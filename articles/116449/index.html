  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Operator! Stop debts</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/53c99603/2c0add93/eb77a808/0eb6cecf.jpg"><br><br>  Why are operators being driven into the minus without the consent of the owner?  I have long been interested in this question.  After all, the connection uses 2 types of payment, credit and advance.  Most ordinary citizens choose "advance".  Going into the porch today, I discovered the distribution of "debtor cards" from MTS.  Once a year (sometimes more often) they appear, put in almost every drawer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Our family still in the shaggy year of 2001 disconnected from this operator due to the mysterious withdrawal of funds.  First, the funds are not removed, and then at once they were driven into the minus.  As far as I remember, at the time when I was still a schoolboy, withdrawals took place within 3-4 hours.  But when the withdrawal took place once a week, it was not funny.  Next was the magic Beeline, with its mystery of GPRS and WAP settings.  I downloaded the icq application in 30 minutes, ‚Äì2500rub.  Although now this is not known.  Even then, I was disturbed by the mystery of the contract, because I signed under the words ‚Äúan advance settlement system‚Äù and perceived it as such.  Starting to read the contract, found a huge amount of clarification, as expected in favor of the operator.  Before that, he did not read the contract, because he connected to the services spontaneously and there was no time to read the text.  From this I singled out for myself: ‚ÄúYou need to read the contract at home, even before connection‚Äù.  Marketing tricks have not yet guessed to put a beautiful girl on the text of the contract, which is above the soul and mentally twists at the temple "Fool chtol?  Sign, come on, faster. ‚Äù  When I was vacationing in Turkey, I was sitting in a cafe and a guy from the USA was sitting not far from me.  So he, as soon as the funds ran out, the operator executed the lock.  No explanations, they say, we did not immediately withdraw funds, did not send.  As he explained, the amount of the debt is stipulated in the contract of $ 5.  Consequently, account blocking is operatively possible.  Even when roaming, the guest operator requests a limit, therefore, our operators do not set a limit.  I am very disappointed with the answers like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm guilty myself, I had to read the contract and think with my head‚Äù or ‚ÄúBut you didn‚Äôt know that you can‚Äôt use the Internet when roaming.‚Äù  This is the topic of debt of the newlyweds abroad.  With the same logic, you can argue "Do not fig walking on the street, you can get hit by a drunk driver."  The fact that everything is legal and lawlessness is not here, I can not agree either.  If everything is legal, then we need to turn the law so that they are written for the population.  Realizing that I was not alone interested in this issue, I decided to find out who controls the operators.  Presumably the Ministry of Communications and Mass Telecommunications of the Russian Federation.  There I decided to ask for clarification.  After all, by zomboyaschiku basically answer, as they are comfortable.  And the answer received from them:

I am interested in the time.  In the next couple of months, I hope the answer is still getting.  Many say: "The meaning of somewhere to write and do something, still nothing will change."  I want to immediately notice exactly what they say and do nothing.  That's how we live. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116449/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116449/</a></p>
