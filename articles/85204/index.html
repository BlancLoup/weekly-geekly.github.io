  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Five guaranteed ways to reduce your earnings on freelancing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Habr√© a lot of freelancing is discussed.  Many give advice on how to start a freelance career and how to succeed by doing everything right.  However, all truly successful people do not follow the rules.  Each success story is different in its own way and unique.  There are no such rules, following which it is possible to achieve success.  But the stories of failures are always similar to each other.  This also applies to freelancing. <br>  I have my own small <a href="http://www.icons4swrus.com/">icon design</a> studio and the night before I once again <s>glanced</s> through the freelancers profiles on the freelancing <s>site of the</s> famous site in search of interesting personalities.  Five "deadly sins" were carefully collected in this article and now you have a complete guide to action. <br>  So, in order to be guaranteed to reduce your earnings on freelancing, you need ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ... reduce the number of employers who have written to you.  And for this:

      <b>1. In the portfolio we shove everything that we have ever done, or we can.</b>  <b>In the art school painted still lifes?</b>  <b>Well, this is in the "Drawings" section.</b>  <b>3D Max book read?</b>  <b>Yy yy</b>  <b>Examples from the book in the section "3D design".</b>  <b>There are more banners, training logos from the institute, and, well, from the last work of polygraphy to stick.</b>  <b>Ltd.</b>  <b>Beauty.</b>  <b>Now the customer will look and think, what I am the master of all trades!</b> <br>  In fact, when you enter a freelancer profile, you try to determine who he is, what he can do better and what he specializes in.  If you go to a page looking for an interface designer and see that a person does everything they offer, then you don‚Äôt want to work with this.  Highlight the main specialization and mercilessly reduce everything else.  So you will look like a specialist and expert.  They love more and pay better. <br><br>  <b>2. Immediately write that we work only on a prepaid or transaction without risk.</b>  <b>To stupid questions are not asked, you can also add that in case of failure, I leave the prepayment to myself.</b>  <b>Why?</b>  <b>We know these customers.</b>  <b>They do not lie a finger in his mouth, they will take a bite to the elbow ...</b> <br>  When I see such an inscription, I get the feeling that I am not welcome.  The man does not know me, but does not trust me anymore.  I will write to him, and he will start setting conditions instead of trying to help me? .. Despite the fact that I understand the need for prepayments, poking my nose into prepayment conditions significantly discourages writing. <br>  Plus, customers freelancers throw too.  Each side has its own experience.  Once thrown, the customer does not want to give a prepayment, but he can be very promising ... <br><br>  <b>3. We write the phone, ICQ, Skype and specify in what cases you can use these contacts.</b>  <b>And then you never know, they will start calling at night, get me ...</b> <br>  Diko just read: "Communication only via PM, Skype only after a personal conversation."  Question: Why do you leave contact details?  Is it really not clear that from such explanations one can hear: ‚ÄúDon't touch me‚Äù?  You do not want to write, do not indicate contacts.  In a double way from the fact that all these conditions are described in the main description of the questionnaire.  This place is one of the main ones in the questionnaire, and is it spent on placing pegs for which the customer should not enter? <br><br>  <b>4. Graft works are unusual.</b>  <b>We make out each small prefix in our own style in order to give the questionnaire your own, unique style and atmosphere.</b> <br>  Of all these profiles I did not like one.  I like practical profiles.  I want it to be convenient for me to look through my portfolio, I want it to take a minimum of time.  Oddly enough, a reduced image generated automatically, as a rule, meets these requirements. <br>  If I'm looking for an interface designer, then I want to see the interfaces, not the start-ups logos for which they were designed.  If I'm looking for a designer for toolbar icons, I want to see that the freelancer has experience in developing large sets of small icons, and not the three most beautiful ones in the original size.  It will be necessary - I will click on the graft and see the original size. <br><br>  <b>5. In the case of receiving the order, we certainly write in the questionnaire that they are busy.</b>  <b>First, it was not for nothing that they made such a function on the site, and secondly, it was more solid.</b>  <b>I have a queue of orders, I need a lot ...</b> <br>  This inscription acts on me as a closed posture during a conversation.  Busy?  Well, I will not distract, I will go further to look.  It's good that the list of freelancers is long ... Why write this?  This inscription scares customers.  Not all of them need a job right now (for example, I periodically look for people for the future).  Or maybe you will be offered an interesting project that you simply can‚Äôt refuse, would work at night, quit your job?  Putting this inscription you cut off some of the promising messages.  Even when working on a serious project, think ahead.  Keep communicating with potential customers.  Answer that you are busy until such and such a date, but do not write this stupid inscription! <br><br>  This is not all noticed slips, but perhaps one of the most frequent.  Be guided by healthy logic when filling out the questionnaire and try to become a customer.  The customer needs a friendly performer who can solve his problem for the agreed money.  Reliable, responsible, respectful and creatively suited to the problem of the customer.  Be so and customers will certainly catch up. <br><br>  <i>Successes in your hard business, gentlemen freelancers :)</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85204/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85204/</a></p>
