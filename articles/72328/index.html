Started!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since childhood, we are taught, who works more - he earns more.  Many believe that in order to double the income, you need to get a second job.  In life, everything is exactly the opposite. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When I first started my own business, I worked alone.  I was looking for orders myself, I executed them myself.  My earnings depended directly on the time spent in the office at work.  But while executing orders, time was missed for which new customers could be found, which means money was lost.  At that time, a friend joined me and the first thing we hired was a sales manager.  There were more orders.  We didn‚Äôt have time to do all the work together, we had to take the first employee who would do the work for us, then one more, then the second sales manager, then the second contractor, then the driver, etc ... In the end, we could only control the quality of the work of the team, now we have a person who is engaged in this.

      Why am I telling this?  Many at the beginning of their business path do all the work themselves.  "Of course!  I don‚Äôt have enough money to pay someone a salary! ‚ÄùHe thinks.  And so it turns out, the money earned for the month with a stretch is enough for him.  Of course, to earn one for two is much more difficult than the two for one.  There is a good expression "Who works a lot, there is no time to earn." <br><br>  The output is as follows.  Stop for 1 day, well, at least for 1 evening or a few hours, sit down and think (I am particularly good at thinking about working in a car, only turn off the radio).  Tell customers that they turned off the lights in the office (Internet, telephone, gas, water, oxygen).  You need to think about which part of your work you can assign to another person.  We started with a customer search site.  Finding someone who can talk on the phone and write emails is easiest.  More time was freed up and the flow of orders increased at the same time.  An important detail.  The first time, and better, everything else, to take employees not on the salary, but on the piece-rate payment according to the results of labor.  For sales managers it is a percentage of the sum of attracted orders, for a driver, the number of flights, etc.  This, firstly, will allow these costs to be included in full in advance in the price of the service (or product), and, secondly, if the volume of orders falls, it will not burden the already empty wallet and allow you to stay afloat.  If you do not have a computer or a table for which to plant a new employee, look for options on how to transfer work to the side.  There are freelancers, there are students who are ready to work at home, etc. <br><br>  Generally, in 5 years of work, I came to the conclusion that the measure of business success is the inverse of the amount of time spent on running this business.  The most successful business is the one for which your time is not needed at all.  He works by himself.  Like a clock.  It only needs to ‚Äúwind up‚Äù - to give direction for movement.  Why is this so?  Because the less you work, the more time you have to THINK.  You can look at the matter from the outside, evaluate its prospects, come up with new directions or adjust the path.  You must admit that it is difficult to control a steam locomotive while simultaneously throwing coal into the furnace.  In addition, such a business does not need your constant immediate presence.  You can get sick, leave, and your business will not collapse.  Will not stop.  It can be transferred to children, sell in the end.  And further.  Ten people will earn much more money for you than you can earn for yourself. <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72328/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72328/</a></p>
