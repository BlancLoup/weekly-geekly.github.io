So why why?  In the Netherlands, excellent connectivity is probably the best in the world, loyal legislation, and the <a href="http://ua-hosting.com.ua/nl-servers.html">most pleasant prices for the rental of dedicated servers</a> in one of the most reliable data centers, which is perhaps the most important.  Nevertheless, some clients persistently demanded a second location, preferably in another country, owners of rare paranoia also met, and some of the audience was directed to the American continent and there was little direct connectivity to the United States, there were unique people who simply thought that the United States was better , why is it better - they themselves did not know ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba5/2a0/c06/ba52a0c06ced8c0349755b07618819dc.jpg"><br><br>  In July, finally ‚Äúdying‚Äù from boredom and summer coolness, we still thought, not whether to expand our presence on the Internet, adding a new reliable location, especially Jay Devin, one of the main managers in the US, has been campaigning for more than half a year visit COPT DC-6-EvoSwitch / LeaseWeb (Manassas), without stopping vain attempts in the style of "well, order at least something, we also need customers." <a name="habracut"></a>

      Nevertheless, before entrusting our customers to Americans, we wanted to make sure that everything is really high there, since the data center is very different from the Dutch (the owner is not LeaseWeb), and the number of LeaseWeb servers located in Manassas is much lower than in the Netherlands Haarlem - for February of this year, about 3000, which LeaseWeb moved entirely from one server to another: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PL0IrsgYty4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgQWxYa4dU5I4QAUaPUtB4bdBmZkg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Yes, well done guys, what to say ... Servers grow from a smaller server to a larger one, which is probably acceptable at the initial stage.  But even though this was all professionally accomplished (immediately after the end of the transfer, Jay sent a link to the video, apparently they were very proud of the fact that all clients remained intact :)), I didn‚Äôt want to repeat this move and this video even scared me a little more action, although Jay guaranteed that this will not happen again and now the expansion will take place on a different scheme. <br><br>  There was a time in July and a reason - they decided to check, and why not.  Although July is certainly not the best time to visit the United States, it‚Äôs hot, but since our Dutch colleagues were there at that time, other issues could be solved at the same time and you could have a good time.  After seeing the forecast, where they promised a joyful +33 for the day after tomorrow, they bought tickets to Washington.  Never believe gismeteo predictions if they concern the USA!  If in other regions they are more or less true, then in the USA they probably have problems with accuracy ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/952/15c/608/95215c608ebb3b6dd5f8a1e9bd44ac26.jpg"><br><br>  Upon arrival in Washington with a delay of one hour (which is consistently observed on AirFrance flights, I‚Äôll do anti-advertising, even on Habr√©, they got it, the French :)), this time because of searching for passenger‚Äôs baggage, who wanted to leave a huge two-story plane the moment, the joyful voice of the flight attendant told us that it was sunny outside, the temperature was 114 degrees Fahrenheit or +45 Celsius.  I thought it was wrong ... But after leaving the air-conditioned airport, they realized that it was not, +45 in the shade, even more in the sun ... The benefit of a taxi was not far away.  We were told that in the USA there is an abnormal heat for several days.  It was just hell, the radio broadcast about the victims of this abnormal weather and the increase in the number of "cooling stations", where you could recover.  It became interesting how the data center functions in such temperatures :) <br><br>  I immediately remembered a case in Moscow, when during an abnormal summer heat at temperatures much lower, the servers in several data centers shut down, since the air conditioning did not cope, and then +45 in the shade ... Whoever has ever been in such extreme temperatures, you know - it's only interesting a minute then you think how to escape from it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/18f/f4e/e43/18ff4ee43e1183e6db27708d35ed04b1.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps it is good that the first in the program was an inspection of the air-conditioned data center.  The next day, early in the morning, having left the center of Washington (and we stayed in a hotel on Capitol Hill, I recommend the Capitol Hill Hotel of the same name if you want to visit the capital, though the best option), in spite of the small trudge in the city in 50 minutes we were in Manassas.  Another 10 minutes was spent searching for the LeaseWeb office building, which is quite far from the data center, lost among other office buildings, and has a new number, which for some reason is not in the GPS database. <br><br>  Nevertheless, there were.  Jay and Yulia, who met us and envied our shorts and light T-shirts (Jay's first words are ‚ÄúI would wear shorts too, if I knew you were wearing shorts‚Äù :), who were themselves in business style in such hot weather, invited me to go to their office.  In the office, unlike the street, there was a terrible cold, Americans have an unhealthy perception of conditioning, apparently they do not know that sudden drops in more than 10 degrees are extremely harmful for an ordinary person.  Immediately, the difference in temperatures of more than 25 degrees (on the street more than +45 in the shade, indoors +20, and maybe less), the shock to the body is huge! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/94b/7f7/e93/94b7f7e9327d51a8b1655baa05f0969a.jpg"><br><br>  Now to the main point - about the data center.  LeaseWeb has significantly fewer employees in the United States than in the Netherlands, less than two dozen people, because the data center operator is not EvoSwitch / LeaseWeb, but COPT, which manages the Data Center, ensures its work and security, providing customers with the infrastructure for housing cabinets and servers. <br><br><h4>  Corporate Office Properties Trust (COPT) </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ A public mortgage investment trust with a total capital of over $ 4 billion. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Owns, developed and / or performs the management of Data Centers with a total usable area of ‚Äã‚Äãover 200,000 square meters.  meters, including COPT DC-6 in Manassas, Va. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Awarded numerous awards. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Has experience in working with specialized US government data centers. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Has experience in working with sensitive compartment information objects (SCIF) and in the design of communication rooms. <br><br><h5>  COPT DC-6 (formerly Power Loft) </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4f/a5a/6c6/d4fa5a6c6822a5554379219755cbee72.jpg"><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ 3,600 square meters of directly usable space for hosting IT infrastructure. <br>  ‚Ä¢ 5 MW maximum power. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to expand to 9 MW and 2,600 square meters for 6 months. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Container compartment modules are available for placement. <br><br><h5>  Low cost of operation: </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ Using the environment for cooling saves 10% of energy or $ 144,000 / year. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The power efficiency is 1.3 (versus the industry average of 1.8), which gives savings of $ 240,000 / year. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Own water resources provide savings of $ 26,400 / year. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Total annual savings in COPT DC-6 are $ 4,10400 / year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8ce/1bd/faa/8ce1bdfaa4c36e93fadfcccd1fd64700.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Tax savings: </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ Equipment tax is 70% less in COPT DC-6 (Prince William District) than in the center of Ashburn (Laudun District) or in Fairfax County. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Savings of $ 125,000 per million invested in equipment for 10 years. <br><br><h5>  Security features: </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ 22 miles from Ashburn and, accordingly, from the concentration of risks for the Data Center. <br>  ‚Ä¢ ATFD (ANTI TERRORISM / FORCE PROTECTION) patrols the site more than 50 meters from the building. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Engineering systems are separated from IT objects. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Space to accommodate sensitive data bays allocated and ready to use. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Meets requirements of the US Security Department and Central Intelligence Directives. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Complies with the requirements of the FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act - Federal Law "On Ensuring Information Security"). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4d/5b2/9d9/b4d5b29d98546592ef2b3bac1b6470b4.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Solutions for modular data centers: </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ Ready territory plan. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Support for double-width containers. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Use of available cooling water resources, UPS and generators. <br><br><h4>  Advantages of Manassas </h4><br><h5>  Advantages of the location of the Data Center in Manassas: </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ 22 miles from Ashburn and its regional risk concentration for Data Centers. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Location outside the main routes of Dulles International Airport. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Tax on property of individuals in Prince-William County is 70% lower than in Loudoun County. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The cost of total operation is lower than at Ashburn Data Centers. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Compliance with all location requirements for Data Centers. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Use of a power grid separate from Ashburn City. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05d/ab9/5f3/05dab95f3fa2a580524d6d0ea0829902.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Connectivity and delays: </h5><br>  ‚Ä¢ The Innovation Park in Manassas, Prince William County, is extremely rich in fiber-optic networks. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Multiple retail and wholesale backbone providers provide direct and secure connection to traffic exchange points in Ashburn and to the main state traffic exchange points of Virginia, Maryland and Washington. <br>  ‚Ä¢ No difference in latency between Manassas and Ashburn. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The delay to the regional NAP (network access point) is 5 times less than in the service agreement of the New York Stock Exchange. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Selected dark fiber connections to government sites are available. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Certification capabilities include FISMA (Federal Information Security Management Act - Federal Law "On Ensuring Information Security"), ITIL (IT Infrastructure Library - Information Technology Infrastructure Library) and SAS 70 / SAE 18 (Audit Standards Act No. 70 / Community automotive engineers, act 18). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/860/242/b34/860242b346de6e970de5cc292e246e0a.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Reliable fiber and communications infrastructure </h4><br>  COPT DC-6 provides reliable fiber optic communications from companies such as AboveNet, Level 3 Communications, FiberLight, Verizon, Comcast and NOVEC.  Many providers are located nearby, due to which getting their services is extremely simplified.  The state safe connection is located in close proximity, direct connection is possible according to the approved requirements. <br><br>  The location of the COPT DC-6 allows you to connect directly with several providers to the main network access point located in Ashburn, Virginia. <br><br>  Fiber-optic providers have access to the Data Center through two different underground inputs and fiber-optic connections go directly to two different switching rooms, interconnection nodes (MMR).  The connection is distributed over two additional MMRs, providing a total of four MMRs.  Due to this, one MMR covers 2300 square meters of raised floor, providing multiple paths and redundant connections to each Data Center area. <br><br><h4>  COPT DC-6: Square and Rack Plan </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f2c/f61/bb3/f2cf61bb3e5aac7ac8a94302f9c3be3f.jpg"><br><br><h5>  WESTERN WING \ Section 201-208 </h5><br>  Available now: <br>  Section 203-205 <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1560 sq.
