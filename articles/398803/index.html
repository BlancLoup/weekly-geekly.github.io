The same habit has successfully migrated to the Internet - we can update the news feed or social networks purely by inertia.  But the special scope of this fun gets during sales in online stores: 11.11, Black Friday, etc.  But this is no longer an unconscious verification of the site, but an update in anticipation of new interesting products.  To be honest, sometimes it takes time, and the result is often zero.  We decided to take an unprecedented step for ourselves - and for the first time tell you what interesting products will be on short flash sales and at what time.  In some places we will reveal the most terrible secret - prices. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00a/8da/49e/00a8da49e41741ba80ccca9a490af033.gif" width="270"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, not only electronics and gadgets will be involved in <a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/cDUrj6Bakwy4oJI.html">flash sales</a> - there are bags and clothes, watches, toys and a lot of stuff.  But we tried to choose goods that will be useful to everyone, useful or interesting from a technical point of view and will be sold at the lowest price.  Please note that there is a lot in the lists of what fits the definition of ‚Äúfirst tablet or first smartphone‚Äù for a school child.  It is necessary to please their excellent students and motivate losers in the new year! <br><br>  By the way, until you forget - today you can choose the products that you like and put them as favorites.  At the moment when the flash sale starts, you just look at the price and select or remove the product from the wish list.  This is important because some products will be sold in limited quantities.
