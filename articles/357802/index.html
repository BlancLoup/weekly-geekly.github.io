This email service is one of the most secure in the world.  For example, all information is encrypted on the client side, and all servers of the service are located in Switzerland.  In this country it is very difficult, if not impossible, to gain access to private information.

      <br>
      Pretty quickly, the service became so popular that developers had to introduce a system of invites.  The authors of the project began to raise funds for additional servers.  Those who donated something received an invite.  In 2014, I <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/240962/">received an invite</a> and I, so I can fully appreciate the convenience and reliability of the service as a user.  For all the time when working with secure mail, there have never been any problems with it, plus the developers have added useful features several times.  Now everyone can evaluate ProtonMail, since the authors of the project made it <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/launch/">open to everyone</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company that created the service claims that at the time of exit from the beta stage, ProtonMail had a million users.  As already mentioned, previously, a system of donations was used to keep the service running (equipment purchase, maintenance support team, etc.).  Now, after opening the service, it was removed, and introduced a new system of paid accounts.  Users of such accounts are provided with a number of additional features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e6a/e17/6b2/e6ae176b26c4e979045383efaad49bc1.png"><br>  <i>Protonmail system architecture (2014)</i> <br><br>  Two-password authentication and client-side encryption now work in ProtonMail.  As for authentication, the first password is required to verify the user.  The second - to decrypt messages in the box.  Everything works automatically, the scheme is approximately the same as in the case of PGP, and all this is in the browser; no additional software is required to download.  It is possible to send a secure message to the user of a third-party service. The encryption uses the AES-256 algorithm with a password that must be known to both the addressee and the sender.  In the email received by the addressee, there is a link that sends to the ProtonMail server.  In this case, the recipient will see a link to the message, which can be read by entering a password. <br><br>  The client-side software is <a href="https://protonmail.com/blog/protonmail-open-source/">open</a> , the source code of applications for mobile devices and PCs will also be opened soon. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357802/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357802/</a></p>
