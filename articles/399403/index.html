Release the shoulder girdle and neck.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Frequent advice to a tense person: ‚ÄúWhat is strained - relax, enjoy ...‚Äù.  What happens as a result?  - The man is straining even more! <br><br>  In the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/282966/">last article</a> you met with the main problems that cause pain in your hands when working at a computer. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d8/378/1c3/8d83781c3ea14f319312f92bd9d87765.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Now it's time to practice.  Tension in the neck and shoulder girdles - ‚Äúnot removable load on the shoulders‚Äù is the most common problem that people, as a teacher of somatics, turn to for help.  Today we will learn to relieve tension in the neck and shoulder girdle. <br><br>  The lesson will take 15-20 minutes, you can do it sitting without leaving your computer.  Under the cut - a video of the lesson, the rules for the implementation of somatic lessons and text interpretation of the extended version of the lesson (carefully - a lot of letters!).

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTT7YNGf6FU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Rules for the implementation of lessons:</b> <br><br>  Each situation from the lesson should be worked out, following the rules for the implementation of somatic lessons: <br><br><ol><li>  All movements are performed in the comfort zone - if you feel pain or you have to strain hard to make a movement, then reduce the amplitude, make the movement more smoothly and slowly, you can even work out the movement mentally.  Remember that it‚Äôs not the muscles and bones that learn - the brain learns.  Comfort is the main requirement for quality learning. <br><br></li><li>  The movements are performed at a slow and smooth pace - the slower and more smoothly the movements are performed, the higher the quality of your training. <br><br></li><li>  Do the movements of the lesson in the ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù mode, keep focused on your feelings at the time of the situations from the lesson.  If you think about what happened or what will happen, chase them away. <br><br></li><li>  Look for the difference in the ease of performing the movements and in the sensations before and after working through the situation - the more differences you notice, the greater will be the effect of the lesson. <br><br></li><li>  Make mistakes.  The more you make and notice mistakes in the implementation of the lesson, while maintaining a feeling of comfort, the easier it will be for you to find exactly the movement opportunities that will be most correct, easy, and joyful for you. <br><br></li><li>  After completing the lesson do not rush to give the load in full force, trying a new quality of movement, you can activate old habits.  Try to move slowly, savoring every gesture - many lessons allow you to get a significant effect in completely unexpected situations.  For example, after performing the lessons of dynamic sitting on a chair, you will be able to note that walking has become qualitatively different and the posture has changed while standing. <br></li></ol><br>  For those who were able to get to this line, the bonus is an expanded version of the lesson in text form. <br><br>  <b>Initially test the tone of the shoulder glands:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  The hand is easy enough to consciously control, because it is easier to relax.  Relax your left arm and try your right hand to touch the biceps with your left.  Biceps under the fingers gives the impression of the test.  Now try to touch the muscles of the shoulder girdle - if their consistency is denser than the biceps, then the shoulder girdle has an excessive tone. <br><br></li><li>  With long-term tension in the muscle, zones of increased pain sensitivity are formed; with pressure on these points, quite intense pain appears.  If you find such points in the shoulder girdle, this means that you have overvoltage the muscles in your shoulder glands for more than a week, at least, and maybe for several years. <br><br></li><li>  There is such an expression ‚Äúthe burden of responsibility‚Äù, it often oppresses the modern man.  Look at yourself in the mirror - often high-raised shoulder joints and shoulder girdle, parallel to the floor, show increased tone in the muscles of the shoulder girdle. <br></li></ol><br>  Now, sit down comfortably, so that both legs are firmly on the floor, the angle at the knee and hip joints is close to 90 degrees.  Arms are relaxed, resting on your hips. <br><br>  <b>Situation 1</b> <br><br>  In tact with the breath, lift the right shoulder joint up and then lower it to its original position.  When you inhale, you raise, while exhaling, you lower it to its original position - slowly and smoothly.  Repeat a few times and rest, appreciate the changes. <br><br>  <b>Situation 2</b> <br><br>  In tact with breathing, lower the right shoulder joint down and then lift it to its original position.  On exhalation - lower, on inhalation - raise to the starting position.  Remember that movements are performed in a minimal amount.  Make a movement a comfortable number of times and rest, compare the shoulder girdle. <br><br>  <b>Situation 3</b> <br><br>  Move your right shoulder joint forward to the beat and return it to its original position several times.  Concentrate on what is happening, notice how the muscles contract and lengthen as they work.  Take a rest. <br><br>  <b>Situation 4</b> <br><br>  Move your right shoulder joint back to the beat and return it to its original position several times.  At the end, while relaxing, appreciate the intermediate result. <br><br>  <b>Situation 5</b> <br><br>  Movement of the right shoulder joint in a circle: on the inhale, move the shoulder joint backward, towards the end of the inhalation phase, move it upwards, at the beginning of the expiration phase - forward, at the end of the exhalation - down, starting a new inhale again backwards.  Try to perform this movement as smoothly as possible and with a minimum amplitude. <br><br>  <b>Situation 6</b> <br><br>  Movement in a circle in the other direction: while inhaling, move the shoulder joint up, at the end of the inhale - back, at the beginning of the expiratory phase down, at the end of the exhale - forward, starting a new breath - again upwards.  Perform movements smoothly, if it does not work out, and movements occur by jerks between control points, then try to put several intermediate points for making movements. <br><br>  Check the tension of the shoulder glands, and try to work the other side mentally, without making movements in reality, just by imagining them.  Compare the result. <br><br>  PS The third article of the cycle devoted to the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/283096/">scalenus syndrome has been</a> published. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399403/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399403/</a></p>
