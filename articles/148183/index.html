      <b>1. Position of Intel and Microsoft</b> <br><br>  Let's start with Microsoft, with the announcement of Windows 8, the company's top managers have made it clear that Microsoft is moving towards the unification of all its operating systems.  That is, the company from Redmond is trying to translate in one operating system all the good things that exist on tablets, laptops, and even smartphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9da/ff0/527/9daff05278a4df9b968206d1a67bd469.png"><br><br>  Exactly 10 years ago with the release of Windows Mobile, Microsoft is going to transfer a single interface to different types of devices.  The only difference is that if Windows Mobile copied the interface of the desktop version, then Windows XP, then today, Windows 8 copies the interface, first proposed in Windows Phone 7. How quickly the development vectors changed, didn't they?  ) <br><br>  The situation is very ambiguous, Microsoft is well aware that they have clicked on the tablet segment and want, albeit belatedly, to enter this market.  To do this, Metro UI was created - a new shell designed for easy ‚Äúfinger control‚Äù.  The new interface is not bad, and it runs fast on tablets.  But bad luck, Windows 8 for tablets and for desktop systems will not be visually different.  That is, Metro UI - the basis of the new OS, developed for the sensor, will be transferred to ordinary, stationary, non-touch PCs. <br><br>  The step is very bold, because last time, such a transfer of ‚Äúmuscular Windows‚Äù to ‚Äúsensory-stylus Windows‚Äù turned into a failure for Microsoft, and the iPhone‚Äôs release proved this failure again.  Although the company says that Windows 8 is a new generation of OS, a rewritten version, etc.  But, in the "eight" there is still an old desktop, an old system of folders and drives, and what can we say about those thousands of "mouse programs."  Metro UI - although it has its own, optimized applications, and a new ideology of management, but still is a ‚Äúcake‚Äù of the eight, and not a birthday cake. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c6f/4a2/7a0/c6f4a27a0bd28ca70c1cc8abcacabc48.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Windows 8 is an intermediate link that should show whether the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcommunism deserves a single interface on all devices the right to life.</b>  <b>If yes, then in Windows 9 there will be no explorer and daddies at all.</b>  <b>And if not, then Microsoft is screwing up again.</b> <br><br>  Personally, I used Windows 8 for about 2 weeks, and you know, all these weeks I was overwhelmed with the thought of not very rationally spent time.  To control Metro UI from a mouse, you have to make a lot of unnecessary clicks, and as a result, spend time managing the system, not working.  The same actions in the G-7 happen faster.  As a result, I abandoned Metro UI and used the ‚Äúold interface‚Äù, thank God, it was left almost intact. <br><br>  Let's continue with Intel, like Microsoft, the processor giant clicked on the tablet output, more precisely the smartphone output, and more precisely, the output of energy-efficient devices.  From the very beginning of computer engineering, the glands worked from the socket.  Accordingly, the manufacturers of "stones" did not try to save on electricity, there was a performance race. <br><br>  But with the advent of laptops, the first who wanted independence from wires, at least a couple of hours were users.  Intel certainly listened to this niche of human-like buyers, but there were no particularly noticeable jumps in the life expectancy of laptops. <br><br>  The development of mankind does not stand still and the first PDAs began to appear on the market, then smartphones.  They were very tiny compared to the same laptops, and they were based on completely different processors that, due to a different architecture, were not compatible with desktop OS versions. <br><br>  The share of such devices was worthless, and the performance of such ‚Äúproducts‚Äù did not shine, and again the iPhone became a turning point.  Let not the first generation, iPhone 3Gs showed that the smartphone can easily handle complex three-dimensional graphics, while working more than a day.  Android device manufacturers picked up the whole thing, and it went off. <br><br>  As a result, today, Intel can not provide an adequate response to energy efficient ARM processors, and in the long run may remain with nothing.  <b>"Eight", in fact, iron from smartphones and tablets supports, albeit with reservations.</b> <br><br>  Therefore, this whole epic with "new" ultrabooks is just a rubber product, whose task is to take time and prevent PC manufacturers from trying to work with ARM architecture in their products.  Although, of course, the power of ‚Äúmobile‚Äù hardware is weaker than that of Intel, but some hybrid solutions can be created. <br><br>  <b>2. Apple Position</b> <br><br>  The position of the Apple Company is as simple as possible and is characterized by the following quote: ‚ÄúA touchpad or ultrabook is the same as combining a toaster with a refrigerator, an entertaining thing, but hardly anyone will buy it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/520/4e1/d9c/5204e1d9c5ab1e0792be642f56d2571e.jpg"><br><br>  And if more serious, then we will remember 2010.  Everyone was waiting for a tablet computer from Apple, of course with the MacOS based.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/148060/">(by the way, they waited for this) The</a> units could suggest that the word ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù could be a device with a telephone processor and an operating system (then they just renamed iPhoneOS in iOS).  Steve Jobs showed the world the development vector of Apple, a vector that clearly divides the device into two types: sensory and non-sensory. <br><br>  The same division goes on the functional component.  In the ideology of Apple, the iPhone and iPad are devices that consume content.  They are designed as simple, easy and long-playing.  And products with the word Mac in the basis - the devices on which this very content is created. <br><br>  People who consume are much more than people who create.  Because of what tablets and smartphones become so popular.  All the functionality of the operating system, which Microsoft is proud of, and the performance, which Intel is proud of, simply disappear, in front of the same Angry Birds toy.  The average user does not need a professional operating system and powerful hardware for everyday tasks, he needs a lot of animation in the ‚Äúmenu‚Äù and more than 10 hours of battery life. <br><br>  In my opinion, the approach of Apple is more correct, that of Microsoft.  But do not forget about Google with its Android.  The position of which is even simpler - I stick my nose in something else in any hole where I don‚Äôt.
