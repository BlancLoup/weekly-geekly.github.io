In general, it's time to continue the glorious tradition and talk about the most significant changes, which we will make, guided by public information from the project: <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/177LIKnO3yUmE0ryIg9OBek54Y-abw8OE8pq-9QgnGM4/edit">the Kubernetes features tracking table</a> , <a href="">CHANGELOG-1.12</a> , numerous issues, pull requests and design proposals.  So what's new in K8s 1.12? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Storage </h2><br>  If you single out one thing that is most often mentioned among all the issues related to the release of Kubernetes 1.12, it will probably become the <b>Container Storage Interface (CSI)</b> , which we <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/424211/">have already written</a> about the other day.  For this reason, let's start with the changes in storage support.

      <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/178">The CSI plugins,</a> as such, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/178">have retained</a> beta status and are awaiting recognition as stable by the next release of Kubernetes (1.13).  What is new in CSI support then? <br><br>  In February of this year <a href="https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/pull/188">,</a> work <a href="https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/pull/188">began</a> on <b>the topology concept</b> in the CSI specification itself.  In short, topology is information about cluster segmentation (for example, by ‚Äúracks‚Äù for on-premise installations or by ‚Äúregions‚Äù and ‚Äúzones‚Äù for cloud environments) that you need to know and take into account orchestration systems.  What for?  The volumes allocated by storage providers will not necessarily be equally accessible throughout the cluster, and therefore knowledge of the topology is necessary in order to effectively plan resources and make decisions on provisioning. <br><br>  The result of the appearance of topologies in CSI ( <a href="https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/pull/188">taken</a> in the specification on June 1) was their support in Kubernetes 1.12: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/557">support as such</a> (registration of information about the volume topology reported by the CSI driver) - alpha version; </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/561">support of topologies in dynamic provisioning</a> (see detailed documentation in the design proposal called ‚Äú <a href="">Volume Topology-aware Scheduling</a> ‚Äù) - right away is a beta version; </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/558">GCE PD topology support</a> - alpha version; </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/567">AWS EBS Topology Support</a> - Beta. </li></ul><br>  But the CSI-related updates don't end there.  Another important innovation in the release of Kubernetes 1.12 - <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/177"><b>support snapshots</b> for CSI</a> (while in the status of the alpha version).  Snapshots for volumes as such appeared in the <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/338230/">release of K8s 1.8</a> .  The main implementation, which includes the controller and the provisioner (two separate binaries), was decided to be transferred to the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/external-storage/tree/master/snapshot">external repository</a> .  Since then, support has appeared for GCE PD, AWS EBS, OpenStack Cinder, GlusterFS, and Kubernetes <code>hostPath</code> . <br><br>  The new <a href="">design proposal is</a> intended to ‚Äúcontinue this initiative by adding support for CSI Volume Drivers‚Äù (support for CSI in the CSI specification is described <a href="https://github.com/container-storage-interface/spec/pull/224">here</a> ).  Since Kubernetes adheres to the principle of including a minimal set of capabilities in the core API, this implementation (as for snapshots in Volume Snapshot Controller) uses CRD ( <code>CustomResourceDefinitions</code> ). <br><br>  And a couple of new features for CSI drivers: <br><br><ul><li>  The alpha version of the driver's ability to <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/594">register itself</a> with the Kubernetes API (in order to make it easier for users to detect the drivers installed in the cluster and allow the drivers to influence the interaction processes of Kubernetes with them); </li><li>  The alpha version of the driver's ability <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/603">to receive information about the file</a> that requested the volume through <code>NodePublish</code> . </li></ul><br>  Presented in the last release of Kubernetes, the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/554">mechanism of dynamic limiting of</a> volumes on nodes advanced from alpha to beta, <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/554">having received</a> ... you guessed it, support for CSI, as well as Azure. <br><br>  Finally, the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/432">Mount namespace propagation</a> feature, which allows to mount the volume as <code>rshared</code> (so that all mounted container directories are visible on the host) and which had beta status in the <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/353114/">release of K8s 1.10</a> , is declared stable. <br><br><h2>  Scheduler </h2><br>  In the Kubernetes 1.12 scheduler, performance is improved thanks to the alpha version of the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/66627">mechanism for limiting the</a> search in a cluster of nodes suitable for <i>feasible</i> planning.  If earlier for each scheduling attempt of each pod, <i>kube-scheduler</i> checked the availability of all nodes and passed them for evaluation, now the scheduler will find only a certain number of them, and then stop its work.  In this case, the mechanism provides for the mandatory selection of nodes from different regions and zones, as well as the need to view different nodes in different planning cycles (do not select the first 100 nodes each launch).  The decision on the implementation of this mechanism was made, guided by the results of the analysis of data on the performance of the scheduler (if the 90th percentile showed 30 ms for the hearth, then the 99th showed already 60 ms). <br><br>  In addition, the following scheduler features have matured to the beta version: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/">Taint node by Condition</a> , which appeared in K8s 1.8 and allows you to mark a node with a certain status (for further actions) upon the occurrence of certain events: now the node's life cycle controller automatically creates taints, and the scheduler checks them (instead of <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/">conditions</a> ); </li><li>  scheduling pods in <code>DaemonSet</code> using <i>kube-scheduler</i> (instead of the <code>DaemonSet</code> controller): it was also made active by default; </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/612">specifying the priority class</a> in <code>ResourceQuota</code> . </li></ul><br><h2>  Cluster nodes </h2><br>  An interesting innovation was the emergence (in alpha status) of the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/585"><code><b>RuntimeClass</b></code></a> , a new cluster-level resource designed to serve the parameters of the container <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/585"><code><b>RuntimeClass</b></code></a> environment <i>(container runtime)</i> .  <code>RuntimeClasses</code> are assigned to the pods through the same field in the <code>PodSpec</code> and implement support for using multiple executable environments within a cluster or node.  What for? <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúInterest in using different executable environments in a cluster is growing.</i>  <i>At the moment, the main motivator for this are sandboxes (sandboxes) and the desire of Kata and gVisor containers to integrate with Kubernetes.</i>  <i>In the future, other runtime models like Windows containers or even remote executable environments will also need support.</i>  <i>RuntimeClass offers a way to choose between different executable environments configured in a cluster and change their properties (both by the cluster and by the user). "</i> </blockquote><br>  To choose between predefined configurations, a Container Runtime Interface (CRI) is passed to the <a href=""><code>RuntimeHandler</code></a> , which is intended to replace the current annotation of the submission: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wm/jm/yh/wmjmyh4_fivl7msyzb0ghzeqa68.png"><br><br>  And the configuration in containerd for kata-runtime looks like this: <br><br><pre> <code class="plaintext hljs">[plugins.cri.containerd.kata-runtime] runtime_type = "io.containerd.runtime.v1.linux" runtime_engine = "/opt/kata/bin/kata-runtime" runtime_root = ""</code> </pre> <br>  The <code>RuntimeClass</code> criterion for the alpha version is a successful <a href="">CRI validation test</a> . <br><br>  In addition, the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/595">mechanism for registering local plug-ins</a> (including CSI) in <i>Kubelet</i> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/share-process-namespace/"><code>shareProcessNamespace</code></a> grown to beta status (the feature has been enabled by default). <br><br><h2>  Network </h2><br>  The main news in the network part of Kubernetes is the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/614">alpha version of</a> <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_Control_Transmission_Protocol">SCTP</a> support</b> (Stream Control Transmission Protocol).  With support from <i>Pod</i> , <i>Service</i> , <i>Endpoint,</i> and <i>NetworkPolicy</i> , this telecommunications protocol has been extended to include TCP and UDP.  With the new feature, applications that require SCTP as an L4 protocol for their interfaces can be easier deployed to Kubernetes clusters;  for example, they will be able to use service discovery based on <i>kube-dns</i> , and their interaction will be controlled through <i>NetworkPolicy</i> . ‚Äù  Implementation details are available in <a href="">this document</a> . <br><br>  Two network capabilities presented in K8s 1.8 also achieved a stable status: <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/366">support</a> for outgoing traffic <code>EgressRules</code> in the NetworkPolicy API <code>EgressRules</code> and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/367">application of</a> source / recipient CIDR <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/367">rules</a> via <code>ipBlockRule</code> . <br><br><h2>  Scaling </h2><br>  Improvements in the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler include: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/591">updated algorithm</a> for faster achievement of the correct size (both alpha and beta versions at once), for more details about which, read the <a href="">new section of the documentation</a> ; </li><li>  development of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/117">arbitrary / user metrics</a> , the second beta version of which received a revised API and support for label selectors. </li></ul><br>  The <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/tree/master/vertical-pod-autoscaler">vertical scaling of the hearths is also</a> not in place, which, until reaching the beta version, lacked user testing.  The authors found it sufficient for the release of K8s 1.12 and <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/21">remind</a> that this possibility is rather an addition to Kubernetes (not included in the core of the system).  All development is conducted in a separate repository, a beta release in which will be timed to the release of Kubernetes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sl/0e/je/sl0ejeaihoybtqm8khj5y_tkffa.png"><br>  <i>Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) workflow in Kubernetes</i> <br><br>  Finally, K8s 1.12 includes (in the form of an alpha version) the results of <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/115">work</a> on ‚Äúsimplifying the installation using <code>ComponentConfig</code> ‚Äù (within the sig-cluster-lifecycle), which has been going on for almost two years.  Unfortunately, for some unknown reason (a simple oversight?), Access to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1arP4T9Qkp2SovlJZ_y790sBeiWXDO6SG10pZ_UUU-Lc/edit">design proposal document is</a> closed for anonymous users. <br><br><h2>  Other changes </h2><br><h3>  API </h3><br>  Two new features are implemented in the api-machinery group: <br><br><ul><li>  apiserver <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/576"><code> dry-run</code></a> parameter (alpha version), which simulates validation and query processing; </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/587">Resource Quota API</a> (immediately beta), defining <b>limited resources by default</b> (instead of the current behavior, when resource consumption is not limited if no quota is set). </li></ul><br><h3>  Azure </h3><br>  Declared stable: <br><br><ul><li>  Azure Virtual Machine Scale Sets (VMSS) support; </li><li>  Azure <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/514">support</a> in cluster-autoscaler. </li></ul><br>  Added first implementations (alpha versions): <br><br><ul><li>  Azure Availability Zones <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/586">support</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/604">support</a> nodes of the <a href="">cross resource group</a> (RG) type and unmanaged nodes (on-prem). </li></ul><br><h3>  Kubectl </h3><br><ul><li>  An alpha version of the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/579"><b>updated plugin mechanism has been</b></a> implemented, which allows both adding new commands and rewriting existing subcommands of any nesting level.  It is made similar to Git and looks for executable files starting with <code>kubectl-</code> in the user's <code>$PATH</code> .  See the <a href="">design proposal for</a> details. </li><li>  A beta version of the <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/581">idea to allocate the</a> <code>pkg/kubectl/genericclioptions</code> from kubectl to an independent repository has been implemented. </li><li>  <i>Server-side printing has been</i> declared stable. </li></ul><br><h3>  Other </h3><br><ul><li>  An alpha version of the new <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/592"><b>TTL</b></a> mechanism <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/features/issues/592"><b>after finish</b></a> , designed to limit the lifetime of finished <i>Jobs</i> and <i>Pods, is presented</i> .  After a specified TTL, the objects will be automatically cleaned without the need for user intervention. </li><li>  <i>Kubelet</i> private key and CSR (TLS Bootstrap) has been declared stable for signing the certificate at the cluster level. </li><li>  Passed into the status of a beta version of the rotation of the server TLS-certificate in <i>Kubelet</i> . </li></ul><br><h2>  PS </h2><br>  Read also in our blog: <br><br><ul><li>  ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/415349/">Kubernetes 1.11: an overview of major innovations</a> ‚Äù; </li><li>  ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/414875/">Containd integration with Kubernetes, replacing Docker, is ready for production</a> ‚Äù; </li><li>  ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/353114/">Kubernetes 1.10: an overview of major innovations</a> ‚Äù; </li><li>  ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/344220/">Kubernetes 1.9: review of major innovations</a> ‚Äù; </li><li>  ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/344098/">Four releases 1.0 from CNCF and major announcements about Kubernetes from KubeCon 2017</a> ‚Äù; </li><li>  ‚Äú <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/338230/">Kubernetes 1.8: review of major innovations</a> ‚Äù; </li><li>  " <a href="https://habr.com/company/flant/blog/332160/">Docker 17.06 and Kubernetes 1.7: key innovations</a> ." </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424331/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424331/</a></p>
