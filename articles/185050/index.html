  <section class="page js-page"><h1>And once again about motivation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>For hundreds of years, humanity has come up with only two motivators - a carrot in front and a carrot in the back.</i>  <i>But implementations may differ.</i> <i><br></i> <br><h4>  When hobbies coincide with work </h4><br>  People often ask me how to make myself learn - whether programming or learning foreign languages.  For several years, my answer has not changed.  You need to take your hobby (well, do you have some kind of hobby?) And come up with a service, application or website for it. <br><br>  In my student years, I became very interested in MathCAD, spending hours on exponenta.ru (later I became interested in Wolphram Alpha).  So when the desire came to learn PHP at your leisure (at that time everyone wrote in PHP), what the site would be about was not even a choice. <br><br>  For half a year of developing a PHP website about MathCAD from scratch, the following goals were achieved: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ol><li>  Learned PHP at a level sufficient for website development. </li><li>  MathCAD's proficiency level has been raised to an indescribable level. </li><li>  Knowledge of HTML / CSS / JavaScript, SEO, hosting and DNS work was obtained. </li><li>  On the day, 200-300 people went steadily, which was, in my opinion, a success. </li><li>  Later, the acquired knowledge was applied to develop his mathematical software for Windows Phone, writing his Ph.D. and writing a MathCAD workshop for students. </li></ol><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What technologies to make your pet project?  I answer: you need to do the project in turn on different technologies until you realize that a particular platform or technology is right for you, and you want to choose it as the main one for a certain period. <br><br>  In my opinion, the situation when the hobby coincides with the work is just perfect.  The question is that you need to find such an area or occupation. <br><br>  I will make another remark: you never know what knowledge and at what point in time you will need it (and whether it will be useful at all), but it‚Äôs better to suffer from an oversupply of solutions and knowledge than from their absence at the right moment. <br><br><h4>  Challenge!  And only Challenge! </h4><br>  No matter how cool the work is, no matter how much you are paid for it, at some point it will bother you if there is no challenge - a certain task that, as it seems at first, is simply impossible to accomplish.  It is the presence of a task that is the ‚Äúinteresting project‚Äù that is often spoken about during interviews. <br><br>  If there is no task, then you can think of it.  Yes, the authorities do not always share the zeal of their employees to do better, faster, better.  And the initiative, as you know, is often punishable.  But what prevents you in your free time (if you‚Äôre bored, it‚Äôs probably there) to do your own project, self-study, deepening into your own or adjacent subject area?  Self-motivation in our time is no less valuable quality than the mind or thinking outside the box. <br><br><h4>  I know i don't know anything </h4><br>  A well-known phrase, the essence of which is that the more you know, the more you discover new knowledge, with the result that comes the understanding that you really do not know anything.  The paradox is that the cleverest representatives of humanity, as a rule, are very critical of their mental abilities.  But people who are not burdened with intelligence tend to be ‚Äúexperts‚Äù in everything.  Familiar? <br><br><blockquote>  The effect of Dunning - Kruger - cognitive distortion, which lies in the fact that "people with low skill levels, make erroneous conclusions and make bad decisions, and are not able to realize their mistakes due to their low level of skill."  This leads to an overestimation of their own abilities, while really highly qualified people, on the contrary, tend to underestimate their abilities and suffer from a lack of self-confidence, considering others to be more competent.  Thus, less competent people in general have a higher opinion of their own abilities than is typical of competent people, who also tend to assume that others rate their abilities as low as they themselves. </blockquote><br>  How does reading affect motivation?  Very simple.  The more well-read a person is, the less material benefits he seeks in his work.  Maslow's pyramid in action. <br><br><h4>  When the boss - <s>mud ...</s> radish </h4><br>  Very strong motivator.  Moreover, I think that must have in the modern world.  Feelings are different: the strongest anger, mixed with the desire to escape from this pool, balancing on the verge of decency (and sometimes beyond its boundaries), lack of perception of everything that happens and a good school of life.  Such a reality show with your main participation.  It is desirable somewhere in the beginning of a career, so that later any other boss and task seemed to you a task, not a problem (by the way, in English these two concepts are denoted by one word - problem). <br><br>  Although the main thing here is not to overdo it.  After all, you can learn from non-MBA management methods and become the next ‚Äúevil motivator‚Äù yourself. <br><br><h4>  Gamification </h4><br>  Quite a new word of the old as the light of the concept, the point of gamification is to integrate game mechanics into business processes (the main goal of this, as you already guessed, is to increase the motivation of employees).  Well, there is competition inside the team, trips to the nature of aka tim (de) building, etc. <br><br>  Although the main thing - do not overdo it.  Here I am writing good articles (as many people think), but quite mediocrely knocking small objects from a neighbor's head with a bottle tied between my legs (gamification in the process of team building).  And it seems that this skill is not really needed in everyday life, but it‚Äôs still a shame that someone does it better than me.  The second example of bad gamification is the best employee of the month at some OJSC Solnyshko.  On the honor roll, the faces of the best employees look at us with pain, and those who did not deserve this honorary title look at them with no less pain! <br><br>  In general, you need to be very careful about the issue of gamification. <br><br>  I did not specifically talk about material goods, I wrote about this in a previous note.  But the main thing that I wanted to convey with this article is that everyone should understand for himself what is a real motivator for him.  And then work will become more fun and enjoyable! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185050/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185050/</a></p>
