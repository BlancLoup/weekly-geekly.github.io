  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I want to program, let them teach me! Avito educational projects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Hello!  My name is Anna, I am the head of educational projects in Avito.  It seems to us very important to encourage beginners (and not only) developers to learn about the coolest technologies on the market.  Therefore, we are doing a whole pool of educational online projects in partnership with the best sites.  I tell about them in detail under the cut, in the same place I reveal our plans for the future. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jo/4x/j1/jo4xj1h_fyeozvtaewlx9y-97_8.jpeg"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="sovmestnye-proekty-avito-s-veduschimi-onlayn-ploschadkami">  Avito collaborative projects with leading online sites </h1><br><p>  Learning should be fun and convenient.  The higher education system does not always keep pace with rapidly developing technologies (but still provides an excellent base), and streaming lectures and one and a half hour handwriting, like a few centuries ago, do not seem to be the most optimal ways of learning information. </p><br><p>  So far, no one has invented chips with knowledge, embedded directly into the brain, we will use proven training tools.  This year we have done as many as five projects with leading online educational sites (OTUS, LoftSchool, Stepik, GeekBrains, HTML Academy), in which we experiment on the format - we interview the best students, we edit the curriculum taking into account the technologies of the company's development, we pay for training in the case of employment at Avito, our employees become teachers and mentors of courses and much more.  This is what our partners tell about these projects. </p><br><h3 id="otus">  Otus </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zu/ry/zp/zuryzpiwucflb6uuswo_e2-vedm.png" alt="image" align="left">  <strong>Dmitry Voloshin, co-founder of OTUS:</strong> ‚ÄúThe <a href="https://goo.gl/pgU16J">OTUS</a> project is an educational course for professionals.  Unlike many, we do not teach ‚Äúprogramming from scratch,‚Äù our goal is to improve the level of IT developers. <br>  As part of our cooperation with Avito, the leading specialists of the company, together with OTUS teachers, have developed and refined the following training programs: <a href="https://goo.gl/qfovbq">Python</a> <a href="https://goo.gl/Hsthur">Developer, BigData Developer</a> , <a href="https://goo.gl/vX9QrP">Backend Developer in PHP</a> .  The best graduates of these programs will receive full reimbursement of tuition fees from Avito when they are employed by the company within three months after completing the courses. ‚Äù <br><br clear="left"></p><br><h3 id="loftschool">  Loftschool </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lk/m8/ma/lkm8mazeeeboi3_k6_-yghlkzbq.png" alt="image" align="left">  <strong>Tanya Artemyeva, coordinator of educational programs at <a href="https://goo.gl/GKNLfQ">LoftSchool</a> :</strong> ‚ÄúThe main teacher on the LoftSchool course‚Äú <a href="https://goo.gl/k278Uf">Comprehensive JavaScript Training</a> ‚Äùfor several years has been Sergey Melyukov, frontend developer of Avito.  This year we went beyond the previous collaboration with Avito: now the best graduates of the course ‚ÄúComprehensive JavaScript Training‚Äù and ‚Äú <a href="https://goo.gl/PFYwdJ">Advanced Web Development Course</a> ‚Äù will have the opportunity to have an interview and start a career in a large company immediately after the training.  It is also nice to know that Avito is open to different types of cooperation and communications: training webinars, additional bonuses, joint events.  Most recently, we had an excursion to the Avito office for our graduates.  This helps motivate new developers and gives them new goals and opportunities for development. ‚Äù <br><br clear="left"></p><br><h3 id="stepik">  Stepik </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qs/q2/t-/qsq2t-gckoft4wmoqlmujhc3-kw.png" alt="image" align="left">  <strong>Nikolay Vyakhkhi, founder of <a href="https://goo.gl/hX9DqD">Stepik</a> :</strong> ‚ÄúIn teaching technical disciplines, it is very important to apply the knowledge gained in practice.  Therefore, online courses that are created by specialists of IT companies are so useful and in demand among students. <br>  And for companies, the creation of such courses is an effective way to tell students both about themselves and about the skills that their professions should possess.  It is also a good tool for selecting interested graduates for internships, vacancies.  Of course, the creation of <a href="https://goo.gl/9gohjr">MOOC</a> is a time consuming process.  We hope for the imminent announcement of the first course from Avito to Stepik. ‚Äù <br>  <em>(Note. Ed .: By the way, it will be about the development on iOS).</em> <br><br clear="left"></p><br><h3 id="geekbrains">  Geekbrains </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sy/bj/xq/sybjxqof4shfpuvly9sy3mmdgso.png" alt="image" align="left">  <strong>Lyubov Pospelova, head of <a href="https://goo.gl/gYNj8S">GeekUniversity</a> :</strong> ‚ÄúTogether with partners from the IT industry, we create electives to acquaint students with the specifics of development in leading companies, as well as to connect potential employers and candidates.  This is an excellent student experience and opportunity for the company.  Avito was the first of our partners interested in this opportunity - and we got an interesting result.  GeekBrains iOS development faculty students will learn CoreData frameworks from Avito practitioners in January 2018. ‚Äù <br><br clear="left"></p><br><h3 id="html-academy">  HTML Academy </h3><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u6/69/rd/u669rdt_qs6dvuutnycn7mkssec.png" alt="image" align="left">  <strong>Alexey Simonenko, <a href="https://goo.gl/ghJRqf">HTML Academy</a> Development Director:</strong> ‚ÄúEven before meeting our colleagues from Avito, we worked together, but in absentia.  Employees of the company participate in the intensives as mentors, and our graduates work in Avito.  Our approach to education is not similar to other schools: the emphasis is primarily on fundamental knowledge, and only secondly on tools.  It's great that colleagues from Avito share our principles. <br>  Now we are specifying joint plans for the training and employment of front-end and backend developers.  And in general, we plan to develop the industry together.  I am inspired by this cooperation and I hope that we will be able to give the graduates of the Academy a dream job at Avito. ‚Äù <br><br clear="left"></p><br><h1 id="a-chto-zhe-dalshe">  And what next? </h1><br><p>  We regularly hold and support: </p><br><ul><li>  championships (for example, <a href="https://goo.gl/4X4fLj">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://goo.gl/aryqP7">Machine Learning</a> ); </li><li>  hackathons; </li><li>  thematic meetings with students and study tours with schoolchildren. </li></ul><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">See how it happens.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RR7iwTBNJU0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div></div><br><p>  In the spring of 2018, we are launching <b>IT internships</b> at Avito's Moscow office!  We will post more detailed information and test tasks as soon as they are ready, follow the publications here and in our social networks. <br>  By the way, if you are working in an educational project or organization, and it seems to you that we urgently need to come up with a joint project, please write me about it. </p><br><p>  Good luck to you and cool technology! </p></div>
