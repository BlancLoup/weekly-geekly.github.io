The main sensation was the victory of our team from their <a href="http://brainy.pro/">Periny Brainy Studio</a> in the category of game projects.  Read more about how it was - read under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ea/e16/65e/9eae1665eac34148ad9fd321480bda25.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The game that the guys submitted to the contest is called TurnOn (by the way, you can <a href="http://brainy.pro/turnon_en">play it on the site</a> , or <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/turnon-demo/981af9d4-32d1-42be-a848-d5075e9ff8a3">download the version of the application for Windows Phone</a> ).  In this game you need to travel around a dark city, returning the light to it - at the same time, the atmosphere of the game is unique and wonderful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a33/5da/8e5/a335da8e5864422ca662666cea7d79eb.PNG">

      The team is participating in competitions for the third year already; last year they <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rustudents/archive/2013/04/15/imagine-cup-2013-russian-finals.aspx">took second place</a> in the Russian final with <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/witchcraft-rus/b2480dd9-8691-482d-86b9-57c5abc44b18">Witchcraft</a> .  And this year their perseverance was crowned with success - the team brought Russia <a href="https://www.imaginecup.com/Blog/Details/winners-of-the-2014-imagine-cup-world-finals">first place in the games category</a> !  In the photo above, the prize to our team is presented by the creator of Tetris - <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9_%25D0%259B%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Alexey Pajitnov</a> . <br><br>  To achieve victory, the team had to go through two difficult stages of the struggle - a speech before the jury members, as well as personal demo sessions and conversations with each of the jury members separately.  However, our team had a surprise - in addition to just a wonderful game (in the new 2.5D-henger genre) they first realized 2.5D game on the Oculus Rift 3D glasses, and also for the first time in Russia made a three-dimensional virtual reality game on Windows Phone, available to everyone with a homemade helmet, released as Open Hardware, which can be printed on a 3D printer.  About the relevant technology <a href="http://www.techdays.ru/videos/7660.html">previously told Alexander Bragin</a> at the conference DevCon 2014. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc7/69e/604/bc769e60446c441e8dca1f338449d467.png"><br><br>  As a result, our guys received not only the main prize of $ 50,000, a <a href="https://www.imaginecup.com/Custom/Index/BootCamps">trip to the</a> <a href="http://www.paxsite.com/">PAX</a> <a href="https://www.imaginecup.com/Custom/Index/BootCamps">conference</a> - but also won the <a href="https://www.imaginecup.com/Competition/16190">AppCampus Award</a> , which will allow them to spend another 20,000 euros to develop their game.  We hope this will allow us to get another great game from Russia that will shake the world! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48c/370/4e0/48c3704e0c55493bbbb5313c737586de.png"><br><br>  In addition to the award ceremony, on the final day on the stage (see picture above), a competition was held live between the winners in each category for the right to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rustudents/archive/2014/02/27/unique-chance-to-meet-bill-gates-for-imagine-cup-participants.aspx">present their project to Bill Gates</a> .  For 90 seconds, the teams had to answer the questions of the jury on three topics: dream it, build it, live it.  The jury was Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft), Hadi Partovi (founder of <a href="http://code.org/">Code.org</a> and Erik Martin (GM Reddit). Of the three projects, the most social was chosen ‚Äî a program created by two medical students from Australia that allows you to diagnose anemia based on a snapshot from a mobile phone (with a special color calibration strip). <br><br>  Of course, these days the guys saw a lot and learned a lot.  But the final most pleasant touch was the air tour over Seattle and Redmond, organized specially for our team by <a href="http://www.viacode.com/">VIAcode</a> .  For about an hour, the guys inspected the local sights from a bird's-eye view, and even could manage themselves by plane! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47a/58f/4bf/47a58f4bfd34487c8324d4ab4e47a82b.jpg"><br><br>  You can read about other winners in games and other categories <a href="https://www.imaginecup.com/Content/Details/17391">on the official website of the competitions</a> , and the report of our guys about the competitions is <a href="https://twitter.com/brainy_studio">on their twitter</a> .  And of course you watch TV, read newspapers - in the near future you will see a lot of news about Imagine Cup there! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a6/3ed/b79/9a63edb79fdd41649e590ab7c112ac5f.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/232183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/232183/</a></p>
