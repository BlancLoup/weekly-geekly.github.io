  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of three super-bright LED headlamps</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.princetontec.com/">Princeton Tec</a> has been producing and selling tourist lanterns for 30 years.  In 2005, Princeton Tec began the production of several slightly modified headlights for cycling.  These models had fastenings that allowed attaching them to the helmet as well.  Nevertheless, these first models did not become popular since they were designed for hiking and were completely unsuitable for cyclists, often accelerating to 20 Km / h and higher. By 2007, Princeton Tec had prepared several completely new, specialized bicycle headlights.  This line also includes the ‚ÄúSwitchback‚Äù series headlights.  Switchback is a revived series in which headlamps with incandescent lamps were previously produced. <a name="habracut"></a>  The development of the Switchback series was carried out with the involvement of professional cyclists, so it was reasonable to expect good performance from these lamps.  I am not a fan of driving at night, nevertheless I will express my opinion on the use of these lamps in real life based on my year-round riding experience.  <b>Features of the Switchback range:</b> The Princeton Tec Switchback is available in three models: Switchback 1 with one 3 watt LED, Switchback 2 with two 3 watt LEDs, and Switchback 3 with (as you might guess) three 3 watt LEDs.  Each of these headlights has a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù charger with a universal plug, a lightweight lithium-ion battery, an effective luminance brightness control chip, a car charger, helm and helm accessories, and all the necessary wires.  <b>Individual characteristics of each model:</b> <table cellspacing="5"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Model</b> </td><td>  <b>Glow time</b> </td><td>  <b>Weight</b> </td><td>  <b>US price</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  <nobr>Switchback 1</nobr> </td><td>  5.5 h Flash, 4.5 h High, 6 h Medium, 10 h Low </td><td>  436 grams </td><td>  199 USD </td></tr><tr><td>  <nobr>Switchback 2</nobr> </td><td>  6 h Flash, 5.5 h High, 7 h Medium, 16 h Low </td><td>  586 grams </td><td>  269 ‚Äã‚ÄãUSD </td></tr><tr><td>  <nobr>Switchback 3</nobr> </td><td>  6.5 h Flash, 6 h High, 12 h Medium, 50 h Low </td><td>  826 grams </td><td>  389 USD </td></tr></tbody></table> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bike/329756186/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c99/9ce/411/c999ce411a10a6dcdbefa079cce2443f.jpg" width="240" height="180" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/bike/329756188/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/97a/744/cd5/97a744cd5eb51ee6274aa2dc16c2b568.jpg" width="240" height="180" hspace="10" vspace="10"></a>  <b>Using Switchback 2</b> I tried two Switchback 2 headlights. Unfortunately, it was not possible to use special measuring equipment, but I can say with absolute certainty that the headlamp on two superbright three-way LEDs corresponds in its power to a halogen headlight with 10 + 20 watt lamps.  The focusing of the lenses is good and the light spot is close to perfect.  The range of the two-LED headlamp at maximum power allowed me quite comfortably and safely to drive along the night highway at a speed of about 32 km / h. The flashing mode is also interesting and convenient.  Most LED headlights have a flashing mode to save batteries and increase the range from which the driver will notice the cyclist.  But to determine the distance from the flashing signal is extremely difficult.  The switchback flashes twice, then lights up for a second and starts flashing again.  I have not had a chance to use this mode, but I think that such an algorithm will allow motorists to notice me further and at the same time you can determine the distance to the bike. The battery has a built-in charge indicator - red and green LEDs warn about the charge level. <br>  Design lights successful.  The body is light and smooth, which is significantly better than most other previously tested headlights.  Steering mount somewhat massive, but I liked the design, use a lamp is quite convenient.  If you need to remove the lamp, it can be done very quickly and simply.  If you need to change the focus of the light spot, this can also be done using a common key. The battery is securely fastened with a special velcro under the top beam or is stored in a backpack if you have installed the headlamp on the helmet.  The bundled electrical cord is long enough for convenient battery installation.  <b>Conclusion:</b> You can't say that Switchback 2 is absolutely enough for night competitions, but for cycling at night it is more than enough.  <b>Sources:</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.cyclelicio.us/2006/12/product-review-2007-princeton-tec.html">Fritz @ www.cyclelicio.us</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.gearreview.com/2007_led_lights.php">www.gearreview.com</a> </div>
