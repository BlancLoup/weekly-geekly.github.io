    <h4>  The most important </h4><br>  The game designer is not taught. <br>  This specialty does not officially exist and there are no diplomas (at universities, for now, if you have information about this, share in the comments) <br>  Yes, there are many courses, but they will be useful or not, and most importantly, at what stage they are needed. <br><br>  Before reading the article, I recommend to <a href="https://habr.com/post/430276/">get acquainted with this material.</a> <br><br>  So, you still decided to go along the thorny path of a game designer, you have 2 options <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7o/s4/po/7os4poy4vx660jqod0lloynnbsg.png"><br><br><h4>  Option I </h4><br>  Create your own mod (addition) for your favorite game.  There are many mods for HL 2 and Unreal that have grown into full-fledged games.  The main thing is to create a new gaming experience based on the materials. <br><br>  <b>What you can enter:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  New storyline </li><li>  Change balance </li><li>  New opponents </li><li>  Create new locations </li><li>  Make a new game using the utility for building </li><li>  Do all of the above </li></ul><br>  This is a good option to try yourself as a game designer.  Record a video overview on your mod and put it in open access, the mod itself too.  Collect feedback from the audience, correct if you wish. <br><br>  Congratulations, you can now try your hand at the position of the juna while having a portfolio.  <u>(mod of course should be cool)</u> <br><br>  <i>Author's notes *</i> <br><blockquote>  Not my path, I was doing this in 2003 - 2007, I grew up or was just not interested.  But for the vast majority of people - an excellent choice. </blockquote><br><h4>  Option II </h4><br>  <b>but)</b> <br>  Develop your game on Unity using the available assemblies without the involvement of a coder and artist. <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  suitable for singles </li><li>  you will recognize the engine and all its features </li><li>  collect a maximum of cones and be ready to train newcomers whom you will recruit to your team (if you will) </li><li>  you will become a strong generalist and you will be able to find what you are interested in. </li><li>  You will see your capabilities and the quality of your work. </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  long and harder option b (although someone like) </li><li>  no one will tell and will not help, you will not be able to delegate some things </li><li>  no one to consult with (the majority of those around are ‚Äúoff topic‚Äù) </li></ul><br>  <b>b)</b> <br><br>  Assemble a team of 3 people (game designer + artist + coder), or find a person who is strong in what you are weak in. (You are an artist, he is a coder and vice versa) <br><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  you will learn how to work in a team </li><li>  you have like-minded people and you are responsible to each other. </li><li>  you can concentrate on your strength </li><li>  2 heads are always better, most problems are solved by themselves </li><li>  if you are a good team, then it is easier for you to attract new people and train them </li><li>  your advertising budget (if any) is higher </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  hard to find the right people </li><li>  need to be able / want to work with people </li><li>  it is important to clearly structure the information on the game (I love the bard and it's hard for me) </li><li>  it is necessary to arrange the documents in order to avoid conflicts </li><li>  you may come across a cheater </li></ul><br>  <i>Author's notes *</i> <br><blockquote>  My choice, because the work of a game designer is to bring the idea to the team.  Otherwise, what kind of development can we talk about?  This is a good way for ambitious developers, the main thing is not to give up. </blockquote>  <b>Okay.</b>  The first way is more suitable for children up to 15-17 years old, the second one for students ... ok, <b>you are a serious uncle, what to do?</b> <br><br>  If you are already in the industry, then everything is much simpler, learn how to make DG and push the speeches, and better Lift Talk <i>(separate material will be on this topic)</i> and try, drown, do not give up and everything will work out. <br><br>  <b>And if not‚Ä¶</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hp/gk/gb/hpgkgbdigc23qc1uhofw-v21gi0.png"><br><br>  Suppose you have a few hours after work.  Then you need a clear algorithm and a set of rules. <br><br>  <b>Namely:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Identify your strengths </li><li>  Create a DG document </li><li>  Decide to make a project alone or with a team. </li><li>  Assemble the team and show her the State Duma </li><li>  Make a game prototype ( <a href="https://habr.com/post/430276/">here's a good article about it</a> ) </li><li>  Make an adjustment </li><li>  Test inside the team (correction if needed) </li><li>  Open beta </li><li>  Release </li><li>  Make 2-3 simple projects in such a way, your genre - arcades, hyper casual, casual </li></ul><br><h4>  Rules: </h4><br><ul><li>  Prepare documents for the team </li><li>  Do not tear the fifth point (why? Do not rush, you have a job, is there?) </li><li>  Do not make protracted (you can not afford it, you have no guarantees that the game will appeal to the public) </li><li>  Choose your target audience and niche </li><li>  Quickly make a prototype </li><li>  Buy low-cost assets to reduce development time. </li><li>  Choose a simple engine with a bunch of lessons (file or anrial) </li></ul><br><h4>  Tasks: </h4><br><ul><li>  Understand if you have the potential (adequate) </li><li>  Launch portfolio projects </li><li>  Get income from simple projects, perhaps this will be enough to engage in game-dev all the time. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g0/f8/l3/g0f8l3opkcrxgtlddbxznhawvoa.png"><br><br>  <b>Never ...</b> <br><br><ul><li>  make unfinished first project </li><li>  be overly confident </li><li>  neglect statistics and marketing data </li><li>  think you are the smartest </li><li>  make clones </li><li>  do extra work if you have an asset with what you need, buy </li><li>  make samopisnyh engines (I'm serious) </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5y/gp/yh/5ygpyhqfilxwfmz8jucxochkxyi.png"><br><br><h4>  Notes </h4><br><blockquote>  Protracted kill fuse, team and idea.  After 3 years, you do not remember what you did.  Need experience to work with such projects. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  There are exceptions to all the rules, believe me, these people do not read, they do and devote all the time to development. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  We are mere mortals and not geniuses, there are exceptions, but in most cases it is enough to follow simple rules, consistency and correct calculation to achieve good results. </blockquote><br><h4>  From the author </h4><br><br>  Now I supervise 4 projects, 3 of them are mine.  For 3 years of work in game dev I didn‚Äôt release finished projects made entirely according to my idea.  Therefore, I can not call their own. <br><br><ul><li>  If the idea came from a CEO, this is not my game. </li><li>  If the idea is ready, and it needs to be improved, this is not my game. </li><li>  If you need to update / patch and rebalance, this is not my game. </li></ul><br><br>  My game is what I invented myself, from the idea, the setting, to the music, art, mechanics, behavior patterns of opponents, and so on.  Yes, I did not deal with the code, this is done by my partner.  I say how it should work and look, so I do not think that he can consider this game his 100%. <br><br>  <b>I am stubborn and I think so.</b>  Therefore, I often come across situations where I have nothing to show with enough experience.  But it is enough to look at me in action and see what I am standing for. <br><br>  <b>Do not make this mistake, collect a portfolio, even from simple projects, but you will have something to show and it will be in the release.</b> <br><br>  ALL projects in which I play the role of game designer (and I can call them with my ideas) at the PTA / Prototype stage, this is my big mistake.  I will tell about them a bit later, when entering the MBT stage. <br><br>  Now you can ‚Äútouch‚Äù a 2D RPG on an android, start 2 wave, if you want to write in the LAN. <br>  You can also fill out a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14QWKYI_eVPs8PQWAVHeGQXk85JN4gizvoHs7PTwfhCY/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">Google form</a> or write to us at <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">mail</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  psgameinside@gmail.com <br></div></div><br><br>  Today I started developing a simple game in the arcade genre, while this is only a game design document and a set of references, I will dedicate a separate article to this, the main thing is to start working on my mistakes. <br><br>  <b>Be smarter, learn from the mistakes of others.</b>  <b>Set goals and achieve them.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/my/i5/6s/myi56stzvmdvjjhi1oqzcbe54x4.jpeg"><br><br>  In the following material we will examine the question: <br>  What is the work of a game designer, why is it needed? <br><br>  Thanks for reading! <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  I want to believe that the article gave you a charge of vigor and determination for the week ahead. <br><br><h4>  More materials from the author: </h4><br>  Part 1 <a href="https://habr.com/post/429406/">"Monsters in games or how to create fear"</a> <br>  Part 2 <a href="https://habr.com/post/429630/">"Monsters in games or make fear diverse"</a> <br>  Part 3 <a href="https://habr.com/post/429860/">"Monsters in games or how to surprise a player"</a> <br>  Part 4 <a href="https://habr.com/post/430272/">"Monsters in games or 15 cm is enough to attack"</a> <br>  Part 5 <a href="https://habr.com/post/430862/">"Monsters in games - how to make a player hate you"</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/430276/">The ruinous mistake of newbies in game dev</a> <br>  <a href="https://habr.com/post/430454/">I'm surrounded by idiots or how to work in a team</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430984/</a></p>
