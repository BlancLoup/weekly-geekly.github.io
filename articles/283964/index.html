  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Applications for remotely working teams</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now the work of the designer is a fascinating occupation.  Virtually unlimited connectivity allows designers and firms to work together without the need to share a common space.  Many designers and employees of the web industry love mobility, and, to their happiness, more and more companies, especially startups, are beginning to use remote work. <br><br>  When working outside the office environment, it is hard to force yourself to focus on the task and keep to the deadlines for submitting projects even for more pragmatic creative individuals.  However, both companies and employees tend to follow the progress of the process and communicate effectively on a daily basis.  Also important is the requirement that people can work as a team, even if they are hundreds of miles apart. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  These needs have led to the creation over the past few years of a number of useful programs and applications.  Being on the one hand social networks, and on the other - project management software, these applications allow all project participants to easily and without problems communicate and work together regardless of where each participant is physically located.  No matter who you are - the owner of a company that is trying to track and improve internal productivity, or an employee who is trying to remain ready for any surprise, a mobile corporate application will be the best solution. <br><br>  <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>

      If you are looking for a good project management tool, Trello is an excellent choice that allows everyone to create Trello Cards that can be assigned to groups or individuals. <br><br>  Trello also uses the principle of queues, so that you can monitor the project from concept to completion.  The application is easy to use, a significant emphasis is placed on the design, which provides ease of use.  The Trello mobile app is one of the most intuitive ones we have come across, and provides easy switching from PC to mobile devices. <br><br>  UPD: Chrome <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plus-for-trello-time-trac/gjjpophepkbhejnglcmkdnncmaanojkf%3Futm_source%3Dchrome-app-launcher-info-dialog">plugin</a> allows you to build reports on projects in Trello.  Thanks <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/teutonick/" class="user_link">Teutonick</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://getsigneasy.com/">SignEasy</a> <br><br>  The application intended for signing documents, most likely, according to the designer, is not among the first, which can speed up the workflow, but it is extremely useful for employees working abroad or for freelancers. <br><br>  SignEasy is mobile cloud-based software that allows customers, employees and senior management to sign documents wherever they are.  This allows you to eliminate the delays associated with mailing documents - or clutter associated with an attempt to find a fax machine somewhere today. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.syncplicity.com/">Syncplicity</a> <br><br>  At first glance, it becomes clear that the design team that created the Syncplicity file-sharing and management application, put user interaction experience first.  With the Syncplicity interface, presented in the form of a stack of sheets, it is easy to manage any files from your phone or tablet. <br><br>  The application allows you to easily and securely send and share documents, as well as access them from any device without any difficulties.  When your team is working on a large project with a lot of files that need to be loaded and unloaded quickly and easily, Syncplicity is an excellent choice. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.sapience.net/">Sapience</a> <br><br>  Sapience represents a corporate ‚Äúreminder‚Äù application that allows you to efficiently use time, providing the opportunity to maximize working efficiency with both employees in the workplace and remote workers. <br><br>  The application analyzes the use of your smartphone and gives you clear visual information about the use of time during the day.  It allows you to easily and naturally mark phone calls, use applications and navigate during the working day.  Sapience helps both individuals and companies see where most of their work time has been spent, so that they can plan and reallocate their budget accordingly. <br><br>  <a href="https://evernote.com/intl/ru/">Evernote</a> <br><br>  From the computer to the smartphone, Evernote allows you to ensure the smoothness of the workflow from preliminary sketches to its completion, and even before the presentation.  In fact, this is something like a superhero notepad. <br><br>  It allows you to save ideas, gleaned from the network, magazines, also allows you to take notes and work with full-scale projects - all on one platform.  In addition, it is an excellent organizational tool.  If you are working on several creative projects at the same time, Evernote will be one of your ‚Äúdesktop applications‚Äù for tracking progress. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Useful Paysto solutions for Megamind readers:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚Üí <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/email">Get paid by credit card right now.</a>  <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/email">Without a site, PI and LLC.</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/">Accept payments from companies via the Internet.</a>  <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/">Without a site, PI and LLC.</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/api">Acceptance of payments from companies for your site.</a>  <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/api">With document flow and exchange of originals.</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/automat">Automation of sales and service transactions with legal entities.</a>  <a href="http://linkcharge.ru/automat">Without intermediary in the calculations.</a> <br><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/283964/">https://habr.com/ru/post/283964/</a></p>
