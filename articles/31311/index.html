  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Silent agreement</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Imagine that your child is playing pranks right in front of your eyes while you are silent.  Or imagine that you control people at work and notice that one of your subordinates makes a serious mistake, and you do not lift a finger to point him or her at that.  This is tacit consent. <br><br>  It is clear that when using tacit consent to reinforce the negative results of other people's actions, problems arise.  But even worse, if you use tacit consent towards yourself. <br><br>  Which of the problems in life do you often encounter, and, instead of consciously working with them, turn away from them?  Maybe you have a low level of energy due to the fact that you did not exercise and ate poorly.  Perhaps your relationship with your family is not what you would like.  Maybe your career is crashing down.  When you use tacit consent towards yourself, you tell your subconscious that your current performance standards are perfectly acceptable.  Well, don‚Äôt be surprised if you keep getting the same results year after year. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you want to change the results that you get - you can not use tacit consent.  You must set new standards for yourself.  And when you notice that your new standards are being violated, you have to bring this into awareness.  Tear up your old tacit consent pattern - noisy disagreement!  If you catch yourself eating too much, say loudly: ‚ÄúYou pig!  What the hell are you doing? "Or, if it's not your style, then try a softer approach, like" It's not mine.  I know a lesson better than that.  I'd better go, take a walk. ‚Äù  Instead of remaining silent - speak out loud.  Let your disapproval be heard loud and clear.  Let your subconscious know that you need his help in finding another way to satisfy your needs, for the current approach is completely wrong.

      Tacit consent is one of the best friends of fear.  Tacit consent is a way for a coward to hide from the truth.  Sometimes it is painful to face the truth.  This is normal.  With a slight pain that arises from time to time, you can cope.  Just do not go away from awareness. <br><br>  Tacit acceptance makes solving your problems impossible.  You cannot solve a problem that you refuse to acknowledge.  And anyway, what level is it - personal, family, team, corporate or global.  If you want to solve it - you must first pull it into the light of conscious knowledge, and with blows and shouts, if necessary.  Then you will finally have a chance to solve it.  And even if such problems cannot be resolved, there will be at least an opportunity to accept them.  Conscious acceptance is always better than tacit consent. <br><br>  Original: <a href="http://www.steve-pavlina.ru/">Self-development for smart people</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31311/</a></p>
