We consulted with the customer of one of the projects I developed and decided to move from Masterhost to FastVps.  We chose the tariff, made an order for a month, decided to pay. <br><br>  In proximity with the customer was located only payment <a href="http://www.oneplat.ru/">"Orange"</a> .  Payment was made to my Webmoney R-purse.  Actually waiting for the transfer, because usually the money reaches within 10-30 minutes.  But not at this time‚Ä¶

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The situation was such that an hour passes ‚Äî there is no money.  It takes two hours - there is still no money.  A day has passed - there is still no money. <br>  Patience was not enough, they made a call to the support service indicated on the check. <br>  The dear young lady replied, something like this: ‚Äúsome problems, yesterday‚Äôs payments have just arrived today‚Äù.  They say wait.  Well, where did ours not disappear?  We are waiting further, until the end of the hosting period on the master remains 2 days.  '' We will have time to move '' - I think. <br><br><h5>  The clock went on ... The night passed ... </h5><br><br>  The next morning, again, the money did not come.  Dinner time - we decided to make another call.  The dear young lady again replies that: ‚Äúthey put in a queue for shipment (and yesterday you forgive what you did?), Call a little later in the evening if you do not come.‚Äù  Patience is still enough - so we are waiting. <br><br><h5>  Evening was coming </h5><br><br>  Checking the bill - Alas.  Make a second call (the third is obtained). <br><br>  <s>A nice</s> young lady says: ‚Äúmoney was returned from the web by money, they said no your phone number‚Äù.  Yes, it happens, when you pay for webmoney, the device asks you to specify the same mobile phone number, <b>BUT</b> if you pay, there was not even a hint of it.  Brad we think!  We inform the phone - "we have redirected your phone number" - said the interlocutor. <br><br>  Before shutdown of a hosting there are days.  I backup files, muscle backup.  We live! <br><br>  On the phone, the cameraman also said that "we have all the payments stuck."  Did a flash mob take place and ten million people put the money in exactly 1 minute? <br><br><h5>  Another night has passed </h5><br><br>  Before the hosting is turned off, it remains less than 12 hours, the nerves are at the limit. <br><br>  We call.  The girl said that: "Payments are in line, yesterday they redirected your phone, there is no response from the web yet."  Your division, but the pigeons will fly faster and transmit this information.  We call another hotline number, we inform you that the money has been going for 3 days and we are sorry, but there is no time to wait.  A woman / girl / young lady reports that everything is clear, now we will decide, "maybe denyuzhku will come to you within 15-20 minutes". <br><br>  It takes half an hour - no money, hosting turned off.  On the main page of the site there is an inscription - <i>Server does not exist ... bla bla bla</i> . <br><br>  Feet in hand - I quickly create a stub, transfer the domain to a friend for hosting, copy the stub files - 15 minutes and the stub is already spinning. <br><br>  The site is still news, journalists are in hysterics, one of which, in order to get credits, must show their articles to the teacher, as reports - otherwise he will be kicked out. <br><br>  <b>Indicated Habravchane what advise you to do?</b>  <b>Is it possible to return the money?</b>  <b>Are there any deadlines after which the payment system must return the money?</b> <br><br>  Thank you in advance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77872/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77872/</a></p>
