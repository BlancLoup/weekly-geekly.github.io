As part of this process, I will try to talk about the impact of IT disciplines on social roles and the global position of video education in the world, presenting it in the way my personal thought process worked - in the form of answers to some questions.  I hope that this article will seem entertaining to you, and to someone, perhaps even proves useful. <br><br>  Namely: <br><br>  What is common in self-construction and education in IT?

      What is education in general? <br><br>  and <br><br>  What is video training? <br><br>  *** <br><br>  This is a story about how properly organized video programming lessons have done what neither me, nor my family and friends have been able to do over the years, setting an excellent motivation for the activities that I do now.  This morning, the team of which I am, has opened a new video learning portal. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact is that when I went through the video training, I got rid of many moments that hindered my development and devastated my life, got rid of aggression and hyperactivity - factors preventing me from systematically and consistently learning, which was a real problem.  I wanted to study IT, but it was precisely the study of logic, OOP and work with algorithms that made it difficult.  And also the fact is that by applying the techniques realized now and considered in the article to real life, in 4 years I, in fact, made myself anew.  There is no pathos, it is just the application of the same PLO to real life and the use of a specific training system based on a deep understanding of the technologies taught and even the IT philosophy that makes people who work in this industry a kind of successful people caste due to the usual self-esteem and organization. <br><br>  You ask me - what have the video courses?  What gives them the opportunity to change themselves, and even gaining knowledge, not looking up from work?  In English, there is the word Selfmademan - This is a person who has decided to realize his life, based on the concept of working on himself to the desired vision of a person as a set of qualities.  Now imagine this list of qualities and actions leading to them, written in the form of a code.  So the practice of programming turns into a fascinatingly described own life.  Believe me, you can not tear myself away!  You can say - I will not succeed.  I will tell you - the trainer who reads the Boolean logic to you has succeeded.  I looked at him, listened and I did it too.  It turned out at the expense of consistency, proper presentation of the material, additional tasks for the lessons, and most importantly, clarity of the principles of programming, as it turned out, easily applicable to real life. <br><br>  Having made this revolution in consciousness, I thought a lot about what had happened, applying my reflections in the creation of the IT Video Developers Network.  I became an IT specialist, because I didn‚Äôt change anything, but my character, and it seems to me that this made me a successful person.  I worked on the complex tasks of my life, applying logic and programming models to the disciplinary approaches, taken from the video lessons that make up the video courses that I took.  But this is not enough to understand exactly how such changes occurred in my personality.  Then I realized that I need to understand what video training really is.  And I decided to dig a story :) <br><br>  In order for us to better understand the subject of our conversation, let's move to the year 1840, where a young teacher, Isaac Pitman, teaches students in the United Kingdom, while he spends his days at the post office, with the help of which he gives tasks and accepts control ones.  It was a distance learning.  It was innovative and bold, but still it was not an isolated case.  So they did in the USA, where Anna Eliot Tiknor even tried to open a society ‚ÄúTraining by mail for women‚Äù calling her by its name and in England they tried.  And therefore, it would be a mistake to call Pitman a pioneer in distance learning.  William Raine Harper is more suitable for this role. In 1892 he acted as the founder of the department of distance education by mail, opened at the University of Chicago.  And since the University of Chicago at that time meant something, the world finally noticed that it was ‚ÄúDamn it, it‚Äôs extremely convenient!‚Äù That this is exactly what allows people to be educated even in the most remote parts of the country, and indeed You can learn, not really looking up from work. <br><br>  In 1939, distance learning, distance learning, the beginnings of a consulting model developed in the USSR appeared.  In the same year, the ‚ÄúState Center for Distance Learning of Children‚Äù opened in France, which today is positioned as the largest center for the development and practice of distance education techniques in the European Union.  All these events were very dynamic, against the background of revolutions and coups, the Cold War and local military operations.  The world fought, argued, extracted resources, but it never stopped learning.  The pace of development of remote and innovative, technological training was close to the pace of the Soviet space program.  This makes us think that not so much stress as understanding that the absence of stress is a blessing leads to the value of the learning process for the learner.  For example, already in the 60s of the 20th century, the Soviets opened more than 11 correspondence universities and Western countries began to copy the model of education adopted in the USSR.  But, we admit, not so much the guys from the United States succeeded, just like we have now copied their training models, which rarely take root in our mentality.  And why?  But because the states are on the rise and there are no stresses, they do not really study and need to.  That is why the Americans at that time do not shine with knowledge.  In 1969, a branch of the Open University in the UK was opened, which leads to the fact that educational institutions with distance and correspondence forms of education appear in Spain, Pakistan, and India.  A trend is being created to study even outside the place to study.  It divides the world into more successful, successful and ... less) <br>  And so, in 1979, communist China changed the world of education radically.  A nationwide network of radio and television universities is opening across the country.  And that meant that the new time is here!  What is the time of successful - those who have time.  She has time to work and learns and lives in the breaks :) The era of training video comes and it will play a role of considerable importance in the new millennium.  Now you can watch a lecture and be at a lecture without leaving your home.  It was a breakthrough - a revolution in education and what about people?  People, as always, have not noticed.  A lot of time passed before people said to themselves that - ‚ÄúThis, damn it, is not only convenient, but also pleasant!‚Äù <br><br>  So we returned to our time and it became clear that the video education system for programming has surprises that you will not learn until you encounter video training as a necessity.  See, it's cheaper!  It's simple and comfortable - obviously, because you are essentially watching a movie.  Moreover, you can repeat!  You can repeat and repeat, and at any time return to incomprehensible moments.  You can use the service "Consultation with a trainer" - this service provides the portal of video training and training services in the project that I and the team of like-minded people have been working on for the last 4 months, trying to facilitate access of ordinary people to video courses on C # and Microsoft .  And finally, the system of remote training video, like no other, will show you how much you have become lazy and slow and feel more than pride when it will save you from this by your own efforts.  Video training is effective because it is not only programming training, but also time management training, sequence and responsibility combined. <br><br>  We are all confronted with what is called the discrepancy between the digital era and this is partly due to the fact that we are people of post-Soviet education.  However, with all the love of childhood, the memories of youth and the logic of economics invested in each of us without a world market, it must be admitted that the Soviet educational system turned out to be as ineffective as the internal planned economy that buried the USSR.  And these reflections lead us to the fact that video training, as a phenomenon, also solves such problems as the lack of incentives for effective work, double standards of the educational process and the lack of real hardcore testing, vital for everyone who decided to join the IT-professionals community.  This is a test of one‚Äôs own motivation, while if it is not just about watching video lessons, but about an educational process - thoughtful, systemic and supported by certified trainers, like in the model that we built and how I studied myself, then we can talk about following benefits: <br><br>  - video courses and video education in general provides a full-fledged training of specialists in IT, including in itself, both working with an initial level of knowledge, and with people with experience.  At the same time, there is neither age qualification nor typical social problems arising during group work; <br><br>  - The list of disciplines, technologies and areas is not only extensive, but also dynamic and is in a constant stage of addition to the catalog of video courses; <br><br>  - a wide range of teaching methods, support, certification, webinars and seminars, master classes, streaming radio, support in social media, communities of students. <br><br>  We will try to summarize: <br><br>  - So, what is common in self-construction and education in IT? <br><br>  Very simple.  In both cases, this is the logic of the process, the sequential and thoughtful pursuit of one's goal and the ability to realize and accept not only past, but also current, directly perceived experience.  Second question <br><br>  - What is education? <br><br>  It is also simple: Education is, in the opinion of many, the very main factor that contributes to social development and economic growth of the country.  Educated people - is the key to the prosperity of the state.  Developed countries have always maintained and strengthened their positions in the world market at the expense of qualified specialists and this was the motivation for the development and realization of the need for skilled labor.  That is why modern video education is fully capable of competing with full-time education, and in many ways surpasses it, because today this niche occupies one of the leading positions in the list of investment priorities, while attracting both public and private investments.  Video education is an excellent choice for people who do not rely on the university, which will give everything, while they themselves give themselves everything they want to be able to and realizing these skills get the opportunity to live a rich and independent life. <br><br>  - And finally.  What is video training? <br><br>  First of all, this is a much more specific and narrow concept than education, as such. <br>  And it's easy.  Video tutorials are new features!  This is a solution to the problem of the quality of the educational process and the formation of the individual, and not just professional growth.  Work in synchronous (video or audio with graphics submitted in conference mode) and in asynchronous mode (e-mail, Internet, newsgroups) are techniques that make it possible to significantly facilitate the interaction between a mentor and a student and turn the learning process into a game model, while maintaining comfort zone and independence in the choice of disciplines and the construction of particulars and specifics of the learning process.  Video lessons, video lectures and distance education, as a way of professional growth, are ways to provide education to those who want to learn, but do not have the opportunity to learn in the traditional form. <br><br>  Perhaps it was this thought that forced us to make on our service the possibility of free education for social groups experiencing problems in life that interfere with learning.  Perhaps this is what caused us to write links that almost drive us into minus.  Perhaps this is the very example of how we grew up morally while sawing this project.  Anyway, the project is alive and it was he who formed this, a personal opinion about the connection of video education and work on yourself. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208954/</a></p>
