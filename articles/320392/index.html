Still, it's great sometimes to get away from the hustle and bustle and calmly watch heels or two of selected videos, remember what was interesting last time and try to imagine what would happen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/619/67d/662/61967d6628844359aabfc87760f2358d.jpg"><br><br>  Today, we will turn to Mobius, a conference on mobile development (Android and iOS, mostly), and that's fine: the TOP included 5 reports on Android development and 3 on iOS.  Under the cat you will find reports on the possibilities of languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Swift, Kotlin), on testing, current frameworks and approaches, and even on development for Cardboard.

      Saying ‚Äútop‚Äù, we mean not our favorite reports or the choice of some ‚Äúexperts‚Äù - the best ones are selected based on a weighted score from 80% of the conference participants.  therefore <br>  even if you watched previously uploaded videos, see the rating.  Suddenly you missed the reports that were most appreciated by our participants? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>1 place, rating 4.68</b> <b><br></b>  <b>[iOS] Maxim Sokolov - Advanced Swift Generics - let's switch to &lt;T&gt;</b> <br><br>  A report on the intricacies of using generics in the Swift programming language: 5 people, 3 applications and 100 thousand lines of code.  The report begins with a demo, explaining why Swift and generics with associatedType is good and safe. <br><br>  Further, Maxim, on a living example, demonstrates how generics allow you to avoid the boilerplate code and type casting errors when working with tables using the example of the Table.swift framework. <br><br>  At the end of the report there is another demo.  In general, fun - see the report: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R6W3oytTw7U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>2 place, rating 4.50</b> <b><br></b>  <b>[Android] Cyril Popov - O <a href="https://github.com/facebook/fresco">Fresco</a> and how to prepare it, as well as pictures in Android in general</b> <br><br>  If you work a lot with images, it is likely that you have your favorite (or not) bike for this purpose.  Looking for a ready-made solution, the guys from Odnoklassniki looked at Picasso, Glide, Universal Image Loader and several other solutions, but in the end they chose Fresco.  Why?  See the answer in the report. <br><br>  Kirill tells both about features that became the decisive factor in choosing this framework, and about its minuses.  When working with Fresco, there were quite a few interesting pitfalls that the team had to decide or bypass. <br><br>  At the end of the report, Kirill talks about some non-standard approaches to the use of Fresco.  In addition, you will hear a few words about performance, downloading from the Internet and memory reuse. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Df9xvmtOD5I" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>3 place, rating 4.49</b> <b><br></b>  <b>[Android] Evgeny Matsyuk - We write the code under test</b> <br><br>  Did it happen that when you came to a new project, you suffered trying to figure out how everything works and how it works?  Due to the lack of uniform, convenient tools and approaches, it is everywhere possible to find incorrect work with execution threads, inaccurate synchronization, huge fragments of the UI and activation classes, a mixture of business logic and UI. <br><br>  In this report, you will find an honest comparison of the ‚Äúnew-old‚Äù architectural approaches (Clean Architecture, MVP, MVVM, DI) and tools (RxJava, Dagger 2, Retrofit, Otto and others) that allow you to write beautiful, testable code. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AlxMGxs2QnM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>4th place, rating 4.46</b> <b><br></b>  <b>[Android] Alexander Korshak - Experience in developing Cardboard applications for 3D reconstruction of medical data</b> <br><br>  The report, which fell a bit out of the standard Mobius format and, nevertheless, collected enthusiastic feedback from listeners, is devoted to an interesting way of using Cardboard and similar devices (eg Gear VR) in medicine and diagnostics. <br><br>  It all starts with a ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù for the ‚Äúsmallest‚Äù, through the thorns of the pitfalls, proceeds to the stages of implementing the idea: starting from choosing the ‚Äúiron‚Äù platform, VR-engine and 3D grid building method to implementing control and working with large MRI files / CT. <br><br>  By the way, in 2017 Alexander will speak at Mobius with the report ‚ÄúSpherical video in Android: 50 shades darker‚Äù.  The talk will focus on not the most trivial aspects of working with a spherical video: its format, various projections and the very ‚Äúright‚Äù approach to play such a video on Android in Cardboard, Daydream and GearVR <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dRFOTMyVokg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>5th place, rating 4.44</b> <b><br></b>  <b>[iOS] Irina Dyagileva - Typography in iOS</b> <br><br>  Do you know the words ‚Äúkerning‚Äù, ‚Äúinterlineage‚Äù and ‚Äútracking‚Äù?  If you are engaged in creating a UI, but the answer to the previous question turned out to be negative - you are here!  Was it so that having set all the parameters specified by the designer, did you still get the ‚Äúcurve‚Äù result?  After the report you will understand why this is happening. <br><br>  Irina examines all the mechanics of text rendering, the main font metrics, character attributes, and demonstrates the possibilities that iOS provides us with advanced text formatting. <br><br>  The report is equipped with an interactive demo with examples, so you will not be bored! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZU6bMSQo1Sk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>6th place, rating 4.39</b> <b><br></b>  <b>[Android] Jan Zhulanov - Android Apps on Kotlin: Why It's Good</b> <br><br>  Although Java 7.0 support appeared in Android 7.0 (we all understand that this is not exactly the Java that spins on the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù), no one wants to break backward compatibility and write software for the OS with a market share of less than 1%. <br><br>  That is why Kotlin is actively growing in mobile development, and the JetBrains team is well aware of this.  In his report, Yang talks about what the developer gets with the transition to this language.  It's not just about the brevity of the code, the report covers the following topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Advantages of Kotlin (in comparison with Java in general and Java 8 in particular); </li><li>  What has been done and what is being done to program on Kotlin for Android was even nicer; </li><li>  An example of using the features of Kotlin: Anko library overview for quick and easy creation of layouts. </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdJxgjY_4jQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>7th place, rating 4.37</b> <b><br></b>  <b>[Android] Matvey Malkov - The Art of Rx</b> <br><br>  Hardcore report on reactive programming for Android, which became a continuation of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DEatfi4am0HU">report of Matthew with Mobius 2015</a> .  Starting with how to <i>think</i> , the speaker proceeds to how to <i>do it</i> , at the same time telling how <i>not</i> to <i>do it</i> . <br><br>  For a long time I will not describe it, just leave you with a video and a couple of reviews from listeners: <br><blockquote>  <i>Matvey is a very charismatic speaker and can clearly convey the complex ideas of the principles of reactive programming.</i>  <i>I liked the report very much both by its technical complexity and by the way it was submitted.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>About Rx much has been told before, but I have never met such a deep story before.</i> </blockquote><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9Y6EZPxXxYk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>8th place, rating 4.22</b> <b><br></b>  <b>[iOS] Evgeny Rtishchev - Reactive MVVM</b> <br><br>  Another ‚Äúreactive‚Äù report, this time for iOS developers.  Starting with a general overview of the architecture, Eugene proceeds to the practical implementation of the multi-threaded MVVM approach using the example of the Sberbank-Technology project: how the model works in practice, what difficulties may arise, and what functionality could be implemented ‚Äúreactively‚Äù on ReactCocoa (KVO and establishing dependencies between several data changes). <br><br>  The end of the report is devoted to the benefits that can be obtained by implementing the MVVM + R architecture: a smooth UI, a simple View and test VMs. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6hVvstMEjoY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The remaining reports can be viewed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrGcqryHxqRs%26list%3DPLb1A91j1236pH1yoUvq5YDZUWAJz1T4DF"><b>on our YouTube channel</b></a> .  Without registration and SMS, of course :) <br><br><hr><br>  In general, if the videos were useful to you, interesting or just curious, and you want to get a new portion of Mobius earlier than after 9 months - <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/registration/"><b>registration for Mobius 2017 is</b></a> open.  Video recordings of all reports will be available to all participants who filled out the conference feedback form already 3-4 days after the conference. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320392/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320392/</a></p>
