In what directions the transformation will occur and what tools are necessary for it, read under the cut. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/57d/fc9/84d/57dfc984dfd34057aafef020f269ea67.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to a recent study by Oxford Economic Research, executives who supported job virtualization and strategies to increase business mobility surpassed their colleagues in a number of ways, including higher revenues and profits, low costs, a high retention rate and customer satisfaction.  It becomes obvious that in the near future, to achieve success, organizations will need to be actively involved in the digital transformation of both business processes and IT infrastructure and corporate policies.  To do this without the help of third-party specialists is a non-trivial and difficult task. <br><br>  Citrix provides new opportunities to overcome the challenges in the digital transformation process.  New Citrix products and services provide enhanced functionality for users in a unified and secure digital work environment.  New mobile, <a href="https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2017/05/23/hybrid-multi-cloud-application-delivery-becomes-a-reality-with-netscaler-adc-12-0/">software-defined network</a> and analytic services within the Citrix Cloud, <a href="https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2017/05/23/new-sharefile-solutions-for-todays-modern-workspaces/">advanced workflow tools</a> and intelligent information protection infrastructure, designed to simplify access and control of applications and data, facilitate the implementation of workflows and provide employees with flexible work in mobile mode.

At the same time, 78% of surveyed companies plan to increase these costs in 2017. The active introduction of cloud technologies creates difficulties for end users who have to use several cloud services, applications and data sources, not to mention the need to use different access technologies and several sets of credentials .  Shadow IT resources create problems in the form of using unauthorized applications and tools, which complicates the maintenance of the IT complex and increases the risk of breaching information security.  To maintain employee productivity, Citrix provides an <a href="https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2017/05/23/three-ways-citrix-workspace-raises-the-bar-on-productivity-and-security/">updated and secure digital working environment</a> that unifies access and management of mobile applications, SaaS, web, Windows applications and documents, and also consolidates access, control, and workflow in one solution.  Using the unified registration system, employees have secure access to the same functionality on any device.  Unlike other solutions, Citrix's secure digital workflow is based on a contextual approach.  This is the only solution that includes collaboration, data rights management and business processes.  Directly in a secure digital work environment, users can create, edit, and collaborate on Office 365 online documents. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2017/05/15/2017-the-best-year-for-citrix-cloud/">Citrix has accelerated the development of cloud technology innovations</a> with the release of new services and features to expand this powerful model for delivering business environments.  These services include <a href="https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2017/05/23/xenapp-essentials-and-xendesktop-essentials-weve-only-just-begun/">XenApp Essentials and XenDesktop Essentials</a> , the workload of which is implemented in Microsoft Azure, but they are managed from Citrix Cloud.  Additional Citrix Cloud services include a solution for managing mobile devices and XenMobile applications, as well as the NetScaler Gateway Service, which allows customers to quickly and easily create a gateway-in-the-cloud.  In addition, Citrix Cloud offers integration with the Azure Active Directory, offering administrators the opportunity to use the opportunities provided by the Internet of Things and other new services developed by the Citrix Lab. <br><br><h3>  Enhanced Protection and Advanced Analytics </h3><br>  According to a global survey conducted in 2017 by the <a href="https://www.ponemon.org/">Ponemon Institute</a> , 73% of respondents called data management, 76% configuration management and 72% application management as the main conditions for reducing risks when creating a new IT infrastructure in the next 2 years.  Increasing and changing the perimeter of corporate security creates a need for a smarter approach in managing information security policies across the entire new perimeter.  In order to help customers effectively protect their environments, Citrix Consulting Services introduced <a href="https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2017/05/23/reduce-risk-by-tapping-into-the-citrix-consulting-security-practice/">Security Practice</a> and Citrix Analytics, a new security and behavior analysis solution that extends the functionality of the <a href="https://www.citrix.com/blogs/2017/05/23/netscaler-mas-12-0-for-application-analytics-management-in-the-hybrid-cloud/">Citrix NetScaler Management and Analytics System (MAS)</a> and offers new features for detecting suspicious applications in the framework of Citrix products (XenApp / XenDesktop, XenMobile, ShareFile, NetScaler) and proactive risk elimination. <br><br>  Using a large set of machine learning algorithms, Citrix Analytics correlates and analyzes data collected from various sources to detect and isolate users' risky actions.  These user risk actions are combined to create an aggregated risk profile.  After detecting risky actions, Citrix Analytics activates a wide range of policy controls to neutralize the threat.  These policy controls include multifactor authentication, recording user sessions, setting hard data access settings, blocking suspicious applications, and even quarantining users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a97/e00/d15/a97e00d158df492d9e34f5820fe07129.jpg"><br><br>  Although Citrix Analytics places great emphasis on security, there are other areas, including performance and availability, in which Citrix Analytics offers great benefits.  Several analytical modules are implemented in the software NetScaler MAS (Management and Analytics System).  NetScaler MAS is a software product that performs network management and analysis.  NetScaler MAS provides the following features: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Centralized management for high performance</b> : NetScaler MAS automates administrative tasks, including configuration and certificate management, in order to save time and eliminate human factor errors.  NetScaler MAS also integrates with cloud management software and SDN. </li><li>  <b>Monitoring and Analysis</b> : NetScaler MAS uses network data to proactively identify and eliminate errors and detect security threats. </li><li>  <b>Application Lifecycle Management</b> : NetScaler MAS monitors and manages applications across the entire application delivery infrastructure </li></ul><br>  Read more about the solutions presented at Citrix Synergy at my next articles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330522/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330522/</a></p>
