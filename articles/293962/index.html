So, the background. <br><br>  It was filled up as always hard.  Mountains of information, tasks, plans, thoughts and conclusions did not allow to go to the country of Morpheus.  It was thought that something was about to change.  It was understood that something had to be solved, vectors and directions had to be changed, but nothing was done, which led every day and night only to life problems and nervous breakdowns. <br><br><h3>  How to deal with laziness? </h3><br>  How are other people struggling with this?  This question tormented me for a very long time, but I never found the answer.  At first I found excellent excuses, something like ‚Äú <i>and you try not to be lazy in a country where a person cannot walk an extra hundred meters and therefore puts the car at the entrance on the lawn</i> ‚Äù.  Obviously, ‚Äúone‚Äôs own atmosphere‚Äù influences a person, but this fact did not stop me from seeking a solution to the problem, but only provoked me.  I really wanted to get to the truth and open my eyes to everyone.  And then I realized that I was digging in the wrong direction!  The realization that I'm not lazy came not so long ago.  I was looking for a solution to a problem that actually was not. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Once again, floping myself for not having done anything, and if I did, then I understood something nonsense - this is not laziness.  After all, during bouts of laziness, a person, trivially, does not want to do anything and is somehow not particularly soared about this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b6/02d/68c/7b602d68c5254fada21dc05f4cc194b3.jpg"><br><br>  And then another!  I am well aware that this is important and necessary, but I find ten elegant reasons and excuses to move it all for later.  And it would have been okay if I had suffered, but I forgot, but it was not there!  You worry, no transference gives you a moment's peace, you are very steamed over all of this! <br><br>  You can consider it a rest, do you say?  But no.  After all, when you rest, you charge energy, like a smartphone connected to the mains.  But in fact it turns out that you are connected to the power grid, you are lying pretty, and only this network does not work, and everything you do is lose this precious energy. <br><br>  <b>Awareness is a cure</b> .  It was with the understanding of everything that happened that I began to look for an answer and found it.  Fortunately, Google immediately understood what the matter was and gave me such a thing - procrastination. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c77/fad/a7d/c77fada7d4534e1a8418784bedb65781.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Reading the article</a> , I got the impression that I was looking in the mirror.  The first thing changed was the opinion of others.  I realized that the people around are not lazy, he wants to change a lot, but he cannot, and he may also suffer, even if quietly in the corner, imperceptibly to those around him. <br><br>  That would have called the traffic police on the bastard who blocked the entrance to the courtyard, would help the passer-by to rise, but somehow it does not work.  There is a type of self-justification, ‚Äú <i>what if someone else has already called or a passer-by who follows me will help</i> ‚Äù. <br><br>  The real truth is hidden in the following quotation - ‚Äú <i><b>One can always find many well-founded excuses for not being able to meet the deadline</b></i> ‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  How to deal with procrastination? </h3><br>  After all, this is really the disease of the 21st century! <br><br>  There is an exit.  It may be purely individual and subjective, because the root causes are different for everyone, and the result is the same.  It helps me planning, planning and planning again. <br><br>  The first thing to do is to throw out <b>all the plans and thoughts</b> from your head <b>, and transfer it to paper or electronic form</b> .  And it works!  This is similar to the situation when the hard disk is full of the necessary information, but very buggy.  Which exit?  Pour everything you need on a USB flash drive / cloud storage and bam - already there is a place and information is not lost.  So it is here. <br><br>  <i>Evernote</i> helps me in this regard, but you can also be helped by a paper notebook, because to each his own! <br><br>  I have two files: one common task and the second task for each day.  It's simple.  During the day, you write down all the tasks and thoughts in a general note, and set deadlines, and when you go to bed, you make a plan for tomorrow.  You transfer to it what you are going to do and what you can do (you look into the general file and take some of the tasks from there). <br><br>  Know that not everything depends on you, and the world is full of accidents.  After all, a meeting can be canceled, and the time allotted for this meeting will simply disappear.  But it should not be so!  You should always have your plans at hand and quickly correct them.  There was free time - see the general to-do list.  Perhaps there is a thing that just enough for two hours allotted for the meeting. <br><br>  It is worth understanding - that procrastination does not pass quickly.  She's coming back.  It is like a coil.  The main thing is that you can and must fight it! <br><br>  And how do you deal with this, not afraid of the word, the disease? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293962/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293962/</a></p>
