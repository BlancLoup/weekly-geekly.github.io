After graduating from college and starting to build a career, I realized that continuous development is the key to success.  And books are the most accessible development tool.

      From this point on, my home library began to grow with professional literature.  However, here I encountered some problems. <br><br>  First, I could not buy all the books I wanted.  I just did not have enough money. <br>  Secondly, purchased books often turned out to be absolutely useless, despite the excellent reviews. <br>  Finally, some books lost their relevance and I would like to put them somewhere, but not throw them out ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24a/d30/e97/24ad30e97fe54572bcbd41eff73ceb1a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The idea was in the air, I caught it and tried to launch a community for the exchange of professional literature.  The idea was that users added their own books, which they wanted to share and share with them. <br>  Unfortunately, this experiment failed because users did not willingly add their books, and for a long time on the site it was possible to take only my personal books. <br><br>  Failure fails, but the problem has not gone away.  Fiction is a little easier - there is a really good selection of books in the libraries of large cities.  You can not say about the professional literature, the more highly specialized or in English. <br>  Such books are quite expensive and quickly lose their relevance. <br><br>  I found a like-minded person and now we are trying to solve these problems again, but with a different approach. <br>  We create a rental service for professional literature.  I will not give any links, since the purpose of this post is not to attract users.  I will tell you in detail about our project in the ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù hub as soon as we launch the prototype (this will happen at the end of February). <br><br>  Today I would like to ask for help from the community.  I am sure that GikTimes has a reading audience, and I want to ask some questions that will help us in our work on the project. <br><br>  Thanks in advance for your help. <br><br>  <b>In all matters we are talking about professional literature.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376109/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376109/</a></p>
