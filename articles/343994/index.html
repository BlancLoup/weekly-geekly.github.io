A couple of sleepless nights, several versions - and so was born the instruction that we want to share with you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Instructions to tomato </h2><br>  Hello.  Today we will get acquainted with the technique of tomato and how to apply it to work in our company.  Those who are interested in the description of the technology and the history of its occurrence - well in Google. <br><br>  We will consider everything on the REALITY known to you.  So, let's imagine that you have a big serious task ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ki/j_/go/kij_goyb9n-bp8tx4v77afamjdo.png"></div><br>  What do you usually do?  Of course, you start to solve it (perhaps a bit of suffering).  At first the task looks like something vague.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7b/pa/lk/7bpalk-ypguucsmr_4o2mdmdda8.png"></div><br>  Then you start to look for the essence and look for a solution. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zr/fx/od/zrfxodsyqolt4snfgculp4n0ujw.png"></div><br>  The picture is lined up in the head more and more clearly <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wh/w2/l0/whw2l0ivmwnk76cvhxnw7h3nk6c.png"></div><br>  With each step, the decision seems more correct and attractive, and you are just handsome, something to hide <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6u/u7/uy/6uu7uyrqsprllweb2zjqif5njdm.png"></div><br>  It seems that the last step remains, and nothing foretells trouble. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/if/7e/q5/if7eq5bfepoueikqpca29w3rdsu.png"></div><br>  You sit and work focused <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uw/uk/a6/uwuka6srq3zpxhd5kbdfhxvhtxc.png"></div><br>  Suddenly‚Ä¶ <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3-/xj/md/3-xjmdviyjw0jcuxolv3q3aunbq.png"></div><br>  Yes, yes it came.  A colleague / boss / passer-by, who urgently, very urgently needs an answer to his question.  Otherwise, the end of the world will come. <br><br>  You listen to him carefully and give an answer. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ea/-j/ef/ea-jefbiu6ja4kivhw34g_grfbs.png"></div><br>  When the distractor is completely satisfied with the answer - he leaves.  You return to your task and what is there <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7b/pa/lk/7bpalk-ypguucsmr_4o2mdmdda8.png"></div><br>  The picture of the solution that you so carefully lined up is lost and will have to be restored again. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zz/td/ft/zztdftv5udoleo_ieexjvrqaqc8.png"></div><br>  But do not forget about <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dy/rr/2v/dyrr2vbaq2-zdcnlvhlljjw1rgy.png"></div><br>  After all, this can be repeated several times, and you have many colleagues.  Everything goes in a circle - it seems to you that according to the task you have already described / assigned / told / responded / coded something ... but is that so? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6z/gw/fp/6zgwfpb2w1ibxgwfekwmuvorgui.png"></div><br>  As a result, the boss comes to you, with a completely logical question. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w9/c8/4u/w9c84uap9lejq5ze8n0emijs7g0.png"></div><br>  Common situation?  What to do with it?  You can not refuse a colleague.  You are fighting for one thing and should help each other always and in everything. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j4/c7/hv/j4c7hvp2wtkuz5vvrmxf_enlsyy.png"></div><br>  One never knows, and you need the help and advice of a colleague. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y-/26/zz/y-26zz9dgdnwcol4goe3a5uax5s.png"></div><br>  But let's think - each of us can respect and appreciate the time and work of others.  And just do not destroy the brain of colleagues, because  switching between tasks - crazy stress and a huge pile of wasted time <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3m/zw/bg/3mzwbgqy9flepfvcgmoux8rk440.png"></div><br>  What do we suggest to try here and now? <br><br>  Estimate how much you will live without answering your very URGENT question to a colleague.  Ten minutes?  Twenty?  For how much the world will not be cruel and unfair to you? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ht/p6/xp/htp6xped0t7vtiupi5mqk4dfip4.png"></div><br>  Answering this question for yourself, compare the figure with our option - 40 minutes. <br>  For 40 minutes, the world will not stop spinning. <br><br>  So, we are already on page 8, but the essence is what? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/dh/5f/eydh5f2diw30pe_tstixu5n5vrq.png"></div><br>  We suggest every hour to detect 40 minutes, in which everyone will work only on their own tasks absolutely without any distractions to anything. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2q/mx/cw/2qmxcwnugzlq5axcbjbcxy9gfgc.png"></div><br>  This is TOMATO. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kf/ja/oo/kfjaooi1kg5xr45mzyatvbks8t4.png"></div><br>  What does every hour mean?  At 8-20 the first tomato starts.  This means everyone, without being distracted by external / internal stimuli, does only his own tasks and does not distract his colleagues.  And so it will not come yet 9-00.  The tomato is over and you can escape - answer colleagues, drink coffee, take a turn to the toilet, etc.  At 9-20 a new tomato starts. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5d/is/xs/5disxs6x-pcmmn3mzb3f-tg4wmy.png"></div><br>  What does each person mean?  That this rule applies to the whole company.  Those.  if a tomato is coming now - you can write your questions to colleagues.  But get an answer only after the tomato. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7s/cf/kw/7scfkwoaxdlvewqkzlnqyh24hqc.png"></div><br>  But what if a colleague still comes in time for a tomato and asks questions?  Just remind him of the tomato.  Over time, he will get used. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l2/ue/pa/l2uepawqxgjyjvpzumtbi7_kibq.png"></div> <br>  How can I work if I am a support engineer / call center specialist / just helping everyone and everything and my task is to respond to external stimuli?  Just as they worked, just keep in mind that you may not receive a response from some colleagues immediately.  To put up with it, prepare questions, send them to a colleague and do other tasks. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lu/pf/r2/lupfr25bbpylqdtmi1j0rzg6fpy.png"></div><br>  What tasks are better to include in a tomato?  Those that require a lot of concentration.  It can also be meetings with other colleagues. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/re/tb/-j/retb-jirb10nqk_lmrldystb0fq.png"></div><br>  And what during the action of a tomato, even on the seals on the Internet can not be seen?  It is necessary to exclude not only external stimuli, but also any distractions.  We want you to focus only on your tasks.  Prepare yourself before the tomato, pour yourself some tea, put aside all the gadgets, close all social networks, news sites, forums, sit comfortably.  Do only tasks.  Catch the stream. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2v/fz/dz/2vfzdzgobfaw3tkjclw24sjthlq.png"></div><br>  And if prom fallen?  Each rule has its exceptions.  And such a list of exceptions we have to make together.  If a BLOCKER situation arises - you certainly have to distract the one who is under the influence of a tomato.  But in order not to distract everyone - it is worth developing a clear instruction.  To whom to go first, when prom fell, and who is next in the list.  Of course, your task is to revive the patient so that he is not dead for too long. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nb/pl/oq/nbploqxttly6oyub9akfgcx3hp8.png"></div><br>  But what about your meetings, when the answer does not get for hours?  Here in practice we apply antipomidor.  If you need a meeting of more than 1 tomato (for example, 2 hours).  Small anti-tomatoes for 10 to 15 minutes are inserted into it, in which the meeting is terminated and all participants take telephones in their hands (which they do not do during the meeting so that it is productive), respond to messages to colleagues, solve problems, save the world. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z7/ra/cc/z7raccgqucodbc8fpppx7gc-yus.png"></div><br>  But still ... why TOMATO?  The creator of the method had only one timer at hand. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-s/au/l7/-saul74i01asgfj1uk3vhw9geim.png"></div><br>  That seems to be all. <br><br>  We believe that by applying this practice we will be able to solve problems more focused and less distracted.  Get better results and work under less stress due to switching.  What do you think? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zz/5d/so/zz5dsoaxrg9be0nogp_on028zbq.png"></div><br>  You probably have questions, thoughts and suggestions ...
