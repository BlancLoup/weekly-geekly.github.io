  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hello, I got a call from this number</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Today we want to tell you about another interesting opportunity that opens up for the user integration of virtual PBX and CRM-system, as well as using flexible addressing settings.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b10/93b/974/b1093b9742af4ee7bda90f4eee74be0a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Last time, we already talked about the correct identification of the subscriber number so that both the manager and the customer could call each other through the virtual PBX, but today we will speak about a slightly different story - when the number is known, but it is not clear who to call. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with one of our customers, which is engaged in the provision of services in the field of beauty and health.  A fairly large salon has a pool of regular customers, and also periodically launches ‚Äúbring a friend‚Äù programs, and also advertises itself on the Internet and with the help of regular announcements.  At the same time, there are several administrators sitting on the phone at once who, in a certain proportion (which no one knows, depending on the working time), divide the tasks of outgoing calls to each other. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The task from which this customer came to us turned out to be the following: the efficiency of the administrators fell because when they called back from clients or potential visitors to the salon, they fell for a random manager, resulting in the following conversation: <br><br>  - Hello, did you call me? <br>  - Hello, I do not know.  What is your name? <br>  - Mikhail Mikhailovich Kruzenshtern. <br>  ‚ÄúSorry, I didn't call you, but maybe it was another administrator ...‚Äù <br>  - (customer hangs up) <br><br>  The expected low conversion of such conversations led to the fact that the company management was thinking about changing the practice of handling incoming calls, and this turned out to be quite possible in our PBX Hive. <br><br>  The idea is as follows: when an employee makes a call to a specific number, the subscriber is recorded behind him.  For example, manager No. 1 called Mikhail Mikhailovich, and manager No. 2 called Peter Petrovich to invite both for a Thai massage - after all, they were recommended by Inga Prokofyevna, who had already undergone procedures in the salon (and you can understand her, she would get bonuses for both they will come).  But neither Mikhail Mikhailovich nor Petr Petrovich did not answer the call, because in the meantime they both drank beer in the bath.  But like normal people, they see a missed call from an unfamiliar phone number and call back to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed5/2eb/8a7/ed52eb8a711a4bf4810414621cd33047.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thanks to our routing scheme, which was formed automatically at the time of making calls by managers, Mikhail Mikhailovich IMMEDIATELY calls up to manager number 1, and Peter Petrovich calls manager number 2, that is, to those who called them.  Moreover, in the routing rules we can indicate the time of availability of each of the managers, so that the call is transferred directly only during the working hours of each employee.  If the call does not come to his shift, you can direct it to the voice menu, another employee, manager to the mobile or manager - it all depends on the situation and company policy.  But the main thing is that these parameters are configured in Hive without any difficulties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fe/52b/4e4/1fe52b4e42a2415da9c4087ab9615da5.png" alt="image"><br><h3>  Connecting CRM </h3><br>  The next stage of the project, which we went along with our client, is the integration of the created routing scheme with the CRM system.  If you regularly read our blog, you know about the integration of Hive with amoCRM.  This open platform is simply connected to our virtual PBX and can work both in the web interface and on a mobile device - that is, it is accessible to everyone and on any platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df4/c15/87e/df4c1587ecd54b50984fa50893bc00b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The essence of the integration lies in the fact that before calling the manager a client card is filled in amoCRM.  If this is an existing client, the card should already be, and if the recommendation is, it is filled in by the manager of the questionnaire processing results.  Further, the manager number 1 makes a call, Mikhail Mikhailovich does not pick up the phone.  But when he calls back, the call is transferred to the manager number 1, and on the screen of his computer (or tablet or smartphone), a client card appears. <br><br>  What does this give?  The manager immediately knows who is calling him.  And since we address each employee only those clients with whom he has already worked, the massage lover will hear the familiar voice in the handset and will communicate with the employee already known to him.  With regard to new customers who the company called for the first time, the manager can immediately start a conversation as follows: <br><br>  - Hello, Mikhail Mikhailovich, we are very glad that you called us back! <br><br><h3>  Flexibility is key </h3><br>  The real-world case study that we covered in this post is a good example of expanding the flexibility of the front office with simple cloud solutions.  Using simple automation schemes, companies can provide truly personalized service, provide convenient tools for sales managers, and track work with each contact and each potential customer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88d/d67/14d/88dd6714debc4f80a808b42efb495942.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By connecting to this <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iptelefon/blog/272699/">IP-SIM scheme</a> , you can connect with employees, no matter where they are at affordable rates, and using advanced <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iptelefon/blog/313442/">caller ID capabilities, you can</a> create the feeling that an employee calls him from his mobile or vice versa from a single multi-channel number.  All this can be assessed at work by ordering a <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">virtual PBX</a> service on <a href="http://www.iptelefon.su/">the IPtelefon website.</a>  Regarding integration with amoCRM, our support service will help you customize it with all the nuances described above. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314572/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314572/</a></p>
