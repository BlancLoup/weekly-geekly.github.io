Yes, many of them use completely medieval methods, but this does not mean that the collection service cannot be adequate, civilized and legal.  For example, in many countries, collectors successfully work, avoiding ‚Äúlawlessness‚Äù. <br>  Why is this topic close to us?  The fact is that among our customers there are financial organizations that periodically need to remind their borrowers that "it is time to return the debt."  And they do this without painting the fences with paint, but simply by launching smart calls to customer numbers. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  <b>ZeOn and auto call</b> </p><br><p>  In fact, any modern PBX can produce automatic dialing on a given list of numbers.  For this, a short message is recorded, call parameters and forth are set!  It‚Äôs just not in every system that you can customize this process so that it brings results and does not interfere with your work. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a86/e81/416/a86e814162e14b8c80a3006239633912.jpg" alt="image"><br><p>  Creating the engine of our virtual PBX, we have developed a truly flexible module of auto-dialing, which allows you to configure such parameters as the number of simultaneous dialing, the frequency of calls, the start and end hours of the call.  Moreover, we recently developed an open API for our virtual PBX and have already talked about the possibility of connecting a CRM system.  Through the same API, you can set up any auto call patterns directly from business systems, but we'll talk about this a little later. </p><br><p>  When deploying the ZeOn PBX, we install the autodial module on a separate server, which allows you to avoid ‚Äúclogging‚Äù of protocols and confusion in the reports, especially during the debugging and configuration phase.  But this is not necessary, as auto-dialing can be used as part of the main server of communications, and even with the <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">cloud-based PBX Hive</a> , receiving both telephony and the ability to call as a finished service. </p><br><p>  Figure 1. Dialing Number Dialing Interface </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/897/819/cc8/897819cc86824cae8d5d6fb634f4f7db.jpg" alt="image"><br><p>  <b>Settings</b> </p><br><p>  But back to the technical parameters.  Why do we need all these settings?  The number of simultaneous dialing helps determine how many outgoing calls can be made simultaneously.  For example, if you use a channel that allows you to make 10 calls at the same time, it is best to limit auto-dialing to a maximum of 5 simultaneous calls, and then employees and customers will not suffer from constantly busy lines. </p><br><p>  The parameter ‚Äúset frequency‚Äù can provide an opportunity to remind oneself to a person with different intensity.  For example, people with a small delay can be notified once a day, and malicious defaulters - at least every 5 minutes.  The bottom line is that changing this parameter allows you to find a balance between the costs of calls and the possible economic effect of debt repayment. <br>  Finally, you can determine at what time the call is happening.  In some cases, companies include a function during business hours to catch a person with the phone turned on, while in others it is better to call in the evening or early in the morning.  However, with large amounts of dialing, you can use the available IP channels just during off-hours for your company. </p><br><p>  Figure 2. Parameter Settings </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fc/1fa/15d/2fc1fa15d99a4dd7ad5b37aad4990f33.jpg" alt="image"><br><p>  <b>More effect</b> </p><br><p>  However, not always such a call gives its results and there are several reasons for this.  For example, a person may not pick up the phone from a specific phone number.  And here ZeOn has a real advantage - we have developed a ‚Äúcarousel‚Äù system, which substitutes a lot of different initial phone numbers for making an autodial.  Each time dialing a certain number, the program changes the data of the automatic number identifier (AON). </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1e/3ac/06f/a1e3ac06f9f64014a29f8bdf3a54d03c.jpg" alt="image"><br><p>  Therefore, there is no way to either add the phone number to the ‚Äúblack list‚Äù, nor learn how to recognize the collector numbers. <br>  Another interesting feature is the automatic transfer of data and parameters for dialing.  As you can see in the screenshot, by default the system means downloading a ‚Äúpack‚Äù of phone numbers that will be called.  You can simply copy numbers from Excel or your accounting system and start the process through the web interface.  However, you can do otherwise. <br>  The presence of the API makes it possible to connect the auto call module directly from the business application in which user data is stored.  This approach opens up the following possibilities: as soon as a delay occurs, the program can start auto-dialing itself before it is redeemed.  Depending on the parameters of the loan, you can configure different call scenarios, voice messages and fully automate the process of telephone reminders. </p><br><p>  <b>Nice addition</b> </p><br><p>  As you understand, for the operation of the auto-dialing system in the company, a software <a href="http://zeonpbx.ru/">PBX ZeOn</a> should be installed or a <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">cloud PBX Hive</a> ordered.  In this case, you can both manually download numbers and set parameters, as well as ensure full integration of business systems and telephony tools to automate the call-up process.  In any case, this function is simply an addition to the main service and will be available to all users of ZeOn PBXs, as well as to Hive subscribers who work on tariffs from 1,000 rubles per month.  An important achievement is that this system does not tie you to a single telephony provider, you can always connect your operator via SIP.  But we are always ready to provide you with numbers and communication channels from the company <a href="https://www.iptelefon.su/">IP Phone</a> . <br>  So, ‚Äúsmart calling‚Äù is not a luxury, but a turnkey solution that is available along with the main telephony services even at no additional charge.  So use, gentlemen! </p></div>
