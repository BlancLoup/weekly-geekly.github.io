Regular lokalka per 100 people, which currently does not exist.  We did not have technical support, they coped with everything themselves, were indignant at the forum, called for help, everyone knew each other and, accordingly, those who were more or less versed in computers were in respect.  They were called to their homes for "a glass of beer", "for cakes" and so on.  Of course, these people helped with computers.  It happened for thanks, it happened for money, but everything was always good.  Fortunately, the network was for 100 people and everything was in one neighborhood.  Nobody owed anything to anyone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2 years have passed, the network has collapsed, I changed the provider to a new, courageous and, frankly, youth representative of this sphere.  I've always been good.  I could easily set up my Internet connection, I didn‚Äôt have to call anywhere if the Internet was lost - everything was restored very quickly.  The network grew, requests to the SPD from the provider also grew, the subscriber base increased and, accordingly, more frequent failures began to take place.  So - I had to call.  The voice of the robot said that the operator will now respond.  He answered after 2-3 minutes.  At that time, the problem was solved fairly quickly (it was in the wrong settings on the hardware) and this was forgotten. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Now telecom is already entering a new level.  A lot of new services have appeared, the load has increased several times (where without it?) On the SPD and technical support by phone obviously could not cope with such a load.  And immediately there was a way out - the organization of mobile teams to take clients home to solve problems with their equipment, with their computers, with their ‚Äúnon-standard equipment‚Äù, etc.  Exit brigade in the form of one person at a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe SAP.  The network was growing, ‚Äúfreaks turned on computers‚Äù needed more and more to solve the problems of subscribers, and not to sit and not to dry on lurks, towers, etc.  Now this technical support is already working on a regular basis, it is free, it solves problems by phone, comes to the subscriber's home, sets up both wi-fi and routers, and changes the cable if the dog chews it at home, cut off drug addicts in the stairwell, consults subscribers on issues such as "I can not log in contact.  Help please? ‚ÄùOr‚Äú I bought a TV here and I want to watch movies on it through a computer.  I heard that this can be done. ‚Äù <br><br>  What is technical support?  These are the same doctors, the same people who solve problems related to the computer.  For this technical support there is no such obstacle as ‚ÄúYOU DIBLE !!!! 1111 WE HAVE EVERYTHING WORKING, PUSH YOURSELF !!!! 111‚Äù.  Perhaps it is time for all providers to think about the topic that their subscribers are all that they have.  Without them, they are nothing.  Just a bunch of people drowned in their tsiska, twisted pair tons, kilometers of optical fiber and heaps of useful iron, which is just waiting for it to be loaded to the full, will allow through it gigabytes of information to carry the Internet to every house :) <br><br>  What is the perfect technical support?  Think about it. <br><br>  All a good day / evening / night :) <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> Thanks to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_recommend/69302/">good</a> for karma :) Moved to another blog :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/69294/">https://habr.com/ru/post/69294/</a></p>
