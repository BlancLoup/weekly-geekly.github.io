  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT Music Fest: guitar instead of Claudia and music instead of code</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On June 5, the first IT Music Fest took place in the Hophead pub in Moscow.  The staff of Positive Technologies, who created the Lucy's First Job group, invited for the joint performance musical groups from Mail.Ru (GODCats), Kaspersky Lab (Out Of Office) and ABBYY (ABBYY Band).  The special guest of the event was the electronic duet 4beatten, uniting the staff of two IT companies (PT and Luxoft).  About what came out of this, read our report. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pt/blog/303078/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cf9/e2f/e2e/cf9e2fe2e3ff483caef0be2969999e30.png"></a> <br><br>  As befits a rock concert, IT Music Fest began 50 minutes after the time specified in the invitation.  It was assumed that the musicians will distribute them to friends and colleagues, but many invited relatives and relatives.  The event is important: almost all groups on this day performed for the first time at a real open festival, and not at the corporate party of their company.

      - And where to sit down so that it was not loud?  - they asked me at the entrance a couple at the age: the parents of one of the musicians. <br>  - I'm afraid today it will be very loud everywhere ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So it happened.  People reached for the dance floor before the first band entered the stage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1f/6dc/02b/a1f6dc02b3114b49a8a55646d47cb589.png"><br><br><blockquote>  <i>Lucy's First Job Positive group started playing less than a year ago.</i>  <i>Now consists of eight people.</i>  <i>The team was so enthusiastic about creativity that after the first concert in Positiv they decided to organize a festival of musicians from IT companies.</i>  <i>While convening participants and looking for a place, played at the sixth PHDays.</i> </blockquote><br>  The pub crashed under the covers of System of a Down, Three Days Grace, The Offspring, and the support group did not catch their breath even during the melodious Jungle Drum and History Repeating.  By the exit of Godcats the dance floor and the air in the close pub were red-hot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c4/4ce/a23/4c44cea23e244c82ab299a1d13ab01e8.png"><br><br>  <i>Photo: <a href="https://new.vk.com/nastja_smilik%3Fz%3Dphoto417562_419289520%252Falbum417562_00%252Frev">Nastya Kozlova, VK.com</a></i> <br><br><blockquote>  <i>The backbone of Godcats ("Divine Seals"? "Seals from God"?) - These are artists from Mail.ru GROUP.</i>  <i>They found each other within the same department.</i>  <i>Creative artists were also talented musicians.</i>  <i>The group began to rehearse right in the office, the repertoire was made up of covers of their favorite songs.</i> </blockquote><br>  On stage, Godcats are really like cats: stylish and emotional.  The crowd in front of the stage was raging under the tunes of Dani California, Personal Jesus, Enjoy the Silence, I Think I'm Paranoid. <br><br>  Brutal Out of Office followed: two beards for four developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b32/5ac/9be/b325ac9beace4283bf18cfa4ad8ead32.png"><br><br><blockquote>  <i>The Kaspersky group turned out to be older than all the speakers: they have been playing at corporate parties since 2011 and have already performed several times at external venues: at the Rain Major Club and twice at the Glastonbury Pub at the Rock Around Festival of Kaspersky music teams.</i> </blockquote><br>  They included Russian-language songs in their repertoire: ‚ÄúHoochi-kuchi Men‚Äù, ‚ÄúChizh and Co‚Äù and ‚Äú17 years‚Äù ‚ÄúChajf‚Äù.  Played touching Every Breath You Take and Knocking On Heaven's Door.  The public did not want to let them go and asked for supplements: alas, the time for each team‚Äôs performance was limited, otherwise the festival could last for the whole night.  And Monday morning. <br><br>  After them were ABBYY Band. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/459/b34/5ee/459b345ee7ee4815bf0ed211f6767241.png"><br><br><blockquote>  <i>They gathered in 2011.</i>  <i>For the first time they performed at the New Year party party ABBYY, the subsequent concerts also coincided with internal events: New Year, birthday of the company, summer company party, February 23 and March 8.</i>  <i>The guys at rehearsals decide what to play and how it will sound: exactly as in the original or in the new arrangement.</i>  <i>They say about themselves that, perhaps, The Cranberries and Red Hot Chili Peppers play more often than others.</i> </blockquote><br>  Their pub debut was excellent: after the lyric Time Is Running Out and Karma Police gave off the heat to Californication and Rock'n'Roll Queen. <br><br>  The rock fest ended with electronics: Kraftwerk and Tom Yorke covers also had fans who were very sad that the set 4beatten was so short. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0af/154/18d/0af15418dc9a4401b97132ed11cdf596.png"><br><br>  As promised, it was very loud for five hours in a row, and the public demanded more and more.  Although each team came with its own support group, everyone mixed up on the dance floor and warmly welcomed the speakers no matter where they worked.  Several groups told me that since the founding of the group, some musicians changed jobs, but they did not leave friends: they continued to go to rehearsals, to perform, discuss and support new ideas.  In short, guys, music is out of competition.  However, the word to the musicians themselves is what they think about the festival: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>Many thanks to the organizers for a cozy place, superfluous holding, enough time to check and tune our entire complex sound, to the sound engineer - for a very attentive and delicate work before and during the performance, and listeners - for the fact that they ‚Äúburned‚Äù and did not spare themselves. not us!</i> <br><br>  - <b>Maxim Gaponov</b> , duet 4beatten (formerly Positive Technologies, now works at Luxoft) </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <i>Thanks to the organizer for the Fest!</i>  <i>It turned out great, the guests are delighted, we - even more so!</i>  <i>And the performance of Lucy's First Job was great - a separate respect for the drummer!</i> <br><br>  - <b>Sergey Aksenov</b> , drummer ABBYY BAND </blockquote><br>  We also asked to share our impressions with one of the festival attendees, TADviser columnist Natalia Lavrentieva: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe IT Music Fest, in my memory, is the first event that brought together‚Äú IT musicians ‚Äùfrom different companies in one place.  In my opinion, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãorganizing such a platform is simply excellent: for creative employees, this is an opportunity to show and express themselves to a large enough audience, and for their colleagues and others involved in the IT industry, the opportunity to be in the circle of "their" in an informal setting, listen to music and support musicians, chat.  In fact, this is one big common music IT corporate.  It was felt that the creative experience of the performing groups was different, but, in my opinion, all the groups performed with dignity.  Of course, this time far from all the music groups from IT companies were present, but since it was only the ‚Äúfirst pancake‚Äù, and it didn‚Äôt come out at all as a ‚Äúlump‚Äù, the next festival has every chance to acquire a large scale ‚Äù. </blockquote><br>  PS <br><br>  If you are confused by the word ‚Äúfirst‚Äù next to ‚ÄúIT Music Fest‚Äù, then we clarify: of course, this is not the first event at which representatives of several IT companies played at once.  This has happened before: just remember <a href="http://www.webplanet.ru/news/life/2009/04/03/mediumwell.html">Medium Well 2009</a> .  However, until now such events have been one-time.  Therefore, in our case, the expression ‚Äúfirst IT Music Fest‚Äù is an application that there will be a second one, and beyond.  So if you work in the IT industry and you have your own group, <a href="http://vk.com/itmusicfest">join us</a> ! <br><br>  <b>Posted by</b> Anna Davydova, Positive Technologies </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/303078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/303078/</a></p>
