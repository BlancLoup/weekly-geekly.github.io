      <strong>Note:</strong> Do not confuse this project with the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/startup/28305.html">Startup Factory</a> !  In addition to the first word, there is nothing in common here: we are talking about something completely different and very specific.  Although I would be glad if ‚Äúthat‚Äù Factory would accept the proposed project into ‚Äúproduction‚Äù.  Moreover, being built, ‚Äúour‚Äù Factory could serve as one of its instrumental components. <br><br>  <strong>What are we talking about?</strong>  We offer you a rather ambitious project, the first phase of which is aimed at creating two products related to the new wave of the social Internet.  In sufficient detail about this project and its current state can be found in the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D59375">presentation materials</a> .  After the publication of these materials, I received a number of questions and comments, which prompted me to change the name of the project and develop a new, shorter version of the Executive Summary, which I cite below ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Factory of new social web resources</strong> <br><br>  <strong><em>The first products of the project:</em></strong> <br><br>  1. <em>Platform</em> - a tool for building various social resources Web 2.0 / Web 3.0, ranging from mass and leisure, and ending with professional and business. <br>  2. <em>Business resource</em> - focuses on a variety of high-tech industry without a specific binding to any corporation or a narrow field of knowledge.  The resource is created on the basis of the platform and is the first product at the output of the Factory of social web resources, demonstrating its capabilities <em>(see <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D72401">also</a> )</em> . <br><br>  <strong><em>Main market:</em></strong> <br><br>  1. <em>For the Platform and Factory, in general</em> , small and medium-sized companies in various business sectors, web startups of various applications. <br>  2. <em>For the Business resource</em> - specialists, including those that are poorly covered by the existing social networks.  These are relatively well-to-do and accomplished individuals who use the resource as a means of mutually beneficial information exchange and professional communication, as well as tools for joint activities that go beyond the narrow corporate interests. <br><br>  <strong><em>Basic concepts:</em></strong> <br><br>  - descending SaaS - resource construction scheme; <br>  - focus on the resources of the new wave: more efficient, more intelligent and more motivational. <br>  - a single stream combining various types of information; <br>  - Institute of experts and intellectual search; <br>  - flexible methods for creating interconnected, autonomous and self-governing communities; <br>  - incubator and testing ground for start-up social resources. <br><br>  <strong><em>Direct prototypes and competitors</em></strong> are not known: neither in terms of market segments, nor in terms of the concept of construction and operation. <br><br>  <strong><em>Regions of implementation: the</em></strong> project initially focuses on users of the .com domains (primarily the United States) and .ru.  It is assumed a slight shift in the implementation phase of these two versions of the project. <br><br>  <strong><em>The main sources of operating profit are:</em></strong> rent for the platform and hosting resources, fees for Business services and other resources generated by the project, advertising. <br><br>  <strong><em>Required investments</em></strong> - from $ 250 thousand (two rounds without initial financing) to <br>  $ 400 thousand (three rounds). <br>  <strong><em>The maximum period of return on investment</em></strong> (from the moment they are received) is 3 years <br>  <strong><em>The minimum profit of the first year after the return on investment</em></strong> is $ 400 thousand. <br>  - <em>The first, more extended annotation of the Business Plan (Executive Summary) can be found in the annex to the main <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D59375">presentational note</a> .</em>  <em>A sketch of the Agreement (the Protocol of Intent) is also presented there, after signing of which (together with the NDA) the Terms of Reference will become available.</em>  <em>The representative version (extended ‚Äúabstract‚Äù) of the Business Plan, together with one of its sections, on the basis of which, in fact, the TK was developed, are laid out in the sub-forum of the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowforum%3D829">Commonwealth</a> .</em>  <em>To gain access to the Business Plan materials, you must first register with iTech Bridge and send a request to the pilot / / / itechbridge / com address.</em>  <em>It goes without saying that everything said in the above documents is subject to negotiations.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>I am ready to discuss any comments and suggestions on the project.</em>  <em>The only and big request: please ask questions and criticize after reading, at least with the <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D59375">presentation note</a> along with its FAQ-section.</em>  <em>Although familiarity with the documents attached to it also does not hurt.</em>  <em>So each of us will save a lot of time ....</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16856/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16856/</a></p>
