You know, not a bad thing. <br><br>  The guys organize large conferences and master classes.  And they are attracted to them with the help of free time webinars from the same lecturer.  He briefly describes the topic of the future report.  But he describes it not in the style of ‚Äúthere is such a tool, but I will tell about him in two days at a paid seminar ...‚Äù, but does provide key information on the stated topic. <br><br>  I admit honestly, I don‚Äôt plan to go for a paid continuation - that is, the main part.  This is both expensive and during working hours, and who knows how effective it is.  But I don‚Äôt refuse to look at the free, quite informative mini-seminar.  Of course, if the topic is close. <br>  By the way, you can not only watch, but also be present in the hall.  But the first option is more convenient for me.

      Today's webinar was about content marketing.  Several items added to my list.  I will tell about what I heard.  I do not mind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b29/f53/b57/b29f53b57c6f4538b551a45b14462446.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The webinar was conducted by Alexander Bankin.  The lecturer himself specializes in e-mail marketing.  But it was not only about this.  Worked with tele-2, kupikupon, kupivip, etc. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So: <br><br>  <b>1. Company as an author</b> <br><br>  An interesting introduction to the fact that the content goes to the first position.  And that companies that provide high-quality information block, have a clear advantage over the others.  This is not only about corporate (and non-corporate) news, but about the whole strategy of dialogue with the client. <br><br>  As a format - distribution, storytelling on the site, video content, educational information, industry calendar, etc. I will tell you more below. <br><br>  As content - informing about the industry as a whole, interesting stories about outstanding people, interpretation of various terms, a selection of resources, etc. <br><br>  The idea, I repeat, is that the company not only sells its services and constantly feeds its direct promotional materials, but is a full-fledged author and supplier of really useful and interesting content.  Accordingly, the image of the company is changing - it is not just an importer, it is a useful informant, which forms a completely different attitude. <br><br>  Me personally, Megaplan immediately comes to mind.  I love these guys, google it, who does not know. <br><br>  <b>2. Newsletter and Capture Pages</b> <br><br>  It's simple.  Bankin advises not to be limited to the right block of the site for the widget through which the subscription is made.  Moreover, this is not the most readable area, as we know. <br><br>  He believes that this should be a clearly visible block on the main one.  Due to this, the number of subscribers is significantly increased. <br><br>  Moral: do not move the panel to where there is free space. <br><br>  <b>3. Progressive profiling</b> <br><br>  Ask subscribers not only e-mail, but also FI with the name of the company.  Let this be the second step for subscription.  But the main thing is optional.  The subscriber should have the right to refuse.  Obligation is annoying, voluntariness attracts. <br><br>  <b>4. Surveys conducted for the clients themselves.</b> <br><br>  Pretty interesting stuff.  Not just to find out what the client likes / reads / looks at, but also to share top results on the site.  Customers themselves will be interested to see how they converge with others or differ from them.  Trifle, and attracts. <br><br>  <b>5. Content about corporate life</b> <br><br>  Many are engaged in this, many hear about it.  But in my opinion, it was and is a cool tool in terms of revitalizing the company.  Tell us about what is happening in your team, at your work.  Brightest just pass the video.  For example, a small, beautifully mounted film about office life, cutting videos from the original corporate parties of your company.  From the written - an interview with an employee of the company.  One day from his life or some impressions of work. <br><br>  Storytelling is always very tasty, it makes you real. <br><br>  <b>6. Photobank</b> <br><br>  Perhaps one of the most interesting discoveries for me personally. <br>  More respectful relate to companies that have unique photos on the site.  Not googled and copied, and those that others do not.  Everyone solves this problem in different ways, most often through photobanks.  Recently, it has become especially fashionable to have copyrighted photos.  But what to do if there is no person who will regularly photograph something for you? <br><br>  That's what.  Get a corporate photo bank.  And send the letter to your colleagues: ‚ÄúIf you have any beautiful photos - whether it be a photo of the team, nature, or any lifestyle - throw them on our photo bank.  The best will be published on the site and in the mailing lists. ‚Äù <br><br>  If employees get into this and get used to your photo bank, as if it were your native instagram, everything will work out.  You will have a permanent database of photos, from which you can always do something interesting.  For example, take a photo of your team, bring it in b / w and place it on the main slide in the slides.  Or use a beautiful sunset from a colleague to post in social networks.  If you are writing about the conference, make a screen from the video. <br><br>  Beautiful, individually, and most importantly - yours. <br><br>  <b>7. Industry Calendar</b> <br><br>  Nothing special, from the category of amenities.  Congratulate your customers on the holidays of their sphere.  There is already on the flight of fancy - congratulations can always be made original and beautiful. <br><br>  <b>8. Glossaries, resource lists, educational materials</b> <br><br>  Just diversify your newsletter with not only articles, but other unusual formats.  Entertain as you can :) <br><br>  <b>Finally</b> <br><br>  Eight points - not because they were eight.  And because about the way they formed in my head.  In general, all this is my interpretation of what was heard with personal additions. <br><br>  Hope you find it useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286902/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286902/</a></p>
