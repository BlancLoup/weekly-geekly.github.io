Are you familiar with the red car effect?  A person buys a red car and suddenly begins to see red cars on the street all the time.  This distortion is called the ‚Äúillusion of frequency‚Äù or ‚ÄúBaader-Meinhof phenomenon‚Äù and is due to the selective attention of the brain and the tendency to always confirm its point of view (confirmation bias). <br><br>  The brain is not only susceptible to cognitive illusions, but also able to respond flexibly to external stimuli.  Is it possible in this case to "pump up the mind", having a stimulating effect on it?  A meta-analysis of the University of California showed that short-term cognitive training leads to positive effects in important cognitive functions, as measured by laboratory tests. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Working memory is able to store information and access it in the short term.  This is a narrow ‚Äúbottleneck of intellect‚Äù that affects cognitive processes of a higher order, including controlled attention and reasoning.

      An analysis of 20 scientific studies <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25102926">showed</a> that working memory not only trains, but also influences mobile intelligence. <br><br>  Mobile intelligence is the ability to think logically, analyze and solve problems independently of previous experience.  Mobile intelligence does not depend on previously accumulated knowledge. <br><br>  Just three weeks of regular cognitive exercise significantly increases the number of neural connections.  This leads to the acceleration of the exchange of information between different parts of the brain, improves the ability to memorize new information, develops logical thinking, the ability to compare facts and quickly make the right decisions. <br><br>  There are a lot of cognitive workouts.  We collected a few, characterized by simplicity, small volume and quick result (at least at once you can assess at what level your working memory is now). <br><br><h2>  Long Term Memory Test </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rc/cy/8z/rccy8zlc1tdh5ynoqiocn8lpths.png"><br><br>  Although the <a href="http://cft3.foodforthebrain.org/">Cognitive Function Test</a> was originally created for people aged 50 to 70 years old as part of an Alzheimer's program, it is suitable for any adult who wants to evaluate the capabilities of the brain.  The test consists of four parts and is designed for 15 minutes.  During the test, it is important not to be distracted and not to take breaks. <br><br>  The test is conducted in English.  By registering and answering simple questions on memory disorders (which we hope you don‚Äôt have yet), you will receive several different tasks, evaluating your reaction speed and working memory depth. <br><br>  Below is an example of the test result.  This person has been praised, he has no cognitive impairment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yi/hr/we/yihrwekulexzxhqgkizysznw5e8.png"><br><br>  Average rating - 54.2.  Since the test is designed for the 50‚Äì70 age group, the majority of respondents dial from 43.2 to 65.2.  You obviously can have more points. <br>  A score between 38 and 43 describes getting into the risk group.  A score below 38 is classified as ‚Äúsignificant risk.‚Äù <br><br>  It is important to remember that poor cognitive test scores can also be caused by depression, medications, certain types of dyslexia, or other factors. <br><br>  It is not recommended to return to the test during the year to avoid the effect of learning, as this may affect the reliability of the results obtained. <br><br><h2>  Reaction test </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jw/b-/sh/jwb-shbk6dveypmpwk-lfenckwo.png"><br>  <i>The graph on the horizontal axis shows the test results in seconds (only results better than 1 second are taken into account).</i>  <i>On the vertical axis - the number of tests passed with this result.</i> <br><br>  How quickly can you react if necessary?  The ability to react quickly may be critical in different situations.  <a href="http://medlistok.com/reaction_test.asp">This test</a> allows you to determine the time of your reaction - when the traffic light turns green, you must immediately click the mouse button. <br><br><h2>  Short Term Memory Test </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lg/yl/n0/lgyln0xn6-mrzgsjhamp_giisc8.png"><br><br>  This test <a href="http://medlistok.com/testmemory.asp">will help determine</a> how strong your short-term verbal memory is.  The test is designed for 10 minutes.  In many ways, the test is similar to some tasks from the Cognitive Function Test, with the only difference being that it was done in Russian and is faster. <br><br><h2>  Quick working memory test </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k6/qv/du/k6qvduv-7s5opqlzdzjj7flrqfi.png"><br><br>  Do you know why the bank card number is most often 16-digit?  Such a number is impossible to remember at a glance.  You can check this statement in <a href="https://www.humanbenchmark.com/tests/number-memory">Number Memory Test</a> .  For about 5 seconds, numbers will appear in front of you, and you will need to repeat them.  The average level for this test is 7 digits. <br><br><h2>  Lumosity </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e0/x4/cm/e0x4cmymzq3ilxb3u3ahrslzcim.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.lumosity.com/">Lumosity</a> is one of the most popular daily workout programs for adults.  Made applications for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.lumoslabs.lumosity%26hl%3Dru">Android</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lumosity-brain-training/id577232024%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> , in which there are more than 25 games for brain training.  Games adapt to the user level, maintaining the bar of difficulty in solving a wide variety of tasks.  The assignments are built on university brain research, mainly from Stanford University. <br><br><h2>  Braininq </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vn/a8/kp/vna8kp30lhbz5rjjxmv0hbhtoji.png"><br><br>  A large and mostly paid online training system developed by an international group of neuroscientists.  The site offers classes of 90 minutes per week (it is possible to download the course on the iPhone / iPad). <br><br><h2>  NeuroNation </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mw/ek/ip/mwekipyeulcamc0xkrokzgzt80u.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.neuronation.com/">An interesting course</a> with interestingly illustrated tasks, more like a game.  Gamification training promotes greater involvement for maximum efficiency. <br><br>  At the beginning of the training, you will be asked to answer 11 questions that will allow you to build a personalized training plan that meets your goals and current level of performance. <br><br>  Preparatory tasks that enable you to evaluate your level of working memory management are provided free of charge. <br><br>  By the way, there is a Russian counterpart - the <a href="https://wikium.ru/">Wikium</a> service. <br><br><h2>  Wikium </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v7/zi/s2/v7zis2yqqfiema1r3e20ricgqko.png"><br><br>  Wikium offers to get tested first and determine the quality of your thinking.  Based on the test results you get a training program.  The course consists of daily 15-minute classes. <br><br>  The service works on the freemium model: users can purchase access to all courses, specialized tasks, and the ability to compete with other participants.  Premium account costs 1990 rubles per year. <br><br>  On the project site it is indicated that solving the proposed problems will help to stop being distracted by external interference and irritants, will teach you to quickly switch between different types of activities, concentrate on tasks and work more productively.  The company even has games that work with a device that reads the electrical activity of the brain (alpha rhythm and beta rhythm) - you need to work with them with full concentration and in absolute peace of mind. <br><br><h2>  Brain metrix </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7d/vm/jf/7dvmjfbbyh9jkq2wlymvwu3jxgk.png"><br><br>  And this is already a real game, but it was created ‚Äúaccording to the precepts‚Äù of neuroscientists.  Show the high result will be able to one who will well predict the exact place where the ball will go. <br>  When playing, try not to focus on where the ball is, but try to predict where it may be. <br><br>  On the site you will find other free games against the computer that will help your brain to better operate with working memory.  In some cases, you immediately write the number of points, after which you do not need to continue the game - you have already achieved perfection. <br><br><h2>  Eidetic </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tl/v2/pk/tlv2pkpuuogbkglrt-qqx_z_gay.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.eideticapp.com/">Eiedtic</a> uses the interval repetition method to help you remember something from important phone numbers to Wikipedia facts.  The method consists in the repetition of the memorized educational material at certain, constantly increasing intervals.  Interval repetitions do not involve memorizing. <br>  It works only under iOS. <br><br><h2>  Fit brains </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/_z/p8/dk_zp8q9motza_ld5ap6z-hhoqu.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.fitbrains.com/">The service</a> works with the brain in six areas: focusing, memory, speed, logic, visualization and language.  Fit Brains is the only brain training program that includes Emotional Intelligence (EQ) training in addition to cognitive development exercises.  There is both a paid subscription and free courses. <br><br>  * * * <br><br>  Brain training includes many types of training: memory tests, IQ tests, agile intelligence, reflex actions and creativity.  The combination of different games with a planned workout schedule will stimulate all the main areas of the brain responsible for memory and enhance your skills. <br><br>  As we grow older, we need to train the mind more to maintain and hone skills.  Even puzzles, puzzles, crossword puzzles, card games, and perhaps some computer games can help stimulate brain parts related to cognitive abilities, logical problem solving, memory storage, and other mental abilities. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  <b>Added project "Wikium".</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371451/</a></p>
