I chose this text because, even while writing a thesis, I was well acquainted with its contents.  Since then, about a year has passed, and only now I decided to publish it.  It is noteworthy that during this time, solving the problems of protecting <i>IP</i> telephony, I had the opportunity to work with both <i>TLS / SRTP</i> and <i>IPsec</i> .  I hope for someone it will be useful (as for me, at one time), or at least just an interesting reading.  Write your opinion about this material. </p><br><p>  <b>PS</b> By virtue of a sufficiently large volume, I deliberately lowered some things, omissions are marked by a triple point.  The term Information Assurance was left without translation, I never met an analogy in Russian. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. Introduction </h2><br><p>  ... <br>  In connection with the requirements of the <i>Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</i> to include <i>IPsec</i> in every implementation of <i>IPv6</i> , it is reasonable to consider <i>IPsec</i> as a suitable protocol to ensure the security of <i>VoIP</i> .  However, now prefer to use the protocol <i>TLS (Transport Layer Security)</i> - to ensure the security of <i>SIP (Session Initiation Protocol)</i> , and the use of <i>SRTP (Secure Real-time Transport Protocol)</i> , to protect <i>RTP</i> . </p><br><p>  At the present time ( <b>approx. Translation</b> - at the time of writing the original, 2007) there is no comparison of these two approaches, this work provides such a comparison, discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each of the approaches.  Based on this work, executors and designers of <i>IA (Information Assurance)</i> will be able to make informed decisions. </p><br><p>  <i>SIP</i> becomes the dominant <i>VoIP</i> session <i>protocol</i> .  <i>RTP</i> is the dominant protocol for packaging voice data and, then transporting it, between terminals, over <i>IP</i> networks.  <i>TLS</i> , <i>SRTP</i> and <i>IPsec</i> are the protocols used to secure <i>SIP</i> and <i>RTP</i> sessions, they provide authentication, integrity and confidentiality of <i>VoIP-</i> related <i>IP</i> packets. ... The figure below shows the location of the <i>TLS</i> , <i>IPsec</i> , <i>SRTP</i> , <i>SIP</i> and <i>RTP</i> <i>protocols</i> within the model <i>OSI</i> . </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/al/e2/s7/ale2s7lztl_unytgrbcsn0kyirw.png"><br><p>  The figure below shows the general scheme of a call using <i>SIP</i> and <i>RTP</i> . </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l1/ux/n0/l1uxn0sblsrxefndbfrvxd_y_gw.png"><br><p>  ... </p><br><h2>  2. Review of protocols </h2><br><h3>  <i>Sip</i> </h3><br><p>  <i>SIP is</i> described in <i>RFC 3261</i> as an application-level control protocol for creating, modifying, and terminating communication sessions with one or more participants.  <i>VoIP</i> service <i>providers are</i> investing heavily in the development of <i>SIP</i> used for signaling in <i>VoIP</i> .  The diagram, in the figure above, as a whole, shows the flow of messages related to establishing a <i>SIP</i> voice communication session. <br>  ... </p><br><h3>  <i>Rtp</i> </h3><br><p>  <i>RTP is</i> described in <i>RFC 3550</i> as a protocol that provides end-to-end network transfer functions suitable for applications that transmit real-time data, such as audio, in broadcast or targeted network services.  Currently it is the only protocol suitable for voice over <i>VoIP</i> .  An <i>RTP</i> session is initiated by each <i>SIP</i> client upon receipt of <i>an ACK</i> or <i>OK</i> message, as shown in the figure above. </p><br><h3>  <i>IPsec</i> </h3><br><p>  <i>IPsec is</i> described in <i>RFC 4301</i> as a set of security services at the <i>IP</i> layer, which allows the target system to select the required security protocols, define algorithms, and enforce the cryptographic keys necessary to provide the requested services.  <i>The IPsec SA (Security Association) is</i> established before initiating <i>SIP</i> and <i>RTP</i> sessions, and once it is established, <i>IPsec</i> will be automatically used to secure <i>SIP</i> and <i>RTP</i> packets as they pass through the network layer of the <i>OSI model</i> , within the <i>IP</i> stack. </p><br><h3>  <i>Tls</i> </h3><br><p>  <i>TLS is</i> described in <i>RFC 4346</i> as a protocol for securing communications on the Internet.  The protocol allows client-server applications to communicate in a way that is protected from eavesdropping, damage and / or tampering with messages.  <i>TLS</i> version 1.0 is also known as <i>SSL (Secure Socket Layer)</i> version 3.1.  A secure <i>TLS</i> connection is established before initiating a <i>SIP</i> session.  <i>TLS is</i> used to secure <i>SIP</i> packets as they pass through the transport layer of the <i>OSI model</i> , within the <i>IP</i> stack. </p><br><h3>  <i>SRTP</i> </h3><br><p>  <i>SRTP is</i> described in <i>RFC 3711</i> as an <i>RTP</i> profile that can provide privacy, message authentication, and <i>Real-time Transport Control Protocol</i> <i>RTP</i> and <i>RTCP</i> protection.  The general message passing scheme for <i>SRTP</i> and <i>SIP</i> is the same as in the figure above.  <i>SRTP is</i> used to ensure the security of <i>RTP</i> packets, since they pass through the transport layer of the <i>OSI model</i> , within the <i>IP</i> stack, it relies on <i>SIP</i> messages, key exchange, and <i>TLS</i> , to authenticate <i>SIP</i> clients. </p><br><h2>  3. Comparison </h2><br><p>  ... </p><br><h3>  Complexity of implementation and standards coverage </h3><br><p>  In terms of implementation, <i>TLS is</i> easier than <i>IPsec</i> to integrate with <i>SIP</i> .  <i>RFC 4346 has</i> about 200 requirements for implementing <i>TLS</i> .  On the other hand, <i>IPsec</i> has more than 500 implementation requirements, described in about 11 <i>RFCs</i> . </p><br><p>  <i>The IETF has</i> published several documents on how <i>SIP</i> , <i>TLS</i> and <i>SRTP</i> can be integrated.  In addition to this, the Ministry of Defense has developed technical compatibility requirements applicable to <i>SIP</i> security with <i>TLS</i> and <i>SIP / TLS</i> integration with <i>SRTP</i> .  The authors of this article are not aware of the existence of IEFT documents describing how <i>IPsec</i> can be integrated with <i>SIP</i> or <i>RTP</i> , this issue is not well understood by the communications industry.  Nevertheless, some research-oriented implementations have appeared that show that it is more difficult to implement this, due to the need to access the operating system kernel.  <i>VoIP</i> providers typically install their <i>VoIP</i> applications on existing operating systems, such as <i>Windows</i> , <i>Linux</i> or <i>UNIX</i> , and usually have limited access, or do not have access to the operating system kernel at all. </p><br><p>  Implementing both approaches on <i>VoIP</i> devices may not be possible, depending on the vendor and device type.  For example, some endpoints are limited in memory, data storage size, and computing power and may not support <i>TLS</i> , <i>SRTP,</i> and <i>IPsec</i> implementations at the same time. </p><br><h3>  Hierarchical signaling support </h3><br><p>  The main marketing feature of <i>IPsec</i> is that it provides end-to-end encryption, which is required by most applications that work with data.  However, commercial voice offerings are based on a hierarchical signaling model, in which the OS (terminal device) notifies the <i>LCC (Local Call Controller)</i> , in order to establish a communication session, using <i>its own</i> signaling protocol.  <i>LCC</i> , as a rule, notifies the <i>SS (Software Switch)</i> provider, using <i>SIP</i> , to go to the external network, then the <i>SS</i> can notify another <i>SS</i> or <i>LCC</i> in order to complete the establishment of a communication session with the remote OS, as shown in the figure below (left) .  A proprietary signaling protocol is used between the Shelter and the <i>LCC</i> so that the service provider can provide the user with unique value-added functions, which is not possible if a standardized protocol has been adopted. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ja/v_/w6/jav_w6hgllmrxkuxh4wibqprraw.png"><br><p>  In a hierarchical model, each hop hierarchy must be able to decrypt the signal packet, process and re-encrypt it before sending.  This goes against the end-to-end security model.  However, both <i>IPsec</i> and <i>TLS</i> can be implemented within a hierarchical model; however, at present, <i>VoIP</i> providers believe that <i>TLS is</i> better suited to this model. </p><br><p>  The end-to-end security model is used to organize the data link and can be implemented using both <i>SRTP</i> and <i>IPsec</i> .  <i>IEFT has</i> published a key exchange method for <i>SRTP</i> over <i>SIP</i> packets, so a session can be established after the completion of the signaling.  A similar approach can be developed for <i>IPsec</i> , but this, at present, has not been done. </p><br><h3>  Bandwidth efficiency </h3><br><p>  Comparison of bandwidth efficiency makes sense with respect to the voice data transmission channel, since the effect of signaling packets on data packets on the bandwidth is insignificant. </p><br><p>  Comparing the size of <i>IPsec</i> packets with <i>SRTP is</i> quite difficult, since they depend on the mode used (transport or tunnel), the number of padding bytes, and the authentication and integrity control algorithms used.  Assuming that <i>IPsec</i> uses <i>ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)</i> protocol in transport mode with minimal padding and small size, it can be argued that <i>SRTP</i> is 6% more efficient for <i>IPv6</i> packets than <i>IPsec</i> .  If the integrity of the <i>IP</i> header is required to be monitored, then <i>AH (Authentication Header)</i> protocol can be used in <i>IPsec</i> , which will entail additional overhead. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fc/mf/3v/fcmf3v16l9kj98izp8xbpq0ke_m.png"><br><p>  Using the same prerequisites in the case of <i>SIP</i> , <i>IPsec</i> requires 2 bytes more, compared to <i>TLS</i> , to protect <i>SIP</i> . </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uj/ik/rn/ujikrne4wjfcb5ppddwqfjramnc.png"><br><p>  The impact of the <i>RTP</i> compression header is left without an estimate.  In environments where such compression is used, <i>SRTP</i> is 10 bytes more efficient than IPsec.  The table below summarizes the above. </p><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Protocol </th><th>  Package size, byte </th><th>  Bandwidth, KB / s </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  SRTP </td><td>  254 </td><td>  101.6 </td></tr><tr><td>  RTP / IPsec </td><td>  270 </td><td>  108.0 </td></tr><tr><td>  SIP / TLS </td><td>  1280 </td><td>  N / A </td></tr><tr><td>  SIP / IPsec </td><td>  1282 </td><td>  N / A </td></tr></tbody></table><br>
<h3>  Commercial use </h3><br><p>  Commercial <i>VoIP</i> service <i>providers</i> invest heavily in the use of <i>TLS</i> and <i>SRTP</i> , to ensure the security of <i>VoIP</i> .  <i>IPsec</i> was also considered for this task, but <i>TLS</i> and <i>SRTP</i> were considered the best solution.  Currently there is no commercial <i>IPsec</i> implementation designed to provide <i>SIP-</i> based <i>VoIP</i> security.  Vendors who use <i>H.323</i> legacy signaling for their voice solutions are more likely to choose <i>IPsec</i> to protect their solutions.  However, most <i>H.323</i> providers currently use unencrypted solutions and move on to <i>SIP-</i> based solutions. </p><br><h3>  Information Assurance </h3><br><p>  The most common argument for using <i>IPsec</i> is that it provides end-to-end encryption.  However, this advantage is not used in the case of <i>VoIP</i> signaling, since most implementations are based on, as mentioned earlier, a hierarchical signaling model, and <i>TLS is</i> better suited for this model.  ... </p><br><p>  The advantage of <i>IPsec</i> is that it protects data at the <i>IP</i> network level, which is lower in the protocol stack than <i>TLS</i> , which provides protection at the transport level.  ... </p><br><p>  Another difference between <i>IPsec</i> and <i>SRTP</i> is that <i>IPsec</i> encrypts the <i>RTP</i> header, while <i>SRTP</i> does not.  The advantage of using <i>IPsec</i> here is that it hides useful information from a potential attacker.  The disadvantage is that it limits the ability of firewalls and <i>SBC (Session Border Controllers)</i> to use microchannels on certain ports.  This is especially critical for firewalls and <i>SBC</i> acting as network address translation ( <i>NAT</i> ) devices for multiple overlapping <i>LCCs</i> .  Since the <i>IP</i> addresses of all arriving <i>VoIP</i> packets are directed to the firewall or <i>SBC</i> , the only distinguishing feature that the screen or <i>SBC</i> can use to determine the appropriate target <i>LCC</i> is the port number. </p><br><p>  Both protocols use similar encryption, authentication, and integrity controls.  For example, both protocols support public key encryption, <i>AES</i> symmetric encryption, and <i>HMAC-SHA1</i> imitation protection.  Thus, from this point of view there is no difference in security. </p><br><h3>  Connection establishment, change of keys and time of restoration of communication </h3><br><p>  To avoid an excessively long session setup time and a cutoff effect (packet loss at the beginning of a voice communication session), it is extremely important that the encryption key of the data transmission channel is distributed as part of the signaling process.  <i>The IEFT has</i> determined how <i>SRTP</i> keys are distributed as part of <i>SIP</i> signaling by placing the key in the <i>SDP (Session Description Protocol)</i> body of <i>SIP</i> messages.  IEFT has not yet developed an <i>SDP</i> encryption key distribution mechanism in <i>IPsec</i> .  Moreover, the request / response model from <i>RFC 3264</i> may prevent the inclusion of <i>IPsec</i> key information in <i>SIP</i> signaling messages. </p><br><p>  Another issue is the delay associated with changing keys.  Recent studies comparing the time for changing the <i>TLS</i> session and <i>IPsec</i> session keys have shown that <i>IPsec</i> takes about 20 times (26 ms vs. 1.3 ms) more time for changing keys than <i>TLS</i> .  This is not a long period for a single shift, but it can be a problem if thousands of end devices try to change keys at the same time. </p><br><p>  The last question is the delay associated with restoring a secure connection.  <i>SIP</i> using <i>TLS</i> requires a minimum of 6 message exchanges.  Restoring a <i>SIP</i> connection using <i>IPsec</i> is mainly related to the implementation of the <i>Internet Key Exchange (</i> IKE) protocol and will depend on how the main, basic, or aggressive mode is used in the first phase of the exchange.  Assuming that the main mode is used, <i>IPsec</i> requires 9 message exchanges (in the original, we are talking about <i>IKEv1,</i> which is currently replaced by <i>IKEv2</i> , and <i>IKEv2</i> , in turn, requires 4 exchanges if <i>EAP</i> is not used). </p><br><p>  ... </p><br><h3>  Network management </h3><br><p>  The main advantage of <i>SRTP</i> over <i>IPsec</i> is that the <i>UDP</i> and <i>RTP</i> packet headers are open to network service personnel, they can use the information obtained to find and fix network problems.  <i>IPsec</i> encrypts these headers, destroys such information. From this point of view, <i>IPsec</i> and <i>TLS are</i> comparable. </p><br><h3>  Topology Hiding </h3><br><p>  <i>IPsec</i> has an advantage over <i>TLS</i> and <i>SRTP</i> in concealing the network topology, since <i>IPsec</i> is able to encapsulate the original header inside an encrypted load when it is used in tunnel mode.  <i>TLS</i> and <i>SRTP</i> do not have this functionality, and must be relied on external <i>NAT</i> device to ensure it.  However, most <i>VoIP</i> implementations are used not in the tunnel mode, but in the transport mode, which also does not provide such functionality. </p><br><h2>  4. Conclusion </h2><br><p>  Based on our preliminary comparison of using <i>IPsec</i> and <i>TLS + SRTP</i> bundles to protect <i>VoIP</i> , it is recommended that developers use <i>TLS</i> and <i>SRTP</i> .  This approach is easier to implement and maintain, as it is more profitable than <i>IPsec</i> in terms of bandwidth usage.  There is no significant security advantage from using <i>IPsec</i> compared to <i>TLS</i> and <i>SRTP</i> . </p><br><p>  Such conclusions are based on an analysis of existing standards, current implementations of <i>TLS</i> and <i>SRTP</i> from <i>VoIP</i> providers and scientific-oriented implementations of <i>IPsec</i> , as well as on previously published comparisons.  However, there are published papers comparing <i>IPsec</i> and <i>TLS / SRTP</i> implementations to ensure the security of voice sessions under working conditions either do not exist or they are limited and offer only a basis for further uses.  One of the goals of further research can be effective mechanisms for transmitting <i>IPsec</i> key information through <i>SIP</i> messages and a comparison of security and performance for each approach. </p></div>
