People have a goal, whether to make a purchase, find a recipe, or learn how to do something else.  For example, if you draw a button that you need to click on (add a position to the basket while browsing an online store), make a shadow for the button.  The effect of ‚Äúelevation‚Äù of the button will turn out, and this will help the site visitor to understand that this is the button, it is clickable and this is exactly what it needs. <br><br>  In addition to such graphic details, we often write instructions to help users navigate and understand what they should do next.  These instructions draw people's attention to the appropriate place and encourage them to take certain actions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Mental models </h5><br>  Designing and writing instructions are part of user interface design (UI), it‚Äôs like science and art, including copywriting and design skills, as well as an understanding of how people use mental models. <br><br>  The mental model is the person‚Äôs inner conscious presentation of how things work.  This is a broad concept of the cause of the actions and their results.  People apply these models to new situations and so there is no need to learn everything from scratch.  This helps us to understand the new much more efficiently.

      With experience, users develop mental models, seeing how different websites work.  They study all sorts of actions on the websites of online stores and compare them further with the actions of, say, photo sites.  This means that people use their stereotype or mental model of similar sites so that when they visit the next site, they can suggest what actions can be taken from experience. <br><br>  This is one of the main reasons why UI instructions are so important.  People also have negative experiences when their mental models were inaccurate or incorrect.  Such cases cause bad emotions, mistakes and inability to reach the goal.  An upset visitor can go to another site that is easier to use. <br><br>  By providing easy-to-understand, aesthetically designed instructions, such incidents can be prevented.  Good instructions will guide visitors to the site, even if their mental models are inaccurate or erroneous. <br><br><h5>  Here are some guidelines for writing UI instructions. </h5><br><br>  <b>1. Get to know your audience</b> <br><br><img src="http://iscr.ru/photo/1275917035_captchainstructions.png"><br>  When you know the peculiarity of your audience, you can imagine how and what words are best presented.  If your visitors are a homogeneous group, then we can assume that some will need recommendations to achieve their goals. <br><br>  Check out the example above.  Only experienced and quick-witted visitors will be able to understand the humorous instructions of the CAPTCHA form.  Inexperienced computer users and those who are not fluent in English would not know that ‚ÄúConfirm that you are human‚Äù means entering alphanumeric characters in the field. <br><br>  <b>2. Balance</b> <br><br>  Finding balance is always a problem.  When writing UI instructions, it is necessary to describe the essence in sufficient detail so that users know what to do, but not in such detail that these instructions become difficult to read and read.  Over time, people can perceive a very small amount of information. <br>  It is better to write instructions in a simple and accessible language that will help visitors complete their tasks quickly and efficiently.  Try to use short sentences when possible.  For example, this sentence can be easily broken into two: ‚ÄúClick the Add to Cart button, then the Remove button at the top of the screen.‚Äù <br><br>  <b>3. Remove unnecessary information</b> <br><img src="http://iscr.ru/photo/1275917451_userinterfaceinstructions.png"><br><br>  This paragraph is comparable to paragraph 2, but it is almost always better to edit the written text.  Easier to remove something extra from the finished text.  After all, you look at the text a bit from the other side.  In the example above, the instruction could be more effective with fewer words.  Too much unnecessary information. <br><br>  <b>4. Choose the most effective and accurate words.</b> <br><br>  The task of expressing the essence most accurately contains a fine line between words that are similar in meaning.  Usability research shows that people are browsing pages, not reading.  Thus, phrases must be formulated in such a way that at first glance any associations will arise in relation to an action.  Some people skim through the pages and barely pay attention. <br><br>  Use words that more accurately describe the essence.  ‚ÄúChoosing a date‚Äù is normal, but ‚ÄúClick on a date‚Äù is a more accurate statement describing the action.  Avoid double negatives.  Also, do not use jargons that some people may not understand, as well as industry abbreviations, technical terms, etc. <br><br><img src="http://iscr.ru/photo/1275917522_choosingwords.png"><br><br>  As an example of choosing the accuracy of words: when you look at this menu, do you understand the difference between ‚ÄúExplore‚Äù and ‚ÄúView‚Äù? <br><br>  <b>5. Write in the active voice</b> <br><br>  A valid voice will encourage people to take action.  The passive voice, on the contrary, contributes only to the fact that readers will yawn.  Compare these sentences: <br>  Valid deposit: "Click on the" Journal "link to find an article." <br>  The passive voice: "You must click the link" Journal "to find an article." <br><br>  <b>6. Aesthetic part</b> <br><br>  Designing UI instructions can be a problem.  You must determine where the instructions will be drawn graphically, and where to have the appearance of plain text.  Although it was said that the instructions should be noticed by the user, however, they should not be placed in such a prominent place so as not to overload the page and not disrupt the structure.  As an element of design, the instructions should be combined with the style of the site in general, and with individual elements in particular.  Conclusion: to bring into the plan at the initial site design such an element as a block with UI instructions. <br><br>  <b>7. Mark the line ownership</b> <br><br>  If the message does not fit in one line, but takes 2 or more lines, it is important that the user does not read, determine where it ends and where the second message begins.  The vertical spacing between related sentences should be large enough so as not to hinder normal perception, but at the same time not so large that confusion arises - are these sentences related.  When the instruction consists of several steps - observe the interval.  Number the points if the instruction is complicated. <br><br>  <b>8. Choose the most legible font.</b> <br><br>  Think carefully about the font.  Use one that will look consistent with the overall design of the site.  Regarding the font size - the text of the instructions should be clear to people of all ages.  Avoid using the text of instructions in the form of pictures, as users in this case will not be able to enlarge the text, if necessary. <br><br>  <b>9. Use images when it is more profitable.</b> <br><img src="http://iscr.ru/photo/1275917674_uiwithgraphic.png"><br><br>  Yes.  Sometimes it is almost impossible to describe something in words.  Images in this plan can help us.  For example, how to find your account number on a magazine label. <br><br>  <b>10. Apply in person</b> <br><img src="http://iscr.ru/photo/1275917747_humorousui.png"><br><br>  There is nothing terrible if we add the appeal personally to the user in the instruction itself.  This can help the user to get positive emotions, cause a smile.  The main thing is to make sure that there is no subtext in the message, and it cannot be interpreted differently.  In this example, the message may reassure the user a little.  After reading this message you do not feel like a nonentity, unable to store passwords in the place where they can be found. <br><br>  <b>11. Make instructions available.</b> <br><br>  It is very important to give the opportunity to read the instructions to people who find it difficult to read the small print and / or people using a PDA or phone. <br>  Some basic principles of ensuring accessibility when writing instructions are: avoid using text in the form of pictures, because  it will be impossible to increase the font size (paragraph 8);  provide text with alternative graphic content;  clearly separate the text of the instruction from the background so that it is easily visible.  In addition, links must contain a text that carries the meaning.  For example, the link ‚ÄúInstructions for using the form‚Äù is better than ‚ÄúClick here‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>12. Check out the instructions.</b> <br><br>  Check the instructions with people from different professions outside your office, not to mention that this is your project.  Watch the actions of one or more people performing the various tasks described by the instructions.  Pay attention to all difficulties where users resort to the help of instructions.  Repeat the check until people complete the task without problems. <br><br>  You may be surprised at how much time and effort it takes to write effective UI instructions.  However, this may be one of the most valuable steps in developing a successful UI.  Due to the simplicity and good perception of instructions, you can get great user support with positive feedback, because  you care about them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95948/</a></p>
