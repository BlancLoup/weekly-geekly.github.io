But if this all lags, users leave you.  Sometimes developers forget about it.  With the topic of front-end productivity, my colleagues and I will continue our online series in which we discuss current issues of client-side development. </p><br><p>  The live broadcast dedicated to the performance will take place <strong>on December 18</strong> on the AvitoTech YouTube channel.  Experts from Yandex, Tinkoff, Mail.Ru and Avito will take part in the discussion.  Under the cut - sample questions that we plan to discuss, and a link to the upcoming broadcast.  After the meeting, update the post, post the video, add it to your bookmarks if you are interested in the topic. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e1/if/up/e1ifupmk8574q3jwcmy9uvvqy54.png"></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="primernye-voprosy-dlya-obsuzhdeniya">  Sample questions for discussion </h1><br><p>  You can never predict which way the conversation will go.  But here are the approximate topics for discussion that we have outlined with colleagues. </p><br><ul><li>  How to collect metrics from users? </li><li>  How to work with the measurement results and how they reflect reality? </li><li>  How to find the slowest places in the project and eliminate them? </li><li>  How can the environment help solve performance problems? </li><li>  What tools to apply for all these tasks and do not dig? </li><li>  And most importantly: how to preserve the result and spread the culture of performance in your company? </li></ul><br><p>  In addition, we will try to answer questions that will be sent during the broadcast.
