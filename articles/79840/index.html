Start -&gt;</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Chapter 3 </h4><br><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  The book is devoted to the search for the fullness of life and joy in work.  These feelings rarely come by chance.  They require thoughtfulness, dedication, activity and readiness to reconsider their views when they are wrong.  This book indicates a strategy that allows you to plan and implement a career that is perfect from the point of view of success (and, as a result, life) in program development. <br>  The book is also devoted to how to develop the desire to live an extraordinary life.  Surprisingly, the desire to lead an extraordinary life when we begin our careers lives far from each of us.  Most of us just go with the flow.  Our expectations were lowered by all sources of information surrounding us: the media, our friends, acquaintances and relatives.  Therefore, leading an outstanding life should be your goal.  It is not so obvious. <br>  Most adults spend most of their waking hours at work, and according <a href="http://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/">to</a> a 2006 US Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="http://www.bls.gov/tus/charts/">report</a> , the average American spends half the time at work.  Leisure and sports are far behind and take only 15% of the time of wakefulness.  The facts say that we live mostly at work. <br>  And if most of life is absorbed in work, then the love of it is one of the most important recipes for the love of one‚Äôs own life.  An interesting, motivating, and giving a decent reward job will wake you up in the morning much better than stupid, medium-quality tasks.  If you work well, it means that 50% of the available time you are busy with what you are really good at.  Conversely, if you work poorly, then most of your time you will feel incompetent or guilty of working in half the power. <br>  Absolutely we are all looking for happiness.  At least, if our basic needs for food and housing are met, then most of our goals are based on the search for happiness.  Unfortunately, often our actions do not correspond to this overriding goal.  This is due to the fact that we are all human, and people tend to dwell on the means and forget about the ultimate goal. <br>  Maybe I would be happy if there was more money.  Maybe I would be happy if my achievements were valued more.  Maybe I would be happy if I was promoted or I would become famous.  But what if I was poor, with the most ordinary work, but at the same time happy?  Is it possible?  And if so, is it worth pursuing money?  Or for better work? <br>  Maybe not.  But what is truly true is that by concentrating our efforts on happiness as the main motivator, we can make much better decisions about what small steps need to be taken to achieve this goal.  Higher wages can really be desired and lead to happiness.  But if you take your eyes away from the main goal, then this can lead to the fact that you will seek higher wages at the cost of happiness.  It sounds crazy, but I did it.  And you may too.  Think about it. <br>  Throughout this book, I am going to give advice that I hope will lead you to a happier and more rewarding career (and as a result to a happier life).  Perhaps by following these tips, you will earn more.  Perhaps you will become more recognizable or even famous.  But please remember that these are not goals.  These are the means for its (goal) achievement. <br><br><h6>  Not knowing the obstacles! </h6><br>  Ironically, one of the most important steps towards building an outstanding career for me was the writing of the first edition of this book.  Then it was called ‚ÄúI worked in India (and all I received was this pathetic book): 52 ways to save a job.‚Äù  On the cover was a guy with a sign "Programming for food."  It was free and the title and the shocking red cover played on the fear of the Western world that all the work would be done by cheap outsourcing companies. <br>  The problem was that it all painted the wrong picture.  The bottom line is that if you want to ‚Äúsave‚Äù the work, then I'm not an assistant here.  This book is not about how to achieve a boring level of development so that you will not be fired.  This book is about how to be cool.  You will not win the race if you strive not to blow.  And you will not win in life if you try not to adjust.  Fortunately, this book is not about how to fix it.  In my direction, even the brain will not turn to think, and I hope you too. <br>  I remember very well that moment when I decided that my career would be outstanding.  I moved to work about the same way as I did through school years and graduated from college ‚Äî all this led me to a very mediocre career as a professional saxophonist.  However, due to a combination of luck and natural talent, I managed to get off the road and get a good job as a technical staff of one of the largest companies and become a respected person in this environment.  But it was only the beginning and I knew about it. <br>  One evening after work, I was looking through books in a nearby bookstore and came across Kent Beck‚Äôs Extreme Programming Explained in the novelty section.  The second title of the book was ‚ÄúUse change to the maximum.‚Äù  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãchange has always been close to me.  Until that moment, I always had difficulty keeping attention and I jumped from one job to another, often changing companies in which I worked.  The thought of ‚Äúsoftware development methodology‚Äù seemed unbearably boring and gave me management, but I decided that if it allowed me to constantly change something, it might help me not to get bored and not think about the fact that I need to change my job. <br>  Buying this book has been very successful.  When I began to read it, I could not tear myself away.  After tearing apart this book, I read everything I found on the Internet about the ideas of extreme programming (Extreme Programming - XP).  These ideas captured me so much that I even turned to our head of the information service and tried to devote him too.  I managed to convince both him and his subordinates and for the introduction of extreme programming, he sent many of us to the courses ‚ÄúImmersion in Extreme Programming‚Äù. <br>  If you wanted to study XP, then it was better not to find these courses.  It was like a backstage pass to the concert of your favorite rock band.  Having worked with these people, I became much smarter.  Became much more creative.  And when the courses ended, I was very sad.  I could not even imagine how I would return to my small office and beat my head against the wall of ordinariness that I had grown up at work. <br>  My colleague Steve, who wrote the essay included in this book, and I came to the same conclusion.  The only way to be with such people as often as possible is to become one of them.  In other words, if I wanted to be with people who can communicate with me one or two levels higher, then it‚Äôs not about the company I work for and not about the courses I attend.  I just have to understand how these people differ from others and work in this direction.  So I told Steve that I was going to be one of these people. <br>  This was a turning point in my career.  I even forgot about it and only years later Steve reminded me about this conversation.  Then I told him that for the first time I was invited to read the opening speech at the conference.  It was just amazing that someone asked me not just to speak, but to become one of the main speakers at the conference on software products.  I actually became one of those people whom I admired. <br>  I achieved everything without having a formal education in programming.  Before becoming a programmer, I was a musician.  I went to college to study music.  Since the musicians do not get much from the degree, I decided to skip all the classes that do not make me the best musician.  This led me to leave the university due to the fact that I had too many tails for a degree.  From this point of view, I was not qualified to program professionally - at least, if you look at the typical requirements for a ‚Äúprogrammer‚Äù position on the labor market. <br>  However, despite the fact that I was not prepared as a programmer, my experience as a musician gave me the opportunity to skip this step and not become an ordinary programmer (and who wants to be ordinary?).  Nobody becomes a musician to live a comfortable life without shocks.  The music industry is too cruel to make such a plan feasible.  All people who have become professional musicians want to be great.  At least at the beginning of the journey in the music world, the attitude to being great is simply binary.  Either be great (and, as a result, famous), or it is not worth while to go. <br>  I often wonder why so many good musicians are also good programmers?  The reason is simple.  The point is not that similar brain functions are involved, or that both professions are focused on details or that both require creativity.  The fact is that a person who wants to become great is much more likely to become so than someone who just wants to do his job.  And even if they cannot all be Martin Fowlers, Linus Torvalds or Pragmatists, setting such a high goal makes it more likely that we will stop at the level below average.

    <h6>  you should </h6><br>  Most people follow anyone's plans, but not their own.  To separate yourself from others, all you need to do is stop and take a good look at your career.  You need to stick to your plan, not someone else. <br>  How to make such a plan?  Development is a business.  As programmers, we are also businessmen.  Our companies did not hire us because they love us.  It has never been and never will be.  Because it does not apply to business.  Companies do not exist at all so that we have where to go every day.  The purpose of a business is to make money.  To succeed in the company, you must be clear about how you fit into the plan to make money. <br>  As we will see later, keeping you in the state, the company spends a lot of money.  She invests in you.  Your task is to become an uncompromisingly good investment.  You will judge your performance depending on the value that you bring to the organization or the client who hired you. <br>  Think of your career as the life cycle of the program you create.  It is created by you and your skill.  In this book, we will look at four facets on which business should be concentrated in the design, manufacture and sale of a product.  And we will see how these four facets can be applied in a career: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Choose a market</b> .  Consciously and carefully select the technology and business areas on which you will concentrate.  How to balance risks and rewards?  How to take into account the factor of supply and demand? </li><li>  <b>Invest in your product</b> .  Your knowledge and skills are the cornerstone of the entire product.  Proper investment in them is the key to good demand in the labor market.  Just knowing Visual Basic or Java is no longer enough.  What other skills might you need in the new economic environment? </li><li>  <b>Take action</b>  The simple maintenance of workers with serious skills does not bring the company money.  They must be brought by the workers themselves.  How to maintain the pace of such delivery, without messing with the hands?  How to find out that you represent sufficient value for the company? </li><li>  <b>Sell!</b>  Even the best product will not be sold if nobody knows about its existence.  How to get recognition in the company and in the industry as a whole without licking? </li></ul><br><br><h6>  New edition </h6><br>  This book is the second edition of the book "I worked in India (and all I received is this pathetic book): 52 ways to save a job."  The purpose of the reprint is to focus on what the first book really was about: creating an impressive career.  For this, I not only came up with a more positive title, but also added new content <br>  David Heinemer Hanson, the creator of Ruby on Rails and the partner in the 37signals project, wrote a new introductory word. <br>  Each section contains one or more essays written by people I have encountered or worked with and whose careers are truly outstanding.  These essays show what decisions were made by innovators, developers, managers and entrepreneurs on their way to success.  They also emphasize the fact that the techniques outlined here are not just assumptions applicable only to ideal horses in a vacuum.  These are real actions that real people can do. <br>  Some of the original tips have been removed and new ones added.  The entire final section ‚ÄúIf there is nothing to beat‚Äù has been removed.  New tips have been added to reflect the lessons I have learned since I published the first version of the book. <br>  Were added new section "Act!" To those tips that were in the first edition. <br>  This introduction and conclusion has been modified to more clearly reflect the book‚Äôs purpose and focus on an outstanding career. <br>  The purpose of the book is to give you a clear and systematic direction for building an outstanding career in program development.  We will look at examples and present a set of actions that you can take right now and that will have both short-term and long-term positive effects. <br>  And, as I said, we will not talk about how to save work.  If you are now afraid of losing your job, then the steps taken to build an outstanding career will save you from this fear.  Outstanding developers do not stand idle.  They are not in a fruitless job search.  Therefore, do not worry.  Focus on winning and forget about fear forever. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79840/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79840/</a></p>
