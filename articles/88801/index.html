Satisfied, but not original, I wanted something more.  I wanted to read books, I wanted to watch a movie, I wanted to hang in ICQ - and all this, preferably not with a matchbox, but from a normal, moderately plump, screen. <br><br>  Based on a bit of experience with HTC HERO, I knew that he had a screen - just the same size I needed.  And here in the shop window stood again and looked at me HTC Hero.  He is on me, and I am on him. <br><br>  I suddenly realized that I wanted this smart and that he, smart, also wants me.  All other devices, seemed suddenly insignificant, glamorous drawbacks, fashionable and stylish - but no more.  And the HTC Hero is ... It is ... It was Love - with a capital letter and first look.

      So I became the proud owner of a smartphone on the Google Android platform. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And here I am sitting in my apartment, on the floor.  In front of me - an open white box, in a chaotic manner scattered manual, charger and empty bags.  And also the device itself is included. <br><br>  The first thrill, familiar to many, when you take a new phone out of the package, realizing that it is already - everything, yours - but still continuing to disbelieve your happiness, it came down.  It was replaced by bewilderment - most of the features inside my NTS turned out to be obscure, and some of the expected ones were not there at all. <br>  If I were an old American, I would probably spit and return the phone back to the store, thus making the biggest mistake in my life.  But I was lucky - I was born Russian.  Where does Russian come to, if it is not clear to him? <br><br>  Right.  The brochure with the instruction was not even honored to be open, but after another five minutes I was scrolling through the Internet.  In short, in the end, I learned everything.  I learned to read books and RSS feeds, and I figured out which programs are better and more convenient for this and how to put them.  I learned how to keep a diary so that I don‚Äôt forget anything, I got a dictionary, ICQ, a player with scrobbling on last.fm, I learned how to use GPS and a map so as not to waste tons of traffic.  Well, toys, of course! <br><br>  For my own convenience, as well as for the convenience of the same, as I once, novice users of smartphones on androids, I created the site <a href="http://www.droidnews.ru/">www.droidnews.ru</a> .  He tried to collect all the most necessary, useful and tasty and streamlined so that everyone who has the device, the Internet, hands and at least the basic skills of pressing the buttons, could easily and painlessly turn your phone into a truly functional device. <br><br>  The site is designed as a blog (albeit, intensive work is underway on writing its highly specialized and optimized engine for it) with the author's reviews of the existing Android OS software, rare (so far) news about this system and various helpful tips for beginners, with the ability to add comments , on the development of which <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/zlbb/" class="user_link">zlbb</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/teutonick/" class="user_link">Teutonick</a> are currently working.  Most often these are questions that are asked when something is incomprehensible.  We try to respond to everything, remembering how we once sat indecisively on the floor and not knowing what to do next. <br><br>  If you need to explain something - please contact, I will do it with pleasure. <br><br>  Well, no ... Then just come to visit!  We will be glad to see you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88801/</a></p>
