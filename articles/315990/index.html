  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nothing extra. Best of Theory of Constraints</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello.  We produce metal products.  Stamping, welding, painting, packaging.  A year ago, I became acquainted with the ‚ÄúTheory of Constraints‚Äù (hereinafter TOC).  And he tried to imagine how a theory from books can be put into practice.  Trees, diagrams, clouds and other terms of this doctrine did not fit into the Russian mentality of the production worker.  Why Russian?  Because in Russia, all the methods (TOC, ‚ÄúLean Production‚Äù, etc.) are poorly taken root at the enterprises.  And do not say that there are successful projects.  Yes, they are.  But the lower the employee‚Äôs rank is, the worse his attitude towards these innovations.  Below is worse.  The fact is that such an employee does not see the picture as a whole.  Yes, and he does not need.  Not his concern.  They said the cards are glued to the box, which means we will be glued, otherwise the prizes will be deprived.  The task of a competent leader is to take something very valuable from each theory.  What can be applied using simple algorithms and calculation methods. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, I liked the TOC.  But from it I took only those positions that are easily transferred to the production reality.  Buffer, color scheme, management by MTO and MTA (production to order and to ensure availability), etc.  - this is what is ideally possible to operate in a production environment.  And clouds, trees and other natural phenomena badly take root in the heads of employees.  It seems to me that the cloud of definitions and metaphors interferes, blocks the work of the already clumsy mind of the average employee.  Clever is not necessary, but stupid will not help.  One thing to remember here.  There are wonderful words in Ain Rand's Atlas Shrugged.  In a brief retelling, they sound like this: ‚ÄúThere are no contradictions in the world.  If it seems to you that you are faced with a contradiction, check the source data, there is an error in them. ‚Äù  Everything!  This is all you need to learn.  Should work, but does not work, check the source data.  Common sense to help you.  And you can build clouds and trees, inject and continue to confuse employees. <br><br>  So, how do we translate theory into algorithms?  Started with software.  We wrote and write so far.  Use excel to embody a beautiful theory - catch butterflies with a fishing net.  Although, if you expand your staff and hire a cell filling officer, office is your option.  Everything should be automated immediately, so as not to alter. <br><br><h3>  MTO (custom production) </h3><br>  Managers take and place an order in the production plan (MTO).  The program calculates the percentage of completion depending on the filling of the warehouse and scatters the warehouse on orders depending on the date of shipment, priority and quantity.  The storekeeper daily enters data in the database about receipts from production, from a computer or from a phone (android application) through a barcode.  By the way, we are moving away from the stationary workplace of the stockman.  The reason - errors when entering the warehouse.  Made one, brought another.  Error in one click affects the operation of the system.  In the case of the phone and the barcode, this problem was minimized.  The storekeeper scans the box directly from the temporary storage area and in one click enters the base.

In the picture below, this is represented as a widget for the desktop, the graph shows the percentage of red-black orders.  According to theory, they should not be more than 10%.  As you can see, we have something to work on. <br><br>  MTO widget for desktop: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5cd/a22/f03/5cda22f0361044b38a7e35c5dd91c603.PNG"></div><br>  You can see which products are most often in the red-black zone.  And they pay special attention (in the season to keep a larger amount in stock).  For example, product K11.7 (500/120) for 22 days fell into this zone 7 times.  Therefore, we go to the production and think about how to fix it. <br><br>  Statistics hit in the red and black zone: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/608/ed5/418/608ed5418b9948579cd991b628fca3fc.PNG"></div><br>  Database for buffers for each day: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11a/22c/43f/11a22c43f6304f919bf227410b16949d.PNG"></div><br>  Next time, I‚Äôll tell you about the implementation of our MTA (production for availability) mechanism. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315990/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315990/</a></p>
