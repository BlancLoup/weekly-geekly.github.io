According to the analyst company Localytics, a week after the global release of the Galaxy S5 was 0.7% of all active Android devices in the world. <br><br>  Localytics <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2014/04/22/localytics-samsung-galaxy-s5-first-week-sales-similar-to-iphone-5s/">compares</a> device launches one week after launch.  At one time, the iPhone 5S reached 1.1% of all iPhone devices.  Localytics says that there are much more Android devices on the market than the iPhone, which is why the Galaxy S5 figures look very impressive.

      64% of the new Galaxy S5 are in the USA and 23% in Europe.  And if you look at the Galaxy S4, then at the moment 51% of them are in the USA and another 28% are in Europe.  It is assumed that the proportion of S5 in Europe will grow.  Now the device is not sold in all countries. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Unity Technologies officially opened a representative office in Russia </h4><br>  What we have previously reported has finally become a reality.  The developers of the very popular Unity cross-platform engine, the company of the same name, issued an official press release about the opening of an office in Russia.  We quote: <br><br><blockquote>  This step demonstrates the seriousness of the company's intentions in supporting a growing number of Russian developers using the Unity platform.  The office will be headed by Business Development Director Roman Menyakin and Marketing Director Natalya Sviridova. </blockquote><br>  Under the <a href="http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/%3Fu%3Dca494670d3e568680d6819006%26id%3Dc4e5b74145">link</a> you can learn more about the people who will head the Russian office of Unity.  We note that the company is planning to actively participate in the upcoming DevGamm event, where a whole ‚Äúbundle‚Äù of <a href="http://devgamm.com/moscow2014/conference/sessions/">reports</a> from different speakers from Unity is announced.  Come to the conference - we will be there too and will be happy to talk! <br><br><br><h4>  Mobile casinos earned $ 271.4 million in 3 months </h4><br>  Analytical company Eilers Research, specializing in the analysis of social casino niches, reported that mobile casinos account for 46% of the profits that social gambling earns. <br><br>  The top five companies making money on social casinos look like this: <br>  Caesars Interactive Entertainment - 17.8% <br>  IGT - 11.2% <br>  Zynga - 8.8% <br>  GSN - 8% <br>  Big Fish Games - 5.1% <br><br>  An interesting situation with the growth of income on mobile and Facebook.  If mobile casino revenues in the first quarter of this year increased by 13.8% compared with the previous three months, then the revenues of gambling on Facebook for the same period, on the contrary, fell by 0.8%. <br><br>  In total for the first quarter, all market participants earned $ 590 million. This is 5.5% more than in the last quarter of 2013.  According to Eilers Research, the social gambling market will grow to $ 2.6 billion a year. <br><br><br><h4>  Vietnam has suddenly become the fastest growing market for Apple. </h4><br>  Apple is experiencing a sales boom in Vietnam.  Reuters <a href="http://www.techinasia.com/vietnam-fastest-growth-in-vietnam/">noted</a> that in the first half of the year Apple‚Äôs sales in this country ... have tripled.  Sales growth is 5 times higher than the same period in India. <br><br>  This growth looks strange if you look at the country's economy.  The average income of a Vietnamese is $ 2,000, and the economic condition of Vietnam leaves much to be desired.  What is the reason for such growth?  The point is the mentality of the Vietnamese, who are willing to spend more than they can afford, on status things.  A Vietnamese will never believe that a person is successful if he does not ride a Mercedes.  For them, the brand is the clearest reflection of status.  The same with the smartphone, which is the most affordable luxury item, and besides, always in sight. <br><br>  In 2013, there were 7.6 million smartphones in Vietnam.  That is 89% more than the year before.  Apple's sales growth does not look so surprising for those familiar with the Vietnamese market.  It shows explosive growth with all that is somehow connected with the Internet and devices. <br><br>  In October 2012, Facebook reached 8.5 million users in Vietnam.  In March 2013 - 12 million. In January 2014, Facebook was used by 20 million people in the country.  Every month in Vietnam, 1 million new users are added to Facebook.  Given this growth rate, at the end of this year, there will be 30 million Facebook users in Vietnam.  The figure is impressive. <br><br><br><h4>  Japanese App Store is growing rapidly </h4><br>  The Japanese App Store is growing even faster than expected.  In March 2015, it <a href="http://pixelbits.wordpress.com/2014/04/09/japan-app-store-rapid-growth/">is planned</a> that # 10 in Top Ranks applications will earn about $ 17 million per month.  These are the same numbers for the # 2 application in Japan in November 2013. <br><br>  One of the reasons for this growth is that more than 30 percent of families in Japan consist of one person.  And this means that such people spend most of their income on entertainment, and not on family. <br><br>  This is facilitated by the fact that in Japan the population density is ten times higher than in the USA, and all these people have been used to spending money since the 90s with the help of mobile technologies and operators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/159/153/f5d/159153f5d0536120f4288f382c9fc351.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221425/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221425/</a></p>
