  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HyperX Fury - when you don‚Äôt have to choose between accuracy and speed</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the arrival of optical mice in our life, special working surfaces somehow lost much meaning.  The mouse travels normally and on the table, the cursor moves, what else do a simple office employee need?  Yes, and most home users normally sit with ordinary mice - and it works fine.  But when it comes to accurate cursor movement - working with graphics, 3D or banal games ... This is a completely different song. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f5/c1b/42c/0f5c1b42cf7d4cefa86737eabebad299.jpg"><br><br>  Over the past five to ten years, no particular evolution has occurred in soft carpets.  In part, there is nothing to invent.  I took a rubber backing, put a rag on it, drew a print to please the eye, ready.  With hard everything is a bit more interesting, but of all my acquaintances (I interviewed 30 people, no less), two people use hard carpets from one black and green company.  Well, I used it for quite a long time, until I was tired of its eternally cold surface due to a light draft.  Actually, today I will try to tell you about the carpets, some of the technologies used in the production, interesting and nuanced.  Without excess water and in fact, and even with examples. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#d52339">Mouse pad?</font>  <font color="#d52339">What's so complicated! ..</font> </h2><br>  Hehe.  There is a lot of difficult.  Let's start with logical reasoning.  You need to create a surface that will be well read by an optical or laser sensor.  With a laser, everything is more or less clear, and so in most cases he doesn‚Äôt care about the surface, just to get caught in the IR range.  The optical mouse of the classic design, working with the LED of the visible spectrum, many times per second (more than 1000 in top variants) "photographs" the surface and calculates the displacement.

    <h4>  Theory </h4><br>  As you understand, in order to facilitate the task of analyzing a picture by a sensor, the surface must be sufficiently contrast.  Using black and white threads is, of course, a good idea, but we have an LED that illuminates the surface at an angle, which means enough relief for the fabric itself - it will cast a shadow that the sensor sees, and the threads themselves are not perfectly smooth. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/152/330/ef6/152330ef69fc3921b2a942a55c0dd7bf.png" width="400"></div><br><br><blockquote>  <b>Note</b>  <b>of the author:</b> about what an optical mouse sees, how to assemble one‚Äôs own and what can come out of it, I recommend reading in the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/ig0lka/" class="user_link">iG0Lka</a> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/258184/">post</a> ‚ÄúHow I Made a W-Mouse - A Gaming Mouse with Unique Abilities‚Äù. <br></blockquote><br><br><h4>  Get into the binding </h4><br>  In order for the pattern to be sufficiently contrasting, you will need either a relief weave or relatively thick threads.  Both the first and second reduces the smoothness of the surface: firstly, it will collect dirt and grease from hands that are somehow present on them, and secondly, the relief will reduce the quality of the mouse's sliding on the surface.  Carpets of the ‚Äúcontrol‚Äù class, on which the accuracy of movement is put at the forefront, and the speed of the secondary is distinguished either by rough weaving or by special perforation / special surface.  Some mice are generally calibrated for a specific surface and adjust the backlight / contrast settings of the image to work perfectly with a specific texture. <br><br><h4>  Some materials science </h4><br>  Now as for the threads themselves.  Smooth synthetic materials are good because they are resistant to abrasion, do not absorb contamination, wash easily and do not rattle around the edges - usually the surface is simply melted with a hot knife when cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fe6/ac1/3a5/fe6ac13a528459f26306fe34b1751690.jpg"><br><br>  Natural threads are more pleasant tactile, more suitable for control korivik, but they can wear out, stick with fringe around the edges, and spilled coffee almost 100% will leave a stain that will have to be washed.  However, there are also difficulties with washing - it is not known what will happen to the base, whether the threads will come off the fabric, the fabric itself does not crawl off the temperature - the expansion coefficients of the base, adhesive layer and threads may differ. <br><br>  In general, even a cursory analysis gives us a bunch of nuances with you, which should be taken into account when designing such a simple thing as a carpet.  But there are still different thicknesses, base materials, adhesion to the table ... It is necessary to ensure uniform tension of the fabric and no distortions when transferring it to the base, to make the drawing (if there is one at all) does not affect the quality of the sensor. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d52339">HyperX Carpets</font> </h2><br>  Yes, there are.  The guys tightly took up the periphery.  First, a very successful line of combat headsets.  Then - extremely simple and reliable mechanical keyboard without excesses.  And now - the same polished working surfaces for mice, to which few people have any complaints.  Regardless of the size you get the same accessory quality. <br><br>  Let's start with the basics.  That is, from the substrate.  The manufacturer claims as a real rubber material.  I don‚Äôt know if this is so, I didn‚Äôt carry out chemical analysis, but the smell ... Here are some new good sneakers that smell the same.  Obtrusive this "flavor" is not called, it disappears in a couple of hours, but the smell is just that characteristic.  The material itself is foamed, textured, soft, but very dense.  Under the weight of the arms and mouse, the carpet practically does not bend, it does not move around the table without your desire, it reliably blocks small surface defects. <br><br>  Now go to the work surface.  Visually - the usual "rag", smooth, shiny, with a small logo print in the lower right corner.  The feeling of working with a mouse is a ‚Äúfast‚Äù carpet, with a light and long slip, the mouse does not slow down (I tried four different variants of rodents), the sensor clings to the surface perfectly.  Accuracy cannot be called surgical, but for such a ‚Äúspeedy‚Äù rug with a smooth surface it is simply wonderful.  Everything is interesting, as usual, inside.  Here is a super macro shot of weave.  Nothing confuses? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/81e/931/560/81e931560d635097e83c50c5a7fb686b.jpg"><br><br>  For comparison - from another well-known manufacturer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cdf/f0d/02f/cdff0d02fd1cd5f19af51f63eedd6799.jpg"><br><br>  Now the difference is visible?  If the other manufacturer uses the classic weave ‚Äúmatting‚Äù (two warp threads through two weft yarns), which creates an ordinary durable, but coarse fabric, then the HyperX developers went much further.  Their surface is not woven, but ... knitted.  That is, the carpet - a distant relative of your favorite sweaters with deer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef2/5d0/c29/ef25d0c29db05f87bddf3d7d36189499.jpg"><br><br>  Knitted fabrics consist of a set of intersecting loops.  There are a lot of kinds of different interweaving - which, specifically, is used here, unfortunately, I cannot say.  Common elements of loops can be discerned, and what's inside and where they go in the lower layer - go and figure it out. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/afb/048/3eb/afb0483eb6443e6f075cef4969f01367.png"></div><br><br>  For us, the main difference between such a coating and a classic fabric is that the loops have some mobility relative to each other, which means that the carpet can stretch and shrink without consequences.  If you look at the micrograph more closely, you will see that the bottom surface of the loop part is literally melted into a rubber base. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d92/6c1/ec7/d926c1ec77349c5095a8c6b751b73078.jpg"><br><br>  That is, the carpet under the weight of the mouse, if pressed, is extremely evenly without testing the strength of the work surface to the base. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d52339">Feelings from work</font> </h2><br>  I had a lot of different rugs, from super-control to matte glass and metal.  All of them are felt differently, work differently and generally behave differently under the mouse.  Soft and thick carpets are burned by the mouse, which increases friction and control.  Hard (but control) take their rough surface and clear pattern, which clings to the sensor.  Intermediate and fast carpets can be very slippery or have a special weave ... In general, there are millions of nuances.  Up to the fact that some carpets work much better in one of the planes: for example, horizontally.  In some shooters, this is convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/de6/cf4/549/de6cf454991e3b01d1166a625a80758c.jpg"><br><br>  HyperX Fury is a hybrid of the best sides of "fast" and "exact" carpets.  Smooth synthetic loops provide a stunning glide, completely symmetrical, even, I would say, a little "sticky."  The mouse seems to be smeared with something, does not lag behind the surface and easily starts moving.  Since the carpet is without drawings and prints in the workspace, 99% of the sensors will work with it without any problems.  Tracking is very uniform, without jerks and sudden accelerations.  Checked both on mice with an optical sensor, and on laser models: SS Sensei, Asus Gladius, MadCatz RAT 7 and Razer Mamba (the very first, with another 5600 DPI-sensor) work fine.  Do you think that a mouse for 5-10 thousand rubles can not work "badly" or twitch?  Use SS Sensei with a Razer eXactmat Xcontrol metal carpet.  Terrible jerks and delays are provided to you. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d52339">Personal opinion</font> </h2><br>  I'm not a big fan of fabric carpets of such thickness.  Usually they are soft, strongly bend and quickly get dirty.  HyperX somehow solved all three problems.  The smaller volume of pores and air ‚Äúbubbles‚Äù at the base made it dense and elastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a6d/871/f9d/a6d871f9d1875da2226d36cb7e29c78a.jpg"><br><br>  The special interlacing allows to work without problems even with capricious mice, provides excellent control of the cursor with a good speed of the mouse movement.  The very fact of using knitted fabric, rather than fabric, already speaks volumes.  Carpet easily undergoes deformation, carrying, washing, and generally looks made for ages.  I liked the capricious and spoiled user.  And this is something, but worth it.  Now we come to the most interesting.  Sizes and prices. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d52339">How much and how much</font> </h2><br>  There are three carpet versions available in the Russian Federation: M (36 * 30 centimeters), L (50 * 42 cm) and XL (90 * 42 cm).  For you to understand: the XL size is enough to wrap a 15-inch MacBook in two layers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab3/d42/2a5/ab3d422a5a34ba2257ff5674581b1354.jpg"><br><br>  That is, they can cover the entire table, put the keyboard and mouse on it, and enjoy a flat, uniform surface.  Well, the great thing about these carpets is that with all the positive qualities set, the price tag is just super-democratic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15f/900/dad/15f900dad972ff8fc3b25765d08c046f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>HyperX Fury Pro Carpets are available on DNS:</b> <br>  Kingston HyperX Fury M (36 * 30) - <a href="http://www.dns-shop.ru/product/6468317d9c7c3361/kovrik-kingston-hyperx-fury-pro-m/">790 rubles</a> <br>  Kingston HyperX Fury L (50 * 42) - <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesMousepadFuryL">1,250 rubles</a> <br>  Kingston HyperX Fury XL (90 * 42) - <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesMousepadfury">1 990 rubles</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ba/edd/776/2baedd776238bce00dd6b00ddf2481d1.jpg"><br><br>  And we are damn, incredibly happy to communicate with like-minded people in our blog and intend to give high-quality Kingston hardware to our subscribers.
