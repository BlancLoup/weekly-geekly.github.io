As a result, some young people believe that they can leave the university at any time and launch a successful IT startup.  There are those who simply do not want to go to the university, believing that you need to immediately get a job as an intern, learning the tricks of programming as needed.  But the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE">effect of the survivor is</a> supported by isolated successful examples. <br><br>  In these judgments there is a certain proportion of youthful maximalism, and perhaps even a juggling of facts.  There are different opinions on this, everyone has their own experience.  And if you look at it, the very role of higher education institutions can be interpreted differently.  Someone thinks, for example, that they must almost certainly be business incubators.

      We talked to representatives of Russian companies and asked them to express their attitude about what is happening with Russian IT education today, as far as it corresponds to market realities.  We also found out who they prefer when applying for a job and much more. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We asked the experts the following questions: <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319342/">‚Ä¢ How important is it for you that an IT specialist has a specialized higher education?</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319342/">Do these requirements differ in relation to programmers of various directions, system administrators and other categories of developers?</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319342/">‚Ä¢ In your experience, how well does the quality of higher IT education correspond to the current demands of the Russian market?</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319342/">‚Ä¢ How willingly do self-taught people take on the good positions of IT specialists in ‚Äúserious‚Äù companies?</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319342/">‚Ä¢ What can you advise high school students and first-year students who want to connect their lives with IT in terms of education?</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319342/">When will you recommend getting two higher education?</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319342/">In what cases can be limited to a college in an IT area and a higher education not related to IT?</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319342/">‚Ä¢ What other effective options can you recommend?</a>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319342/">What kind of education could have "computer scientists" who could fit perfectly into your (perhaps, not related to IT) company?</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319342/">‚Ä¢ To what extent, in your opinion, personality factors (upbringing, character) play a role in getting an education by a young man and his further employment, in addition to the skills acquired during training?</a> <br><br><blockquote><h5><a name="1"></a>  How important is it for you that an IT specialist has a specialized higher education?  Do these requirements differ in relation to programmers of various directions, system administrators and other categories of developers? </h5></blockquote><br><h4>  Alexey Galchenko, Technical Director and Head of Development, MediaNation Advertising Agency: </h4><br>  When applying for a job, we primarily look at how candidates perform test tasks, paying great attention to the optimization and security of their decision.  Education is secondary, as most IT professionals are for the most part self-taught.  If a candidate has a physical mathematics or natural science education, this only tells us that he is capable of thinking critically and solving the tasks set for him. <br><br><h4>  Vladimir Simonov, Head of Development, 1C and BOSS-HRD BDO Unicon Outsourcing: </h4><br>  By experience, I can say that we take programmers from a variety of universities.  And not necessarily in the diploma of the applicant must appear "programmer" or "faculty of automation and computer technology."  And in general - it is better to distinguish between a diploma and the presence of skills.  For us, it‚Äôs important to have a certain amount of knowledge in the field of mathematics, IT systems architecture, for a programmer we need skills of object-oriented programming. <br><br>  The presence of higher education is certainly very desirable.  Ideally, students at an institute should be taught not so much the amount of specific knowledge as the ability to learn independently, always be in search of knowledge, non-standard solutions, critical thinking skills (although, unfortunately, this is not always the case).  And it is precisely this that a specialist with a higher education is valuable. <br><br>  Requirements for programmers and system administrators, of course, differ, but not fundamentally.  But if we talk about business analysts, project managers - here IT education is not strictly necessary.  I know many brilliant professionals who have an economic and financial education, and they lacked the knowledge in the field of IT from refresher courses. <br><br><h4>  Alsou Glinskaya, Human Resources Director, ICL Services: </h4><br>  Almost no matter what.  Although in fact it often turns out that the employee has a specialized higher education, but this is not the result of the selection based on the principle of having this education, but rather the opposite, education has determined the direction for a career. <br><br><h4>  Anna Belova, managing partner of Devar Group, a leading Russian project producer with the use of augmented reality technologies (AR, Augmented Reality): </h4><br>  As they say, they are met according to their clothes ‚Äî so they meet an employee ‚Äúby education‚Äù.  Then, in the case of an experienced manager, deep questions are included, and then an analysis of what the employee actually knows how to do.  Such an attitude is found not so much in relation to programmers, as in the depth of each individual direction.  At the initial level, an institute basis is also sufficient.  At higher levels, the ability to self-learn in the course of work already plays a leading role. <br><br><h4>  Pavel Krasavtsev, CEO of iBrush production company: </h4><br>  Earlier in all vacancies we wrote that higher education is not necessary.  But what about, history knows unique people who do not have it.  Now we require higher education, but we don‚Äôt care about what specialty and what university.  It is believed that if a person could (at least for a tick) go through all student litigation, then this is already something.  Otherwise there was a too large percentage of inadequate guys. <br><br>  As for the profile, then everything is simple: we are engaged in design, engineering and development.  We do not have a decent university, which at least offered something sane on this score offered to applicants.  It does not concern us.  The guys acquire all the skills and become specialists already in the process of work - not at all in high school.  But this does not apply to sysadmins and managers.  For these positions, specialized education can play into the hands: they will not give knowledge at the university, but they will help to form a circle of contacts and interests. <br><br><h4>  Pavel Syrtlanov, Technical Director, Professional Hosting Provider .masterhost: </h4><br>  The presence of a specialized higher education from an IT specialist is an absolute advantage when applying for a job, especially for positions that require analytical thinking and work with highly loaded systems.  Such requirements exist in senior positions, timlidov in the field of system administration, programming. <br><br>  However, an important point is the knowledge base of specialist, specific skills.  If they are, and higher education is not profile - it is necessary to approach the person individually.  The presence of higher education in the applicant in general gives the employer an understanding of what a person is able to learn. <br><br><h4>  Andrei Volosyuk, Technical Director, Digital Society Laboratory, SocialKey Ads product: </h4><br>  In most cases, for me it does not matter whether the developer or the system administrator has a specialized education.  More important is the experience of the candidate: the companies in which he worked, the tasks that he performed, the relevance of his experience for our field.  Profile higher education, of course, is a plus, if the applicant is a graduate of one of the top universities - Moscow State University, Moscow State Technical University.  Bauman, MIPT, partly MAI.  If there is a vacancy of an architect or systems analyst, education will be a priority, but again, not decisive.  His absence can more than compensate for his extensive work experience. <br><br><h4>  Alexey Lykov, technical director of Playkey: </h4><br>  The presence of higher education is of fundamental importance, but, as experience shows, with higher education, people have a wider outlook, a more comprehensive approach to the problem.  Of course, there is a difference in the university, there are reputable universities and even departments, graduates from which, we can say with certainty, will not let you down.  For example, for me this is at least the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics of Perm State National Research University, which I myself graduated from.  I can say with confidence that the hackers do not reach the end there.  I remember in the first year the dean said that only 40% of you will graduate.  "How so?", - I thought ... But it turned out to be true.  At the graduation, as a result, approximately 60-70% were missed. <br><br>  As for administrators, experience is more important here, since it is not specifically taught to the administrator, then the desire and passion of the person for administration is important. <br><br>  It is even more difficult with testers: they do not specifically teach testing, we only had a few general courses, so we either take the ‚Äúgreens‚Äù at Playkey, we can do it without education, and we learn, or with already gained experience. <br><br><h4>  Alexander Yurov, deputy director, co-founder of Fogsoft / iTender: </h4><br>  To become a truly excellent programmer, it is not enough to know a programming language.  It is important to have a basic knowledge of programming and to understand how it works.  It is necessary to know the algorithms, to be able to work with databases and most importantly - to learn how to think objectively.  To do this, universities study such subjects as mathematical analysis, differential equations, the basics of object-oriented programming. Therefore, a specialized higher education is definitely needed.  Moreover, it is important that the programmer has a higher education of a high-quality university, which gives him fundamental knowledge and a broad outlook.  The university is still a good brain. <br><br>  Requirements for specialists in different directions can not be the same.  If a programmer works with business applications, it is necessary that he knows economics and accounting.  If you create systems that automate processes in the enterprise, it is important to understand the processes in the enterprise.  If it works with applications that are associated with robotization and iron, then you cannot do without in-depth knowledge of physics.  These are all fundamental things. <br><br><h4>  Kirill Medvedev, HR Director of SearchInform: </h4><br>  We, naturally, pay attention to the education column in the resume, but this is not decisive.  First of all, we look at the work experience, give a test task and, based on the results of its implementation, make a decision.  If the candidate is ‚Äúself-taught,‚Äù but he correctly executed the test and it is clear from him that he owns the technologies we need, we will be happy to invite an employee to the team. <br><br><h4>  Nikolay Patskov, Director General of ‚ÄúFreshDoc.ru Document Designer‚Äù: </h4><br>  It is important for us that the specialist has excellent specialized skills, conflict-free and ability to work in a pair or a team and strive to develop and learn new things.  Unfortunately, today higher education cannot guarantee any of the above points.  Successfully implemented projects in the portfolio, the ability to show oneself ‚Äúat the blackboard‚Äù and information (preferably recommendations) from previous employers, will be a much greater advantage than a diploma from a well-known university. <br><br><blockquote><h5><a name="2"></a>  How does the quality of higher IT education on average, in your experience, correspond to the modern demands of the Russian market? </h5></blockquote><br><h4>  Alexey Galchenko, MediaNation: </h4><br>  Basic IT education in Russia is at a fairly high level.  Until now, the Faculty of Moscow State University can meet teachers who require students to meet when writing a curriculum in 8 Kb.  This is not necessary now, because unlimited resources are available.  But working on the optimization of the solution, the student learns to solve the problem without excessive consumption of resources. <br><br><h4>  Vladimir Simonov, Head of Development, 1C and BOSS-HRD BDO Unicon Outsourcing: </h4><br>  Not quite consistent.  Basic knowledge and technology, which in the modern world is rapidly becoming obsolete, is often taught at institutes.  And not because the institutions are bad, but because the sphere is developing too fast, for 5 years of training, technologies can change a lot. <br>  Companies, as a rule, have to either organize additional training or take such specialists as trainees. <br><br><h4>  Anna Belova, managing partner of Devar Group, a leading Russian project producer with the use of augmented reality technologies (AR, Augmented Reality): </h4><br>  The IT industry is changing very quickly and, unfortunately, modern education simply does not have time to keep up with it.  For example, when we urgently needed the addition of qualified employees, we decided to go to the top and immediately hire teachers from universities and institutes.  The disappointment was that in practice they were absolutely equal to our junior programmers (entry level).  That is, they could talk for hours, but in practice they showed far from the required level of working dynamics. <br><br><h4>  Pavel Krasavtsev, CEO of iBrush production company: </h4><br>  The quality of higher IT education does not correspond to the market at all.  As mentioned earlier, most IT professionals become professionals in the process. <br><br>  There are two problems, in my opinion: <br><br><ul><li>  Successful IT professionals do not go to universities.  Consequently, those who are actually very far from the market and business teach. </li><li>  Projects that are carried out within the framework of training are very far from reality.  There is no ‚Äúclient‚Äù, there is no management (negotiations, risks, expectations), there is no change in requirements after the start of work, there are generally 80% of the factors that influence an IT project in market conditions. </li></ul><br><h4>  Pavel Syrtlanov, Technical Director, Professional Hosting Provider .masterhost: </h4><br>  In our experience, leading universities in the country prepare IT professionals satisfactorily.  It is rather related to the areas of system administration and programming, while specialists in the field of network engineering after high school are much more difficult to find.  In such a situation, we draw attention to applicants with additional certificates who have completed private courses, for example, from Cisco. <br><br><h4>  Andrei Volosyuk, Technical Director, Digital Society Laboratory, SocialKey Ads product: </h4><br>  In my experience, IT education in our country does not match the realities of the market.  Unfortunately, most universities do not teach the languages, approaches and methodologies that are currently being used.  Graduates have a base, the quality of which depends on the university, but it is almost impossible to put into practice without applied knowledge.  Therefore, companies such as Mail.Ru and Yandex are investing in additional education for students, launching their projects - for example, Technopark at Moscow State Technical University.  Bauman and others.  They take the most capable students and teach them the technologies and methodologies that are used in the real world.  Thanks to this approach, specialists appear who are really ready to solve practical problems and are in demand in the market. <br><br><h4>  Alexander Yurov, deputy director, co-founder of Fogsoft / iTender: </h4><br>  Generally does not match.  Still, students who graduate from the university are not ready today to participate in serious development without prior training within the company.  I would like the universities to produce ready-made specialists.  The experience at Stanford and Cambridge is successful, where in the second year students start small start-ups and show how the business works from the inside. <br><br>  It turns out that by the sixth year, after graduating from the magistracy, the students had already worked in the company.  In addition, it is extremely important that they have already directly tried to interact with the end customer.  I am sure that every programmer in the company should understand how communication with the client goes, what customers need and how their business works, and not just develop. <br><br><blockquote><h5><a name="3"></a>  How willingly do self-taught people take on the good positions of IT specialists in ‚Äúserious‚Äù companies? </h5></blockquote><br><h4>  Alexey Galchenko, MediaNation: </h4><br>  We had experience with one of the leaders in the implementation of Oracle solutions.  The CIO was faced with a difficult situation: either not accepting an employee after completing the probationary period due to the lack of higher education, or working with him, violating company regulations.  As a result, the solution turned out to be simple: they sent a specialist to study at the correspondence department of the Moscow State Technical University.  Bauman.  Conclusion: if a specialist is important - they will take it. <br><br><h4>  Vladimir Simonov, Head of Development, 1C and BOSS-HRD BDO Unicon Outsourcing: </h4><br>  To answer this question, you need to understand what we mean when we say ‚Äúself-taught‚Äù.  If this is a person who does not have a specialized education at all and has gained all his knowledge only through his own experience, then, of course, he will not be taken to a serious position in a large company.  There are, of course, unique cases, but they are so rare that now there is no sense in them to go deeper.  Profile education provides not only knowledge of technology, but, above all, an understanding of what a business is in general, how it works, and general erudition. <br><br>  If we are talking about self-taught as a person who graduated from a non-profile, but technical college, is interested in programming, independently acquires knowledge, then it is these experts who are valued.  Because, as I already said, having a diploma does not guarantee the knowledge and skills that are required not in theory, but in practice.  An IT professional must be ready to learn all the time. <br><br><h4>  Anna Belova, managing partner of Devar Group, a leading Russian project producer with the use of augmented reality technologies (AR, Augmented Reality): </h4><br>  In my experience, everything is decided in the modern world by a well-executed test task.  Diploma and resume - this is a good suit to enter for an interview.  Excellent, non-standard and quickly completed test task - club card. <br><br><h4>  Pavel Syrtlanov, Technical Director, Professional Hosting Provider .masterhost: </h4><br>  It is difficult to say how it happens in other serious companies.  At .masterhost, we try not to lose such applicants, but to take up our initial positions in a particular IT field.  Obviously, we need to see some potential in a person, so that, having invested time and energy in his training, we end up with a ready-made high-quality IT specialist.  Our departmental structure and streamlined process of learning allow us to advance from a specialist to the top executive positions in IT. <br><br><h4>  Andrei Volosyuk, Technical Director, Digital Society Laboratory, SocialKey Ads product: </h4><br>  In serious IT companies, the lack of higher education is not a blocking factor in hiring.  Of course, the higher the position, the more factors play a role, and the presence of higher education, MBA, certificates may be of greater importance.  At the same time, in companies for which IT is not the main business, formal requirements for higher education may be necessary.  But this rather speaks of a lack of understanding of the specifics of IT and IT education in our country. <br><br><h4>  Kirill Medvedev, HR Director of SearchInform: </h4><br>  We take willingly if the candidate has famously executed the test.  But the more a company is bureaucratized, the more it follows formal rules.  There are organizations where you will never become a department head if you do not have a higher education.  In our company, we focus not on the ‚Äúcrust‚Äù, but on the knowledge and background of the candidate. <br><br><blockquote><h5><a name="4"></a>  What can you advise high school students and first-year students who want to connect their lives with IT in terms of education?  When will you recommend getting two higher education? </h5></blockquote><br><h4>  Alexey Galchenko, MediaNation: </h4><br>  I would advise to develop, to read such authors as D. Knut, E. Oram and so on, to study the development of high-loaded systems and higher mathematics.  If you plan over time to move away from ‚Äúpure‚Äù programming to the managerial sphere related to programming, then you need to get an education in management and economics in order to understand certain business processes that you will have to work with later. <br><br><h4>  Anna Belova, managing partner of Devar Group, a leading Russian project producer with the use of augmented reality technologies (AR, Augmented Reality): </h4><br>  One advice: try to really understand what you like to do and what you enjoy in terms of self-realization.  This is the most difficult thing in the modern world, where there are so many distractions and extraneous opinions around.  In the course of educational activities, you can look at all the exhibits, as in a gallery, but choose one for yourself.  The sooner this happens, the sooner you can concentrate on the chosen direction.  This will help in the course of internships and self-education to truly "gain strength." <br><br>  It is not important to complete the education itself.  It is important to be able to do what you like.  The world of today is a world of abundance and opportunities to choose what is closer to the soul.  Realize, choose and concentrate.  This is definitely a path to success. <br><br><h4>  Alsou Glinskaya, Human Resources Director, ICL Services: </h4><br>  In my case, the two higher ones turned out at the same time because one is for the soul, the other for the profession I was planning to work on.  It happens that for the second higher they decide to change something in their life, or, like some of my classmates, to recall their youth and student years.  It is useful if these two of your higher complement each other. <br><br>  I will not recommend something specific.  But I advise you to think hard why you need a second higher education.  Of course, sometime later it will warm the soul and will be appreciated in very narrow circles.  But getting two higher to be a professional in different areas is a worthless undertaking.  Higher education is not about the profession.  About the general duty, outlook, functional literacy, but not about the applied knowledge and skills necessary to work in the future. <br><br>  By and large, to change the profession, it is enough to get the right knowledge and not necessarily in high school. <br><br><h4>  Polina Khabarova, Deputy Director General for Human Resources at CROC: </h4><br>  Profile IT education is not a guarantee of success in work.  High school students and students who want to connect life with IT, you need to try to quickly learn about the future profession, immersed in the topic.  Now there is a mass of educational activities that are held by industry companies.  At such meetings, you can chat with profile experts and find like-minded people among peers. <br><br>  At CRIC, for example, the IT Solutions School takes place every year - for several months, under the guidance of experts and tutoring participants get a real working experience of this IT specialist, implement team projects aimed at solving real problems of the school using information technologies.  At the end of the program, successful solutions get a start in life and bring real benefits to schools. <br><br><h4>  Pavel Krasavtsev, CEO of iBrush production company: </h4><br>  You need to start not in the first year, when you are already a student, but much earlier.  All successful IT people started picking their equipment from a young age.  The main thing - it should like and not burden.  Then the hobby will later grow into a beloved profession, and everything will be fine. <br><br>  I would advise parents here before it is too late: do not restrict children to use a computer.  Sooner or later, the child will play games and install turbo pascal. <br><br><h4>  Andrei Volosyuk, Technical Director, Digital Society Laboratory, SocialKey Ads product: </h4><br>  Trite, but I would recommend that students strive to enroll in top universities.  In addition, try to get into the educational IT programs of large companies.  In addition to a good basic education, you will receive relevant practical skills, as well as the opportunity to train and subsequently work in advanced IT companies. <br><br>  I would also advise you not to forget about self-education, to follow new technologies - to try, experiment, read specialized literature and attend conferences, trainings, take courses on educational resources, for example, Coursera.  In general, keep abreast of what is now relevant and in demand in the IT market.  However, this advice applies not only to students, but also to any industry professionals. <br><br><h4>  Alexey Lykov, technical director of Playkey: </h4><br>  First, you should like the IT industry: only by doing your favorite thing, you can achieve something.  Secondly, these are personal qualities, purposefulness, responsibility, the ability to get to the bottom of the problem. <br><br>  And I wish the guys to read more books, they have hidden the age-old wisdom of the smartest people on the planet.  This way is much better and more efficient than stuffing these bumps on your own. <br><br>  Getting a second education is clear to me in two cases.  First: when an uninteresting first was chosen - it happens at the age of 18, you do not understand what you want.  Second: I want to start related things - management, marketing, or the legal sphere.  Although in the world of modern technology, all knowledge can be drawn from the Internet - there would be a desire. <br><br><h4>  Nikolay Patskov, Director General, ‚ÄúFreshDoc.ru Document Designer‚Äù: </h4><br>  First and foremost: if after graduating from college or a technical school you seriously think about getting a higher education, the option ‚Äúwork + correspondence education‚Äù will be much more useful and more interesting than ‚Äúfull-time education + student life‚Äù. <br><br>  To learn and translate knowledge into practice is a must.  This option will help to immediately check the information "in the fields", as well as to ask the teachers really the right practical questions.  So, if you can, think about job placement as soon as possible. <br><br>  The second thing I would like to focus on is the choice of a specialty.  Think about what would be to your liking, with what would you like to associate your career?  Forget about prestige and high pay, every day to engage in a hated business will not work under any preferences.  The IT industry is wide and multifaceted, determine your favorite business and follow the intended path.  Successes! <br><br><blockquote><h5>  In what cases can be limited to a college in an IT area and a higher education not related to IT? </h5></blockquote><br><h4>  Alexey Galchenko, MediaNation: </h4><br>  You can not put in a single line of college in the IT area and higher education, not related to IT.  IT College already sets a certain vector of movement of thoughts, which can be developed, studying in the university at the faculties related to IT direction.  But higher education is not related to IT - here the question is somewhat broader than it seems at the beginning.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we are talking about filfak, then this area is in no way connected with IT, and it can be problematic for people to move into this area. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If we are talking about natural sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, medicine), then it will be much easier for specialists in these areas: they have been taught to analyze large amounts of information, to search for optimal solutions for various tasks.</font></font><br><br><blockquote><h5><a name="5"></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What other effective options can you advise? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">What kind of education could have "computer scientists" who could fit perfectly into your (perhaps, not related to IT) company?</font></font></h5></blockquote><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Vladimir Simonov, Head of Development, 1C and BOSS-HRD BDO Unicon Outsourcing: </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I would advise starting from what the market is asking for. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Our company provides business process outsourcing services (accounting, personnel administration and payroll). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Accordingly, we will be happy to take a specialist who has already received knowledge, and better - some experience related to programming for 1C or ABAP. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are many training centers and open training programs that support the same 1C, Microsoft, Yandex - you can transfer for a long time. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You can be trained without even leaving your home. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">All possibilities of the applicant are limited only by his desire and aspiration.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Anna Belova, managing partner of Devar Group, a leading Russian project producer with the use of augmented reality technologies (AR, Augmented Reality): </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It would be correct to say "what competences should be possessed". It is competencies in the modern world that form the ‚Äúadded value‚Äù or value of an employee. For our company, in addition to competence, the ‚Äúpassion‚Äù is important, the passion for creation, the creation of a product from which you get the most pleasure in the course of work and in the course of receiving feedback from the end user. Everything in our world is emotions. If we experience positive emotions in the course of work, they will certainly be transformed into a product.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And if the team burns with such passion, then the value of the product is multiplied, and really rare, masterpieces are obtained. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Absolute sync is also important to us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We definitely see the edge of the future of technology. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We see what role we can play in it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We see how we can influence this future. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We need the same "reformers" in spirit. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Then together we can really do great things.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Alexey Lykov, technical director of Playkey: </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Love for team sports. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I loved to play basketball, volleyball and now I play regularly. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Still, the team can do synergistically more than people individually, this is clearly manifested in the work. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Lonely people are smart. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if they do not work in a team, then they simply become ineffective compared to everyone else.</font></font><br><br><blockquote><h5><a name="6"></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> In your opinion, to what extent do personal factors (upbringing, character) play a role in getting an education by a young man and his further employment, in addition to the skills acquired during training? </font></font></h5></blockquote><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Alexey Galchenko, MediaNation: </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Personality factors are no less important a matter than experience and skills. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, you can be an excellent specialist, but to be a man with whom it is impossible to work in a team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And maybe the opposite. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But this is all subjective. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I can not describe the template, under which programmers are suitable for MediaNation. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It cannot be said that we take in the company only experienced and cheerful people with an active lifestyle. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Each person is individual, and the task of the manager is to find the right approach to this employee and determine his role in the life of the company.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Vladimir Simonov, Head of Development, 1C and BOSS-HRD BDO Unicon Outsourcing: </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You need a desire to constantly learn, try yourself in new areas, improve yourself in them. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For any programmer, it is important to be diligent, attentive and even stress-resistant. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you are responsible, for example, for supporting the system that manages production, and because of some error, the conveyor stops, you need to have very strong nerves, so as not to panic and quickly find and fix the "bug." </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">System thinking is also very important. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, in order to grow in a company, to take a leadership position, the programmer will definitely need the skills to communicate with people, the ability to obtain information and manage the project.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Anna Belova, managing partner of Devar Group, a leading Russian project producer with the use of augmented reality technologies (AR, Augmented Reality): </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Education and character are the ‚Äúpillars‚Äù in getting an education and choosing a person‚Äôs life path. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After all, if the springboard is long, but not high, then fly far away with it is unlikely to come out. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As in the case if the springboard is too high and short. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, today the modern young man should be given the opportunity to try himself in different areas of business and science. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is necessary not to push him to thoughtlessly move in a given direction, but to give the right of choice. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A person must feel this inner desire, ‚Äúvoice‚Äù, to create or do something. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And then you need to move boldly in this direction.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Although today it‚Äôs not easy to follow a single chosen path. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Along with the instructions of others, a lot of distractions of modern times. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is easier to run through the clubs, hang out in computer games, watch TV shows and movies, and then, when there is no longer any energy for your own desires, all that remains is to listen to the people around you, go with the flow. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Listen to your inner voice and do not succumb to provocations, then everything will certainly work out.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Pavel Krasavtsev, CEO of iBrush production company: </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, the developers are quite complex guys. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Difficult in terms of communication, internal foundations, and so on. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not know, maybe something unites them (upbringing, character). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You have to be patient, be able to learn, be somewhat stubborn. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These qualities are necessary for a novice programmer, since </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">there is a whole ocean of knowledge ahead that you need to pass through yourself and learn how to apply. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Without this, your familiarity with the development market will end with ‚ÄúHello, World!‚Äù.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Andrei Volosyuk, Technical Director, Digital Society Laboratory, SocialKey Ads product: </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, a good education characterizes a person from the positive side. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Knowing which university a candidate has graduated from, I can judge his ability to work, his ability to overcome difficulties, to achieve his goals. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">These are the qualities that every employer wants to see in their employees. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But they must be supported by the necessary practical skills.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Kirill Medvedev, HR Director of SearchInform: </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I repeat: it is not the ‚Äúcrusts‚Äù that are important for us, but the desire to work and the ability to learn. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I would recommend to cultivate these qualities. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In our company, people who are willing to work for the result are valued. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Any organization values ‚Äã‚Äãemployee drive, the desire to do work better than it did yesterday, to develop and increase their own efficiency. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If these qualities are in the employee - it will be a valuable staff for the company.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Instead of output </font></font></h3><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Peter Krasnoshchekov, Head of the Information Technology Department of NPO GalileoSky LLC: </font></font></h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In my opinion, higher education for IT-specialists is definitely important. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, there are examples of self-taught professionals - it all depends on a person‚Äôs personal qualities, but this is a rare exception. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the same way, the presence of higher education in itself does not guarantee that a specialist is good. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, knowledge of the fundamental base, which gives a technical college, is required in most areas of IT. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In general, I believe that without a specialized education, it will be more difficult for a specialist to find effective solutions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">On the other hand, he will cope with the tasks of the conditional category of junior.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Again, to neglect higher education, given the recent changes in legislation that employers are obliged to implement professional standards, it is not worth it. Just because without a specialized education, career prospects disappear immediately. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Judging the quality of education in Russia is quite difficult. As far as I know, somewhere in the USA, for example, it has a more applied character. On the one hand, Russian IT specialists are listed worldwide. In Perm, for example, we have not one, but several examples of successful IT companies that have gained international recognition. On the other hand, it can be said that now the demand for IT specialists in the market exceeds supply, therefore, perhaps, the market is ready to devour everyone.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You need to get a second degree when this need dictates the company's field of activity, for example, if you are engaged in analytics, subject research. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In addition to the skills acquired in the course of training, I would note the demand for large companies to work in a team. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most often, in such companies the collective method of development is common, therefore, when hiring, they will give preference to a less brilliant team player than to a talented but controversial employee.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319342/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319342/</a></p>
