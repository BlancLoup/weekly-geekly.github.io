How much time do you spend your time with your favorite gadgets?  What is this?  Absorbing fashion for mobile apps?  Mobile disease of the century called "tear your eyes off your smartphone"?  Call it what you will, but <b>the mobile application market is really evolving at the speed of light</b> , and we actively keep up with the times, using applications in everyday life.  But let's focus on the applications that are created for business. <br><br><h4>  A good impetus for business development </h4><br>  People start to earn more and spend more, and in view of the fact that our life is becoming more mobile, money is spent in particular on smartphones and mobile applications.  This state of affairs is a good impetus for business development, especially for the rapidly developing market of mobile applications. <br>  The fact that the market for smartphones and tablets for 2012 has grown by half cannot be ignored by business owners.  Already, KPCB analysts talk about the prevalence of the supply of mobile devices over the supply of laptops and personal computers, and this means that we are entering the so-called ‚Äúpost-computer era‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/cbd/7f5/a6e/cbd7f5a6ef2bf7c8abe831d35354ce25.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  To have or not to have? </h4><br>  To dispel all your doubts about the need for mobile applications, I will give a few reasons why it is a must have now. <br>  - The application is a powerful additional sales tool.  Since consumers have decided to switch from laptops to smartphones, follow them and the increase in sales will not keep you waiting long. <br>  - the application is much simpler and easier to use, especially if your site is not optimized for mobile devices.  Consumers do not want to search for the necessary option on your site for a long time, wasting time and nerves. <br>  - With the help of applications it will be easier to get feedback.  Write a comment or share the link with friends on social networks, users can on the go. <br>  - application - an additional channel of information and a good way to give this information delicious.  It is easier for you to inform customers about promotions, discounts, news, and so on.  by push notifications.

The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project was born as a result of an analysis of the current situation on the Internet in general and in the market of mobile devices and applications in particular.  Now the number of downloads from the most popular app stores - the App Store, Google Play and Windows Phone - has exceeded 55 billion. More than 50% of Facebook users log into it from their mobile devices using applications.  And indeed, for many users, the smartphone or tablet becomes the first point of access to the network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6c2/815/3a2/6c28153a279f2487d1699e83c7d66daf.png"><br><br><h4>  Why My-Apps? </h4><br>  - Quickly.  Creating an application takes about 10 minutes. <br>  - Simply.  Know the basics of programming and design is not necessary.  Additional hiring of employees is not required - even a child can create an application. <br>  - Available.  The cost of monthly subscriptions remains one of the lowest in the market. <br>  - Conveniently.  Applications created using our service go directly to 3 platforms: iOS, Android and Windows.  We managed to achieve this with the help of our unique technology Instant Apps. <br><br>  Yes, applications will not have a unique design, but do you need a business tool or a beautiful toy? <br>  Yes, you use ready-made blocks.  And they are quite enough to create a functional application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/ec4/8e6/a0b/ec48e6a0b598ae06a56ecb35a2d6ec28.jpg"><br><br><h4>  We work for you </h4><br>  Our work with clients is based on the principle of subscription.  We have developed several options with a different number of functions.  There is also an option for the client to add additional options to the application for a fee.  For example, we can develop an individual design, refine the software and provide services to promote the application. <br>  We give decent functionality for creating simple individual applications, and this is exactly what 90% of users need.  In this case, a simple interface, convenience and intuitive use of the service, arising from the simplicity of the design itself and the absence of a huge number of blocks and modules, we only play into the hands.  This is the advantage of our approach to applications. <br><br>  Create applications and they will make your customers more mobile, and your business more flexible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195750/</a></p>
