It was connected with the claim of some company, which did not like the use of the word "Frontline" in combination with military themes (surprisingly, what else could the front line be associated with?) With the military theme of the game.  But this post is not about that.  Checking the renaming results somehow, I was looking for apps on Google Play and saw a strange picture. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

Probably, Google went wrong, and he forgot that I have Russian everywhere.  Or he could not determine that I am from Russia.  Otherwise, why does he show me the same game with different names? .. I checked the names of the packages and realized that this was the way it was intended. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">List of package names</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  com.igg.castleclash </li><li>  com.igg.castleclash_ru </li><li>  com.igg.castleclash_de </li><li>  com.igg.castleclash_es </li><li>  com.igg.castleclash_tw </li><li>  com.igg.castleclash_it </li><li>  com.igg.castleclash_id </li><li>  com.igg.castleclash_tr </li><li>  com.igg.castleclash_kr </li><li>  com.igg.castleclash_th </li><li>  com.igg.castleclash_pt </li><li>  com.igg.castleclash_de </li></ul><br></div></div><br><br>  ‚ÄúSly!‚Äù I thought.  We took a bunch of places in the list and drove out some of the competitors.  But is it possible?  But what about politics, but what about localization rules?  I decided to ask tech support and wrote them a letter.  Unfortunately, the source text of the letter I have not survived, because I made it through the form on the site, but the general meaning was as follows: <br><blockquote>  Please understand the possible error on Google Play.  This scoundrel shows me the same game. </blockquote><br>  In response, I received a letter of appreciation generated for me personally for my active life position, as well as asking me to send some additional materials on the problem, if any.  I sent them a screenshot from Chrome. <br><br>  Some time later, the answer came: <br><br><blockquote>  Thank you, blah blah blah ... Happy to help you ... blah blah blah <br>  I looked at your problem and according to our data the reason why you see the same application several times is that the developer has different versions of the application for different languages ‚Äã‚Äã/ territories.  However, it is normal that you see so many versions of this application on Google Play. <br>  If I can still help you with blah blah blah .... </blockquote><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The original text of the letter in case my translation does not convey the full depth of meaning.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Hi Alexey <br><br>  Thank you for contacting Google.  My name is today. <br><br>  It has been shown that there has been a lot to be done about it.

Your customer support will definitely help. <br><br>  Kind regards <br><br>  Tom <br><br>  Google Support Team <br></div></div><br><br>  ‚ÄúInteresting,‚Äù I thought.  Is this what everyone can do?  But then on Google Play will be a salad from the repetitive games.  Just in case, I decided to clarify: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello <br>  But this is a violation of Google Play‚Äôs developer program policy and application localization guides using resources.  Is not it?  I do not think this is normal. <br>  There is no need to make different versions of the same application, if you use resources for localization. <br>  Link to politics, blah blah blah ... <br>  Link to localization guide, blah blah blah ... </blockquote><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The original text of the letter in case you are not afraid to read my clumsy English</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Hi! <br><br>  This is a violation of the Google Play Developer Program.
