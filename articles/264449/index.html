    <h3>  Marketplace as a functional extension of Azure </h3><br>  Today in the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/marketplace/">Azure Marketplace</a> you can find dozens of services offered by independent developers that extend the functionality of the Azure cloud.  Solutions available in the store are divided into categories: virtual machines, developer services, API Apps, connectors for Azure Active Directory, web applications, data services, Docker containers, Microsoft Dynamics solutions.  Consider them in order. <br><br>  <strong>Virtual machines</strong> <br><br>  The ‚Äú <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/marketplace/virtual-machines/">Virtual Machines</a> ‚Äù section aggregates all solutions built on the basis of Linux and Windows virtual machines, both by the open source software community and third-party commercial software developers and Microsoft.  In mid-July 2015, the store presented more than 650 different solutions, among them: Windows Server 2012 R2, Cloudera Enterprise, Jelastic, DataStax, Veeam Cloud Connect, SAP HANA Developer Edition, NGINX, CoreOS, Kaspersky Labs solutions, IBM DB2 and many others. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a93/ec7/6c7/a93ec76c77754004947dcf43b0d2d09c.png"></div><br>  Developers and IT professionals can, in a few clicks, purchase and deploy any of the solutions in their Azure infrastructure environment in the form of one or a whole set of virtual machines.  The store greatly facilitates the deployment of solutions, offering everything you need for quick manual or, most importantly, automatic deployment of solutions, both on the basis of a single machine, and the most complex configurations of entire clusters of machines, combined into virtual networks and configured for high availability. <br><br>  <strong>Developer Services</strong> <br><br>  The <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/marketplace/developer-services/">services</a> section <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/marketplace/developer-services/">for developers</a> offers new and existing PaaS services that are previously available in the Azure Store, offering a variety of features for IaaS or PaaS solutions based on Azure cloud. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/620/761/8c1/6207618c12254ecb856dc1e37e1b9df5.png"></div><br>  As of mid-July 2015, more than 50 services from independent developers and Microsoft were presented in the services catalog, including: ABBYY OCR SDK, Auth0, Bing Maps API, ClearDB MySQL, Face APIs, IronMQ, Memcached Cloud, New Relic, MongoLab, Nodejitsu Redis, SendGrid, RavenDB and others. <br><br>  <strong>API Apps</strong> <br><br>  <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/marketplace/api-apps/">API Apps</a> are ready-made API applications created by Microsoft for use by developers in developing Azure Logic App applications built on the basis of workflows (more about Logic Apps). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90f/7a5/488/90f7a5488bcb4401a35ca524cc26f114.png"></div><br>  Among the API Apps presented are Oracle DB Connector, Twitter Connector, Slack Connector, Office 365 and OneDrive Connector and others. <br><br>  <strong>Connectors for Azure Active Directory</strong> <br><br>  The Azure Active Directory service allows you to combine cloud applications and applications located in the enterprise network under a single system of authentication, authorization and security. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d68/637/993/d68637993af8423789a64757d0cc0155.png"></div><br>  A distinctive feature of Azure AD is its integration with external SaaS services and applications, such as Google Apps, Dropbox, Saleforce, Office365, and others.  Thanks to the hundreds of <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/marketplace/active-directory/">ready-made connectors</a> available through the Azure Marketplace, users of Azure AD can easily access third-party services using one account. <br><br>  <strong>Web applications</strong> <br><br>  Azure Marketplace offers <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/marketplace/web-applications/">dozens of ready-made templates for popular CMS</a> and web applications such as Drupal, Wordpress, Django, CakePHP, Flask, Joomla, Express, ASP.NET projects and many others. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41f/d88/f16/41fd88f16b6d4532994b0254749cf99d.png"></div><br>  A distinctive feature of web application templates is that they are designed to be deployed in the Azure Web App environment ‚Äî in the form of services rather than virtual machines, thereby simplifying and speeding up their deployment, maintenance and cost reduction. <br><br>  <strong>Data services</strong> <br><br>  By integrating <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/marketplace/">Azure Marketplace</a> with a large number of data services and data sources, developers can easily access public data on demographics, maps, search queries, recommendations, geography, translation, and others. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d5/523/ed6/6d5523ed6dd544ae98dcca6d6d3ec668.png"></div><br>  Data from the Azure Marketplace can be <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/marketplace/data-services/">easily obtained and integrated</a> into your own solutions. <br><br>  <strong>Docker Containers</strong> <br><br>  One of the most recent additions to the Azure Marketplace has been the containerized applications section, ready for deployment in the Azure cloud environment. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/790/20f/509/79020f509b514e9099b2a22c71b03bef.png"></div><br>  Among them, at the moment are presented: Redis, Nginx, MySQL, Jenkins, Memcached, Elasticsearch, RabbitMQ and other popular tools.  All <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com/%3Fl%3Den.ru-ru%26amp%3Br%3D1">containers from this section are</a> created using Docker technology and can be quickly deployed to Azure. <br><br>  <strong>Microsoft Dynamics Solutions</strong> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/26f/ea4/6f8/26fea46f8b074efab613f8c03cc2da4b.png"></div><br>  Another section of the Azure Marketplace is the Microsoft Dynamics Solutions section, which is a set of ready-to-use virtual machine-based configurations of the Dynamics family for quick deployment on the Microsoft Azure platform. <br><br><h3>  Quick start with Azure Marketplace </h3><br>  In order to quickly deploy a complex solution on the Azure platform, you can take advantage of the Azure Marketplace.  To do this, select the solution in the Azure store (consider the example of a <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/marketplace/partners/datastax/datastax-enterprise-non-production-use-only/">DataStax-based Apache Cassandra cluster</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc1/57e/fe1/cc157efe14c846909a467c4189096ee1.png"><br><br>  A click on the Create Virtual Machine link takes you to the Azure portal to create a cluster wizard based on the DataStax solution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c75/04e/412/c7504e412db54c51a7c1ed3b1ad9b08c.png"><br><br>  After filling in the required parameters, you will be able to set the cluster size with the number of nodes: <br><br><img alt="datastaxmarketplace5" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/335/f61/179/335f6117936bbabfabdb36e4c23b7109.png" width="459" height="480"><br><br>  By specifying a few more parameters, you will get a cluster uniting multiple nodes deployed to Azure: <br><br><img alt="datastaxmarketplace7" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f60/59e/4f6/f6059e4f6428b64075d8433a2e54493a.png" width="610" height="348"><br><br>  Thus, Azure Marketplace allowed in a few clicks and in a few minutes to deploy a complex infrastructure solution consisting of dozens of elements. <br><br><h3>  Azure Marketplace as a sales channel </h3><br>  We looked at the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/marketplace/">Azure Marketplace</a> as a powerful tool that makes it easy for developers and IT professionals to deploy solutions and organize environments based on different solutions in the Azure cloud. <br><br>  On the other hand, Azure Marketplace is a powerful sales channel for independent software developers.  Today dozens of new solutions from companies from many countries are added to the store every month.  These solutions receive a variety of marketing support from Microsoft and additional promotion to the target audience.  An example of such a promotion is the <a href="https://twitter.com/MSPartnerApps">Microsoft Partner Apps</a> channel. <br><br>  With its presence in more than a hundred markets around the world, the Azure Markertplace channel is a great way for any software developer to enter the global scene and start selling themselves anywhere in the world without the hassle of legal and tax issues. <br><br>  <strong>Azure Marketplace in Russia</strong> <br><br>  Today, developers from two dozen countries can publish solutions in Azure Marketplce.  While Russia is not included in the list of such countries and the publication for Russian developers is limited.  However, several Russian companies with a global presence have already successfully published their solutions in the Azure Marketplace.  Among them: <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/%3Fterm%3Dkaspersky">Kaspersky Labs</a> , <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/veeam/veeamcloudconnect/">Veeam</a> , <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/jelastic/jelastic-hybrid-paas-standard/">Jelastic</a> and <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partners/nginxinc/nginx-plus-v1/">NGINX</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="650" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a1/8bc/bf3/3a18bcbf369544be8499ce24ac64dd3e.png"></div><br><br>  The possibility of publishing solutions from Russia will be added in the near future.  In the meantime, Russian developers and IT professionals can freely use the Azure Marketplace and third-party solutions to create new interesting projects based on the Azure cloud. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  We looked at the opportunities and advantages of the Azure Marketplace store for developers and IT professionals who are interested in new features and independent software vendors who want to get a new sales channel for their solution, enter new markets, get support and more. promotion. <br><br>  Azure Marketplace is a new tool, a platform, a channel from Microsoft, its functionality will constantly increase, and its geographical presence will expand.  Today, the store has more than 3,300 different-purpose products from hundreds of independent developers and open source communities. <br><br>  In the following articles, we will continue to share the details and news of the Azure Marketplace and the stories of our partners who have already started using the store for their own purposes. <br><br><h3>  news </h3><br>  At the last Microsoft WPC partner conference, new Azure Marketplace features were announced, including support for Multi-VM configurations and software deployment management through Azure Resource Manager templates.
