However, the results surprised me. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For a start, I note that all search queries were made from Russia and I understand that the result for other countries will be different.

      So: <br>  Mail.ru, the most famous and unloved by many geeks, Mail.ru runet, appeared on the first line of 4 main search systems at once: <br><br>  <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Fclid%3D41139%26yasoft%3Dbarff%26text%3D%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%26lr%3D54">yandex.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.google.ru/search%3Fie%3DUTF-8%26hl%3Dru%26q%3D%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%26redir_esc%3Dy%26ei%3DqJtuS4yxCZyI_AaR9eXJBg">google.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search%3Fp%3D%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%26ei%3DUTF-8">yahoo.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://nova.rambler.ru/search%3Fquery%3D%25FD%25EB%25E5%25EA%25F2%25F0%25EE%25ED%25ED%25E0%25FF%2520%25EF%25EE%25F7%25F2%25E0%26btnG%3D%25CD%25E0%25E9%25F2%25E8%2521">rambler.ru</a> <br><br>  Where is Mail.ru Search?  About him later. <br><br>  So Yandex offers Mail.ru mail as the first link in the output, Yandex also did not forget its own mail and placed it on the third line, Yandex gave the fifth line to Rambler, Gmail did not bother to mention it on the first page of the search results. <br><br>  Google turned out to be more noble and put Yandex mail on the second line after Mail.ru, while putting its own Gmail on the first page of the search results last. <br><br>  Although Rambler put Mail.ru on the first line of issue, he placed an ad block of his own postal service above it (perhaps this is the most logical solution among search engines), did not forget Rambler about Yandex mail with Gmail on the first page of issue. <br><br>  Yahoo offered Mail.ru, Yandex-mail and Rambler-mail, but did not say a word on the first page of the issue, not only about Gmail, but even about its own mail service. <br><br>  Aport.ru (remember this search engine?) In advertising blocks offers to use Mail.ru first (in the Yandex advertising block), and then the Email.ru service, apparently belonging to it (in its own advertising block).  In search results, the first place is taken not by the most popular, but possibly paid Nextmail and Mail forever, and only then Mail.ru with Yandex follow. <br><br>  Intellectual search engine Nigma.ru, apparently, does not have its own postal service and offers to use the services of Gmail. <br><br>  A new search engine from Microsoft <a href="http://www.bing.com/search%3Fq%3D%25D1%258D%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2520%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2587%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">Bing</a> apparently not yet accustomed to the Russian conditions.  He not only does not offer Mikrosoftovsky live mail on the first page of delivery (rightly believing that the number of its users in Russia is small), but also does not offer any well-known mail service for the investigated request on the first page of issue. <br><br>  However, I was most surprised by the result of Mail.ru Search.  As it is known from the new year, Mail.ru Search works on its own gogo search engine.  So the first line <a href="http://go.mail.ru/search%3Fmailru%3D1%26q%3D%25FD%25EB%25E5%25EA%25F2%25F0%25EE%25ED%25ED%25E0%25FF%2B%25EF%25EE%25F7%25F2%25E0%26us%3D11">Search Mail.ru</a> offers to use Gmail.  Mail.ru's own mail is not mentioned at all on the first page of the search results (!) As well as the postal services of other major players in this market.  Perhaps this was one of the conditions of the sensational New Year agreement Mail.ru and Google? <br><br>  These are the amazing things that happen with email services and their search engine optimization. <br><br>  PS Habrayuzer <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/mobby/" class="user_link">Mobby</a> designed the information in a table for fans of tabular way of presenting information.
