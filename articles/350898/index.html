In 2018, the work of managers was assessed by internal rating and employee feedback.  It turned out that teams with good leaders work more productively and feel happy.  Google conducted a large-scale survey of employees and found out which 10 qualities distinguish a strong leader: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/um/ei/la/umeilavk8j2uroi6pocgunwb71i.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. A good mentor </h3><br>  Employees appreciate a manager who is willing to share knowledge and devote time to them not only when his help in solving problems is required. <br><br><h3>  2. Refuses micromanagement </h3><br>  Google found that their best managers maintain a balance of freedom and initiative in teams, showing their trust in their employees.

    <h3>  3. Creates a unique team environment, taking care of employee success. </h3><br>  It is important to create an atmosphere where each employee will feel part of a team and see his or her work result in order to achieve a common goal. <br><br><h3>  4. Productive and works on the result </h3><br>  People don't want to work for a lazy boss.  Everyone wants to be part of a productive and successful team, but it is difficult if the leader does not set the working rhythm. <br><br><h3>  5. Listens to employees and shares information. </h3><br>  The manager must have communication skills: communicate, negotiate, resolve conflicts, and most importantly, hear the opinions of employees. <br><br><h3>  6. Supports employee development and sharing feedback. </h3><br>  A good manager helps employees improve their skills, cares about their career growth and gives honest reviews of their effectiveness (Performance Review). <br><br><h3>  7. Has a development strategy for product and team </h3><br>  To communicate to the team a vision of the company's goals is one of the main tasks of the manager.  Employees want to understand what each task is done for, what it will lead to and how their work will affect the global level. <br><br><h3>  8. Owns key technical skills </h3><br>  Google manager understands the process of creating a product, can prompt or help with the solution of a specific task, but is not an expert in all areas.  Each employee has more knowledge in his area than a manager, and rightly so. <br><br><h3>  9. Collaborates with other teams. </h3><br>  For Google employees, it is important to constantly interact with other teams - the speed of solving common tasks and the quality of work depends on this.  Therefore, a cool manager can build communications for cross-functional projects and coordinated teamwork. <br><br><h3>  10. Makes significant decisions. </h3><br>  It is important to discuss the problem in a team and listen to the suggestions of colleagues, but the manager should make the decision and take responsibility. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350898/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350898/</a></p>
