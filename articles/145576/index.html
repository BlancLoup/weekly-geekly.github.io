Informal</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the fourth day of the exhibition, Elitegroup invited me for a walk to the province of Ilan on the east coast of the island of Taiwan.  The program of the event included a visit to the local farm and kayaking.  Habrazhiteli are not alive with iron alone - rest is also needed and important. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54d/411/f3a/54d411f3a3b94af93332b1551f22d263.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      At the entrance to the farm is a strange figure, which probably would have been more suitable for a Finnish or other northern country.  Deer-drawn sleighs clearly attract visitors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/27d/4c8/016/27d4c80164778da83693808706ab0437.jpg"><br><br>  The farm is located in the foothills, near the coast.  On the east coast of Taiwan, the coastal strip is very narrow, literally a kilometer and the mountains begin.  To protect against floods and typhoons, farms are built far from the shore.  We climbed up the shore of the picturesque creek. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a0/ce7/e7d/8a0ce7e7d73dfc32805a43d6c207ffb7.jpg"><br><br>  And this is the habrauser <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/neoforce/" class="user_link">neoforce</a> , your humble servant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f2f/822/277/f2f82227737a3df1f05d477e16f47280.jpg"><br><br>  On the bank of a small brook there are nets on which the caterpillars of rice butterflies live.  Their appearance does not inspire confidence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba6/ccb/af2/ba6ccbaf2a340f1be1a84c13cf166db7.jpg"><br><br>  But in the end, cute white butterflies that pollinate rice fields on the other side of the streamlet come from takey. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8bf/294/d18/8bf294d188d1e965a605ca8d12188894.jpg"><br><br>  Of domestic animals on the farm there are geese, pigs and goats familiar to the Russian person.  In the latter, the pen is brought closer to the visitors and everyone can feed the animals with tree leaves and grass.  Of course, little animals eat everything with pleasure and sadly look at people, asking for an extra portion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/220/254/b77/220254b77a065c8645dc3044f88f6055.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/132/5ec/db5/1325ecdb5d1f2855370761e3ddf9b307.jpg"><br><br>  The rice fields themselves consist of six sections on which the grain is planted in turn.  Round-the-clock farming is possible due to the warm climate of the island. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/90d/875/139/90d87513937b92536e580e5a6745eaef.jpg"><br><br>  In the ponds, which on the farm many carps swim. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f3/5f6/c01/1f35f6c01257768309d72f78445415fc.jpg"><br><br>  Streams running from the mountains, ennoble and use not only as a source of water, but also as a decoration for tourists. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/277/ccb/ffa/277ccbffab4a7a677d1bef7610d3f4c7.jpg"><br><br>  Buffaloes roam the farm completely calmly, spending most of the day in a huge puddle.  The heat makes one know about oneself not only to people, animals relax in the most sun.  By the way, journalists, apparently belong to a different category of the population, we were brought on a tour at 12 noon. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5d8/483/f2e/5d8483f2e43b7aab362c87af4838ac1b.jpg"><br><br>  Many fruit trees are planted in the territory - wax apples and pomelo.  There were no fruits on apple trees, but the pomelo was simply covered with fruits.  As the guide told us, this is a sort of Thongdi, with pink flesh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e46/c7a/0e5/e46c7a0e57ad9c35bfb2091176f06d59.jpg"><br><br>  I also liked the two flowering plants from the local flora, but I couldn‚Äôt find out exactly what I was, because the guide could not explain clearly in English how the flowers are called. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b9e/1c7/758/b9e1c77589784de8ba57ef6de772b468.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/027/033/d36/027033d36a6920fe3d748b78e23b210b.jpg"><br><br>  After a walk around the farm, we were turned into a kindergarten.  The task was the simplest - to make an application for a T-shirt.  Leaves from local trees were proposed as stencils (there were no ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù leaves), and local solutions on natural components were used as paint.  The Russian part of the expedition enthusiastically set to work and showed the ability worthy of Picasso and Van Gogh =). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d0/349/f31/2d0349f31237724da1b96caecf8c6a50.jpg"><br><br>  Taking T-shirts as souvenirs, we went for a snack, but since I am not an ardent supporter of local dishes, I can say that watermelon was delicious and green tea was refreshing. <br><br>  The second part of the journey took place to the north, and we drove along the coast for about an hour and a half.  The view of the ocean was periodically interrupted by sad monuments, such as the shell of a tanker, which stranded along the coast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/48a/ae3/3ba/48aae33ba24f32e640c7a280760be30a.jpg"><br><br>  Anyone could go kayaking, it's such a small, nimble little boat.  I did not refuse, especially since in late childhood and early youth I went canoeing along the Vuoksa river a little.  I didn‚Äôt want to sacrifice a camera, so I‚Äôm going to continue with pictures from an iPhone, which I left to a colleague on the beach.  As it turned out not in vain, the very first turn on a kayak turned for me to scoop water from behind the board and full shorts of happiness =). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/416/7ca/d1f/4167cad1f44a4e0d0bc48601bab5e41d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d2/4ee/8bb/2d24ee8bb5a763b30372b6f146ddda11.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f54/4df/4e1/f544df4e1886930890c4b9b34d4ac2be.jpg"><br><br>  It can be seen on the last photo is not very cool, but in the middle - it's me. <br><br>  By the way, there is such a beautiful temple on the shore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/37a/f9d/62c/37af9d62c4efda5f32b66148496c7acf.jpg"><br><br>  Actually the next post will be the final report from the exhibition, today, on the last day, I realized that it is impossible to embrace the immensity and illuminate all the stands, but I will do my best to please as many habratchiteli as possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145576/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145576/</a></p>
