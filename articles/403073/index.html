As I did this in Barcelona, ‚Äã‚ÄãI inquired about the range of NLL. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the city of Como (where we lived) there were 2 specialized stores.  One very tiny, but it is for the lamps.  They trade in ‚Äúno-game‚Äù, no Osramov, Philips and Samsung.  The most popular are the NLL company Life. <br><br>  For the sample, I bought this one: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe1/479/e9d/fe1479e9d59548d2a09dcbe14d390aec.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  The properties are good, but the price is quite high - 7 euros.  I don‚Äôt speak about evaluation methods, see my previous articles on this topic.

      The table below provides information for the lamp (packaging data) Life 5W 490lm 39.920341C G45 E14: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6f/7ef/cdc/a6f7efcdcb854d6d8df69e2fd0346a11.png" alt="image"></div><br>  * - After warming up for 21 minutes. <br>  ** - According to the indications of the luxmeter in comparison with the exemplary 60 watt lamp. <br><br>  Pleases high value of the color rendering index.  Which, moreover, is confirmed visually (see <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/285784/">separate article</a> ) through a spectroscope: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61e/ea5/224/61eea52247b342629746700d43eb2919.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Transitional characteristics (power, light and temperature) look like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e8/ab0/fa9/0e8ab0fa9d1a444990036f7e23764608.png" alt="image"></div><br>  A reduction in electrical power of less than 9% looks great.  The main thing is that the absolute value of the power after warming up was 5.3 W (remember, the nominal value is 5 W).  The fall in illumination (i.e., in fact, luminous flux) by 19% is quite a lot, but the luminous flux from an already heated lamp was 475 lm at a nominal of 490. It is interesting that the luminous flux estimate using the camera (see book) in this case gives a very large error <b>for the</b> greater part, it turns out as much as 700 lm (which can not be, because there can never be).  Therefore, I estimated the luminous flux by the indications of a luxmeter in comparison with a standard lamp.  At the same time, the declared service life is 30,000 hours (3 years warranty). <br><br>  In general, this lamp pleased me greatly.  It only remains to envy the Italians.  The most curious thing is that on the packaging and on the bulb of the lamp it is directly written Made in CHINA (just so, in large letters).  In this case, the customer and distributor is <a href="http://www.life-electronics.com/">an Italian company</a> .  This is just an example of what can be achieved from Chinese manufacturers with the right approach and careful control.  (I don‚Äôt know who designed this lamp, but I suspect that the Italians did it). <br><br>  The second store is a "supermarket" of electronics.  NLT there are the most common "noune", all Chinese, so I did not buy anything.  In general, as I noted, the larger and more versatile the store, the worse the range of a certain product group there is. <br><br>  One day we went to the city of Monza (it‚Äôs 25 minutes by train).  Actually, we were interested in the biggest outlet in Italy, Adidas, in Italy.  But next, as it turned out, there is a small wholesale electrical products store.  The Italians generally develop such a system, when members of a certain ‚Äúshop‚Äù have customer cards in certain semi-closed stores.  When I worked in Milan, one colleague had such a card in a computer and component store.  And due to this, he did a small business - the institute ordered computers for him, and he bought them in small wholesale, on which he had his 10%.  Yes, there is a small electrical goods store through the fence with the Adidas outlet. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3a/1f7/9a5/f3a1f79a5f6b4e9cb3b98dbda1bcc4ee.png" alt="image"></div><br>  This is a frame from Google Maps in street view.  If anyone suddenly need, the address Monza, Via della Giardina, 19. <br><br>  I was not allowed inside, because  I am not a member of the guild (I do not have a card).  But the seller kindly agreed to take the best quality SDL from availability.  These were the lamps of Osram and Philips companies, with all kinds of nominal values.  Naturally, I could not stand it and for 10 euros I bought a dimmable Philips lamp with a power of 8.5 watts. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbb/817/157/dbb817157f1541f19cf9a1bf027ab1f6.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  (The first time I see such a fractional denomination and the first time I test dimmable SDL.) <br><br>  A kind of lamp - the service life is specified 15,000 hours (the previous one, let me remind you, 30,000), and the number of on / off cycles is 50,000. Obviously, this number is due to the use of a dimming driver. <br><br>  The table below provides information for the lamp (packaging data) Philips CorePro LEDbulb 8.5 806 lm: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b56/93a/e99/b5693ae99b4c445c8ca9c53bb16adac7.png" alt="image"></div><br>  * - After warming up for 21 minutes. <br><br>  A very high power factor draws attention.  I attribute a certain lack of luminous flux to the fact that the voltage in our network is rarely equal to 230 V. The spectrum of the lamp as a whole correlates with a high value of the color rendering index: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e4b/aab/a40/e4baaba40a47457980cf7bcafd090486.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Transitional characteristics (power, light and temperature) look like this: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/817/421/426/81742142639143f59dc597695231be51.png" alt="image"></div><br>  The shape of the power and light curves is somewhat different (not a pure exponent).  A 9% reduction in electrical power looks strange to me.  Firstly, the power is declared 8.5, and after warming up it takes place to be 7.8 watts.  Secondly, I just didn‚Äôt expect that the dimmable lamps had a drop in power during heating the same as on conventional SDLs (see the first lamp described above).  The fall in illumination (i.e., in fact, luminous flux) by 15% is within reasonable limits (although, again, I expected more from a dimmable lamp from a reputable manufacturer). <br><br>  In addition, through the camera of the smartphone, quite strong pulsations are noticeable: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/37d/78f/eaf/37d78feafe364f4080de2a1709b6b259.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  (horizontal dark and light lines). <br><br>  In conclusion, I will show what is written on the packaging of this lamp: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63b/ece/834/63bece83419d430b86c7c1402e896a23.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  This is me to the fact that there is persistent talk about the fact that Phillips completely "sold out" to the Chinese (I am on the SDL division).  For this package / photo, it turns out that the situation is different (including pay attention to copyright in 2016). <br><br>  Finally, one day we wandered into an expensive lighting boutique: sconces, wall and table lamps, floor and table lamps, and so on. By the way, all this is very immodest.  Banal table lamp on the CD - about 300 euros.  Of course, the LEDs there are very decent, but to pay so much money the hand does not rise. <br><br>  Yes, so at the cashier there were several SDLs for sale.  One of them is extremely interested in me already with its appearance: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfb/eef/214/cfbeef21457d4176ae6720c042fcb63c.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  <i>(photo from the manufacturer's website)</i> <br><br>  It turned out that in the tiny Republic of San Marino (which the Italians stubbornly believe are part of Italy) has its own lamp manufacturer.  <a href="http://www.marinocristal.com/materiale_elettrico.php%3Fscid%3D8%26sscid%3D51">Under the link you will find</a> detailed specifications.  They are impressive. <br><br>  It is worth dimmable lamp at 13 W 56 euros.  I would find this amount (which you can't do for a hobby) - but I couldn‚Äôt figure it out, due to which the manufacturer promises 40,000 hours of work (4-year warranty).  The flask is closed tightly.  I thought about the spaced phosphor - but there are no details on the manufacturer‚Äôs website.  It is very difficult to make a high-quality phosphor film of such a size and such a complex shape on the ceiling.  Mentioned SD company Epistar.  But then it is just filaments tightly closed with a matte diffuser (a banal ‚Äúcorn‚Äù is very unlikely).  That so much time work seems to be no way. <br><br>  Therefore, there will be no test, just keep in mind that there are such options. <br><br>  <b>My impressions</b> can be <b>summarized</b> as follows: the situation with LED lamps in Italy is quite good.  Better than in Spain (last year I did a similar review, but then on another resource as a replica on the forum).  Ordinary lamps in an ordinary store a little expensive, but very decent quality.  And if you wish, it is easy enough to find good lamps from recognized manufacturers. <br><br>  As far as I know Italians (I worked in Italy and have been to it many times), this is just a manifestation of their national character.  They can be treated differently, they are full of flaws.  But they really respect themselves.  Not in words - but in deeds, which is expressed in the quality of consumer goods.  Italian food, clothing, furniture - they simply do not allow bad goods to appear on the shelves of their stores (even on the shelves of street bazaars).  Diluting palm oil with palm oil to get more money out of the pockets of their compatriots, it never even occurs to them ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403073/</a></p>
