  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hamster Marketplace development team: how our outsourcer became a partner and why AI is to blame</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Crowdfunding is one of the most schizophrenic modern activities.  This is because crowdfunds should focus on two things at the same time: fundraising campaigns (that is, crowdfunding itself) and the product for which these funds are collected.  And not everyone is able to keep the focus, as many sad songs have already been sung about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xc/b3/wc/xcb3wclic5ujbnq3liho_0kz4by.jpeg"><br><br>  This fate and the <a href="http://hmstr.io/">Hamster Marketplace</a> project did not escape - having spent the presale in December 2017, we started working on two fronts at once on the New Year holidays: preparing for a large-scale tokensale that is already underway, and developing an alpha version of the product itself - a decentralized platform for trading unique Indi and DIY electronics.  And we managed to do this thanks to a radical expansion of our team: in January, one of the best Moscow development teams of the Indatalab company joined the Hamster Marketplace team almost completely. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  So straight and the best? </h2><br>  One of the best - does not mean that one of the loudest.  Probably, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense for IT people to explain that the IT market is not limited by the competition of web design studios, there are enough projects, and sometimes entire businesses that live their busy lives in the shadow of NDA.  Indatalab is one such company.  Our advisor Dmitry Pavlyuchenkov introduced us to Indatalab CEO <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yuriychaynikov/">Yury Chaynikov</a> , as well as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sokolov-alex-4260296a/">Alexey Sokolov</a> , CTO, presenting them as one of the best development teams with which he had to deal.

      However, our initial intention was only to determine what part of the development we could outsource to unload the team that was already working inhouse on the key tasks of the marketplace and tokensale.  But then everything went a little out of plan: already at the first meeting we caught ourselves not discussing the nuances of developing a personal account of the tokensale, but how a specialized AI could allow the management of the marketplace to be truly decentralized.  And these are not empty words.  At the time of our acquaintance, work with neural networks has already become one of the key interests for Indatalab.  Therefore, tell a little about their stories. <br><br><h2>  From the network to the neural networks </h2><br>  Back in 2008, Indatalab was just a web development studio.  But, moving in the right direction, they gradually increased new competencies, adding development of desktop applications, mobile development and machine learning to the team‚Äôs skills pool.  Now the qualification of the Indatalab team allows the company to implement complex multi-level projects using diverse programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies (Java, PHP, JS, SWIFT, Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn and others) using the best DevOps practices on the Atlassian technology stack (Jira, Bitbucket, Confluence, Bamboo and others). <br><br>  The most difficult project in the Indatalab portfolio was the development of a system for detecting and classifying objects based on data from distributed vibroacoustic sensors.  This project had to solve a whole heap of problems at all stages of development: from bureaucracy and infrastructure issues (it was about processing the data stream at 1 Gbit / s) to coordination in the field, creating predictive models and integrating into the final product.  Thanks to the skills of the team in the field of machine learning, the tasks were successfully solved.  Since then, work with neural networks has become one of the foci of Indatalab activities. <br><br>  Among the largest projects and customers of the company are the IIDF, AlfaStrakhovanie and T8.  Of course, most of these glorious labor exploits are under the NDA. <br><br><h3>  In Hamster Marketplace We Trust </h3><br>  Quite the opposite story from Hamster Marketplace.  Since its relatively recent birth in July 2017, it immediately began to make its way into people.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãentrepreneur Denis Bulavin, who mastered the transfer of production of children's tablets from China to the Moscow region, was simple: a decentralized marketplace for indie manufacturers of unique electronics - that is, everyone who, roughly speaking, is not larger than it, or even less.  Without intermediaries, without degrading competition with low-quality copies of foreign products and with a minimum commission.  To reduce the cost of such a project, one must be resourceful - and we believe that <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/hamstermarketplace/blog/338724/">specialized AI is already in many ways ready to replace specialized managers</a> .  However, AI is a superstructure. <br><br>  The basis that allows the Hamster Marketplace to become a truly decentralized project is, of course, the blockchain.  Two blockchains will be involved in Hamster Marketplace: Ethereum, on which the HMT token is issued, and Emercoin, on which the tracking of packages, the voting system and the registration of marriage will work.  In the latter case, our development team will work together with Emercoin experts under the guidance of its technical director Oleg <a href="https://habr.com/users/olegarch/" class="user_link">olegarch</a> Hovayko.  The blockchain will reduce complex chains of quality control of the product and service, which are obviously critical for the site selling DIY products. <br><br>  In this form, Hamster turned out to be of interest not only to the public, manufacturers and private investors, but also to the developer community, in which the subject of indie electronics is extremely close.  Indatalab was no exception, taking a rather unprecedented decision to enter part of its team in the Hamster Marketplace on a partnership basis.  Now, telling how Indatalab has experience in the development of neural networks, we can safely say that Hamster Marketplace has the same experience in the development of neural networks.  But we will not abuse it :-) <br><br><h3>  Where are you old team delhi, fiends? </h3><br>  Such a question must inevitably arise in the course of the narrative.  Of course, the Vikings from Indatalab did not come to an empty place.  Both the site and the previous version of the personal account that worked on the pre-sale were also developed within the team.  But a good leader knows not only his own strength, but also the limits of his possibilities.  Putting even good designers, layout designers and developers together is one task.  Turning them into an effective team is completely different.  And, let's be honest, entrepreneurs, marketers and financiers are not exactly the people from whom you expect it to be effectively addressed.  And in our case it was not worth it.  Therefore, with the developers with whom we made presale, everything is fine.  Those who wanted to stay - stayed, having reintegrated into the process, already under the guidance of the professional CTO, Alexey Sokolov.  It is difficult to imagine who did not win from this: with one shot, not only did two birds with one stone kill, but it was possible to arrange a small local genocide. <br><br>  Yury Chaynikov also entered the project as a Product Owner - a person who determines the global development course in direct connection with the project founders and, of course, the CTO.  Yuri is making every effort for the speedy exit of the site in a public alpha. <br><br>  For such a wonderful occasion, we updated the <a href="https://hmstr.io/">‚ÄúTeam‚Äù</a> block on our <a href="https://hmstr.io/">website</a> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k9/uu/uu/k9uuuuvkzhihlezzienhqiqn6la.png"><br><br>  Such an introduction is also not the first time for Indatalab: in addition to turnkey projects, the guys had to integrate into existing projects, including the support and maintenance of working products.  Again, we consider this a good indicator: to engage in someone else‚Äôs process is how to take on the support and development of someone else‚Äôs code ... however, they also did that. <br><br><blockquote>  From the beginning of the development to the completion of its life cycle, the project lives on average 2‚Äì3 years.  During this period, we can deal with the support of the created product and the correction of errors, as well as the improvement, if necessary, by creating new features and capabilities.  At the end of this cycle, the customer‚Äôs full-time specialists will be able to follow up on the project. <br>  - Alexey Sokolov, CTO Hamster Marketplace </blockquote><br><h3>  Hamster Marketplace Development: On the Road to the Alpha Version </h3><br>  The development life cycle of our team is nine steps: <br><br><ol><li>  Analysis of the tasks and business processes of the project. </li><li>  Prepare business functional requirements. </li><li>  Preparation of project infrastructure (project in JIRA, server configuration, Git-repository, Bamboo, Confluence). </li><li>  Development (from architecture and design to the finished product).  During the development, regular meetings with the client are provided. </li><li>  Testing (regression testing card, manual testing and autotest on Selenium) at all stages of development. </li><li>  Product transfer (documentation, repositories, docker containers). </li><li>  Integration with client's business processes. </li><li>  Maintenance and technical support. </li><li>  Project decommissioning. </li></ol><br>  Now the development of the alpha version of Hamster Marketplace is between the third and fourth stages.  Quite a lot depends on the final budget of the project, which will be determined only after the completion of the crowdsale HMT tokens, which is reflected in our roadmap: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j1/d_/_-/j1d__-iodj-ffrmvrf1h7ow-d5c.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ne/us/wx/neuswx8-eiznlzc_1-7fijkfz9k.png"><br><br><h2>  Do not switch </h2><br>  In more detail about the specifications and the development of the site trading platform Hamster Marketplace, we will tell in the following publications.  To talk with us directly and find out what the community thinks about us - <a href="https://t.me/hmstrRU">join our group in Telegram</a> .  And most importantly - participate <a href="https://hmstr.io/">in our tokensale</a> .  Support us now, because there may not be another opportunity.  So far, there is only the second week of sales, and a 15% bonus applies to the purchase of HMT tokens. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/349282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/349282/</a></p>
