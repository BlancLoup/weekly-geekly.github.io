Many people still think that there are no gaming laptops, but in this case, manufacturers simply would not pay so much attention to this area.  And it has long been known that games are the most powerful engine of progress.  And now let's at least for the time being reading this review close our eyes to stereotypes and look at the real situation in the world of gaming laptops.

Accordingly, the price they will vary greatly (as well as performance).  In particular, my case was about the model <b>G72GX-TY009V</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f8/e18/99a/0f8e1899a88e18df77a372aa1bcec62e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The computing heart in it is a dual- <a href="http://syndication.intel.com/DistributeModule.aspx%3Fppc_cid%3DIIP_00975099714%26cc%3DRU%26contentType%3D0">core <b>Intel Core 2Duo</b></a> <b>T9600</b> with a clock frequency of <a href="http://syndication.intel.com/DistributeModule.aspx%3Fppc_cid%3DIIP_00975099714%26cc%3DRU%26contentType%3D0"><b>2.8</b></a> <b>GHz</b> - this may not be the latest mobile solution from Intel, however, to put a bad processor in a new gaming laptop would not.  Looking ahead, the processor was not at all the weak point of a high-performance system! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/03f/1f7/e57/03f1f7e57a904bef67185bdf9d99bfec.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/78c/397/06d/78c39706de4e147f858ac952b19299f4.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eab/ae6/599/eabae65993e088aa7abe8df28996f7d0.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  In da box </h2><br>  Inside the huge color box was a laptop, a battery, a large network adapter with five (!) Different plugs and a couple of compacts with different software.  Happy buyers, unlike an engineering sample, will also get a <b>Razer Copperhead</b> gaming mouse and a backpack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/417/19e/91e/41719e91ebdc8fa7504dcdb4a3dd33ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The laptop is quite large (the reason for that is a large glossy screen and a productive filling), but less than its peers in the class.  The dimensions are 41x30x5.1 (cm) and weighs 4 kg with a battery (5200 mAh, 77 Wh, 14.8 V, 8 cells).  The network adapter weighs almost another kilogram - I don‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs so huge, but fact is a fact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12f/251/027/12f251027d838f9738e17122e2f9982a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the other hand, this laptop can be considered a DTR-system (Desktop Replace), i.e.  as a replacement for a huge hospital, but which you can occasionally take with you on the road, if you really want to play. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/93f/13b/73e/93f13b73eb2972c469490bdacb09e69f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Looking at the appearance of the device, such an internal conversation involuntarily arises first: ‚Äú <i>But should I not perform a masterpiece on a new lacquered piano?</i>  <i>It seems this laptop came out relatively recently, and I have been swearing in reviews for the ubiquitous gloss for half a year.</i>  <i>Or YOU that there, my reviews do not read, hey?</i>  ":) In general, so far nothing remains but to come to terms with this and hope that the era of matte coatings will soon come. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/749/f0a/c64/749f0ac6467f1ff4550140e524eab4ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/277/d41/ba3/277d41ba3568ebe32e7ab3aaafed7539.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, the black case cover is mostly plastic and glossy, but there is an aluminum insert on it - a sheet, on top of which are glowing (blue) stripes and the RoG logo during operation.  The cover snaps securely on the lock, which is located on the front panel. <br><br>  Under the screen is a grid of <b>Altec Lansing</b> speakers - on the left under this grid there are two dim blue indicators, and on the right are five chrome buttons, but they are already lit more brightly.  Only 4 speakers - two under the screen and two on the front;  in total, they give excellent sound, and loud enough.  Nevertheless, the atmosphere of presence will truly be felt, probably, only in good gaming headphones. <br><br>  About the elements on the ends could be told a couple of photos, but in this case they have a small feature. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dde/a9e/731/ddea9e731004bd4069c587f6a52ae805.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The fact is that some of them (connectors) are hidden behind folding flaps, thanks to which minimalism blows pleasantly from the laptop in the ‚Äúassembled‚Äù state.  Nevertheless, everything is available - HDMI, VGA, FireWire, eSATA, 4xUSB, 3 audio jacks and even ExpressCard.  BluRay-drive is not less tasty addition - the laptop is 200% ready for watching movies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0cd/eed/dae/0cdeeddaec82cf005da459a89bc6b4ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ad/25e/1a1/2ad25e1a1abd817b0eb011eccb32a266.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/97e/5b5/faf/97e5b5fafd9cd39a4c084c66f7bc75be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/832/2e8/12e/8322e812efd5584c530252803a2c202a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The keyboard is full-sized and even with a digital block, the keys have rounded corners and gaps between them.  ‚Äú <i>Oh, oh, I saw such keys from OTHER manufacturers - isn't it a shame ?!</i>  "- there was a shout from the improvised hall) I answered the not less improvised microphone:" <i>At one time, ASUS made a netbook, after which absolutely everything began to let them out - are they not ashamed?</i>  ".  Agree, strange logic) So in this device it is such a keyboard, with split keys, convenient to ugliness ... and personally I see absolutely nothing wrong with manufacturers adopting each other's experience of creating convenient and practical things, offering us more alternatives when choosing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfe/4ad/9ba/dfe4ad9ba24964df2066d1d7922d9a43.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b3/f2a/165/7b3f2a165366b13f675fd05ec10c1b63.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The keys are equipped with white adjustable backlight (Fn + F3 / F4 - combinations that are usually empty for simple models) and typing on them is really very convenient - the key travel is small and quiet.  The arrows on the WASD seem to hint at gaming accessories - indeed, where can the players without such hints!  ) When you press Fn + arrow (at the digital unit), the function of the media center is launched. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d2/5b7/263/5d25b726377bf6cb854e61eb639a5e6d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fc3/486/839/fc3486839da5e7461876e88d8019b929.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c1e/b00/d7b/c1eb00d7ba05e57963e02e66f3adedf3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I also liked the touchpad, which in similar (or earlier) models either had some ugly frame, or was heavily sunk into the panel of the case, which only accumulated dust over time.  Everything is much more practical here - a large widescreen touch panel (with the texture of convex "points") is located directly on the body, and its outline is just outlined with thin blue lines.  Under the panel lives one big black button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/90a/8a9/09f/90a8a909fe440697160acf1cc61f78e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da0/396/ccc/da0396cccef45123bb41970669fab53d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The display also performed with dignity - although it is glossy, but because of this it gives off wonderful pictures.  Viewing angles allow you to watch a movie at the same time to several people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/288/fe8/ef8/288fe8ef87112fda3054225f25aaa4d8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Igrulki </h2><br>  During idle, the laptop is almost inaudible - if you close your eyes, you will feel some kind of ‚Äúpresence-absence‚Äù.  When the laptop is under load, the cooler of the video card's cooling system makes itself felt (which is, perhaps, for the better) - warm air starts to flow from the ventilation holes on the rear panel, and the hum becomes noticeable.  You can keep a laptop on your lap - with a load, its bottom heats up to a maximum of 47 degrees in one place, the rest is noticeably cooler. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/377/962/0cb/3779620cb74d000b5897639fd714b124.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 64-bit Windows 7, some tests did not want to work; nevertheless, a couple of ‚Äúparrots‚Äù could be obtained for comparison. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3a0/247/7fb/3a02477fb1405fbe9bd26e2bf52a5348.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>SuperPi 1M</b> - 16.863 seconds <br>  <b>SuperPi 2M</b> - 41.028 seconds <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c84/fc5/56e/c84fc556e5b731c011724d129aa15e36.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11e/9b4/684/11e9b4684aebf0cc96ef9cfbe3b8f125.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>CPUFreeBenchmark</b> - <b>23.97</b> seconds <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/516/638/6c4/5166386c437a3d49cba12ea0d2b4c156.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/336/def/3f8/336def3f81be58679343139ff73e77de.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>3DMark05</b> - 16187 (Default), 9776 (Max) <br>  <b>3DMark06</b> - 10767 (Default), 4945 (Max) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/23a/dc2/4ad/23adc24adb3ccabefedfb263deaf817b.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dad/2fb/56c/dad2fb56c8b25599844cd94c3382cb71.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/22d/c0b/d0e/22dc0bd0e2884f7bb6380063d6157b2b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The system performance index in Windows is <b>5.9</b> (rests on the hard disk), all other parameters are 6.4 and 6.8 (out of 7.9 available). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b8/b8f/71d/1b8b8f71ddf0e5214fde86f3bbf56f83.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, this is what can be said about the hard disk: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d3/4aa/e68/8d34aae686bb334a46dc339c6cb4c40d.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/05c/b5e/49b/05cb5e49b2761e103e2b02f50f27585f.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ea/f2e/d58/8eaf2ed5835567f4e73012872a69fba0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If he were (more precisely, they) with 7200 revolutions, the system would be even quicker. <br><br>  It was possible to play again only in <b>Crysis Warhead</b> - there were no other licensed disks at the time of the test at hand.  At the maximum settings (1600x900 with anti-aliasing) the game was fine, although it is even more comfortable to play in a more benign mode.  The proof is captured on video;) however, with the color rendition through the camera, the trouble is complete.  The sound of the game - from the headphones. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iUfRPAzEzV8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjBQYeAjLuMYbSpBWJu7JQ24Br30g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  I agree that one game is not proof, but I am sure that it will be possible to play no less demanding games on the way (I don‚Äôt know about you, but I don‚Äôt have anything more interesting than Bubbles on the PDA on the way), in the uni or just at home on a cold winter evening. <br><br>  Here are FPS-graphics, shot by a foreign tester-browser: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd7/056/02c/fd705602c5adf9aec5ff086c0d917eed.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  For more information about the performance of the installed video card: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9c/5dd/5a7/c9c5dd5a74d4f8f249fcb26aa33b6e74.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8aa/a55/44f/8aaa5544f8eb9afa42f8b04057f80d3a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This notebook earned not less high points and praise in the independent gaming <a href="http://hi-tech.mail.ru/review/item/1829/">test of the complex</a> , where ASUS G72Gx was compared with similar competitors - <b>Dell Alienware M17x</b> , <b>Toshiba Qosmio X500</b> and <b>MSI GT640</b> .

Here, by the way, is my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/88833/">review of a gaming notebook</a> on Core i7 and with stereo image support. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e1d/3c5/947/e1d3c5947b4b76f83e3fb76d8e7a1e93.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Another review of this device (in English) can be read on <a href="http://www.notebookcheck.net/Review-Asus-G72GX-Gaming-Notebook.22297.0.html">Notebookcheck.net</a> - you can‚Äôt hide anything from them) Oddly enough, all the same high scores and grades. <br><br>  Since we started talking about ASUS gaming laptops, here‚Äôs an interesting video: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/d8h2NvIp6_8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjs45sOElzENgivp_QPXa1iulnjjA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  Check weighing </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Good equipment; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Regarding (other gaming laptops) small size and weight; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  "Mighty" TTX, high performance in games and applications; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Many different connectors, overall nice design; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  High-quality stereo system; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  The presence of BluRay-drive; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Keyboard backlight; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Glossy case and screen; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Great weight (in absolute scale); <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Tangible noise of the cooling system at load; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Short battery life; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  High price. <br><br>  As for the price, it is noticeably lower than that of competitors with a similar bundle, however, at a fairly solid level - from 72,000 rubles for a laptop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb2/cd4/edc/eb2cd4edc51a1ce24bd4d913d6377835.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af9/2a7/40a/af92a740a6d88eb7bf72752fca2cf022.png" alt="image">  The end </h2><br>  Despite the fact that this is not the latest mobile solution from Intel used in this notebook configuration, the notebook performance is at a very high level and in general it turned out to be very balanced.  I don‚Äôt know about games, but after a couple of years it‚Äôs possible to work on such a machine without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c87/a7e/3c5/c87a7e3c54da90debd1c67aca63c2701.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As a rule, those who say that ‚Äúyou cannot play on laptops‚Äù simply once (in bearded years, for example) tried some abstract game piece of iron and since then they live with old memories, often imposing their opinions on others.  Well, or at least they just do not keep track of new items and, at best, they are judged on them only by journal reviews, where you can also write anything you like.  My article, I think, may well pass for proof that modern toys are great for mobile solutions. <br>  Another issue is the price of such games, because gaming laptops are relatively expensive.  Here everyone has to decide on the needs and possibilities.  Give someone a stationary computer that you can upgrade for a couple of years, and someone a smart laptop that you can always take with you wherever you go. <br><br>  <b>Successes and spectacular frags.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88953/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88953/</a></p>
