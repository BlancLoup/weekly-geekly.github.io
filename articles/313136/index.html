      Our team works in-house in Moscow and Voronezh and removed in different cities of Russia.  This motivation is applicable to all who work in a full-time company, regardless of location.  Separately, I want to note the high efficiency in the case of working with remote employees. <br><br>  Currently, the company employs more than 10 developers.  We have 10 coupon services, 2 mobile applications, an aggregator <a href="http://kupon.ru/">kupon.ru</a> , an ERP system, a sender who sends over 8 million emails a day, and a joint project, an analytical service <a href="http://gtmix.ru/">gtmix.ru</a> .  Each developer participates in 2 or more projects.  It operates the SCRUM department in Trello.  Daily rallies are divided by project and take place at exactly the appointed time. <br><br>  Developer effectiveness is measured in points.  For the convenience of collecting results, we use the plugin for trello: <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/scrum-for-trello/jdbcdblgjdpmfninkoogcfpnkjmndgje">Scrum for Trello</a> .  The score is formed from the speed coefficient of the team and the time spent on the task.  There is a simple, clear sign: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/deb/7e1/698/deb7e169831043429d8fc1208d6735ea.png"></div><br>  From practical experience, the team‚Äôs optimal speed ratio is 1.6.  So you understand, this is 5 hours of work of an employee per day or 1 point.  1 person / hour is the time spent writing code and obmazgovanie tasks.  The time spent reading books, coffee, tea and the like is not considered. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Points are divided into estimated and spent.  Assume points - this is how much the developer is going to spend on the task.  Spent points - this is how much the developer actually spent time.  It is important that the assessment that affects the salary is measured in points spent. <br><br>  The team works iteratively.  Iteration is 2 weeks.  A weekly employee must score 5 points.  In the iteration, respectively, 10 points.  At the end of 2 iterations, we run a demo, where a team of managers reports to the entire company for the results.  In the amount of 2 iterations, the employee must score 20 points. <br><br>  This is how a tablet might look like: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cf/b1c/7c1/2cfb1c7c10e54aa9aa245fd2d391a827.png"></div><br>  In our culture, it is quite strictly stated that we expect excellent results from an employee.  From the points directly depends on the increase in his salary.  Depending on the result, a coefficient is formed by which the salary increases: <br><br><ul><li>  Satisfactory (&lt;14 points): the salary does not increase </li><li>  Normal (14-16 points): salary increases 1.5 times </li><li>  Good (17-18 points): 1.7 times </li><li>  Excellent (&gt; 19): 2 times </li></ul><br>  The basic idea is that the employee is fixed only half the salary.  This motivation can be used if an employee wants a completely white salary, but not so efficiently. <br><br>  We turn to the most interesting.  To the name ‚ÄúMotivation of Karate‚Äù, why and where did it come from?  As we understand, it is not enough to count the points to determine the effectiveness of the developer.  For subjective evaluation, belts were invented.  The belt is a developer level.  The higher the level, the higher the belt.  Consider with examples, if an employee claims a salary of 80,000 rubles, I can offer him a belt: 5.  At the same time, after the trial period, we can agree on an increase to 90000 rubles (6 kyu).  If the developer will show excellent grades on points, and his results will meet our expectations, then we can agree on raising them 3 months after the completion of the trial period to 100,000 rubles (7 kyu). <br><br>  Belt system for regions: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/470/c24/f25/470c24f2566a4e83b38d1315f8f9bbe8.png"><br><br>  The company has a flexible schedule, while the employee must be in touch at least 8 hours a day.  This is an important rule that allows you not to worry that your employee will not be able to react when you need help from him.  For example, Ivan works from 9:00 to 18:00, at this time I expect that he will be in touch.  In this case, it is not necessary for me to control him for the tasks, as I am sure that he will score points made at the end of the day.  And at the daily rally will tell about their successes. <br><br>  So what we have: <br><br>  - an objective assessment, which marks the developer himself at the end of the task, expressed in points spent. <br>  - subjective assessment, which is formed on the basis of the real success of the employee, his compliance with the culture of the company and other factors. <br><br>  Perhaps you are all faced with the fact that the developer does not want to mark the time and drag the completed tasks in trello.  Now you can sleep peacefully, he is directly interested in this.  And if you have stage and code review, then enter one important rule: tasks that are not uploaded to production will not be counted as done.  As a result, at the end of the demo, at the presentation you can show real results without forcing the developers to pour anything. <br><br>  Here is a table with the real results of our employees: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/364/ea1/fb6/364ea1fb6f8f442182d049a017e98dfc.png"><br><br>  This motivation allows you to quickly identify inefficient employees.  Since they do not like to celebrate their successes, and as a result, they are ready to put up with low scores, which, of course, does not suit the company. <br><br>  From my own observations, I would like to note that the majority of employees honestly mark their points.  Perhaps you will come across an incorrect assessment of the task, but these are rather nuances that an effective manager should quickly identify. <br><br>  I share the link to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ITClY1mGA21k0uwrJRnoPwtz5vg90DwqIT1NB4-8b9U/edit">presentation</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/313136/">https://habr.com/ru/post/313136/</a></p>
