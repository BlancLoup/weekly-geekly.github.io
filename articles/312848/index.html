Through blood and tears, defeating all the problems with the fonts, testing the letter in all email clients, they completed the preparatory stages.  But is it important if this letter does not reach the addressee?  In this article I will tell you about 26 ways to increase the likelihood of successful delivery of the letter and its reading by the addressee. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bff/c1a/85d/bffc1a85de4f4350ae982a71a13ab237.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  So, what you don't need to do: </h3><br><h4>  <strong>1.</strong> Never buy a database of email-addresses </h4><br>  Today, for sale put up a great variety of a variety of databases of email-addresses.  And they may even have addresses of people who agreed to receive letters from someone, but not from you.  Thus, by sending them a letter, you (your domain and mail server) seriously risk getting blacklisted email providers.  Such databases often contain spam traps that are used to calculate and block spammers. <br><br><h4>  <strong>2.</strong> Never parse websites to collect email addresses. </h4><br>  Indeed, with the help of parsing sites, you can quickly build an email database.  However, sending letters to such addresses will inevitably entail getting your domain into the spam list.

    <h4>  <strong>3.</strong> Do not send emails to the email address if you have previously received a report on the impossibility of delivering a letter to it. </h4><br>  Email address can be blocked, deleted or simply specified with an error.  You can never deliver letters to these addresses, and repeated attempts to do so can significantly affect the reputation of your domain and mail server. <br><br><h4>  <strong>4.</strong> Do not use upper case when writing a letter or its subject. </h4><br>  Do not shout at people.  You can hear it anyway.  No one likes to read typed sentences. <br><br><h4>  <strong>5.</strong> Do not use many exclamation marks !!!!!! </h4><br>  Follow the rules of punctuation, and again, do not shout at people.  Letters containing a large number of exclamation marks are negatively perceived by spam filters, for example SpamAssassin. <br><br><h4>  <strong>6.</strong> Do not use video and javascript in your letters. </h4><br>  Most email clients will not appreciate your efforts and will not display the rich-media components in your letter. <br><br>  The same applies to javascript - even if you pass by spam filters, email clients will not be able to execute javascript, which you put in the letter. <br><br><h4>  <strong>7.</strong> Do not use forms in your letters. </h4><br>  Forms are not supported by any email client.  However, no one forbids you to add a button in the CTA letter with a link to your website. <br><br><h4>  <strong>8.</strong> Do not add attachments to the letter. </h4><br>  No need to add attachments to the letter.  If you want to send a doc or pdf file, it is better to upload it to your website and add a link to the letter. <br><br><h4>  <strong>9.</strong> Do not use spam words. </h4><br>  If you use the words "free", "only today", "last chance to buy", etc. in your mailings, you risk getting into "spam".  Be creative, think of something more original. <br><br><h4>  <strong>10.</strong> Do not use bold and colorful fonts in letters. </h4><br>  The same applies to the text placed on the background of the same color as the text itself and other spamming tricks.  Your email with a 99% chance will be blocked by spam filters. <br><br><h4>  <strong>11.</strong> Do not forget to check the spelling of the letter. </h4><br>  80% of respondents will negatively perceive your letter if it contains spelling and punctuation errors.  There are many good spell checker services, feel free to use them before sending your mailings. <br><br><h4>  <strong>12.</strong> Write letters for people, not for robots. </h4><br>  No need to add a large number of keywords in the letter.  Write letters in plain language, be creative, create interesting and necessary content. <br><br><h4>  <strong>13.</strong> Do not use a large number of images or "heavy" images. </h4><br>  Do not forget that many email clients can hide your images in order to save traffic.  Your letter should look beautiful and without an abundance of pictures.  In addition, if your images are ‚Äúheavy‚Äù, the letter will be loaded for a long time, and the recipient may simply not wait until the end of the download, closing the letter. <br><br><h3>  And now what you need to do: </h3><br><h4>  <strong>14.</strong> Keep your list of subscribers current </h4><br>  Even if your list is 100% made up of addresses that you received via opt-in, you can be considered a spammer if you do not follow the simplest recommendations of mail providers.  Remove the dead addresses from the list of subscribers in time, after sending to which you received bounced events.  Track the opening of letters, and if any of your subscribers does not open your letters, he probably no longer uses this email address and you can safely exclude him from his lists. <br><br><h4>  <strong>15.</strong> Use Double-Opt-In </h4><br>  When using Double-Opt-In authorization, you send a special letter to the subscriber with a link to activate his subscription.  Thus, you will get a completely legitimate subscriber interested in your letters. <br><br><h4>  <strong>16.</strong> Ask your subscribers to add you to their contact list. </h4><br>  If the addressee of your letter adds your address to your contact list, you are guaranteed to solve the problem of getting your letters in spam when sending to this box. <br><br><h4>  <strong>17.</strong> Always add a unsubscribe link to your email. </h4><br>  Each letter should contain a link to unsubscribe.  Ideally, a person can unsubscribe from your newsletter in one click, however, you can also post a small survey form on the opt-out page to find out why people no longer want to receive your letters. <br><br><h4>  <strong>18.</strong> Respect users who refuse your emails. </h4><br>  If a person refused to receive your newsletters, do not write to him again.  In addition, the process of unsubscribing should be as simple as possible - you should not require the user to log in to the site, perform any additional actions, etc.  One click, at most, a survey - and that's it. <br><br><h4>  <strong>19.</strong> Use the ‚Äúhuman‚Äù name and email address of the sender. </h4><br>  You should not send letters from addresses like info@example.com, sales@example.com and the like. Be closer to your subscribers!  It is much more pleasant for a person to receive a letter from a real person, and not from a soulless machine.  Addresses alex@example.com, dmitry@example.com, and others.  fit much better.  In addition, email providers will accept them more favorably. <br><br><h4>  <strong>20.</strong> Add subscriber name to subject </h4><br>  Postal providers perceive personalized letters better than impersonal ones.  By adding the subscriber‚Äôs name to the subject line, you will show that you know him and he is waiting for your letter. <br><br><h4>  <strong>21.</strong> If you are using HTML letters, do not forget about the plain-text version. </h4><br>  If you are sending HTML letters, you need to add a plain-text version of the letter.  This should be done for the following reasons: <br><br><ul><li>  Some email clients do not support HTML display. </li><li>  Many people prefer plain-text in order to save mobile traffic and increase the speed of downloading letters. </li><li>  Email providers love plain-text. </li></ul><br><h4>  <strong>22.</strong> Add a link to its online version. </h4><br>  Unfortunately, some email clients may incorrectly display your email.  In this case, you will help a special online version of the letter.  Usually a link to it is added at the top of the letter. <br><br><h4>  <strong>23.</strong> Do not forget to set the alt attributes of the images in your letter. </h4><br>  In some email clients, image display is disabled by default.  If you do not want your client to understand the meaning of your letter anyway, use the alt attributes of the images. <br><br><h4>  <strong>24.</strong> Be brief </h4><br>  Mail providers do not like spam filters from one-line letters, but they also do not like letters containing several thousand characters.  Be short and concise in your letters, use no more than 400-500 characters, divide the text into paragraphs, so that your subscribers can read it more easily. <br><br><h4>  <strong>25.</strong> Test the letters before sending </h4><br>  Do not forget to send a test mailing to several of your addresses before the combat dispatch, as well as test the display of the letter on several devices. <br><br>  According to Litmus service statistics, the following mail clients use the largest number of users: <br><br><ul><li>  Apple iPhone's Mail (28% of users) </li><li>  Gmail (16% of users) </li><li>  Apple iPad's Mail (11% of users) </li><li>  Google Android's Mail (9% of users) </li><li>  Outlook (9% of users) </li></ul><br><h4>  <strong>26.</strong> Keep track of your email server and domain reputation. </h4><br>  Services like MXToolbox allow you to track the reputation of your domain and the IP addresses of your mail server.  Do not forget to periodically check it, and if necessary take measures to exclude you from the black and gray lists of spam filters. <br><br>  That's all, I hope that this small list will help you to create and send more efficient email newsletters.  Have a good job! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312848/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312848/</a></p>
