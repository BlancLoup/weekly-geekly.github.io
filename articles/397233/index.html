For example, when it comes to the <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/ar-vr/oculus-rift.html">Oculus Rift</a> virtual reality helmet.  Many with him firmly entrenched all the associations with virtual reality. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Once, or rather, some two or three years ago, the Oculus was out of competition.  And many got used to it, which is why strong associative connections were born.  However, in the modern world everything changes very quickly.  And the undoubted leader of the past - Oculus Rift - today is forced to fight for its position against numerous competitors.  For example, with HTC's product, the HTC <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/ar-vr/htc-vive.html">Vive</a> helmet, which at first seemed expensive and heavy, but overall, a good competitor to Oculus. <br><br>  At the end of March this year, customers began to receive a custom version of the Oculus Rift, and we decided to try it out.  The copy was provided to us by Top 3D Shop, which we thank for the opportunity to test the new gadget.

      To say that Oculus and HTC Vive are very different in their parameters, it is impossible.  Their characteristics and requirements for a gaming installation are almost the same.  There is one requirement - the gaming computer must be very powerful.  But in games without it anywhere. <br><br>  However, the ‚ÄúOculus‚Äù has pleasant differences from the HTC.  For example, ease of installation.  The helmet can be connected to USB and HDMI connectors using a special cable.  Installing an infrared camera tracker will require two more USB inputs, and you need a wireless module to work with the XBox One. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d8/899/97a/2d889997ab6e4428a5692ca86e5d4713.png"><br><br>  What else is good about the Oculus Rift?  Headphones that are built into the helmet.  However, if you have little power, you can use your own by connecting them to the computer‚Äôs audio output. <br><br>  And most importantly - the visual and game content.  That's really something with what, and with this for Oculus there are no problems at all.  It is only important that you have the funds for it.  In general, carry your money, gentlemen, because for the steep chips for the "Rift" will have to fork out, although it is worth it.  Want to save a little, do not rush to the company online store Oculus.  All the same can be much cheaper to buy on Steam. <br><br>  We also decided to save, so we bought the best game of the season - the space quest ADR1FT.  By the way, the platformer Lucky's Tale in this case will be given to you for free if you bought a helmet.  And if you're a War Thunder fan, then this product will be free by default. <br><br>  We seemed the coolest of our adventures in the compartments of the destroyed space station.  The sensations were simply indescribable.  The plot of the game ADR1FT is quite simple: you will be in the role of an astronaut who suffers from complete loss of memory.  Therefore, in addition to repairing the rescue module, you have a lot to remember and to solve a lot of puzzles, for example, how to restore oxygen supply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afa/8ec/6d0/afa8ec6d074346669d95e0970b96d9f0.png"><br><br>  Another example of a game where you can use all the features of Oculus in full is the project Lucky's Tale.  It tells about the adventures of a fox Lucky.  We believe that this is probably the reference platform for VR helmets for today.  You will be fascinated by it no less than the legendary adventures of a plumber in the Mushroom Kingdom. <br><br>  War Thunder is familiar to many in the previous versions, however, after the famous game was specially upgraded to the requirements of VR devices, you will see everything in a completely new way, and the impressions will be even better and brighter.  The only drawback is the inability to connect full-fledged game controllers.  With their help, virtual battles would be even more interesting. <br><br>  By the way, we invited all these games to try out the famous youtube.  Which one  Watch the video‚Ä¶ ;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f21/fa3/972/f21fa39726d3449b916eb35219e8e0f9.png"><br><br>  So that our review did not seem too one-sided to you, we also decided not to ignore the drawbacks of the device.  If you compare it with a competitor - HTC Vive, then the absence of special controllers immediately catches the eye.  You can, of course, use a small remote with the installation of the Xbox One, but it will not always work.  Therefore, we want to test the already announced Oculus Touch as soon as possible. <br><br>  We would also like to note that without special controllers and with limited movement possibilities during the game, you can get not very pleasant feelings due to problems with the vestibular apparatus.  By the way, if you use the HTC Vive, then such troubles hardly threaten. <br><br>  And again we return to the positive moments in order to complete our review with a happy ending.  Although the Oculus is probably not very comfortable for owners of ordinary glasses, the helmet itself normally sits on its head and does not create discomfort.  Of course, the cost of the entire kit ‚Äî the helmet and the gaming station ‚Äî is not small, however, taking into account the specifics of the product, one can take its price almost as a plus. <br><br>  Well, one more plus - content.  For Oculus his cooked a lot, but the developers do not stop at this.  Moreover, Okulus has already released three versions of the helmet.  In general, the Oculus Rift is a solid, ready for diving into virtual reality gadget.  Probably, someone will call the first user version is not ideal, but this does not mean that this development will remain without the attention of users.  Therefore, we definitely recommend. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XJ2K0ewIHaQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Want more interesting news from the world of 3D technology? <br><br>  <b>Subscribe to us in the social.</b>  <b>networks:</b> <br><br> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b25/fce/eff/b25fceeffa904b06ba0818fdef351e77.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="https://vk.com/top3dshop"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c76/ee9/037/c76ee903753346c29abaa49280dfd828.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="https://www.instagram.com/top3dshop/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/098/e48/10d/098e4810d16b4941a38c8072653ef899.png"></a> <br><br> <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/ar-vr/oculus-rift.html%3Frs%3DCM_3d_print_vr_GT"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48b/6ce/a91/48b6cea91d604f3bb6d489567c26e8b9.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397233/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397233/</a></p>
