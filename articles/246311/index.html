Below I will try to briefly tell you what these models are, and how you can use them to build an ‚Äúideal cluster‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/716/df6/cce/716df6cce9b845e6b47075562c624e18.jpg"><br>  <i>In the photo - Nutanix NX-3460 with extracted ‚Äúnodes‚Äù -servers.</i>

      Although our mainstream NX-3000 is usually well suited for most typical use cases, there are some specialized areas that require sharpening solutions.  A good example is the Nutanix cluster node, which we call the NX-7110. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/25e/81e/42e/25e81e42e3c447a7a58d58f95ef63deb.jpg"><br><br>  This is a 2U case (all our models are 2U high, this simplifies placement), in which, unlike the NX3000, only one computational ‚Äúserver‚Äù is placed.  The reason for this is that this spacious ‚Äúserver‚Äù -noda has the opportunity to install three full-size PCIe 16x slots to accommodate <a href="http://blog.in-a-nutshell.ru/nvidia-grid-in-nx-7110/">professional 3D accelerators</a> , which can be used in VDI machines for ‚Äúheavy‚Äù graphical tasks previously considered unsuitable for VDI (professional CAD, 3D-modeling, video editing in HD), and also install the Teradichi Apex PCoIP acceleration card into such a node server, which significantly accelerates the responsiveness of the virtual desktop interfaces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ed0/92b/0fb/ed092b0fbc12428ca49e3ea3eb4601b8.jpg"><br><br>  We in Russia already have examples of the introduction of similar VDI, I hope, when it becomes possible, to tell about them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/873/a41/c7d/873a41c7d5e7451fa85765a26e7ea193.jpg"><br>  <i>In the photo - NX-7110 (closer) and NX-3460 (farther) in the process of unpacking and installing the cluster at the client</i> . <br><br>  As you remember, hyperconvergence means that our systems do not have separate servers and separate storage systems as separate entities familiar to SAN environments.  In Nutanix, the server and storage are merged together.  Each node carries a portion of ‚Äústorage‚Äù on its local disks, and Nutanix OS combines many such ‚Äúlocal disks‚Äù into the total disk space of the cluster. <br>  But in the case when you need more storage space than the NX-3000 node can provide, and there are already enough processors and processor capacity in principle, you can use our so-called ‚Äúcapacity nodes‚Äù, NX-6000 series.  These are the Nutanix nodes, which have more capacious disks, but not such productive processors as in the NX-3000.  In addition, a 2U chassis is used for two, not four server nodes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f46/784/ff6/f46784ff65264e97978c25f95ad59f20.jpg"><br><br>  Unlike the NX-3000, it uses the 3.5 "form factor discs. In addition, since the" big "discs take up more space, they are placed differently in the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/761/acb/60d/761acb60d32342e1a4f50e211acc1fbf.png"><br><br>  Otherwise, these are the same Nutanix nodes, you can include them in the same cluster with, for example, NX-3000 or NX-7000 nodes, and get extended storage capacity.  Next is the decision of the virtual machine cluster administrator, how to place virtual machines on a cluster of hosts (they can also be migrated between hosts on the fly).  You can place smaller VMs on the capacity of the nodes, or choose those that do not need such high processing power (for example, it can be a file server, or a VM for storing user home folders or network profiles).  However, do not underestimate the processor in the "Capacity node" dual-processor Xeon E5-26xx - not at all slack! <br><br>  However, there is a case when a task requires a powerful single server.  This can be a separate database that cannot be structurally parallelized across a cluster of nodes, and must be run on one server, or, for example, a powerful and capacious MS Exchange server for mailbox databases, calculated in the <a href="http://longwhiteclouds.com/2014/09/28/exchange-best-practices-and-1-4million-mailboxes-on-nutanix-nx-8150/">thousands and tens of thousands</a> .  For such a task in the arsenal of Nutanix is ‚Äã‚Äãa model NX-8150.  It is a single node ‚Äúserver‚Äù in 2U, similar to the NX-7110 already reviewed, but there are 24 discs in this node, 4 of them are 800GB SSD or 1.6TB SSD and 20 are SATA 1TB.  The processor is a dual E5-2697v2 (in top configuration) and up to 512GB of memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bac/b25/89d/bacb2589d1654bb5bf8899c65fad9237.jpg"><br><br>  If even this power is not enough, then you should look at the model of the NX-9000 series, which belongs to the extremely fashionable All-Flash today.  There are two nodes in one NX-9040 package, each with a pair of Intel Xeon Ivy Bridge E5-2690v2 (20 cores, 3.0 GHz), 256 or 512GB RAM, and 6 pieces per 800 800GB or 1.6TB SSD node. <br><br>  If, on the contrary, the power of the NX-3000 is excessive, and budgets are limited, then you can try to pay attention to the youngest series - the NX-1000.  In any case, Nutanix does not play in SMB, in any case it is a rather muscular enterprise, but, for example, the 1000 series models can be applicable.  E5-2620 is also far from Atom;), and is capable of a lot, but in the nodes of the "thousandth" series there is relatively little RAM, and note that from 12 to 16GB RAM will take you into memory Nutanix CVM, ensuring the work of the internal "kitchen" and the organization of Nutanix Distributed Filesystem. <br><br>  Let me remind, finally, that you can build a cluster of disparate ‚Äúbrick building‚Äù nodes, choosing them which are necessary for your tasks.  For example, you can take one four-block NX-3461 unit, for infrastructure VMs, for example, to place an AD domain controller, network management and deployment VM, VCenter and a couple of hundreds of VDI VM ‚Äúoffice class‚Äù for them, for your ordinary employees, to add NX-7110 with powerful professional 3D graphics to it, for CAD workstations and videos, and for MS Exchange mail system or Oracle powerful database, which requires a large amount of storage and many ‚Äúdisk spindles‚Äù to add one or several blocks to the cluster NX-8150. <br>  And the whole structure will have a single management, a total high-performance disk space, and can be expanded without limit by adding necessary blocks to this cluster, with the functionality you need. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/321/80c/567/32180c567818417cadf4e8b308eb2aba.png"><br><br>  And in the very near future, we are waiting for the update of the line with new processors and the expansion of configurations, primarily from memory.  As the saying goes: ‚ÄúWatch for advertising‚Äù :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246311/</a></p>
