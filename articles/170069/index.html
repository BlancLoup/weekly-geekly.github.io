It is called, contrary to all rumors, not M7 (it would be really strange), but One - without any prefixes and postfixes.  Here is a "one of a kind." <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nhf0qrWpmoY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiqA_NUBtTNcfPCwOYy6yWA1bebZw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It seems to many (and we are not an exception in NOMOBILE) that lately there are no highlights in HTC gadgets.  It seems that everything is within the framework of trends: gigahertz, permissions, core ... But there was nothing like that, why I would like to buy HTC for myself.  Model One seems to have broken stereotypes.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f4/1d4/9a6/1f41d49a662650fc4e990e175d8a1402.jpg"><br><br>  First, no matter what anyone says, the design really turned out to be fresh, although recognizable.  They did not go after super-thinness, but they made a long-proven move - the edges of the smartphone turned out to be rather thin - only 4 mm.  And in the ‚Äúthickest‚Äù part of the gadget is 9.3 mm. <br><br>  Regarding iron rumors are fully confirmed.  The Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 chipset was chosen as a hardware platform, which includes 4 cores operating at 1.7 GHz, as well as a couple of gigabytes of RAM and 32 GB of main memory.  Apparently, there is no expansion slot, but most likely the epic with 20 GB of free space on Dropbox will continue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/862/d90/e39/862d90e39ab83edd1faa0bb21d3a2f05.jpg"><br><br>  It follows from the above that the device (well, or rather, Snapdragon 600) supports ALL new wireless standards.  Naturally, there is a 3G module, but along with it is LTE, and the frequencies that are used in Russia are also supported.  In addition, the smartphone can work with new Wi-Fi routers that support the new IEEE 802.11 ac.  In addition to this, Bluetooth fourth version and NFC are worth noting. <br><br>  Now about the screen.  Looks like a record!  468 dots per inch ... I will not say that it will be very useful to the user, but no one will stick to the quality of the picture.  On the diagonal of 4.7 inches fits the resolution of 1920x1080. <br><br>  But the main features of the device are cool sound and camera.  Especially for this business even came up with a new brand Boomsound.  The user is a bit confused by this name, but in practice it resulted in two powerful speakers on the front panel.  An amplifier is also present.  Well, Beats Audio with all these equalizers has not gone anywhere.  And yet declared noise reduction system Sense Voice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98d/1ef/461/98d1ef461e3474509078263454a744b1.jpg"><br><br>  The camera on paper seems no less cool.  Yes, and Nikolay Turubar, who went to London for a presentation, tweeted: ‚ÄúThe bird on the tail brought info, that the camera on the HTC M7 would be SUCH, that Nikon and Canon stocks would make a record drop.‚Äù But they don‚Äôt take test shots. supposedly the software is not final.  In general, as always. <br><br>  The following is officially known: the pixel size on the HTC One camera sensor is 2 micrometers, ImageChip 2 is responsible for image processing, and the viewing angle of the 28-mm lens is 88 degrees.  The aperture value is F2.0. <br><br>  Among other things, HTC trumps the ability to record video in FullHD format using HDR, as well as recording videos at high speed, with a sharp Slow Motion output.  In all of this, the multi-axis optical stabilizer will help the user, which is good news. <br><br>  The software responsible for controlling the camera still allows you to take a photo while recording video, and in addition, ‚Äúrich editing and retouching features were added with the removal of unwanted objects, the layout of smiles, the overlapping of objects to get the motion path, etc.‚Äù <br><br>  Well, the curtain HTC One pleased with a rather capacious 2300 mAh battery, which allows you to hope for 10-12 battery life.  If we recall the presentation of Qualcomm's new chips at the last CES 2013 exhibition, it does not seem impossible, even if we take into account the screen resolution, LTE and various background software technologies that are also constantly being asked to eat. <br><br>  In short, HTC managed to make the device, which at least in the near future became the coolest on the market.  New Qualcomm processor, super-density of pixels on the screen, new communication standards, sound, camera.  There is something to spend money on.  But unfortunately, no one has yet called the official Russian price. <br><br><h4>  Specs </h4><br>  <b>OS:</b> Android 4.1 Jelly Bean <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Qualcomm Snapdragon 600, 4 cores, 1.7 GHz <br>  <b>Video:</b> Adreno 320 overclocked <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 2 GB <br>  <b>Main memory:</b> 32-64 GB, no microSD slot <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 4.7 ", S LCD 3, 1080 x 1920 <br>  <b>Communications:</b> LTE, 3G, Wi-Fi (a / ac / b / g / n), Bluetooth 4.0, NFC, USB 2.0 <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> USB (MHL), 3.5mm audio jack <br>  <b>Camera:</b> 4 megapixels.  + 2.1 megapixels. <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS, GPS, GLONASS <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 2300 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 137.4 x 68.2 x 9.3 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 143 grams <br>  <b>Price:</b> ~ 30k rubles in March </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170069/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170069/</a></p>
