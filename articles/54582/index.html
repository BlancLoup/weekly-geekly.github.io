  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Idea: Karmagram or chart ranking mechanism for social networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not everyone represents what chart ranking is, so first a bit of theory: <br><br>  <b>Chart ranking method.</b> <br>  Unlike the usual ranking methods based on mixing all qualities into one and presenting them as a number (Karma is an example of this), the essence of karmagram is in listing all the qualities inherent in a subject, evaluating each of them separately, and conveniently representing the multidimensional the pictures. <br><img src="http://dolphin-gps.ru/images/re/diarramma_s.jpg" alt="image"><br>  As we can see, the picture strongly resembles a pie chart - each color corresponds to a certain quality - ‚ÄúStupidity‚Äù, ‚ÄúMind‚Äù, ‚Äúknows C ++‚Äù, etc.  In the future, I will call it ‚Äúkarmagramma‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>Coloring</i> <br>  A karmagram can be understood as a collection of opinions expressed on a subject.  Opinion is a tag, any word or combination of several words that the user considers characteristic of the subject.  Opinion can be ‚Äúsimple‚Äù - to describe something concrete, and ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù, which is understood as a certain set of simple opinions, without breaking it into components.  This division is of course conditional, any opinion is both simple and complex.  Difficult opinions will arise where it is difficult for the user to imagine the subject figuratively, but the opinion has developed (‚ÄúLike‚Äù), simple where a certain image (‚ÄúPHP expert‚Äù) immediately appears associatively.  In an ideal karmagram, the number of ‚Äúsimple‚Äù opinions tends to infinity, and the number of ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù to zero. <br><img src="http://dolphin-gps.ru/images/re/draw_s.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Prisms.</i> <br>  The person well perceives pie charts with the number of colors not more than 2-3-4.  A set of colors of a karmagram can significantly exceed this value.

    <img src="http://dolphin-gps.ru/images/re/prizma_s.jpg" alt="image"><br>  By grouping or screening har-ki, a prism allows you to see only the important qualities and instantly evaluate them.  Prisms can be easily changed and created new ones.  Prisms allow you to look at an object from different angles, it is they who make karmagrams useful and usable. <br><br>  With the introduction of prisms, the essence of karmograms should be determined beforehand ‚Äî by decomposing a subject into the maximum number of simple har-ik, we always have the opportunity to collect them in 2-3-4 sv-va assessment of which is most effective within a separate task. <br><br>  Who was interested in the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãchart ranking, but it seemed to be little information, they can look at <a href="http://milif.habrahabr.ru/blog/54186/">this</a> topic, there are more thoughts on multidimensional evaluation. <br><br>  <b>Now about the project.</b> <br>  The idea is to provide a ‚Äúwidget‚Äù (not sure of the definition) - a tool that is easily embedded in any web project that allows users to rank users and content in a diagrammatic way.  Tobish each object will receive a karmogram and each user of this network will be able to color it.  There will also be available prisms and other, not yet invented, tools for working with karmagrams. <br>  The widget is traditionally integrated - through javascript and server-side interface-class, both libraries have a documented API. <br><br>  <i>Why a widget?</i> <br>  - Chart "karmograph", rather a complex mechanism than a simple one.  I think it is closer to search engines, many issues of miscalculation and the issuance of karmagrams are not straightforward, the search for the optimal solution is more a permanent process than a one-time action + the presence of peripheral functionality, without which there is nowhere (prisms, etc.).  The possibility of replicating a karmograph with a logically complete module to a certain CMS or library is in doubt. <br>  - A little imagination - the creation of a search engine based on ‚Äúsociometric‚Äù data (karmagrams) of objects registered in the system, which are the users and the content marked by karmagrams of all the networks that installed the widget. <br><br>  <i>Platform - Google App Engine.</i> <br>  Respectively Python (Django), and GWT under client side. <br><br>  <i>Open source</i> <br>  Yes, the project is open.  All code that can be opened will be opened.  All those who wish to actively participate in the development of the project have this opportunity by starting work on one of the tasks.  All active participants receive a share of the monetization of the project. <br><br>  <i>Monetization.</i> <br>  There are many possibilities.  I don‚Äôt want to focus on this issue now. <br><br>  <b>Are social networks interested in using chart rankings and installing this widget?</b> <br>  Rather Yes, or rather No, what do you think? <br>  By ‚Äúinterested‚Äù we understand that the functioning of the network (from its personal point of view) when using the widget will become more efficient.  Conditions for installing the widget has not yet been determined.  I do not exclude the option of displaying an ad unit in a widget, i.e.  A web project, if it wants, can twist and get some kind of reward for advertising, perhaps this will be an additional incentive to introduce chart rankings. <br><br>  <b>The initiative group is for those who want, and if the idea sustains brainstorming.</b> <br>  Those who wish to open a project can write to me in a personal (or according to the contacts specified in the profile), I promise to acquaint all of us with each other (you can arrange a meeting in Skype), decide who participates, in what role, and say Let's go!  ) <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> I ask you not to consider a pie chart as a cornerstone, this is just a way to explain the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãusing multidimensional evaluation in a clear language - and what they will eventually use, a secondary question, perhaps not only circles but also rectangles, cones, or bagels. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54582/</a></p>
