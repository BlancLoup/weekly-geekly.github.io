Read, watched, analyzed.  He could not believe his eyes, he threw denyuzhek on the stock exchange to check and touch with his hands. <br>  I was thinking about mining at the end of April of this year, when the course of Bitcoin once again began to rise sharply.  I figured on the calculator how much money can be earned on this, and decided to assemble a car with 4 video cards separately for bitcoin mining, then, according to my calculations, the investments should have paid off in 1-2 months.  While there is almost no risk, if the ‚Äúpyramid‚Äù is covered, the iron can always be sold. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf1/21d/3a9/bf121d3a903938ea5ef24deaaa30ce81.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Configuration of the first computer: <br><ul><li>  MSI 890FXA-GD70 motherboard 4 900 RUB. </li><li>  AMD Phenom II X4 processor 925 3 430 RUB. </li><li>  SAMSUNG DDR3 memory module - 2GB 680 RUB. </li><li>  Hard Drive SEAGATE Barracuda Green 2TB 2,260 RUB. </li><li>  Video card GIGABYTE Radeon HD R6950 x 3 pcs.  7 330 RUB. </li><li>  GIGABYTE Radeon HD 5870 Video Card 6 260 RUB. </li><li>  Power supply unit THERMALTAKE 1000W 6 110 RUB. </li></ul><br>  As a result, the first computer cost 45.5 thousand rubles.  and gave out 1.5 GigaHesh / s.

      Radeon 6950 is not the most profitable mining card, in my opinion it is better to take 5870 from single-chip cards, it is cheaper and gives more than 6950 when overclocked to 50 megaheshs. <br><br>  Gathered set up and the money flowed into the wallet, remembering the week, and despite the fact that the course was growing rapidly at that time, I decided to buy another car.  I searched the web for used 5970 which are currently the best for mining, but are no longer available.  Found 4 pieces on average 15 thousand rubles.  and bought.  The second computer came out ~ 80 thousand rubles.  and had a capacity of 2.6 GHsh / s. <br><br>  At first, everything looked like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40c/533/bc8/40c533bc8e2267a7be5f7a1b3775c5a2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The distance between the video cards turned out to be very small, and therefore the cards were very hot.  Ordered in China extenders for PCI-E.  And when they were sent made a rack of aluminum corners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/533/82a/ac2/53382aac2d481e678f5673482083f97a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It turned out pretty well, and solved the problem with overheating: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d23/add/9bb/d23add9bb70b56a3f26dcfec8d4d4abf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The 1.5 kW unit was not enough for four 5970, we had to change 5970 and 6950 between the computers, and add the old 350 watt power supply separately for 6950. <br><br>  The course continued to grow and one day reached 32 bucks for bitcoin.  A day later I bought the third computer with four 6990 to 22 thousand rubles.  a piece.  It turned out about 100 thousand rubles.  and on it the speed of selecting hashes without overclocking is 2.8 GHsh / s. <br>  After installing the third computer, even the tightly closed door stopped saving from the noise in the apartment, I had to move everything to the balcony. <br><br>  It eats all about 5 kW or ~ 20 A. According to the current tariff for electricity, it comes out ~ 10 thousand rubles.  per month.  The total capacity is ~ 7 gigabytes per second, with the current complexity of about 5 coins per day. <br><br>  As an OS I use Ubuntu, the miner of phoenex, put Zabbix for monitoring. <br><br>  As a result, for all the time I managed to extract about 350 bitcoins, which at the current rate (15 USD) equals ~ 150 thousand rubles.  The truth is, while most of the earnings are stored in Bitcoins, and real money was withdrawn by about 50 thousand rubles.  I hope for a bright future for bitcoins, and I‚Äôm waiting for the course to be $ 100 per coin.  But lately, the course is somehow not at all happy, now I would not risk starting and buying a new iron for mining.  With the current complexity and the course, the payback period is more than 3 months, this is without taking into account the fact that the complexity rises every 10 days, and the course may even fall. <br><br>  References: <br>  <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison">Iron Comparison for Mining</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://bitcoinx.com/profit/index.php">Calculator for calculating profit and payback time</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/">Information on courses on various exchanges</a> <br><br>  Working exchanges for selling bitcoins: <br>  <a href="https://www.bitcoin7.com/%3Fref%3D6414">Bitcoin7</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.tradehill.com/%3Fr%3DTH-R1849">TradeHill</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Category:Pool_Operators">Co-generation pools</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122755/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122755/</a></p>
