  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúI am an ordinary stylus for capacitive screens‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  My name is ... Oh, and I don‚Äôt even know my name!  There is absolutely nothing written on me, although on the package, in which I have been writing something for a long time, but that is clearly not my name.  It seems there is an inscription "deppa", but for some reason I think that this is just the name of the company that sells me.  In general, I myself am from Taiwan and there at the factory, where I come from, they do everything that they order and do it exactly as they order.  I am sure that my colleagues and I were planning to make high-quality ones, but at the same time so that we would not be much overhead for our owners.  Moreover, our mission is not so serious and important, but it can be said for sure that for many we will be very comfortable.  We will often be held in hand and led by a soft tip on a capacitive display. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I don‚Äôt remember exactly how long I was in my transparent package, from which I watched the lid of the counter most of the time.  I did not even deign to hang in a prominent place.  A couple of times I was taken out of the packaging, but these were people who hoped that I would help them with their devices equipped with resistive displays.  Disappointed in me, they chose sharp and hard guys.  They lay next to me, and found their owners much more often.  Sometimes I envied them, but I was sure that my finest hour would come ... <br><br>  And so, a few days ago I had a boss!  But he almost passed by: the sales assistant who worked in the store where they were selling me, seems to understand nothing in touch displays and stylus pens.  And when my future owner asked if there were styluses for capacitive touchscreen displays, he began to offer my neighbors in the window, which were designed for outdated touchscreens.  Anton (that is my host's name) had to bend over and look at the assortment of styluses, which were so few, but he saw me, asked to free me from the packaging, and began to drive me on the big screen.  Then I saw that on the back of the device was a black, shiny apple-shaped logo.  But when I was designed, such large non-keyboard devices with the apple logo were not, because even on the front of the package it was written what I was created for: ‚ÄúStylus universal for iPhone and iPod touch‚Äù.  Then I was upset and thought that I wasn‚Äôt coming up again, but what was my surprise when Anton took out seven hundred and something rubles and gave them to the unfortunate seller. <br><br>  My host carefully returned me to the package and put it in his bag next to an unknown gadget, the screen of which was covered with some kind of strange soft case.  The edge of the case continually magnetized my metal clothespin until, despite the plastic wrapping, I stuck strongly to it.  In the dark, I gave up and ceased to offer resistance, and, under the lulling movements of the walk, I fell soundly asleep.

      The bright light of an unfamiliar room quickly woke me up.  When I fully recovered, I was already in the hands of the owner's wife.  She described me as ‚Äúcool‚Äù and I was very flattered.  For several minutes, Anton‚Äôs wife used me to play some kind of colorful game: I helped her move the colorful figures so that three identical colors and shapes were lined up.  She so easily and naturally moved me on the bright screen that I was a little sick.  But it was a heady rocking motion, which I generally liked and I realized that I would soon get used to it. <br><br>  Some time later, I again felt that I was in the hands of Anton.  With the help of me, he clicked on a blue icon with the inscription Bamboo Paper and began to write something gracefully on a completely white surface.  He wrote something meaningless, the more he did it to test me, but it worked out quite nicely and smoothly: <br><br><img src="http://pix.am/Eb4h.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Later, I realized that the blue icon was run exclusively for the test, since at the moment we have written most of the text in another program, under which Noteshelf was written.  At the bottom of the screen, Anton wrote big and boldly, but in the end it turned out neatly and finely, because of this, there was a lot of text on one page: <br><br><img src="http://pix.am/yNX0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Recently, Anton met with his friend, who has the same device.  And then I learned that before me he had tried many other styluses: some were too cheap and broke as soon as they were taken in hand, others cost unreasonably expensive and this repelled.  According to my host, I was just what I needed: nothing superfluous, and everything was done very well.  Here are a couple of my pictures: <br><br><img src="http://pix.am/CggT.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://pix.am/FEkG.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122311/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122311/</a></p>
