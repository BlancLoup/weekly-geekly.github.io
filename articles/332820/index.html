Most of our clients do not administer the server, and for them the value of quality support is very high. <br><br>  We have conjured over the support for 15 years: they changed in details and arranged revolutions.

      When a project is young and customers are few, it is easier to provide great support.  The first years at FirstVDS this involved the entire project team.  In addition to their main work, the employees solved technical, financial and other issues of customers.  They knew by heart all customers, their sites and problems. <br><br>  By 2005, technical support began to take shape - 4 people were hired.  The load was small, and they coped perfectly - they answered quickly and completely. <br><br>  Technical advice was free, setup and installation - paid.  Technicians worked in shifts and performed certain tasks at a fixed cost.  Website transfer - so much, script optimization - so much, etc. <br><br>  General issues (activation of services, accounts, order processing) were decided by another department - in work with clients.  It consisted of 2 people.  Department staff also answered questions with finances and documents.  Solved all their tasks for free. <br><br>  Letters and calls were received by the customer service department and, if a technical question, was transmitted to the support.  Requests that came through the personal account (LK), saw both departments - chose their own and processed in the ticket office. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d37/17d/eba/d3717deba3fe47b2ab28e0c69e9544a4.png"><br><br>  In 2008, customers have become much more.  6 experts could not cope. <br><br><h3>  2008 - 2010: Staying cool is harder. </h3><br>  <b>The average number of requests per month - 2302 (+1762)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Average response time - 8 min (-18 min)</b> <br><br>  The number of requests has increased, and with it the response time.  To respond as quickly and efficiently, we hired more people: three in the customer service department and four in technical support.  The departments worked according to the old scheme. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/377/1c8/27e/3771c827ebaf46e7a35fb48f31c82280.png"><br><br>  Average response time decreased by 3 times!  But customers increasingly complained that the technical work is paid. <br><br><blockquote>  Yes ... a little more, and your service will be just as crap as everyone else.  Money is fighting for everything.  I recommend to set a commission to replenish the account, to launch passwd and another for each login in ISPmanager </blockquote><br>  We periodically lowered prices and, finally, decided that free technical support was an excellent competitive advantage. <br><br><h3>  2011 - 2012: An endless queue of tickets </h3><br>  <b>The average number of requests per month - 3322 (+1020)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Average response time - 27 minutes (+19)</b> <br><br>  To beat the competition, we made tech support free.  Only complex technical works remained paid - software installation and configuration, transfer of sites and databases. <br><br>  We foresaw that there will be a lot of tickets, and the response rate will decrease.  Customers will be unhappy because they are used to getting a response faster.  Then we entered the queue - when the customer sees the number in the queue, he estimates the approximate response time. <br><br>  The queue was formed by weight.  Customers who have been with us for longer, pay more and ask less, and new and problem ones (well, there are such) got to the top of the queue. <br><br>  It was possible to get up in the queue for money: to the beginning - 200 rubles, for the first in line - 50 rubles.  Clients with urgent problems could resolve the issue in an expedited manner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/480/947/321/480947321994429e96cf234089e44fe7.png"><br><br>  The problem is that the clients at the end of the queue almost never moved higher.  They are constantly overtaken by those who paid extra.  Or even the ‚Äúold and expensive ones‚Äù came, and the end of the line moved further and further.  To answer all, we accelerated and lost in quality.  As a result, they still answered insufficiently quickly and fully. <br><br>  The problem with a huge queue had to be addressed. <br><br><h3>  2013 - harsh sorters </h3><br>  <b>Number of requests per month - 3853 (+531)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Average response time - 27 (+0)</b> <br><br>  To respond quickly, efficiently and not to offend customers at the end of the queue, we did a few things. <br><br>  The first is that <b>they have returned paid technical support</b> , but in a new form.  They added two packages, they acted for a month and included the solution of several problems of server administration.  "Basic" cost 250 rubles., Included the solution of 5 tasks and assumed the answer within 24 hours, "Premium" - 10 tasks for 2000 rubles.  and answer in 5 hours.  The latter was soon abandoned, it was not claimed. <br><br>  Secondly, the <b>customer service department was split into two</b> : the finance department and the sales department.  Prior to this, financial, pre-sales and general issues were decided by the same people and mainly served existing customers.  After separation, the sales department was able to pay more attention to potential customers. <br><br>  The third - <b>entered a paid call to admins</b> .  There were more requests, and technical specialists did not have time to communicate with everyone by phone.  The toll line has unloaded admins.  Customers were able to solve urgent issues 2-3 times faster. <br><br>  The fourth and most important thing - they <b>added to the technical support the first line - sorters</b> .  They communicated with customers by phone.  They responded in tickets to general and simple technical questions, for example, to which name servers the domain is running.  Pre-sales, financial and complex technical issues were transferred to the relevant departments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c65/9f2/c8c/c659f2c8cfe148499dd45d66dd6ea9c1.png"><br><br>  We decided that the task at the first line is simple - specialists with higher education and deep technical knowledge are not needed there.  They recruited just good guys with the desire to work.  They wrote 10 templates and especially did not learn. <br><br>  We thought that after sorting technical support, finance and sales will receive only targeted requests, and the speed of responses will increase.  But the expectations were not met.  It turned out the same line, but in other departments - customers again resented. <br><br>  The second reason for customer dissatisfaction is communication problems.  All requests first fell the first line.  Now it is clear that there clients should be ‚Äúmet‚Äù by polite and attentive consultants.  But the face of the company was the sorters, who responded according to a template or transferred to another department.  If they could not help, they did not know how to explain the reason.  They communicated dryly and officially, answered only in the case.  Their task was to transfer tickets, to communicate with clients, sorters were not taught. <br><br>  We were upset, but did not refuse to divide into several lines.  The idea was good, it remains to make the first line more friendly and functional. <br><br><h3>  2014 - customer service </h3><br>  <b>The average number of requests per month - 4105 (+252)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Average response time - 19 min (-8)</b> <br><br>  The sorters could not cope with their task, and we made a customer care department from the first line.  The whole essence of the changes in the name - we have trained sorters to communicate with customers.  And scored 5 new employees. <br><br>  We developed an introductory course, wrote a detailed time limit.  We started every month to listen to calls, create call scripts.  Supporters have become polite, friendly and pleasant to talk to. <br><br>  The competence of the first line has expanded.  General issues were transferred to the customer care department, simple technical issues were added, for example, creation of a domain on the server.  Employees answered in tickets and by phone. <br><br>  In the same year we added chat to the site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1af/32e/54f/1af32e54ff3440ef8fbff282fd64a123.png"><br><br>  Technical support updated its regulations, and a number of technical issues of medium complexity hung in the air.  For example, installing PHP extensions, software on the server, the definition of malicious scripts that send spam.  The first line did not know how to respond to them, the second did not have time. <br><br><h3>  2015 - technical consultants between two fires </h3><br>  <b>Number of requests per month - 5040 (+827)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Average response time - 33 minutes (+14 minutes)</b> <br><br>  A year later, there was a conflict between the customer care department and tech support.  Supporters were trained to solve common and simple technical issues.  They closed about 40% percent of the tickets, but qualitatively.  However, technical issues are more complicated than the support providers passed on to the admins for whom these questions were too simple. <br><br>  Admins believed that the first line could cope with such nonsense.  The first line did not consider these issues nonsense.  Then we added technical consultants.  These guys became a buffer between the first line and the admins.  They took on the technical issues of average complexity - tasks that can be solved in 15 minutes.  The duties of the consultants included assistance when the server service crashes (Apache, Nginx), incorrectly configured permissions on the site files, errors with indication of database connection parameters, etc. <br><br>  Difficult technical issues (replacement of IP-addresses, transfer of sites / databases, setting up backup, etc.) consultants transmit to admins. <br><br>  With the addition of another support line, it took extra time to transfer tickets.  The speed of responses has decreased, but their quality has increased.  Most importantly, the emergence of technical consultants unloaded admins, the conflict with the first line was removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/efb/148/ff6/efb148ff669345e1869ce17b4fb3c97f.png"><br><br>  We solved general, pre-sales, financial, simple and medium technical issues for free.  Closed about 80% of tickets.  But customers still indignant that our support is paid. <br><br><h3>  2016 - paid or free support? </h3><br>  <b>The average number of requests per month - 7002 (+1962)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Average response time - 17 min (-16 min)</b> <br><br>  Support has always been free.  We carried out only a part of the technical works for money and gradually narrowed down this list.  Paid assistance never covered the cost of maintaining support; its goal was not earnings, but a reduction of requests in which our assistance is not really required. <br><br>  By 2016, first-line assistance and technical consultants were free, but even this did not satisfy customers. <br><br>  We studied the competitors and realized that the matter is in the name.  Renamed the complex technical support in administration - cognitive dissonance disappeared, customers stopped swearing. <br><br>  In the same year, the department of quality fully earned.  In 2015, we analyzed the reasons for leaving customers, corrected what depended on us.  By the end of the year, they introduced a system for evaluating chats and tickets - likes / dislikes from customers.  The task of the quality department was to verify the correctness and completeness of the answers, the validity of the assessment by the client.  According to the result, the support staff began to fine or encourage financially.  Support began to respond even more qualitatively, and thanks to motivation, and 5 new employees are also 2 times faster. <br><br><h3>  2017 - phone sex is now free </h3><br>  <b>The average number of requests per month is 6458 (-544)</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Average response time min 14 (-3)</b> <br><br>  A similar story turned out with a paid technical support line.  Customers called 8-800, heard ‚ÄúIf you want to discuss a technical issue ... stay on the line.  The cost of the call is 45 rubles per minute.  without VAT".  Clients hung up and went to write negative reviews. <br><blockquote>  Colleagues from VDS, and you are all right?  45 rub for a minute to talk with tech support?  Phone sex is cheaper.  Brrrr </blockquote><br>  They considered all technical support on the phone toll, because they were not listening to the voice menu - <br>  "... or wait until your call is transferred to Customer Care." <br><br>  We thought about how to change the voice menu - eventually abandoned the toll line. <br>  Now, to talk to the admin, you need to call customer care.  If the question is complex and urgent, the staff will connect with the admin. <br><br>  This is the last change in FirstVDS support for today, but not the last in the history of the project.  For 15 years we have been changing to become clearer, closer and more convenient.  The main criterion for change is your response. <br><br>  Every year you have more and more - it is more and more difficult to take into account the opinion of everyone, to respond quickly and efficiently, but we try. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/821/7cc/d6b/8217ccd6b865420bbb704a4e93ad5c9a.png"><br><br>  Over the past 2 years, FirstVDS support has doubled.  Now in 3 lines 37 people.  We attend courses, listen to calls, measure the response time.  We supplement the regulations, use the employee motivation system. <br><br>  For 15 years, we have changed a lot, but there is still where to strive.  Support FirstVDS scolded and praised.  We use constructive criticism to become better, and we rejoice in warm words.  Put us likes / dislikes in tickets, write <a href="https://firstvds.ru/company/feedback">reviews on the site</a> - we need your response. <br><br>  Do you want details on how FirstVDS support works now, why do we think the turnover is positive, and how many managers left the support?  We are thinking about another article about support.  Write in the comments that you are interested. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/332820/">https://habr.com/ru/post/332820/</a></p>
