  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hi, Habr!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0106c9d5/d80fd333/63ff7cc7/41f9d201.jpg" align="right">  Tomorrow, September 9, marks 20 years since the first cell phone call in Russia - and from today on, Beeline will be closer and more accessible to you.  What is important, we will be able to clearly respond to all the wishes of the habrasoobshchestva and generally we will listen to your opinion regarding our work. <br><br><h3>  Hello, who did they connect me to? </h3><br>  My name is Ekaterina Turtseva, I am the Beeline brand communications manager.  Immediately after this post, I will hand over the word to our technical experts, who in the company's blog on Habr√© will talk about the unusual things that we do or have done in the field of communication technologies.  September 15 of our company turns 19 years old - and we definitely have something to tell about the most different cases during this time. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h3>  What do we expect from the community? </h3><br>  - <b>First, the questions.</b>  We are ready to talk about solar-powered base stations, about how we deployed Wi-Fi on a ship with a bunch of bloggers, and so on.  We have a lot of well-trained technicians, each of whom can tell something about his work.  If you are wondering where the base station in the metro is, how Beeline opposes the fraud, why cell phones are badly taken in the hands of some people and other similar things - just write in the comments: we will either respond immediately or look at the topic in detail. <br>  - <b>Secondly, bug reports and wishes</b> .  We have a special service that deals with client requests, its mail is pomogite@beeline.ru.  Immediately I say - according to the rules of the company, only an appeal to this box is considered to be a bugreport or complaint, so writing in the comments is simply not constructive.  If you have something critical, you can duplicate the ticket number to me personally - this will speed up the process a bit.  In general, remember this box: any appeal to it must be considered and processed, and this rule is observed very strictly. <br>  - <b>Thirdly, work</b> .  Here are the <a href="">main vacancies</a> .  If you want to work with us for any job that is not on the list, send a resume to the mail NKsenz@beeline.ru (Ksenz Natalia, senior IT recruiting specialist). <br>  - <b>Fourthly, we need beta testers for various new products.</b>  I imagine what people from the community can do with new devices (I recently got a topic where a laptop was pulled down a snow slide and dropped from the second floor), so I think we will work together.  You can register in beta testers directly in the comments to the topic (just specify the city if it is not in the profile).  It works this way: experts will collect applications, and when something interesting will appear on your profile and in your city, we will immediately contact you for an invitation to the test.  All large public tests in addition will be separately highlighted on Habr√©.

    <h3>  Look at the iron </h3><br>  In late September, we invite everyone to inspect the mobile base station - this is a cell that is installed on the truck.  It is now used to increase coverage density at public events, plus it can be used to work in remote locations and in emergency situations.  Quite an unusual and expensive thing that drives smart phones to determine the position of the base stations of the cellular network.  On the tour you can take pictures and ask any questions to technicians.  Exact data on the place and time - a little later, right on Habr√©, in the "Events". <br><br><h3>  Summary </h3><br>  At this point, I give the floor to the technical specialists of the company.  All subsequent posts that will be posted on this blog are written by real technical staff of our company who face different difficulties and unusual things every day. <br><br>  So, bug reports - on pomogite@beeline.ru, questions on technologies, suggestions on topics, marks about the desire to participate in beta testing - here in the comments, fit into the tour - in the appropriate event (later). <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  Given the general trend of the discussion, several important points: <ol><li>  I am not a technical specialist, so all questions, requests and suggestions in the topic are transferred to the heads of the relevant departments.  Some answers will come rather slowly. </li><li>  All requests for the company will be considered when discussing the strategy.  In this case, I am the mediator between you and the management.  And yes, I already felt the habra effect on me. </li><li>  Once again: it is useless to write about specific issues in the comments.  For them, customer service is responsible, which has clear points of appeals, taking control.  One of these points is the already mentioned box pomogite@beeline.ru. </li><li>  There were a lot of questions about the hardware.  Appropriate specialists are invited to Habr, who will soon begin to talk about the infrastructure and features of various things that we do. </li><li>  I am very glad that we are developing a constructive dialogue on a number of discussion threads regarding development prospects.  We have already learned a lot from your feedback and are ready to introduce new features and processes.  However, remember, this process is not days or weeks - much of the company is planned for longer periods.  Nevertheless, by the constructive we have heard you and will change. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128015/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128015/</a></p>
