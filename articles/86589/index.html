    <a name="habracut"></a>  So, we have before us a great and terrible "Corvette PK-8010" of the 89th year of release.  His heart is the KR580VM80A, a complete hardware clone of a no less great and terrible i8080A (I note, not the i8080 itself - for it can only be considered a complete clone of the K580IK80, which was produced in a planar case). <br><br><img alt="KR580VM80A" src="http://img138.imageshack.us/img138/9885/cpuak.jpg"><br><br>  The Corvette was developed in the second half of the 80s (the beginning of the development is the end of 1985) by the employees of the Institute of Nuclear Physics at Moscow State University: Sergei Akhmanov, Nikolai Roy and Alexander Skurikhin, and was originally intended to automate the control of the installation by remotely measuring low-temperature plasma parameters using methods laser spectroscopy, as well as for processing the received information and theoretical calculations, maintaining a data archive, and similar purposes.  Subsequently, however, it was decided to equip all general education institutions in the country with this machine to learn the basics of computer literacy - and the car went into circulation in the 88th year. <br><br>  Unfortunately, on its own, the Corvette was very late ‚Äî almost a decade and a half, and the powers that be at that time didn‚Äôt understand at all why it was worth spending quite tangible money on a computer whose production requires such complexities as, for example, PCB abroad (this is indirectly indicated by the nameplate with the date of production of the board in English - so, for example, on my copy), or the purchase of expensive components in the same place, the production of which was mastered in Sovka only by the 88th year (before For example, the entire ROM in Corvettes b  Hungarian or Polish made). <br><br>  Two variations of ‚ÄúCorvettes‚Äù - PC 8010 and PC 8020 - went to schools. They did not differ much in appearance, except that 8010 was a ‚Äúworkstation‚Äù for students - it bore PZUshki with a BASIC interpreter, and, in most cases, a compiler Lispa, and on the teaching machines the range of software was already more.  The machines could be connected to the network in the amount of up to 16 pieces via the serial port, and I do not even want to imagine how it looked. <br><br>  A machine that used to be on the balance sheet at my school came into my hands - I have no idea how I got it, because I reliably remember that I didn‚Äôt carry anything like that home.  Perhaps you need to thank my brother, who studied at the same school.  The specific instance of the Corvette, which I demonstrate here, is in a rather deplorable state (the body is broken, and only the keyboard unit is present, that is, the upper part; there are several keys on the keyboard itself (space, one functional), and one is damaged, the motherboard is soldered-rewired, there are a lot of jumpers on the back side, with which someone on the hell replaced a bunch of missing valves, one of the ROM chips may be damaged), however, I hope that even with this condition of the case I I can make it.  But more on that later, but for now some photos: <br><br><img alt="BIS KR580VB51" src="http://img717.imageshack.us/img717/6001/bis.jpg"><br>  BIS serial interface 58051;  The picture shows grass on the PCB with the date of its release: June 6, 1988, i.e.  The board has been wandering for about a year before assembling a finished machine. <br><br><img alt="58055, programmable peripheral interface" src="http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/725/perifg.jpg"><br>  KR580VV55A, full clone of Intel 8255A, programmable interface for peripherals <br><br><img alt="Ram" src="http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/9315/ozu.jpg"><br>  ram blocks <br><br><img alt="M2764AFI, ROM blocks" src="http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/3981/pzuj.jpg"><br>  M2764AFI, ROM blocks.  Cleaning - by UV treatment <br><br><img src="http://img716.imageshack.us/img716/227/lpt.jpg"><br>  The parallel port and the already mentioned KR580VV55A serving it <br><br><img src="http://img26.imageshack.us/img26/9058/plugsw.jpg"><br>  The connectors on the rear panel - video outputs and serial port for connection to the local network <br><br><img src="http://img144.imageshack.us/img144/4835/titleb.jpg"><br>  General view of keyboards <br><br><img src="http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1589/diga.jpg"><br>  Numeric keypad <br><br>  Unfortunately, that's all for now.  I smoke mana, collect BP for this miracle, and gradually restore the PCB.  As soon as I start it, I‚Äôll burn it completely - I‚Äôll definitely inform about this wine or file of the habrasoobshchestvu.  I would be extremely grateful if someone from Tver's native helps with the search for the original case in a sane state and the missing buttons on the keyboard.  Domo arigato and stay tuned. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86589/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86589/</a></p>
