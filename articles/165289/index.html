  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The course of the young soldier "Sell services web designer." Part 2 "The client is always wrong"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  No, this is not just another marketing product.  This is part of the approach to working with clients, the result of which is WinWin cooperation. <br>  I think there will be those who disagree with this statement, and those who agree, finding a cry from the heart in this, but in my case this is just a cold calculation and nothing more.  To accept or not to accept is your business, for me personally this approach in work has been feeding for more than one year.  So, what is the salt of the approach and what are the advantages of this? <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before answering these questions, let's imagine the ideal customer.  What skills and knowledge does he need to have in order to accurately formulate the TK on the site?  Here are a few that came to me in the head: <br><ul><li>  Possession of the current situation on the trends in Internet marketing </li><li>  The ability to sell online </li><li>  Understanding usability and quality layout </li><li>  Technical site restrictions </li><li>  Search engine optimization </li><li>  The ability to clearly explain what he wants, attention to detail. </li></ul><br>  Perhaps you have met such customers, but in my practice, at least with a couple of such skills, I have not met. <br>  What happens: the task is put by a person whose knowledge in this topic tends to zero? <br>  What do we get when, on the one hand, the customer is like a "monkey and glasses" and, on the other hand, an helpful sales person looking into the customer's mouth and taking a detailed note of his Wishlist? <br>  I think those who were in the situation know what will happen: the customer (most often) gets what he ordered (well, or something similar to what he ordered).  And trying to "repel nested."  The result is predictable: disappointment and the site started to flow. <br>  In a small plus, only the developers: one more work is added to the portfolio, the money is received and there is a prospect that the customer, having tasted all the delights of Internet marketing, will grow wiser and will later order the completion of his creation.  Why in the "small plus"?  Because the client most likely will not give his recommendations, and the point is not even in the developer of the site, but in the fact that the person put himself on the Internet, did not get what he wanted, and he has no sense in recommending to friends / partners (why should others tamper on where he burned ?) <br><br>  <i>Summary of approach: Most often the result will be a short-term Win-Lose cooperation, where both lose: the client does not get what he wants, the performer loses the free recommendations market and is forced to invest in advertising for further development.</i> <br><br>  And how to overcome the situation?  The situation can be defeated by changing the paradigm of the approach to communicating with the client, who after brainwashing with smart sales books, with some kind of fright, became ‚Äúalways right‚Äù. <br>  Personally, at the first meeting, I say 2 phrases that set the client to the correct cooperation: <br>  1. <i>‚ÄúTo begin with, let's define how we work: I stupidly do what you say, or you tell me WHAT you want from the site, and NOT WHAT it should be.‚Äù</i> So far, none of my customers have chosen the first, for them a burden that they relinquish with joy.  For the performer, the burden of implementing ‚Äúirrepressible delusional creative‚Äù is removed. <br>  2. <i>"My client is always wrong, until he proves the opposite</i> . <i>"</i>  Artist special in the Internet marketing, but he is not all-knowing.  He does not know the customers of the customer, the psychology and the nuances of sales in this area.  After this phrase, I begin to simply offer options, and the customer is forced to look critically at all these developments in terms of their specifics.  And yes, it is easier to criticize the customer than to be creative, so the work will move faster :)
