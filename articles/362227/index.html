      - Well, I hope that in 2015, Leopoly will be very successful, and we will have many users for Leopoly and we will be able to make a big step forward in the field of education.  In fact, it is not so easy to make a revolution in education, because there are already established processes and teaching methods, you need to have good teaching materials and be able to contact the right people, but we are on the right track.  So, I hope, in 2015, we will finally be able to see this project as we integrate Leonardo into education.  I really hope and believe that this will happen in 2015.  And that there will be many users who already print and use Leonardo to create their own things for the home. <br><br>  <b>- Can you show us how the system works?</b> <br><br>  - Yes, of course, I have Leonardo here and I put the camera to show you my screen <br>  (this is normal, you see it).  OK, do you see my screen ok?  So, as you can see, Leonardo has 3 main elements.  One of them is a bird, about which we have already spoken.  With it, I can manipulate 3D space. <br>  I have these glasses, and it‚Äôs very interesting that if I move my glasses, the image also moves, that is, we track the position of the glasses as well.  This means that it is not only a 3D illusion or a 3D effect, but that the computer projects the image exactly from the position of my eyes.  So I really see it as a reality, so if I move my head into an object, I really hit my head.  If I tilt my head to the left in relation to the object, I will really see the left side of the object.  This is a truly realistic experience.  Similarly, we have a three-dimensional platform, in fact this application is one of the applications that we have made for Leonardo and what I am going to show now is software for 3D modeling. <br>  And let's say, for example, we have a sphere, I can just take this sphere and 3D-simulate on a sphere, and since I use a bird, and not just a mouse, I can immediately change the surface of the object where I want.  I can do 3D objects at an extraordinary speed, for example, let's have this little guy smile, paint his teeth, horns.  I can also portray the nose, and, if I want to add a language, I can put it here ... <br>  Literally within a few seconds, I created a complete 3D object, and it would be impossible to do it in any other way and it is even faster than drawing on a piece of paper.  This is already a full 3D object, you can print it, you can paint it, you can revive it.  You can do with it everything you can do with a 3D object. <br>  So this is an incredible step forward ... <br>  So, for example here, I can duplicate this little guy, let's say we have two copies from the original.  For example, I can add gravity, and they just fall, I can play with them ... Also, for example, I can put a cylinder in virtual space, let's have two or three of them.  Similarly, we can deliver the ball, and in a couple of seconds I can create my own computer game.  And, for example, yes, we have a strike here! <br>  Thus, there are many possibilities, you can make animations, you can make 3D presentations, and many other things.  You can import and export standard file formats.  The program is compatible with all other 3D design applications, that is, if you are working in 3D, you have extreme features. <br><br>  <b>- Daniel, could you tell me that you saw the most interesting things done with your system?</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúHm, in fact, I remember the first time that Leonardo was not developed to this level, we were at SIGGRAPH, and we still didn‚Äôt have a bird, but just an aluminum rod with a LED indicator at the end.  And I remember how one designer approached our booth and designed a terrible monster dog.  I was really shocked, because at that time, even I could not create something so good.  Of course, we later developed an application, and it became much easier with such things, but it was really shocking. <br>  Later, we also started creating very good things.  For example, when we participate in exhibitions together with my colleagues, we together create from 60 to 70 objects a day, per person ... Just like that, we show people what is happening, we do not always make objects, but we play, while showing that here (in the program), how everything was created ... And by the end of the day we create much more objects ... But, probably, the Monster was the most shocking. <br>  Now there are a lot more interesting things created later.  For example, a student from the University of Iowa at CES, where we exhibited together.  I remember going around the hall to see other stands ... As I said, this guy was from the University of Iowa, and the full virtual reality class Leonardo with a lot of Leonardo was installed at the University of Iowa, and they learn how to use it.  His name is Zach, and he works very well with Leonardo, and he can create really interesting things.  I remember this moment at CES, when I ran around the hall, and left our stand for a few minutes ... And when I returned, he created not just one object, but a complete environment with stones and waterfalls and trees and objects of various types. <br>  Since he created this environment very quickly, I simply said ‚ÄúWow.‚Äù  And you can create it all ... <br><br>  <b>- Since you are just starting to enter the Russian market, can you tell me the most important aspects of your system compared to other systems or tools?</b> <br><br>  - Yes, it is very difficult to compare, because virtual reality is a new field. <br>  For example, you probably heard about Oculus Rif, but this is a completely different direction, so while I truly believe that Oculus will make a huge market breakthrough <br>  and it will be very, very cool, this is a virtual reality device where you are completely inside virtual reality, but if you have a situation where you really want to create something and work on something, for example, this type of system (Leonardo) is perfect. <br>  In addition, for example, there are virtual systems the size of a room, they are very expensive <br>  compared to Leonardo.  This is an affordable solution that everyone can have at home, so I think that the main field is for Leonardo, if you have a situation in education, for example, and you need a lot of virtual reality spaces in one class to teach students, then Leonardo is an ideal tool.  If you really want to create, then Leonardo is the best tool.  Or for different types of games, Leonardo is also the best tool. For example, there is a strategy game, where you control your team, and you tell your team what to do, in this case Leonardo will also be the perfect incarnation tool.  So I think this is our main market direction.  But to be honest, there are many types of virtual reality systems.  Also, Leonardo has a great advantage, since it is one of the most affordable systems on the market, since other systems are many times more expensive. </div></div><br><br>  Thank you for being with us. <br>  Especially for 3D printer shop <br><br> <a href="http://www.fabbers.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75d/4b9/896/75d4b98969de4df6ae22e6e89bb150aa.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362227/</a></p>
