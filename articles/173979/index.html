    <blockquote>  All existing ratings, such as tagline, cmsmagazine, ratingruneta, ruward and others, rate everything but the most important - namely, the quality of work of companies that provide creative services in the field of digital.  For the client, the quality of the service should be important, and not, for example, the number of employees or annual turnover (these are also important things, but creativity and production are not technical, but creative businesses, the quality of which is not measured by business indicators). <br><br>  If everything is considered mathematics, then it turns out the company that made 1000 sites is better than the one that made 50 (and it doesn‚Äôt matter that it‚Äôs 1000 sample, narrow-minded solutions, the meaning of which is just to quickly sell what is ‚Äúhawking‚Äù), or, for example, the one makes websites for Gazprom more professional than the one that makes a website for a children's online store, this is a very superficial opinion that has nothing to do with reality. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There is a problem that the client is little formed about the players in the market, and cannot assess the quality due to various reasons, first of all ‚Äúhe didn‚Äôt see the best‚Äù to compare.  Often, he turns to others for advice, including the majority of people "not in the subject, but knowing how everything seems to them."  To do this, we are doing this rating, doing all the work on analyzing and researching the market for the best (and this is a rather high bar, especially for Russia, where there are only a few of several thousand companies that can be called, according to European standards, to be honest ) collect all this and provide it to the client. <br><br>  Places in the rankings are not so much an indicator of the superiority of one company over another, but simply the opinion of experts that someone else does less interesting things, but all market participants are at least quality contractors.  In fact, this is an analogue of any advertising festival where jury, recognized professionals gather, because their experience and talent is celebrated at international and domestic festivals (and we have collected almost all of the most titled) their work is quite famous in the market.  Well, who besides these people who have achieved certain results in their profession (and this cannot be done without taste, talent, experience, and so on) can try to evaluate badly or well?  Right, nobody. <br><br>  The rating certainly cannot be called objectively 100%, but the fact that this is the closest rating to the real situation on the market can be asserted with complete confidence.  Soon we will launch the Promotion category, as well as launch 3 more countries: Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173979/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173979/</a></p>
