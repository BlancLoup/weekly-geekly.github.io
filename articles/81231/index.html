Naturally, this was the main news for serious analysts, both in IT and in economics and politics (just look at how many posts this yesterday was posted on slon.ru), because this is the main news of the era, like any news that starts a new era unconditionally the main.  And Google‚Äôs letter to the Chinese government is the beginning of a new era in all these areas, I would compare this event for the 21st century with the beginning of the 1st World War for the 20th century - the real, and not the calendar, age began.  Someone even called it the 3rd World War.  (About 10 years ago we could have imagined that China would participate in the 3rd World War, but so that a private corporation, and even no interests in the oil business ...))) Mass media as well as mass The blogger almost did not notice this epoch-making event, but despite the fact that the comment was made by serious people, they mostly wrote nonsense. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://markzona.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/kitayanka-bing-vozlozhila-tsveti-na-mogilu-google-2.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And that's what the nonsense was about, all the commentators say that Google is ready to leave the search market in China.  But there is no search market, Google does not trade search, Google sells advertising on the Internet, and with the help of search it controls the Internet.  Search is a virtual shopping arcade for which the user walks, and the merchants themselves are already bustling with trade there, in fact, Google is not a merchant - it is the owner of a bazaar who lives off the rent from merchants in this bazaar.  That's what I say, Google is not so important what place it occupies among the search engines in China, because in the world it ranks first.  Therefore, advertising in the world is placed through it.  That is, if Google leaves the Chinese market, it will lose hundreds of millions of dollars, and in the future, tens of billions of dollars, but China will lose everything, because Chinese businessmen will be cut off from the world market in which they sell their goods using Google‚Äôs advertising.  And then you think its share in the Chinese search is not there, it considers, it‚Äôs necessary to consider Google‚Äôs share in Chinese GDP, more precisely in Chinese exports.  China sells its products through Google, China, thanks to Google, has become a world economic leader.

But the question, of course, remains why Google went into direct confrontation with the Chinese authorities.  That is the question why he agreed to censor the results of his search results in China, because he had to enter the Chinese market, and after he had tamed the clientele to himself, he was able to set conditions for it, as the owner of the well, to a caravan operator in the desert, who its waters will be bent.  But it's not even that Google is so strong in the Chinese market to put forward its demands to the Chinese government, the fact is that throughout the past year Chinese Communists have been attacking Google more and more, Google got the impression that they were trying to get it out of the market.  And this is understandable; technologically, the Chinese search engine is weaker than Google, as all admirers of authoritarian regimes in the world would hate this fact, but freedom is more creative than non-freedom, non-freedom can only copy what freedom comes up with, therefore non-freedom always lags behind freedom competition freedom.  Therefore, you need a ghetto for Google, so as not to control the information field on the Internet.  In fact, Google is also located in China in the ghetto, because its elements are freedom of speech, and they are not allowed to work by profession, so he has to be second among Chinese search engines, because the first - Baidu is allowed to spit on copyrights, and Google is forced to respect American laws, and even respect Chinese copyright, because they are well aware that this may be thrown out of Chinese search under the pretext of copyright infringement, so he gives way to Baidu, which provides itself with its illegal activities. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8f4/bea/913/8f4bea9139dcda93103ab993d234508d.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  But the Chinese Communists miscalculated - it turns out that their teacher Marx was not quite right, stating that money is more important to business than honor.  Google decided not to separate cutlets from flies, he decided that he could not make money by selling advertising to Chinese businessmen in the world, he wanted to make money in the Chinese market, and the only product Google can offer is not for businessmen, but for ordinary Chinese users. freedom of speech.  And he does not give it to sell in China.  Therefore, Google and rebelled.  And he put the Chinese Communists before an unthinkable choice - either the loss of economic leadership or the loss of political monopoly.  Both mean loss of power for them.  It remains for them to decide what will lead to this faster, in order to choose the opposite option.  But in any case, this is a shah, which in any decision means a checkmate for Chinese communists. <br><br>  No matter how the current situation ends (and judging by the fact that Chinese users bring flowers to Google‚Äôs office in China with farewell notes, the Chinese themselves do not believe that the Chinese Communist Party for the sake of China‚Äôs prosperity would agree to abandon the monopoly on power), but it was worth In addition, because it made a revolution in our brains, however, if there are brains ... A heart with a simple inscription ‚ÄúThank you, GOOGLE!‚Äù is the highest rating of activity, such private feelings have not been honored by any private corporation in world history before. <br><br>  However, there is a cynical explanation of this situation, it was a strategic move by the United States, America decided to remove China from world industrial leaders to retake this place, and in return the US government would allow Google to implement its development plan, however, the US has no choice, because that it is thanks to Google that the US remains the world economic leaders, despite the loss of industrial leadership, and in the foreseeable future they will remain ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81231/</a></p>
