Sure, you've been waiting for this post, because every competition is beautiful with results.  It has come, it‚Äôs still the same time - summing up the results of the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/295735/">contest</a> ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for awesome stories‚Äù.  And, I must say, we got some amazing stories on 20 thousand letters - we had something to read in the evening at our leisure.  It's doubly awesome that you approached the creative contest with a share of responsibility, bringing really amazing stories about upgrading computers from the depths of your memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jq/yn/0g/jqyn0gkuabmpfxfcdxbdwi3jc78.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  One of the most pleasant experiences is nostalgia, especially in those happy times when 32 MB of SD-RAM were standard, 3dfx is still alive, and Unreal was scared to shiver at the knees with the first meeting with Skaarj.  It is to these times that most of the stories sent to the competition in different nominations relate.  We are only happy about this, because in the competition works, the interestingness of the situation and qualitative changes were assessed, not the amount of RAM that you acquired. <br><br><h4>  We had three nominations: </h4><br>  1. ‚ÄúSkill pulls, but the hardware decides‚Äù - about replacing the mouse, keyboard or headset. <br>  2. ‚ÄúSay no to spherical horses in vacuum‚Äù - about the experience of turning synthetic ‚Äúparrots‚Äù into real performance. <br>  3. ‚ÄúNeed for Speed‚Äù - about performance gains when upgrading RAM.  Let's look at the results of each of them and determine which creature is worthy of falling into the netlen!

    <h3>  ‚ÄúThe skill is dragging, but the hardware decides‚Äù </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/wv/0l/aswv0lehrr4beqe5tyffpknbwug.gif"><br><br>  Formally, only one competitive work from Leeloush_Keer could be attributed to this category, in which he shared the sensations of the new HyperX Alloy FPS keyboard.  The sysadmin NoOne has attributed its history of bureaucratic twists and turns when updating a prehistoric server in the same category, but it just so happened that ‚ÄúSkill ...‚Äù is about gaming peripherals. <br><br>  NoOne, your <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/295735/">cool story is</a> really cool and very vital, because 512 MB for a server is not a memory, but sclerosis.  But 512 MB of RAM is not a mouse, keyboard or headset.  Therefore, we sent your story for evaluation in another nomination. <br>  And the winner is <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/leeloush_keer/" class="user_link">Leeloush_Keer,</a> with full drama, a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/295735/">review</a> of the change of the old wiped keyboard on HyperX Alloy FPS. <br><br><blockquote>  So, ladies and gentlemen, no preludes and chewing snot.  Immediately proceed to the apodosis. <br>  The essence is as simple as three kopecks, lying in a broken pocket - by occupation, I need to type very long texts.  Not just long, but straight, very long, straight "Multiobuch". <br><br>  And now my old keyboard, which has seen the second diablo no longer suits me - it seems to be typing, but it's not that.  As if something was missing, the buttons of the mother-of-pearl toli, the toli of sensations were not the same, and she dabbled, she dug through a couple of keys, it does not happen to anyone).  And by the will of fate, and maybe even evil rock - I ran into an article, but here, from the same author, it was a post about the HyperX Alloy FPS Black USB sale.  And here in my head clicked - "and why not?".  But I really wanted ELITE.  I wrote to the author personally, saying so and so, when is ELITE waiting in our city?  In response, the raven on the tail brought the news, they say the keyboard can be purchased at the upcoming Igromir.  A few days have passed, and now I am standing at the HyperX stand, asking about why there are no ELITE blue switches.  In general, how long is short, but I bought it HyperX Alloy FPS Black USB ... and we became as one, like Steve and Nancy, like Batman and Robin, like Ash and Pikachu.  This keyboard is for me the same as for an old pirate sea-stick arm of a stylet, which he soldered a dozen times with hot blood.  Like the endless, pristine and neglected snow-covered forests of Norway, which were never trod on by humanity for the scarred old wolf.  Like ... well, enough water.  The keyboard is really very responsive.  I want to print on it, I want to look at it, I want to boast about it. <br><br>  The keyboard became for my occupation a second breath.  I feel every click of it, I hear every click of it, I am, that very EVERY click. <br></blockquote><br>  Congratulations, bro, the rules are the rules, and you strictly followed them.  Contact us through private messages to clarify the coordinates.  Even more cool keyboard <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeekElite">HyperX Alloy Elite is</a> sent to you. <br><br><h3>  ‚ÄúSay no to spherical horses in vacuum‚Äù </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ar/ux/5m/arux5mu0nv4w5qfqsto388a7yfu.jpeg"><br>  Perhaps it was the most difficult, but the most interesting nomination for us.  In it, you had to describe your experience in evaluating actual performance, contrary to synthetic benchmarks.  Who cares about the beautiful "parrots", if the real increase during the upgrade was a few percent?  We are sure that the winner will appreciate a pair of <a href="https://goo.gl/4aAnWa">Kingston KVR DDR4 2133 MHz</a> modules of <a href="https://goo.gl/4aAnWa">8 GB</a> in full, because installing them in any computer can give it a second life. <br><br>  And here our opinions were divided, it was very difficult to choose a winner.  In one corner of the ring with real experience, user Varfalomey, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/295735/">who experienced the sadness</a> of comparing a conventional SSD with SATA interface and a monster on NVME.  The moral of the story is simple - at some point the real difference in performance without virtual lines is no longer noticeable. <br><br>  In another corner, a swordman-sib with a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/295735/">monumental</a> SSD testing <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/295735/">methodology</a> , backed by a theoretical base.  We fully agree with the author - more real types of load under the most difficult conditions! <br><br>  According to the results of fierce disputes with the use of non-life-threatening verbal non-violence, we determined the winner.  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/swordman-sib/" class="user_link">Swordman-sib</a> , you will get an excellent SSD reviewer!  We are waiting for your reviews.  And 2 Kingston KVR DDR4 2133 MHz modules of 8 GB each are waiting for you.  Write to us in the LAN your coordinates to get a prize. <br><br>  Here is the most useful winning commentary: <br><br><blockquote>  Speaking about testing methods, we usually mean well-known synthetic tests - it is their ‚Äúmagic‚Äù numbers that in many cases become decisive when choosing a particular model as another username or argument in favor of this very choice by one or another veteran of sofa troops in the corresponding Internet commentaries. resource <br><br>  However, in reality, a program for synthetic testing of any of the assembly components on a user PC is just as fantastic as the extreme figures of a spherical sample in a vacuum carried by the marketing expert‚Äôs hand on the packaging of the entire batch.  In everyday work, the average temperature in hospitals is the load of the storage device dependent on many factors, and it is not possible to reliably calculate it for each system;  but test scripts common to most users are completely. <br><br>  So what is the difference between laboratory and user-oriented testing? <br><br>  First, on a client PC, a solid record never produces a perfectly uniform recording of the infamous 4 KB blocks for an extended period of time.  And it would be more logical to measure the performance (more precisely, the schedule of its stability) not by the first, but by subsequent passes of the test - we are interested in the speed of arbitrary operations in the worst scenario.  Including when copying files multiple times (preferably mixed type).  Wait for TRIM cleaning, repeat. <br><br>  Secondly, in addition to the well-proven, but still synthetic PCMark, it will be useful to evaluate the launch speed of real applications that form the routine user environment.  This, for example, the speed of archiving and unzipping a mixed set of files, the opening of "heavy" documents by the MS Office package, and a similar operation with projects in Photoshop and Premiere Pro.  Do not forget about the games, for the sake of speeding up the loading and speed of which, not least of all, solid-state drives are purchased: we run several demanding modern projects and compare the real speed. <br><br>  And finally, by far not all reviews can see such an important indicator as the temperature mode of the drive under continuous load - and meanwhile, for owners of compact cases and especially laptops, this is one of the most important indicators of the dynamics of SSD performance and service life. <br><br>  Of course, you shouldn‚Äôt completely cancel synthetics - a common guideline for all models is an important component in testing.  But to expand the quantity and quality of indicators, turning to the user in a language understandable to him, definitely does not hurt. <br></blockquote><br><h3>  "Need for Speed" </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hq/zx/ux/hqzxuxrq_m83snm05ymljmepino.jpeg"><br><br>  Vrummmm-vrummmm, - howl a computer cooler, unable to absorb the highest load.  The processor is puffing, the hard disk is cracking, unloading data into a swap, the RAM, which is so much in short supply, is heated.  But everything changes when new RAM modules appear. <br><br>  All your stories written for this nomination are full of tragedy.  For each of them, you can make a film that breaks into a tear no worse than Titanic.  Everyone passed through the regrettable statement of a lack of RAM, and each story has a good ending. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNeed for speed‚Äù turned out to be the most popular nomination, you sent especially many stories, to choose among which the best was oh, how difficult!  All of them deserve to be read, each of them has its own zest - thanks to the authors for a detailed and emotional description. <br><br>  Hardest of all, the lack of RAM is noticeable on the servers - sometimes even half a gigabyte can radically change the situation.  There were several server histories, for example, a short but <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/295735/">fascinating story</a> from varfalomey about a remote workstation of almost military level (correct us in the comments).  Train yourself in the skill of the writer, your baggage of experience with proper description will turn into amazing stories! <br><br>  However, even more exciting was the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/295735/">thriller</a> from <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/bubavv/" class="user_link">BubaVV</a> , which with the help of shamanism, the saliva of the unicorn, the rabbit's foot and the flashing of the SPD chip on the RAM made the upgrade to the old MacBook.  Your comment shocked us with an overwhelming level of enthusiasm, courage, and straightforward hands, even though the first time you screwed up the module.  ;) Hopefully, with the <a href="https://goo.gl/XZXZzZ">HyperX Fury DDR4-2400</a> memory <a href="https://goo.gl/XZXZzZ">kit</a> of two modules of 8 GB, you will never need to reflash to a lower frequency.  Write us in a personal your coordinates, the prize is already waiting! <br><br><blockquote> The first story is about 2002. After the upgrade of the company, the old Pentium-120 remained with 16 MB of memory.  As I remember, EDO SIMM.  On it somehow crawled Vin98.  By the way, the collectors in the store stole (?) Paid for and available in the TAGRAM check, but nobody remembers anything like that now.  Once I came to visit a friend who worked as an administrator-laboratory assistant at a university, and drew attention to the closet with all sorts of written off junk.  His eyes lit up, he received the admission and fished out 2 bars of the necessary memory of 16 MB each.  As a result, it turned out to pull on the computer ASP Linux 7.1 and start to learn the basics of working with networks and all that.  When I played enough, I put NT4 and Opera 9.tototam and dragged the computer to the dacha, where he finalized it before the screw died. <br><br>  The second is generally fresh, the checks in case of return have not yet had time to rot.  I got decommissioned MacBook, in which only 2 GB of memory.  Using this with the current version of the OS can not be in any way, but you can upgrade to 8GB + SSD, and this is quite decent.  Memory there DDR3-1066, two channels.  Levels of different sizes are supported, but at least one must be at 1066 MHz, and the second is not slower than this speed.  And 4GB-1066 is exotic at wild prices and / or long delivery.  But, as it turned out, you can buy faster modules and change the SPD at 1066 frequency in one of them. The program for the firmware is very specific and not cheap, but we managed to find some old version with keygen, which runs only on Win7 and the clock installed in March 2011 of the year.  Chipset like laptop supported.  So Butkamp, ‚Äã‚Äãin his Seven, in the Seven broach, in the laptop slats 1 + 4.  I configure the speed of the 4-gig module, press the ‚ÄúFlash‚Äù button, and I sew the wrong module - the 1GB bar sticks up.  I realize this after shutdown.  I repeat everything with the last bar at the right speed, but for some reason, Butcamp collapses along the way.  I rearrange everything in a new way, well, that from the image.  This time I'm flashing what I need.  In the end, everything flies, and the laptop from the trash goes into the category of workers.  The intensity of emotions in the process recalled the famous episode of "Flight of the Phoenix." </blockquote><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IACjOvyx5hs" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3>  To all participants </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8q/r7/mf/8qr7mfwbqfzmxtzkuo-rlbxypyg.jpeg"><br><br>  Thank you so much for your stories, each of them is valuable in its own way and was interesting to us.
