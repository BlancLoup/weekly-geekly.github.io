But I will tell you about my history, I think someone will be useful and interesting. <br><br>  A year ago, I was skeptical about any coupon sites: I was not interested in what was offered to them in the service sector at all, and it was easier to order any goods from Ebay or from some European online store.  Well, or buy a store to go.  Especially since I have already heard / read stories a couple of times (including in the Habr√©), that even on Groupon (which is one of the largest sites) the Chinese stuff is being ‚Äúpulled‚Äù ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/126112/">http://habrahabr.ru/post/126112/</a> or <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/130440/">http://habrahabr.ru/post/130440/</a> ).  In fairness, the organizer of the sale is completely different companies that have no relation to the service itself.  I thought that somehow the situation would be corrected after that, companies that provide their services will begin to check.  But as it turned out, no.  Do not check.

      Why is this post in the "I resent" hub?  Yes, because, as will be described later, infuriates the attitude of various companies towards their customers.  And about fraud. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, let's begin. <br><br><h4>  Start </h4><br>  In December 2011, he was to move to a new apartment.  Naturally, the question arose about the repair, purchase of furniture, etc., etc.  First they decided to furnish and repair the kitchen, since there was nothing standing there besides the stove.  Well, the train shops, salons, approximately looked at how much the kitchen set will cost.  But about the repair did not recognize anything.  And then one fine day (December 13, 2011, to be exact), browsing various companies on the Internet, I stumble upon Groupon‚Äôs action together with World of Kitchens - <a href="http://groupon.ru/piter/mirkuhon">http://groupon.ru/piter/mirkuhon</a> .  In short, what they offer: a discount on the kitchen of about 45,000 rubles, free repairs in the room, a design layout, production time is 1.5 months.  Well, seemingly nothing.  Moreover, the comments indicated that the client buys the materials himself.  They decided to buy, after all, Groupon, a company that seems to be known. <br><br>  But about the "World of Kitchens", which provides services, there was nothing on the Internet - just a shitty <a href="http://mir-kuhon.ru/">site</a> , and an old forum.  Knowing the specifics of Russian business, which do not particularly bother about their representation on the Internet, I decided not to pay attention to it. <br><br>  12/14/2011 paid a coupon, call the "World of Kitchens" to set a time when you can come to draw up a design and contract.  Designated for January 11th!  Well, damn, it is clear that the holidays, the more we go on vacation on December 23, so that figs with him, we will wait.  And now, we come from vacation ... <br><br><h4>  Preparation of contract </h4><br>  ... and arrive at the appointed time in the sales office of "World of Kitchens".  Along the way, they didn‚Äôt even know about us there, the girl-designer had only recently begun to work, she was not warned.  Hour 2 was a model, as a result, the cost of the kitchen came out at about 120,000 rubles (I don‚Äôt have a receipt on hand now, so I don‚Äôt remember), minus a discount, for a total of about 80,000. Well, the repair will be free!  The contract specifies the time of manufacture of the kitchen 90 working days + 30 days may be delays at the factory.  We ask why so long, in the action, after all, it is stated that 45 days is a production time.  To which the girl replied that it was ‚Äújust a formality, they do, in fact, for a maximum of 2 months‚Äù.  Okay, fine.  Some little things in the contract were still, but, honestly, I didn‚Äôt read it very carefully (I was already tired of sitting for more than 2 hours), we sign the contract, we pay and we go home happy.  The measurer should arrive within 10 days.  She cannot say anything about free repair, as she recently came, she will have to discuss it with the measurer. <br><br>  Having come home, I reread the contract on a fresh mind.  Although I am not a lawyer, it is clear that he was wrong: <br><br><ol><li>  Warranty starts from the date of signing the contract of sale (that is, 2 months earlier) </li><li>  If I terminate the contract, then I pay a penalty + they return the money when they sell my order </li><li>  If they do not meet the deadline, then they pay a penalty of 0.1% for each day, but not more than 5% </li><li>  Construction materials need to be purchased from a subcontractor. </li></ol><br><br>  In general, drawn up in favor of the company, not the buyer. <br>  The measurer came to us only on February 4, and was due on January 21.  Since January 21, every day they called this ‚ÄúWorld of Kitchens‚Äù, every day they left a request, and each time they had to call back during the day. <br>  This situation zadolbala, I am writing a letter to Groupon.  The next day comes the answer that they will find out about it.  And - oh, a miracle!  The next day the measurer calls, says he will arrive in 3-4 days.  Well, let's wait, so we have been waiting for 20 days, and there are only 4 of them. <br><br>  I came, measured, found out what we would do to repair, wrote everything down.  It turned out that the layout was incorrectly compiled; one cabinet should be removed.  I call in the "World of Kitchens", so they say, and so, you need to redo the layout.  They say come in a week.  And what kind of "non-standard" may need to pay extra.  Then I almost bent them, but somehow I restrained myself, he said that they had to return the money to me, as they had done less, less materials, less fittings, a kitchen, and so was tailor-made - so return the excess.  Ok, agreed ... <br><br>  I come to the office at a specified time, another girl is already working there, my model was not found, everything must be done anew.  Ok, counted, should return about 8000 rubles.  And here I am amazed at some people, it is necessary to deceive - and that‚Äôs all!  The fact is that assembling a kitchen costs 12% of the cost of a headset.  The cost of the headset has become less, but the assembly remains the same.  I point this out to the consultant, ‚Äúoh, sorry, I forgot‚Äù (yeah, I‚Äôm sitting next to me and I don‚Äôt see how you forgot), corrects, everything seems to be fine.  He says that about the repair will come within a week. <br><br><h4>  Provision of services </h4><br>  I‚Äôm waiting for a foreman for a repair estimate, I‚Äôm writing to Groupon a couple of times and calling the office daily.  There are no answers from Groupon, except the standard ‚ÄúYour application is being reviewed, we will call you‚Äù. <br><br>  At this time (after 2 months of the beginning of the action) reviews begin to appear.  And all the bad. <br><br>  A foreman comes, asks what we will repair, says that he will throw an estimate in the evening (it was on the eve of March 8).  The estimate was sent only in a week.  Seeing her, I put it mildly, ofigel.  Building materials (rough) for 25,000 - 30,000, I go to the first online store in St. Petersburg, add the same materials to the basket - less than 7,000. I also give more, call the foreman, he: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know anything, I have such a price have given.  I call in "World of Kitchens", also to no purpose, refer to the contract, I refer to Groupon, and indeed, according to the terms of the promotion, I should have the kitchen.  I am writing, I am calling to Groupon, about a week later I received a reply from them with the following meaning: ‚ÄúWhat is stated in the terms of the action is garbage, the main thing is the contract‚Äù.  On the Internet there are already quite a lot of complaints about this action, Groupon could not not know.  And after some time, the action again appeared on this site, as well as on several smaller sites.  Some are suing, some are waiting, including me. <br><br>  I spat on this repair from their side, which they (‚ÄúWorld of Kitchens‚Äù), even when paying for materials, either do not do it or do it terribly.  And all this was still in the middle of March. <br><br><h4>  What now </h4><br>  And nothing.  A couple of clients received their kitchens (though they ordered them back in November, and the quality is terrible), REN-TV took the story about this company (but without mentioning the name), one person won the trial.  There are still a lot of customers waiting.  Groupon, according to their correspondence answers, will not / will not do anything, since the terms of the action mean nothing, the main contract concluded with the company. <br><br>  Some will say: "Another nagging, zadolbali already!".  Well, let. <br><br>  Personally, I am not upset by the fact that I got caught by a scam (or what is it called?), But by the fact that a fairly serious company, Groupon, treats its users like this.  It is clear that the main goal of any commercial organization is profit.  But, damn it, not in the same way!  Well, when the first time did not check the data of the company that will provide the service.  Well, the second time.  But third, when there are already so many negative reviews about the World of Kitchens on the Internet - why ?!  Why provide their services to a company that Rospotrebnadzor fined twice?  Why do a second time to do a share on which the customer of FIG get the service?  I do not understand... <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  So, why won't I use coupons: <br><br><ul><li>  There is no guarantee that the service will be provided (as it is possible to register a one-day company, rivet shares on a hundred sites with coupons, and dump) </li><li>  There are no guarantees that the service will be of good quality (see the previous paragraph) </li><li>  After the "activation" of the coupon, all the problems are the problems between you and the seller.  But not the service on which the action was placed, and to the account of which funds were received from the buyer </li></ul><br><br>  Yes, these are obvious things (for some), but when you hear the name of a company known to the whole world, you forget, and you start thinking: ‚ÄúOh, a serious, international firm will not deceive, they will stand up for customers.‚Äù  But in reality ... However, everyone will draw conclusions himself, perhaps - it‚Äôs just that I was so unlucky. <br><br>  <strong>PS:</strong> All comments on spelling / ochepyatkam write in a personal, please.  If someone is interested in the price, the text of the contract, etc. - I will try to lay out tonight.  I wonder whether it is possible to terminate such a contract of sale, for which the company has already been fined, and that all funds paid back? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144715/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144715/</a></p>
