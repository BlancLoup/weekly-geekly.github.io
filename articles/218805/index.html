  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Radio telescope</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We used to see the world in the optical range and hear in the sound.  Everyone knows that a bat sees in the dark thanks to an ultrasonic locator.  There are many devices that expand the human capabilities of perception - this includes all measuring equipment.  It displays all sorts of physical processes in a graphic or sound form, accessible to a person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2dd/425/fa5/2dd425fa526226e1c099174c374db42e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Technical description </h4><br>  This setup is a two-coordinate scanning device.  It operates in the 10GHz range, and at these frequencies TV satellites operate.  Originally planned to make a photograph of the geostationary orbit.  In addition to this, it was interesting to look at the Sun, and also, from the category of children's curiosity, I wanted to know whether the Moon would be visible and, in general, what would be in the picture. <br><br>  The device uses a parabolic mesh antenna, a converter for the 10-12 GHz range, a two-axis rotary device, with a specially designed control panel, a program for controlling the rotary device is written.  In order to digitize the level, a board is assembled from a log-level converter AD8313, ADC MAX1236, a controller transmitting information to the COM port.  The program that controls the PTZ device receives data from the ADC, adds temporary and coordinate labels to them and saves them to a file.  The image is based on a simple but necessary algorithm, since  the accuracy of the coordinates is 1 degree, and the data goes at a speed of 10 counts per degree.  Since  in our case, the plate rotates horizontally, then horizontally the resolution is about 10 points per degree, and vertically 1 point per degree.  A full panoramic picture with a 360-degree wide view and 90-degree high is about an hour and a half.  Thanks to the converter's capabilities, it is possible to receive radiation with different polarization separately and to receive various images.  Such black-and-white images can be compiled in one color, thanks to which the satellites look multicolored.  Few people realize this, but a parabolic system with a head in focus of a parabola has the ability to focus not only on satellites, but also try to focus on, for example, the neighboring house, thanks to which you can get clear pictures of the greenhouse frame and even the window frame that the diameter of a parabolic reflector is much larger than their width.

When we received a positive result, we took a wide shot and saw the trees.  They were very blurred and an aura was visible around them at some distance.  Later, with the adjustment and additional processing in Photoshop and the comprehension of the projection, it became clear and clear that the aura of the trees is the wires of the power lines. <br><br><img width="600" height="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b8/ff1/7e6/1b8ff17e69295e16025b54908bc9a40b.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Moon </h5><br>  Everyone knows that not only the Moon rotates around the Earth, but also a brighter object - the Sun, which can be seen by looking at this animation, in which both luminaries are visible. <br><br><img width="600" height="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c5/1a6/50b/2c51a650bc73829a059ca0bb22538a92.gif"><br><br><h5>  Northern Lights </h5><br>  All those who tried to watch satellite TV in rain or snow, when there is only one continuous dark cloud in the sky, know that the quality of the received signal depends on the weather conditions.  In this case, it is obvious that the radio signal from the satellite is extinguished in clouds.  But there are other factors that influence reception quality, for example, radiation from the sun.  We have noticed that often after a while after strong solar flares, the picture from meteorological satellites is received with very strong noises - this works the ionosphere, creating noise. <br><br>  We took pictures during the sunny weather.  Naro-Fominsk.  The effect occurred after sunset. <br><br><img width="600" height="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31f/1c7/c57/31f1c7c57a578c300901ef030db51f46.gif"><br><br>  The animation shows a moving sun. <br><br><h5>  Outbreaks on the ground </h5><br>  Once during a periodic shoot, long powerful flashes were observed, occupying most of the sky.  It is difficult to get a real instant image if one shot is taken within 8 minutes, but you can look at the animation made as it was possible. <br><br><img width="600" height="150" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d82/102/27e/d8210227e3d81f930917e78bb3161abb.gif"><br><br>  If you have something to say about flares or just have something to add to this topic, please write in the comments. <br><br>  All images can be viewed here: <a href="http://meteosputnik.ru/radiotelescope">meteosputnik.ru/radiotelescope</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218805/</a></p>
