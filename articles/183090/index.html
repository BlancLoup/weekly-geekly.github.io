This was reported by an informed source, who wished to remain anonymous. <br><br>  The capital office of the company is located near the station.  m. "Left Bank" on the street.  M. Raskova, 11-A.  According to the source, electronic data carriers (servers) of the company were seized. <br><br>  In addition, searches were carried out in the housing of several top managers of the company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The press service of WebMoney.UA initially denied any actions by the tax authorities in the company's office in the afternoon of June 11.  One of the security officers of the office center in which the company rents the premises confirmed the information about the visit of the tax authorities to the correspondent of LIGABusinessInform, who arrived at the scene.  The interlocutor, in particular, noted: "I have never seen anything like this, there was a whole company of them."  According to him, the visitors showed ‚Äútax ID certificates‚Äù.

      It is worth recalling that the company WebMoney.UA has a long-standing unofficial conflict with the NBU.  Since 2009, the regulator has refused to agree on the rules for the operation of this online payment system in Ukraine.  In October 2012, the Parliament adopted a law tightening control over the operation of ‚Äúelectronic money‚Äù systems.  From now on, only banks can emit them. <br><br>  Earlier, in a comment for LIGABusinessInform, the NBU press service reported that the rules of WebMoney in Ukraine are not agreed by the National Bank in accordance with the requirements established by the legislation of Ukraine regarding the activities of payment systems, operators of payment infrastructure services or electronic money transactions.  Therefore, they say, the activities of WebMoney in Ukraine is illegal.  The NBU has repeatedly recommended banks and other legal entities to take measures to terminate the provision of services using WebMoney. <br><br>  The company WebMoney.UA claims that the National Bank deliberately delays approval of the rules of the system in the interests of individual market participants. <br><br>  On the afternoon of June 12, Margarita Ormotsadze, head of WebMoney PR department, confirmed the fact of the tax audit at the company.  The inspection was carried out by representatives of the tax police.  According to her, the inspectors seized the ‚Äútest computer equipment‚Äù.  She did not confirm and did not disprove the fact that a housing search was conducted for the top managers of WebMoney.UA.  At the moment, lawyers are investigating the legality and legitimacy of tax actions. <br><br>  The press service of the Main Directorate of the Ministry of Incomes and Fees in Kiev didn‚Äôt refute LigaBusinessInform‚Äôs correspondent with information about an inspection at the WebMoney office in Kiev, stating that employees of the Kiev central board did not participate in this. </blockquote><br>  Original article: <a href="http://finance.liga.net/personal/2013/6/12/news/34426.htm">finance.liga.net/personal/2013/6/12/news/34426.htm</a> <br><br>  From myself I will add that on the 11th early in the morning I sent 1400 hryvnias to withdraw funds.  Until now, they are in the ‚ÄúAccount Paid‚Äù state, although usually in such cases, after lunch, the money is already sent to the bank. <br><br>  Last night I wanted to withdraw funds, but I encountered an error: <br><blockquote>  Output by this method is temporarily unavailable for technical reasons. </blockquote><br>  The method was listed as ‚ÄúCard of another bank‚Äù =&gt; ‚ÄúBank Aval‚Äù. <br><br>  I hope that this is only a temporary phenomenon.  The frozen money will return to the account (or will be sent to the bank), and WebMoney will continue its stable operation.  I believe that WebMoney is one of the main payment systems for the financial operations of most freelancers and "free IT artists", so I published this news here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183090/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183090/</a></p>
