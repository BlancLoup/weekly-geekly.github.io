They are taught how to do it, and the rest is unimportant. ‚Äù  ‚ÄúThey do not delve into the process of creating a product, they are not interested in its quality.  Any sales assistant is better than a marketer. "  Such phrases can often be heard from the developers of sites promoting a particular product or product.

      <b>Understand the consumer</b> <br><br>  What do marketers respond to such claims?  "Every product has its own consumer."  And indeed it is.  This is the first thing that is told in any good university.  Before the marketer and not the task to improve the product, he must figure out how to sell the existing one.  That is why marketers are pressing on site developers, demanding - who would have thought?  - information.  Information about who enters, for example, on a particular page, who has already bought the product, where the buyer comes from, and so on.  The marketer studies the market in order to understand which consumer to offer the existing product in order to sell more efficiently.  We can say that the marketer distracts the developer from creating a platform for selling a product in order to understand how this product is best sold.  Paradox! <br><br>  <b>Statistics vs emotions</b> <br><br>  A modern marketer deals not so much with emotions as with numbers.  That is why he needs statistics on the attendance of sites, sections, pages of a product.  In parallel, the sales specialist should take into account the emotions, they can not be discounted.  Any sales process is fraught with emotion, and there are always people behind any transaction.  Some produce and sell goods, others need this product and want to buy it.  That is why a modern marketing specialist is a person who not only knows and loves to sell, but also seeks to understand his buyer.  What does he want?  Why does he buy this or that product?  How to choose? <br> <a href="http://universarium.org/course/504"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fe/0e9/bb4/1fe0e9bb418d441788bc99b4769a3dd3.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>Why change the font on the product page</b> <br><br>  It is with such strange requests that marketers constantly turn to online content developers.  They try, make a user-friendly, logical interface, but a sales specialist comes in and requires for some reason to swap sections, make headings of a different color or other size, and so on.  Developers are angry and do not like marketers even more, which affects the overall result of their work. <br>  Meanwhile, for sales professionals it is not just a whim.  Making their suggestions, they take into account the psychology of the average consumer.  Different factors influence the client‚Äôs decision to purchase the product: psychological, social, situational.  Among the psychological factors, in addition to the motivation to purchase one or another product, which each client has his own, there are also features of perception.  Yes, marketers are not gods and cannot influence the values, beliefs, attitudes and lifestyle of a customer.  But they can affect the size or color of the font on the site!  If, of course, developers descend to listening to them.  And the font size, in turn, will affect the choice of the consumer. <br><br> <a href="http://universarium.org/course/504"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c61/07b/085/c6107b085dad4fc887d7c1781f2067c2.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>Environmental influence</b> <br><br>  Another group of factors influencing whether a person buys a product or not, whether it visits the site or passes by is social variables.  The environment (family, opinion of significant people, cultural context) is of great importance when choosing a product.  That is why marketers are asked to install on the site page "extra" elements that spoil the design - buttons repost in social networks, for example.  This also includes forums, chat rooms, forms for quick recall, ‚ÄúBring a friend‚Äù campaign, various mailings and other ‚Äúchips‚Äù that cause a headache for the developer.  People like to share with each other opinions about the product, people like to communicate - and this increases sales. <br><br>  <b>Time, place, circumstances</b> <br><br>  The third group of factors influencing consumer choice is situational variables: time, place of purchase, appearance of goods and the environment of a person at the time of making a purchase decision.  It is with these factors that marketers most often work, here a professional field is provided with a huge field of activity.  Developers blame marketers that they are fixated on packaging and generally on the "external" properties of the product to the detriment of the "internal", do not pay enough attention to the product quality descriptions. <br>  But the latter have an excuse: they know how strongly the consumer is, in fact, focused on these very external properties.  Often, the decision to buy or not to buy goods is made only on the basis of how it looks or how it is packed!  If the client likes the site and the service, he will close his eyes even on some of the product‚Äôs flaws.  This does not mean that now you can not think about the quality of the product, it just means that the marketer did a good job. <br><br> <a href="http://universarium.org/course/504"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f1/63a/aed/2f163aaed7494c8e853bf760a9e6586e.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>Find out more</b> <br><br>  Is there a way to reconcile developers with marketers?  Of course.  For this, both those and others need to realize that by and large they have one goal - to help the consumer find their product.  Only they approach it from different sides.  As if two blind men, feeling the elephant from different sides, they describe either the trunk or the leg, and they are surprised that the descriptions do not coincide. <br><br>  And how can a developer understand a marketer?  Open your eyes and get around the "elephant" from all sides!  In other words, learn about consumer behavior that marketing professionals know.  And then there will be no questions left, why and why are these strange people demanding to make certain changes on the site, in the product description, and so on.  Right now at the "Universarium" there is a free course <a href="http://universarium.org/course/504">"Marketing - a quick start,"</a> in which a lot of attention is paid just to analyzing consumer behavior. <br><br>  Marketers are ready for dialogue!  Developers left to take a step forward. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302026/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302026/</a></p>
