About some approaches to sales, we know for sure, about some we can only guess.  We are trying to learn something from them, but we cannot learn something. <br><br>  For example, in addition to the standard diagnostic groups like General Analysis, 64-bit analysis or Optimization, we have a group in PVS-Studio called Customer's Specific.  There are diagnostics that are needed by our customers, but which are not suitable for other diagnostic groups.  To put it more artistically, you can say so.  The Customer's Specific Diagnostics Group is the erogenous zone of our product.  If you touch it (add some diagnostics there), then the client will be very pleased.  Naturally, such an approach to product development and sales should be applied very carefully, since the end customer does not have a full vision of the product and has no idea where the product is developing. <br><br>  We also like how the pre-sale team at <a href="http://www.coverity.com/">Coverity</a> works.  We are certainly not 100% sure of this, but it seems to us that they work something like this.  If a potential client appears, the special forces will fly to it by helicopter, which on-site sets up the environment, starts the analyzer, carefully works with the list of diagnostic messages, etc.  At the end of all this, a PRESENTATION (!) Is made for a potential client, in which the client is told about the errors found in his project and they say what to do to avoid them (buy a tool, yeah).  Why do they do that?  Good question!  Probably, they believe that the developer of the tool can use it much better.  He has more experience, he is easier to detect false positives and is able to screen them out, he has an eye on real errors and he will not miss them.  This means that potential customers will get a lot more vivid impressions of the first acquaintance with the product than if they themselves poked buttons in it.

      And we thought - what if we act like Coverity?  Unfortunately, we cannot send special forces by helicopter yet.  But what if we try to check the code of potential customers and find the actual software errors in their projects?  Yes, and make a presentation well, or at least a report on the problems found?  For sure, then more potential users will want to buy our tool!  But, of course, no one will give someone else's code to the side, so they decided to try to check the code of potential customers remotely by connecting to their computers from their office.  To whom this is interesting - read on. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>You</b> - free code verification.  Plus, a fun opportunity to watch as an outsider will stumble with a strange code.  Your hands will itch when he passes by a clear mistake that you yourself will notice and find fault with a good sly hack :).  I think it will be interesting.  Stock up on popcorn. <br><br>  <b>We</b> are training on working with other people's projects, training on creating promotional presentations. <br><br><h2>  We will check your work code for FREE, find errors in it and tell you! </h2><br>  So, we want to try a completely new for Russia approach to selling tools for developers.  This has not yet been proposed by anyone!  The idea is simple - if you want us to find some errors in your project using PVS-Studio, then we are ready to connect remotely and do all this on your computer, without transferring the source code to us. <br><br><h2>  Some restrictions for those who are interested in participating in it. </h2><br>  So, we are ready, using a remote access system ( <b>AMMYY Admin or something like that</b> ) to check your project.  A number of conditions to determine that we are suitable for each other: <br><ol><li>  Your company develops projects in C ++, using Visual Studio or C ++ Builder environments. </li><li>  You downloaded and installed the latest version of PVS-Studio. </li><li>  You checked the project and saved the log file.  This log file looks fine and does not contain any obvious problems with the launch of the analysis.  That is, there must be messages found.  We will work with this log.  If something does not work out - write to us. </li><li>  YOU DISCUSSED THIS OFFER WITH THE CHIEF, AND HE RESOLVED TO LET US INTO THE CODE ‚ÄúTO LOOK‚Äù.  This is a very important point!  Do not forget about it. </li><li>  You have set up and checked any remote connection.  We think that AMMYY Admin is the most appropriate tool, but in the comments it may be prompted by something else. </li></ol><br>  If you are ready to comply with these conditions, <a href="">please write to us</a> with corporate mail and with a full name.  We can not check the projects of people with mail type "Vasilyunchik at mail.ru" or with the code on home computers.  We reserve the right to refuse any project verification without giving a reason. <br><br><h2>  Well, immediately a small FAQ </h2><br><ol><li>  How much does it cost to ‚Äúinvite you to check the project‚Äù?  Is free. </li><li>  If you find mistakes, we will have to pay you?  No, they should not. </li><li>  We liked everything, but we don‚Äôt want to buy a license for PVS-Studio anyway!  Do not buy. </li><li>  But I have a home hobby project here ... No, this offer is only for companies. </li><li>  Here you check our code, and then write a devastating article!  No, information about errors found will not be published in any way. </li><li>  And why do you need it?  Ideally, we want to sell our instrument.  The initial task is to learn to look for errors in other people's projects in real time "in front of" other people. </li></ol><br><br>  We are waiting for your application for verification of projects in the <a href="">mail</a> !  Even if your company does not plan to buy PVS-Studio, then at least we will find you some errors in the code. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191346/">https://habr.com/ru/post/191346/</a></p>
