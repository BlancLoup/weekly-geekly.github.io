And yesterday, just a few days after the opening, the main character of the evening was Steve Jobs, who for several hours in a row had to answer tricky and not-so-great questions from presenters and viewers. <br><br>  Here are some excerpts from what the legendary CEO of Apple told us.  Compiled from several sources.  The issues discussed at the conference are presented in the form ‚ÄúAnnotation from the translator - Steve's quote‚Äù.  It will be interesting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f58/f51/08a/f58f5108ad4c1474d8b0b9dc264b06e6.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  About capitalization </h2><br>  Naturally, the first question concerned the capitalization of the company, which last week for the first time exceeded that of Microsoft, Kara Swisher even called it ‚Äúsomething unimaginable‚Äù.  The head of Apple replied that in fact this is absolutely not what forces the company's employees to go to work every day. <br>  Steve also agreed with Mossberg‚Äôs comment that in 1997 Apple had one foot in the grave, however, thanks to the ‚Äúamazing people‚Äù who worked hard, the company became more alive than ever.  "The current situation is their merit." <br><br><h2>  Flash technology </h2><br>  The question about the flash did not take the Apple King off guard: since the publication of the open letter, his attitude towards this backward technology has not changed at all.  Jobs gave a couple of interesting examples, telling about the stages of life of some computer things: Apple popularized floppy disks and were the first to abandon them, about the same decision was made in the case of SuperDrive in MacBook Air. <br>  According to Steve, the company is trying to set the right priorities and make a ‚Äúwise‚Äù choice.  And since Adobe was not able to show at least some working version, in the question of web technologies, the choice fell on a bunch of HTML / CSS / JavaScript.  ‚ÄúWe were not going to quarrel with anyone ... They themselves inflated a scandal from all this.  That's why I wrote an open letter, ‚ÄùJobs concluded. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cde/941/5aa/cde9415aaf1d0e578757a8d81955b1bf.jpg">  ‚ÄúWe are not doing this for the first time.  Remember the floppy disks 3.5.  We made it popular.  We got rid of this in the first iMac.  Just like from the parallel port.  The first time you saw USB in iMac.  We were one of the first to abandon the disk drive - it turned out the MacBook Air.  And when we do something like this, many people call us crazy.  It seems that Flash dominates today.  But it is weakening, and it looks like HTML5 will soon take its place. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  Pro adobe </h2><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/609/1e2/bfa/6091e2bfafa61487c72087657265f010.jpg">  ‚ÄúOur solution is dictated only by technology.  We will not achieve positive results by putting this [Flash?] On our platform.  We asked Adobe to show us something better - but they showed nothing.  Adobe didn't care much until the iPad went on sale.  I did not want to fight, just decided not to use one of their developments.  They made a huge problem out of it.  We are tired of these guys. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  About scandalous correspondence about pornography: </h2><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6b/25/6b25392b3162787f0b56bb7230b6873d.jpg">  ‚ÄúHe did not call himself a journalist.  That day I worked until late at night, and then this guy starts writing nasty messages to me ... so I wanted to put him in his place.  And only I got rid of him ... as he also publishes it! " <br><br><h2>  Lost iPhone Prototype </h2><br>  Steve answered this question directly, saying that it is impossible to fully test the operation of a wireless gadget within a closed laboratory, but he does not fully know what happened in that unfortunate bar - whether there was a loss or a prototype was stolen.  Mossberg did not let up and immediately asked a question about the search in the house of the author Gizmodo. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e5/79f/7b5/2e579f7b569713c070c93d20d6491b2a.jpg">  ‚ÄúThe person who found the device decided to sell it, for which he first included the gadget in the neighbor‚Äôs computer.  A neighbor called the police, who did everything appropriate in that case.  At the moment, an investigation is underway and I do not know how it will end. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  About suicides at Foxconn factories </h2><br>  Foxconn factories that assemble Apple technology are suicidal with enviable consistency: 14 people have already committed suicide.  This hot topic did not bypass the main guest of the D8 conference.  Steve Jobs looked puzzled at that moment.  He said that he did not have all the information.  On the one hand, it is a closed industrial complex for 400,000 people, but on the other hand, all conditions are created for the life and work of people: workers can safely go to restaurants, cinemas, visit gyms and swimming pools. <br>  And at the same time, all these suicides are very alarming, even though the percentage of these cases is much lower than in the US (11 idiots per 100,000 population). <br><br><img align="left" src="http://t1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:V8TtBPxUCzNMpM:http://news.liveinternet.ru/images/news/15592/93_s0.jpg">  ‚ÄúWe are carefully looking at all this, because we are accustomed to controlling the situation in such companies.  I can tell you some things.  Foxconn is not what the media does.  Although this is a factory ... but e-my, there are even restaurants and cinemas there.  And yet it is primarily a factory.  They employ 400 thousand people, and only a few committed suicide.  Even in the USA, statistics are worse, but this does not change the attitude to the case. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  About what happens between Apple and Google </h2><br>  ‚ÄúThere can be no talk of any war,‚Äù says Jobs.  According to him, companies simply intersect in some markets (smartphones and software products), with the result that only users benefit from the rivalry, because they make the choice by purchasing it for ‚Äútheir hard-earned money‚Äù. <br>  Steve once again said that it was not the first Cupertino that began to put a speck on the wheels of its partners: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt launch our own search engine, it‚Äôs Google that made our smartphone‚Äù.  And while the company has no plans to engage in the search business. <br><br>  In addition, last week began to appear active rumors that in the "heat of hostility" Apple decided to get rid of Google services in the new firmware.  Jobs dispelled these rumors, saying that this is not true, "because people like it." <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/456/56c/e0e/45656ce0ece447a8a8970c4d5190d7d7.jpg">  ‚ÄúWe never feuded.  We didn‚Äôt have any war with Microsoft, and that‚Äôs probably why we lost.  We just wanted to do the best thing, create the best product.  They decided to compete with us ... still compete. " <br><br><h2>  How the way the iPhone OS began </h2><br>  Steve Jobs would never release a computer with a stylus now - in this case, the device is inevitably waiting for a complete failure: fingers, fingers and fingers again - this is what a person uses every day. <br>  It is very interesting that in the early 2000s, Apple‚Äôs ‚Äúsecret unit‚Äù worked not on the iPhone, but on the prototype iPad.  After half a year after the start of work (at the first presentation of the future tablet) in Jobs‚Äôs head, only one thought was constantly spinning: ‚ÄúIs it possible to make a phone out of this?‚Äù to work on the iPad. <br>  But about his future, Steve said a few interesting things: the device is now almost perfect, because you can do anything with it.  The software is getting better and better, in the near future it will be possible to edit videos, photos and do things that were previously available only for desktop systems.  If Internet media drives in, then the iPad will become even more popular, and everyone will benefit from it: users will read news on the Internet, and publications will earn money from a subscription that is cheaper to do :) <br><br><img align="left" src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:PH3yQSn7mKZ-YM:http://news.liveinternet.ru/images/news/2180/58_s0.jpg">  ‚ÄúIn general, we started with the development of a tablet.  I had an idea about the display under the glass with multitouch technology, on which you could easily print text.  I asked around in the company, who has what about this.  And after six months they came to me with a great display.  I gave it to our talented interface developers.  They developed inertial scrolling and other interesting things.  I thought, ‚ÄúGod, we can make a phone out of it all,‚Äù and we put the tablet idea aside and started working on the phone. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  About iPad's effect on print media </h2><br><img align="left" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:cLVQRd_75uEY6M:http://news.liveinternet.ru/images/news/18149/44_s0.jpg">  ‚ÄúI believe that one of the main elements of a free society is a free press.  We see what happens with newspapers in the USA today.  I think they are very important.  I can say as one of the main participants of the online content market - it is necessary to set aggressive prices and increase volumes.  For us, it worked.  Now I am trying to convey this idea to the press.  They will need to change the approach used now in the printing process. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  Whether the tablet will replace the desktop computer </h2><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5f2/c52/396/5f2c5239671f5096335e369f7a56802d.jpg">  ‚ÄúWhen we were an‚Äú agricultural ‚Äùnation, all the cars on the continent were trucks.  However, over time, people began to move to the cities and change to cars.  I think the PC is now like a truck.  Fewer people will need them. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  About the ‚Äúopenness‚Äù of the iPhone OS platform and the App Store </h2><br><img align="left" src="http://t3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:55KnKE917S_j4M:http://www.brand-zen.com/image.php%3Fu%3D35%26dateline%3D1167726660">  ‚ÄúWe support two platforms today.  The first and free is HTML5.  We support HTML5.  We are ready to support this technology anywhere.  The second and controlled - App Store.  How do we control?  A lot of people work on it every day.  We have a few rules: an application should do what the description says should not hang and crash, should not use third-party APIs.  By these three rules every day we weed out a large number of programs.  However, 95% are being tested and published in the App Store. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  About developers who complain about failures in the publication of applications </h2><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cde/941/5aa/cde9415aaf1d0e578757a8d81955b1bf.jpg">  ‚ÄúThe problem is that people are lying.  They run to the media and tell stories about the pressure on them, getting their fifteen minutes of fame.  And we do not run to the media and do not say: ‚ÄúThis son of a bitch is a liar!‚Äù We don‚Äôt do that, no. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  What does Steve do every day in the company </h2><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/4b/be/4bbe5ec8d01a04bb1216811d6fd68a66.jpg">  ‚ÄúOne of the key moments at Apple is that we always work together.  Do you know how many different committees at Apple?  Zero.  We are extremely organized on our own.  Perhaps the most organized on the planet.  We gather in the morning for three hours and talk about everything: about business, about what generally happens in the world.  We succeeded in gathering great teams and distributing tasks among them.  Therefore, every day everything that I do - I communicate with these teams. " <br><br><h2>  About what Steve plans to do in the next 10 years </h2><br><img align="left" src="http://t0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:phaMq8jEMpvR4M:http://computerby.com/icon_set/apple_logo.jpg">  ‚ÄúSince the beginning of our work, our main goal has not changed.  We went all the way with one desire - to make the best products.  Nothing cheers me up all day like a random letter about how much a person is happy with his new iPad.  This is what gives me the strength to continue working.  This is what gave me strength before, gives and will give in the future.
