  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The first open mass course of MIPT on the Coursera platform begins in 3 days</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On February 17, 2014, the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology was the first Russian university to launch an online educational course on the Coursera platform.  The course "Electricity and Magnetism" is designed for 10 weeks of study with additional time to perform two examinations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b98/095/083/b98095083181874833081673ae9be1c7.jpg"><br><br>  The course is designed for a wide audience of those who want to learn or remember the physics of electricity and magnetism.  Students will become familiar with the fundamental concepts of charge, potential, field, and current.  Learn and learn to use the basic laws of electricity, which will allow them to better understand the world around.

      So it is written in the official press release.  In the same post I would like to add some details about what awaits on the course, how it was done and why. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What awaits inside </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/jN-sBH-5VcA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgY1XvCiJLTQNJnSTGudgYp41PNyw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Traditionally, for courses in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massive_open_online_course">MOOC</a> format, all content is divided into small logical fragments of 8-12 minutes, interspersed with questions to check the concentration.  The fragments themselves are of three types: theoretical material, demonstrations of physical phenomena and seminars with an overview of approaches to solving problems. <br><br>  At the end of each week homework is given, which can be done during the week.  And in the middle and at the end of the course there will be quizzes, the solution of which is allocated weekly.  In addition, for those who love more difficult, we have prepared an additional test with three tasks of increased complexity, the solutions of which are likely to be checked manually. <br><br>  In addition, for those who want to read the results of the course as an entrance exam in physics for the magistracy of MIPT, after checking the additional test work there will be an opportunity to pass an online interview in physics. <br><br>  For each week, a brief summary of the material presented.  Texts and solutions of all tasks that are used in the seminars are also available. <br><br>  The course lecturers included some of the most famous MIPT teachers: Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation, Head of the National Team Team of Russian Schoolchildren at the International Physics Olympiads, Professor of MIPT Stanislav Kozel, Associate Professor of the General Physics Department of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, laureate of the Dynasty Foundation in the category "Instructor of Future Scientists ¬ªVladimir Ovchinkin and Andrei Gavrikov, Associate Professor of the Department of General Physics. <br><br><h4>  How and why did </h4><br>  As in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mipt/blog/211448/">case of iTunesU, it</a> all started with an open <a href="http://lectoriy.mipt.ru/">video lecture of MIPT</a> .  At its base, we slowly formed a set of open educational materials in the general physics course, and we all thought that with these materials we could make more interesting things. <br><br>  The first time the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a MOOC on the basis of developments arose after the MITx <a href="https://6002x.mitx.mit.edu/">Circuits &amp; Electronics</a> course came into view.  The course was really cool, but the mass courses in Russia at that time were a wonder.  Therefore, at that moment the idea did not take off.  We returned to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking a MOOC after a random meeting of MIPT graduates with Dafna Koller from Coursera at some of the events.  Then Fiztech was invited to become Coursera partners and the course preparation process began.  And we were repelled by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmaking MOOC based on materials in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare">OCW</a> format, which we already had by that time (a number of courses at MIT and Caltech, for example, courses in general physics) were done in exactly the same way. <br><br>  It's early to talk about some results and experience (after all, the course is just beginning).  However, I will outline a few points that made me think about it. <br><br>  The first thing we realized when we reviewed the existing developments once again was that not all of the footage could be used.  Approximately half had to be discarded and re-shot again.  Most of the effort went into filming demonstrations of physical phenomena, which were filmed more than 50. <br><br>  The second thing that made you think was the structure of homework and examinations.  It is too early to say anything now, the practice will make its own adjustments. <br><br>  The third point to which attention had to be paid is the evaluation system.  Frighteningly many different parameters, each of which can be tweaked to achieve the desired result. <br><br>  Fourth - the organization of forums.  If you read the "best practices" in conducting mass online courses, then this is almost the central element of training.  On the other hand, the process of organizing communication in forums in such a way that students do not merge solutions to each other, but discuss something useful, helping them to better understand the obvious, not immediately. <br><br>  At the moment, that's all I can write about the launch. <br><br>  Well, after 3 days you will have the opportunity to see what happened with us.  We are waiting for you on the course " <a href="http://mipt.ru/about/departments/liot/coursera.php">Electricity and Magnetism</a> "! <br><br>  PS And we are doubly waiting for recommendations, suggestions and feedback.  You can <a href="">send</a> them to a specially e-mail box <a href="">mooc-feedback@mipt.ru</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> .  The most popular question asked by mail is: ‚ÄúWhere do you need to come / come to listen to lectures?‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/212635/">https://habr.com/ru/post/212635/</a></p>
