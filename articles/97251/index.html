Virus ‚ÄúVery funny‚Äù or ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù: </h4>  This virus appeared on the Internet in 2000 and hit graphic and sound files in user systems.  It could be calculated by the phrase ‚ÄúVery funny joke‚Äù or ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù contained in the subject of the email.  Thus, the virus was sent everywhere, the new malicious version erased the important files needed to start the computer.  These are ‚ÄúHappy Mother's Day‚Äù messages or a Lithuanian way to get acquainted - some e-mail messages came with the note ‚ÄúLet's meet over a cup of coffee‚Äù, in Lithuanian, of course.  When developing more complex versions of the virus, the creators took into account the unsuccessful experience of predecessors, who instilled fear in users, and pretended to be representatives of antivirus providers.  They asked users to run the attached file to destroy all viruses on the computer! <br><br><img src="http://s19.radikal.ru/i192/1006/62/5517ba52fcbe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Heck!</i>  <i>But Saturday was the favorite day of the week!</i>

    <h4>  2. Virus CHPS (HPS): </h4>  The first version of this virus was created for the operating system Windows 98. The name of the virus was in honor of the deadly disease transmitted by rats.  Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome affects the upper respiratory tract of a person, but the digital namesake of the syndrome was not so dangerous.  While on your system, the HPS virus came into effect on Saturdays and turned over uncompressed bitmaps of graphic objects.  Simply put, he created a mirror image of your screen.  An interesting fact: the virus began to spread on the network in early 1998, long before the Windows 98 operating system went on sale. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <i>So that's why you are against drugs?</i> <br><br><h4>  3. Virus Under the high, or Marijuana virus: </h4>  A virus from the Stone Age computer era.  He hit early versions of the DOS system through a floppy disk drive.  The virus was first seen in New Zealand in 1988.  The original version did not cause him much harm, the message just appeared on the screen: ‚ÄúYour computer is high.  Legalize marijuana. ‚Äù  However, the version of the 90s.  of the virus Under the high (distributed under the names of Donald Duck, Hawaii, Rostov, Smithsonian, Kamennaya Mutation, etc.) has already caused significant damage to the master boot record and the file allocation table on your hard drive. <br><br>  <i>Where were the privacy laws when you needed them?</i> <br><br><h4>  4. Virus PolyPoster (PolyPoster): </h4>  Remember how a talking parrot could embarrass you by loosening your secrets?  Actually, this virus caught the activity of the parrot and continued its work.  Known as a macro virus, PolyPoster not only hit your MS Word files, but also published them in thematic conferences on the web without your knowledge under the mysterious title ‚ÄúImportant Information about Monica Lewinsky‚Äù.  The virus wandered into the computers of all those who read these documents, which explains the connection with Lewinsky - the creator of the virus, obviously, was hoping to benefit from the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal, which bypassed all the headlines in 1998.  Among the popular topic groups that invited readers to familiarize themselves with your secret and personal documents (thanks to the PolyPoster virus) were alt.sex.stories, alt.hacker, alt.binaries.pictures.erotica, alt.fan.hanson, alt.windows95, and alt.skinheads. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b6f/e74/f23/b6fe74f2310f946147629f24079197a9.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Caricature?</i>  <i>Comics?</i>  <i>No, Clinton.</i> <br><br><h4>  5. Worm Carik-A (Caric-A): </h4>  Former US President Bill Clinton provided a lot of information for eating greedy sharks by writing during his tenure at the White House, as this famous worm proved in 2002.  The malicious program, also known as the worm Bill Clinton and MyLife-B, was activated after opening the attachment in an e-mail message and was a caricature of Bill Clinton playing the saxophone, from the hole of which the bra was blown.  The creators of this worm tried to look solid: at the end of the letter it was reported that the supplier of antivirus McAfee allegedly confirms the absence of viruses in the message. <br><br>  <i>Hidden threat in the guise of fun</i> <br><br><h4>  6. Wurmark worm: </h4>  Appearing on the Internet in 2005, the Wurmark-F worm was hidden in the image of a funny little man.  When it got into your computer, the worm installed Troyan, which in turn allowed remote hackers to take possession of your infected system.  Your computer was a six of them and was used to spread the worm further through the network.  The worm also randomly deleted files from your system and sent itself to all your contacts via mail via Outlook under your login. <br><br>  <i>The mind is behind all this.</i> <br><br><h4>  7. Mind Virus (Brain): </h4>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo Pakistani brothers in 1986 was not originally in the creation of the virus itself.  The brothers created it with the intention of protecting their medical programs from pirates.  As a result, this led to the appearance of the very first virus that threatens the security of a computer.  This rather large virus, known by various names such as Lahore, Pakistani, Pakistani Brain, Brain-A, UIUC, Ashar and Pakistani flu, damaged the launch sector, changed the label of the disc to ¬© Brain and displayed the following text: <br>  Welcome to Dungeon ¬© 1986 Brain &amp; Amjads (pvt) Ltd VIRUS_SHOE RECORD V9.0 Dedicated to the dynamic memory of millions of viruses that are no longer with us - THANK GOD !!!  BEWARE OF THE VIRUS er ...: this program is a catching program following these messages .... $ # @% $ @ !!! <br>  in bad launch sectors.  He also occupied 7 KB in memory and slowed down the work of a floppy disk drive.  Perhaps the brothers really didn‚Äôt want to do any harm, since another similar message gave out their names, address and phone numbers asking them to contact them in order to receive the vaccine.  Due to the influx of angry calls from the United States and other Western countries, they had to flee and urgently change the number! <br><br>  <i>Is your phone safe?</i> <br><br><h4>  8. Trojan Horse - Skulls: </h4>  Lightning fast development of mobile technology meant that malware developers are already somewhere nearby.  In 2004, the Trojan Horse appeared, roaming freely on Nokia smartphones, which hit the Symbian operating system.  Users whose phones hit Skulls A could see formidable skulls and crossbones instead of the usual icons on the screen, and the device itself worked like a simple phone.  One could only make and receive calls, and the functions of the smartphone were completely atrophied.  Skulls and Skulls A spawned a mass of alphabetic versions of type B, C and L, each of which hit the phone in its own way.  Version B made the phone useless for use, as well as A, but the skulls were not displayed.  Version C tried to block the anti-virus program F-Secure.  L was, perhaps, the most malicious version - it pretended to be an anti-virus program for mobile phones F-Secure.  All versions of Troyan installed the Cabir worm on the phone system.  This experimental malware for mobile phones was transmitted via a Bluetooth connection and discharged the device's battery by constantly searching for other phones with Bluetooth enabled for the purpose of infection. <br><br>  <i>I bet that you did not know - the bites of an ordinary mosquito are more harmful than the bites of a malarial.</i> <br><br><h4>  9. Trojan Horse - Mosquito: </h4>  The Symbian operating system was targeted by another virus in 2004 - this time the Trojan Mosquito.  This program, developed to combat piracy, hit phones when trying to download an unlicensed version of Komar, a game for smartphones.  As soon as the virus got into the phone, he started sending SMS messages at an exorbitant price to the elite numbers of the UK, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland without the knowledge of the owners.  It was easy to get rid of this virus - all that was needed was to remove the game from the device, which probably would have been done immediately after receiving kilometer-long phone bills. <br><br>  <i>Open windows windows - a signal to the invasion of hackers?</i> <br><br><h4>  10. Cuebot-K worm: </h4>  Microsoft and the differences - it seems, the concept of one character.  The software leader has been heavily criticized for creating the Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) anti-piracy program.  Users complained that the software was not only a form of espionage, but it also allowed malware to access a computer over the Internet.  The company released an update to satisfy the needs of angry users, which only added to Microsoft‚Äôs problems, as the virus creators took advantage of and developed the Cuebot-K worm.  Released in 2006, the program was distributed on the Internet, posing as the update and settling in mailboxes from supposedly known AOL contacts.  He started to work when the system was started and - oh, horror!  - there was a message that the elimination or suspension of this service will lead to instability of the system.  Hiding under the title ‚ÄúWindows Genuine Advantage Software Verification Notice‚Äù, the worm opens a secret door for access by hackers who are trying to seize the user system. <br><br>  Today, malware is not dangerous.  Hackers do this out of revenge - they want more money than fame.  Much is at stake, so be sure to protect your computer from the countless threats that roam the network all day long.  However, it is not enough to install the best antivirus program and constantly update security patches - be extremely careful not to fall for the tricks of those viruses that are trying to get into your system, despite the protection programs.  As can be seen from the list, there are no absolutely safe attachments in emails, and following the links indicated in the messages is always risky.  Do not lose vigilance, be always careful and quick-witted in those situations when you need to protect your computer from threats. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97251/</a></p>
