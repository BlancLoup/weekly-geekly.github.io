They became thinner, more productive and more functional.  Over time, almost all models have become similar to each other, their functionality is also close, if we talk about devices in an equal price category.  What is waiting for phones in the future, what will change and how? <br><br>  In principle, it is difficult to predict any changes in the hardware, especially those related to the speed of the phone.  As for the functionality, it is also quite difficult to predict something here.  It is safe to say that nothing new in the near future "will not grow."  But one tendency can be traced explicitly - these are qualitative changes of such an important element as the camera, as well as the associated hardware and software components. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And this is not about building up megapixels - there is no special point in this anymore.  First of all, we are talking about how the camera can help us in everyday life.  Now many applications are tied to it.  For example, there are programs that help you understand whether you are buying good or bad wine right now in a store.  Or those that scan a departure barcode with further tracking analysis.  The translation of the restaurant menu into the native language on the fly is not unusual.

      In the future, augmented reality will probably play a big role.  For example, using a camera, you can place a virtual coffee table in the middle of a real room and see how it will look indoors.  Or check which color of the parquet will suit the new wallpaper. <br><br>  In addition, we can assume that applications for mobile devices will soon learn how to scan three-dimensional objects.  The same Apple corporation announced a whole range of new smartphones, including a premium model, which is able to scan 3D objects, including the owner's face.  The same can be done by a bundle of camera + application Samsung Note 8. Not for nothing in some models of devices is not one camera lens, but two. <br><br>  ‚Äú2018 will be the year when the camera of the phone makes a qualitative leap in its development,‚Äù a Qualcomm spokesman said.  Other experts agree with him who believe that in the near future we will be able to actively use the possibilities of augmented reality.  Already there are many toys that are based on augmented reality.  But this is not only a game, augmented reality can be very useful in solving a wide range of tasks in industry, science and military affairs.  Yes, and in everyday life augmented reality may well be useful. <br><br><h3>  Face scan </h3><br>  The last few years, manufacturers have actively embedded fingerprint scanners into their phones.  In many cases, users liked all of this, since touching the sensor made it possible to turn on the phone or confirm the execution of a function.  But now, most likely, it will be used not a fingerprint, but a ‚Äúface print‚Äù.  In the sense that the phone will scan the face of the person who is looking at the display, and if that person is on the list of allowed users, the phone will be unlocked. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/67f/835/089/67f8350894303fda2cfdbb5a4b7effe7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Again, one of the first to introduce this feature into their devices is Apple.  Perhaps due to the fact that the company acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PrimeSense">PrimeSense</a> , a company that had previously developed sensors for Microsoft Kinect, in 2013. <br><br>  How does all this work?  Can be explained by the example of Spectra, a system from Qualcomm. <br><br>  Part of this system is a module that generates infrared radiation.  And not just like that, the sensor emits rays that fall on various points of the user's face.  The sensor senses feedback and responds accordingly.  Well, for example, evaluates the removal of a person‚Äôs face from a tap or the shape of various parts of a face.  Phone software can make a three-dimensional map of the face, which will fall into the base, about the same way as it happens with fingerprints.  Usually we are talking about creating a mathematical model of the object being analyzed, and not about the fact that, in fact, the photo will be stored somewhere in the phone‚Äôs memory.  From the point of view of information security, the last case is carelessness, which will untie the hands of hackers of all stripes. <br><br>  As for the identification of a specific person, this is not so difficult to do, since the faces of all people, even twins, are unique.  Moreover, since the new systems will work with three-dimensional objects, tricks like using photographs of people (remember the first part of the Terminator, when did the robot incinerate a photo instead of a real person?).  The impression of the face can still be (although in order to say something definite about it, an analysis is needed).  But the photo - no. <br><br><h3>  Augmented Reality </h3><br>  3D cameras can be the key to the further development of augmented reality technology.  Now many developers are creating applications of this kind.  The heads of technology corporations claim that the prospects for augmented reality are vast.  This fall Apple will release the final release of iOS 11, which will support ARKit.  This means that developers can easily create applications of augmented reality. <br><br>  ARKit uses motion sensors and a camera phone, including an accelerometer and a gyroscope.  Thanks to this, the user can not only see the objects of virtual reality on the phone display, but also interact with them. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Arbeh7vSIi8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Above is an example of using augmented reality to see how virtual furniture will look in the corner of a real room.  And not only chairs - any room can be furnished with furniture, change doors, change the color of the stent. <br><br>  It‚Äôs not for nothing that Microsoft is developing its HoloLens glasses, having advanced very far with this project.  Facebook announced the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/technology/mark-zuckerberg-sees-augmented-reality-ecosystem-in-facebook.html%3Fmcubz%3D1%26amp%3B_r%3D0">Camera Effects Platform</a> , an environment for developers who deal with augmented reality applications.  Google is also not lagging behind with its <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/08/29/business/29reuters-google-apple.html%3Fmcubz%3D1">ARCore</a> , a set of tools for Android developers. <br><br><hr><br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dvirtual"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d29/4c3/07d/d294c307dde04335ac3f425e73b36a7a.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/about/mails/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dvirtual"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/417/fe3/7fa417fe3d464fa5aa186b1ab30da53a.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373779/</a></p>
