  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ratings RuTvittera</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Somehow, the Russian Twitter holiday passed unnoticed - today Yandex <a href="http://twitter.com/yandex/status/7706210556">announced</a> that it monitors more than 124 thousand Russian-language accounts, of which more than 100 thousand are from Russia.  The figure turned out to be a bit unexpected for me, since the Yandex microblogging rating shows that it takes into account 88,372 blogs - apparently, the New Year holidays, which the fans who have lost the habit of frost, have had to talk, not far from computers.  Plus, two major generators of new users - the <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/183511/">story of Twitter</a> on NTV, shown in prime time and the <a href="http://echo.msk.ru/videos/647866.html">transfer of Twitter</a> on "Echo of Moscow" ... <br><br>  In general, be that as it may, there are more than 100,000 accounts on Russian-language Twitter today. <br><br>  This is a reason to talk about ratings on Twitter - accustomed to be measured by everything that people can not only want bread and circuses, but also beautiful tsiferok, showing how cool it is compared to all the others.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There are a lot of ratings.  Although, to be honest, not all of them are ratings - a part, just <b>rankings</b> (that is, lists ordered by objective parameter).  In particular: <br><br>  1. <a href="http://twittercounter.com/">TwitterCounter</a> is a large system that allows you to see the lists ordered by the number of followers, and to study the statistics of each individual twitter individual.  Interesting to search for large Western accounts.  For Russian-speaking users it is almost useless, as it allows targeting exclusively in the time zone - it is quite clear that <a href="http://twittercounter.com/pages/country%3Ftime_zone%3DMoscow">TimeZone Moscow</a> , to put it mildly, does not cover the entire RuTwitter. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://www.rutwitter.com/r/">RuTwitter rating</a> is the largest Russian-language ranking using user self-registration.  At the time of preparing the material, 11.113 users are registered on the resource, ranked in the ranking by the number of followers.  Quite an interesting system that allows the user to add additional information about himself - gender, age, interests.  Unfortunately, due to the development of mass-folding in the territory of the former USSR, the first hundred are heavily ‚Äúlittered up‚Äù with accounts that have no place on (sorry, I won‚Äôt).  RuTwitter has <a href="http://www.rutwitter.com/r/antonpopov-r.php">one more</a> information display <a href="http://www.rutwitter.com/r/antonpopov-r.php">option</a> , which can be considered almost a rating - users are sorted by the difference between the Followers and Following indicators, however, the meaning of this rating is not very clear to me. <br><br>  3. <a href="http://twitterrate.ru/user_interface/index/">Clone RuTwitter</a> - more, perhaps, nothing to say.  At the time of writing the post - 628 participants. <br><br>  4. <a href="http://sledui.ru/karma">Twikarma</a> - the most, in my opinion, interesting ranking.  Users are ordered by the so-called ‚Äúrespect indicator‚Äù - the number of tweets that mention the nickname of the rating member and the special hashtag #sledui.  The practical value of the ranking is rather small, as it seems to me, the first places in it are occupied by the ‚Äúmonsters of communication‚Äù, mutually sleeping together.  However, for newcomers to Twitter, the resource can be very useful in terms of searching for people to chat with.  In addition, the project makes the guys with a good sense of humor - an additional plus and justification for existence. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> 5. <a href="http://twitterholic.com/">Twitterholic</a> - Western ranking with something resembling a design from a decade ago.  There is targeting by region (obviously taken from the information in the account).  It is argued that the update is a search spider, however, the data in the <a href="http://twitterholic.com/top100/followers/bylocation/Russia/">Russian subrating</a> may turn out to be half a year old.  In terms of ranking, there are 1,133 twitterers in Russia today. <br><br>  A certain local interest is represented by a couple of <b>specialized ratings</b> : <br><br>  1. <a href="http://favorities.net/users/">Favoritiz</a> is the rating of the smartest twitterites created by fellow <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/dinamyte/" class="user_link">dinamyte</a> .  Very interesting and sometimes instructive thing, rating users based on how their stream of consciousness is converted to Twitter Favorites.  A useful place to find new people, and to join the source of wise / interesting / cheerful thoughts and useful information. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://ru.twirus.com/">TwiRus</a> - rating someone for some criteria.  The authors themselves call the top of the ranking - Ru Popular Tweeps Today;  most likely, we mean the most in-demand twitterers today (and at the same time, the leading Russian hashtags).  The big plus of the project is that it is launched immediately in a multilanguage version.  Although, to be honest, I did not notice any other advantages of this project. <br><br>  And, finally, <b>real ratings</b> (unfortunately, not a single rating has yet published calculation methods, which, naturally, lowers their value, however, from this they have not ceased to be ratings).  Until very recently, there were two ratings, both of which "picked up" the participants by searching, not by self-registration. <br><br>  1. <a href="http://twi.org.ua/">Twitteromania</a> - rating (apparently, Ukrainian), which measures ‚Äútwi-force‚Äù is not a very clear integral indicator.  In my opinion, the most stable rating today.  Calculated once a week;  According to the information on the site, it currently accounts for 36.444 accounts. <br><br>  2. <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/top/twitter">Twitter's blog rating</a> is a product of Yandex that somehow correlates with the main blog rating.  It is located, as I understand it in deep beta, which allows jumps on a rating of 2,000 - 3,000 places a day, regardless of initial conditions.  However, this is a Yandex rating, and even a rating that uses the word ‚Äúcredibility‚Äù in its name.  In general, the most intricate, closed and unstable today counting system, which is nevertheless at the same time the most popular.  88,372 account. <br><br>  And finally (for those who read) - the main character.  With the advent of the new year, @alexkucherov launched the TwiRate <a href="http://twirate.ru/">Russian-speaking Twitter rating</a> (I‚Äôll make a reservation right away - I don‚Äôt have a relationship with the developer - I just like the system and the author‚Äôs willingness to cooperate).  The rating is based on self-registration and literally in a couple of days gathered more than 1,200 users.  The method of calculation is half-open and discussed with the author - in particular, for the first time, calculations are made using user references in Lists (Lists), which makes it possible to effectively cut off both mass-trailers and dull boring accounts. <br><br> <a href="http://twirate.ru/"><img src="http://easycaptures.com/fs/uploaded/213/2675134483.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The formula for calculating the rating and the functionality of the resource are developing every day.  Already we can safely say that the author managed to come up with something new and interesting.  And, most importantly, what will be in demand - no wonder the number of twitter accounts in Russia exceeded 100,000. <br><br>  <b>Disclaimer:</b> I‚Äôll be happy to quote the names of the habrew users who wrote the ratings.  Send the names - the post update will follow with the least possible delay.  If any Russian-language ratings are missed - also ready to correct. <br><br>  PS If necessary, I can be found on <a href="http://twitter.com/CyrilSavitsky">Twitter</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80679/</a></p>
