  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to come up with a game?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Perhaps few habrozhiteley engaged in the development of games professionally.  But, nevertheless, I think some will be able to give practical advice.  These are not necessarily computer games, but primarily games with the creation of the world, although this is not critical either. <br>  I mean the very beginning, which precedes the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580">predation</a> .  On the Internet you can find articles on business processes (communicating with the publisher, etc.), directly programming games.  But about the creation of the concept of the game a word. <br>  I will write my own idea about the beginning of the development of the game.  And also I will be glad to your opinions and comments on this topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. The idea </h3>  The first thing that should be is, of course, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game.  What is the game, a rough idea about the main characters and the world, perhaps there is an abstract idea about the goal of the game or about the condition of victory. <br><h3>  2. Target audience </h3>  After that, in order to form an exact direction for further actions, it is necessary to select the target audience (CA).  It is clear that, while developing a western for teenagers, we will be guided by the ‚ÄúWild Wild West‚Äù, and the western for retirees will be in the spirit of ‚ÄúGold McKenna‚Äù.  Everything depends on the target audience: the plot, the goal of the game, the entourage, the characters, the gameplay, etc. <br><h3>  3. Purpose of the game </h3>  There may be different theories, but I am in favor of the fact that any game that is successful and useful to people should have a goal (or a victory condition).  Moreover, the goal must define the whole concept of the game, otherwise there are many risks, for example, the probability of creating a game that is too complex or too easy to play.  In addition, by clearly defining the terms of winning in the game, we avoid "pinching" the gameplay - both adding necessary and removing unused game features. <br><h3>  4. A way to win </h3>  We need to think of a way to win, or several.  I personally love it when there are no pre-thought out ways to win in the game, perhaps there is some strategy that you can win by sticking to.  The game is interesting when the strategy of victory is not the only one.  So the task of this stage is to make sure that the game has such strategies that are guaranteed to allow you to win.  But the player‚Äôs task is to understand what kind of strategy will lead him to the winning final. <br>  When such strategies are clear, you can already understand what it costs to add to the game world and gameplay, what to leave for the entourage, and what should not be brought into the game at all. <br><h3>  5. Game world </h3>  I think it is time to think about it all the same :). <br>  - Place, time, presence of magic, characters, social order, etc. <br>  - Types of interaction between the characters are possible: battles, duels, conversations, intimate relationships, playing chess, etc. <br>  - Items and skills of the protagonist of the game: either these are armies and cities in strategy, or these weapons and their experience in RPG ownership, or something else. <br>  - Types of interaction of characters with objects: repair, use in battle, use intravenously, etc. <br><br>  Well, then, I think, the predraft and other strength tests begin.  That is, only after passing through the steps described above, it is worth looking for developers, a producer. <br><br>  <b>What do you think: maybe I missed something, missed or mixed up the sequence?</b> <b><br></b>  <b><font color="#00CC00">A big request to abstract from the development of computer games.</font></b> </div>
