      I try to replace the usual creative work, in particular, instead of a different kind of routine, people just come up with how to automate this routine and do it on their own based on their needs (the results turn out to be much better if the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù in the project do it).  In this technological way we achieve the second important factor - creative expression. <br><br>  The company should not have a hierarchy in the usual sense of the word, everyone is on the same level and everyone just does his job.  Here it is important that each employee understands what others are doing, so that he knows what they all do together.  Knowledge, understanding, equal level with others, increased salary (payment by the amount of work is usually 1.5-2 times higher than the average) and the special attitude that is maintained in the team gives a third important factor - a sense of self-worth, respect. <br><br>  Due to this, the person‚Äôs self-esteem rises, his involvement in the company's life increases, in its success, because the company's success is inextricably linked with his personal success.  By the way, it should be said that all employees also receive certain dividends from the company's revenues (either in the form of interest on projects, or in the form of bonuses calculated as a percentage of income, or for some shares, there are many options, but the essence is the same), well and besides, the company must always be ready to provide credit to its employees on preferential terms, let's say so well and a lot more.  Cleaners nafig, let the people clean the office themselves - it unites the team and teaches them to take care of the office and keep it clean :) It is very useful to organize various events, trips outside the city and so on. <br><br>  So here it is so simple, even if it is good company, a way built on human relations and kindness towards each other.  And it is applicable for any company, any size.  Because it can be organized in any of the smallest cells that, when united, will become a single cohesive force. <br><br>  But we must begin the process from the top, first the owner must bring it to the top management, and those in turn to their subordinates, etc., the process is gradual, but useful. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60460/</a></p>
