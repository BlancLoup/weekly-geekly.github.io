Speech in the post will be about the book on photography, in a sense - unique.  100 photographers from all over the world took part in its creation, posting their photos on the site 1x.com.  Each photo in the publication is a work of art, and the author of the photo will tell you about each of them in detail - from the idea and location to the implementation - with a detailed description of the camera settings, focal length, aperture, shutter speed, ISO, etc.  The structure of the publication allows you to study it from any chapter: choose the photo you like and find out in detail how it was taken and processed. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The photos presented in the book are divided by genres:

Abstract photography uses the visual language of lines, contours and colors.  Images are obtained that exist without reference to any particular topic.  They completely lack realistic details, and the viewer's attention is focused on intuitive recognition.  It can be argued that abstract photography is both the most rational and the most intuitive of all the genres of this art.  Abstractionism combines the rational and the irrational in works that inspire both the master and the spectator.  Abstract photos are intelligent and often rather ambiguous. ‚Äù </td></tr><tr><td><br>  ‚Äú <b>Dynamic photography</b> is a genre whose masters are able to snatch a frame during a complex athletic exercise.  In addition, specialists in such photos use extremely wide angles when shooting. <br><br>  This is another example of fixing elusive moments of reality.  Striving for accuracy (no matter how widely this term is interpreted) recedes into the background.  Instead, the artist seeks to influence the viewer, to make him feel not a passive observer, but a participant in the unfolding events. ‚Äù </td><td><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1df/b8d/81a/1dfb8d81af9b4c0fa4e348546458b05d.png"></td></tr><tr><td><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74a/2be/9c6/74a2be9c64344c5e8d3916ea89c840d7.png"></td><td><br>  ‚ÄúBeing engaged in an <b>architectural photo</b> , do not regret time for preparation.  Before you start shooting, consider the building from different angles.  Go around it, try to look for interesting points of view and light compositions.  Especially carefully look for "non-obvious" angles.  Proper composition is a major factor in creating memorable architectural photography.  Stick to the golden rule: less is better.  Let your composition remain simple and clear.  Especially carefully look for interesting silhouettes and lines, and also consider how this or that lighting affects them. ‚Äù </td></tr><tr><td><br><br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is extremely difficult to capture a child in an interesting, unique photo that conveys a one-of-a-kind moment.  If we actually achieve not an average, but a unique frame, the best way to pass <br>  the mood of the moment, you should stock up with remarkable patience.  Children are photographed for many reasons, but one of the most important <br>  ‚ÄúChildren grow quickly and such pictures remain unique reminders of childhood.‚Äù </td><td><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/504/727/f1e/504727f1e9154be189999c655ac22a34.png"></td></tr><tr><td><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e0/f25/094/0e0f250946294da5966cc04fa4eb4a0f.png"></td><td><br><br>  ‚Äú <b>A documentary photo</b> can serve a variety of purposes, from the usual recording of events (a snapshot or an unedited video made at the weekend) to a polemic text designed to convey to the audience a certain set of opinions.  The target audience should catch such a semantic focus very quickly, and therefore refers to the documentary differently than to the artistic narrative.  In addition, it should be remembered that documentary is not limited to reproducing reality.  It is also an art. ‚Äù </td></tr><tr><td><br><br>  ‚ÄúMost of the photos require <b>editing to</b> one degree or another.  This may be, for example, a simple correction of contrast and tones, the conversion of a color image into black and white, a multiple exposure.  Creating a photomontage is already editing a higher order.  In my opinion, image editing is an independent, extensive level of photographic expression.  At the editing stage, we use various elements that together give a distinctive concept or express a burning idea. ‚Äù </td><td><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24f/f2f/e86/24ff2fe8649b4187ac0434f586a138de.png"></td></tr><tr><td><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/675/817/ff4/675817ff4be441ceba0f5785613131f8.png"></td><td><br><br>  ‚ÄúA beautiful <b>landscape frame</b> often begins to be created even before you uncover a camera and press a trigger.  This is a ‚Äúspeculative‚Äù stage in which you can imagine the perfect image and think through all the aspects and details that you want to shoot.  You can arrange objects to achieve optimal balance, represent the type of light with which you would like to complement the scene, and even imagine the desired weather. ‚Äù </td></tr><tr><td><br><br>  ‚Äú <b>Macro photography</b> allows us to multiply the microcosm that surrounds us, as well as the creatures that inhabit it. <br><br>  Some photographers work mostly or exclusively with natural light and do their work in a natural environment.  Others use systems from several sources of illumination and create in a certain sense a studio picture in which the natural environment is only imitated.  In addition to photographing insects, such genres as, in particular, macro photography of small objects and high-speed photography of collision drops, also belong to macrophotography. ‚Äù </td><td><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fe/c08/1ea/0fec081ea7ba481ca23d2209f1de4682.png"></td></tr><tr><td><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98d/d0b/863/98dd0b863e6142c194d6dfe546088490.png"></td><td><br><br>  ‚ÄúPhotographers involved in <b>shooting wildlife</b> , practically can not influence their" models ", compared with colleagues specializing in other genres.  A landscape photographer can only hope for good weather, the right lighting and a beautiful sky.  When shooting wild animals, an additional problem arises: you have to deal with "sitters", which may not seem to you in ideal conditions, but when they please.  Sometimes you can see your hero not in full face and not in profile, but, so to speak, from the rear. ‚Äù </td></tr><tr><td><br><br>  ‚Äú <b>Night and darkness</b> at the same time carried away and frightened a person for many thousands of years.  Darkness takes and frightens a person like that, because it deprives him of the most important of the five senses - sight.  To see, our eyes need light, preferably as much light as possible.  But the artist must be able to consider the possibilities that darkness hides.  Any landscape or scene changes drastically when the light fades.  Some things disappear from sight, while others, on the contrary, become clearer and more beautiful. ‚Äù </td><td><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0e/0ba/f8a/c0e0baf8ab77413cac10395aaff8ae7d.png"></td></tr><tr><td><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28a/cb6/87e/28acb687e09b4c3591c9a4e1a14e51fe.png"></td><td><br><br>  ‚Äú <b>Creating a portrait</b> requires preparation.  I try to shoot portraits no more than once a month.  This process requires putting all the available ideas in the form of a thematic collage, also referred to as the ‚Äúmood board,‚Äù to assemble a good team, find a suitable place and prepare all the requisite details.  This is a long but fruitful process.  Do not forget, by the way, to invite a makeup artist and stylist.  They can greatly decorate your work.  I am convinced that not only one photographer creates a portrait scene.  The entire creative team pushes the shutter button. ‚Äù </td></tr><tr><td><br><br>  ‚Äú <b>Still life</b> is a special genre of photography.  Such a photo is often commercial and is created in advertising. <br>  purposes (based on a specific concept), but not less often pure artistic compositions from various <br>  items.  The subject of photographic still life is inanimate / static objects, and the size of such scenes can range from miniature compositions that fit on the table to much larger sets. ‚Äù </td><td><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/806/329/a7e/806329a7ecea40d49156e0a54afabddb.png"></td></tr><tr><td><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30c/86d/0c8/30c86d0c87e143a59a755f1c9a14376e.png"></td><td><br>  ‚Äú <b>Street photography</b> is the art of graphic documenting and collecting unique moments from the life of the urban civilization surrounding us.  The scene captured in a frame is unique, since the moment with the participation of these particular actors will never arise again. <br>  For example, in landscape photography scenes, as a rule, are static, only light and weather can change seriously.  In street photography, light and weather are also ‚Äúvariables‚Äù, but a much more unpredictable factor is the ever-changing models and set of stage details.  The uniqueness of the picture obtained as a result is determined not only by the situation itself, but also by the way the photographer interacts with the scene.  In the end, it all depends on how the photographer sees the development of the unfolding <br>  before him the situation.  Moreover, the author himself becomes one of the actors.  You need to be able to get closer to the scene as much as possible.
