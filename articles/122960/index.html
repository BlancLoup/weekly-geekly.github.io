For me it was the first experience, and I wanted to understand, I need such a thing or not.  I do not know how suitable the ‚Äúautomotive‚Äù theme is for Habr, but I decided to share my impressions and thoughts about it here - the device is clearly high-tech. <br><br>  So, Highscreen GPS-1699 (aka Black Box) is a ‚Äútwo-way‚Äù video recorder with a built-in GPS receiver and an acceleration sensor.  Accordingly, he writes two video streams, data from GPS (coordinates and speed) and acceleration sensor readings in three axes.  I will not load the technical characteristics (they are on the <a href="http://highscreen.org/products/videorecorder/21-highscreen-black-box">official site</a> ), I‚Äôll better tell you my personal impressions. <br><br>  For recording, microSD cards are used (why micro is not clear, a slot for a large card will easily fit into its case).  The manufacturer promises up to 1 hour of recording per gigabyte, in fact, I did one and a half times less.  But I do not think that the recording duration is a problem, especially since the device supports cards up to 32 GB - a day of video!  Of course, the recording is conducted ‚Äúcyclically‚Äù, that is, there is no need to take care of cleaning the place on the map.

      In general, the device is very easy to use. <a name="habracut"></a>  He opened the package, stuck the holder on the windshield, stuck the wire into the cigarette lighter - and drove off.  It is just as simple to watch the recording - a USB reader for microSD is included, and on the card itself there is a program for viewing (you can not even install it, but simply launch it from the card). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/796e4af1/817f06c7/6664d748/bbd9c395.jpg"><br><br>  Included are spare suction cups for mounting to the glass, as well as an alternative mount on the magnet, which is glued to the torpedo.  The device is powered by its own 12-volt charging with a very long cord (apparently, a special reserve so that you can carry out the wiring under the cabin trim).  On the charging itself (on the part that is inserted into the cigarette lighter) there is an on / off button - fun, but also useful, since there is no possibility of a shutdown on the DVR itself. <br><br>  After switching on, the box starts talking to you in a pleasant female voice - it welcomes you, wishes you a pleasant journey, talks about the status of the recording, warns you about speeding - in general, entertains the lonely driver well <b>;)</b> <br><br>  The manufacturer proudly declares that the device has a huge database of different POI-points (which is also regularly updated via the Internet).  In practice, this means that the ‚Äúblack box‚Äù warns (in the same pleasant voice) about approaching traffic police posts, regular cameras, and even the places where traffic cops are likely to live. <br><br>  Having traveled along several well-known routes (in Moscow and the region), I can say that the base is really up-to-date ‚Äî the device warned me about most of the cameras and ambusions I know.  True, in a few days I got tired of these warnings and I turned off the ‚Äútalker‚Äù - on well-known routes I already know where to slow down. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6f5cdc13/dece9912/8efb6c4c/ff09dbc6.jpg"><br><br>  What in the experimental is not enough?  First, there is no own battery (i.e. offline recording is not possible).  Secondly, there is no small screen - you can‚Äôt watch video without a computer, and all communication with the driver is reduced to a voice interface and a digital indicator. <br><br>  Camera resolution is not a record - 640x480.  Is it enough?  On the one hand, the road situation can be seen well, even with difficult lighting.  On the other hand, license plates are distinguishable only at a short distance.  This will probably suffice to deal with an accident, but it‚Äôs definitely impossible to see the number of the raider on the opposite line. <br><br>  Looking at the quality of the picture, I found it useful to look for examples of recordings from other DVRs, with high resolution (good, now there are many of them - even FullHD models are advertised).  To my small surprise, I found that despite the higher resolution (and larger file size), the clarity of the image in such devices is about the same.  Apparently, the limiting factor here is already the optics, and not the megapixels of the sensor (in principle, this is logical - you should not expect a steep resolution from such a small lens).  So the dream of storing the number of any passing car is not yet feasible. <br><br>  As for the sound quality, it is very decent.  On the recording, you can make out conversations in the cabin even to the music or with the windows open. <br><br>  For the night, and in the daytime parking lots, I took the recorder and dragged it along.  Someone else, but I have a very troubled yard, sometimes hit windows in cars just like that, but already if you can see something valuable ... Honestly, this need to constantly pay attention to the device - connect, disconnect, carry with me - has got me decently.  I even thought about designing a DVR that was hard-wired into the car (did anyone do this?) - I would use such a thing with great pleasure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b5e27b51/88189bee/9dfb3923/0e46015b.jpg"><br><br>  In conclusion, I will share my thoughts on the subject, which, following the results of communication with this device, went in two directions.  First of all, I am sure that the modern ‚Äúblack box‚Äù simply has to be so heaped up - with GPS support, a G-sensor, sound recording and video ‚Äúforward‚Äù and ‚Äúbackward‚Äù.  It gives a much more vivid picture of what is happening than just the picture.  In airplanes, the ‚Äúobjective control system‚Äù still writes all the actions of the pilots, which is also a good idea.  So the recorders of the future should move in that direction. <br><br>  And secondly, the Highscreen Black Box is, in fact, not exactly a DVR.  This is an on-board computer, an assistant driver, reminiscent of the speed limit or a warning about the "ambush".  In my opinion, this is an example of the emergence of a new class of devices.  It remains to supply it with a GSM-module so that it receives updates of its POI database in real time (and at the same time helps to bypass traffic jams) - and the next step in the future will be made.  And if he also will immediately record the recorded video to the server ... <b>;)</b> <br><br>  Well, for a snack for entertainment - I mounted a small video about how I spent a half hour stupidly in a traffic jam on Leningradka.  Do not worry, I do not suggest you spend the same time - the video is accelerated by 40 times, so it was within a minute and a half.  By the way, during this time I just listened to the Moby Play album - and the accelerated video was packed just in half of the wonderful Honey song from this album. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrRKxoUJZI4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgamcIUx-709EGoQbub1jgc3JOaKw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PS In the post I almost did not talk about the direct appointment of the DVR - participation in the analysis of the accident.  Of course, it can be useful in difficult cases.  However, I believe that it is better not to fall into an accident.  You need to drive carefully and always control the situation - no matter how many electronic devices help you.  Well, for those who wish, an excellent selection of "Accident-with-DVR" is in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/117006/">excellent review of another registrar</a> (you can compare the impressions at the same time). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122960/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122960/</a></p>
