In 2013, the total amount was a third less.  According to Fedchin, the revenue from all applications is distributed between the company and the developers exactly 50 to 50. Judging by this amount, the network could gain more if the distribution of income would be somewhat different.  It is not surprising that this is not the only source of income, it also makes a social network with advertising, the proceeds of which are not disclosed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Over the past year, more than five hundred new online games have been released on the social network, and as always, ahead of the rest of the planet are <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">casual games</a> .  The company, on the basis of considerations of mass, knowingly puts the games of this kind in the first place, explaining their wide distribution by simplicity of mechanics and accessibility. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2c2/a32/4c4/2c2a324c41314b9a9e3e3bddf2f66877.png" alt="Mail.Ru Group" align="left">  Today, Odnoklassniki is fully owned by the Mail.ru Group, whose revenues last year amounted to a considerable amount of 35.77 billion rubles.  On user payments, in the reporting segment of which payments for applications fall, the company earned 11.87 billion rubles.  That is, Odnoklassniki brought about 33% to the Mail.ru Group's total piggy bank. <br><br>  At the same time, Mail.Ru Group continues to lose revenues from display advertising, but it maintains revenue growth due to games and user payments for social services.

      The total revenue of Mail.Ru Group in 2014 grew by 14.8% to 35.77 billion rubles, EBITDA - by 13.5% to 18.3 billion rubles, net profit - by 11.4%, to 12.5 billion rubles.  The growth rate of the company's business has slowed.  For comparison: for 2013 its revenue grew by 22%, and a year earlier the growth was 39%. <br><br>  According to Dmitry Grishin, in the fourth quarter of last year, revenues from display advertising, as in the previous two, continued to decline under the influence of the economic and geopolitical situation, and this year the company is going to focus on the development of mobile and video advertising. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f12/797/880/f12797880d0d43b4b2407b94b24a63a4.png" alt="Dmitry Grishin" align="right"><br><br>  Based on future revenue from mobile advertising, the concern will launch a special platform, myTarget, on which advertisers will be able to buy mobile traffic in all applications of the group (previously they had to buy advertising on each separately). <br><br>  Now analysts include the group in the top companies that publish mobile applications, by downloads and profitability.  In this top of the companies with the largest downloads in Russia, Mail.ru Group, according to data for January 2015, ranked second with its portfolio of 142 applications, with the result that the company gave way only to the British company Outfit7, which has 58 applications. .  Facebook (5th place, 44 applications, including WhatsApp and Instagram), and Google (10th place, 191 applications) were left behind. <br><br>  In the ranking of revenues in our country, Mail.ru Group is only sixth.  In the top three are gaming companies Supercell, Machine Zone and Wargaming.net. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286594/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286594/</a></p>
