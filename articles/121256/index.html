Or, on the contrary, start doing something good, useful.  In short, to accustom yourself to something. <br><br>  Most often, on the way to achieving such a goal, the main obstacles are personal laziness and irresponsibility, and the further the goal is, the more they interfere.  I had an idea how to deal with them, and I decided to share it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/28fe7e3f/59b491b3/df73c395/f12d64a2.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Why are we too lazy? </h4><br>  We often make excuses for ourselves like ‚Äúwell, everything, today is the last time, from tomorrow - a new life‚Äù, or ‚ÄúI cannot today, but I will definitely do it tomorrow‚Äù.  The main reason for the irresponsible attitude to the goal is a lack of control.  Why do you get up every morning to work?  Because the boss controls you.  Why are you afraid of being late?  Because you have to write explanatory and make excuses.

      When you are your own boss, you can allow yourself to go out, and that's the problem.  You are not justified by anyone, and that is the problem.  In fact, sometimes you really cannot do what you promised yourself, but such a small ‚Äúday off‚Äù can break everything, and that‚Äôs the problem. <br><br><h4>  And what does Sasha offer? </h4><br>  And that's what.  To get started, set a goal, decide how much time you need to develop a habit. <br>  <i>I want to grow up.</i>  <i>For this, I'm going to hang on the bar in the evenings, and it seems to me that 2 months is enough to get used to.</i> <br><br>  Next, create something like a ‚Äúreport form.‚Äù  Let it be a sign corresponding to the scheduled period, and a separate field of "justification".  Let this form be in a prominent place, let it remind you of what you should get used to, what you need to train yourself. <br>  <i>I scribbled the plate for two months, hung it on the wall by the bed.</i> <br><br>  And the last.  Report to yourself within the scheduled time.  They did what they promised - just put a tick in the cell with the corresponding date, it does not take much time.  But if you drop it in a net, take a pencil and describe yourself in detail why you did not keep your promise.  In this case, you understand that in fact did not break the process of habituation, but just slightly suspended it.  You realize why you broke the habit, and therefore you understand that tomorrow the same excuse will not work - it means you will not be able to walk. <br>  Report back to yourself.  When you become too lazy to invent another excuse - do your duty, and feel free to tick. <br>  <i>June 13, 2011. Could not hang on the horizontal bar.</i>  <i>Reason: I wrote an article on Habr, I wanted to share the idea with the public.</i>  <i>Tomorrow I will definitely add and become higher.</i> <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I have no idea if this is valid or not.  One thing I can say: I'll hang myself this sheet tomorrow, I will train myself.  Perhaps someone will consider this a stupid and senseless undertaking - I sincerely envy the will of such people.  But who knows - perhaps this technique will really help someone.  I'll hope. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121256/</a></p>
