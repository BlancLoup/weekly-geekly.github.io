    <h2>  Who comes to the technopark </h2><br>  According to Olesya Baranyuk, deputy director of Technopark, the profile of the university (information and photon technologies) creates a focus for resident companies - businesses associated with scientific developments come to Technopark first of all.  But not only in the field of informatics and optics - now the Technopark hosts projects from the following areas: <br><br><ul><li>  AR / VR </li><li>  Robotics </li><li>  AI systems </li><li>  Microelectronics </li><li>  Nanotechnology </li></ul><br><blockquote>  Recently, more companies developing in the field of Life Science have started coming, and it is very interesting for us to cooperate with them.  We already have companies that create solutions in the field of biopharmaceuticals, biomedical technologies and services, bioinformatics technologies, medical instrumentation and healthcare, and in the near future we plan to expand the presence of such companies. <br><br>  - Olesya Baranyuk, ITMO University Technopark </blockquote><br>  The managers of the following projects took part in the creation of today's material. <br><br><h4>  Ontodia </h4><br>  <a href="http://ontodia.org/">Ontodia</a> is a platform for visualizing and exploring graph-based data.  Graph data is data built on the model of vertices and the connections between them.  The project also works with the most well-known graph data store - Neo4j.  One of the examples of projects using Ontodia technology is the Business Topology <a href="https://tree.datafabric.cc/">service</a> .  The Ontodia project is at the stage of a market product, which continues to be improved and improved. <br><br><blockquote>  At the time of becoming a resident, our project was at the initial stage.  In principle, there was only a basic idea and nothing more. <br><br>  - Dmitry Pavlov, commercial director of VISmart (the company-creator of the Ontodia platform) </blockquote><br><h4>  odgAssist </h4><br>  The <a href="http://optimal-drive.ru/">odgAssist</a> project helps manufacturing (in particular, pharmaceutical) companies create new products and bring them to market faster.  Namely - allows you to automate the work of staff at the lower level (through the use of wearable devices for data collection and monitoring processes for compliance, in particular, in the format of the employee‚Äôs ‚Äúworking day photo‚Äù).  Such an approach allows reducing the speed of launching an innovative product to the market by 20% and seriously save on expenses.  The company has first sales. <br><br><blockquote>  [At the time of obtaining resident status, the project was at the stage of:] MVP [minimally viable product], 1 implementation, 1 contract for the approach. <br><br>  ‚ÄîOleg Shakhov Business Development Director, Optimal Motion Company (developing the odgAssist project) </blockquote><br><h4>  Orbi </h4><br>  <a href="https://rec360.ru/news/orbi-prime.htm">Orbi</a> company is developing the world's first glasses for shooting video in 360-degree format.  These are sunglasses, in which 4 cameras are built in, allowing you to shoot a full panorama in 360 format. The project conducted a successful crowdfunding campaign on Indiegogo, and also attracted significant funding from private investors.  At the moment, Orbi has developed unique software for pasting panoramas from 4 video streams, running on main desktop and mobile platforms and allowing to get high-quality panoramic video in fully automatic mode (without user intervention).  At the moment, the prototype of the device in the final design went into production.  It will be ready by mid-November 2017. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ht5pBpG7qZM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><blockquote>  [At the time of appearance in Technopark] we were at the stage of active software development, although our development team consisted of only three programmers.  We also actively sought a suitable solution for the device itself (processor, optics, sensors, and so on) and the manufacturer who can make this device.  At that time, we had already launched a campaign on Indigegogo. <br><br>  - Alexander Moreno, Technical Director, Orbi </blockquote><br><h4>  Parseq lab </h4><br>  The company is engaged in the development and implementation of integrated biomedical solutions based on high-performance genome sequencing technology.  <a href="http://parseq.pro/about_ru">Parseq Lab</a> develops reagent kits and data analysis software.  The company's developments are used in medicine, forensics, research in Russia and abroad.  A series of products has already been introduced to the market, some developments are at the design or testing stage. <br><br><blockquote>  [The state at the time of obtaining the resident status:] the pilot development entered the market. <br><br>  - Alexander Pavlov, Director of Parseq Lab </blockquote><br><h2>  Why should companies come to Technopark </h2><br>  Some resident projects are initially associated with the ITMO University (more on this below), therefore, the choice of site for placement is obvious for them.  Others choose from a variety of alternatives - this is how company executives talk about this: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Proximity to scientific developments</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  We thought it was good to be close to the center of competence in the area in which we decided to develop our product.  So far, it seems to us that our decision to become a resident of Technopark was right. <br><br>  - Dmitry Pavlov, VISmart </blockquote></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Serious infrastructure and networking</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  We were looking for a place to innovate.  We needed the infrastructure to run the project.  And we needed not only a table and a chair, but also the opportunity to interact with other innovative enterprises, get access to interesting events and events, and much more. <br><br>  First, we decided that we need a technology park.  Still, starting with support is a little easier.  Then we monitored 4 leading technology parks in St. Petersburg.  As a result, ITMO Technopark became the undisputed leader.  In addition, the founders already had contacts with residents, which was very convenient for us.  We also liked the atmosphere of the technopark and its representatives. <br><br>  - Oleg Shakhov, odgAssist </blockquote></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Platform for business expansion</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  A year ago, when the project reached a certain stage, it became necessary to expand and find a suitable place for further work on the development. <br><br>  Having found the ITMO Technopark on the Internet, having learned all the conditions and advantages of posting in it, and also finding that among its residents there are already those who work in the field of 360 videos, we realized that this is the place where we can most effectively develop your project. <br><br>  - Alexander Moreno, Orbi </blockquote></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Interaction with the management of Technopark</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  First of all, [for us it was important] the leadership's willingness to meet halfway when deciding on placement issues.  Good infrastructure and location Technopark. <br><br>  - Alexander Pavlov, Parseq Lab </blockquote></div></div><br><h2>  How to become a resident </h2><br>  An application for resident status can be submitted on <a href="http://technopark.ifmo.ru/kak-stat-rezidentom/">the</a> Technopark <a href="http://technopark.ifmo.ru/kak-stat-rezidentom/">website</a> at any time.  The expert council reviews it for 2-3 days, after which it is decided whether to take the project into the ITMO ‚Äúfamily‚Äù or not.  This decision is followed by a meeting with representatives of Technopark. <br><br>  Who becomes resident: <br><br><ul><li>  Technological projects (initial communication with ITMO University, optional presence of scientists or students of the University) </li><li>  Small Innovative Enterprises (ITMO University is a co-founder of such enterprises, they are located in the Technopark as a priority) </li><li>  Corporate research centers </li></ul><br><blockquote>  Quite often, large corporations turn to us with the request to place their R &amp; D centers in Technopark in order to be able to be in the epicenter of innovation activity, cooperate with the University research units and technopark residents, and also gradually form a portfolio of innovative products. <br><br>  - Olesya Baranyuk, ITMO University Technopark </blockquote><br>  What experts pay attention when selecting applications: <br><br><ul><li>  Innovative component </li><li>  Competitive advantages over peers </li><li>  Understanding the market, the availability of first sales </li><li>  The ability to create places for students of the ITMO University to practice with subsequent employment </li></ul><br>  We asked the heads of the resident companies to remember how they went through the selection process and what they thought was most important for the experts in their projects: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Team</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  We came to the Technopark with several projects at different stages of readiness, of which only 50% survived.  It seems to us that we are more interested in Technopark as a team. <br><br>  In this regard, I would recommend candidates for residents to pay attention to the presentation of their team.  The direction of activity may change, but the team is a quantity, in my opinion, more permanent and important than a project that seems strong. <br><br>  - Dmitry Pavlov, VISmart </blockquote></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">MVP, recommendations from residents and realistic approach</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  I can say this about our project: we had recommendations from residents, we prepared for the meeting.  I don‚Äôt think that it‚Äôs difficult to get into the technopark if you have a suitable project, there is a MVP (I think this is important) and a realistic plan.  And yes - if you are doing innovation, and not an online store or advertising agency. <br><br>  We decently dressed for the meeting, told our entire history, were honest, showed ourselves to be professionals, realists.  Showed that we are sick of their work. <br><br>  - Oleg Shakhov, odgAssist </blockquote></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Compliance with the thematic focus of Technopark</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  We are developing an innovative device that is really at the forefront of modern technologies in the field of camera industry (for example, the processor and lenses we use have just appeared on the market, just a year ago, nothing of the kind existed in principle).  The 360 ‚Äã‚Äãvideo area itself is new and very actively developing. <br><br>  Plus, the main focus of our activity on the basis of Technopark is software development, which is clearly close to both Technoprac itself and ITMO University as a whole.  We expressed willingness to actively participate in the life of the Technopark, which is also very important. <br><br>  Advice - I think that at the meeting it is important to focus on how your project is suitable for its focus Technopark.  If among the residents there are already companies with which you could cooperate fruitfully, this will be a very good argument.  Well, it is important to be ready to actively participate in the life of the Technopark. <br><br>  As for potential investors, the presence in their portfolio of companies with which you could fruitfully cooperate, will also be a serious advantage.  However, first of all investors, especially at the earliest stages, evaluate not only the project, but also you yourself.  It is important to present not only the idea - this is not enough.  It is necessary to present the team, and convince them [the Technopark management and / or investors] that you are the people who can best implement this project. <br><br>  - Alexander Moreno, Orbi </blockquote></div></div><br>  The proximity to the areas in which Technopark specializes and which are studied at ITMO University, in this case, is an important criterion.  A ‚Äúclose in profile‚Äù project will be able to attract students and postgraduates from the University to its work - moreover, those who are well versed in the subject of the project: <br><br><blockquote>  We have several companies that create solutions in the field of DNA diagnosis of severe hereditary diseases;  personal identification solutions based on high-performance sequencing technology;  deal with the creation of infrastructure for analyzing and storing genomic data;  the development of gene therapy aimed at defeating old age, oncology and even HIV. <br><br>  The area for the University is not profile, but, nevertheless, the University is developing such a direction as Bioinformatics within the Laboratory and the Institute of Bioinformatics [by the way, we told about this direction in one of our materials], and the presence of residents with unique competencies in this area is significantly increases the research opportunities of students, graduate students and research staff. <br><br>  - Olesya Baranyuk, ITMO University Technopark </blockquote><br><h2>  How resident projects interact with ITMO University </h2><br>  <b>Scientific support</b> <br><br>  Both interns and major scientists can participate in the project, and not only from the ITMO University: <br><br><blockquote> At the moment, we have a rather interesting case of interaction between the residents of Technopark, University staff and an employee of the Vienna University of Economics.  Resident of Technopark, the company VISmart is developing software in the field of semantic web.  It cooperates quite closely with the International Laboratory of the ITMO University ‚ÄúIntellectual methods of information processing and semantic technologies‚Äù (several VISmart employees are also employees of the international laboratory and vice versa). <br><br>  The service, on which the VISmart team worked, was very interested in the assistant professor at the Vienna University of Economics, Gerhard Wolgenannt, which led him first to VISmart and then to ITMO University.  As a result, he became a member of the ITMO Fellowship program, joined the team, and is currently working on improving semantic technologies in the field of voice device management. <br><br>  - Olesya Baranyuk, ITMO University Technopark </blockquote><br>  The commercial director of VISmart speaks about this interaction: <br><br><blockquote>  Yes, our developments are connected with ITMO University.  The fact is that our Ontodia product is aimed, among other things, at supporting the standards of semantic web issued by w3c, namely RDF, OWL, SPARQL. <br><br>  In Russia, according to our information, there is only one strong scientific unit that teaches to apply these standards and conducts serious research projects in this area - the ITMO University‚Äôs International Laboratory ‚ÄúIntellectual Information Processing Methods and Semantic Technologies‚Äù with which we have established close relations.  Our two employees are ITMO graduate students. <br><br>  - Dmitry Pavlov, VISmart </blockquote><br>  <b>Joint cases</b> <br><br>  An example of joint work of the ITMO University divisions and the technopark residents is the creation of a model for the provision of the World Cup 2018, which was developed jointly with the Institute of Design and Urban Studies.  The created <a href="http://otslab.ru/ru/2016/11/02/kontseptsiya-transportnogo-obespecheniya-chempionata-mira-po-futbolu-2018-goda-2/">system</a> takes into account the schedule of games, as well as the schedule of traffic, arrival and departure of guests and other factors and serves, in particular, to simulate various situations related to the movement of people during the Championship [we told about other developments of the University for the 2018 World Cup <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/spbifmo/blog/331986/">here</a> ]. <br><br>  <b>Search for colleagues</b> <br><br>  Residents of Technopark are expected to be ready to take on undergraduate and postgraduate students at the University.  Some trainees subsequently become employees of the company - for example, students and graduates of the ITMO University work on the projects odgAssist and Orbi. <br><br>  <b>Use of equipment and laboratories</b> <br><br>  The opportunity not only to consult with scientists, but also to solve with them the practical tasks of innovative companies - another point of contact between the University and the residents of the Technopark: <br><br><blockquote>  The possibility of sharing the equipment of the laboratories of the University or other residents of the Technopark is an option that our residents often use.  They appeal to us with their request, we present them to our colleagues from scientific departments, in case there is a mutual interest in cooperation, joint scientific and business projects are born. <br><br>  - Olesya Baranyuk, ITMO University Technopark </blockquote><br><h4>  What turned out to be particularly useful: the opinion of residents </h4><br>  We decided to find out which features of Technopark turned out to be the most useful for resident projects: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Innovative managers help</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  The following services turned out to be the most useful for us: the opportunity to use the Technopark conference hall, the possibilities of FabLab.  It is convenient and pleasant for us to have premises in the Technopark building, because the authority of ITMO helps to look convincing, especially in the early stages. <br><br>  But the most important thing is the help of innovative managers.  They acquaint us with potential clients, assist in the promotion and popularization of the project, from them you can get help on almost any issue. <br><br>  - Dmitry Pavlov, VISmart </blockquote></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Promotion and infrastructure</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Technopark actively helps to find interesting programs and competitions for startups.  For example, Technopark contributed to our participation in the contest of Polar Bear Pitching projects in Oulu (Finland), where we took the second place.  It was an interesting experience, participation in which gave us the opportunity to become more recognizable in the world, because the event was attended by representatives of the media from all over the world: CNN, BBC, Al Jazeera, etc., many were broadcasting online, because not every day You can see an entrepreneur broadcasting competitive advantages from an ice-hole in February at a temperature of ‚Äì25. <br><br>  It is also very useful for us to be able to communicate with other companies working in the field of 360 videos.  It is very convenient that there is a FabLab in the technopark, where there are many different tools and equipment, which allows, for example, to quickly print prototypes, details, and so on a 3D printer. <br><br>  - Alexander Moreno, Orbi </blockquote></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Support, Networking and PR</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  A lot of cool events for which we are called, cool PR, participation in events, crazy networking, help in interacting with various state tools.  support, traction, good advice, warm words of support. <br><br>  - Oleg Shakhov, odgAssist </blockquote></div></div><br><h4>  Tips for young entrepreneurs: what is important at the start </h4><br>  Olesya Baranyuk advises to move quickly from plans to actions: to shorten less, not to be afraid, to create a team that will share your values.  The important point: to be honest and from the very beginning to value our reputation.  Alexander Pavlov from Parseq Lab adds: do not be afraid of mistakes - it is better to ‚Äústep on a rake‚Äù, but not to lose enthusiasm, than to try to make everything perfect the first time. <br><br><blockquote>  Try to find a client.  Let it be not quite a profile client.  But try to start earning as soon as possible.  At the initial stage, a grant from the Innovation Assistance Foundation helped us <br><br>  - Dmitry Pavlov, VISmart </blockquote><br><blockquote>  The project must perform the tasks for which it is created.  Business must make money.  What you do can make money?  And what can be done to bring more? <br><br>  In any ways (legal) get the first sales.  You must understand what you are doing, for what money, for whom and why (what problem you decide).  If everything is ok, then do a SWOT analysis of your idea / business.  Feel free to pivot and close the project. <br><br>  Didn't take off - see why.  If there is no value - well, it happens.  If there is no speed, focus or execution - work on yourself, it may be too early for you to do a startup.  And do CustDev, a lot of CustDev'a, so that your product was someone needs. <br><br>  - Oleg Shakhov, odgAssist </blockquote><br><blockquote>  I will not give universal advice.  Just give an example of what we faced ourselves.  As a rule, especially when you do not just software, but a device, you have to interact with a large number of partners (factories, manufacturers of processors and other electronic components, and so on). <br><br>  It is very important to establish with them not only business, but also personal relationships.  Despite the fact that now almost everything can be discussed remotely, by mail, on a call and so on, one should not neglect a personal meeting.  Firstly, it helps to solve many issues much faster, and secondly, it makes your partnership more reliable. <br><br>  - Alexander Moreno, Orbi </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/338714/">https://habr.com/ru/post/338714/</a></p>
