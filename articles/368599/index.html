And demand, as you know, creates supply. <br><br><h5>  <b>New initiatives from Aeroseal, Air Innovations and Chatsworth Products</b> </h5><br>  <b><i>Air Innovations</i></b> <br>  This year, Air Innovations has expanded the range of air conditioning systems for the data center, presenting a product called VPACK Specialty HVAC.  Due to the fact that such a system is vertical, it is optimally suited for indoor placement where the horizontal space is limited.  It is ideal for installation in narrow spaces where compactness is required. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Two versions are available for buyers: with a cooling capacity of 1.7 and 3.5 kW, respectively.  Both versions offer a remote user control interface, built-in air humidification modules and the ability to organize water cooling. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5e3/282/c03/5e3282c03d6c4c53bc66ce9879705640.png">  . <br>  The novelty is suitable for deployment not only in small server rooms and more spacious machine rooms of full-fledged data centers, but also inside warehouses and other commercial properties.

      <b><i>Chatsworth Products (CPI)</i></b> <br>  The holding company, the largest manufacturer of electronic devices for the communications and energy industries in the United States.  Among its products offered are various infrastructure solutions for data centers.  CPI reported an increased demand for the company's product portfolio from designers and builders of server farms, which are aimed at achieving maximum energy efficiency of the infrastructure while reducing the negative impact of the data center on the environment. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31d/cdf/98f/31dcdf98fcba4b83942bb43d846d4c0a.jpg"><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zPvzulS4Kow%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiaNY1E3rYyEh0wOSTUSbqhi2zINA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Products of the Passive Cooling Solutions family have become especially popular.  This family includes sub-lines Aisle Containment Solution (solutions for insulation of air ducts inside the data center) and F-Series TeraFrame Cabinets (mounting racks with an advanced air flow system designed to accommodate server equipment). <br>  Chatsworth Products representatives are assured that these solutions help to achieve lower operating costs and significantly reduce the PUE ratio. <br>  Chatsworth Products has offices in the United States of America, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, the United Arab Emirates and China.  Its production facilities are dispersed throughout the United States, Europe and Asia. <br><br>  <b><i>New insulation system for the outer shell of the data center building from Aeroseal</i></b> <br>  Aeroseal is becoming increasingly popular.  In 2011, she got into the prestigious rating, which is compiled annually by This Old House, ‚Äú100 Best House Products - 2011‚Äù thanks to an exclusive technology.  The new technology was developed by the energy department of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory during the implementation of the Indoor Environment Program environmental program.  The new ‚Äúgreen‚Äù technology from Aeroseal consisted in spraying a special sealing ‚Äúmist‚Äù, which seemed to seal all cracks and holes up to one and a half centimeters wide.  According to estimates of the company's specialists, the savings on heating and cooling using such a technology of "mist" injected into the ventilation pipes, in general, would be up to $ 5 billion a year. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98f/f74/35e/98ff7435e6f14cc6b9f2c3827644b594.jpg"><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DnkbvkkZCr8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjzqZPCIonWDiTkGx0YAGbL8Yjt1g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Aerosol-sealant does not cover the inner surface of pipes with a continuous layer, but finds damage in them and seals them.  Disperse sealant consisting of two parts - copolymer vinyl acetate and diethylhexanol, forms a strong film, while cleaning the inner surfaces is not required.  All work takes from 2 to 8 hours, and the effect will be no less than when using fully intelligent wind turbines. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3cb/054/79b/3cb05479b6ae4f4c8a8383876352beab.jpg"><br><br>  At the Aeroseal Exhibition and Conference Success Summit 2015, Aeroseal presented a new insulation system for the outer shell of various residential and commercial buildings, including data centers.  The system is automated and is designed to efficiently search and seal building construction areas through which cold or hot air leaks.  The new sealing system was prepared with the participation of a team of engineers led by Mark Modera, a professor at the University of California, Davis (USA). <br>  Such a system based on a patented technology uses compressed nitrogen to inject sealant into areas requiring sealing.  The sealant can quickly eliminate any cracks, minimizing the intensity of air leakage through the outer shell of the data center building.  Sealant particles are sprayed around the holes until the leak is completely eliminated.  This product is expected to enter the market as early as 2016. <br>  From the words of Mark Modery: <br><blockquote>  The new insulation system has the potential to significantly improve the energy efficiency of the infrastructure. Full sealing of a building with an area of ‚Äã‚Äãabout 120 square meters takes about one hour. </blockquote><br>  At the same exhibition, Aeroseal Success Summit 2015, the company presented the Mobile Pro airtight sealing system designed to speed up and simplify such work.  According to Aeroseal, Mobile Pro can increase the speed of airtightness work by 30 percent or more, saving time and increasing profitability. <br><br>  The need for cooling of the data center scale will fundamentally change the cooling market over the next 5-10 years. <br>  According to a new study by the analytical company BSRIA, the use of traditional air conditioners in computer rooms is expected to drop sharply, since data centers choose a combination of natural cooling, liquid cooling and cooling with cold water. <br>  Hyper-scale data centers such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon AWS and Yahoo!  Ready to apply "new" technologies, such as modular cooling and external central air conditioning / evaporative cooling.  According to BSRIA, data centers are generally developing rapidly, and the standard design that has been spread over the past two decades is inferior to more flexible configurations that are more in tune with the complex needs of more demanding and informed customers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368599/</a></p>
