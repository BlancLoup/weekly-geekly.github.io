      In this article, we will look at the present and future of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat will allow developers to become key players in the IT services market and make the digital world more reliable and meaningful. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  3 programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãrequired to learn </h4><br><h3>  1. Python </h3><br>  Python is not a new language.  It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991.  Currently, with the development of artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics, development based on algorithms, suddenly exciting world attention, he has become the favorite of most programmers. <br><br>  Business owners who want to scale and grow, are increasingly paying attention to automation, and therefore the demand for IT services is growing. <br><br>  Python is becoming extremely relevant for all developers to learn and grow.  This is a real favorite among beginners and even experienced developers due to its simple syntax and usage. <br><br>  <i>Python application:</i> <br><br>  <b>Data analytics</b> <br><br>  When it comes to data science, statistics, analytics, ML, Python is one of the most appropriate languages.  Yes, it competes with R. R is a statistical programming language.  If you are interested, study R. <br><cut></cut><br>  Python is a general-purpose programming language and is not only used for statistical programming, but also well suited for creating games, websites, business applications, and more. <br><br>  <b>Web development</b> <br><br>  Python is well suited for developing web applications without too much difficulty.  It comes with a rich set of libraries and Internet protocols, such as: <br>  <i>Requests</i> - client HTTP library <br>  <i>BeautifulSoup</i> - HTML parser <br>  <i>Feedparser</i> - parsing RSS / Atom feeds <br>  <i>Paramiko</i> - to implement the protocol SSH2 <br>  <i>Twisted Python</i> - event-oriented framework (for asynchronous network programming) <br><br>  There are also such strong frameworks as <b>Django</b> , <b>Pyramid,</b> and microframes flask and bottle that allow you to program faster. <br><br>  You can write CGI scripts, you also have the ability to manage content using systems such as Plone and Django CMS in Python. <br><br>  Development in Python is a great option for beginners and for those who want to change the programming language. <br><br>  <b>Science and Numeric application</b> <br><br>  Python is the darling of many experts on analytical data because of the collection of libraries intended for statistical and numerical analysis: <br><cut></cut><br>  <i>SciPy</i> is a collection of packages for mathematics, science and engineering. <br>  <i>Pandas</i> is a library for processing and analyzing data. <br>  <i>IPython</i> is an interactive shell that provides advanced introspection, additional command syntax, code highlighting, and automatic addition. <br>  <i>NumPy</i> ‚Äî Provides general mathematical and numerical operations in the form of pre-compiled, fast functions. <br><br>  <b>Educational sector</b> <br><br>  Python is taught in most colleges and universities because it is easy to understand. <br><br>  <b>ERP Development</b> <br><br>  Python is suitable for developing software for solving enterprise-level business problems.  There are already many popular ERPs, such as Odoo &amp; Tryton, with which you can effectively manage enterprise resources. <br><br>  <b>Game development</b> <br><br>  Yes, you can develop games in python, although it is most preferable to use Unity, python has PyGame, the PyKyra framework.  You also get a lot of 3D rendering libraries for developing 3D games. <br><br>  Databases, networking, programming, robotics, web scrapping, AI, ML are what makes Python so popular to learn in 2019. <br><cut></cut><br><h3>  2. Javascript </h3><br>  This is a strong contender for Python, and the main reason for this is its lightness and ability to support full stack and mobile development. <br><br>  All thanks to the popularity of the NodeJs &amp; MEAN technology stack.  Large technology companies are developing their product using javascript and actively use this stack. <br><br>  Using JavaScript, you can create web applications, server applications, desktop and mobile applications. <br><br>  <b>Development of the server side:</b> <br><br>  NodeJS is a gift for many developers.  This is a strong foundation for all JS programmers.  NodeJS helps create both desktop and server applications in JavaScript, without the need for a browser. <br><br>  <b>Mobile development:</b> <br><br>  The demand for mobile apps is growing at a fast pace, and as a result, many cross-platform frameworks are becoming popular, reducing development time and cost.  AngularJs, React Native, is used to create cool mobile solutions. <br><br>  React Native has become very popular among mobile application developers who want to implement cross-platform mobile development without learning Native Development using Android and iOS. <br><cut></cut><br>  <b>Blazing Fast JavaScript engines:</b> <br><br>  All popular browser developers: Mozilla, Google, and Apple are competing to create the fastest JavaScript interpreters inside browsers so that the browser can mimic an environment similar to its own applications.  They compete to provide web applications with additional features, high speed and greater performance that come with native mobile applications. <br><br>  Javascript enhances the creation of your own application in the browser and makes life easier for web developers. <br><br>  JS frameworks you need to know <br><cut></cut><br>  Consider some of the popular JS frameworks. <br><br>  <b>AngularJS</b> <br><br>  This open source JS framework was released in 2010.  Allows you to create stable, secure and innovative mobile and web applications in less time. <br><br>  This gives a whole new life to HTML code when HTML attributes are mixed with Angular directives.  In addition, it is understandable and easy to deploy. <br><br>  <b>ReactJS</b> <br><br>  React.js - a library from Facebook and Instagram, allows you to develop scalable applications that meet all modern requirements that are changing so quickly. <br><br>  ReactJS is reliable and stable.  Simple interface design and implementation of a virtual DOM are key reasons for its popularity. <br><br>  <b>Vue.js</b> <br><cut></cut><br>  One of the simplest frameworks that even a beginner in programming should know.  It is based on ReactJS, AngularJS and Knockout.js to create an ecosystem that is productive in every way. <br><br>  <b>Meteor.js</b> <br><br>  Meteor.js is an open source JavaScript framework.  It is a comprehensive framework, extremely stable and uses pure JavaScript to create a scalable website, as well as mobile applications.  It provides many resources, tutorials and packages that simplify the process of developing a website or mobile application. <br><br>  <b>Backbone.js</b> <br><br>  Jeremy Ashkenas was released in 2010 under the MIT license.  It gives structure to web applications with the help of models with bindings by key and user events, collections with a rich set of methods with enumerated entities, representations with declarative event handling;  and connects it all to your existing REST JSON API.  Pinterest, Delicious, Disqus, Walmart and Foursquare use it extensively. <br><br>  <b>Polymer.js</b> <br><br>  Google released this JS framework in 2013 with the goal of extending the capabilities of HTML through web components.  This gives developers the ability to structure custom HTML elements based on browser technologies.  The reason for the growth of its popularity is the ability to introduce a modern and innovative approach to the development of web technologies. <br><br><h3>  3. Go programming language </h3><br>  Go is an open source programming language that simplifies the creation of simple, reliable, and efficient software. <br><br>  Go was conceived in 2007 and officially released in 2012 and was adopted by Google to improve programming performance in the era of multi-core processors, computer networks and large code bases. <br><br>  <i>Go benefits:</i> <br><cut></cut><br>  - Static typing and efficiency (as in C ++ or Java) <br>  - Performance and ease of use (as in Python or JavaScript) <br>  - High performance network and multiprocessing <br><br>  Thus, it includes all the ease of Python and the effectiveness of C ++ and Java to help create scalable applications. <br>  Go is gradually becoming one of the most promising languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat needs to be learned and applied in the future. <br><br>  <i>Why go?</i> <br><br>  The popularity of using Go is explained by the fact that it is an easy open source language, suitable for modern architectures.  The Google Docker and Kubernetes package are built using Go.  Go is also gaining momentum in data science. <br><br>  Data for 2018: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/81d/cd1/5a8/81dcd15a89bd895c482553ff43175041.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The choice of programming language depends entirely on the purpose of use and the degree of ease of understanding.  You should feel confident and comfortable.  Make your choice based on your needs, research and market demand. <br><br>  I see a great future for javascript and Go.  If you need to penetrate data mining, then learn Python.  If you plan to engage in mobile development, learn javascript. <br><br>  Grow in one direction and become the best in your business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431654/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431654/</a></p>
