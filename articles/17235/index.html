It is also clear that other parties concerned <br>  this platform should have at least some commercial interest in this model. <br>  Let's look at this business from the user of the future platform. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Google Ads. </h3>  The Google model is actually built on revenue generation from services provided to anyone. <br>  to the user for free, that is, by cramming advertising into content.  As seen on the preview, the application <br>  GMail, GTalk, Google Maps pre-installed in it, and rather integrated into it, <br>  are essentially the transfer of existing web services in Google.  And that means maybe <br>  they bring along with themselves and contextual advertising, as a way to get Google devidentov. <br>  Moreover, the results of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/telecom/31826.html">famous radio frequency auction in the United States</a> will have the most direct influence on the appearance of this advertisement <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/telecom/31826.html">.</a>

    <h3>  Traffic </h3>  It is clear that web applications are the load on the channel as well as on the user's pocket. <br>  (Unlimited 3G tariffs are not available for us for a very long time).  And this will be infinite <br>  for the sake of operators, and on what they will be able to build their marketing companies by <br>  selling Android phones and, most likely, unlimited data plans for them. <br><h3>  Open-source license. </h3>  About the fact that Android is using a GPL-licensed Linux kernel will be delivered under <br>  Another, less rigid open-source license has written a lot.  There were also opinions that <br>  we don‚Äôt see the whole Android source code in the near future, and if we see, then <br>  Only that part which Google will consider safe for itself and the partners. <br><br><h3>  Operators and manufacturers. </h3>  Having disowned the GPL, Google provides its partners with protection from the obligation to open their code that will work on a new platform, which on the one hand opens up this market for commercial applications.  But on the other hand, it opens up the possibility for beneficiaries to block, by software or hardware, any user attempts to modify or replace the supplied platform.  How and who will be this prospect is not yet clear, but no one wants to miss the extra profit. <br><br><h3>  Privacy </h3>  Despite the various slogans about the security of user data, and even the corresponding item in the Android SDK license, in order to use mail on the ‚Äúbare‚Äù phone you will have to create a GMail account.  Not only is the Google Location API advertised and the corresponding P2P applications, as it turns out, will work through Google servers and, again, only if you have an account.  Well, it follows that certain persons, legally or not, will be able to get not only the content of your correspondence, but also information about your movements in the past or even on-line. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3>  Despite the pretense of open-source platform claims, it may well be <br>  that an ordinary user can only see an absolutely identical iPhone solution, <br>  which, in addition to the actual price of the hardware device, will force it to spend substantial sums on <br>  proper use of its expanded functionality, including also viewing of advertisements, and the need to register a Google account for using this functionality. <br><br><h3>  Bright future </h3>  And yet I would like to hope that Android will snare for users of that open platform, which we lack so much, if not through the efforts of Google, then the efforts of third-party developers.  Moments of truth: <br><ul><li>  Google will publish the Android source code and allow it to be modified completely. </li><li>  A major player in the market (for example, HTC) will be released into the free sale of an affordable device that allows the user to completely modify the platform and install any applications there. </li><li>  A utility will be released allowing control of data connection and traffic. </li><li>  A free office application package will be released. </li><li>  A mail agent will be released, which is a complete application.  (Opera Mail?). </li><li>  An application capable of loading Google maps from the built-in memory will be released instead of using access to the server. </li><li>  Any third-party browser capable of being replaced and embedded as the original one (Opera?) Will be released. </li><li>  An open distributed P2P network will be launched to exchange subscriber location data. </li><li>  Google will not be able to buy Skype, or Skype client will be released allowing you to encrypt the transmitted data. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17235/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17235/</a></p>
