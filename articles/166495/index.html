      In our blog, we will talk about many little things related to the development and promotion of children's educational applications, as well as happy to answer any of your questions based on our one and a half year experience. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Creating a child-focused application is not an easy task.  You need to be able to think like children, to see an iPhone or iPad through the eyes of a child.  We cannot take children into our team, so we invited children‚Äôs development specialists - teachers and psychologists who help us.  And besides, our products are constantly being tested by children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b6/7e9/fd2/1b67e9fd21af56be9fff5e21d5f16fa0.jpg"><br><br>  We will be very happy if you support our initiative, as now many are interested in developing software products for children. <br><br>  Little Beetle experienced a rather turbulent history of the company's formation, a large-scale rebranding, which brought many changes in our life and work.  Each application was updated and improved; we were forced to abandon some already-made applications due to their inconsistencies with new standards (Space Tube, ‚ÄúGreat Inventions‚Äù, ‚ÄúHercules Feats‚Äù). <br><br>  Many developers are starting to develop games from the very beginning, so why did we decide to stop at the ‚ÄúEducation‚Äù section, and not at the games?  There are several reasons for this: first, many young developers forget that the ‚ÄúGames‚Äù section is not only the most popular and profitable, but also the most competitive.  It takes much more effort and money to get the application in the TOP.  Secondly, on average, the ‚Äúlifespan‚Äù of an educational application is higher than that of a gaming application.  And the third: since many of the guys from our team are young parents, we decided to finally focus on children's educational applications.  Of course, we should not forget that educational applications also have their own features and negative aspects, but we will tell you about this later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/09e/ac5/a46/09eac5a46129815b0982202d34798b23.jpg"><br><br>  Three of our most popular applications are presented on the right side in the form of a widget (thanks to Habr√© for the functionality provided).  On our <a href="http://littlebeetle.net/ru">official website</a> is a list of all our applications, if someone is interested come in, we will always be happy. <br><br>  In early March, scheduled to release the next children's application called <i>"The Adventures of Pirates"</i> (the name has not yet been approved).  Below are a few images for a brief introduction. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e68/89e/8c9/e6889e8c978fcecaebffa53158efd057.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b27/828/86e/b2782886e01d51c058b9a2be2709a681.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f7b/9cf/412/f7b9cf412df7c1233d04352ee0f8f799.jpg"><br><br>  We really want to hear your feedback, suggestions and comments.  We are also ready to answer any of your questions and highlight them in individual posts of this blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166495/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166495/</a></p>
