      In this post, I will summarize the distribution of our servers with a photo report, talk about the incredible new distribution of blade servers (!) And plans for the future. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Let's start with the end.  With plans for the future. </h4><br><br>  Neither I, nor my colleagues could imagine that there is such a demand for equipment.  And in 95% they are not seekers of freebies, but real enthusiasts, people who work for the idea, do everything possible to solve pressing problems.  It does not matter whether they work on their project, work in a rural school or in a research institute.  They all do important things and are very limited in resources. <br><br>  We have distributed two dozen servers, that's great.  <b>But this is a drop in the ocean.</b>  This is just nothing, zero.  The real need for equipment is hundreds, if not thousands of times more.  Many applications were rejected by us because people do not even need a powerful industrial server; a simple computer of the last generation would be enough for solving problems.  They also need help. <br><br>  I am sure that there are many companies that have old servers and computers gather dust and will never be used. <br><br>  I am sure that there are a lot of people like you and me, like many of our friends and acquaintances who have an old computer in a closet waiting for their time to go to the garbage. <br><br>  I am sure that in all, even the most remote corners of the country, there will be those who can give the old iron and those who really need it for business. <br><br>  <b>My colleagues and I decided to unite and launch the ORANGEMAN initiative.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Let's give your old iron a new life!</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Join us!</b> <br><br><h4>  <s>Orange dude</s> -&gt; Orangeman </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18c/6bc/15d/18c6bc15d2179f58f714c3a2c8f765b0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Orangeman now has a logo, two communities: <a href="http://vk.com/orangeman.russia">VK</a> and <a href="http://www.facebook.com/Orangeman.Russia">Facebook</a> and even a mailing list ( <a href="http://rusonyx.activehosted.com/form/1103">you can subscribe to updates here</a> ). <br><br>  It was almost an impossible task to sort out thousands of applications for servers through mail.  Therefore, we consulted and figured out how we can build work more efficiently so that we can attract a much larger number of hands and participants. <br><br>  I am waiting for letters from anyone who is willing to share equipment on <a href="">orangeman@rusonyx.ru</a> .  Information about your distributions will be laid out in these communities.  In the comments for each hand can and should apply for the receipt.  The distributor himself decides to whom he considers it necessary to give his iron. <br><br>  Periodically, a post with the results of distributions and photo reports from Orangeman activists will be published on Habr√©. <br><br>  <b>Join now!</b>  <b>Without you, nothing happens!</b> <br><br><h4>  I present to you the first Orangeman activists - SKB Kontur </h4><br><br>  Before writing this post, I spoke with our partners and friendly companies.  I was looking for those who support us and will hold the next distribution of servers. <br>  The first responded friends from <a href="http://kontur.ru/">SKB Kontur</a> .  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/skbkontur/profile/">Company profile on Habr√©</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e20/2ff/219/e202ff21915ac7de5ed1f6edc74f7468.png" alt="image"><br>  SKB Kontur has been a federal software developer since 1988.  The company employs more than 2,000 professionals who are able to find practical solutions to the most complex tasks.  That is why every fourth company in the country uses software products SKB Kontur. <br><br>  The guys from the circuit want to give in good hands ... (drum roll) <br><br><h5>  1.

Height 17U, rack depth 1 m. <br>  Power supplies are designed for 7.5 kW, but according to the experience of using 3 kW enough.  This server, along with the blades from the first point in the peak, never consumed more than 6 kW for two. <br>  The equipment is in _Moscow_. <br><br>  Please leave applications in the comments to this post or in our groups: <a href="http://vk.com/orangeman.russia%3Fw%3Dwall-55800696_5">VK</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D502851369785491%26set%3Da.502850706452224.1073741827.502840016453293%26type%3D1">Facebook</a> . <br><br>  <b>I really hope that these glands will be worthy of use!</b>  <b>Please tell your friends about this distribution so that the information reaches people who need more computing power.</b> <br><br>  Many thanks to our friends SKB Kontur for the decision to support Orangeman!  This is a good example for all of us. <br><br><h4>  And for dessert - a photo report on the results of the distribution of servers. </h4><br><br>  Here you see: the number of votes, the new owner of the server and the serial number in the vote. <br><br>  357 - Sechenov Academy Clinic of Obstetrics and Gynecology.
