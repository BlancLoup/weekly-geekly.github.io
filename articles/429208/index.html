      The above scheme partially solves the problem of “remote boot to a flash drive”, allows you to enjoy encrypted Windows / Linux and exchange data via an “encrypted channel” from one OS to another. <br><br>  <b>PC boot order:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  turning on the machine; </li><li>  boot loader VeraCrypt <i>(correct password will continue loading Windows 7)</i> ; </li><li>  pressing the “Esc” key will load the GRUB2 bootloader; </li><li>  GRUB2 boot loader <i>(choice of distribution / GNU / Linux / CLI)</i> , requires authentication of the GRUB2-superuser &lt;login / password&gt;; </li><li>  after successful authentication and distribution selection, you will need to enter a password phrase to unlock "/boot/initrd.img"; </li><li>  after entering error-free passwords in GRUB2, you will need to enter a password <i>(third password, BIOS password or GNU / Linux user account password</i> to unlock <i>)</i> and unlock the GNU / Linux OS, or automatically substitute the secret key <i>(two passwords + key)</i> ; </li><li>  external invasion of the GRUB2 configuration will freeze the GNU / Linux boot process. </li></ul><br>  When partitioning a hard disk <i>(MBR table), a</i> PC can have no more than 4 main partitions, or 3 main and one extended partitions, as well as an unlabeled area.  An extended partition, unlike the main one, can contain subsections <i>(logical drives = extended partition)</i> .  In other words, the “extended partition” on the HDD replaces LVM for the current task: full system encryption.  If your disk is mapped to 4 main partitions, you need to use lvm, either transform <i>(with formatting) the</i> section from main to extended, or competently use all four sections and leave everything as it is, getting the desired result.  Even if you have one partition on the disk, Gparted will help to split the HDD <i>(into additional sections)</i> without losing data, but still with a small price to pay for such actions. <br><br>  The layout of the hard disk, for which the verbalization of the entire article will go, is presented in the table below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jd/3k/wf/jd3kwfqr9mas6ldlmil_5qwwbg8.png"><br>  <i>Table (№ 1) sections 1Tb.</i> <br><br>  Something similar should be with you. <br>  Sda1 - the main section number 1 NTFS <i>(encrypted)</i> ; <br>  sda2 - extended marker section; <br>  sda6 - logical drive <i>(GRUB2 boot loader is installed on it);</i> <br>  sda8 - swap (encrypted paging file); <br>  sda9 - test logical drive; <br>  sda5 - logical disk for the curious; <br>  sda7 - GNU / Linux OS (transferred OS to an encrypted logical drive); <br>  sda3 - the main section number 2 with Windows 7 <i>(encrypted)</i> ; <br>  sda4 - the main section number 3 <i>(it was located unencrypted GNU / Linux, used for backup)</i> . <br><br><h3>  [A] Block system encryption Windows 7 </h3><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A1.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Veracrypt</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-q/in/7s/-qin7s3t7xacdjov7invu_8kb2y.png"><br><br>  Downloading from the <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html">official site</a> , or from the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/veracrypt/">sourceforge</a> mirror, the installation version of the VeraCrypt cryptographic software <i>(at the time of publishing the article v1.23, the portable version of VeraCrypt is not suitable for system encryption)</i> .

If you have an out of date CPU, then the Twofish encryption algorithm is likely to be the fastest.  If the CPU is powerful, note the difference: AES - encryption on the test results will be several times faster than its crypto competitors.  AES is a popular encryption algorithm, the hardware of modern CPUs is specially optimized for the “secret” <s>and for “hacking</s> ”. <br><br>  VeraCrypt supports the ability to encrypt disks in a cascade of AES <i>(Twofish)</i> / and other combinations.  On a 2-core Intel 2.20GHz CPU a decade ago <i>(without hardware support for AES, A / T cascade encryption),</i> performance degradation is almost imperceptible.  <i>(AMD CPU of the same era / ~ parameters — performance is slightly reduced)</i> .  The OS works in dynamics and the consumption of resources for transparent encryption is imperceptible.  Unlike, for example, a noticeable decrease in performance due to the installed test unstable desktop environment Mate v1.20.1 <i>(or v1.20.2 I do not remember exactly)</i> in GNU / Linux, or because of the work of the telemetry subroutine in Windows7.  Usually sophisticated users perform hardware performance tests before encryption.  For example, in Aida64 / Sysbench / systemd-analyze and compared with the results of the same tests after the system is encrypted, thereby refuting the myth for itself, "system encryption is harmful."  The slowdown of the machine and the inconvenience are noticeable when backing up / restoring encrypted data, because the “system backup data” operation itself is not measured in ms, and those &lt;decrypt / encrypt on the fly&gt; are added.  In the end, each user chooses an encryption algorithm regarding the satisfaction of the tasks set and the degree of his paranoia. <br><br>  It is better to leave the PIM parameter by default so that when booting the OS each time you do not enter exact iteration values.  VeraCrypt uses a huge number of iterations to create a truly “slow hash”.  An attack on such a “cryptulite” by the Brute force method / rainbow tables makes sense only with a <s>short</s> “simple” passphrase and a personal charset-list of the victim.  Paying for password strength is a delay in correctly entering a password when booting the OS <i>(mounting VeraCrypt volumes in GNU / Linux is much faster).</i> <br>  Free software for implementing brute force attacks <i>(extracting a passphrase from the header of a VeraCrypt / LUKS drive)</i> Hashcat and John the Ripper, the latter does not know how to work with Twofish for example. <br><br>  Due to the cryptographic strength of the encryption algorithms, unstoppable crypto-punkers are developing software with a different attack vector.  For example, extracting metadata / keys from RAM <i>(cold boot attack / DMA),</i> there is specialized free and non-free software for this purpose. <br><br>  Upon completion of setting / generating “unique metadata” of the encrypted active partition, VeraCrypt will offer to restart the PC and test the performance of its bootloader.  After reboot a / start Windows, VeraCrypt will load in standby mode, it remains only to confirm the encryption process - Y. <br><br>  At the final step of system encryption, VeraCrypt will offer to create a backup copy of the header of the active encrypted partition in the form of “veracrypt rescue disk.iso” - it is necessary to make - <u>in this software such an operation is a requirement</u> <i>(in LUKS, the requirement is unfortunately omitted but underlined in the documentation)</i> .  Rescue disk is useful to all, and to someone, and not once.  The loss <i>(header / MBR rewrite) of the header</i> backup will permanently deny access to the decrypted partition from the Windows OS. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A4.</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Creating a rescue disk VeraCrypt</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  By default, VeraCrypt offers to burn “metadata ~ 2-3MB” on a CD, but not all people have disks or DWD-ROM drives, and creating a bootable “VeraCrypt Rescue disk” flash drive for someone will be a technical surprise: Rufus / GUIdd-ROSA ImageWriter and other similar software will not be able to cope with the task, because in addition to copying the displaced metadata to the bootable flash drive, you need to copy / paste from the image outside the file system of the USB drive, in short, correctly copy the MBR / road to trinket.  Under the GNU / Linux OS, you can create a bootable flash drive using the dd utility, looking at this table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_z/zl/f-/_zzlf-zhvflotagy215jpqv9dkw.jpeg"><br><br>  Creating a rescue disk in the Windows environment - otherwise.  The developer VeraCrypt did not include the solution to this problem in the official <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/VeraCrypt%2520Rescue%2520Disk.html">documentation</a> on the "rescue disk", but suggested a solution in another way: he put additional software to create the "usb rescue disk" in free access on his forum VeraCrypt.  The archivist of this software for Windows is “ <a href="http://vk.cc/8BOfoV">creating a usb veracrypt rescue disk</a> ”.  After saving the rescue disk.iso, the block system encryption process of the active partition will begin.  During encryption, the OS does not stop, no restart of the PC is required.  Upon completion of the encryption operation, the active partition becomes fully encrypted, you can use it.  If the VeraCrypt loader does not appear when the PC starts up, and the header recovery operation does not help, then check the “boot” flag, it should be installed on the partition where Windows is present <i>(regardless of encryption and other OS, see table 1).</i> <br>  <i><b>This completes the description of block system encryption with Windows OS.</b></i> <br></div></div><br><h3>  [B] LUKS.
