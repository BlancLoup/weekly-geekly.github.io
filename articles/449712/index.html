As it turned out, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/448824/">demand is gradually decreasing</a> , most likely the reason for the popularization of solid-state drives in the consumer segment.

      The total sales of hard drives in Q1 of this year reached 76.6‚Äì77.8 million devices worldwide.  For the quarter, the fall in demand was 12.9%, for the year it is about 18.3%.  Sales of 3.5-inch HDD fell by 4 million in quantitative terms compared to Q1 of last year.  Sales of 2.5 inch disks fell even more - by 6 million units a year. <br><br><h3>  Laser thermonuclear facility installed in Sarov </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/528/fe5/455/528fe54555d78f117105c4f13f732589.jpg"><br><br>  Last week, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/448850/">the final stage of installation of a laser fusion device</a> was <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/448850/">completed</a> in Sarov.  With its help, they plan to conduct experiments on controlled inertial thermonuclear fusion.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating such an installation was first proposed in the 1950s by academicians Andrei Sakharov and Igor Tamm. <br><br>  This setup works as follows: the spherical capsule is filled with a mixture of deuterium and tritium, then a powerful laser pulse is sent to the surface.  Under the action of a pulse, a part of the capsule turns into steam, an <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">ablation pressure</a> is created, which accelerates the spherical piston to very high speeds.  Next, the mixture is symmetrically compressed to the parameters necessary for the thermonuclear reaction. <br><br><h3>  The Federation Council approved the law on the "sovereign Internet" </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8b/d43/105/a8bd43105ac7f2c45ecc97184fb7685d.jpg"><br><br>  The ‚ÄúSovereign Internet Act‚Äù was <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/449018/">approved by the Federation Council</a> .  The authors of the draft law position it as a tool that allows for the stable operation of the Russian-speaking network segment in the event of aggressive actions from abroad.  The last stage is the signing of the document by the president, after which the law enters into force in November of the current year. <br><br>  True, in order for the law to start working, you need to create clear rules for routing traffic to minimize the transfer of data from Russian users abroad.  In addition, it is required to establish cross-border communication lines and traffic exchange points. <br><br><h3>  Samsung postponed the start of sales of the smartphone Galaxy Fold </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f2/2f0/ee4/3f22f0ee489ca791e3fa800f1231ed5a.jpg"><br><br>  The South Korean corporation Samsung <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/449226/">announced the postponement of the start of sales of the newest smartphone Galaxy Fold with a folding screen</a> .  The reason - the discovery of a large number of problems with the display itself, in some cases, it stops working normally after a couple of days. <br><br>  The reason is the lack of protection against dust penetration under the protective film in the place where the screen is folded.  In addition, the company did not warn that the film should not be removed from the screen, it performs a protective function, if you try to remove it by applying force, you can damage the display. <br><br><h3>  Russian companies will be banned from working with foreign databases </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/67e/f9b/06f/67ef9b06f9e2322fd61b1f8cc1f9addb.jpg"><br><br>  According to the law ‚ÄúOn Sovereign Runet‚Äù, <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/449470/">domestic state-owned companies cannot work with foreign databases</a> .  This may have a negative impact on the work of Rostelecom and other technological companies from the Russian Federation. <br><br>  For example, Rostelecom uses the RIPE DB database to support Runet‚Äôs work.  According to Alexei Semeniak, Director of External Relations in Eastern Europe and Central Asia at RIPE NCC, this database ‚Äúis the source of primary information about the distribution of network addresses and routing rules on the Internet for the whole world.‚Äù  If the base is closed, then Rostelecom will not be able to receive data on changes made by foreign partners, and those, in turn, will not be able to update information about the actions of the Russian company. <br><br>  Similarly, Russian Railways will not be able to receive information about tickets of international railway carriers. <br><br>  At present, the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446806/">law</a> itself <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446806/">‚ÄúOn Sovereign Runet‚Äù</a> , which was recently approved by the Federation Council, is a set of general rules.  They refer to regulatory legal acts that are not yet available.  Therefore, it is difficult to make any predictions for the near future.  Everything will depend on what these acts will be. <br><br><h3>  5G equipment is planned to be produced in the Russian Federation </h3><br>  Today it became known that the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/news/t/449592/">Ministry of Industry and Trade has developed a draft target program ‚ÄúDevelopment of the production of industrial products of the fifth generation networks and the Internet of things in the Russian Federation for 2019‚Äì2024‚Äù</a> .  This program includes a list of hardware and software for 5G and IoT networks. <br><br>  The program budget in the amount of 28 billion rubles will be mastered by the state corporation Rostec and the Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech).  Part of the funds will be received by companies whose products are included in the register of telecommunications equipment produced in Russia, among them NPP Poligon, RDP.RU, Elteks, NPF Micran, T8, etc. <br><br>  In this case, all developments will be conducted using the Russian cryptographic system, including SIM-cards and mobile devices of subscribers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449712/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449712/</a></p>
