    <h5>  <font color="#ff3f5f">1. Take a break</font> </h5><br>  A very good way to start generating ideas when you have already overstrained your brain is to get distracted.  Just switch your attention (or all at once, if you brainstorm together), talk about something else, stop for tea / coffee.  You yourself will be surprised at how from the conversations you will return again to the necessary ‚Äúproduction‚Äù channel. <br><br><br><h5>  <font color="#ff3f5f">2. Start asking questions</font> </h5><br>  If after the return after the break everything was sadly silent or you were distracted, and then again saw an empty white sheet and fell into a stupor, then you should start asking yourself questions.  What for?  How?  Why?  Where was it?  Questions are great stimulate, because you subconsciously will ask questions to which you have some answers.  Recall how experts answer in ‚ÄúWhat?  Where?  When?".  Yes, they are just throwing ideas.  And it works. <br><br><br><h5>  <font color="#ff3f5f">3. Write.</font>  <font color="#ff3f5f">Just write!</font> </h5><br>  Questions also did not help?  Are you still alone in front of a white sheet of paper and drank 5 cups of coffee?  Start thinking about the problem and write, just write everything down.  Slovost your flow.  It can also direct you back on track.  Colleagues can also offer to disperse and begin to record all your thoughts on any account. <br><br><br><h5>  <font color="#ff3f5f">// MISTAKE,</font> </h5><br>  which you can allow here is that you are afraid to feel stupid in the eyes of others.  Do not worry - the most daring ideas are always quite naive and therefore interesting. <br><br><br><h5>  <font color="#ff3f5f">4. Change the situation</font> </h5><br>  At all.  The working day has probably come to an end while you were there and trying to think of something.  Take a walk, take a shower (this, of course, is always the place where ideas themselves find you).  Have a bite and sleep (hello to Mendeleev - suddenly you will have something brilliant) In the end, sometimes you just need to stop thinking about something if ideas don‚Äôt want to occur to you. <br><br><br><h5>  <font color="#ff3f5f">5. Watch</font> </h5><br>  Everything that happens around you can be a source of inspiration.  People who huddle in the subway, people running somewhere - everything!  Therefore, observation is considered one of the most simple and correct ways to search for new ideas.  It is impossible to invent a new product if you do not see the situation in which it may be applicable.  Well, you understand.  So just look for new ideas in people, gestures and movements. <br><br><br><h5>  <font color="#ff3f5f">6. Imagine the result</font> </h5><br>  If your brain still refuses to reproduce at least something valuable, then it's time to transfer yourself to the moment when the idea is already implemented, everyone likes it and everyone is happy.  Try to imagine it.  See you  Try now to build this track from A to B. <br><br><br><h5>  <font color="#ff3f5f">7. Take your initial sketches.</font> </h5><br>  Surely those were when you just started to think something.  Try to develop them and try to solve the existing problem is not perfect, but just consistently.  Perhaps here, too, something will be found. <br><br><br><h5>  <font color="#ff3f5f">// MISTAKE,</font> </h5><br>  which you will surely do here.  Do not dare to think that it is impossible to solve your problem.  Drop the panic! <br><br><br><h5>  <font color="#ff3f5f">8. Do something you have never done</font> </h5><br>  Eat an exotic fruit, rent commercials, if the inspiration has left you completely and you are depressed.  To invent something new, you need to drop something old! <br><br><br><h5>  <font color="#ff3f5f">And advice 10.</font> </h5>  Do not be afraid of anything.  Search, dig and do not believe that your idea will find you! <br><br>  There was a brilliant idea, but you do not know how to implement it?  Perhaps <a href="http://icanchoose.ru/blog/karernye-sovety-ot-osnovatelya-slack/">advice from CEO Slack</a> will help you? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292680/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292680/</a></p>
