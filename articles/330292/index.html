Let's poke a little bit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d8e/c1c/734/d8ec1c734c214811b534c615271168a5.png"><br><br>  This year was looking forward to WWDC.  While Apple is sitting <a href="https://appleinsider.ru/iphone/glavnoe-otchet-apple-za-pervyj-kvartal-2017-goda.html">on the biggest cache cache in history</a> , competitors are propped up on all sides.  Google with phones, Amazon with Alex, Microsoft with AR - at some point it even seemed that Apple was starting to catch up, not lead.  But today's keynote has returned everything to its place. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Norm </h3><br>  I have been to WWDC twice, this time I decided to look from home.  Apparently, wrong, this conference is the most intense in many years.  Even by the speed with which they began to announce all the features, it was clear that they would show A LOT.  And the guys did not let us down. <br><br>  Here is the new iOS, and so the long-awaited update of macbooks and aimags.  And a cool new iMac Pro for just a modest 5000, a new makos, aypad, very high-quality AR, and HomePod.  It's hard to remember a more eventful event from Apple.  About all sorts of new iOS and MacOS chips, it's not even particularly interesting to write, <a href="https://vc.ru/p/wwdc-2017">read on VC</a> .

    <h3>  High </h3><br>  That is what really attracted attention. <br><br>  <b>iPad with 120Hz support.</b>  Those who sat at the gaming monitors understand the difference between 60 and 120 and know how noticeably this changes the perception of the interface.  Very correct step.  Until the Androids have done the same, the iPad will look like a buttery smooth device.  After it, it will be hard to use other devices.  Obviously, in the near future we will see the same 120Hz on the iPhone, so we are waiting for the fall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/97a/a59/9e1/97aa599e1dd9421798f34116948002ff.png"><br><br>  <b>New iron.</b>  Finally, the belated update of MacBooks and aimaks came, but this is not surprising.  But the fact that the guys took the Mac Pro and shoved it into the body of the iMac - deserves respect.  Apple still does not want to lose the race of professional desktop computers, have made every effort.  And thank God, otherwise I already thought Hackintosh to build on the basis of PC components.  Because even top-end hardware slows down when Gradle is annealed, or Swift compiler decides to go through the entire project.  Price horse, but I am sure that <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/tehnologii/342439-glavnyy-konkurent-uber-v-ssha-privlek-investicii-na-600-mln">hipsters startups with estimates of a few yards</a> will buy such machines. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/022/428/cc9/022428cc9fe34b0dab7280b65a00260d.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>HomePod.</b>  The logical and expected response to Google Home and Amazon Echo.  I wonder how good the sound will be in such a small speaker.  Let's see what the reviewers will write.  I'm a little worried about the guys from Sonos, because the Multi speaker room already has both Google and Apple doing, and the guys still haven't laid out a full integration with services.  After all, for almost a year we have been waiting for the integration of Sonos and Echo.  Well, the opportunity to have Siri in the house with HomeKit is also very convenient.  For example, because Alexa and Google Home control many devices through the Web API, which personally causes permanent brakes in my home when you ask the lights to turn off.  But HomeKit works directly with them, so it is often easier to say Siri ‚ÄúHey Siri, Dim the lights‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e6a/d98/b8b/e6ad98b8b7fa45ccb47a75f0098bdef2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>ARKit.</b>  The most delicious and cool.  What really sets it apart from competitors like Google Tango is that it works without any additional sensors and will be available on hundreds of millions of devices at once.  This is a strong punch in the direction of Google, which has been working on Tango technologies for many years, but has never achieved even the slightest distribution.  Judging by the demo, the technology works quite smoothly and causes a wow effect.  Something like Minecraft on Hololens.  Hundreds of technology applications for games, apartment planners, and Enterprise solutions are waiting for us in the near future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f14/86f/f06/f1486ff067fd49d1a9b173a4542add7c.png"><br><br><h3>  We work on </h3><br>  By the way, Apple's emphasis on hardware, Metal 2, ARKit and the ability to connect a VR headset to a Mac is a very interesting development for the company.  It seems to me that they are really preparing for a new type of AR device a la Magic Leap and for this they customize the whole surrounding technology stack (iron, graphics engines, Tools) and prepare the audience through an intermediate version of ARKit. <br><br>  For the next 5-10 years, a powerful movement towards some kind of new content consumption is definitely expected.  Today‚Äôs Apple presentation showed that they are actively working on it.  And there is already something to show. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330292/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330292/</a></p>
