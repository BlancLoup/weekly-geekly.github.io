  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Girls through the eyes of IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  1) There is a freeware - girlfriend, and time-limited shareware - bride.  The licensed copy is called the "wife."  Moreover, the procedure of licensing is very complicated and expensive, everyone knows that ... And the terms of the license agreement, in kind, draconian are sheer duties and no rights like returning within thirty days. <br><br>  It would seem, why the hell they are needed, these wives, why not always use freeware?  Versions can be downloaded almost every day.  But here, damn, it turns out, not without problems! <br><br>  2) First - almost all freeware versions bother with messages offering to register a copy and are often functionally limited.  They are breaking for a long time and not always successfully ... Secondly: you need to use them carefully, after carefully installing the anti-virus application and reliable, without security holes, firewall.  Otherwise, even one crazy package during a connection can send the entire system down for nine months, causing a constant increase in the size of the swap on the hard disk. You will either have to contact a specialist who cleans the swap and removes all unnecessary, or license a copy.  And this for a cool hacker is tantamount to formatting a broom with a large sandpaper and a rusty nail.  There are, of course, multi-user systems that stand in these ... well, how are they ... such as an Internet cafe: come, choose, use.  They can be used if necessary, and the payment is mainly hourly, although there are still problems with viruses.  And if you estimate, then the result is not cheap.

      3) The important functions of the girls are often undocumented, the sources are closed, and help is absolutely stupid.  And the support service, damn it, even if you have a licensed copy, I wanted to sneeze on you!  Here it is.  In addition, the installed system constantly has to be protected from hacker attacks, and it is very difficult to keep several different versions at the same time, as they constantly conflict. <br><br>  4) There is still, damn, a bunch of known bugs, such as when the system completely clears your cash and uninstalls itself. Or, it constantly generates a busy signal in the handset, not responding to interruptions.  In stores and in front of a mirror, they generally immediately hang tight and can hang for hours, even if you burst ... The problems start from the very beginning, from the moment of choosing the right distribution with sensible polygraphy, not pocked and without viruses.  And then, damn, there is a complex and lengthy installation process: the system has to be loaded and mollified for a long time, in general - a solid hemorrhoids ... So that's what I realized in the end: Windows and girls - this is practically the same thing!  Type as from one barrel poured!  Judge for yourself: both those and others have a nice, seemingly friendly interface, like cool cars and spend a lot of valuable system resources ... Their nature is capricious, and quirks are unpredictable.  It is rarely possible to uninstall without incident, usually radical measures have to be taken ... One word: Give mast girls!  That, however, inspires some hope ... <br><br>  Found on the Internet </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15415/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15415/</a></p>
