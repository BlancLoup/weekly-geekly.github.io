This conclusion was made on the basis of an analysis of the number of downloads of Top-200 applications on iOS, while non-game applications were not taken into account in this report. <br><br>  During October, there were 7.8 million downloads of applications from the Top-200 list per day against 5.5 million in September.  At the same time, the average installation price in October rose by 21% to $ 1.46.

      So the launch of Apple devices allows not only to beat records on sales of devices, but also records on the number of downloads per day! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Mobile Internet Development Forecasts </h4><br>  Some interesting graphs from the quarterly Ericsson Mobility Report on the development of mobile Internet. <br><br>  The most rapid growth among services is expected from the mobile Internet: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/668/585/8a7/6685858a76f64fcfb5e25661a2e3eb86.png"><br><br>  Only by 2020 it will be possible to say that a third of active devices will support LTE: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6e/c67/a20/d6ec67a208ce446ba211fea7b5a28262.png"><br><br>  Where and how developed the mobile Internet can be seen in the following graph, but in some regions the supply exceeds the demand by a third: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e77/5d9/2b4/e775d92b4f5a4dec9fe21f28c1a8ba87.png"><br><br>  You can see more interesting graphs and conclusions <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/ericsson_images/sets/72157649326666221/">here</a> . <br><br><br><h4>  Opera launches stor for operators </h4><br>  Mobile operators <a href="http://apptractor.ru/deploy/app-stores/opera-zapuskaet-magazin-prilozheniy-i-igr-dlya-operatorov.html">can now</a> create their own stores with a wide choice of applications and games thanks to the Opera Subscription Mobile Store solution.  Users of these stores will be able to download an unlimited number of applications for a small weekly fee. <br><br>  Opera Subscription Mobile Store, which is already used by five operators on three continents, has received an extensive catalog of applications and games, Opera Mobile Store - the third largest application store in the world.  Opera Subscription Mobile Store provides operators with games like Minecraft, Angry Birds, Star Wars II, My Talking Tom, Ice Age and more.  These applications are available on more than 6,000 mobile phone models on various platforms, such as Android, Java, Symbian and BlackBerry.  Opera constantly rotates and updates applications in the store, the catalog of which weekly replenishes thousands of developers. <br><br><br><h4>  Xiaomi launches Mi App Store to the world market </h4><br>  The Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi and the authors of the add-on to the android MIUI are sometimes called the Chinese Apple.  More recently, nobody knew about them, and now their share on the world market is 5.1%. <br><br>  The growth was excellent - last year they occupied only 1.8% of the market, and apparently, the Chinese do not intend to stop.  In order to consolidate and develop the success, Xiaomi <a href="http://apptractor.ru/deploy/app-stores/xiaomi-vyivodit-mi-app-store-na-mirovoy-ryinok.html">launched</a> their application store and now plan to promote it worldwide.  So far, their ‚ÄúMi App Store‚Äù is available in Chinese and English and opens to developers from Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore.  Soon it will be open for all other countries. <br><br>  Judging by how rapidly the company is developing, they have every chance to succeed and stand on one step with the most famous brands. At the moment, the store has more than 3000 applications and over the past six months more than 5 billion downloads have been made. <br><br><br><h4>  Santa Claus and corporate disassembly </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de5/dde/bd5/de5ddebd553f4bb18ed4e5987944433f.png"><br>  Did you know that in the framework of the ‚Äúthrow out Google into the cold‚Äù campaign, Microsoft wiped out the corporation from the partnership with NORAD on tracking Santa Claus's movement?  Yes, here is a twist.  But Google is not going to give up and runs the site for working with Santa - <a href="https://santatracker.google.com/">Santa Tracker</a> . <br><br>  Throughout December, new projects and games will be laid out on it, and so on until the very Christmas Eve.  In addition, there is an application for tracking grandpa from a personal smartphone, tablet and even a TV.  An important note - this year the sled tracking algorithm was promised to be improved. <br><br>  How will NORAD‚Äôs official Santa tracking partner respond to this?  Hey, the site within the Internet Explorer promotion company, of course!  Improved performance, optimized for mobile, ‚Äúrethink what the web can be‚Äù, all things.  By the way, it will be possible to follow Santa on Bing Maps, and this is not accidental.  And on December 24, it will be possible to do this in real time on an interactive 3D-globe, and on clicks you can get a page with interesting and fun facts and beautiful pictures.  And the site promises responsive design, so that it can be fully used on all mobile devices. <br><br>  Well, if you decided to follow Santa, who would be your choice? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244967/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244967/</a></p>
