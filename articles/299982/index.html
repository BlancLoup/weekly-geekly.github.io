Good morning and pleasant reading! </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fae/0c6/270/fae0c6270ac34c8ba5442199680fafd6.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first online consulting services, in the form of chat rooms, were commissioned in 2002-2003.  Large portals like e-Bay immediately saw in this technology an opportunity to increase sales, providing more information for customers.  Such assistants promise to increase conversion by 30% or more, provided that you have chosen a really good service and your operators will support it around the clock. <br><br>  In 2016, chats have become more convenient and accessible for different platforms (for example, for iOS and Android).  In the review, <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3DmegamozgChat%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">we</a> collected information on 5 popular online chats, which are actively used by customers to this day. <br><br><h5>  <b>Comparative analysis</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b84/c28/3e2/b84c283e27e343f5a3ac5ee2bf10a1f6.jpg">

They offer quick installation of the script and the highest possible payment methods.  For small companies, it is possible to use the system for free, but with limited functions. <br>  A distinctive feature is the presence of a demo on the site that does not require registration. <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.jivosite.ru/">JivoSite</a> </li></ul><br>  Simple and intuitive service in Russian.  It is possible to test the functionality for free for 14 days, or use the version for 790 rubles - 1 month.  The program is suitable for users of Windows, Linux and Mac, and not every chat has this. <br>  There is an advanced option "active invitations", which can be reconfigured.  For example, so that the chat window will work if the visitor has been delayed on the page for more than 20 seconds. <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.siteheart.ru/">Siteheart</a> </li></ul><br>  The service can send messages automatically, using pre-prepared scripts or through a real operator (You can hire directly on the Siteheart site when ordering services). <br>  A feature of the service is the ability to bind the card number to receive fast payments from customers via chat. <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://ru.zopim.com/">Zopim</a> </li></ul><br>  One of the most advanced and convenient tools for communication between the operator and visitors.  Supports any browsers and OS.  Zopim has very affordable prices - for a standard package you will pay only $ 20 per month, and in return you will get full access to all chat features. <br>  Those.  support communicates in English through a translator.  But it is difficult to call it a big problem, as the operators explain everything in as much detail as possible and there are no questions left. <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.streamwood.ru/">Streamwood</a> </li></ul><br>  Simple chat with basic functions: invitation to talk, inter-operator chat, blocking unwanted users.  Collects information about visitors and issues reports, like other services. <br>  The default appearance of the window and automatic messages causes the window to be a bit annoying, but this can be corrected by customizing the functions to your liking. <br><br><h6>  <b>Results</b> </h6><br>  As you can see, the set of functions of the services is in many ways similar, but there are significant differences that can be identified in your personal account.  Choose a suitable service is not difficult, since all services have a test period.  Some even have free fares. <br><br>  It should be noted that integrated communications are becoming increasingly popular in marketing.  For example, combining chat and callback services.  The most important thing in collecting leads from the site is a well-written offer of services and non-obtrusiveness.  Keep this in mind if you are thinking of using both technologies at the same time. <br><br>  By the way, some experts believe that the future of chat rooms is in joining communication services, such as, for example, WhatsApp or Viber.  In confirmation of this hypothesis, one can quote the words of Zuckerberg about the statistics of visits to the WhatsApp service acquired by him: 800 million users per month. <br><br>  Do you think this promising direction for marketing or users will be embarrassed by the use of social networks to communicate with managers? <br><br><h6>  <b>Promotional PS</b> </h6><br>  Entrust feedback from your site in good hands. <br>  <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3DmegamozgChat%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">We</a> guarantee an increase in conversion from the site and give <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3DmegamozgChat%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">7 days of free test</a> after registration. <br>  The number of applications from the site will increase, make sure that! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299982/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299982/</a></p>
