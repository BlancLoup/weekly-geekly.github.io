      The constant increase in the complexity and system requirements of embedded applications is forcing engineers to increasingly use integrated design environments in order to get a more intelligent, productive and convenient development tool.  Based on the latest version of Microsoft Visual Studio Shell, Atmel Studio 7 significantly reduces overall design time, allowing you to significantly increase the efficiency of development and debugging, using an easy-to-use user interface, and more quickly respond to the modern requirements of the consumer and industrial electronics market.  Atmel Studio 7 also offers a powerful tool for visualizing real-time system performance and power consumption data to better optimize performance and power consumption. <br><br>  For the amateur radio community and inventors working with the Arduino platform, Studio 7 offers the opportunity to port their sketches created in the Arduino environment to C ++ projects and easily transfer them to the professional Studio 7. Atmel continues to support independent developers all the way <a href="http://de.slideshare.net/SanderArts2/from-makerspace-to-marketplace">from idea to market launch of the final product</a> . <br><br>  With the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT) market and the emergence of billions of devices expected by 2020, high-quality, highly integrated built-in software is becoming a key element in creating reliable communication solutions based on modern communication and security standards.  Atmel's announced Atmel START platform is an online tool that helps developers easily and quickly integrate basic software blocks and concentrate on creating their own applications. <br><br>  The Atmel START graphical web interface allows the user to select the desired software components and configure them to work with an extensive family of Atmel debugging boards or with their own system.  Developers can create software platforms that include low-level drivers, middleware, real-time operating system (RTOS), high-level network protocol stacks, and more.  In addition, Atmel START supports the graphical configuration of the pin assignment table and clocking system.  A configurable software package can be downloaded to any supported development environment, including Atmel Studio 7, IAR Embedded Workbench and Keil ¬µVision.  Atmel START is exclusively an Internet application that does not require pre-installation, and the content available for download will always be the latest version. <br><br><h4>  Atmel studio 7 </h4><br>  Easier to use and more productive than ever. <br>  Atmel Studio 7 is a global update of the industry's leading integrated design environment (IDE) and includes a number of significant changes and additions: <br><ul><li>  Updated Visual Studio Shell to version 2015, with full support for Windows 10 </li><li>  Ability to import Arduino sketches as C ++ projects </li><li>  An advanced context-based help system allows you to view technical documentation directly from the Studio environment. </li><li>  Modular installer (allows you to download and install only the necessary user components) </li><li>  Full support for all the latest Atmel microcontrollers, including Bluetooth Low Energy devices </li></ul><br>  The new Atmel Studio 7 can be installed in parallel with the already installed Studio 6.2, provided that the two versions are installed in different directories.  However, the manufacturer strongly recommends upgrading the existing version to the latest, since it contains a number of important additions and corrections.  Existing projects are 100% compatible with the Studio 7 environment. <br><br>  The Atmel Studio 7 integrated design environment is available for download at: <a href="http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELSTUDIO.aspx">http://www.atmel.com/tools/ATMELSTUDIO.aspx</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/946/865/afd/946865afd71d4de0b2ee44e1d9225bdb.png"><br><br><h4>  Atmel start </h4><br>  Atmel START is a new tool that offers users an intuitive graphical interface for configuring and building embedded application code, low-level drivers, middleware, demo applications and, in the future, basic projects. <br><br>  Unlike Studio 7, the Atmel START platform is completely web-based and does not require installation of any components.  Go to the Atmel START application page: <a href="http://start.atmel.com/">http://start.atmel.com</a> <br><br>  Atmel START allows users to immediately start developing applications, and using a convenient graphical environment, simply and elegantly select, build and download the necessary software components to one of Atmel's debugging boards or to their own system. <br><br>  In addition, Atmel START supports a graphical interface for pin configuration, for AVR microcontrollers, and clocking systems, for ARM microcontrollers of the Atmel |  SMART. <br><br>  At any time during the configuration process, the resulting code corresponding to the current settings can be viewed by the user directly in the browser. <br><br>  Atmel START is abstracted from a specific design environment.  Once all software components are configured, the user can create a project for a specific development environment.  Currently, projects can be created for Atmel Studio IDE, IAR Embedded Workbench and ARM / Keil MDK. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2b8/712/2a8/2b87122a8eac4a3d84799e44b47b9faa.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Supported Microcontrollers </h5><br>  Atmel START currently supports the following microcontroller and debug families: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bf/871/80a/9bf87180abe14d4fa981d28e4366674e.PNG"><br>  New microcontrollers and debug boards will be added regularly in future releases. <br><br><h5>  Atmel START program code </h5><br>  Atmel START software code is based on the 4th version of the Atmel Software Framework Library (ASFv4).  ASFv4 is a global architectural update of the ASF library to optimize execution time, size, and interpretation of program code.  For this reason, the ASFv4 code is not 100% compatible with previous versions of the ASF library, including any programs created in the ASF Wizard included with Atmel Studio.  Previous versions of ASF will be supported until Atmel's commitment to support products released under this architecture expires, but further software development will focus on the ASFv4 platform and Atmel START </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/275385/">https://habr.com/ru/post/275385/</a></p>
