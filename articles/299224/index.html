  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In search of loyalty: ‚ÄúYulmart‚Äù will launch an online messenger to buy goods</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Online retailer <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582">"Ulmart"</a> and IT-developer <a href="http://brainstorage.me/companies/iconto">iConto</a> become partners.  Dmitry Kostygin, chairman of the board of directors and co-owner of Yulmarth, said that the new partner will help introduce loyalty programs for customers and technology to exchange messages with them.  The retailer is going to launch an online messenger for customers, with which it will be possible to choose products and make purchases. <br><br>  The messenger is based on technologies developed about three years ago by the St. Petersburg group iConto. <br>  ‚ÄúWe have agreed on a strategic partnership: they bring in all the technologies, we give opportunities.  We did not want to take a foreign technology, they are all encrypted, can be disabled, and they can break.  Therefore, we took our St. Petersburg development, "explains Dmitry Kostygin. <br><br>  Ulmart will use a universal customer card (from iConto) compatible with any type of cash equipment and software as its loyalty card.  Such a card can be connected to loyalty programs of an unlimited number of enterprises. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Now cards can be obtained in the Optoklub ‚ÄúRows‚Äù (project of Dmitry Kostygin and his partner, the minority shareholder of Yulmart by August Meyer), and from April 4, cards will be distributed at Ylmart shopping outlets and a number of stores.  A representative of Yulmart <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2933848">confirmed</a> to Kommersant that the new service will be launched in April. <br><blockquote>  At the end of 2015, Kostigin established Alol LLC.  According to kartoteka.ru, Dmitry Kostygin has 50% of OOO Alol, the remaining 50% in equal shares with the company‚Äôs general director Andrei Grinkevich-Sudnik and three individuals.  With this legal entity iConto and concluded an agreement. <br><br>  The kartoteka.ru contains data on the Cyprus Iconto Limited, which controls two Russian LLCs - Aikonto and Aikonto Rus. </blockquote>  Several million dollars were invested in the development of the online messenger.  At the end of 2015, the turnover of Yulmart (one of the largest retailers in Russia) amounted to 62.7 billion rubles. <br><br>  iConto also helps with the loyalty program controlled by the Ministry of Defense of Voentorg JSC and Gazprombank.  Voentorg JSC, in particular, organizes retail sales of goods under the brand "Army of Russia". <br><br>  According to the iConto website, which has been preserved in the Yandex cache, more than 46 thousand users and more than 14 thousand companies participate in loyalty programs.  When creating a joint venture, all obligations to them will be fulfilled, and cooperation with Gazprombank will continue, Dmitry Kostygin promises. <br><br>  The growth rate of Russian e-commerce in 2015 decreased to 7%, Kommersant <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2933039">wrote</a> on March 9.  The volume of online sales in Russia in 2015 amounted to 760 billion rubles, follows from the joint report of the Association of E-commerce Companies (ACIT) and Russian Post.  At the same time, the number of domestic orders fell by 17%, while the volume of receipts from abroad grew by 75%. <br><br>  The obvious solution to this problem is to improve interaction with the already existing client base: if it is difficult to attract new customers, why not motivate current customers to buy more and buy more?  Or, for example, to motivate people to bring their friends, <a href="http://www.shopolog.ru/metodichka/customer-retention/razvitie-programm-loyalnosti/">wrote</a> Yakov Filippenko on the site shopolog.ru: <br><blockquote>  We need a loyalty program for customers, the purpose of which is to raise the brand's credibility in the eyes of the buyer, build strong relationships with it and thus turn the buyer who has made his first order into a permanent one, and a constant one into a loyal one.  That is, one that will recommend you to your friends and take into account your previous communication experience in determining where he will next use the services or buy the goods. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299224/</a></p>
