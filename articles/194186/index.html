      Under the cut - a few thoughts on the topic of the day. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Perhaps I'll start with the good. </h4><br>  On our birthday, I would like to talk about those users who make new distributions.  (We have new hands - more than 600 daily). <br><br>  Frankly speaking, I was always surprised that it was driven by those people who sometimes with maniacal persistence fill the trackers with their releases.  We have neither karma, nor likes, nor ratings, gaining which one could indulge in his CSW, laying out new materials.  Unlike blogs and social networks, where a person fills his page by bulging and advertising his ego, the releaseer does not require any attention to his personality on the tracker.  Making your distribution on the rutracker is not entirely simple - this process is intentionally formalized to exclude the placement of fakes and / or low-quality material.  Nevertheless, the number of people willing to do their distribution is huge.  So much so that we have a constant shortage of moderators in many sections.  Something that drives people and content that has been digitized for decades and laid out on the network.  We even made a group of "Keepers and Antiquaries" which is engaged in the popularization of especially rare and interesting distributions in this regard. <br><br>  I unfortunately did not find any significant research on the intrinsic motivation of the releasers, probably this is not yet a investigated behavioral phenomenon.  But if there are any, it will be interesting to read their comments. <br><br>  Further. <br><br><h4>  From good to all beloved owners </h4><br>  In connection with the latest events, this is a particularly painful topic, since a significant number of trackers have been hit by the new ‚Äúlaw on blocking‚Äù.  Separately, I note that at the moment there was only one complaint from Roskomnadzor about closing the distribution of the company, which already has a copyright holder account on the tracker, as a result, she herself also deleted these distributions. <br><br>  I still want to note 2 things: <br><br>  1) It is very sad that the state intervenes in the relationship between the producer of a media product and its consumer exclusively on the side of the first and protects only him.  In the usual commodity turnover, the situation is completely opposite - the law is on the consumer‚Äôs side, and it protects mainly its interests, imposing many duties on the manufacturer - from packaging labeling to expiration dates, guarantees, returns or exchanges. <br><br>  2) It is very sad that without having the technical ability to block a single distribution, the entire resource is blocked.  From a legal point of view, this is contrary to the whole bunch of articles of the Constitution.  From a household point of view, it looks like blackmailing trackers who have no way to get out of the situation except to comply with any requirements of the law that threatens to disconnect all users from Russia from it.  And from a technical point of view, it looks even more absurd - to block a resource, it‚Äôs enough to add its hash amount to the description of the movie (but more on that below). <br><br>  This implementation of the law on blocking turns its action upside down, depriving it of any meaning at all, because closing out tens of thousands from one distribution, is more like a targeted sweep, but not at all about respecting the rights of a single rightholder. <br><br>  In fact, according to our statistics, the right holders delete a tiny amount of information, and there is no tendency to increase its quantity.  (On the rutracker, the rightholders closed one and a half thousand hands, for almost one and a half million actives).  Gradually, the most advanced vendors, instead of dealing with p2p, are already using this medium for their own purposes - advertising, marketing, etc.  Probably it‚Äôs strange for you to hear against the background of general hysteria about the indiscriminate closure of trackers, but nevertheless it‚Äôs so - the activity of the right holders DOESN'T GROW, and the number of hands to be closed does not increase, rather there is a reverse trend. <br><br>  De facto, a huge amount of content is distributed freely, from the taciturn, let's say, non-resistance of the authors, for the simple reason that he is not interested in them from a financial point of view.  Therefore, the first and most necessary change in legislation that is required at the moment is <b>the lifting of the restriction on the free copying (without profit) of the work after (approximately) 10 years after the publication of the work</b> .  This is the first and most difficult step, which by the way does not contradict the tender care of the right holders, who are so famous for our legislators.  For the simple reason that (I repeat) outdated content is absolutely uninteresting from a financial point of view.  This measure will at least slightly lead legislation to the actual situation and, at the same time, will save a whole stratum of useless intermediaries from the easy enrichment between the producer and the consumer. <br><br><ul><li>  As an illustration of cognitive dissonance, we regularly receive letters from representatives of the State TV and Radio Foundation, Mosfilm and Lenfilm requesting to remove references to more than 5 thousand films shot back in the USSR (starting as early as 1936, the list is attached), to which they allegedly have exclusive property by rights.  In other words, the cultural heritage of the entire Soviet empire, which had been created at public expense for decades and, according to the principles of socialism declared at that time, was initially in the public domain (!) And <i>suddenly</i> found itself in the hands of private companies that are ready to dispose of it at their discretion. </li></ul><br><br>  It is necessary to fight against such ‚Äúrightholders‚Äù in all possible ways. <br><br>  At the same time, we share the position of the company, which, with enviable persistence, removes its <s>second-class</s> series and films of <s>category B</s> from the Internet, hoping to recoup their production, and may even earn some money.  One way or another, in a year or two their films and series will still be freely distributed online, or together with their creators will be safely forgotten.  ‚ÄúSit quietly on the bank of the river - and the corpse of your enemy will swim by‚Äù - maybe here Confucius had something in mind and file sharing too. <br><br>  Once again, Rutreker is positioning himself as a library of content, and not as a source of fresh releases (although he very often combines both).  Moreover, the presence of a large number of alternative trackers, where you can download the ‚Äúfresh‚Äù closed from us, is useful and even absolutely necessary, as it visually discredits any idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcontrolling the Internet and also the archaic nature of modern copyright laws (in terms of free copying information, of course, very few people claim for authorship on the Internet).  Despite this, we are regularly criticized for the fact that we ‚Äúsold ourselves to copywriters‚Äù, and I hope this time the voices of these <i>critics</i> will be heard from the very first comments. <br><br><h4>  Let's talk about technology. </h4><br>  Strange as it may seem, it‚Äôs not about VPN or i2p, although in some cases their use is justified and necessary. <br><br>  The development of streaming technologies (DHT and peer exchange in particular) has led to the fact that to download any distribution (if there are siders of course) you only need its hash sum, not even necessarily in the form of a torrent or magnet file (for example, 4F893C7584005BA4E4238D3F2EC02CECC551F385).  The tracker itself helps to initiate the process, but it is not an essential element, the question of finding the right peers is only a matter of time.  It remains only to somehow confirm the hash to the description (as moderators now do in forums) and this is the entire file-sharing network - in <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D4204390">one large text file.</a> <br><br><ul><li>  By the way, the more hands you have in the client - the bigger the peer cloud is, the more general tracking-less hands will be ‚Äústarted‚Äù faster - one more reason to keep as many hands as possible on your computer. </li></ul><br><br>  But from the point of view of the law, the hash sum is just that information which ‚Äúpromotes the distribution of non-licensed content,‚Äù it is necessary and sufficient for receiving the entire distribution.  So maybe the State Duma will prohibit the use of hash functions, or will it oblige profiders to filter traffic to detect "pirated" hash sums?  It is also an interesting topic for discussion and realization that any attempts to limit file sharing is a waste of effort and budget. <br><br><h4>  It was an abstract introduction, so to speak. </h4><br>  In general, the post was about the fact that we have a birthday and with might and main are <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D4537816">popular festivals</a> and national <a href="http://rutracker.org/forum/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D4526858">contests</a> <br>  . <br>  All users of Rutreker - with the holiday, and he himself - long life and prosperity! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194186/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194186/</a></p>
