      Although no one will argue that useful advice on the conduct of public affairs or business discord with the clamping of the Russian Federation on all fronts.  Sanctions, the ‚Äúsanitary cordon‚Äù of color revolutions, the <a href="https://lenta.ru/news/2016/02/25/sanctions1/">ban on banks to buy Russian bonds</a> , the rating downgrade for the country as a whole and for enterprises in particular, promises to tear the economy to pieces from the mouth of the President of the United States, pressed the ‚Äúbig sport‚Äù and even did not regret the Paralympians.  The State Department <a href="https://ria.ru/world/20160930/1478202795.html">has issued instructions</a> on banning companies from working with Russia, and US Vice President Biden <a href="http://www.bbc.com/russian/37665562">promises cyber attacks</a> . <br><br>  Why, then, Western intelligence services, which are actively <a href="http://www.vz.ru/world/2015/7/29/758464.html">used even in economic espionage between the allies</a> , have not yet had a friendly conversation with the management of consulting companies, have not explained to them who they should be friends with, and who they aren‚Äôt?  Well, of course they talked, though a little bit wrong. <br><br>  But still, how do these consultants manage to "please both ours and yours"? <br>  How do they conduct business in such a way that their activities are simultaneously approved by both the heads of companies of the Russian Federation and the Western special services? <br><br>  This is not magic and not art, it is a proven technology. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Article layout </h2><br>  1. <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312702/">Statement of the problem</a> <br>  2.

Statement of the problem </h2><br>  It is necessary to consult the companies of the Russian Federation in such a way that as a result they bring profits to Western multinational corporations, but they could never compete with them. <br><br>  Figuratively speaking, companies of the Russian Federation must grow into sheep, which will serve Western wolves with high-quality food supply. <br><br>  With the apparent increase in efficiency, Russian companies should become more dependent on Western technologies, licenses and political decisions than on their own government. <br><br>  Too globally swung?  I agree, let's narrow the topic of the article.  How can a director of a commercial enterprise inspire ideas that worsen the position of his company, but at the same time keep him in the illusion that everything is going as it should, and ‚Äúefficiency‚Äù has grown. <br><br>  Even less conspiracy?  We simply consider the evolution of the interaction of 5 subjects, each of which has its own interests: <br><br>  <b>C1.</b>  CEO of the Company.  The person is intelligent, but needs advice to make changes in the work of the Company.  The changes according to his plan are aimed at real improvements, options like ‚Äústealing a plant and sawing for scrap‚Äù is not a topic of this, but other articles (mostly from the Criminal Code). <br><br>  <b>C2.</b>  Top management of the company.  The subordinates of the general director who are interested in preserving their high-paying job are very loyal to the initiatives of their boss. <br><br>  <b>C3.</b>  Company employees.  Since the director is idealized with us, then let the employees be professionals in their work, interested in the conscientious performance of work and the preservation of their jobs. <br><br>  <b>C4.</b>  The staff of "local offices" consulting companies.  Its goal is to expand and strengthen the consulting business.  And no one before them sets the task of ensuring the conquest of world domination for the elite of another country. <br><br>  <b>C5.</b>  Owners and foreign management consulting companies.  They want to increase revenues, but are limited in their actions by considerations of national security and the interests of big business in their countries.  (This is a simplification of the real situation, but the main thing for us is that the interests of our country are certainly not in priority). <br><br><a name="p2"></a><h2>  2. The modest role of the assistant manager </h2><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://hbr-russia.ru/liderstvo/psikhologiya-liderstva/a17082/">Consultants are needed to gather information.</a>  <a href="http://hbr-russia.ru/liderstvo/psikhologiya-liderstva/a17082/">They know how others did, but they do not know how to do it themselves</a> .  G. Gref. </blockquote><br>  If you ask, dear readers, what are the duties of an employee at the ‚Äúsecretary‚Äù position, then you will probably answer: save your boss from non-intellectual, routine work.  The secretary is the assistant manager - to bring orders for the signature, notify the subordinates about the meeting, prepare coffee and all that jazz. <br><br>  But did it not seem strange to you that the highest state post in the USSR was called ‚ÄúGeneral Secretary of the Central Committee of the CPSU‚Äù?  How did it happen that in the USSR the secretary actually became the head of the party and the country? <br><br>  Wikipedia tells us that <br><blockquote>  The secretary of the Central Committee <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258C_%25D0%25A6%25D0%259A_%25D0%259A%25D0%259F%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A1">carried out general management: he approved one or another agenda of the congress / party meeting and determined the degree of readiness of the draft decisions submitted for consideration</a> . <br></blockquote><br>  And so, in just 5 years after the revolution, the President of the Council of People's Commissars, VI, who had fallen, but still the actual leader of the party,  Lenin wrote a famous <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BA_%25D1%2581%25D1%258A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583">letter to the congress</a> , in which he complains that the Secretary of the Central Committee Stalin ‚Äúconcentrated the immense power in his hands‚Äù ... And he received this power informally, purely on authority - <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%258C_%25D0%25A6%25D0%259A_%25D0%259A%25D0%259F%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A1">clear rights and duties for the position of ‚Äúsecretary general‚Äù in the Party Charter were written only in 1966</a> ! <br><br>  The Secretary of the Central Committee, I.V. Stalin, was very clever and useful for the common cause, and the right to ‚Äúapprove the agenda‚Äù gradually turned into ‚Äúform the agenda‚Äù.  The obligation to ‚Äúdetermine the degree of readiness of draft decisions‚Äù has grown to ‚Äúapprove the wording in documents‚Äù. <br><br>  He also took over such a routine work as the counting of votes and, to put it in modern manners, some of the responsibilities in the field of HR.  He <a href="https://ru.wikiquote.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">expressed the</a> experience of fulfilling these duties <a href="https://ru.wikiquote.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">in immortal formulations</a> : <br><blockquote>  No matter how voted, it is important, as calculated. <br>  Frames decide everything.  The most valuable capital is people. <br></blockquote><br>  When in 1924 the very letter of Lenin about the ‚Äúimmense power‚Äù was read out at the party congress, a modest, disciplined and loyal member of the Comrade Party.  Joseph Stalin immediately refused his post as Secretary of the Central Committee.  Moreover, he had <u>several times</u> put the question of his resignation before the plenum of the Central Committee, since his confidence in him had been called into question.  But party comrades voted to stay.  True, not unanimously - supporters of Trotsky voted against.  By 1931, they figured out why - it turned out that <a href="https://ru.wikiquote.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">"Trotskyism is the vanguard of the counter-revolutionary bourgeoisie</a> . <a href="https://ru.wikiquote.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">"</a> <br><br><blockquote>  But let us return to the main topic: the topic of an attempt to conquer political power not with the help of a palace coup, rebellion, revolution, or even democratic elections, but with the help of a group of people who have gone through the game.  Which become so indispensable as advisers to top politicians and (a little later) the generators of basic state ideas, that gradually, first, real, and then legal-political power passes to them. <br></blockquote><br>  Yes, it was a quote - from the article <a href="https://gilbo.ru/index.php%3Fpage%3Dvokrugigr%26art%3D2198">‚ÄúIgrotechnika from Schedrovitsky to Khodorkovsky‚Äù</a> .  Very interesting, although it may not be everything in it should be believed - <a href="http://litobozrenie.com/2016/10/demonicheskie-igry-chast-iii/">where I found it,</a> they doubt that the games were already so widespread.  But we have enough evidence that the technology of manipulating decision-makers through their assistant advisers was developed and tested. <br><br><a name="p3"></a><h2>  3. Victory loves preparation </h2><br><br>  But let us return to the main topic: the topic of an attempt to conquer political and economic power not through a palace coup, an uprising, revolution, or even democratic elections, but through the expansion and strengthening of the consulting business of a group of specially trained people.  Which become so indispensable as advisers to the top management of commercial companies and (a little later) generators of the basic ideas of commercial success, that gradually real power passes to them. <br><br>  Our consulting benefactors to help business directors collect and systematize information about who and what methods had previously achieved commercial success.  They can also advise where it is profitable to attach a profit: they will tell you which bank or offshore it is.  Or maybe it is better to buy some competitor or partner?  And this will be prompted, and the fair value of the transaction will be calculated - in their hands the valuation of the assets of enterprises and the financial audit. <br>  They will be happy to help with staffing questions for key positions in client companies - I will give an example below. <br><br>  You can see for yourself - purely secretarial support work and some HR.  They do not make any decisions, they do not bear any responsibility: <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://hbr-russia.ru/liderstvo/psikhologiya-liderstva/a17082/">I do not treat consultants as people whose advice should be followed.</a>  <a href="http://hbr-russia.ru/liderstvo/psikhologiya-liderstva/a17082/">On that they and advisers that all decisions are accepted by you.</a>  G. Gref. </blockquote><br>  Well said.  But do not you think that, in fact, the conditions for consultants are even more favorable than those of the Secretary of the Central Committee in the period 1917-1922?  Opportunities - even more, and risks and responsibilities - even less? <br><br>  And what will happen if the general director of the company does not accept any other "advice" from anyone, or they do not receive it, do not reach it? <br><br>  <b>Any director can be manipulated under two conditions:</b> <br><br>  <b>1. If he himself is a professional, then he is not in the profile of the company</b> (a typical example is a financier in the management of a non-financial organization). <br>  <b>2. There is no feedback from the professionals of their own company.</b> <br><br>  In order to achieve a constant possibility of manipulation, a constant supporting work is needed, which can be depicted in the form of a variation on the theme of the ‚ÄúDeming cycle‚Äù so beloved by the consultants: <br><br><img width="720" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d63/964/7a1/d639647a1c1a484d9cc80563b51c2e32.gif"><br>  1. Measures to increase the susceptibility of the top management environment to the manipulation of consultants. <br>  2. The introduction of the necessary ideas into the consciousness of top management. <br>  3. Noticing traces of negative consequences in reporting. <br>  4. Registration of the case on the next "success" and return to paragraph 1. <br><br>  As the Romans said in such cases - <b>Amat Victoria Curam</b> - Victory loves preparation. <br><br><a name="p4"></a><h2>  4.

They brought up and in many ways created the modern Ukrainian elite.  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2,_%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Azarov N.Ya.</a> </blockquote><br>  Of course, not only in Kiev.  Here is a picture of the Russian Federation. <br><br><img width="716" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1f/3ae/f6d/c1f3aef6d20f40988e2423b19b403d31.gif"><br><br>  Picture taken <a href="http://ru-politics.livejournal.com/46893852.html">from here</a> . <br><br>  <a href="http://transcript.duma.gov.ru/node/4297/">Transcript of the Plenary Session of the Duma 06/09/2015 (16: 00-18: 00)</a> : <br><blockquote>  All the listed consulting companies are officially appointed following the results of tenders that are designed so that only foreign companies can win, and all of them are American, because they are under the control of the Americans - there are simply no other consulting companies!  We regard this law as an attempt, let's say, to push bodies, ministries, departments, companies to look at this matter in a reasonable way.  But whether they understand this or not, they understand perfectly well!  Remember the last statement of the head of the Investigative Committee Bastrykin - he directly said that the mechanism behind it (and behind this is the 15th article of the Constitution of the Russian Federation is not just that) - this is, in fact, a mechanism of legal sabotage.  This is a struggle, and in it, let's say, strength, not common sense, wins, and the alignment of forces is such that today the ministry prefers to be guided by the principle of attracting ‚Äúbrains‚Äù from the United States of America. </blockquote><br>  We note in passing that if tenders are specifically ‚Äúdesigned so that only foreign companies can win,‚Äù it means that there is an understanding that they cannot withstand the conditions of equal competition. <br><br>  The destruction of the USSR, the change of laws, the seizure of power and property, created a situation where incompetent persons appeared in the management of enterprises.  Incompetent in changed conditions, without relative depth of their mind. <br><br>  But for them, consultants <b>had</b> already been prepared in advance, ready to tell you what to do and how to become leaders of ‚Äúcapitalist construction‚Äù. <br><br>  The advice of consultants was also needed by those ‚Äúred directors‚Äù who held their places, privatizing the company for themselves.  It was necessary to rebuild the business under the "market" economy, move to international reporting and go on an IPO. <br><br>  The same applies to those new enterprises that have already been created in ‚Äúmarket‚Äù conditions.  Without foreign consultants, big business was not created. <br><br><a name="p5"></a><h2>  5. Training top management and gaining its trust </h2><br>  To prevent the ‚Äúsoil‚Äù of top management from being exhausted, it was ‚Äúfertilized‚Äù - new management personnel were trained from ‚Äúgolden youth‚Äù in MBA courses, who could not do without the advice of consultants. <br><br>  In short, an MBA is built on ‚Äúcase study‚Äù, where instead of a systematic (scientific) approach, a set of ‚Äúsuccessful‚Äù templates is taught, thereby creating a predisposition to ‚Äúclip thinking‚Äù. <br><br>  The lack of independence of thinking necessitates maintaining communication with the ‚Äúteachers‚Äù for regular consultations both on the subject of adaptation of old cases, and for obtaining new cases, i.e.  Information about what has appeared in the ‚Äúworld of top management‚Äù, in the world of effective management of large companies. <br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://hbr-russia.ru/liderstvo/psikhologiya-liderstva/a17082/">We are a team of top managers of Sberbank every year for 7-8 days we go to Stanford ... we study on a program specially prepared for us ....</a>  G. Gref. <br></blockquote><br>  What more wish?  These are the most suitable conditions for directing the thoughts of top management in the right direction. <br><br>  Imagine even a less hothouse situation: a top-management meeting is organized at the enterprise in order to work out a further work strategy in our difficult times. <br>  The secretarial work is happily taken by the consultants - they will prepare presentations on cases from other companies, etc. <br><br>  And in the course of the play, the consultant says that, for some people, in the same situation, having such KPIs did this and that, they got a gain, etc.  The CEO at this moment asks his subordinates - and what are our indicators? <br><br>  The trick here is that the consultants who are leading the meeting know in advance what specific indicator is being discussed, and the rest are not.  Someone for memory knows exactly all the numerical values ‚Äã‚Äãof the KPI related to it, but someone does not.  In general, the impression that the consultants know the state of the client company better than its own top management will be achieved.  Especially the one that did not use the help of consultants in the preparation for the meeting. <br><br>  So the consultants solve their task - to strengthen communication with the general director and top management of the company, to gain more and more trust. <br><br>  Direct implementation is also not discounted: <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://changellenge.com/career/mfon/">Rare vacancy: position of a senior analyst in Megafon Strategy.</a>  <a href="http://changellenge.com/career/mfon/">We need a person with 1.5-2 years of experience in positions in the field of analysis, evaluation, business development and strategic planning, or at least 1 year in consulting ...</a> <br><br>  Strategy MegaFon is a small, young team of 14 people.  Our approach to work and the atmosphere are focused on the standards of leading international strategic consultants, from whom we differ in proximity to business and a greater opportunity to implement ideas and solutions in life.  We work directly with top management and interact a lot with regional branches, functional divisions and subsidiaries of MegaFon PJSC. <br></blockquote><br>  Let's analyze this job posting.  The head of the MegaFon strategy team, most likely a former consultant, posts a vacancy on the concubine site of the consultants.  At the same time, in his opinion, in order to determine the strategy of MegaFon, it‚Äôs enough to stand up for 1.5-2 years <u>in any other</u> office.  But, you know, it is even more preferable to have 1 year <s>of</s> indoctrination <s>work</s> in a branch of a consulting company. <br><br>  Of course, no one's own useful strategy can be formulated.  But he will be an excellent conductor and performer of other people's ideas. <br><br>  And these were the requirements for the "senior analyst."  I am at a loss to imagine who they want to see in the ‚ÄúMegaFon Strategy‚Äù division at the post simply ‚Äúanalyst‚Äù, without the ‚Äúsenior‚Äù prefix.  Maybe a young man without any work experience at all, but with recommendations from ‚Äúhis own‚Äù? <br><br>  However, the topic of this article is the introduction of ideas, not the introduction of people. <br>  About the nuances accompanying the introduction of consultants to the company management, we can talk sometime later. <br><br><a name="p6"></a><h2>  6. Gap feedback from employees to top management </h2><br>  To solve its task of expanding consulting business, consultants should not only strengthen their ties with top management, but also weaken the relationship of top management with the company's own specialists. <br><br>  Ideally, the enterprise should not have its own high-level management specialists. <br><br>  The ‚Äúgolden youth‚Äù is also interested in this, because of its grip in the top management. <br>  So why would the consultants not help them build a system to cut off potential internal competitors?  Such a system and a management style that would squeeze smart employees into foreign companies. <br><br>  In the field of IT, this situation is very bright; top managers speak directly to IT specialists: the situation in the country is difficult, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/301106/">there is no money</a> .  But IT professionals are expected in foreign companies, where the degree of adequacy of management and the internal environment is much higher. <br><br>  When top management, following the advice of consultants, destabilizes the processes in the company, the line management and employees try to mitigate the consequences.  By the way, the consultants call this ‚Äúresistance to change‚Äù or ‚Äúrejection of changes‚Äù, thereby setting a negative label even on constructive criticism in advance. <br><br>  However, still try to get this criticism - as we have already analyzed in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/295314/">Properties of the vertical of power</a> , the distress signal, passing from below to the upper levels of the vertical, softens at every link and turns into ‚Äúeverything as a whole is good‚Äù as a result. <br><br>  Therefore, in order to notice in time that things have already gone wrong, top managers need not only the ability to think for themselves, but also have a feedback channel outside the hierarchy of subordination, through which you can systematically collect and analyze feedback from the professionals of your own company. <br><br>  Such channels of additional feedback are provided for even by legislation - risk management and internal audit.  But they help organize ... the same advice and with such nuances that allow you to block the work of this feedback. <br><br>  The process of stretching the Company on a favorite case-pattern from MBA courses is fraught with the appearance of idiotic (anecdotal, schizophrenic) situations.  Often, employees cannot explain how the idiotic situation will be resolved, the top management cannot go straight ahead - they have not foreseen this situation, and have not worked out solutions for it.  It was smooth on paper, but they forgot about the ravines. <br><br>  Developing a workaround may take several months.  All questions for this period, staff questions to the management "hang in the void" without answers. <br><br>  The unpleasant situation that pushes past MBA managers to limit uncomfortable communication with the ‚Äúbad people‚Äù in favor of communication in the circle of their ‚ÄúTeachers‚Äù, where Spaceships successfully surf the Universe. <br><br>  So the top management is separated from the company's team informationally and psychologically, the real feedback is destroyed in the company. <br><br>  Without adequate feedback, there is no real control.  However, this does not mean that top management loses control over financial outflows. <br><br>  This means that as the system is autonomous from the rest of the company, the top management essentially stops performing functions useful for the life of the company.  Moreover, inevitably begins to harm the useful work that linear management and employees perform. <br><br>  Specific examples will be considered in the second part of the article. <br><br><a name="p7"></a><h2>  7. Noticing traces of negative consequences in reporting </h2><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://hbr-russia.ru/liderstvo/psikhologiya-liderstva/a17082/">If you hired consultants, paid them a lot of money and start complaining that nothing happened, then this is not a question for them, but for you ... I can not complain that the consultants gave me some kind of not such advice.</a>  <a href="http://hbr-russia.ru/liderstvo/psikhologiya-liderstva/a17082/">Well, if it is bad - do not apply.</a>  G. Gref. <br></blockquote><br>  And if the advice is not just advice, but a list of cases about 100% success at 100,500 other enterprises?  How can you resist its <abbr title="the right word for it">implementation</abbr> , if the top management is ‚Äúunanimous for‚Äù, full of enthusiasm, and ‚Äúalways ready‚Äù? <br><br>  Then, when something does not go as well as it was alleged in 100,500 other companies, then who is to blame?  It is clear that inert Krivorukov subordinates who did not grasp the great intention and resist change are in addition not skillful enough and too lazy.  They need to cut the premium. <br><br>  So the chain of reasoning starts from "the case was certainly good," and comes down to the "bad people got." <br><br>  But the premium to lose the desire does not even have a ‚Äúbad people‚Äù, so that the whole Company, with all its might, will seek out the achieved positive effect of the ‚Äúchanges‚Äù, be they wrong. <br><br>  <b>No one inside the affected company is interested in unbiased research and publicizing the consequences of the implementation of the advice of Western consultants.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Instead, the case will be decorated next success</b> . <br><br>  Colleagues tell me: For research, resources are needed, and they were <abbr title="Translated from the innovation of consults means reduced">optimized</abbr> first of all.  In addition, ‚Äúthink‚Äù hired consultants, the rest are supposed to ‚Äúwork‚Äù within their official duties, and, moreover, without asking the authorities uncomfortable questions. <br><br>  And, in turn, top management will rightly judge that there is nothing to spoil your reputation with bad cases, they will have to get a job later in other companies.  In addition, competitors also do not hurt to put in the same position in which they found themselves. <br><br><blockquote>  We have inflated with you - great inflated!  But we, I think, do not want to be the laughing stock of the whole city, so that they scoff at us all their lives.  Here's what: let's get out of here calmly, let's praise the show and fool the whole city!  Then we will all be on equal footing.  So or not? <br>  - Of course, so!  Good judge!  - shouted all in one voice. <br>  <a href="http://old.prosv.ru/ebooks/lib/79_mark_tven_geklberri_finn/12.html">(Mark Twain)</a> . <br></blockquote><br><a name="p8"></a><h2>  8. Difference of medicine from poison </h2><br>  Although I criticized the advice of the consultants all the way, please understand me correctly.  Changes and innovations are often necessary.  (Especially they are necessary after changes made at the prompting of the consultants - it is necessary to correct something spoiled). <br><br>  Therefore, it is not always advisable to completely abandon consultants, since they are one of the sources of information about someone else's experience.  Although it is necessary to remember about the possibility of misinformation, maybe even unintended. <br><br>  The principle here is the same as in the report on scientific research - it begins with a critical review of who did what earlier on this topic. <br><br>  The main thing is to properly use the advice of consultants, so as not to cross the line between medicine and poison. <br><br>  The same idea can be spoiled, and it is possible to improve the situation - it‚Äôs all a matter of implementation nuances. <br><br>  The prevalence of business advice from those who ‚Äúdo not know how to do anything with their hands‚Äù is a long-standing problem and touched us, one might say, the last.  So already the books are written ‚Äúas it is not necessary‚Äù and ‚Äúas it should.‚Äù <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As an example, in the books of E. Goldratt from the ‚ÄúPurpose‚Äù series, the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù consult does not say to the director ‚Äúthey did this, but these things do, and you will make something an average of this.‚Äù The director himself and the employees explore their company, turn on the brain and really think of it, and discover for themselves in their company what they didn‚Äôt know before, or didn‚Äôt notice. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The role of the ‚Äúright‚Äù consultant is, if necessary, to bring to the attention of the director some principles that he did not know due to gaps in his education. Moreover, these principles in fact - the laws of society, nature, or even more so - have the power of mathematical theorems.</font></font> Those.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">things unrelated to random luck, cases of the type " </font></font><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2588%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">survivor's mistake</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> ", or someone's authoritative opinion. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">sequential optimization of the work of each division of a company, and not of the entire company at once, generally leads to a guaranteed non-optimal result</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is a lot of talk about this, </font></font><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/businessstudio/blog/307908/"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">even on Habr√©</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> , but in the form of the opinion of a top manager, even if based on a wealth of experience. But the image of a cut elephant is not proof yet. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For Goldratt, this is proved, even if it is ‚Äúon the fingers‚Äù - in an adapted form, at a level understandable for top managers with knowledge gaps in the exact sciences.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Suppose the general director himself cannot penetrate deeply - there is no time, and the company is too large. How then can he know if there are drawbacks in the activities offered by the consultants? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, he will ask the opinion of his subordinates - top managers, heads of departments. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if the general director leads the consultants and presents them as his friends, superprofessionals in the business world, who will help introduce the best world practices ... Will there then be a free discussion of the shortcomings of the proposals of the consultants? Will any of the top managers dare to criticize the friends of the CEO, and thereby cast a shadow on him? Yes, this stupid case cast aside. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, everything can be much softer than my words, but the essence is - </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">no</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">, no one will a priori look for flaws in the proposals of the consultants. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">To get a free discussion, you need to at least lower the point of contact of the consultants to the level of subordinates of the general director. Who, after receiving advice, should ‚Äúdigest‚Äù them and </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">submit as their own</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is then that the CEO can be an independent arbiter in the process of discussing among the top management the advantages or disadvantages of the proposed measures. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you lower the point of contact with the consultants to a lower level, then when discussing, top managers will no longer criticize each other's proposals, but the proposals of their subordinates. This is even better. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Should discuss:</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Proof (numerical calculations) that the proposed activities will work well in the specific conditions of this company. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Additions and proposals for the adaptation of activities. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Risks and compensating their activities. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Organization of continuous monitoring of the process of change. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Criteria by which it will be possible to judge that things went according to the "bad scenario." </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- Action Plan for the occurrence of a ‚Äúbad scenario‚Äù - a rollback plan. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But if the discussion will be conducted only among those who, like the consultants, (quoting G. Gref) ‚Äúdo it themselves, do not know how to do it themselves,‚Äù there will be no sense. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The "astronauts" should descend from their Cosmos to Earth and discuss their Great Ideas on a Cosmic Scale with those who work, and not hold meetings all day long.</font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The point of contact with the consultants should be in the place where they are able to treat the information from them critically, where they are ready to process it and adapt it to the real nuances of the functioning of a particular Company.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Thus, the normal development of the Company leads to the appearance of its own specialists, who understand all the subtleties of its structure and functioning.

How to harm good advice </font></font></h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, we are in a situation where consultants have a great influence on their clients, but they are not responsible to them for failures in applying their advice. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But it is wrong to assume that they have no responsibility to anyone.
