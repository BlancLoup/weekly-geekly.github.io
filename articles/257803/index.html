  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Another attempt to interest students</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I work as an informatics teacher in one of Kharkov lyceums.  A year and a half ago, I looked at the Coursera course on Gamification, and set about trying to apply something similar in my room.  I wanted to make some element of the game in the assessment of students and, thereby, increase their interest in learning.  I want to immediately share with you the results of the project - all this has been working for a little over a year and has quite well established itself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So what actually did.  I decided to create a website where each student will be able to see his grades, but these will be not just dry numbers, but something more.  The basis of the creation formed the following ideas: <br><br><ol><li>  The modern grading system assumes that each child does not know anything until he proves the opposite, that is, until he has received any marks, his total score for the topic is zero.  I decided that this is not very fair for children, especially since it contradicts the presumption of innocence recognized all over the world.  And I decided that let every child know everything perfectly well until he proves the opposite.  In practice, it looks like this - suppose a student has to get 5 assessments in the process of studying a topic, in the usual case, instead of each of the assessments, there is a zero (empty cell), which will later be filled with other assessments; in Ukraine, a 12-point grading system), which will subsequently be replaced by the child‚Äôs grades.  In the first case, even if a student receives 5 (approximately 3 in a 5-point system), then his final grade increases from zero upwards, in my case, his final grade begins to decline from 12 down.  On the site, the child can constantly monitor how each new grade he receives affects his future thematic score.  Also, my theory is based on the assurances of psychologists that it is much more painful for a person to lose than to receive less.  (Foolish thoughts of children, that now if you don‚Äôt receive any grades, then eventually 12 will be cruelly broken by the teacher‚Äôs iron hand, that is me, because at the end of the topic all the missing grades are replaced by 2 points. Not counting cases , then the number of his ratings in the subject is simply reduced to the number of practical classes that he attended.) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7c/205/3cc/c7c2053cceee91eee87387b36d35268d.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f49/1ee/d8b/f491eed8b7db1bd2aa14daa8f7d7916e.png" alt="image"><br></li><li>  Anything can be done better by adding virtual achievements and achievements there.  Children especially like these not very pedagogical ones (but I don‚Äôt even have a pedagogical education), but very dear achievements to my heart, like ‚ÄúSmart Boy of the Week‚Äù and ‚ÄúNumb of the Week‚Äù:

With the help of NetDuino + NFCreader, the access system was implemented into the office to track attendance.  For identification, metro cards are used, in Kharkov they are, as in Moscow, with an NFC chip, so they are ideal for this.  At the same time, in order to motivate children to celebrate, a rule was introduced that those who visited more than 85% of the lessons in the subject receive an additional +1 mark on the thematic assessment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/0fe/429/250/0fe4292508e7603e764d2f681032c43b.png" alt="image"><br></li><li>  Any project needs a talisman or totem animal, and let it be Raving Rabbid. </li></ol><br><br>  The result was such a small saytik, where I tried to make the most accessible and fun to implement all my ideas.  Work on the site is ongoing, children are happy to use the site, both in order to find out their grades, and in order to measure achievements with classmates.  I can not say that from the first day they started using it with pleasure, for the first couple of months the implementation was rather tight, but then the charms of high technologies did prevail.  In addition, students often offer new ideas and improvements, some of which have been implemented.  Therefore, if any of you also have any ideas or suggestions that can be added to make it more fun, more interesting and more exciting, do not hesitate and share your thoughts. <br><br>  PS If this has meaning and interest for someone, then everything is written with Python + Django + Bootstrap. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257803/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257803/</a></p>
