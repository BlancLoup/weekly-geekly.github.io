  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Say a good word about high salary</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  Epigraph: My salary is good, but small! </blockquote><br>  Looking at how they appear and disappear in the drafts, along with comments and discussions of the article on hiring and retaining employees, I also decided to take a chance. <br>  I want to argue with the thesis that money does not motivate and express my arguments in favor of a high patch. <br>  Here are the theses that I want to reveal a little more in the article. <br>  1. High salary does not motivate.  But low wages demotivates by itself. <br>  2. The high salary is sobering, because you understand well that there will be those who will quickly find such a position. <br>  3. High salary makes it difficult to move to another place. <br><br>  It is possible to argue a lot about the fact that a wealthy person can develop harmoniously, that he feels in demand and valuable, that it encourages an employer to do a really useful job, increase efficiency, etc. <br>  But these three theses, in my opinion, work mathematically simple, directly and effectively.  Without blah blah blah.  Especially the latter - it is the most powerful. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We introduce the notation: OT - ‚Äúhigh salary‚Äù.  NZ - "low salary." <br><br><h4>  Assumption </h4><br>  Yes, let's immediately agree that OT itself does not solve the problems of motivation.  But she is one of the tools.  And each manager solves a complex system of equations with many unknowns, establishing a unique balance of factors in the company, including salary and so on.  Obviously, each tool requires certain costs.  And the manager for his business solves the problem of maximizing profits, <b>sometimes</b> by minimizing the total cost of establishing a balance.

    <h4>  High wages are cheaper. * </h4><br>  It was I who paraphrased the thesis that the NC is an independent demotivating factor. <br>  Indeed, the sun quickly becomes familiar and does not inspire every morning to go to the "daily metro apocalypse."  It's true.  But even more true, NZ demotivates by itself.  Unlike the OT, the awareness of the NT is in the head for much longer and produces negative sensations, including subconscious ones.  Minimal additional negative circumstances are enough to reduce mood and, consequently, performance. <br>  NT is a subconscious excuse for not strain more than you think is necessary, in order to sacrifice quality if necessary.  And sometimes, if this is a DHS, then just say in person: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm paid not so much to ...‚Äù, well, then something else I want to refuse. <br>  And the most important thing: if an employee knows that he is paid less than the market average (SZ), he is ready to make an effort and go to where the OT is. <br>  By the way, as we recently found out, it is possible to break a match exactly in the middle, but with a probability tending to zero.  That‚Äôs exactly why NW cannot be obtained.  We will be aware of it either as NZ or as OT. <br><br>  As a result, we have: <br>  - reduced motivation (it can be raised by other means, but it is also worth the money) <br>  - increased staff turnover <br>  - increased risks <br>  What is more profitable: to pay a little higher than the market, or to constantly search for and train new employees and beat those who have to work? <br>  Do not rush to answer, this task has different solutions in different conditions.  Recall a joke about a bear and guest workers. <br>  * &lt;the smallest font&gt; in a limited non-zero set of possible applications &lt;/ the smallest font&gt; <br><br><h4>  High salary sobering </h4><br>  And both sides.  Rather, three.  (Actually - four). <br><br>  So, the employer begins to appreciate the work of the employee with the OT.  And tries not to entrust him with any garbage.  And even respect the employee.  And there are many other positive points.  No, we will not consider the case of natural monopolies of power, where they can pay a lot and wipe their feet.  On this subject there is an extension of Pelevin's lemma about clown and homosexuals. <br><br>  Worker.  The employee begins to appreciate the place of work.  And with respect to work, to business, to the company, to all of these <br>  to people who are doing some business, as a result of which so much money is allocated for IT. <br>  And he also understands that there are certainly people behind the gates who are willing to work for this salary.  What if the company tolerates your shoals, it is only in the hope that you will correct, and not sit on the neck.  And that the employer has the right to demand good work for good money. <br><br>  OT allows you to set high requirements for candidates.  And the candidate will reach the appropriate. <br><br>  Fourth side?  I literally have a couple of lines.  This side is the industry as a whole.  High salaries make her be efficient.  That is why they conclude secret agreements about non-hiring, about restraining wages, that they killed Kenny and transferred interesting articles to a draft.  They want to pay little and carry out motivation trainings to find performers for boring work. <br><br><h4>  Hard to find a salary more </h4><br>  This is not even a plus.  This is such a powerful tool that it is already a minus. <br>  Because even realizing that it‚Äôs time to change jobs, that a recession in development has begun, and even stagnation, you cannot find another job simply because they pay less everywhere.  You just work here, as the author dreamed of in a non-existent article about a poorly dressed programmer, doing your usual work well and waiting for years for the best offer, and these bastards every year promote you and increase your salary, so that communication with recruiters often ends when discussing the minimum desired salary </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167449/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167449/</a></p>
