Despite the fact that Advertisers and Marketers have already realized quite well the importance of this technology, the number of Brands that actually buy mobile advertising programmatic in a way is still <a href="http://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/03/30/few-marketers-buying-mobile-ads-programmatically-despite-its-perceived-importance">insignificant</a> .

      Studies indicate that in advertising campaigns it is necessary to use different formats of advertisements in order to reduce CPM (show prices).  This means that we must move away from the traditional forms of advertising, which do not involve interaction with users.  In fact, campaigns that post the three most commonly used ad formats are CPM almost 50% cheaper than those that use only one 300x250 size.  Campaigns that use all seven banner formats have a CPM of 60% less.  This underlines the need for diversity, and high-end advertising campaigns that can realize the full potential of mobile programmatic. <br><br>  In addition, it is very important to build a campaign programmatic creatively, which means using the <b>data</b> available in the mobile programmatic to create customized ads aimed at the target audience.  For example, take into account gender, behavioral characteristics of consumers of advertising.  Unfortunately, nowadays, many Companies neglect to do this, and as a result get a low ROI.  This happens because Companies still use slow, manual methods and they simply lack the resources to create an advertising campaign with a large number of creative formats and target groups. <br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/byyd/blog/17806/">Viewability is</a> also a very important factor.  Some researchers argue that only half of all advertisements, the display of which is bought by the programmatic method, are in the eyes of the target audience.  Concerns about this phenomenon are increasingly heard from practitioners who use these technologies, who want to be assured of transparency, and understand the fair value of advertising. <br><br>  <b>The future of mobile programmatic</b> <br><br>  Mobile advertising program is constantly evolving.  This means that there are constantly new exchanges and markets that conduct various purchases, sales, and even creative configurations for participants in the process.  In the future, the volume and type of <b>data</b> available for targeting and distributing advertising sites will only grow.  And Technologies will be able to better track user behavior, social media activity and process location data. <br><br>  It is also expected that investments in content management systems and campaigns will lead to the emergence of platforms that can link various advertising campaigns and workflows together.  This will create a centralized and almost fully automated system that will increase the effectiveness of mobile advertising programmatic, and also allow users to associate various resources with data together to highlight relevant information such as CPM and the overall impact of an advertising campaign on various demographic groups. <br><br>  It is expected that a similar concept will become more widespread in the creative process of programmatic, which will automate various aspects of the creation of creativity and its management through a centralized system.  This will all reduce the need for additional programming and changing the scale and size of advertisements, and allow the ad to be flexible and adaptive. <br><br>  Finally, ad exchanges and inventories will look for the possibility of including information on viewability in the auction trading process in the future to assure buyers that they can now better measure and understand how many times the ad has been shown to the target audience. <br><br>  As you can see, mobile programmatic advertising is growing rapidly and rapidly, but there are still some difficulties. <br><br>  To summarize, we now know: <br><br><ul><li>  That there are various types of mobile adware programs available to you; </li><li>  How Advertisers can create effective and optimized advertising campaigns using this technology; </li><li>  What data is available to you to accurately target and re-target your audience and increase your ROI; </li><li>  On the problems of viewability and creation of creatives, which so far prevent the disclosure of the full potential of new technologies; </li><li>  How much creativity in programmatic is important and how it creates the prerequisites for the development of this technology. </li></ul><br><br>  There is no doubt about the power and prospects of this technology.  The only question is what and how you will do with the help of these tools in order to help your business grow, and bring your potential customers information about your product / service. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292964/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292964/</a></p>
