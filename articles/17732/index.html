  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three Little Pigs 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once three pigs decided to create a startup. <br><br>  The piglets were young, but very advanced, one might say, arrogant (affected by the experience of dealing with recruitment agencies, where the piglets newly released from almasvinka were lured to all sorts of grain positions - in campomos and in Ostankino, and where they didn‚Äôt call).  But the pigs had heard about combines like svinbos and lyuhsvina, where normal pigs are turned into siemmeynoe meat, and, having familiarized themselves with the situation on the market, they decided that they were no worse than any kind of bryns and mordoknig. <br><br>  The names of the pigs Poh-Poh, Nah-Nah and Naf-Naf.  They read the classics about the three piglets 1.0, so they decided to build a startup together, and divide only the shares.  At first they wanted to divide the shares 33-33-33, and give the future investor 1%, but, having visited the investment section at izdef, they nevertheless decided that the venture capital volchars also need something, and they divided the shares 20-20-20 and 30 (it was not without an easy scuffle between Nah-Nah and Naf-Naf. Poh-Poh, as always, was calm for an understandable reason, thanks to which he got his name). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Having finished with the distribution of future incomes, they bought a domain (8d / year) for piglets. Com, hosting (3d / month), put shims (0d) there, well, and wrote a huge list of the merits of their project (a copy of the article from the web page about the web20).  And for some time they calmed down: Naf-Naf, he sat down to look at the comparative analyzes of the merits of modern off-road vehicles, Nah-Nah plunged into WoW, and Poh-Poh looked through fresh pig meat.

      Suddenly someone knocked to them. <br>  - Who's there?  - asked Naf-naf? <br>  - This is me - a venture investor. <br>  - Whats up? <br>  - I want to give money. <br>  - Lot? <br>  - well, so ... tysch 100. <br>  Piglets rolled along the floor: <br>  - Ha ha ha!  What are you venture, you're a typical angel!  Vali otsedova! <br>  The old wolf (and this was it) trampled offended and left. <br><br>  Piglets meanwhile ran for pizza (EU, vegetarian), put on a hosting wiki (wiki! Wiki! Wiki! Wiki! - Nah-Nah grunted ridiculously during team building exercises), blogs, photo hosting and personalization (in fact they just stole the php script from the google sandbox, but it all looked very cool).  Poh-Poh posted his institute photos of mud games with Yum-Yum (an honoring student in pig studies, by the way) on the forum, and sent a contact list, resulting in as many as 200 people registered in pigs.  Tykh-Pykh, once a janitor, and now a well-known journalist, whom Yum-Yum had once rejected, wrote an article to Swinward Magazine about a new word in pig.  A number of experts predicted a boom and estimated the capitalization of piglets. In 5 billion acorns and predicted an increase of 988768.9%.  After 3 days, 20,000 users already registered on the pigs, and the tariff plan had to be upgraded to 9.99 / month. <br><br>  A knock on the door again. <br>  ‚ÄúGuys, this is me again,‚Äù Wolf seems to have read a number of articles and got better acquainted with the financial prospects of the piglets. I have ten million here ... <br>  ‚ÄúNalom ?,‚Äù Nah-Nah said sternly, ‚Äúotherwise, <br>  ‚ÄúNalom, of course, nalom,‚Äù the wolf began to fuss.  - Fresh, just out of the pipe, even a little more of oil smell ... <br><br>  And the work began to boil.  The first thing is the frames, of course.  Naf-Naf telephoned his friends, system administrators and programmers, Nah-Nah - his friends, managers and secretaries, and Poh-Poh spent days on the phone with Nyam-Nyam, allegedly discussing the incredible PR campaign "Trough as a gift", but in fact indulging in dirty nostalgic novel.  Attracted by extreme programming, fashionable terms, and free acorns, people were just eager to work in piglets. <br><br>  The wolf occasionally looked at their office, saw rows of tails sunk into the sky, and calling back a portfolio investor (according to rumors, there was a certain Medved behind all this), soothingly whispered into the phone ‚Äúthe forecast of the ebitda was increased ... yes, three hundred percent ... I am absolutely sure‚Äù ... then he hung up and sat for a long time on a chair in the corner, looking at the young and pink piglets, who continually scurried to the machine with free water and acorns, laughed and exchanged various dumb jokes.  All this frustrated him, the piglets looked too young, too incomprehensible ... to calm down, he reread the articles in the Swipe and read the reviews on the Kabanwick ... and also looked at the screen with a confident upward schedule of attendance. <br><br>  In the meantime, the piglets removed a Class A office in the very center of the hub squad and organized a continuous supply and deployment of new servers, and also opened a round-the-clock campus with free Himalayan water and Chilean acorns, which served broken sows. <br><br>  The old wolf sold its shares to Medved Group.  At parting, he shook hands with Nah-Nahu and the rest for a long time, said ‚Äúoh, I remember in the forest, it happened, you go for the diskettes ...‚Äù, and got drunk terribly at the banquet. <br><br>  In OAO Medved-groups there were serious guys who did not descend to visit the office of pigs.  They sometimes came from auditors who had a long conversation in the office with Poh-Poh (who became vice president of investments) and listened to the presentations of Naf-Nafa, who became vice president of marketing, with serious people.  And Nah-Nah was driving sales (it seems he was selling advertising ... at least he said so) ... <br><br>  A year later, Porosyatniki.com entered the IPO at the London farm itself.  Nah-Nah flew like a madman on his jet to London and back, the auditors from SvinDety-HouseSuper dug their noses under all the oaks, but everything went well ... <br><br>  Many of the workers, especially those who started in the first pigsty, sold their options and became millionaires and fell back into the Tambov province.  There they hired experienced wolves by drivers and wrote out the best French food and young pigs for training their boar sons in decent manners. <br><br>  After a scandal with a young piggy secretary, Nah-Nah left the company and went to work with suppliers of spoiled apples, where he often personally inspected the process of biting and inspired the youth with a personal example.  Naf-Naf wrote the book ‚ÄúTrue road, or you Nafig‚Äù and traveled to the pigsty of different countries with the mission of goodwill, and Poh-Poh became interested in Zen and personally talked with the Dalai Kaban himself about the meaning of life.  Here is a story. <br><br>  Do you feel the fairy tale turned out too kind?  Until now, they have not eaten anyone ... <br><br>  - The author seems to be <a href="http://ibsurgeon.blogspot.com/2007/12/20.html">here</a> . <br>  And taken <a href="http://barsum.livejournal.com/235543.html">there</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17732/</a></p>
