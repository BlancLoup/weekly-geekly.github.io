In the spring of this year, SAP released the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS - a set of tools for building enterprise applications that combine the requirements of the corporate environment and application standards for iOS. <br>  In several posts in our blog, we will talk about the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS, what features and services it supports, and how it helps mobile application developers to speed up the preparation and launch of corporate applications for iOS. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/fa2/396/0da/fa23960da4814c3c8e57574adb308729.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>A brief FAQ about what is the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS:</b> <b><br></b> <br>  <i>1. What is the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS?</i> <i><br></i>  This SDK is a set of iOS frameworks developed for Swift.  It should help developers create, extend, and launch a new class of native enterprise iOS applications using the SAP Cloud Platform and its services. <br><br>  <i>2. What does the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS include?</i> <i><br></i>  The SDK includes several development blocks, including Fiori user interface elements for the iOS design language (for example, controls), UI models, templates, access to backend services, simplified access to iOS features and device functions, etc.

      <i>3. How can I use the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS?</i> <i><br></i>  The main scenarios for using the new SDK are the development of mobile applications for working with S / 4HANA, for local SAP software (on-premise), extensions for the SAP Cloud Platform, or custom iOS applications based on the SAP Cloud Platform. <br><br>  <i>4. How does the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS differ from other existing mobile SDKs?</i> <i><br></i>  The new SDK is fully developed in the modern programming language Apple - Swift.  It contains a set of replaceable frameworks with which the developer can select the necessary functions of the application.  It also has a set of user interface components for developing corporate iOS applications.  The SDK allows you to connect new mobile services to the SAP Cloud Platform to the application. <br><br>  <i>5. How does the new SDK help developers use the new Fiori design principles for iOS?</i> <br>  The SDK includes user interface components that match the design language of iOS.  Using these components, developers simplify the process of creating native iOS applications. <br><br>  <i>6. Do I need to be a SAP Cloud Platform user to use the iOS SDK?</i> <i><br></i>  To use this SDK, you need a basic or trial account from the SAP Cloud Platfrom.  The SAP Cloud Platform is an open platform that supports connections to other systems (from SAP or not from SAP).  For example, you can safely connect to your local SAP Business Suite product package through the SAP Cloud Platform Connector. <br><br>  <i>7. Is it possible to free download the SAP Cloud Platform SDK to test the development and launch of applications?</i> <br>  The trial version of the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS is available for download <a href="https://www.sap.com/developer/topics/cloud-platform-sdk-for-ios.html">here</a> . <br><br>  <i>8.What functions for enterprise applications are supported in the SDK?</i> <i><br></i>  The SDK supports all the features that are needed for an enterprise mobile application.  Among them: authentication, authorization, access to secure data storage, selection of configurations for access to the server, as well as integration with specialized functions of iOS. <br><br>  <i>9. What about SAP-supported mobile apps for Android and Microsoft?</i> <i><br></i>  We continue to support other mobile platforms, including Google and Microsoft.  Working with Apple is a step towards helping developers create a new class of enterprise applications for iOS.  To support the development of mobile applications for other operating systems, you can still use the SAP Mobile Platform in both onprem mode and the cloud version, as an SAP Cloud Platfrom service. <br><br>  <b>What else is included in the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS.</b> <br><br>  To work with our SDK you need to know about several key things: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS Assistant application <br>  ‚Ä¢ A set of frameworks <br>  ‚Ä¢ Fiori controls for iOS <br>  ‚Ä¢ SAP Fiori for iOS Mentor application <br>  ‚Ä¢ Offline mode <br>  ‚Ä¢ Push notifications <br>  ‚Ä¢ Register and track messages in the application. <br><br>  <i>SCP SDK for iOS Assistant</i> is a Mac application that helps you quickly generate Swift object-oriented proxy classes for OData services to reduce dependency on low-level APIs.  The assistant also helps generate mobile service configurations and projects in Xcode, ready for launch on an iPhone or iPad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bad/852/a52/bad852a525c2459f87f9e7ac85d64823.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>A set of frameworks in the SDK</i> .  The <a href="https://help.sap.com/doc/978e4f6c968c4cc5a30f9d324aa4b1d7/Latest/en-US/Documents/Frameworks/SAPFoundation/index.html">SAPFoundation</a> and <a href="https://help.sap.com/doc/978e4f6c968c4cc5a30f9d324aa4b1d7/Latest/en-US/Documents/Frameworks/SAPCommon/index.html">SAPCommon frameworks</a> include components that integrate the application with the SAP Cloud Platform mobile service.  Here we help developers to simplify the connection of authentication, logging, push-notifications, network connection, etc.  There are several tutorials on configuring authentication and logging in to the SAP global site. <br><br>  In addition to a set of frameworks, we also added <i><a href="https://help.sap.com/doc/978e4f6c968c4cc5a30f9d324aa4b1d7/Latest/en-US/Documents/Frameworks/SAPFiori/index.html">Fiori for iOS</a></i> controls to the SDK.  The idea is to help developers speed up the process of preparing a mobile application: we provide a set of controls that complement existing iOS native controls and at the same time meet the standards of the corporate environment.  As a result, developers can save time and reinvent the wheel.  Also, the SAPFiori frameworks allow you to change standard and custom control elmenets.  Thus, with just a few lines of code, the developer can change the look and feel of the application, without having to change each control manually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1cd/6fa/e60/1cd6fae60c4d4213b97fc74b9cc98329.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>SAP Fiori for iOS Mentor</i> is an iPad application where you can test controls, UI, and other available Fiori components.  With the help of the application, you can also explore and select all possible options, as well as generate ready-for-use snippets with a code in which your settings will be selected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f2f/c1b/369/f2fc1b36974b4c7fbad90ee9ac356a08.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/e50/3ad/4ed/e503ad4ed5e94c5596f344d0ab217860.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Offline mode</i> .  The SDK and mobile backend services support offline mode or online mode using a single SDK.  Object-oriented APIs for data services are generated via backend services.  Synchronization with an encrypted mobile database is optimized in order to effectively synchronize only the changed data.  The synchronization engine caches results, as well as groups and compresses large updates, supports resolution of version conflicts. <br><br>  <i>Push notifications</i> .  With the help of notifications, users will be able to receive notifications when a new information becomes available in the application.  The service works through the REST API and using simple integration with the Apple push notification service (APNs).  You can target notifications by device, application, list or group of users.  Among the available message types are banners, sounds, and more. <br><br>  <i>Register and track messages in the application</i> .  This function allows you to register messages with different levels of severity: depending on location, to allow or not to allow downloading one or several files from the user without interacting with the SAP Cloud Platform. <br><br>  <i>Useful links:</i> <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://training.sap.com/shop/learning/journey/sap-fiori-for-ios---mobile-developer">Training materials for mobile developers on SAP Fiori</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://experience.sap.com/fiori-design-ios/">SAP Fiori Design service guidelines</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://store.sap.com/sap/cpa/ui/resources/store/html/SolutionDetails.html%3Fpid%3D0000014485">Free trial of the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS in the SAP Store</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorial-navigator/mobile-interactive-tutorials.html">Interactive educational materials</a> <br><br>  In the following posts we will talk more about how to run and test the SAP Cloud Platform SDK for iOS, about the available services and integrations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/333802/">https://habr.com/ru/post/333802/</a></p>
