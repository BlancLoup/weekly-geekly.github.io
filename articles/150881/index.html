How many did not search, and did not find the full, step by step instructions. <br>  Therefore, I write myself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/169/25f/c0a/16925fc0a6ca38b08143331b5ea701da.jpg"><br><br>  <b><font color="#cc0000">ATTENTION!</font></b>  <b>All of the following is a de jure violation of the laws of the Russian Federation and Ukraine, and is generally an invention of the author and the fruit of work in Photoshop.</b>  <b>Applying the described in practice, you act at your own peril and risk, and neither the author, nor the site administration is responsible for your actions.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  Go to <a href="https://share.payoneer.com/nav/VVv3d3nxu59IfDMg2-rBC7Q5ZhkiW7i3Ui0DKsANUUksmGdv0mmAa8ygyQSsI0khzXe-6QX_o7q8-sdRgEEvFA2">Payoneer</a> , and press the big <b>Sing Up</b> button <b>!</b>  .

    </li><li>  We are waiting for the card.  I came from Ukraine in two weeks.  Comes in a regular envelope.  Sending a card is free.  In a piece of paper 3 times it is written that the card must be activated, we will not object.  Go to <a href="http://share.payoneer-affiliates.com/a/clk/4pFs2s">Payoneer</a> , click <b>Activate your Card</b> : <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/q8vmq4cqJk-Q5SWWOEe_17PBBy9G7mSaYdnA5b4aEMo%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cd/f3e/76e/2cdf3e76e2ea7d35f23da888f2400ac3.jpg" height="405" width="640"></a> <br>  Log in, drive in the card number.  We come up with a pin code.  Everything, the card is active.  But there is little point in this. <br><br></li><li>  We write to the mail support.ru@payoneer.com a letter of the following content (available in Russian): <br>  <b>I ask to include on the account (your mail) card (number) US Payment Service</b> <br>  You will receive a standard letter of opportunity, and will be asked to send: <br><ol><li>  What services or products do you offer (please, if available, provide links to relevant websites)? <br>  <b>I wrote a sale on ebay.</b> </li><li>  Please provide us with links to websites displaying product samples, online resources, or services offered by you.  Please make sure that the links you provide mention your name or show your attitude to the goods / services offered. <br>  <b>Gave a link to a couple of lots.</b> </li><li>  Please send us screenshots of your account on the company's website from which you intend to receive payments (for example, PayPal, Amazon, Skrill, etc.).  The screenshot should contain your name and balance on the account. <br>  <b>Sent a screenshot of the paypal with the amount.</b> </li><li>  Please provide a copy of your photo ID.  This may be your driver's license, passport or passport.  If the documents are not in English, then we prefer a copy of the passport.  You can scan / take a picture of your ID and attach the received scan / picture to your reply to this message.  Please send copies of both sides of the document where necessary.  We prefer JPEG files up to 1 MB. <br>  <b>Russian passport came up, one turn.</b> </li></ol><br>  Replies duplicated in English. <br><br></li><li>  After a while (a couple of days), if everything was done correctly, the following letter would be e-mail: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/6sTdpehE2UwIKnC5XnzIC7PBBy9G7mSaYdnA5b4aEMo%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bc/2d9/a7c/0bc2d9a7c3d44a6e683d08e87c5174f6.png" height="532" width="640"></a> <br>  This means that you now have a US bank account tied to your card. <br>  <b>ACCOUNT #: 4013435566876 ABA - #: 062120184</b> <br>  These two numbers are your account. <br><br></li><li>  Login to PayPal account, click "Withdraw funds" (Withdraw), in the future I will write an English version. <br>  Offer to add Bank Account, agree.  Fill in the sample: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ogLP-qhPh_sjSkr8lhGOzLPBBy9G7mSaYdnA5b4aEMo%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dc4/e83/cfe/dc4e83cfeedcba0be912e7365c6b6af2.png" height="508" width="640"></a> <br>  The numbers should be yours, but if you fill mine, I will not be offended.  Bank Name - <b>First Century Bank, Account Type -</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Checking</b> (checking account).  I chose savings, and everything works, but still - in the letter above type is indicated. <br>  Some companies, for example Odesk ask the name of the city - "Commerce" <br>  If you have lost the details of the letter, you can always find the <b>Services - US Payment Service on the Payoneer website.</b> <br><br></li><li>  Everything, in a stick, click <b>Withdraw - Withdraw funds to your bank account</b> , enter the amount, <b>Continue</b> . <br>  <b>3-4 Business Days</b> means exactly 3-4 days, no more and no less.  With the exception of non-working days, but there are <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ru/cgi-bin/webscr%3Fcmd%3D_display-withdrawal-availability%26display_eft_availability_country%3DUS">only 10 of</a> them per year.  We have a new year more rest. <br>  From the paper, the money will go away: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/-PWD1XINGx-QbUUAk7t2obPBBy9G7mSaYdnA5b4aEMo%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e05/ed2/c0f/e05ed2c0ffce34413a8cc3447f84d2d5.jpg" height="307" width="640"></a> </li><li>  We are waiting for 3-4 days, after that the money will come to Payoneer, and a letter will fall on the mail: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ZVWv7-99jnsTuwDcUCIKFbPBBy9G7mSaYdnA5b4aEMo%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/166/9ee/477/1669ee4779b728c58e99c29e330d06be.jpg" height="409" width="640"></a> <br><br></li><li>  On the account, however, less will fall: from $ 1018 on the account it turned out $ 978, $ 40 was lost. <br>  Of these, $ 30 is the annual maintenance of the card, which is debited with the first deposit, and $ 10 is the payoneer commission.  This is only 1%: <br> <a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/RTpFABFOvLG9IpM7n-8dbrPBBy9G7mSaYdnA5b4aEMo%3Ffeat%3Dembedwebsite"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c1/da4/b92/9c1da4b9235db4b661f48117a7a77417.jpg" height="216" width="640"></a> <br><br></li><li>  After that, go to any ATM, and remove the money.  Each request (for withdrawal, even if there is no money, or a balance check) costs $ 1, and $ 2.15 is the withdrawal itself. <br>  Those.  if you request the wrong amount, $ 1 will be written off from you, and if the right amount is $ 3.15, consider this and take a little less. <br>  Take off in those ATMs where there are dollars, then they can be changed in the bank with the most favorable rate, and not at the rate of the ATM with rubles.  And when withdrawing in a currency other than the official currency of the country, the bank has the right to charge a commission.  It is better to check on a small amount, or call the bank if it is critical. <br>  By the way, purchases from the card are free, but when paying in rubles, the conversion is carried out by the bank - the owner of the terminal. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150881/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150881/</a></p>
