In order to separate the patties from the flies. <br><br>  For whom renting places in <a href="http://www.communist.cc/">Communist Loft</a> <b>makes no sense:</b> <br><br>  - <strong>Freelancers without a company.</strong>  Why spend money on the office, if there is a house and a cafe in case of a meeting with customers?  They will understand everything, because they hired a freelancer as a cheap alternative to ordering in a company.  On the contrary for the customer - the presence of a private office in a freelancer is an unkind sign that prices will soon rise and will have to look for another artist. <br>  In case of impossibility of working at home (for example, having small children) or the need to work in a team of freelancers, the best way out is to rent an apartment.  Fortunately, prices have now plummeted, and you can even sleep and spend the night in such an office.

      - <strong>Companies whose business does not require any respectability.</strong>  For example, for an online store, it is important to be in direct accessibility to the warehouse, but it does not matter what the office looks like and where it is located.  The same applies to all companies whose clients do not appear in the contractor‚Äôs office before signing budgets. <br>  Here the best way out is to rent a room in an unreconstructed scientific research institute, which still remain even in considerable proximity to the garden ring. <br><br>  - <strong>Companies whose mental comfort of employees does not affect their performance.</strong>  Or in the case when employees simply do not care what kind of environment to work productively.  This is the case of wholesalers of gas valves, pumping equipment, clothing and other industrial crap.  Their path also lies in the research institute on the Moscow Ring Road.  Surrounded by similar employees of such companies feel like a fish in water.  But the inconvenience of their location does not frighten them - they still often get to work by train from the near and far suburbs. <br><br>  - <strong>Companies that have more than 8 people and have long-term confidence in their own future.</strong>  Yes, 6X500 is $ 4000.  To date, the amount for which you can rent a small (from 80 meters) decent office in a normal area.  But.  Let's not forget about the arrangement (10-15 kilobasks, in the presence of jobs - reception, negotiation, Wi-Fi, printers, etc. office crap) and a penalty for rent breaks.  Therefore, to rent such an office without clear prospects for the coming year is stupid. <br><br>  Representatives of these 4 types of companies are often alarming me when they are interested in the terms of rent in Communist Loft.  Because either they do not count their own forces, or simply want to pay for what they do not need. <br><br>  Who are we waiting for: <br><br>  <strong>- Companies whose nature of business presupposes an office and its respectable appearance.</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  <strong>- Companies whose performance depends on the quality of the atmosphere of the working space.</strong>  <strong>Often these are intellectual and creative businesses.</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  <strong>- Companies that are inconvenient to show customers their volume of 2-5 people.</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  <strong>- Companies that are important to stay in the organizational form of companies, and not to become free producers "home" with a registered legal entity.</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  <strong>- Companies that soberly assess the prospects for the development of the economy are not confident in the long-term future of their market.</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  <strong>- Project teams whose work regime requires a comfortable and at the same time free environment around.</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>- And, of course, start-up projects, whose nature of business implies one or more of the above conditions.</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  I hope all questions are covered.  ;) <br>  Thanks friends! <br><br>  And as a bonus of the photo process, in the "was / became" mode: <br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ae/624/77d/2ae62477d7c4592fbe6674bb12349c66.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54240/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54240/</a></p>
