  <section class="page js-page"><h1>+1 to the evolution of a freelancer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://alexgo.ru/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/freelance.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  Gathered a small list of points of evolution of a freelancer, each +1 will make you more productive or more expensive in the market. <br>  The list is taken from my life, I have been a freelance practitioner for a year, I have never left Russia before, I visited 9 countries last year, and I hope to visit 20 more next year. <br><br>  1) Never forget anything.  To do this, I always add every small task to miniplan.ru and I will always receive a letter or text message at the right time, all completely free. <br>  2) Self-awareness.  When you work without a direct boss, when the salary is not twice / once a month, you need to realize your life as much as possible, understand how you work, how you get money, whether you are hiring, what you are striving for.  If in ordinary life you can go with the flow, then freelance will open the doors of conscious life for you. <br>  3) Rest.  There is no employer, and you yourself should take care of your vacation, make it so that it is more than if you worked in direct employment.  Do not forget about breaks in work.  Rest will make you more productive or absolutely relax and self-awareness will help you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  4) Morning exercises.  It will make you more cheerful, and a cup of coffee with a tasty bun will give you energy to work until dinner. <br>  5) Give up social networks and watching movies and TV shows.  A waste of time if you are a free freelancer, look at the world alive, and not through the lens of VKontakte and cinema.  * Pornocasts are not counted.

      6) Document everything.  I document everything about projects, access, infrastructure description, hacks, bugs and much more.  This is where google docs and wiki should help you. <br>  7) Start a project management system.  I work in asana, trello, basecamp, megaplan, jira and other systems with customers.  For myself, I chose redmine, opensource is the most functional of opensource and closest to my requests.  I would take saas, but there are a lot of projects like hired people and saas will come out very expensive, but my friend works alone and uses jira on demand for $ 10. <br>  8) Use the code version control system.  Now in my opinion the most profitable for a freelancer will be the study of git and github.  The other day I tried to explain about the advantages of version control to one freelancer, he works alone and only on small projects, I could not explain to him. <br>  9) Learn to manage your time.  I used the method of full daytime distribution here, a couple of months of torment, and I already control the time automatically and I don‚Äôt need to distribute it in the morning. <br>  10) Work in pairs.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/154181/">habrahabr.ru/post/154181</a> <br><br>  11) Hire other freelancers in areas where you are weak.  For example, a web programmer hires a layout designer all the time, and another one has to hire a designer all the time. <br>  12) Be brave.  Freelance itself is not very stable and not everyone can work like that.  Do not be afraid to tell the customer that you do not have time on time, you cannot do it, suggest solutions (you have not thought that there may be solutions?). <br>  13) Be responsible.  Frequently, freelancers simply disappear, for completely different reasons, from the birth of a child to just tired.  Be responsible and do not disappear, or at least have the courage to say that your son was born and you will not be able to work. <br>  14) Financial discipline.  Keep track of income and expenses, analyze what you spend, optimize costs, maybe you spend too much on customized pizza, and you should spend it on a couple of weeks in the United Arab Emirates. <br>  15) Have the opportunity to accept or pay money in any way.  I currently support: webmoney (the most popular method of payment for services I buy from Russian freelancers), yandex money (hello to Yandex who recently blocked my account and lost my fraud ticket, and six months later said no such ticket, start a new one, but he did nothing new), bank transfer in Russia, gold crown transfers, skrill / moneybookers, paypal, transfers in foreign banks, mobile top-ups. <br><br>  16) Determine the purpose of your work.  My goal is to provide top-quality services in administration, optimization of hosting, clouds and high-load systems.  And for what purpose do you work? <br>  17) Use monitoring sites and servers you work with.  I use zabbix and webopulsar.ru. <br>  18) Backup everything from the computers on which you sit to the servers, the code and databases you work with, the more often the better.  For my computers I use backblaze, for five bucks a month they perfectly backup a couple of terabytes from my desktop, for server scripts for saving to amazon s3, backup ninja, bacula. <br>  19) Move to a sunny country.  I used to think that stories about depression and the absence of the sun are a myth, having lived in Thailand and arriving in Russia, I realized that a sunny day practically charges me and I want to work every day and I don‚Äôt need a stick for that.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151166/">habrahabr.ru/post/151166</a> <br>  20) Self-discipline.  No one will make you work.  I have a simple rule, I always work at least two hours a day.  Not all people can self-discipline, if you can not then freelancing is not for you. <br><br>  21) Get a portfolio.  Sometimes customers ask about your competencies, a beautifully designed portfolio is very useful here.  On the whole, you can be hired just after reviewing your portfolio. <br>  22) Learn English perfectly.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/154333/">habrahabr.ru/post/154333</a> <br>  23) Use clouds (saas, paas, etc).  They really save time and money.  For example, instead of deploying my git, I use github.com for five bucks or I can use bitbucket for free.  I use Amazon cloud and at any time I can deploy a test environment there, get the right amount of ip and more.  Clouds are not beneficial in all situations; remember this too. <br>  24) Learn as much as possible while you are young, over the years the brain becomes numb, the progression is not too fast, but the feeling that you are less aware of the new information is already there. <br>  25) Drink delicious coffee.  Espresso and cappuccino are two of my greatest weaknesses. <br><br>  26) Do not abuse alcohol and drugs, I advise you to get addicted to good red wine. <br>  27) Start a blog, write about work, life, hobbies, hobbies.  Customers love to read our blogs.  My about Thailand <a href="http://pumainthailand.com/">pumainthailand.com</a> <br>  28) Make yourself comfortable workplace with a fast computer.  32 gig of operatives and 4 cores is normal.  A comfortable chair will reduce the amount of pain in your back. <br>  29) Automate everything. <br>  31) Learn to formalize any task and write technical tasks, specs. <br>  32) Test.  The strangest thing in the vast majority of freelancers is not in the habit of testing their work. <br>  33) Log.  Often, to add a log, it is enough to add one line and in difficult times, when everything drops, the logs just save the situation.  The actions of users are often also logged.  But remember that our wheels are not rubber yet. <br><br>  I think it's not a problem to catch up with this list up to 100 points, offer yours. <br>  If you do not understand any point, ask try to figure it out together. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158769/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158769/</a></p>
