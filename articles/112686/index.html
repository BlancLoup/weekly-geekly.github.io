  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Effective team</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Why do teams harness?  Why are some teams full of enthusiasm, trust and passion, while others are pretty and boring?  Unfortunately, there is no recipe for creating a cool team.  It‚Äôs impossible to add 5 grams of trust, set fire to it, add a bit of communication and cook until ready. <br><br>  Do we even need teams? <br><br><h4>  Work alone </h4><br>  Working alone is very cool.  You do not need trust.  Do you trust yourself by default?  If not, then without any doubt you need qualified medical assistance.  Also, you do not need communication skills.  Of course, you can talk to yourself, but if this happens too often, you also need medical attention.  All you need to work effectively is <b>problem solving skills, technical knowledge, and passion</b> .  However, this is not enough for the effective work of the team.

      If you work alone, you make any decisions quickly.  Do not argue with anyone and prove something to someone.  We decided how to do it, and go!  You have a <b>minimal additional workload</b> : there are no meetings, no discussions, no phone calls, no <s>idiotic</s> questions from <s>close</s> colleagues. <br><br>  When working in a team, things are not so rosy, are they?  Suddenly, you have to attend meetings.  You have to participate in various discussions on technical topics (which is nothing yet), as well as other uninteresting and boring topics.  You have to answer questions, at least out of politeness, and often do things with which you completely disagree. <br><br>  So why do people form teams? <a name="habracut"></a>  In fact, everything is simple, the team can solve a problem that is beyond the power of one person.  Alone, you can bring a new theory, but alone it is impossible to implement any serious project.  So the team is an <s>inevitable evil</s> necessity, but it carries with it a certain formalism: <br><ul><li>  Communication is needed to develop a common vision for solving a problem. </li><li>  Coordination of work is needed for the team to work. </li><li>  Team members must understand each other, otherwise disputes will last forever. </li></ul><br>  So, the team helps to solve complex problems, but also carries with it an additional burden. <br><br><h4>  Teamwork </h4><br>  An effective team <b>reduces this additional workload, minimizes it</b> , and allows people to concentrate on important things, namely, problem solving and design.  If you look at the team from this point of view, you can playfully highlight a lot of good, fit practices to increase the team‚Äôs efficiency: <br><ul><li>  Less people.  Small teams have less process load. </li><li>  One language.  Everyone should understand each other as quickly as possible.  This is why offshore teams always have additional problems. </li><li>  Less meetings.  Any meeting that does not solve a specific problem should be canceled.  For example, status report rallies are a completely idiotic practice. </li><li>  Isolation team.  One team - one room.  In one room there should not be 2 teams that do different things. </li><li>  Fast communication channels.  In general, the goal is a minimum of communication.  So if you need to discuss something, the best thing is to do it as quickly as possible, which means personally, and preferably near a large whiteboard. </li></ul><br>  But there is one more thing.  In an attempt to improve the efficiency of a team, it is very easy to reduce its creativity.  It may happen that the team will solve problems quickly, but solutions will not be the best.  Sometimes it is useful to get together and just chat about anything, ranging from the discussion of the film and ending with the theory of super strings.  It is impossible to predict what and when will push us to a cool solution.  Do not drive the team into a rigid framework and communicate only to solve the problem.  You need a little air, a place to chat.  This is often a kitchen.  Therefore, if the company does not have a kitchen or dining room - this is a big minus. <br><br><h4>  The trust </h4><br>  Unable to create a team without trust.  And why, exactly?  Yes, trust simply reduces the need to hold another meeting or discussion.  <b>Trust reduces communication time and allows you to solve problems faster</b> . <br><br>  Imagine a team where people do not particularly trust each other.  You immediately get political games, suspicious questions, streamlined phrases, and ambiguous expressions.  There are hidden conflicts in the team, although on the surface everything is polite and correct. <br><br>  If you look at such a team in action, you will be stunned by stupid decisions and stupid practices.  The goal of any person in such a team is to cover your own <s>ass with your</s> back. <br><br>  A team in which people trust each other, is spared from all this disgrace.  Discussions are hot and to the point.  People may even shout sometimes when discussing a problem, but this doesn‚Äôt really affect anything, because they trust each other.  People easily criticize bad decisions and are not afraid to offer fresh ideas. <br><br>  Trust saves time and allows you to pay attention to real work, not politics. <br><br><h4>  Passion </h4><br>  We all saw people with an extinct look.  We all saw boring half-dead teams, where they work from 9 to 18 and can not wait for the end of the working day.  No one wants to work in such a place.  Surprisingly, many work.  I personally do not understand why people are engaged in such nonsense.  I can not accept the argument at the level of "stability", "salary", "habit."  I can't work in a boring place on boring projects.  It's boring.  It is not interesting.  It's useless.  This depresses and deprives prospects. <br><br>  A passionate team consists of passionate people.  That's all.  They really care about the success of the project.  They are really interested in what they do.  They focus on important things and do everything to achieve a better result.  Passion is a team engine. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  A cool development team consists of several passionate, experienced professionals who trust each other.  They effectively interact with each other to solve problems.  And reach the stars. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112686/</a></p>
