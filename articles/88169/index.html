But at the same time, he was perhaps the most unusual - unlike others, it can be safely considered as a test of the strength of world views.  A simple, at first glance, task at a detailed examination was not so simple.  Nevertheless, many coped with it, and we received neither more nor less - as many as <b>278</b> works! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2d/d08/ca5/a2dd08ca56356c56f9bb6a7d37e96d1c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It was very difficult to choose the most worthy ones, however, the incorruptible jury found the strength to dot the i.  Under the cut - viva to the winners and the distribution of valuable gifts. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you can see, the winners literally step on each other's heels ... but the impartial judges of mathematics said their final word.  So, the fateful points in the results table were distributed as follows:

Honestly, I didn‚Äôt have enough for all the participants, but it was very interesting to watch the ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù.  And, you know, I didn‚Äôt regret it at all - I didn‚Äôt even expect that there would be so much creativity, ideas, and reasoning, and that there would be such a solid approach.  Valuable prizes really deserved. <br><br>  And here, by the way, what the jury said after reviewing the works of the contestants: <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c7/65f/11f/9c765f11feefdc3a2409edc1174800b0.jpg" alt="image">  <b>Dmitry Lukin, Technical Director, Laptop Department, Russian Representative Office, ASUSTeK Computer Inc:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúFirst, a few words about the overall ratings.  They turned out not very high, and all by the fact that no one and no one of the guys surprised me.  Yes, it is very difficult to do this, but I waited for at least a perfect description of the future, but even those two people who received the highest marks did not fully disclose this topic, but it was they who were closest to this, from my point of view.  They made it most beautiful and elegant.  In this task it was clearly visible two directions in which it was necessary to move: the design component and the technical part.  It‚Äôs no secret that the main criterion when choosing a product is design, as we say the product ID, and it was necessary to start moving in this direction (and those two leaders, based on my assessments, coped with this not badly and showed me something interesting and design not disappoint).  And, of course, it was impossible to ‚Äúnot fantasize‚Äù on the subject of the technical component, and some people did it, but in a highly compressed and isolated form, and this, excuse me, did not work, because a good product is a good product, because he must be perfect on all sides. <br><br>  In general, the guys showed good knowledge of current trends and I would even say that at times I was very pleased with their answers and I would even say that I would even be glad to see some of them in our ranks. <br><br>  And I would like to finish with two Chinese sayings.  The first one says ‚ÄúThe person asking the question is a fool for 5 minutes.  A person who does not ask questions is a fool for life! ‚ÄùAnd for this very reason do not be afraid to make mistakes and ask questions - it‚Äôs not for nothing that they say that learning is light, and not learning is darkness.  And the second saying, ‚ÄúA person who does not have his own goal in life, works all his life to realize the goals of others,‚Äù and this is why I want you to always have the right goal in life and not one, and that it always leads you on the right path to your own bigger dream! ‚Äù <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7ef/30a/975/7ef30a9754224be5441debab8f4621a4.jpg" alt="image">  <b>Alexey Rogachkov, Intel Architecture Leading Specialist:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúI would like to express my gratitude to all participants of the competition.  The presented works showed that TrendClub members are not just computer users, but creative people with critical thinking.  In any technically complex product, you can find areas for improvement, but not all of them can see these areas - someone adapts to inconveniences, someone cannot distinguish them, and someone - clearly articulate.  I believe that for companies that produce products for consumers, it is important to contact with an audience that is set up "critically argued."  Looking through the works, I saw people who not only regularly use computers, but also understand what exactly they would like to improve, know how to identify and effectively convey this idea.  The primary criteria for me were: compliance of the work with the task, originality of the idea, practical benefits, possibility of implementation, presentation of the material.  Of course, one cannot deny an element of subjectivity in evaluation.  But the opinions of other colleagues should neutralize this moment, so I am sure that the most worthy option will win. ‚Äù <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a6/83c/e18/1a683ce18b474a205d5a48f8042838d8.jpg" alt="image">  <b>Vladislav Nikonov, Head of Intel Galaxy Test Lab, an online community dedicated to information technology discussions:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúThanks to everyone who took part in our competition!  Special thanks to those who supported the text with beautiful illustrations.  Some of them were even made in professional 3D applications.  You can directly take and send to a factory in China, as a technical task :).  In many papers, I noticed the following trend: People imagine the computer of tomorrow as a compact stylish device designed to solve a wide range of tasks.  So, we, as a company that produces ever more compact and at the same time productive chips, will be able to contribute to the fact that "Your Dream Computer" gets closer to the real embodiment. " <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/00c/971/622/00c97162218141db8bb515de2c77c182.jpg" alt="image">  <b>Alexander Amzin, head of IT editorial office for Lenta.ru:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúThe competition left a mixed impression.  First, a huge number of ‚Äútablet‚Äù computers, although it is not at all obvious that they have a bright future.  Secondly, many participants have become non-scientific fiction.  Thirdly, the majority of ideas, in my opinion, cannot be sold.  Not a single job, I have put dozens - far from ideal to all.  But closest to him came up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãelectronic ink on the cover of the laptop.  Truly bold, original and market.  Thank you, it would be worth holding a contest just for her. ‚Äù <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/999/65d/afa/99965dafa23d8c7d91bab52494b9bb96.jpg" alt="image">  <b>Denis Podolyak, chief editor of Mobile Computers magazine:</b> <br>  ‚ÄúWhen I got acquainted with the works from the‚Äú short list ‚Äù, somewhat unexpectedly for myself, I noticed that some of the ideas of the contestants magically made me not only weigh the pros and cons, but also get involved in creative thoughts on various aspects of the proposed works  And this is good.  When there is something to discuss, something to add and remove, it develops the idea, makes it stronger.  All the proposed ideas are somehow interesting, and in some ways unique.  Nevertheless, I have to note that I have not met any truly original, unexpected works.  However, this can be attributed to one of the requirements of the competition - to be realistic.  And someone managed it more, someone less.  Another observation: many works are a reflection of existing trends.  Friends, be bold, do not rush headlong into unrealistic fiction, but combine in a new way what you have.  And do not try to look for decades ahead, limit yourself to a couple of years.  Good luck! ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  The end </h2><br>  The competition was held under the motto ‚Äú <b>You are dreaming.</b>  <b>ASUS embodies.</b>  <b>Intel inside</b> ‚Äù- as far as I know, this is a free translation from an international competition.  Whatever it was, I hope, ASUS really takes into account at least the work of the finalists - you see, someone's fantasies and sketches will be reflected in real life, and Habr will be updated with new reviews) In general, we congratulate the winners again - I think the new The competition will appear very soon! <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88169/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88169/</a></p>
