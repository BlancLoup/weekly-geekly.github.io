      <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br>  Without fear <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you work?</b> <br>  11‚Äì12 <br><br>  <b>Current mobile device:</b> <br>  iPhone 6 <br><br>  <b>Current computer:</b> <br>  MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Late 2013) <br><br>  <b>Without any applications, programs, utilities you can not live?</b> <br><ul><li>  Diary app Day One, where I write down ideas and dreams </li><li>  Corner - promised himself to fly somewhere at least once a month to clear his mind and be happy </li><li>  Google Drive - here are all the documents </li><li>  Clear - to-doo-app </li><li>  Feedly - the source of all information, structured by me under me, and not like in the Facebook feed by a silly robot under my avatar </li><li>  Instagram - a social network in which they do not swear </li><li>  Yandex Transport - it is more pleasant to travel by trolleybus to work than by subway, and cheaper than by taxi </li><li>  Sunrise - mobile calendar </li><li>  Rambler Cashier - so buy movie tickets </li><li>  Dropbox - all photos and files in this cloud </li><li>  Hazel is a utility that automatically sorts all the files on the hard disk into the necessary folders (it is incredibly frustrating when it starts to fail) </li><li>  Facebook Eradicator - Removes Facebook feed from browser </li></ul><br>  <b>Which life hack helps you save time?</b> <br>  There is one that, with proper training, saves a lot of time and effort - ‚Äúdelegate‚Äù.  Do not take too much on yourself, do not give too many tasks to one person in the team.  While not always obtained. <br><br>  <b>What kind of to-do manager do you use?</b> <br>  Clear <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br>  A. When not tired: listen to lectures, new music, podcasts. <br>  B. When I am tired: I listen to mantras, classical music and various noises. <br><br>  <b>What are you reading now?</b> <br>  I read three books at once, then I‚Äôll have to reread it, but there‚Äôs no other way.  Incredibly curious and controversial study of Louis-Georges Tin "The Invention of Heterosexual Culture" that heterosexuality as a norm did not exist in the Middle Ages.  "Algorithm of the invention" of Heinrich Altshuller - about how to invent.  I advise everyone to study the Altshuller figure, to put a photo next to Steve Jobs in a frame on the shelf at home.  It is possible and instead.  "Debt.  The first 5,000 years of history ‚Äùby David Greber - that the economists invented the entire economic system and its historical rationale, do not believe it. <br><br>  <b>Which book from the last read was remembered the most?</b> <br>  Maria Vasilchikova ‚ÄúThe Berlin Diary‚Äù.  This diary of the Russian emigrant, who found Berlin on the eve of World War II, and during the time too.  The most terrible thing is to read the frivolous ‚Äúnothing, it will pass,‚Äù when by all indications it is about to begin, and you, the reader from 2015, know what this will lead to.  The second book, which I cannot fail to mention, is not at all about the past, rhyming with the present, but about the present, flowing into the future.  This is the "Age of Earthquakes: A Guide to the Extreme Present" by Douglas Coupland, Hans Ulrich Obrist, and Shumon Bazar.  The book should be on the table for any person who is trying to understand what is happening. <br><br>  <b>Do you use e-readers or prefer paper books?</b> <br>  Both.  I love books with good paper, a cover, footnotes.  Readers do not disdain. <br><br>  <b>How long do you sleep?</b> <br>  I go to bed at 2, wake up at 8: 30‚Äì9: 00 <br><br>  <b>Are you an owl or a lark?</b> <br>  Circumstances compel to be an owl, but in the morning it is better to work and think. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br>  Often I do not eat breakfast, but I am going to change my bad habit.  I come to work and drink a glass of water, I remember about eating an hour in two days. <br><br>  <b>How do you spend your time on the way to work / from work?</b> <br>  For long articles or games, preferably also long ones.  For example, I recently took on the once abandoned Ghost Trick, the iOS port of the Nintendo completely crazy poltergeist game in the lead role.  I try at this time not to respond to letters or instant messengers. <br><br>  <b>What advice you have ever been given can you convey to others?</b> <br>  To think about others always: in business negotiations (and how it benefits the other side), in disputes (and why it seems to him / her differently), and most importantly, in work (why is it important for the reader, what interests him or not? it's his time).  It turns out, as usual, not always, but when it comes out, the world gets a little better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292116/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292116/</a></p>
