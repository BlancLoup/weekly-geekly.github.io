      Music in the movie plays the most important role.  It creates an emotional-semantic space, involving us in the process of watching films.  Music leaves a giant trail of emotional perception when we end up watching a movie.  With the help of the right music, song and artist you can make the viewer headlong immersed in what is happening on the screen. <br><br>  Of course, as many people in the world, so many opinions, but with some of them can not disagree.  The music of some films penetrates the very heart and leaves only the most pleasant impressions.  Lorenzo Peroni (Lorenzo Peroni) <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-films-do-you-remember-for-their-music-sound">made</a> his own list, in the first place which put Sergio Leone's film " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-7syYdo2SEQ">Once Upon a Time in the Wild West</a> " with the stunning music of Ennio Morricone, where the picture on the screen is surprisingly accurately compared with musical motifs. <br><br>  “During the three-hour western, we begin to notice that each character has its own musical theme, and this only stirs up the interest,” says Lorenzo. <br><br>  Martin Fox (Martin Fox) adds that the film “ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DXjehlT1VjiU">Good, bad, evil</a> ” is also worth mentioning among westerns with Ennio Morricone’s compositions. <br><br>  Another worth noting picture " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DY4cLmXml8O0">Pulp Fiction</a> " by Quentin Tarantino, which has become so popular thanks in large part to the soundtrack.  Tarantino chose rare styles of the 60s and 70s - rock and roll, surf, soul and funk - and brought music to the forefront, giving her time to express themselves and influence the viewer. <br><br>  In general, many Tarantina films are distinguished by their musical accompaniment.  Aaron Johnson (Aaron Johnson) decided to <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-films-do-you-remember-for-their-music-sound">highlight</a> his crime drama "Jackie Brown", in which "wisely used old school R'n'B-music." <br><br>  Lorenzo, in turn, marks the film “The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DeGa6SbK1HcY">Blue Deep</a> ” by Luc Besson.  For the European version of the film, the composer was Eric Serra, who often worked with Besson.  “I didn’t like the ending and soundtrack of the American version,” Peroni shares her thoughts.  “However, if you look at her first, you will probably be treated differently.” <br><br>  As for Martin Fox, he put in the first place the Stanley Kubrick film “A Space Odyssey of 2001”.  He says that Odyssey has the most striking soundtrack he has ever heard.  “The music is chosen in such a way that it sounds both familiar and unusual,” exclaims Martin.  “I cannot imagine this film without the music of Strauss, Khachaturian and Ligeti.” <br><br>  Aaron Johnson also touched on the space theme and singled out the movie “Star Wars.  Episode I: The Hidden Threat. ”  This is the film that made him love classical music: “Maybe it will come as a surprise, but the first episode is my favorite movie.  I am not at all ashamed of it! <br><br>  There is little John Williams music there, but I feel goose bumps every time I hear “ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DqzVBqBosf5w">Duel of the Fates</a> ” during the battle of Darth Maul with the Jedi.  The same thing happens during Anakin’s battle with Obi-Wan. ” <br><br>  In fact, in films about space, there is always amazing music that lets you feel the depth and vastness of infinite space.  It should be noted stunning Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer and his work from the film " <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DUDVtMYqUAyw">Interstellar</a> ".  Exciting stuff! <br><br>  By the way, this track <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-hans-zimmer-wrote-the-interstellar-theme-2014-11">was born in a</a> very interesting way.  Christopher, the director of the film, approached Hans and asked: "Hans, if I write you a couple of sentences on a piece of paper and say nothing more, will you agree to work for me one day?" <br><br>  Zimmer gave an affirmative answer.  On that little piece of paper, there was a little story about a father leaving his child to perform an important task.  There was a dialogue consisting of only two remarks: “I will come back.  “When?” <br><br>  Even Nolan quoted a quote that Zimmer once said during dinner with him and his wife in a London restaurant.  “Then we talked about children,” recalls Hans.  “I said that when you have children, you can no longer look at yourself with your own eyes, you always look at yourself with the eyes of your child.” <br><br>  The composer, as promised, wrote a musical theme, which was demonstrated to Christopher.  He was delighted.  Only after this, the director decided to reveal the plot of the film, describing the colossal epic story about the cosmos, science and the fate of all mankind.  “I told him:“ Chris, wait a second, I wrote a very personal melody, ”to which he replied:“ Everything connected with this film is very personal, ”says Zimmer. <br><br>  In general, Hans Zimmer is an outstanding person and has already worked with Christopher Nolan more than once: what is the composition of “ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRxabLA7UQ9k">Time</a> ” for the film “Beginning” and “ <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D94TAFSMdkvk">The Dark Knight</a> ” for “The Dark Knight”.  He also wrote the music for the films "Pirates of the Caribbean" and the cartoon "The Lion King". <br><br>  Speaking of fantasy worlds.  Everyone seems to know John H. Williams' <a href="https://prezi.com/k1_kak32xkcz/harry-potter-hedwigs-theme-composed-by-jason-williams/">Hedwig's Theme</a> from the Harry Potter films.  This melody is an integral part of the film epic and a kind of calling card of the series. <br><br>  The theme of music reveals the idea of ​​magic and opens the world of wizards to the audience.  It is an important part of the success of the story, because it has undergone some changes, for example, Patrick Doyle, who wrote the music for the Fire Cup, made this melody darker and darker, trying to eliminate “childishness” from it. <br><br>  Another popular fantasy world is the Lord of the Rings universe.  Music for all these films was written by Howard Shore.  He received an Oscar for his work on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DshdiTRxTJb4">soundtrack of</a> the movie "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King." <br><br>  The most popular musical themes of the trilogy were " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DgKGREf7wDdc">Shire</a> ", " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DlknScn88HSs">The Fellowship</a> " and " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DE5_xb522jEo">Rohan</a> ".  Each of them is repeated in films a huge number of times in different orchestrations, conveying a different mood. <br><br>  “The scope of the story is amazing, and therefore the music is quite complex,” <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Music/01/15/mroom.shore/index.html">says</a> Shore.  “Music is part of the story — it shows the relationship between heroes and cultures.”  Typically, a composer needs <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/Music/01/15/mroom.shore/index.html">to write</a> 50–60 minutes of music for a movie — for the third part of the trilogy, Howard wrote a 3.5 hour long soundtrack (the total length of all the melodies of the trilogy is about 11–12 hours). <br><br>  Ajim Bagwan also decided to <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-films-do-you-remember-for-their-music-sound">join</a> the discussion of this issue and made his list of films with excellent music and original compositions.  Woody Allen's movie <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DIF3_2P7F46c">Midnight in Paris</a> got there.  Woody is known for making great films with a soundtrack that suits them perfectly.  The director has a certain weakness for jazz, so French jazz was added to the motion picture. <br><br>  Even in his list hit the movie " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DjKcsVo3Ndrg">Oldboy</a> ".  This is a unique film with an original soundtrack that feeds the atmosphere of anxiety and worry and adds depth to the main scenes. <br><br>  In the playlist of Ajima, the soundtracks for the films “Easy Rider”, “The Godfather”, “At the Needle”, “Into the Wild”, “Pulp Fiction”, “Good Morning, Vietnam” and “Friday” also appeared.  An even greater number of them can be found in the <a href="https://sunglassesandcinema.quora.com/">blog of</a> Aaron Ellis (Aaron Ellis). <br><br>  The tradition to use music in films appeared from the time of silent films, when the broadcast was accompanied by a pianist playing in the hall.  Then there were films with sound, and music became commonplace. <br><br>  Today, the melody behind the scenes is woven into our experiences, feeds our emotions, so the composers give their best 100% so that we, the audience, have goosebumps or tears running down our cheeks. <br><br>  <i>PS More materials on the topic of music and audio - in our " <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/mirhifi/">World Hi-Fi</a> ".</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390745/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390745/</a></p>
