This question is asked by many, because our elderly relatives and grandparents do not recognize newfangled gadgets.  ‚ÄúWhy do I need this thing?  I do not understand anything in it ... ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f25/1fe/95c/f251fe95cf1044a3bac581992af65bc4.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  That's right, the most popular thing on the Internet is that we are advised to buy a tablet or laptop, install Skype there, and supposedly let the old people rejoice and call you and see your faces and smiles ... All of course is cool, but most simply refuse to use, inventing a pretext that they are afraid to break everything.  Here the main thing is simplicity. <br><br>  I thought: what do the old people really do?  What would be useful for them?  And the thoughts came together for cleaning and cleanliness.  Then I decided to find, and what of the gadgets can correspond to this topic.  The first thing I found was a <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/3l">mop robot ($ 29.67) *</a> .

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0a7/4a0/0cc/0a74a00cc89f4cc3a997023f000babdd.jpg"><br><br>  This is a very simple thing, you just take it, press a button, and the robo-mop starts driving around the room and washing the floor.  Thanks to the touch sensors, it does not abut against an obstacle when colliding, but turns and follows further in the free direction, thereby clearing the rest of the territory. <br><br>  The only thing to do is to change the rag after each bath.  They are in principle easy to find, since in Russia this kind of gadgets are no longer new.  And ordering, for example, from China at a lower price of 30 bucks, without a huge cheat local shops, you can simply buy these rags. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkc6SK4L2n8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhje6awnzmluCGttwyBndc3nhKvJqA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The next thought was that old people love to walk.  But they often complain about their eyesight and the fact that it is dark ... The cane will be able to simplify their life, since they are no longer young, and their legs get tired.  Convenient lantern in the handle of the cane, highlighting the path of walking directions, if it is already dark outside.  And even this is already sold to our Chinese friends, and at a reasonable price.  Most of the options on the market are foldable, so you can easily put it in your bag.  And some models have FM radio to enjoy music while walking through the park. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28a/d5b/226/28ad5b226b1344a6a4e3f03958a5e7d5.jpg"><br><br>  In principle, nothing complicated, durable cane with a lantern built into the handle.  All ingenious is simple. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Below I gave a few options most liked me.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/3m">Folding Walking Sticks Walking Cane ($ 22.26) *:</a> </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/094/1c4/534/0941c453494a4ac190de0e8ef70da68a.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/3n">LED lighting Automatic tuned FM radio ($ 40) *:</a> </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/743/9a4/1d9/7439a41d94794ecb917c90c610df9fb2.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  Another interesting option would be a gift in the form of a smart bracelet, for example, <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/3s">Xiaomi Miband Bluetooth 4.0 ($ 14.49) *</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b85/939/d4e/b85939d4eb1c47b495e725b5d0ad5a6e.jpg"><br>  A grandfather or grandmother could have a hobby to see how many steps they have walked today.  You can brag to your friends or friends about the perfect way today and show evidence!  :) I think it could to some extent encourage them to move more, and sensitively made life more interesting. <br><br>  Another function of the bracelet is to be an alarm clock, which will remind you with a vibration of the appointed time (for example, medication), or just wake you up.  Not to mention the fact that due to poor hearing, they can often not hear your phone.  And if you synchronized the bracelet with your smartphone, when you call or receive an SMS, it would vibrate on your hand.  It would save you from unnecessary anxiety, and the old people did not get upset that they missed a call from their relatives. <br><br>  The only disadvantage of such a bracelet is that the application for it is still on the smartphone and in English, but this can be solved simply by showing "what to press" and "where to look." <br><br>  Some bracelets also have a pulse measurement for everything, for example, <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/3r">Original Xiaomi Mi Band 1S ($ 28.99) *</a> .  I think this feature would also be useful for an elderly person, but it will go on sale only from December 8th. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/603/73b/1c2/60373b1c20bd4e4e9bbfb9a6e3363c6f.jpg"><br><br>  Well, the final version of the gift becomes very useful, and not only for old people, but also for many young people <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/3q">WSKEN 1M Metal ($ 9.90) *</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f3/360/f9e/7f3360f9ea364f088813b82f07c7a075.jpg"><br><br>  This is a very interesting development of a magnetic USB cable.  Thanks to her, an elderly person does not need to aim every time to get into the socket to charge the phone.  It is enough to insert the module with the USB connector into the phone once, and in the future just connect the magnetic end of the wire in one motion (the magnet will fix the wire itself). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/620/b79/933/620b79933e7d453e8ab2e8d0c0ec05f5.jpg"><br><br>  This would save the time and effort of an older person.  After all, now it is not necessary to wear glasses, focus and try to carefully get into the right connector. <br><br>  Remember that close to friends, important attention.  But with the right gifts, they will remember you with a smile and feel your care. <br><br>  That's all, with you there was a simple service for selecting complex technology <a href="https://dronk.ru/">Dronk.Ru</a> <br>  Do not forget to subscribe to our <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/">blog</a> , there will be many more interesting things. <br><br>  ps * - links marked with an asterisk referral, so you can save money by returning cashback up to 4%.
