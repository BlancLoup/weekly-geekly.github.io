    <a name="habracut"></a>  We have already talked about the fact that children are definitely involved in testing our applications.  In addition, the design and the idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"Pirates of the Milk Sea" blog readers were told in a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/littlebeetle/blog/171533/">separate article</a> .  We still want to say a lot about ‚ÄúPirates of the Milky Sea‚Äù, but it‚Äôs very difficult to convey with words the special atmosphere of the application that the whole Little Beetle team worked on.  To decide whether our application succeeded or failed, we provided the children. <br><br>  Boring and dull testing is not for us.  To create a real pirate party, this time we even stocked up props - hats that any pirate captain would envy.  The children appreciated our idea and gladly passed the test without taking off their hats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e6d/fd7/f14/e6dfd7f146d38c1a59adecf04134ab04.jpg"><br><br>  Developers have concentrated with the utmost attention, watching the actions of children.  The photographer and cameraman were at the ready.  And so, the journey began! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e60/edf/476/e60edf476f27786c7947cec9871b8f27.jpg"><br><br>  To prevent children from having difficulties with the concept of the essence of the tasks, we introduced <b>clues</b> that appear every time a child reaches an unfamiliar task.  We made sure that all the clues are quite effective, and children do not need additional explanations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/46e/508/486/46e5084861abe0b84b9b886140bbb3e8.jpg"><br><br>  In total, there are <b>13 unique mini-games</b> in the application, which are aimed at developing and training logic, attention, memory, reaction speed, fine motor skills of hands and other important qualities that a brave pirate cannot do without.  Mazes, puzzles, puzzles, tasks for finding treasures await the conquerors of the seas ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/433/354/66b/43335466b60bcca962b907ece4baa383.jpg"><br><br>  ... repelling the attacks of enemy ships and sea monsters, adventures in the cemetery and in the woods inhabited by giant mosquitoes.  And this is not all the tasks that await curious travelers.  Read more about mini-games <a href="http://littlebeetle.net/ru/blog/start-the-unforgettable-adventure-with-the-tales-of-pirates.htm">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/65b/2d1/425/65b2d1425f2e5433dae8b01c47e4977e.jpg"><br><br>  This time, children of primary school age arrived to us, and they were of great benefit, because during the testing process we found out that some tasks are too difficult for the age of 6-7 years.  Fortunately, we have foreseen a change in the levels of difficulty that will open when the child passes the entire game.  Some tasks were decided to be simplified. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/47e/252/b83/47e252b83af3220ad6d8856b877ac270.jpg"><br><br>  The children told us in detail which tasks they liked ( <i>‚ÄúOctopus‚Äù, ‚ÄúChest‚Äù, ‚ÄúBeach‚Äù</i> ) and which caused difficulties ( <i>‚ÄúAnchor‚Äù, ‚ÄúDirigible‚Äù</i> ).  The task in which you want to count bananas, testers approved unanimously. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b0/2c9/70f/2b02c970f8e35d41a704ac93a974a266.jpg"><br><br>  It should be said that the application turned out "juicy" and rich, ranging from detailed maps, where you can see a lot of funny details, and ending with thematic music (never tire of repeating that we pay great attention to high-quality sounds and pleasant music).  The first-graders came prepared - they learned and told us poems on the pirate theme, which really touched and annulled even the most sullen programmers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8ab/79e/bbf/8ab79ebbfec6c14a8749e91a998f8a49.jpg"><br><br>  Testing participants made an invaluable contribution to the creation of the ‚ÄúPirates of the Milk Sea‚Äù.  Of course, they were not left without gifts and diplomas, confirming them in the honorary title of "Young Tester".
