  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do we get free software without using torrent trackers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When writing any service, you always first of all come across the question of choosing the infrastructure - in which language to write, which frameworks to use, which one to choose hosting and so on.  The selection criteria include the assessment of the necessary requirements for the technologies and products under consideration for the future service, their knowledge, as well as cost.  The total cost of the technologies involved in the <a href="http://edusty.ru/">Edusty</a> service was <b>more than 120,000 rubles</b> .  I will tell you more about what technologies and how we got them <b>absolutely free</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/415/e22/b11/415e22b1170240229bc92b8b7d34f644.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the fall of 2012, when Edusty existed only as an idea in my head, we had not thought yet what technologies we would use for the service.  There was only the understanding that there should be clients for smartphones.  On October 23, 2012, Microsoft held Windows 8 Summit in Moscow - a free conference dedicated to the release of Windows 8, after visiting which I, like all other participants, was invited to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/microsoft/wowzapp/">WOWZAPP</a> hackathon.  On this hackathon everyone could write an application for the Windows Store for 3 days and 2 nights and get prizes.  My idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application, which could be implemented in 3 days, did not occur to me at all.  I just talked with people, looked at interesting projects and eventually decided to join one developer.  His idea did not reach the final, but for the landmark performance we were given encouraging prizes - a thematic group and a Microsoft BizSpark Startup card.  He took his mug. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/428/9be/a7b/4289bea7ba45452085a6d16e39ec15db.png">

      Microsoft BizSpark Startup involves creating a startup page on the corresponding portal, as well as connecting to it up to 7 employees, each of whom is given an MSDN Ultimate subscription for a period of 3 years.  This fact was decisive in the choice of technologies for the future service, because it solved the problem of hosting (Windows Azure), a test server (Windows Server 2012), a database server (MS SQL Server), Windows for work PCs, version control systems, task accounting and bugs (tfs) and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf6/d4d/1dd/bf6d4d1dd16a42b9b6d031be5d4b77b1.jpg"><br><br>  The Windows Azure platform is not necessarily ASP .NET for web applications (you can use any technologies and operating systems on it), but we decided to write the server part in ASP .NET MVC Web API, because, for example, nobody knew PHP from us and I already knew C # and the Web API template made it quick and easy to start writing a RESTful service.  We have deployed a database server for storing service data and a BLOB container for storing avatars and attachments in Windows Azure.  Windows Azure allows you to conveniently create and configure services with which you can perform periodic actions.  For example, we created a service for deleting files from a BLOB container that are not tied to any entry in the service. <br><br>  After launching the service, we needed to make a small advertising site that we would link to (including at the beginning of this article).  Of course, the first thought was to place it in Windows Azure, in the same place as the service.  However, if the domain <i>azurewebsites.net</i> service is normal, then for the site I wanted a more beautiful one.  After registering the domain <i>edusty.ru,</i> we tried to bind it to Windows Azure, but even following all the instructions and tips, we could not do it.  Making these or other changes and waiting for the DNS update was spent more than a week, and the site was already needed in working condition, so I had to place it on a third-party hosting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce0/add/a78/ce0adda78cc840f59143964793512c16.jpg"><br><br>  The Microsoft BizSpark Startup program, in addition to the MSDN subscription, involves promoting a startup and searching for investors.  To do this, you need to fill in the startup profile on the appropriate portal and describe ways to monetize.  When our participation in this program had just begun, we only began to work out the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe service itself, which was supposed to be the sum of our master's work at the university and therefore we were not bothered with the issue of monetization.  After almost 2 years we launched the service and only now we are working on possible ways of monetization, and therefore we have not yet taken advantage of the opportunity to move to BizSpark Startup. <br><br>  In less than a year, we‚Äôve been completing the Microsoft BizSpark Startup program and, in order to continue using the software that we received from the subscription, you have to go through Graduation and pay $ 100 (you still have to pay).  You also have to start paying for Windows Azure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245699/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245699/</a></p>
