  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Against stress and insomnia: music will help</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Weightless was <a href="http://www.openculture.com/2016/11/hear-weightless-the-most-relaxing-song-ever-made.html">named</a> by scientists as the most relaxing composition capable of reducing stress levels, and effective against insomnia.  The track was created in collaboration with scientists from the <a href="http://www.britishacademyofsoundtherapy.com/">British Academy of Sound Therapy</a> . <br><br>  In 2014, a tune appeared in the video, which for all this time has collected more than 21 million views on Youtube.  Today we will understand what is so special about this melody, what is the reason for the effect attributed to it and how music in general affects the human body. <br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/288824/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d30/53c/0cd/d3053c0cd70146b7af3952396492e893.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a>  <i><font color="#A9A9A9">Photos of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/alexnormand/">Alexandre Normand</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC-BY</a></font></i> <br><br>  Members of the Marconi Union group in an <a href="https://mai.art/content/weightless-endless">interview</a> told about the process of creating a composition.  They used the opportunity to work with scientists, but they themselves did not make any statements regarding the properties of this track.  And they had nothing to do with research.  Soon after the release of the composition, they decided to modify the original melody to a full-fledged album, which was called Weightless (Ambient Transmissions Vol. 2) and which eventually included 6 songs.

    <h2>  <b>Believe it or not</b> </h2><br>  Neurologists from Mindlab International conducted a <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2773624/Is-relaxing-song-EVER-Listen-music-scientifically-proven-send-sleep.html">study</a> in which 40 women participated.  The results of this experiment, many are <a href="http://www.chartattack.com/news/2016/11/16/this-is-the-most-relaxing-song-in-the-world-according-to-very-flimsy-science/">skeptical</a> , given the small number of subjects, the attitude to the discoveries of British scientists and in general to sound therapy.  Nevertheless, the news spread through many publications, and Time magazine <a href="http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2099708,00.html">included the</a> composition in the 50 best inventions of the year. <br><br>  Participants in the experiment were placed in a stressful situation: they had to solve complex puzzles for a while, while listening to various melodies.  Special sensors recorded heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and brain activity.  The study's lead, neuropsychologist David Lewis-Hodgson (David Lewis-Hodgson) <a href="http://www.wakingtimes.com/2016/12/30/science-discovers-this-one-song-reduces-anxiety-by-65-percent-listen/">said</a> that the music had an impact not only on the areas of the brain responsible for processing the sound, but also on the area of ‚Äã‚Äãemotional perception. <br><br>  Based on the measurement results, the scientists concluded that the Weightless composition reduces anxiety in a stressful situation by 65%, and at rest by 35%.  To achieve this <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8830066/Band-creates-the-most-relaxing-tune-ever.html">effect, the</a> track rhythm gradually slows down from 60 beats [metronome] per minute to 50. While listening, the heart rate adjusts to the rhythm of the melody, which requires at least five minutes.  This phenomenon is called "entrainment."  Including thanks to this track relaxes more effectively than a walk, massage or a cup of tea. <br><br>  The founder of the British Academy of Sound Therapy, Liz Cooper (Lyz Cooper), who participated in the creation of the track, explained that a decrease in heart rate also leads to a decrease in blood pressure.  Pauses are aimed at creating a feeling of comfort.  And the lack of repetitive moments helps the brain to shut down, as it stops trying to predict what will happen next. <br><br>  The composition ends with low whistling sounds reminiscent of Buddhist singing, which also contributes to relaxation.  All this together also leads to a decrease in the level of the stress hormone cortisol.  In addition, it was found that Weightless was 11% more effective than other tunes in reducing anxiety in a stressful situation.  Other tunes included songs by Mozart, Enya and Coldplay.  (The full list can be found <a href="https://www.inc.com/melanie-curtin/neuroscience-says-listening-to-this-one-song-reduces-anxiety-by-up-to-65-percent.html">here</a> ). <br><br>  We invite you to listen to the Weightless composition and evaluate its effectiveness yourself: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UfcAVejslrU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The influence of music on the nervous system is proved by other, more serious studies.  A group of scientists from the University of Wisconsin-Madison <a href="http://jass.neuro.wisc.edu/2013/01/Lab%2520Report%2520602_5%2520final%2520submission.pdf">analyzed</a> methods for measuring the influence of music on a person.  For example, the electrical activity of the skin is an indicator of the activity of the autonomic nervous system.  With unexpected changes in music, this figure reaches its peak.  The next reliable indicator is the heart rate, since they are directly affected by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system. <br><br>  A study in the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford showed that only the pace of music affects changes in cardiovascular and respiratory parameters: fast music of various genres caused an increase in blood pressure, heart rate and respiratory rate, as well as a decrease in the sensitivity of the baroreflex.  But slow music caused a significant decrease in heart rate and slower breathing compared with the baseline. <br><br><h2>  <b>Sleep my joy sleep</b> </h2><br>  In addition to reducing stress, Weightless helps you fall asleep.  In the same <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/8830066/Band-creates-the-most-relaxing-tune-ever.html">study</a> , conducted by Mindlab International, some of the participants in the experiment, while listening to the composition in a quiet state, fell asleep.  Therefore, the experiment conducted the scientists do not recommend listening to this track at the wheel.  In many ways, this action is due to the <a href="http://www.self.com/story/this-song-is-practically-guaranteed-to-help-you-sleep">relaxing</a> effect.  For insomnia, the composition of the Marconi Union group is unlikely to suit everyone, but there are alternative options.  About some we have already written <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/286352/">here</a> . <br><br>  But you can search for a ‚Äúsleepy‚Äù track to your taste on streaming services, for example, on Google Play Music, where there are about 50 playlists to sleep on.  Service curator Brady Hayward (Brady Hayward) <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/sonimacom/the-10-best-songs-to-help-you-fall-asleep-faster_b_9264298.html">notes</a> that most tracks do not contain words.  You can search for the following playlists: Sleepytime Indie, Fall Asleep, Classical for Sleeping, Ladies Serenading You to Sleep and Acoustic Bedtime.  The article also provides a list of the most popular tracks for falling asleep according to Spotify. <br><br>  Interestingly, according to a study <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18426457">published</a> in the Journal of Advanced Nursing, classical music can have a relaxing effect, but in the fight against insomnia, it is not the best assistant.  This is due to a very wide dynamic range.  Therefore, even a small passage with a louder sound inside a classical composition can spoil the whole effect. <br><br>  But besides insomnia, many people have problems waking up.  Music can help here too.  If you go from the opposite, namely from the properties of music for sleep, then we can assume that in the morning will help fast and loud songs.  But not everything is so simple.  To address this issue, Spotify even <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/20-best-wake-up-alarm-songs-on-spotify-2015-11">attracted a</a> Ph.D., a music psychologist from the University of Cambridge, who, together with specialists in data analysis and processing from Spotify, looked for the most effective tracks for the morning time. <br><br>  As a result, 20 tracks were selected (Coldplay with the composition Viva la Vida were in the first place in the ranking), which combined some common properties.  According to the team led by the scientist, a sharp and loud start is not the best option.  Music should gradually gain momentum.  In addition, in the morning music, words are not only permissible, but also welcomed, as they can set the correct positive attitude.  Sound elements of music also play an important role: the tempo should be quite high, 100-130 beats per minute, and the beat should emphasize the second and fourth beat of each measure. <br><br>  PS <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/288822/">Digest "World Hi-Fi": TV, exhibitions, "past and future" audio technologies</a> . <br><br>  PPS Some more materials on the topic from ‚ÄúHi-Fi World‚Äù: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4977.html">"Too Work": The Art of Listening to Music</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4963.html">How sounds affect our sleep and productivity</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4961.html">What is useful (and dangerous) around us "noise"</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4844.html">‚ÄúAmazing Sound‚Äù: How what we hear can change our perception</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403689/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403689/</a></p>
