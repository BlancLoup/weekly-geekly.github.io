  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Valve urged fans not to boycott Left 4 Dead 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/563/79e/888/56379e8882f386af75aeb93db0d67b66.jpg" align="left">  With the amount of news, scandals and rumors, this game can quite compete with the acclaimed GTA IV.  The latter, I remind you, they had a huge amount.  Left 4 Dead, a popular zombie shooter, we‚Äôll talk about it today, never get off the front pages of top gaming titles.  This is due to the sequel, announced at the last E3. <br><br>  Passion for him does not stop.  There are many reasons for that, to take at least a couple of them.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/66112/">The accusation of racism, the signed contract with the mega-popular musical group</a> , as well as the most important thing that made Valve literally embark on the warpath with its own fans - an organized boycott of the sequel by the fans. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After the announcement of the sequel to the outrage of the players there was no limit.  A <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/groups/L4D2boycott">special group</a> was even created on Steam ªe, the game's client program.  When the day before yesterday the number of the group exceeded 40 thousand, the Balsa surrendered. <br><br>  They called not to boycott Left 4 Dead 2, promising to synchronize with the release of updates for the latter and periodically release various add-ons for the original, also stating that the cards from Left 4 Dead can be safely used in the sequel.  Something like one-way compatibility.

      Also, ‚Äúwaffles‚Äù are seriously thinking about the so-called mixed gaming - playing on one server of both the original owners and the owners of the second part of the game.  There should be no problems with this, given the fact that Valve has one engine for all the games of the last decade - Source, so cross-gaming will most likely be implemented and there will be at least problems with it. <br><br>  And yesterday Valv ªovtsy announced a new company for the original, her name is "The Crash Course".  It is intended to be a connecting link between the companies "No Mercy" and "Death Toll".  When these additional cards come out is unknown, but knowing how long Valve can sit on one company, but still release a patch under 200 megabytes after a week fixing all the bugs and exploits, it is reasonable to assume that the release date is modified somewhere for the release of the sequel . <br><br>  The last, I recall, will be released on November 17 of this year.  So, we‚Äôll get the two-hundred-patch patch on the 24th.  Then the company will be quite replayable. <br><br>  Oh yeah, I almost forgot - like all Valve add-ons like this, the company will be released on PC and Xbox 360. Computer scientists cheer because they will get it for free and will be the next update automatically downloaded to Steam.  But the Xboxers will have to pay 7 bucks for the company, which is equal to 600 Microsoft Points in their language.  By the way, the soniboi - the owners of the PlayStation 3 - remain again unsuccessful. <br><br>  Duck Lombardi, a marketer at Valve, is on the lurch and swearing that the reason for the duty of console players to give out 10 bucks for 4 cards lies in an agreement with Microsoft.  They say the latter still forced to take the creators of the players for any more or less weighty addition of at least $ 5.  Something from the category "I am not guilty, he came to me," agree? <br><br>  That's all I wanted to say.  Play only good games. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66284/</a></p>
