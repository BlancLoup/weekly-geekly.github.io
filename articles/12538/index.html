  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Minority Report</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The fact is that democracy has successfully remained in the past century.  No seriously.  A year ago, in the 1900m, there was a minority in most of the world‚Äôs territory, which had, let's say, ‚Äúwealth‚Äù.  And there was an overwhelming majority who were committed to ensuring the well-being of this minority itself.  And for the twentieth century, having passed through a series of imbalances in the form of dictatorships, mankind has reached the point that the majority now, although it still does not solve anything, already live, if not adequately, then at least bearable. <br><br>  The twenty-first century has changed a lot.  Now the main world evil is just the majority.  It is they who vote for Bush, Putin and Lukashenko.  It is they who make decisions that no thinking person can be satisfied with.  They believe any propaganda.  They laugh at jokes of television comedians and listen to terry pop music. <br><br>  By the way, yes.  It was mass culture that was the first and obvious to many beacon of the future.  And for many, and the present.  Already only the most dense inhabitants of the suburbs are ready, with genuine joy, to tap and clap under Britney Spears or, say, under Philip Kirkorov.  The rest have long understood that the "mass culture" has no relation to the "mass character" for a long time.  Rather, because of its stereotyped and imperceptible nature, it still does not irritate the very majority that it agrees to tolerate.  Any truly noteworthy manifestation of culture is now designed to be perceived by a fairly small party and cannot possibly please everyone.  The time of big stars and universal values ‚Äã‚Äãhas passed.  The time has come for minorities and niches.  You are a living man of flesh and blood - it means that you are different from your neighbor.  You are different though from someone - it means that you are in the minority.  You're in the minority - it means your needs are not like everyone else.  But in fact, no "all" has long been left.  Small groups of people remained, and each of these groups needs its own rules, privileges and laws, according to which they will exist and coexist with the rest. </div>
