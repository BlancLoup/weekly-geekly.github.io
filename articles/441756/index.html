The release of ready-made versions of Linux-based operating systems, both server and client, is scheduled before the end of this year. <br><br>  At the moment, the first stage has been completed: an assembly and repository system has been developed for the Baikal-M processor based on the ARM v8 architecture.  The repository is compiled on the basis of approximately 10 thousand packages of the Sisyphus project, one of the world's largest banks of free software packages created by Russian software developers.  The repository <a href="https://www.altlinux.org/Ports/aarch64">is available for testing</a> . <br><br>  At the second stage, it is supposed to test on various AArch64 systems, at the third - build distributions for various purposes and test on prototypes of the ‚ÄúBaikal-M‚Äù processor. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe development of domestic universal hardware and software solutions is our long-standing desire, which is now finally being implemented,‚Äù said Alexey Novodvorsky, General Director of Basalt SPO, ‚ÄúOur collaboration with developers of domestic hardware systems and software application solutions will significantly increase the technological independence of domestic making.  We have extensive experience developing systems for 32-bit ARMv7 processors and working on 64-bit processors is a natural development of our competencies. ‚Äù <br><br>  In turn, the general director of Baikal Electronics, Svetlana Legostaeva, expressed the hope that ‚Äúthe readiness of the software ecosystem by the time the developed‚Äú Baikal-M ‚Äùprocessor is released will make it possible to quickly create end devices in demand on the market‚Äù <br><br>  At the moment, ‚ÄúBaikal Electronics‚Äù and ‚ÄúBasalt SPO‚Äù are considering promising cooperation projects in the creation of systems for the hardware platform of the ‚ÄúBaikal-T1‚Äù processor (32-bit MIPS). <br><br>  The developers are confident that their computers will find widespread use in domestic enterprises, which place high demands on the reliability and security of IT infrastructure components and are interested in import substitution programs. <br><br>  The initial sales volume is planned from 1000 computers per month, for the next two years there is an intention to increase it to 10,000 thousand per month, Iksmedia <a href="http://www.iksmedia.ru/news/5566560-Idet-rabota-nad-pervym-rossijskim.html">reports</a> .  For the Russian market, these are very significant volumes: here we cannot do without large state orders. <br><br>  The cost of one computer will be from 35,000 rubles, it will depend on the configuration and additional options that customers will need, manufacturers say. <br><br>  According to the developers, the processors "Baikal-T1" provide "high performance and stability of industrial high-powered computers that can be used in any conditions both inside the production premises and outside.  This is a system for industrial automation with low power consumption, vibration resistance and shock resistance.  The computer has protection according to several standards, it is able to work in adverse conditions with high moisture, dust and dirt. " <br><br>  The system is proposed to be used in CNC machines, in managing processes in factories or in smart homes, in robotics, in street traffic lights, etc. If necessary, computers will be equipped with internal heaters and work in northern conditions, for example, on oil platforms. <br><br>  The operating systems of the Alt family create a safe environment for working with corporate data using built-in information protection tools, the manufacturing company has FSTEC licenses for the development and production of confidential information protection tools, as well as technical protection activities for confidential information. <br><br>  Start of mass production of a new industrial computer is scheduled for the end of May 2019.  The pilot sample HR-IC-01 will be presented on March 5, 2019 in Yakutsk as part of the so-called start-up tour of the Skolkovo Foundation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441756/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441756/</a></p>
