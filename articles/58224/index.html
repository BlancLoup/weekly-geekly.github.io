The man who invented the iPod</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://iphone-gid.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/steve-jobs.jpg"><br>  Stephen Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco on February 24, 1955, raised in California in a foster family.  His adoptive mother worked in an accounting company, and his father was a mechanic.  At the request of the biological mother, Stephen went to college. <br>  At age 12, Steven Jobs phoned HP CEO William Hewlett and asked him for the parts he needed to assemble some kind of instrument.  After talking with the boy, William sent him everything he needed and invited him to his company to work on holidays.  It was then that the fate of Jobs decided while working at <b>Hewlett-Packard,</b> he met <b>Stephen Wozniak</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4cd/811/79c/4cd81179c7513f3807e3afd7a9364cc1.jpg"><br><h5>  Steve Wozniak (right) and Steve Jobs (left) at the dawn of Apple Computer </h5><br><br>  After receiving a secondary education, Jobs was hired by Atari, a very large then computer games developer, and was able to save money for a trip to India, which he had long dreamed of. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/244/79a/9f2/24479a9f22e7e5ce711e6d923055e4d5.jpg">

      Being 5 years older than Jobs, Wozniak had already brilliantly understood computers, and he and Stephen and Ronald Wayne, <b>Atari</b> , founded Apple Computer Co. on April 1, 1976. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/08c/c40/90e/08cc4090e3c9abd61efce834346c20c3.jpg"><br><h5>  <b>Apple I</b> , <b>Apple</b> 's first computer </h5><br><br>  The company name was coined by Jobs.  Firstly, the guys wanted to choose a provocative title (at that time there was a record company with a similar name, those who were fond of the Beatles know), and secondly, Steve just loved apples. <br><br><img src="http://img211.imageshack.us/img211/994/apple.png"><br><br>  The first computer of the company was Apple I, which sold for $ 666.66.  In total 600 such cars were sold.  But real success came with the advent of Apple II, designed for a wider range of users.  Computers spread, bringing huge profits to the company.  Apple began to grow and in 1980 became a joint stock company and conducted a successful initial public offering, with the result that <b>Steve Jobs became a millionaire in 25 years</b> .  Things of the company went up sharply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba3/04b/599/ba304b599e4c2372e4c34b92d3f76019.jpg"><br><br>  1983 Jobs convinces John Scully to move from Pepsi-Cola to Apple.  Then, as a result of the conflict between them, Steve Jobs himself was removed from project management and was forced to leave Apple. <br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/ru/3/30/Pixar_logo.gif"><br>  In 1986, he buys The Graphics Group from George Lucas, renames it <b>Pixar</b> .  Under him, the studio produces cartoon films ‚ÄúToy Story‚Äù, ‚ÄúMonsters' Corporation‚Äù and others.  Jobs then sells to <b>Disney Studios</b> . <br><br><img src="http://img78.imageshack.us/img78/5665/monstersincforthebirdsw.jpg" alt="image"><br><h5>  <b>For The Birds</b> - perhaps the coolest short film Pixar </h5><br><br>  Only in 1997, Steve Jobs became the interim executive director of Apple and closes several unprofitable projects of the company, then the light saw the iMac.  With the advent of iMac, sales of Apple computers began to increase.  In 2000, Jobs becomes a full-fledged executive director and enters the book of records as a manager with the smallest salary of $ 1 (!!!) per year. <br><br><img src="http://gigapple.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/ipod1g.jpg"><br><h5>  First generation <b>iPod</b> player </h5><br>  In 2000, the first iPod appeared.  A few years later, the sale of the iPod became the main source of income for the company.  Under the leadership of Jobs, Apple has significantly strengthened its position in the personal computer market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/457/25d/bdc/45725dbdc0df161ef078acdb4e003c85.jpg"><br><h5>  Jobs and his famous brainchild </h5><br><br>  Steve continues to sell a huge number of Macs, phones and players, remaining one of the models of IT-business. <br><br>  <s>PS: The article was written for the blog "IT-biography", but for lack of sufficient karma publish here.</s> <br>  <b>UPD:</b> Thanks for the karma, moved to the right blog </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/58224/">https://habr.com/ru/post/58224/</a></p>
