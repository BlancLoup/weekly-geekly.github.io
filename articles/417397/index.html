But seriously, now in the industry everything is so confusing with logic and conclusions, so much marketing and water that the most advantageous strategy is to turn on our own brains and make an express reassessment of the technical values ‚Äã‚Äãto which we are so used.  In the post, I will try to as clearly as possible orient the developers who are beginning their careers on the risks of choosing technologies and make the right and far (far away) reaching conclusions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Have you matured or not yet? </h3><br>  Children differ from adults in the understanding of the word "responsibility".  Unfortunately, not all children grow up on time, and some of them die in diapers.  There is nothing terrible here - except for one thing: children in a team of programmers make others suffer a lot, especially when the deadlines are on and the release is close: either they are suddenly dressed in the middle of an open space, or they require a nipple during the brainstorming of the subject area with client representatives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/93/fe/--/93fe--1x3qsbunpiiwqsrfd-sl8.jpeg"><br><br>  Adults differ from children in understanding the key principle of IT management: ‚Äúprogramming is a privilege‚Äù.  Among experienced and successful fellow developers, the most adequate ones are well coded and ‚Äúmove the company forward‚Äù at the same time.

    <h3>  IT industry is crazy </h3><br>  Yes, we are human and prone to emotions.  But until now, no one knows how to properly program, although more than 50 years have passed since the invention of the computer.  No one!  Everyone is just hysterical and trying to attract more and more supporters to their camp, at the same time luring the business into creating a project for themselves :-) Let me explain with an example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jm/ar/fm/jmarfmy3lpyxyydmzqu_f7nrkqy.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  The speed of the brain </h3><br>  The fact is that the first computers worked really slowly, very slowly, and were very expensive.  Therefore, the first programs were written in very low-level languages, and sometimes directly on machine code.  Nowadays, such ‚Äúprehistoric‚Äù technologies are sometimes used, but point to point: to create operating systems and their components (close to hardware), for game engines, for high-performance libraries and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">servers</a> , for <a href="https://eos.io/">cryptocurrencies,</a> and, of course, for creating <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP">programming languages</a> . <br><br>  And if <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8_(%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">C</a> , despite its total leakiness and high danger for a developer, turned out to be really good and won the hearts of connoisseurs, then <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%252B%252B">C ++</a> turned out to be an unusually ugly and contradictory creation - but what to do is life.  Maybe <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(%25D1%258F%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">Rust</a> , with the right ideas about how to safely work with memory, will affect the situation for the better, but due to the ugliness of syntax and unreadability, it seems to have left C ++ far behind. <br><br>  The situation is further aggravated by the appearance of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go">Golang</a> .  On the one hand, there is nothing new in it, the great <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%259A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD">Ken Thompson's</a> demobilian chord: only pitiful remnants of the possibilities of Java.  On the other hand, it has become really easier to write ‚Äúrelatively‚Äù systemic and multi-threaded software, and this is a fact that <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">many companies</a> have appreciated :-) <br><br>  In this camp, you will find mostly deeply knowledgeable low-level technologies and the hardware of ‚Äúreal‚Äù hardcore bearded programmers, who taught, as a rule, one programming language - but all my life and fall asleep with the specification of the compiler instead of the wife.  Truly - in this camp cool people.  And if you don‚Äôt know on which x86 processor commands the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html">yield in python</a> is decomposed <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/reference/expressions.html">into</a> - shame on you and shame.  Therefore, the advice - avoid this camp until you finish reading to the end of the post. <br><br>  But there is a downside.  Projects here are made not only for a long time, but ... for <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">decades</a> .  Low-level programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãare not what help, but on the contrary - interfere.  Constant violations of work with memory occur, dozens and hundreds of testers are required (or you can put it on github and we will collectively test with you) and thousands of unit and other types of tests, so that <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8">‚Äúit takes off‚Äù</a> .  Many developers who joined the team at the start of projects do not live to see the release and die of old age, helping beta testers to the last breath.  But these courageous people, before bleeding from the eyes, before the appearance of stigmata, do everything possible and ... <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580)">masterpieces</a> are born. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7l/7s/na/7l7sna9ephal4my1swnrcljcaes.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Architecture and Enterprise "brain" </h3><br>  Since  still no one knows how to program properly, a camp of ‚Äúcompetent design and reliability‚Äù has been formed by natural selection.  You are crazy about programming in languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat allow unsafe memory operations through pointers - you can also bring the world to an apocalypse: "segmentation fault in the software of a nuclear reactor."  How can one begin to do a project without the support of strong typing in the language ??  And they invented the next correct programming languages: Java and C #.  But in Java they forgot about the harm of null-values, but in C # they did not fully consider backward compatibility.  The result was a huge corporate, relatively safe and relatively backward compatible world.  In this world, the goal is measured by lines of code per day (usually not more than a few dozen, for fingers are pounded into blood) and thick philosophical and religious books about design patterns and, oh yes, I almost forgot about the way to bury myself, the project, the client and the surrounding the world in the code and drown in it, remembering in the agony of the 20-level inheritance hierarchy - about the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%258A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">PLO</a> .  One of the main mottos of the camp is "why do it simply, if you can ... difficult and reliable, for a long time, for centuries!"  And some of them can still write quickly and elegantly, washing their hands with blood and collecting the structure of the project in their heads every morning, while simultaneously looking at 3 monitors.  But some people are so addicted that they continue to create hierarchies of hierarchies within hierarchies of hierarchies <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Framework">to infinity</a> - and the goal has long been lost, and the eyes continue to burn and my hands itch. <br><br>  In fact, in areas where the subject area is well settled and fits into ‚Äúobjects with status and communication between them‚Äù - this approach works very well. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0t/ic/es/0ticesmtxdhwepuh58ylllfsiuk.jpeg"><br><br>  Particularly pleased with the ‚Äústrict‚Äù (quotes, because what‚Äôs next about haskell) static typing (this is when entity types are known in advance, they are checked by the compiler and you can‚Äôt add a string to the number) ease and pleasure when refactoring and improving the code and high not to say great, the quality <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-developers/marsr">of development environments</a> .  Colleagues in this camp are often very educated in software architecture, read a lot (entry threshold is high), understand the capabilities of numerous platform libraries, design patterns, techniques for writing tons of documentation and creating automated tests, tests of these tests and can write for months the mock that will turn out not needed.  Again - often projects are being made and run for a very long time, by large teams, numerous testers are required, but the nature of errors is an order of magnitude less fatal, which is inspiring.  Getting into this "caste" of enterprise development is very difficult.  If you demonstrate how in PHP you can solve a problem in 5 lines, which your java colleagues will solve in 5 days - you will be burned alive in a microwave :-) <br><br><h3>  The reliability of the "brain" </h3><br>  In the academic environment, another camp has emerged, very interesting and recommended for understanding, and a set of functional programming languages ‚Äã‚Äã(Lisp, Haskell, Erlang, and others).  Are you crazy programming with the use of variables and cycles - you can also mess up a lot of mistakes!  A program is a set of function calls, and instead of cycles, use recursion, gentlemen!  OOP?  No, not heard - typeclasses and algebraic data types.  You do not know about <a href="https://habr.com/post/183150/">applicative functors</a> and did not leaf through the theory of categories - yes, you do not develop your own brain, my friend. <br><br>  In fact, in my opinion, in order to enter this camp and understand its values, you need to strain your brains sooo much - for mathematics will be a sea and even more unexpected, but wonderful concepts.  The experience gained in this team will be invaluable and will be useful when working with other programming languages.  It is said that someone sometimes uses functional languages ‚Äã‚Äãin real projects: compilers, <a href="https://www.cardano.org/en/home/">cryptocurrencies</a> - undoubtedly, your projects will be orders of magnitude smaller than logical errors that the compiler will catch, and the conciseness and clarity and conciseness of the Haskell code, of course, is amazing - but in the era of ‚Äúlaputena!‚Äù the number of those who study and understand this beauty is becoming less and less. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3o/em/yk/3oemykavh9fcg1mrwpl-xerzhtk.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  The result and the effectiveness of the "brain" </h3><br>  To hell with architecture and PLO, brother!  Cthulhu loves you, and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">duck typing</a> is the key to success!  Strong typing?  And who in their right mind would assign a string to the number ??  Static typing and compilation is a waste of time, because the code is written once and if you don‚Äôt have time to write it for release, it will be thrown away (and thrown away anyway, but a little later).  Refactoring?  Immediately write correctly :-) Encapsulation?  Put a dash in front of the variable name <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1%25D1%258A%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_Python">and everything</a> .  OOP is a re-complication without need.  What the hell compilation - F5 and see the result.  Design patterns - no, you have not heard: our scripting is all ... Do you want to be weed? <br><br>  The most interesting thing is that when you delve into languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith dynamic typing (strict in python, non-strict in php and javascript), you gradually open your eyes to the real picture of things, because: <br><br><ul><li>  the code becomes very clear and concise and does not need to climb up to 20 classes (if it does not concern the system libraries) </li><li>  you can quickly check the idea through the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/REPL">REPL</a> </li><li>  Languages ‚Äã‚Äãare simple, often minimalist, contain necessary and powerful primitives (lists, dictionaries), which, most importantly, are placed in your head! </li><li>  there is a cloud of libraries and you can always solve any problem in 5 lines </li></ul><br>  And to hell with refactoring :-) Life has become more fun (I hope the developer who supports my code will not know where I live).  In this camp, you will often find many cheerful people of completely different specialties, apart from ‚Äúprogramming in assembler‚Äù, who are able, nevertheless, very quickly and efficiently, in 5 lines to solve problems and to maintain code and web projects for a long time and successfully. <br><br>  Look at the latest trends in this camp and imbued with this philosophy of happiness.  Simple and clear <a href="http://jupyter.org/">programming environment in the browser</a> , well, what could be sexier? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dw/nw/wz/dwnwwziq0pwfdvpmctmbeyajy9w.png"><br><br>  And how easy is it to raise a non-blocking web server that serves thousands of connections in 10 lines per <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a> and the community grows by leaps and bounds? <br><br>  And no ‚ÄúEclipse XML Soap Entiny beans enterprise OOP ...‚Äù - json and csv and smile (and the smell of an unknown plant).  At the same time, the code is read and placed in the brain, and therefore, it works happily for a long time and is supported with the same ease for many years. <br><br>  And it turns out that ‚Äúso‚Äù can also be successfully programmed and the years spent in ‚Äúindustrial programming languages‚Äù are lived in vain (but the fingers became stronger). <br><br><h3>  Technology selection </h3><br>  Are you in shock?  So do I.  And imagine the amazement of the customers who choose the technology for the implementation of a business project!  :-) <br><br>  I think you are well aware at the moment that the IT world has really gone crazy and lost (joke).  Some programming languages, such as Scala, are trying to sit on all the chairs, but this is not yet very successful with them - it becomes difficult to understand the code to mere mortals.  But seriously, the competition of programming paradigms will only intensify because ... the tasks in the projects are completely different and it is from the tasks that you need to ‚Äúdance‚Äù!  In an up-to-date domain (servers, libraries), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system">nominal typing</a> (C ++, Java, C # ...) is better suited, somewhere it will be better with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system">structural typing</a> (Golang, Haskell ...), and in web scripting or machine tasks learning will come true happiness with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">duck</a> (python, php, javascript ...).  No need to think that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">static typing</a> , especially strict, is directly ‚Äúmust have‚Äù - you will fail the deadlines and the code with a satisfied paranoid thought about ‚Äúpossible errors‚Äù will be thrown into the garbage.  On the web, scripting and machine learning, you can confidently move forward at high speeds and with dynamic duck typing and php and python with a huge number of excellent and <a href="http://www.numpy.org/">powerful libraries.</a> This is a good example. <br><br>  So forget about ‚Äúwhat to learn programming language in 2018‚Äù to hell: <br><br><ul><li>  Understand the programming paradigms (OOP can be a grave, or it can save you a project) </li><li>  understand the subtleties of typing and the associated risks and opportunities (you can damn dynamic typing in the financial library, or sacrifice Cthulhu of a java programmer and rewrite it 100 classes on 100 lines in a script that even children can understand) </li><li>  understand the algorithms at the level of intuition (you need to distinguish search from sorting, and a neural network from logistic regression - and to understand further, you have to learn ... all your life, but it's worth it) </li><li>  understand that experienced developers (although no one knows where to find them on the market) will implement the project on almost any technology (even on a brainfuck) and do it well, but the inexperienced will have to choose a programming language with the most comfortable level of entry and risks of collapse great anyway </li></ul><br>  Next, select the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtasks that you will be interested in doing, for example the web or machine learning and: <br><br><ul><li>  look at what people solve these problems </li><li>  scatter according to the criteria above the risks and opportunities of each instrument </li><li>  Sit a couple of weekends with 1-3 specific tools, but not up to bigotry or specifications. </li><li>  quickly get down to business and gain experience in the use of tools in practice - this is the most important thing </li><li>  There is no need to learn the programming language ‚Äúto the end‚Äù - better learn the way to solve your problem in the 5 most popular tools in 10-15 lines and you will in fact be extremely adequate! </li></ul><br><h3>  Case Study - ML </h3><br>  Suppose you are interested in machine learning ... Congratulations!  On the one hand, there is an academic theory - but you have to get the essence of mathematical statistics and linear algebra out of it and in no case hang on many months of courses (get off, believe me, crazy if you are not a mathematician, but a humanitarian ).  On the other hand, you need to learn how to quickly write useful code and solve a puzzle in 5-15 lines.  Yes, you can write everything in C years after 10,000, so you look at the experience of colleagues and choose, correctly, python, which has a lot of libraries and ready-made solutions on this topic.  You devote a couple of days off to studying python - there‚Äôs nothing more to learn, the language is very simple (and we agreed not to go into the wilds, because time is money). <br><br>  Additionally, read about the essence of numpy, pandas, scikit-learn and, if eyes are burning straight, then Keras and go ahead, make projects.  But you can go the other way, long, difficult and leading to personal holiness and social poverty (you will understand the essence of the algorithm after 3 years selling newspapers in the train, but it can be such a special way) - start implementing the algorithms yourself, with manual memory management, or introduce a <a href="https://deeplearning4j.org/">heavier</a> solution and bury the code for months.  The wrong tool is the key to sleepless nights and wasted time ‚Äî avoid complexity by all means. <br><br>  An improperly chosen tool, even the most popular one, even as a free gift, even if it is theoretically possible for everyone in the future, can ruin a project for you by failing all the deadlines.  Minimize this risk as much as you can and cannot. <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  So, friends, we were convinced with you that no one knows how to program correctly and successfully, even we, the developers :-) The competition of programming paradigms and technologies is increasing, the head swells, and the free time becomes less and less.  Therefore, the most winning strategy of a developer who starts his career is to drink a jar of cool beer, relax and: <br><br><ul><li>  avoid sticking and immersion in excessive technological details, the number of which is growing exponentially </li><li>  choose an interesting task area in which you are interested in solving customers' tasks </li><li>  learn to extract from the tools and programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãshort and erotic essence </li><li>  write as little as possible, but clear and understandable to you and the people around you </li><li>  learn how to solve problems in 5-15 lines, not 20-50 classes </li><li>  if you want to go somewhere else, then let it be fundamental things like math, haskell or rfc by tcp / ip </li><li>  get the pleasure of programming and warm them to your colleagues! </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q6/5v/bf/q65vbfeuvwoonhkpcvkl6zk281m.jpeg"><br><br>  And always remember that time, especially free, is a valuable resource and it depends on us where to invest it.  Good luck to everyone and good mood! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417397/">https://habr.com/ru/post/417397/</a></p>
