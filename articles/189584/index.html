  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Between Samsung Galaxy S III and OPPO Find 5 (quite a bit more about the latter)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Choosing a new gadget, we, logically, want it to be better and more interesting than the old one.  For someone it is important that the device corresponds to the tendencies, someone must have a large number of cores and a more powerful graphics component, someone relies on the camera, including me.  And we are all in search of Himself!  I almost found it - OPPO Find 5 turned out to be, however, in some ways my Samsung Galaxy S III turned out to be better, so I postponed the purchase.  Yet Find 5 conquered me.  Want to know what? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/713/688/8f0/7136888f0532a8edc493db2b00319c19.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>Selection criteria or how girls choose</b> </h4> I belong to the small category of people who do not want to buy all the new items on the mobile market.  What is important to me is that the gadget answers all my requests, namely: <br>  1) Was nice (I'm a girl =)) <br>  2) Served me faithfully for as long as possible <br>  3) was quick <br>  4) Had a big screen (I personally can‚Äôt imagine how it can be convenient to type text on a 4.3 inch screen) <br>  5) Loud speaker (very important in a noisy city, especially in Moscow) <br>  6) Fun interface (phishing device, a bunch of settings, interactive shell) <br>  7) The most important thing is the camera!  (I have repeatedly said in reviews that I love to photograph everything around me, especially since it is sometimes easier to take a smartphone with you than a huge bandura half a kilo or more) <br><br>  And here is my Samsung Galaxy S III perfectly fits all criteria.  However, we all know that modern smartphones do not live for a long time (no, if you are only calling on the device or it was released in some distant 2008, then I am sure that it is more alive than all the living!) And you can‚Äôt get away from the new purchase .  So a year later I began to think that it would be great (although not necessary) to purchase a new smartphone, but since there is no special need for this, these thoughts remained thoughts until I became acquainted with the OPPO brand and its flagship Find 5. Moreover, the manufacturer assures that the device is no worse than the modern flagships SGS4, HTC One and Sony Xperia Z. And why OPPO, and not Samsung, HTC or Sony?  And maybe Nokia?  And now there will be a typically female answer - because!  The answer is this: there are a lot of not very flattering comments from journalists on SGS3 who know the gadgets well;  I never liked htc and that's it;  Nokia is a closed OS (actually, like the iPhone), and Sony Xperia Z does not make very high quality cards, and its design is rather coarse, somehow it did not catch.  And OPPO looks like it‚Äôs not banal, not glossy plastic, but a matte soft-touch, it has white color and in general it is beautiful!  He also has an unlock screen with a cute cat (but more on that below). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/033/268/75a/03326875af08623e9a465dedb075dc2d.jpg"><br>  Therefore OPPO.  I wanted him!  But before running to the store, yielding to emotions, I decided to take advantage of the reviewer's privilege and take the coveted machine to the test to weigh all the "FOR" and "AGAINST".  Yes, you say, what to weigh - went and bought, once you want and like.  But I have been walking with this device for a long time!  And I don‚Äôt want to buy a gadget that I‚Äôll get tired of later on after 2 months.  In general, they somehow instilled in me that everything must be approached wisely and not to be wasted on trifles.  Oh, it‚Äôs not in that steppe, let's talk about a smartphone ...

    <h4>  <b>Appearance and equipment</b> </h4><br>  The box at OPPO Find 5 is made in black.  Cover on the magnet.  Inside, we see a bath for a smartphone, and below it is standard equipment - headphones, microUSB cable, charger unit, a key for removing the micro-SIM slot and documentation. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eab/77f/25e/eab77f25e5ead2f4953d0e8d826b32cd.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/087/ce1/e5a/087ce1e5a5b3415965c9666c9bfec8a6.jpg"><br><br>  As I said, I like the appearance of OPPO Find 5. <br>  It has a solid body, pleasant to the touch.  The entire front side is occupied by a screen (Gorilla Glass 2) with a small white plastic strip at the bottom. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cdb/27e/002/cdb27e002cb42f9dc0444991c5e0aecc.jpg"><br>  The back side is equipped with a 13 megapixel camera, dual flash, a microphone (for noise reduction), a speaker and the word OPPO. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/981/d4d/f49/981d4df4915a93839827a1f8af03cb2d.jpg"><br><br>  If to compare with SGS3, then it looks, of course, more stylish (oh, and I don‚Äôt like this word, but it fits well here!).  They are almost identical in size, but Samsung seems thicker. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/947/aff/09b/947aff09b15c225d686143c11cb08aa4.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b1/b9d/a27/5b1b9da278c0cbb82804b90bea6cc97c.jpg"><br><br>  The edges of Find 5 are pointed, SGS3 - rounded. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/69c/3e1/a32/69c3e1a3294715ae0cc15453622c680d.jpg"><br><br>  You can watch the screen off, like in a mirror, on both smartphones :) Oh, do not say that you never did it - didn't you look smart in a mirror? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8ec/e18/71f/8ece1871faafb6eebd24d2d6568b6af8.jpg"><br><br>  On top of the front panel there is a 2 megapixel camera, proximity sensors and light. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c15/071/fc2/c15071fc289291c6336d85de97cd8647.jpg"><br><br>  Below - control keys, carried under the screen.  They are not burning very brightly, they very easily react to touches, which causes some inconvenience when typing - they are located close to the screen and the frames themselves around the screen are so small that it is very easy to make a couple of extra taps. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42e/a91/080/42ea910800c46d456386176bbdfb0dd8.jpg"><br><br>  On the right "side" are the volume keys.  Groping easily. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d45/b47/62f/d45b4762f3f3a8e3637545f12bb7fc68.jpg"><br>  On the left - the power key and the micro-SIM compartment <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac7/171/458/ac717145889112ca869799bd0c6e629c.jpg"><br>  Here is a strange arrangement of keys, usually the power button on the right, and the volume keys on the left. <br><br>  At the bottom there is a microUSB port and a microphone, at the top there is a 3.5 mm headphone input <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/549/d72/151/549d721511f64d9f0a3bf0a4cf236aa8.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c4a/334/7de/c4a3347dead27b3290431e433ac8d810.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Screen</b> </h4>  Now the Full HD screen does not surprise the tempted gadzhetomana, but still not many smartphones can boast a resolution of 1920 by 1080 pixels.  Is that the flagships.  But quite recently (in November 2012) the first smartphone in Russia with a Full HD screen was introduced - the Sharp Aquos Phone 930, remember this?  He has not yet had a normal optimization, and few games have been adapted for Full HD.  Now, high-resolution smartphones are not enough to work smartly, they can also work a day on one battery!  In what progress has reached!  =) <br><br>  I like the screen - juicy, bright, and not so acidic (I've never noticed before, to be honest), like my SGS3 - the difference is felt after three days of using Find 5. <br>  Yes, even if you put them side by side and put one picture on the screen, the difference is felt.  But I cannot absolutely determine what I like more AMOLED or IPS <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9a/061/0c3/f9a0610c356151ddd0a437835bc187a0.jpg"><br><br>  Viewing angles are good.  Brightness only now I would like more.  And the ability to adjust the brightness of the quick settings panel. <br><br>  The gorilla (which is Glass) protects the display from scratching and attacking keys, hairbrushes, scissors, and other handbag monsters.  But, I think, over time, the defense will be slightly broken.  Judging by its SGS3, whose gorilla is ‚Äúolder‚Äù, but which just passed the defense after a month of use. <br><br>  10 touches, voila! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3ba/915/5de/3ba9155de232cfa5a3a6c6f991ab65f4.png"><br><br><h4>  <b>Shell</b> </h4>  One of the OPPO Find 5 chips I can safely call its original shell - this is not bare Android, but very beautiful, I would even say an ‚Äúinteractive‚Äù cover.  You can easily find an overview of this shell on the Internet, for example, here <a href="http://keddr.com/2013/08/color-rom-luchshaya-storona-oppo-find-5/">keddr.com/2013/08/color-rom-luchshaya-storona-oppo-find-5</a> But I would like to dwell on what hooked me and what, I think it will be interesting to users. <br><br>  <i><u>Many themes</u> .</i> <br>  Oh, well, this is any android there, the skeptic will say.  Any, I agree.  Yes, only I have never thought for a year to update the design theme of my phone.  Although no, I'm lying, I thought, I went to the Play Market, I introduced ‚ÄúTheme Design‚Äù and hung up - well, somehow not very, to be honest.  Nothing.  Maybe I'm looking bad?  But the whole thing and the thing to look for is to write something right, read about it somewhere ... And in Find 5 everything is simple - there is a special label, click on it and, voila, three sections - wallpapers, themes and lock screen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c78/a74/bbd/c78a74bbd1bd6272468fb58266668eaf.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/826/b0f/693/826b0f693d28c9a2169fb88957b15206.png"><br><br>  All clearly, with screenshots.  Everything is beautiful and bright.  Well, straight soul rejoices.  Actually, what did I do, how did I get the Find 5 test?  That's right, set yourself a new theme and a lock screen with a cute cat =) <br>  Labels, by the way, also vary depending on the topic.  Straight and not learn some! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/210/4ae/8b4/2104ae8b426ccde57529ad20d1878ec0.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/29d/8b1/692/29d8b16925723957557b81ee59534d2f.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/88a/490/adb/88a490adb9f553e719a8b93a7f2f5e33.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9d/d1a/52f/c9dd1a52f95de2d5c92cad790a3a2dda.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26d/82b/d92/26d82bd923287195e3dbac7c5777f2df.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a0/cb7/421/1a0cb742105a3961f5e1cf37eedd1b33.png"><br><br>  Cats are my passion, but here is such a cute cat swinging from side to side, flying on a rocket, eating jam and stomping on a soft pad.  And when you need to unlock the screen, you need to hold on the track and the cat will leave on a scooter.  Well, straight mimic! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb8/5e4/75c/eb85e475cbc02dd8f075d83b45ef4201.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0e8/28c/66c/0e828c66c24d8a35912d2d39e7a1922a.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/464/bf5/917/464bf59175a4383feab2ec769f3dd08d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eb4/462/f68/eb4462f68caadaa70e5343a43380ebf0.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf2/a08/74f/bf2a0874f56c7b9cc4b67faed5e186eb.png"><br><br>  <i><u>Popup SMS messages</u></i> <br>  Perhaps (yes, I'm pretty sure) this function is often found in smartphones, but for me it was a revelation.  You sit, say, on Twitter, you receive a message and it is displayed in a small window right in the middle of the screen, while the application in which you sit does not go into the background and does not close.  And you can read the entire message and even respond to it.  Or just close this window and continue to continue to do what he did before - read twitter or watch a movie. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/16a/e08/499/16ae08499e2ec02ce7a1fb3237ae0523.png"><br>  It seems to me that this option is very convenient, since you don‚Äôt need to exit the application, make extra movements to open a window with a message and read the entire text.  In my SGS3 messages come and are displayed in the notification blind.  To read completely, you need to open the curtain, poke at the message, the message will open in the standard message window.  And here at once read. <br><br>  The rest of the message menu is standard, only it looks, of course, more beautiful. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fa7/428/5a0/fa74285a0687382b1fcfbc42273e76a6.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/98f/e4b/10d/98fe4b10d0d1d3953cb76852150cbe08.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/66a/5c8/888/66a5c8888630d7b81b64fb630b0de60e.png"><br><br>  <i><u>Gestures</u></i> <br>  Not many smartphones can boast of these "gestural" functions. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a45/3f9/3f7/a453f93f764d61099c1d59222ac72381.png"><br><br>  <i><u>Instant photo</u></i> <br>  Widget on the desktop in the form of a polaroid card by clicking on which you start the camera and you can immediately take a photo, which will appear below the card, framed by a frame.  You can create a whole chronology of photos and immediately send these photos with captions to friends. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbd/f0a/631/dbdf0a631e8a28dc93da3fde1f5d5b9f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9eb/4ee/fcf/9eb4eefcfb21032344db6c91f52789d7.png"><br>  Not to say what you need, but it seems to me funny. <br><br>  <i><u>Feedback directly in the phone</u></i> <br>  OPPO Find 5 has a built-in Feedback application that allows you to send questions directly to a technical support specialist via the Internet.  And do not call. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ee9/3d8/64c/ee93d864cf35c78c705d6822cdae5a70.png"><br><br>  <i><u>The ability to save data to the "cloud"</u></i> <br>  An account is created that allows you to save your data ‚Äî photos, music, text documents, etc. ‚Äî to network storage. <br><br><h4>  <b>Standard Applications</b> </h4>  There are not many pre-installed applications - almost everything is from Google, but there is also Facebook, Kingsoft Office, NearMeCloud (an application that allows you to shower data from your phone into the cloud and store it there).  Otherwise, everything is standard, though beautifully drawn.  So just attaching screenshots. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ce8/581/dcf/ce8581dcf942146fa945bfd977a1d8e5.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/26c/e0d/8ad/26ce0d8ad1bb1337d9890a4a4fddf190.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/48b/d5f/3d1/48bd5f3d11a2adb20f8a49027a7a901e.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/956/baa/89a/956baa89a07051ec778ec59fd864e939.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/716/709/12f/71670912fdaa89009dc763aaa5176f6c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/23b/131/e4a/23b131e4ab32480834c54dd2584f9395.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a49/716/763/a497167636ba9cd8e940a26b96b703de.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb9/63f/86c/fb963f86cbc6dc5e9219a49db845a0e2.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc0/ade/b6b/cc0adeb6b7adeb6301ffff940398dbef.png"><br><br>  The settings are quite extensive, divided into three sections: ‚ÄúGeneral‚Äù, ‚ÄúAudio‚Äù and ‚ÄúScreen‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/495/e79/a30/495e79a303b56d832319f3cff8d8d379.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/93c/802/7a9/93c8027a93ead0cc1dab8b1ad7778f0f.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b7/05c/716/3b705c71645e22f91893495f8ca7ffa7.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/033/573/f8f/033573f8f820ddb40507b10b4c1b6760.png"><br><br>  In the notification curtain, by the way, information about how much traffic you pumped is displayed.  There is no such thing in SGS3, and I haven‚Äôt met this yet in other Android smartphones.  By the way, the quick settings line can also be customized. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb2/852/599/fb28525999426fff2ad866ef860e0f19.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/73a/229/e98/73a229e98e83c2235b07aa9a05bdc794.png"><br><br>  Video player loses without problems files larger than 2 GB.  At least, I watched the illusion of deception in HD quality without any problems.  But I am not a special supporter of watching films on such small diagonals.  If you watch the movie, then on the big screen, and better - in the cinema.  But this is my opinion. <br><br><h4>  <b>Performance</b> </h4>  OPPO Find 5 runs on a 4-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 processor with a frequency of 1.5 GHz, Adreno 320 is responsible for the graphics, 2 GB of RAM.  All this should ensure the smoothness and stability of the device.  In principle, the way it is.  There were no jams or freezes.  In general, this apparatus will seem quick and fast to a simple inhabitant :) But for those who love numbers, I attach the test results: <br>  Antutu - 20,974 <br>  Quadrant - 7570 <br>  Vellamo - 1 743 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/113/4c4/10a/1134c410a5135d160435c98f43ad397d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/37d/a28/04b/37da2804b3462bb09fe38b210525b9e1.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d2/7b8/afe/3d27b8afec00f24372ce9c7b35af11be.png"><br><br>  About the games.  I'm not a gamer, so a powerful machine that supports 3D games I somehow do not really need.  The maximum that I play is Subway Surfers.  She goes to OPPO Find 5 with a bang =) <br><br><h4>  <b>Baths</b> </h4>  Here is a 2500 mAh battery.  Having learned from the bitter experience of communicating with a smartphone with a Full HD screen (Sharp 930), which was discharged after 5 hours of intensive work, I was a bit skeptical about the battery, which is more than 400mAh battery from my SGS3 ... <br><br>  So, what we have: zadrota social networks (that is, me), constantly checking Twitter, VK, Facebook, taking photos for Instagram, checking mail and talking on the phone about an hour a day.  The Internet always works.  Plus a couple of sms. <br>  I took off the charge in the morning (at 10 o'clock) and at one o'clock in the morning the staff squeaked and chopped off the loss of the last drop of energy.  But here it is necessary to take into account that I worked for half a day and practically did not use the phone (Wi-Fi worked and there were several incoming calls) <br>  Graphics battery consumption here, by the way, no.  But you can see what the battery consumes. <br><br>  That is, with my standard load on the smartphone, it will live a little less than a day.  In principle, the Samsung Galaxy S III lives the same, although there can be attributed to the already accumulated battery. <br><br>  In general, I was pleased with the autonomy of work.  Of course, I want the smartphone to work as much as possible without sunbathing, and, I hope, such devices will soon appear, and not fat ones, such as Highscreen Boost, but quite thin and light ones. <br><br><h4>  <b>Sound</b> </h4>  The phone should be loud!  Otherwise, why bother with the phone? :) <br><br>  The speaker for the Find 5, like most phones, is located on the back of the device.  When you put the phone on the table, the sound is slightly muffled. <br><br>  I will not say that I am such a super connoisseur of high-quality music, in general, I do not understand whether the music from the speakers is of high quality or not.  Well, it sounds.  Well, I like it.  No hiss, hoarse speakers did not notice.  So all good?  The speaker, by the way, is loud (although this is not the Nokia N95, which you will hear in the next apartment).  Through the headphones (of course, third-party) the sound feed goes well.  There is even a special tune - ‚ÄúSound transmission through the speaker‚Äù and ‚ÄúPlay sound through the headphones‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/46b/163/d80/46b163d80b6a4c833267bdb47585c6b3.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/183/dda/97c/183dda97c218e3679b0a11bb9f8cba6d.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/966/af1/a4d/966af1a4d57ea6f032eb2fcf7c719748.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e23/e88/2bb/e23e882bb49900d9872b59a0c5cd8e9e.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ab/1e6/825/4ab1e6825d2a4b9c571a3ffe752bd0fa.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/756/3c8/c7c/7563c8c7c8745c5d829ac0da1ccc20f2.png"><br><br>  For audiophiles, there are settings for ‚ÄúDolby Effect‚Äù and ‚ÄúDirac Effect‚Äù.  I do not belong to this category of people, so I can not say anything. <br><br><h4>  <b>Camera</b> </h4>  And here it is, the stumbling block!  I like everything in OPPO Find 5 except for the camera. <br>  No, it is not terrible, but quite even nothing like that, but worse than the SGS3.  Frames turn out slightly smeared, in case of weak good lighting, they slightly ‚Äúmake noise‚Äù.  Very slightly.  Someone will say that I find fault, perhaps it is so.  But I don‚Äôt like how OPPO fotka compared to Samsung and that's it!  The only macro, I confess, he is on top! <br><br>  Camera settings, by the way, are not very many.  I would say even a little.  It is necessary to install something else.  From the base, I liked the ‚ÄúBeautiful Face‚Äù effect - all acne, bumps and even freckles are removed: D However, upon detailed and close examination, the so-called ‚Äútonal layer‚Äù is noticeable, which covers all the flaws. <br>  Main camera setup: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0be/fbd/03b/0befbd03bfc640357b754cdab3818a4a.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55d/b15/72a/55db1572a39dd404466bbbc5e5c46fc5.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/17d/8ec/3e3/17d8ec3e32491d43837769bb792a8161.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c5/247/267/6c524726734f0649bf52d42e82c67fd5.png"><br><br>  Front camera setup: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/61d/30b/2cf/61d30b2cf36bd32ed4446e6b77153434.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa2/7aa/d84/aa27aad84ef9253f9527e9e580cdc424.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Examples of photos (carefully, large photos!):</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bab/6d9/10c/bab6d910c01a5af93043d49cd2262faa.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/032/0cc/27f/0320cc27f6dd553577ea1f8f3cff0498.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc8/7e1/5a3/cc87e15a354375abb87e5b70b5ce6864.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2a8/c44/6be/2a8c446be01237b16710946af3763ade.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/269/55a/c19/26955ac197011690d67f94a85a90496f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f51/59d/baa/f5159dbaa4ea6dd50a67ca79e417e5f7.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  At first, I wanted to demonstrate the ‚ÄúBeautiful Face‚Äù effect on myself, but here I met a friend who has many, many freckles.  So this effect and freckles even removes!  True, the face seems a bit unnatural. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Photo examples:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Before <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/182/66c/481/18266c481e9a6a8672882326fea82969.jpg"><br>  After <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4e5/a42/ba2/4e5a42ba282151977e9cff427df2d5c3.jpg"></div></div><br><br>  But someone turns out to do pretty good fotochki: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/459/be9/173/459be917362afe83432b374541b51d26.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87a/816/3f7/87a8163f7a71bc3b89f09837a7b9f8e9.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Other features</b> </h4><br>  What else would you like to tell about the device? <br>  It does <b>not have a slot for microSD-cards</b> .  This means that you can not expand the memory.  Therefore, we must immediately buy the device with 32 GB of internal memory. <br><br>  With a long load, usually with games, OPPO Find 5 is <b>heated</b> .  Not much, of course, but heated.  I, in principle, do not care.  In winter, even good - you can warm your cold nose.  By the way, it also heats up from connecting to the computer. <br><br>  When you connect your smartphone to your computer, you will see a notification prompting you to choose one of the three modes ‚ÄúCharging Only‚Äù, ‚ÄúDrive‚Äù (then your phone will be visible on your computer as removable dix) and ‚ÄúMultimedia Mode‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt know if the ‚ÄúOnly charge‚Äù function is needed?  How do you think?  I think this is too much. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8ea/4f4/1a4/8ea4f41a456e892bf9ab98d39afe5dc5.png"><br><br>  Right from the Gallery you can switch to the photographing mode - there is a corresponding line at the bottom.  Trifle, but nice. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/628/d2a/3cc/628d2a3cc11e8abe5301646b36ff0959.png"><br><br>  For OPPO Find 5, new firmware is periodically released, which is developed together with users.  So, the latest version (albeit still beta) of the firmware called Color ROM modifies the appearance of the phone.  Actually, it is in this shell that the bulk of the chips I described above are contained.  Firmware can be downloaded on the official website of OPPO.  Install is not difficult.  I did it. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac8/77d/3b0/ac877d3b0e60fb6569310d7be2508dd0.png"><br><br>  Svaypa a priori, no.  Those who switch from Samsung will be quite difficult to get used to.  Either search and install the svayp (this procedure was not given to me). <br><br>  Ah, micro-SIM is inserted here.  And it is inserted in a clever way - with the help of a special key, a bath for a sim is pulled out.  If you lose the key, then the usual clip will do, IMHO. <br><br><h4>  <b>Almost hero, but not mine</b> </h4>  OPPO Find 5 - the first smartphone after, in fact, the Samsung Galaxy S III, which I wanted to buy myself.  He has almost everything perfect - design, shell, autonomy, speed of work.  But there is one thing I can‚Äôt put up with, well, no way - the camera.  Well, something scares me in it.  Perhaps it‚Äôs about the same color of the screen, perhaps my inner voice tells me: ‚ÄúWait a little bit, your dream smartphone will be released soon with excellent optics!‚Äù  I do not know.  But for now, I decided to postpone the purchase.  Especially since there is no special need for it.  But if there was, then maybe I did not wander and buy it?  And, probably, matter in the price?  It‚Äôs worth OPPO Find 5 for 16 GB - $ 19,990 / $ 605 (for 32 GB - $ 21,990 / $ 666).  According to the characteristics, it is, in principle, close to the flagship HTC One, Samsung Galaxy S IV and Sony Xperia Z, which cost 5-6 thousand more.  But still, a company that is virtually unknown in the market could have made the price even less.  Although, if you look at their prices in China, the difference between ours and their prices is small ... <br><br>  In general, I‚Äôll wait for the weather by the sea when the OPPO comes out with a new smartphone with a better camera (and they say it‚Äôs really some cool camera) or when something attacks me, let me go and buy this Find 5. And while I sit with the Samsung Galaxy S III and it seems not bad :) <br><br><h4>  <b>Summing up:</b> </h4>  <b>Pros:</b> <br>  design <br>  original shell (not naked Android, yupi!) <br>  Full HD screen <br>  loud speaker <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br>  camera <br>  no memory card slot <br>  narrow sides around the screen and too close keys to the screen because of what often happens extra pressure <br><br>  PS If you forgot to mention something - write in the comments, the device is still on hand, so I can add a review :) Although, it seems to me, there are so many multi-books :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/189584/">https://habr.com/ru/post/189584/</a></p>
