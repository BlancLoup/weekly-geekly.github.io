We had doubts about what would eventually turn out when ETC (Evernote Trunk Conference) was announced, but we liked the result. <br><br>  People came, a lot of people (more than 400, more precisely).  Evernote users, fans, developers and partners filled the three-story Terra SF building in San Francisco, where they spent the whole day at our conference. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Big announcements and reports </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/171/990/38a/17199038abbaada0a4ab28ba9de33537.png"><br>  At the event, we officially announced the acquisition of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/evernote/blog/126633/">Skitch</a> (now you can get this application in the Mac App Store for free, as well as download to your <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/evernote/blog/126637/">Android device</a> ).  It seems that people love Skitch as much as we do, since this news appeared even among the current Twitter topics soon after the announcement. <br><br>  During the day, a number of notable people made presentations, such as Tim Ferriss and Gordon Bell, prominent users, including Michael Hyatt and Carly Knobloch, as well as the finalists of our developer competition.  We talked about the Evernote architecture with our technical director, discussed ways to create a successful application and a solution that could help companies achieve the next level of growth.

    <h3>  Developer Competition </h3><br>  During the event, we also summed up our <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/etc/vote.php">first developer competition</a> .  Three winners were chosen from more than 1,000 participants.  The prize fund was distributed in three categories: Grand Prix, Student Prize and Creative Prize ($ 50,000 $ 10,000 and $ 10,000, respectively).  Each of the six candidates to win the Grand Prix presented its application to ETC guests and viewers from around the world with the help of UStream.  The voices of the spectators were combined with the voices of the community and the judges, and as a result we determined the owner of the main prize.  You can <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/evernote/blog/125031/">read about each of our wonderful finalists</a> .  We want to congratulate them all! <br><br>  <strong>Grand Prix Winner at $ 50,000: Touchanote</strong> <br>  <em>Developer: Wiseleap Solutions, Montreal, Canada</em> <br>  <a href="http://www.evernote.com/about/etc/touchanote.php">Touchanote</a> is an Android application that allows you to link objects from real life with notes in Evernote.  A bundle with Evernote provides physical NFC-tags - contactless technology, which is usually referred to as the most convenient means for implementing a mobile wallet.  The note is opened by simply touching the label with a phone that supports this technology.  You can display your to-do list by putting the phone on the desktop, tag all your devices and link them with notes containing serial numbers and instructions, or stick an NFC sticker on your luggage, linking it to the list of necessary things to travel to Evernote. <br><br>  <strong>The winner of the prize for creativity: Read-along Bookvids</strong> <br>  <em>Developer: Arlo Faria, Berkeley, California</em> <br>  Read-along bookvids is an application that allows you to automatically turn a static book into an animated video, where pages are synchronized with audio.  Just take a photo of the pages in the book and read the book out loud, recording the voice in the form of audio notes.  And that's all.  Put all your notes in notepad and try a new way to ‚Äúread‚Äù a book.  The use of image recognition technology Evernote along with speech recognition from Read along allows the application to determine when it is time to ‚Äúturn‚Äù the page. <br><br>  <strong>Student Prize Winner: Desk in the Clouds</strong> <br>  <em>Developer: Bernard Caspar, University of Applied Sciences, Berlin, Germany</em> <br>  <a href="http://www.deskintheclouds.com/">Desk in the Clouds</a> is a web-based and Mac client application that allows you to create a personalized view of your most important notes.  Drag notes from your Evernote account to a virtual table where you can change their position and order.  This is reminiscent of the creation of a thematic collage, a mood palette from your content in Evernote.  Placing notes on your "table", you can edit them and even create multiple tables, adding tags to notes (for example, 'Work' or 'Cookery').  Any edits made are automatically saved and restored when you visit the site.  To get started with Desk in the Clouds, just authorize with your Evernote account. <br><br>  The evening ended with a fun party and amazing life stories with Evernote from our users. <br><br>  We want to say thank you once again to all our wonderful speakers and participants.  Thank you and our community, whose representatives in one way or another discussed ETC in various forums and other resources.  It really was a special day ... And we are already planning ETC 2012. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127043/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127043/</a></p>
