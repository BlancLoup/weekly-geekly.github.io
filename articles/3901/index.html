      You have passwords from mail, from a forum, from a habr, from LJ. <br><br>  Storage options: <br><br>  1. You remember all your passwords. <br>  2. You write your passwords to a file. <br>  3. You trust your passwords to the program, the ‚Äúpassword manager‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote>  Important point: <br>  You do not need to trust the names (URL) of the services to the manager. <br>  No one knows that you are using a password manager. <br>  No one knows which password manager you use. <br></blockquote><br>  The first option is perfect, no problem.  You trust only yourself. <br>  The second option - you trust passwords to your computer. <br>  The third option is that you trust your third-party specialized program with your passwords. <br>  This automatically means that you also trust the developer of the program. <br><br>  In the case of (1) and (2) - the unauthorized use of your passwords is exclusively your fault.  Data can disappear only from your computer. <br>  In the case of (3), the possible fault of the program developer is also added to your fault.  Passwords can "leave" and with the help of his program. <br><br>  We remember that in addition to the passwords on the user side, there are passwords (or derivatives of them) and on the side of the service that he uses. <br>  Services have different authentication systems. <br>  For services, there are various vulnerabilities that allow access to your mail, account in a diary, and so on. <br>  But there are no universal vulnerabilities that allow access to all your accounts at once. <br><br>  What does OpenID technology offer? <br><br>  In fact, after registering with the OpenID server, you have one master password suitable for all the services you use. <br><br>  There is a single standard protocol through which services are exchanged with the OpenID identification server.  Unified authentication system - on the OpenID server. <br><br>  The identity server knows absolutely all the services on which you use this OpenID. <br>  The identity server knows your master password. <br>  Services trust this OpenID server. <br>  Absolutely everyone knows which OpenID server you are using. <br><br>  It turns out that you need to keep only the master password safe (and preferably not on the computer). <br>  You can not worry - in the case of hacking (theft) of the computer, attackers will not get access to the services on which you are registered. <br><br>  In which case you will not be guilty, but the identification server. <br><br>  But will it make you any easier?  What can you demand from him? <br><br>  When using OpenID, you need to try not to think about the fact that there are no invulnerable protocols, services and servers. <br>  You just need to believe the opposite. <br><br>  The idea behind this technology is definitely a good idea. <br>  But when an idea becomes technology, it has its own field of application, its pros and cons. <br>  The question is how much the pros outweigh the cons in order to make technology standard-forming and / or universal. <br><br>  And what happens this time - we will soon find out. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3901/</a></p>
