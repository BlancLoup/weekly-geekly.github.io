Download try.  Interesting. <br><br>  <b>What is it?</b>  Watching movies in .torrent directly in the browser, right during the download. <br><br>  In short: basically it works;  better than uTorrent Stream;  only Windows (Linux and Mac ports are already in development);  amenities only for firefox;  the player itself works in both IE and Chrome too (I will describe how below);  you need to download quite a rather big .exe (32mb);  Antivir - checked KIS in the comments - everything is fine;  the player does not understand the keyboard;  there are suspicions about the future of the project (the word ‚Äúmonetization‚Äù is used too often on the site).

    <img src="http://yoihj.ru/habr/screen1.jpg"><br><br>  Download: <a href="http://torrentstream.org/ru/index.php">32MB plugin itself</a> (or <a href="http://torrentstream.net/download/%3Fproduct%3Dtsplugin%26version%3Dlatest">direct download link</a> ), <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/86092">add-in for FireFox for convenience</a> . <br><br>  Inside TorrentStream is a paradise for IT-schnick, by the way - it‚Äôs written like <b>Python 2.5 + wxWidgets + libvlc + <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribler">Tribler</a></b> (I <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribler">‚Äôm going</a></b> inside the topic a bit).  Compiled py2exe.  There are still some pieces from Lua - it's not clear what they are doing.  Actually in the unpacked form: 26mb - only Python + wxWidgets libraries + 51MB of libvlc library (codecs). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In general, debriefing: <br><br>  A plug-in for FF is being downloaded, and some other separate .exe is 32MB (not very clear - one person‚Äôs office is everything or just a plug-in add-on, everything is very similar, but on different sites). <br><br>  Restart firefox, right click on the torrent, "View torrent online". <br><br>  Films from a private Russian tracker are well played, films from foreign publications - did not wait: <br><br>  1. the first film that I tried - did not go ( <a href="http://rutracker.org/">rutreker</a> ), <br>  2. second, third - normally went (rutreker). <br>  3. a film from a public tracker (via eztv.it) has already connected to 49 peers, 0%, already five minutes pulls for 10K per second, nothing is playing for 10 minutes and still 0% ... <br>  4. from the same Lost trucker, the last one started playing for a couple of minutes with 8 peers ... <br><br>  In short: ‚Äúwe play here, we don‚Äôt play here‚Äù - is present. <br><br>  It seems that the plugin is just to appear the contextual link on the right button), to watch Chrome - just need to download the .torrent file and download it to <a href="http://torrentstream.org/ru/index.php">torrentstream.org/ru/index.php</a> <br><br>  Examples of links (with the installed player will work in both Chrome and IE): <br>  <a href="http://torrentstream.net/play.php%3Fid%3Dd02f1aed21fb1cd3625a5392d4c1317f98ca4da9">Lost last, in English</a> (plays smartly) <br>  <a href="http://torrentstream.net/play.php%3Fid%3D131f2dfe495b55692589fc3a222f448bcf81a84d">Some kind of transfer PBS</a> (did not wait for the beginning) <br><br>  Pros: <br>  - link can be given to anyone with a plugin. <br><br>  Minuses: <br>  - You can give this link to anyone, but everyone will download using your hash key and spoiling the rating on closed trackers (the link can be opened not only by the author, but by anyone). <br>  - link to a third-party resource, given the strange descriptions of "monetization" everywhere on their website - this is more than a minus ... <br><br>  * clarification: you can <b>spoil the rating</b> <b>only</b> if you yourself distribute this link to anyone.  (it's just that many people doubt that this client does not distribute - it distributes everything normally, there is a speed of return in the settings) <br><br>  Actually, what to say - the film is coming.  It starts somewhere 2-3 minutes after pressing the button.  The player is made strange, suffers from childhood diseases and possibly some incurable (no rewind). <br><br>  Pluses player: <br>  - the main thing: it <b>works!</b>  , <br>  - there is a switching audio tracks, <br>  - codecs included, even MKV. <br><br>  Children's diseases of the player: <br>  - no rewind, <br>  - there are no keyboard shortcuts (do not pause from the keyboard, nor adjust the volume), <br>  - the video size is not fine-tune - either fullscreen or 1: 1, <br>  - there is a switching of audio tracks, but for some reason there was no sound at all (?) On the second track, and the switching slows down (only after 5-10 seconds does the sound start), <br>  - in fullscreen video is uncontrollable at all (even by escape, fullscreen is not turned off, just with a mouse), <br>  - there is no restriction on eating traffic, <br>  - after closing the player another 5 minutes pulls at full speed, <br>  - traffic is not considered to be limited at all - opened the film, watched the first 10 seconds, and now it‚Äôs at 10 seconds in pause - 200 megs have already downloaded.  The truth does not pump further (700MB film). <br><br>  Plus: - movies downloaded are added to s: \ torrentstream <br>  Minus: - movies seem to be deleted when you close the player for about a minute :) <br><br> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/linder/63843550/"><img src="http://yoihj.ru/habr/monty.jpg" align="right"></a> <h4>  Monetization, speak? </h4><br>  Still embarrassed by the business ‚Äúwater‚Äù about <b>monetization</b> (the author no less than the MBA finished writing so much and not saying anything): ‚ÄúThis is a <i>comprehensive</i> Torrent Stream <i>solution</i> that <i>forms a unified system for organizing business processes</i> among users ... will <i>implement automatic integration the functionality of the</i> system .... "... so, and guess - whether the ads will show what, or what tyrit ... this, of course, guesses, just based on the fact that there is no specifics, but somehow they plan to make money. <br><br>  "one.  Ability to post on blogs, forums, social.  networks, a web player or links to a web player with content in MKV and AVI. ‚Äù <br>  ‚Äú3.  No need for <b>additional installation</b> and configuration of codecs and decoders for high-quality video viewing.  ‚Äû <br><br>  Maybe, of course, but you need to download and install two plug-ins and one of them is <b>32 MB</b> (when uTorrent is less than 1 MB) ... <br><br>  In addition, everything is dull - <a href="http://torrentstream.net/">torrentstream.net</a> , <a href="http://torrentstream.org/">torrentstream.org</a> ?? .. Some unfinished sites and everyone is talking about some kind of monetization ... <br><br>  ‚ÄúTorrent Stream advertising platforms are a high level of quality and reliability that surpasses most eminent resources, where <b>content is infringed from time to time, which absolutely cannot happen on Torrent Stream platforms,</b> taking into account a radically different approach to creating them.‚Äù With <a href="http://torrentstream.net/info.php%3Fid%3D5">torrentstream.net/info. php? id = 5</a> <br><br>  Khmm ... With this I would argue: <a href="http://torrentstream.net/play.php%3Fid%3Dd02f1aed21fb1cd3625a5392d4c1317f98ca4da9">torrentstream.net/play.php?id=d02f1aed21fb1cd3625a5392d4c1317f98ca4da9</a> (Lost, latest episode, link on torrentstream.net) ... <br><br><img src="http://yoihj.ru/habr/screen2.jpg" align="right"><h4>  Interest sake: inside </h4><br>  The player itself is written in Python, built in <a href="http://www.py2exe.org/">py2exe</a> , uses <a href="http://wiki.videolan.org/Libvlc">libvlc</a> , wxWidgets, Tribler.  Source codes do not extend. <br><br>  Tribler also showed up inside library.zip - it seems the BitTorrent client itself provides it.  More precisely, a certain Next Share library from Tribler - to which there was no description in the internet of what it is and what it does, with the exception of the <a href="http://svn.tribler.org/abc/branches/mainbranch/Tribler/ns-LICENSE.txt">beginning of the license file</a> .  The library itself is licensed under the LGPL, so it can be taken on board.  (Tribler himself was under the GPL). <br><br><img src="http://yoihj.ru/habr/screen3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Who will make the Chrome Extension? </h4><br>  Essentially what is needed - the user clicks the right on the .torrent file - it is downloaded, uploaded to torrentstream.org in ‚ÄúUpload torrent-file:‚Äù, the link is returned, which opens in Chrome.  In theory, no difficulties.  Maybe someone will write - write in the comments. <br><br>  PS Karma for the find out of gratitude can raise Comrade.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/amon/" class="user_link">AmoN</a> (player found by <a href="http://amon.habrahabr.ru/blog/87501/">its topic link</a> ) <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> : I invited one of the TorrentStream authors to Habr on a tip from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/amon/" class="user_link">AmoN</a> - meet <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/tstream/" class="user_link">TStream</a> and this is what it <a href="http://amon.habrahabr.ru/blog/87501/">adds</a> : <br><blockquote>  I greet all people in Habr√© and first of all I want to thank AmoN, for responding to my request and creating this post.
