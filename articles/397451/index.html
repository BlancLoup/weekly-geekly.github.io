  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Moto Z Play - the first look at the modular smartphone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Moto Z Play smartphone was officially presented at the IFA 2016 exhibition. Of course, some of its characteristics were known even before the exhibition, but it was as close as possible to look at it only at the Lenovo stand.  If they were asked to formulate the definition of this smartphone in three words, it would have been like this: special, reliable, unique.  The only one, of course, of its kind.  We could not recall a single similar device, not counting the older models of the same line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f87/233/202/f872332026b8b709b0d9f6c49213eea1.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Appearance</font> </h2><br>  The smartphone has received two versions, which differ only in the color of the case.  Black with silver and white with gold - very succinctly.  As they say, you can choose the bright side, and you can - the dark.  In addition to color, no differences are observed anymore.  The back panel of the smartphone is glass, on top of it there is a large protruding camera.  Bottom - contacts to work with additional modules Moto Mods.  Despite the fact that the smartphone is logically attributed to the middle class, he received the maximum similarity with the flagship line of Moto Z and Moto Z Force. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/033/22e/6b8/03322e6b8d2fee36c2d3e9420068f09f.jpg">

Bottom - a fingerprint scanner, made in the form of a speaker on the perimeter of the square and a microphone.  This is not a physical button, the scanner is simply tactilely highlighted.  In any place and in any situation, the finger falls into the scanner - to miss is simply unrealistic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/427/a86/9e4/427a869e44b9e8f8b759f5ac69d8c849.jpg"><br><br>  At the top there is a tray for SIM-cards in nano format.  It is not combined - there is no need to choose between the second SIM and memory expansion via microSD cards.  On the right side - the volume buttons and on / off button.  The latter has a relief notch, which makes it easy to find it, even in your pocket, by touch.  The 3.5 mm headphone jack is located on the bottom, on the left. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Filling</font> </h2><br>  The main difference between a smartphone and its senior counterparts is the battery capacity.  3150 mAh, but the smartphone is able to work up to 50 hours autonomously.  The reinforced battery affected the thickness of the case, it is 6.99 mm, but this does not spoil the impression of Z Play at all - it is perfectly assembled and harmonious. <br><br>  The smartphone received a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display with Full HD resolution, protected by Corning Gorilla Glass.  On board - 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of main memory, plus the possibility of expanding memory through microSD cards (up to 2 TB).  All this wealth is ruled by the eight-core Qualcomm Snapgragon 625 chipset. The graphics chip is Adreno 530. <br><br>  Wireless modules - a complete set: Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n 2.4 / 5 GHz, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, support for 4G LTE networks and even NFC.  The smartphone is able to work with GPS and GLONASS navigation systems. <br><br>  In addition, Moto Z Play has nice add-ons ‚Äî a fast-charging feature that allows you to get another 9 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes at the outlet.  In the presence and water-repellent coating - the smartphone is not afraid of splashing, rain, spilled liquids. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Cameras</font> </h2><br>  Cameras at Moto Z Play are traditionally two.  Primary with a resolution of 16 megapixels, dual autofocus and flash.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to fully evaluate its capabilities within the framework of the exhibition booth, but what it showed in the conditions of artificial lighting can be called a good result. <br><br>  The front camera with a resolution of 5 megapixels and flash can make high-quality selfies.  Using the photo as an example, pay attention to the hair color: a little mobile camera had previously been able to grab a real purple hue. <br><table><tbody><tr><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e04/c34/3fa/e04c343fafdaa95b4c704f8e891690a9.png"></td><td><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c6/640/c1b/7c6640c1b8438fd61bbc0f27149008b7.jpg"></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Moto mods</font> </h2><br>  Talking about any smartphone from the Moto Z line cannot be considered complete without mentioning additional Moto Mods modules.  Mods are mounted on the back of the smartphone, they are actually magnetized, sitting on the phone tightly.  They perform a variety of functionality and start working immediately, immediately after joining. <br><br>  Module Hasselblad True Zoom, developed in conjunction with the Swedish company Hasselblad, can rightly be considered the main among the modules.  It turns any Moto Z into a real camera.  10x optical zoom, the ability to shoot in RAW, a separate shutter button - it all becomes available.  And its appearance is just perfect. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fcb/d1d/090/fcbd1d0905c469c92cc3fdbc8e2fb1d2.jpg"><br><br>  The module Insta-Share Projector is able to display the image from the smartphone screen on any flat surface.  On the nearest light wall you will be able to spread an image up to 70 inches in size with a brightness of 50 lumens.  In addition, the module has its own small battery, which is able to add another hour of screen time to the smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/243/87f/9ef/24387f9ef6160d5e5bbf0deeeca350cb.jpg"><br><br>  The name of the module JBL Sound Boost speaks for itself.  Yes, these are the very speakers that are mounted on a smartphone and ignite your party with a great sound.  The battery of the module will allow you to listen to music for about 10 hours, without using a smartphone battery.  By the way, talking on the speakerphone via the module is also possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ed/e29/d01/0ede29d01bc686b5eba41061c633c533.png"><br><br>  Compact wireless charger, or even a power bank in the Incipio offGRID Power Pack module.  With this module, you get 22 hours of smartphone operation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ece/354/af3/ece354af39885b121b1d6e4742926c8e.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Impressions</font> </h2><br>  First of all, the smartphone gives the impression of a bright and stylish.  The display device is very high quality, lively and deep.  Nice to watch, no less pleasant to touch.  Excellent build, unusual materials make it one of a kind.  Design is an absolutely unique development, there are no similar devices in the world.  Especially pleased that Moto is not limited to the flagships, and released a strong mid-level smartphone with all the available buns. <br><br>  You can argue for a long time on the subject of a serving camera or the lack of a physical Home button, but nowadays everyone has a choice.  If you like the smartphone - it is a long time and maybe forever.  (Hello to Moto fans!) If not, nobody canceled the abundance of choice. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Specifications</font> </h2><br><blockquote>  <b>Processor:</b> eight cores up to 2 GHz, with graphics <br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 3 GB <br>  <b>Built-in memory:</b> 32 GB <br>  <b>Memory card support:</b> microSD up to 2 TB <br>  <b>Display:</b> 5.5 inches, Super AMOLED, Full HD (1920x1080), 403 ppi, Corning Gorilla Glass <br>  <b>Camera:</b> rear - 16 megapixel (Dual AF, flash), front - 5 megapixel (flash) <br>  <b>Communication:</b> Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n 2.4 / 5 GHz, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, 4G LTE, NFC <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS and GLONASS <br>  <b>Sound:</b> speaker on the front side <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 3510 mAh, up to 50 hours of battery life <br>  <b>SIM Cards:</b> Nano-SIM <br>  <b>Colors:</b> black with gray frames and white with gold frames <br>  <b>Dimensions (LxWxH):</b> 156.4x76.4x6.99 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 165 g </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397451/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397451/</a></p>
