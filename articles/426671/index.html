A statement regarding the new project of the company was made by Google CEO Sundar Pichai.  He said that the corporation is trying to establish long-term relations with this country. <br><br>  The project itself was named Project Dragonfly, for the first time it became known about it in August, after The Intercept online resource published information about a certain search service from Google with censorship.  By the way, employees of the company tried to protest, but it seems they didn‚Äôt succeed - the corporation continues to work on Project Dragonfly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Google did not officially confirm or deny the existence of such a project until Kate Enright, one of the company's top managers, spoke to the US Senate explaining the goals and objectives of Project Dragonfly.  But even the senators did not receive detailed information, so it remained only to guess what kind of product it was.

      It should be noted that long before The Intercept revealed the company's plans, it began to try to re-enter the market of the Middle Kingdom, for example, by downloading its applications to third-party catalogs popular among Chinese.  Google Play is not available in this country.  In addition, Google has collaborated and collaborates with partners like Xiaomi and Huawei to popularize their ARCore technology as the basis of augmented and virtual realities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/841/670/345/8416703459cfd02805d259d4c770d4d5.jpg" width="350" align="left">  Pichai said his company has not yet decided whether Project Dragonfly will be launched in China.  If so, this will be the largest competitor to the Chinese search service Baidu.  The head of the corporation also added that now is the time to study the technological capabilities of China from the inside, not from the outside.  ‚ÄúThis is a wonderful, innovative market.  We want to understand what we can do in China, so we started from the inside, ‚Äùsaid Pichai.  He added that ‚Äútaking into account how important the market is and how many users in China, we simply cannot help thinking about it, not trying to look into the future.‚Äù <br><br>  The head of Google said that despite the strict requirements of the Chinese government, the new search service will be able to provide information to users on 99% of the queries they sent.  Pichai believes that Google in many areas is better than local search services, the American search engine will be able to provide more complete and relevant data than Chinese Baidu or other systems. <br><br>  Previously, Google had already worked in the Chinese market, it was in 2010.  Then the service was available at Google.cn.  But after the company refused to comply with the requirements of the Chinese government for filtering search results, she had to leave this country.  A little later, the leadership of the corporation accused the government of the Middle Kingdom in carrying out cyber attacks on a large number of human rights activists.  According to the creators of Google, China violates the fundamental human right - the right to freedom of speech.  This opinion was voiced in the same 2010, when China began to block Googe Docs, Blogger, Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. <br><br>  Whatever anyone may say, but Google has clearly rethought its goals, objectives and values, in any case, those that were relevant nine years ago.  Now Pichai said that a working search service is the realization of the company's mission - to provide information to everyone.  At the same time, he asked not to forget that 20% of the global population lives in China. <br><br>  Sundar Pichai said that many do not understand this, but companies have to balance between the values ‚Äã‚Äãthey themselves declared and the laws of each country in which these companies operate. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the corporation still did not renounce all the declared values.  So, despite the attractiveness of the Pentagon‚Äôs billion-dollar contract, the company <a href="https://habr.com/post/425929/">chose</a> to refuse to participate in it.  Perhaps this was done under pressure from employees who strongly opposed this project, but nevertheless, here the principles overpowered the desire to earn more money.  Previously, Google management has repeatedly stated that it will not participate in projects that are related to the use of artificial intelligence for military purposes.  And indeed, the company decided not to take part in Project Maven - after all, the goal of this project is to develop a system for recognizing people and objects in pictures of UAVs using UAVs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426671/</a></p>
