  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How the crisis affected Yandex.Direct</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the conference ‚Äú <a href="http://optimization.ru/">Search Engine Optimization and Website Promotion on the Internet,</a> ‚Äù which takes place on November 11-12 at the Moscow Hotel Cosmos, head of the Yandex Advertising Technologies Department, Yevgeny Lomize, spoke about how the impending crisis affected the company's advertising network now and what will happen to it soon. <br><br>  According to Eugene, the average price per click in the system over the past two months has fallen by almost 10%.  In addition, problems began to arise with the transfer of payments from customers from the regions - their banks are unstable.  On this, however, the negative in his story ends. <br><br>  Despite the fall in the average click rate, the <b>number of</b> clicks purchased was not only not reduced, but continued to grow at the same rate as a year ago, Lomize says.  And the amount of money in the client account of Yandex.Direct users still exceeds their current needs, leaving a little ‚Äúin reserve‚Äù (which, in general, according to the ideology of contextual advertising, always looks like waste).

      These encouraging trends have allowed Lomize to continue his story in the light of ‚Äúthe crisis will heal the industry and provide new opportunities for a breakthrough,‚Äù which has already become customary for public speaking by our employees.  Eugene outlined several advantages of the context over other types of advertising, as well, just sent by a higher power to the aid of tightening belts to marketing specialists. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is, above all, the rapid turnover of funds in context-sensitive (as the professionals like to call it) advertising.  For an advertising campaign in Yandex.Direct, Runner or AdSense, you do not need to reserve money for creative development, shooting commercials, booking places on pages of magazines and newspapers.  Today we have invested - today and tomorrow we got the result. <br><br>  Such a property, as Eugene noted, makes it possible not to even consider advertising expenses in the context of advertising expenses - it is easier to carry them out as transaction costs.  Therefore, it should be much easier to beat the money out of bosses and customers. <br><br>  In the same regions, which are still practically not covered by contextual advertising, because of the crisis, it can finally force out old-fashioned banners, Lomize said.  And in the markets of both capitals, Yevgeny immediately predicts, the competitive struggle for the client will begin.  Which, as you know, on the hand of the consumer. <br><br>  Improved campaign management tools and interface convenience for various levels of detail settings.  Customer service will be gentle and caring, and detailed recommendations for optimizing ROI will fall on advertisers' heads like a horn of plenty.  And there will catch up and high-quality advertising platforms - juicy sites that will feel the shortage of expensive mediyki and will look for other ways to monetize. <br><br>  Having summed up all this with the mantra ‚Äúthe market will begin to shrink only if the crisis proves to be protracted‚Äù (a <i>quiet concomitant tapping on the wooden surfaces in the hall</i> ), Lomize finished off the listeners with one more touching detail.  Overdrafts - the opportunity to twist advertising in Yandex.Direct for a couple of weeks - from the end of the summer they began to give even more accurate, so Yandex will continue to trust its partners with experience (more than six months of a stable budget).  Well, aren't they cute? <br><br>  But the listener from the audience who asked the question about why the Directive (and in general) never got accustomed to the mechanism of payment for action (Cost Per Action, CPA), Eugene was besieged.  So it will be difficult to consider, and as a result to context systems it is completely not profitable.  Therefore, it will not be anywhere, he said. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44371/</a></p>
