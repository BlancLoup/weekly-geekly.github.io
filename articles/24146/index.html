  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About the first dollar earned on the Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to talk about how and when I earned my first pretty penny on the net.  No, it will not be another post on the topic ‚ÄúHow I earned 3 bucks a month instead of the usual two by simply outweighing the adsense in the upper left corner of the blog and successfully selecting the colors‚Äù :) <br><br>  It was the case in early 2005.  Already then I was actively interested in handmade and climbed on the bourgeois Internet in search of inspiration and like-minded people.  I do not remember how, but I came across the site <a href="http://bead-patterns.com/" rel="nofollow">http://bead-patterns.com/</a> .  They sell pdf files that contain instructions on how to make this or that piece of jewelry.  Having done so much in a search engine and got stuck with graphic programs, a dictionary and a camera, I created the first PDF file in my life with the scheme and description of my bracelet making, and sent a request to the website: they say, I want to sell my schemes from you.  Then I drew a few more schemes, and uploaded to their site.  Climbing on the schemes of other designers, I was just shocked by the prices that they put on their pdf files: from 4 to 7 bucks for a scheme in which, without looking inside, it is clear how it is done.  I set prices according to general trends, and was overjoyed when, the next day, going into the statistics, I saw that one of my schemes, which I valued at 5 bucks, bought: 2 dollars went to the site owners, 3 got to me .  For a month from the sale of 5 pdf files, $ 90 has come over.  It was a whole wealth for me, an unprecedented amount, and it seemed to me that I received them for free, without much effort: I did it once, and then sit and reap the fruits of effort all my life.  After 2 months, sales began to fall, because my schemes left the category of new ones.  I had to draw something else, so that people who were browsing the new products noticed me and started buying again, at the same time looking at the rest of the poi schemes and buying something from the old one.  Then there was a mini-revolution in my mind.  I could never have thought that someone would pay that kind of money for the opportunity to print my pdf file once. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      In addition to posting on this site at the beginning of 2005, I sent 5 of my schemes to the bourgeois paid Internet magazine, stumbled upon their announcement ‚ÄúWe are looking for designers‚Äù.  They bought the right to publish 50 bucks for each scheme.  I will never forget how I jumped when I received a check for $ 250: I then studied at the third course, I did not have normal work and my parents did not indulge in pocket money.  It was a fortune that I spent on snowboard boots, which seemed to me an unattainable dream until that moment :) <br><br>  All bourgeois offices offer to transfer you money to the paper-account, or send a personal check.  Since we, Rusichs, were not particularly favored by the paper, they sent me personal checks, which I cashed out (or, to put it in the right way, I ‚Äúleased for collection‚Äù at the Bank of Moscow, where at that moment there was the least brutal interest for this service. With each check 300 rubles went to the bank as a commission, regardless of the amount of the check. Once I got a call from the currency control and asked where the money came from and why. I honestly told me, they didn‚Äôt call me anymore, but for some reason some unpleasant aftertaste I stayed :) <br><br>  Then I stopped adding new schemes, because I was tired of it and because I found a normal job and this money no longer seemed so big.  Then I resurrected my website, and I directed all my efforts to filling it with unique content.  Now on the table for several months now there is a check for $ 400, which I can‚Äôt take to the bank in any way - that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been in for 1.5 years (I asked to send everything with one check in order to save money on the bank‚Äôs commission). <br><br>  I am more than confident that not only in the field of handmade can you earn a little extra money.  Any specialized periodicals always need new material, so you can nati something more profitable than Adsense - provided that you at least know something other than writing posts in the style of "10 ways to make money on the Web."  Well, knowledge of English, of course, is welcome :) <br><br>  And about the profits from Adsense, I demolished him nafig, because you can‚Äôt look at those pennies he brings without tears.  In my category, CPC is just a mockery.  It seems to me that by the time he brings $ 100, it will be at least a year.  Although, I really liked the idea that I stumbled upon while searching for a topic for my Wordpress blog.  Some guys who draw free themes for WordPress, embed their AdSense code into the theme, and already with it hang out free themes on the sites.  Not only that a lot of people browse these sites daily, and surely someone clicks on their adsense.  There are still a lot of people who post topics without editing them, because they honor the work of the author, or because they do not know how to edit, or because they don‚Äôt care.  That is, someone chose your skin for his blog, he writes everything, tries - and you get money for clicks.  In my opinion, they came up very nicely.  If I were not lazy, I would try to do that too :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24146/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24146/</a></p>
