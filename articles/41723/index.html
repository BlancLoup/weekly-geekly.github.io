How do people mix beer and sport, and why do Americans punch cans of beer with keys?  What is common in a powerful press with beer, and much more - in this issue about beer in America. <br><br>  Beer is the national drink in America, according to <a href="http://www.beersoaksamerica.org/consumption.htm">some sources,</a> up to 85% of all alcoholic beverages consumed in America is beer.  Beer is sold in boxes of 6, 12, 18 and 30 in cardboard boxes.  They call it all (packs), they say - let's go buy 6 packs?  By the way, 6 packs are also translated as a powerful press ("6 cubes on the belly"). <br><br>  <b>American brands:</b>

      There are four brands among popular brands: <br><br>  1. Budweiser - 51% of the market. <br>  2. Miller - 19% of the market <br>  3. Coors - 11% of the market <br>  4. Samuel Adams - the most popular American beer outside of the States.  It has ‚Äúwinter‚Äù, ‚Äúautumn‚Äù, ‚Äúspring‚Äù and other beers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>A bit of history</b> <br><br>  The reason why American beer did not become as widespread in the world as Dutch, German or Mexican is banal.  BBB  American beer was popular in the world and had a rich history.  But the fact is that American breweries were based on German recipes and specialists, who had to be deported during World War II, and the factories were dismantled. <br><br>  From the beginning of the 50s, American beer began to be reborn in small home breweries, while European traditional brands were already generously exported abroad. <br><br>  <b>Beer prices:</b> <br><br>  Prices for a can of beer are almost the same: $ 1-1.5 per can, 60-75 cents if bought with a box, $ 3-5 in a bar.  Beer is sold only in specialized stores, that is, no supermarkets and stalls.  By the way, in some you can find our marks like Baltic :) <br><br>  <b>Students and beer:</b> <br><br>  Student parties (parties) begin on Thursday evening.  For the most part, students buy beer in boxes and invite all friends and acquaintances.  If you are familiar with the party owner, admission is free.  If not, then 4 bucks at the entrance and drink as much as fit.  Since for the most part cheap Natural beer is offered (30 cents per can), the owner will definitely discourage his grandmother :) <br><br>  On the other hand, you can get drunk for 4 dollars and hang out, than lowering the same attendants at the bar for one can.  By the way, girls adore when a guy pays a bar for them.  Although the feeling that in feminist America do not so often :) <br><br>  Also, plus home parties is that the company will surely be those who are less than the 21st.  But the bar is not allowed, but at parties no one will ask :) Although the youngsters for the most part have a ‚Äúfake id‚Äù - fake driver's license. <br><br>  <b>Features of drinking beer:</b> <br><br>  It was here that I learned to drink beer with crispy corn chips, dipping them into Mexican sauce.  Wow  It is cooler than with squid and fish! <br><br>  Everyone knows the American speed eating hamburgers.  So, they also drink beer for speed.  Punch a jar with a key on the side, and while it sprinkles drink up to a drop.  I did not immediately succeed. <br><br>  Since America loves sports, especially American football, there is such a thing as Tailgating.  This is a public plump in broad daylight, in the parking lot near the stadium before the start of the game.  Soon we have matches, so I'll try to make a video.  This is a must see with your own eyes!  Beer by the way is poured into the funnel, and through the hose is drunk under the approving roar of friends.  Especially faithful ‚Äúfriends‚Äù can kindly take a photo and post it on Facebook.  To the joy of future employers.  Hehe. <br><br>  <b>Sport and beer:</b> <br><br>  Also in America there is a purely national sport - Beer Pong.  From the word Ping Pong, just a beer :) <br><br>  They play two pairs on each side of the table.  At the edges of the table are placed plastic glasses, half filled with beer, in the form of a triangle in billiards.  The rivals take turns throwing the ping-pong ball into the opponent's glasses.  If clogged, the beer is drunk by the losing side and the glass is removed.  It may seem that the losers drink more alcohol, so what's the point to win?  But the fact is that the winners still drink their glasses at the end of the game.  And they remain to play with the following applicants!  :) <br><br>  Beer Pong is played mostly by students, but there is a championship at the national level. <br><br>  By the way, I should note that American beer is weaker than Russian.  Therefore, they drink boxes!  :) <br><br>  Was your American columnist with you, <br>  Romero. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41723/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41723/</a></p>
