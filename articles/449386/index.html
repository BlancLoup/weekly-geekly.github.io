  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet for summer resident. We get the maximum speed in 4G networks. Part 1. Choosing the right router.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few years ago, I already conducted a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261431/">survey of communications for a summer resident</a> or living in his house, where broadband access is not available or costs such money that it is easier to move to the city.  Since then, a lot of terabytes have been transmitted and it became interesting to me, and what is now on the market for good access to the network via LTE or 4G.  So, I have collected some old and new routers with the ability to work through cellular networks and compared the speed of work and their functions.  For the results I ask for cat.  By tradition, if anyone is too lazy to read, you can watch the video. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I1wCmQhKmX8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the fact that I did not set myself the task of finding out which of the cellular operators provides the best speed, but decided to find out which of the modems / routers provides a higher speed under the same conditions.  Beeline was chosen as the provider.  The following operators are available in my region: Beeline, MTS, Megafon, Tele2, Yota, WiFire.  ‚ÄúStriped‚Äù was chosen only because I already had his sim card.  I don‚Äôt give preference to any of the providers - each of them just makes money. <br><br><h3>  Testing method </h3><br>  To the base station, in a straight line, about 8 km, if you believe the router.  All tests were conducted on weekdays from 11 to 13, since at that time the least load on 4G networks.  Fundamentally, I do not consider the 3G network test, since they also carry the voice communication load, and only data is transferred via 4G.  Warning conversations about VoLTE I will say that at the testing site the voice via LTE is not yet launched.  The test was carried out three times using the Speedtest service, the data were entered into a table and the average value of the download speed, data transfer and ping was calculated.  Attention was also paid to the capabilities of the router.  Test conditions: clear weather, no precipitation.  Foliage in the trees there.  The height of the equipment is 10 meters above the ground.

      Tests for all devices were carried out separately for the "bare" router, in the factory configuration.  The second test was conducted when connecting to a small directional antenna, if the device has the appropriate connectors.  The third test was carried out with a connection to a large panel antenna. <br><br>  In the last column, I added the final cost of the solution: for example, a router + modem + antenna can receive better than just a router, but cost less.  Color gradation is introduced to visually identify one or another basic device to which an additional antenna can be connected. <br><br>  I will give a scan of the radio to understand the conditions of signal reception and the presence of BS in the radius of the router. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y1/o7/fh/y1o7fhbx5mdivuticmvinknhsqk.jpeg"><br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.ulmart.ru/goods/4385490">LTE MiMo INDOOR</a> Small Antenna</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7c/96/qa/7c96qaxow4fc7u5wajdadmx5lbe.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>TTH:</b> <br><br>  Antenna design: Indoor <br>  Antenna type: wave channel <br>  Supported communication standards: LTE, HSPA, HSPA + <br>  Operating frequencies, MHz: 790-2700 <br>  Gain, max.

Works on 2G / 3G / 4G networks.  It has connectors for connecting an external antenna.  Equipped with a built-in battery, which lasts for a couple of hours of very dense work in the network or hours for 5 unhurried surfing.  There is a place to install a microSD card, which is available when accessing via a local wireless network.  The cost is not too high, and when connected to a small and even large antenna through various pigtails and cable assemblies, it gives a very decent result, taking fourth place in the speed rating.  The router is very convenient when traveling and traveling by car, since it takes up little space, but provides the Internet for everyone in a small radius of action.  This also results in minuses: the range of the router is not very large - the whole area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe dacha will not cover.  There are no Ethernet ports, which means that wired IP cameras and other network equipment that wants to connect to the network via cable cannot be connected.  It supports only Wi-Fi 2.4 GHz, so in places with a large number of networks, the speed may even be limited.  In general, an excellent mobile router for work "in the fields." <br><br>  <b>+</b> good battery life, support for all types of cellular networks, high data transfer rate when connecting external antennas <br><br>  <b>- the</b> inability to connect wired technology <br><br><h4>  <b>Keenetic Viva + MF823 Modem</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fz/8y/cu/fz8ycu5s-6vy_2k29dgvyeq2adi.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>TTF MF823:</b> <br><br>  Network support: 2G, 3G, 4G <br>  Protocol support: LTE-FDD: 800/900/1800 / 2600MHz;  UMTS: 900 / 2100MHz; <br>  EGPRS / GSM: 850/900/1800 / 1900MHz;  LTE-FDD: DL / UL 100 / 50Mbps (Category3) <br><br>  The only router in this test that does not itself work with cellular networks, but it has two USB ports and support almost all USB modems that work with cellular networks.  Moreover, you can connect a smartphone on Android or iOS to USB and the router will use them as a modem.  In addition, Keenetic Viva can use any Wi-Fi source as a source of access to the Internet, be it the Internet of its neighbors, a public access point or shared Internet from a smartphone.  But at home, this router connects to the network via a normal Ethernet cable and allows you to work in networks with speeds up to 1 Gigabit per second.  That is a universal combine that can be used both at home and in the country.  Plus, you can connect an external drive to the free USB port (there are two of them) and the router will start downloading torrents itself or act as a local server for storing video from video surveillance cameras.  As for working with 4G networks via a modem, this bundle took the second place in the test, although this required connecting a large external antenna.  But even without it, for only 9 thousand rubles, you can get an excellent router with a large number of functions and stable Internet access.  It's nice that the 4G modem can be used as a backup channel: when the wired provider ‚Äúcrashes‚Äù, the router will switch to work from the USB modem.  And if the modem hangs, the router will reboot it for power.  A wonderful combine, and only. <br><br>  <b>+</b> An excellent bundle of the router and modem will provide the Internet, both in the apartment and in the country.  Works with almost all modems.  Great functionality <br><br>  <b>-</b> Without a modem does not work with cellular networks <br><br><h4>  <b>TP-Link Archer MR200 v1</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hx/gg/sn/hxggsnozphvnjwgi9layeubvfyw.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>TTX:</b> <br><br>  Network support: 3G, 4G <br>  Supported protocols: 4G: FDD-LTE B1 / B3 / B7 / B8 / B20 (2100/1800/2600/900 / 800MHz) <br>  TDD-LTE B38 / B39 / B40 / B41 (2600/1900/2300 / 2500MHz) <br>  3G: DC-HSPA + / HSPA + / HSPA / UMTS B1 / B8 (2100 / 900MHz) <br><br>  This router exists in three modifications - v1, v2 and v3.  The principal difference is that the v1 version has external antennas for 3G / 4G networks, and Wi-Fi antennas have built-in ones.  Other versions have the opposite.  That is, an external antenna can be connected to the first modification, and the second and third can no longer be connected.  It should be noted that the router has good base antennas with good gain.  The functionality of the firmware is also quite rich, although it is inferior to the model from Keenetic.  Standard SMA connectors are ready for connecting an external antenna, which made it possible to increase the speed in my case by a factor of three.  But there are drawbacks to the router: judging by the forums, TP-Link's technical support is extremely weak, firmwares are rarely released, and there were a lot of defects / glitches in the first modification, which is so valuable to the ‚Äúsummer residents‚Äù.  In my case, the router has been working without problems for several years.  I traveled with many cities, worked in the fields, eating from an inverter in a car, providing the whole company with the Internet.  Decent router, if you find the first modification. <br><br>  <b>+</b> Communication over the cellular network with external antennas (v1), which can be replaced by improving reception.  Simple and functional device. <br><br>  <b>-</b> A lot of complaints about the glitches and the marriage of the desired modification of the router. <br><br><h4>  <b>Zyxel Keenetic LTE</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2x/hm/ot/2xhmotngsjasl_b4vivgadrvdyu.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>TTX:</b> <br><br>  Network support: 4G <br>  Protocol support: 791‚Äì862 MHz (Band 20, FDD), 1800 MHz (Band 3, FDD), 2500‚Äì2690 MHz (Band 7, FDD) <br><br>  Old, but not lost its relevance model from Zyxel.  The router is very rich in functionality: sensitive LTE-antennas, SMA-connectors for connecting external antennas, two ports for connecting analog telephone sets, 5 Ethernet ports, USB-port.  In fact, this router is a whole combine, which the Internet will provide and the phone will connect, since there is a built-in SIP client.  In addition, the LTE module can serve as a backup Internet connection if the main, wired channel stops working.  That is, the router can work both at home (in the office) and in the country.  The USB port can be used to connect an external drive or printer.  As shown by the speed tests, it is only slightly inferior in downloading the TP-Link Archer MR200, while in the price it is a third lower.  The model is out of sales, but it is easy to find in the secondary market.  There are only a few drawbacks: it works only on 4G networks and does not receive firmware updates.  The second is not so important, since the current firmware is quite stable and functional, but the work only on 4G networks suits me completely - it is in these networks that cellular companies operate that provide unlimited Internet. <br><br>  <b>+ The</b> router rich in functions, allows to connect the external antenna, it is possible to connect the telephone set <br><br>  <b>-</b> Works only on LTE networks, firmware is not updated. <br><br><h4>  <b>Zyxel LTE3316-M604</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pe/x8/9f/pex89fdjopjgk2n2r4oeqflovzm.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>TTX:</b> <br><br>  Network support: 3G, 4G <br>  Protocol support: HSPA + / UMTS 2100/1800/900/850 MHz (Band 1/3/5/8), WCDMA: 2100/1800/900/850 MHz, LTE FDD 2600/2100/1800/900/850/800 / 700 MHz, LTE TDD 2600/2500/2300 MHz <br><br>  Very interesting router, which is a logical continuation of Zyxel Keenetic LTE, but with a modified filling and design.  The stylish little white device still has a pair of outputs for connecting an external antenna, thereby demonstrating support for MIMO technology.  This is all the more interesting, because the router supports data transmission in both 3G and 4G networks.  But it differs from the old model by the absence of a USB port and only one FXS connector, that is, you can connect only one analog telephone.  By the way, this model does not have a built-in SIP client and calls will be made through the installed SIM card.  If the network supports VoLTE, then you can continue to work with the network and communicate at the same time, otherwise, the router will switch to 3G and Internet access may be interrupted.  Again, when compared with the previous model, the information content of the menu has become worse, but the speed indicators in the LTE network cause delight!  The previous model Zyxel LTE3316-M604 overtakes almost one and a half times when connecting an external antenna, and when working with a built-in.  Able to work with two Internet providers (by wire and LTE) and switch when the main channel falls on the backup one.  In general, a highly specialized router, but with a decent modem! <br><br>  <b>+</b> Excellent speed performance, the ability to connect an analog telephone for calls via sim-card <br><br>  <b>-</b> Not very informative menu, lack of SIP-client <br><br><h4>  <b>Zyxel LTE7460-M608</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oc/pl/cw/ocplcwnqc2zffmaemogoctfwci4.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>TTH:</b> <br><br>  Network support: 2G, 3G, 4G <br>  Supported protocols: GPRS, EDGE, HSPA +, HSUPA, LTE TDD 2300/2600 MHz, LTE FDD 2600/2100/1800/900/800 MHz <br><br>  Evolution of the legendary Zyxel LTE 6101 router as a single unit - Zyxel LTE7460-M608.  In this model, everything is very interesting: the antenna itself, the 2G / 3G / 4G modem and the router are hidden in an airtight unit and assume installation outside without fear of any weather conditions.  That is, even in our latitudes, such a device will survive both a hot summer and a fierce winter.  There is a younger model, LTE7240-M403, but it is guaranteed to work only up to -20 degrees, when the Zyxel LTE7460-M608 can withstand temperatures down to -40.  In general, this device is perfect for those who do not want to bother with external antennas, cable assemblies, pulling additional wires and other things.  The antenna is hung in the direction of the base station with the aid of a complete bracket, only one Ethernet cable is fed through which power is also supplied (the PoE injector is located at any convenient place in the room), and then the user receives an Ethernet cable with access to the world wide web.  Here is the truth for a comfortable job you need to install a wireless access point or any router to organize your home wired and wireless network.  As for the speed characteristics, this router made all the other models, until ... until a large panel antenna was connected to the other devices.  Still, 2 built-in antennas with a gain of up to 8 dBi are inferior to a large panel antenna with a gain of up to 16 dBi.  But as a ready-made solution for installation and operation, it can be recommended. <br><br>  <b>+</b> Work in 2G / 3G / 4G networks, excellent reception, work in all weather conditions, laying of only one cable to the installation site. <br><br>  <b>-</b> You will need a separate Wi-Fi router for organizing a wired and wireless network at home. <br><br><h3>  results </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1t/lt/mj/1tltmj2t6jmrykfhjjv_w1py-yo.jpeg"><br><br>  Looking at this histogram, it becomes immediately clear how much the speed of reception and transmission depends on the antenna gain.  In addition, in the first test, without using external antennas, the sensitivity of the own antennas and radio modules of the modems is obvious.  The use of a directional panel antenna has increased the connection speed three times - is this not the result when you want a lot of Internet for a little money?  But do not forget that the acquisition of the router does not guarantee good communication and you need to add an antenna, especially when the communication tower is not visible to the naked eye.  Sometimes, the cost of the antenna can be equal to the cost of the router and it is worthwhile to think about acquiring a ready-made device, like the Zyxel LTE7460-M608, where the antenna and the router are assembled together.  Moreover, such a solution is not afraid of temperature drops and precipitation.  But you can‚Äôt take out a USB modem or an ordinary router, and in an ordinary attic they will have a hard time - in the summer it will hang due to overheating, and in the winter it will just freeze.  But increasing the length of the cable assembly from the antenna to the receiving device can offset all the benefits of installing a good expensive antenna.  And here is the rule: the closer the radio module is to the antenna, the lower the losses and the higher the speed. <br>  For those who love numbers, I collected the results of all tests in a table, and the last column was the cost of assembly.  I highlighted this or that device with the addition of antennas or without antennas to facilitate visual search of results. <br><br>  Separately, I decided to test the work of the router without an obstacle and with an obstacle in the form of a double glazed window.  That is, simply installing the Zyxel LTE7460-M608 router behind and in front of the window.  The speed of reception fell imperceptibly, but the transfer dropped almost threefold.  If the glass will have any spraying, the results will be even more pitiable.  The conclusion is obvious: there should be as few obstacles as possible between the antenna and the base station. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cf/mn/w_/cfmnw_l3dkdkrh8d_abrisauwi8.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  According to the measurement results, it is obvious that the capabilities of the communication modules built into the routers are significantly different, but even without an additional antenna, this speed is quite enough for watching videos or videoconferencing via Skype.  Nevertheless, it is obvious from the graphs that the use of an antenna can increase the speed several times.  But here it is necessary to observe a balance between the invested funds and the result obtained.  For example: buying a Zyxel LTE3316-M604 and a panel antenna, you can get a result even better than the finished device Zyxel LTE7460-M608.  But then the panel antenna will be almost twice as large, and the router should be placed in close proximity to the antenna - this can cause difficulties. <br><br>  As a result, the winner in the speed test - Zyxel LTE3316-M604 with a large panel antenna.  It is necessary to tinker a bit with the direction of the antenna, and the interface of the router only in English can cause discomfort to someone.  The winner in the test of functionality - Keenetic Viva with 4G modem.  This router can work both in an apartment with a classic Internet, and in the country, where only cellular networks are available from providers.  The winner in the test of ready-made solutions - Zyxel LTE7460-M608.  This all-weather router is good because it can be placed anywhere, it is not afraid of any weather conditions, but to complete the work it will need a Wi-Fi access point, a mesh system or an organized LAN.  For frequent trips and travels by car, the Huawei E5372 mobile router is well suited - it can work both autonomously and being connected to a charger or power bank.  Well, if you want a maximum speed for a minimum of money, then you should look for TP-Link Archer MR200 v1 - it has a good radio module and the ability to connect an external antenna, although there were defective copies. <br><br><h3>  Announcement </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/zy/ad/zazyadcme28uooz_ppvxqto5u7u.jpeg"><br><br>  I was fascinated by the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãachieving maximum speed at a great distance from the base station of the cellular operator, so I decided to take the most powerful router and try it with three types of external antennas: circular, panel, and parabolic.  The results of my experiments - in the next issue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/449386/">https://habr.com/ru/post/449386/</a></p>
