  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Goodbye tv</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Television receives extremely mixed assessments in different sectors of society.  Moreover, these assessments are often directly opposed.  In Russia, the last few years, spontaneously, but quite reasonably, the discussion about television has opened. <br><br>  Politicians, representatives of the film industry, writers, publicists and, of course, the audience take part in it.  However, the question of what is television as a phenomenon of modern life is rarely discussed? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let me express my point of view.  My approach is not impartial, but, on the contrary, motivated.  The author‚Äôs relationship with television is not easy, and in part these lines are an open attempt to understand the current situation in the world of TV.  In addition, there is a desire to give the discussion of modern television a certain logical and intellectual clarity.  Today, unfortunately, in most cases, these are emotional remarks and accusatory speeches. <br><br>  There is another reason why the conversation about TV is long overdue.  Telemir has penetrated deep into our lives, it is totally present at any point on earth.  TV affects the culture, the style of the print press, the syllable and meaning of literary works, the installation and technique of shooting motion pictures, the living use of the Russian language.  TV influences the behavior and preferences of children, influences the choice of lifestyle, determines which goods and services we buy, affecting the sphere of values ‚Äã‚Äãand preferences.  TV does not oppose culture, it ignores and substitutes culture, turning the latter into a kind of Old Slavonic words.  The words are there, but they are derived from the living conversion.  Therefore, to understand the nature of TV - these two omnipotent letters is very important.

      Television as an industrial technology of broadcasting a moving image over a distance appeared in the late thirties - early forties of the last century.  It was a true revolution - since then the movies have been watched from the comfort of their own home.  After only ten years - in 1953 - color television appears in the USA, which significantly expands the possibilities of using the new technology. <br><br>  From the first days of TV, a dispute arose about whether the cinema and film distribution would stand under the onslaught of new technological opportunities.  Cinematographers naively believed that television would show only films. <br><br>  In fact, the TV stations formed a powerful information broadcasting, seizing the initiative from the radio.  From the very first years of the development of television, it became clear that, as a business, it was developing along the same commercial scheme as radio.  This is a model of infotainment broadcasting, where the main source of funding is commercial advertising. <br>  In the 1950s, television stations broadcast news, conduct political propaganda, and, in addition, broadcast feature films and theatrical productions, which were created by professionals who do not work on TV. <br><br>  TV becomes a nationwide cinema screen.  The advent of television was accepted with tremendous enthusiasm by both artists and society in general in all countries and continents.  However, the development and the very fate of television was decisively influenced not by the support of people, but by the development and formation of large international companies. <br><br>  The emergence of global corporations coincided with the birth of television.  If in the 20 years steelmaking and shipbuilding companies dominated the industrial economy, then it was in the 1950s that firms emerged that produce mass products to meet the daily demands of millions of people. <br><br>  Transnational companies account for 90% of direct investment, 80% of patents and licenses for new equipment, 63% of foreign trade and about 50% of industrial production in the world.  The center of the global economy is 500 corporations that control the most important segments of commodity production and the sphere of financial circulation.  These companies create channels of international exchange, the most important of which are information and high technology.  A pressing problem of their development is the formation of demand for their products among the population.  Traditional advertising channels - the press and radio stations - did not provide the necessary influence on the market, and the gaze of business turned to television stations. <br><br>  The commercial potential of a new mode of influence on society was assessed by them very quickly.  Golden rain hit the television.  Since then, advertising and television are identical concepts.  Many cultural figures in vain offended by TV.  Fairly assessing television products as low-grade, devoid of taste and high meaning, they forget that they are not dealing with a museum or an art gallery, but with a business ‚Äî with an enterprise for making money.  TV stations aim to attract the maximum number of viewers to show them the advertising of goods and services.  For this reason, mass TV attracts the viewer not with high art, but with selectively selected news, criminal news, primitive humor, sports broadcasts and scandalous revelations of stars. <br><br>  In the 60-70s of the last century, in the early stages of the development of this powerful industry, the activities of journalists, reporters and political observers were separated from the work of actors, directors and scriptwriters.  Actually, art, journalism and propaganda coexisted in tandem, but with the preservation of their independent status.  With the growth of influence and coverage, with the advent of color TV, and now numbers, television has become the most powerful tool of political and commercial propaganda of modern civilization.  Against the background of these metamorphoses, the process of ousting art from the television broadcast was completed.  Replaced by properly speaking speakers, speakers, journalists came.  Films and original productions left the air, and their place was filled with a television product or, as they say now, content.  The convergence of technology has provided television stations with the opportunity to create the necessary product for the air themselves, which, in their opinion, attracts the viewer better.  Against this background, there was an unprecedented increase in commercial activity. <br><br>  Today, television reporters independently generate content, where the main characters are the creators themselves - the journalists.  The institute of various talking heads has become a common place on television.  Many of them have acquired the status of media stars and overshadowed the glory of movie actors.  With the arrival of TV presenters in the frame, the viewer has lost the opportunity to form their own opinion.  Today we are attacked by a medium that controls our consciousness from the screen of a television receiver.  He explains what is happening in the frame and how to treat it.  Any halftones, creative delights, refinement and hints disappeared. <br><br>  Politicians use the broadcast to promote ideas and candidates for elected government positions.  It is important to note here that television can play a cruel joke on public figures.  Like any other product, it can destroy the policy, feeding the audience a constant flicker in the frame.  The political leader on TV risks quickly losing the phenomenon of novelty and become a familiar advertising storyline.  And if a product can be replaced with a new model, then it cannot be done with a state person.  Probably for this reason, the wise Kremlin consultants began the nomination of Vladimir Putin, and later of Dmitry Medvedev just a few months before the elections.  These statesmen managed to preserve newness and interest in their personalities.  As the opposite unsuccessful example of political advertising, I propose to consider the situation in Ukraine, where political elites have not changed over the past 15 years.  All of them are ‚Äúgoods‚Äù that are difficult to sell for the hundredth time, even using the full power of the television industry.  This makes the political situation in this country in the light of the upcoming elections, very difficult for the readership, and the consequences are not predictable. <br><br>  In which direction is TV developing?  Of course, it will develop, but development does not imply the inclusion in the orbit of the interests of the large world of classical and modern art and culture in general.  Most likely, in the coming years, the creation of specialized channels for focusing on the viewer will continue.  At the first stage, there will be a lot of such niche projects, but later only traditional directions will remain - news, news, entertainment and laughter, as well as sports.  The rest will be rejected due to the low coverage of the audience.  With the advertising business model, everything that does not fall into these categories will be discarded as ineffective.  The trend will continue: TV will buy less and less for display and will increasingly produce on its own.  Broadcasting companies are transformed into production.  Everything that comes out on television in the coming years will be produced by the television companies themselves.  TV is a part of a big business and, perhaps, the most important part of it.  He has no other tasks than the desire to sell.  TV - this is a shop on the couch where the viewer sells goods, services, stereotypes of social behavior, social values ‚Äã‚Äãand ideals.  Classical feature films, documentaries, popular science films, educational and author cinema will leave the air due to poor retention of the viewer at the screen. <br><br>  TV is not part of the culture in the usual sense of the word.  TV is part of the modern economy of capitalism.  It is in vain to demand and expect the solution of super tasks from television or the fulfillment of pressing social missions.  This is a business, and it will do what is beneficial to its customers in the face of the ruling political forces and the largest national and international companies.  Culture and television have diametrically opposite goals.  TV stations are motivated by financial results, culture is the preservation and development of civilization values.  Television is aggressive and assertive, culture is metaphysical, reflective and contemplative. <br><br>  The Soviet era is over, and this fact must be recognized and accepted.  Previously, TV was a part of culture, its translator and carrier, but the situation changed radically with the change of historical paradigms.  You should not mix culture, art and cinema with television.  Art and TV today and, apparently, forever - completely different concepts.  No public television can be created, since it is impossible to combine the incompatible.  I propose to leave hope and release the TV in an independent voyage.  Anyone who intends to engage in art in any genre - from cinema to composing poetry, can at best rely on a news story.  No creative evenings and profound interviews - all this is beyond the limits of TV interests.  This article is called "Goodbye TV."  Many people from my environment have forgiven him long ago, have lost interest in him as a translator of knowledge and an information source.  Television finally lost its credibility with a large part of society.  Culture once again offered to find their own way to the people.  This is the challenge of a new era, and it must be accepted.  He turned not only in the direction of artists and intellectuals, but also to the state.  With the final commercialization of TV, the national elite was deprived of the opportunity to conduct a balanced and meaningful dialogue with society; today there is no reliable and permanent instrument for transmitting high, timeless values ‚Äã‚Äãand ideas to people.  Therefore, the need for new initiatives is long overdue, this will be discussed in the next article. <br><br>  The Atlas of Culture project <a href="http://www.atlas-culture.ru/">www.atlas-culture.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81295/</a></p>
