Barriers to entering the franchise market are minimal - any proletarian can open his desk. <br><br>  There is a bunch of free specialists who successfully spud small businesses, and put pressure on the franchisee 1C from below with its price.  Large system integrators are beginning to push down on top of their competence and capabilities.  They have accumulated fat, spudding oil and gas companies, and now they are slowly entering the top segment of the integrated automation market at 1C: Enterprise 8.

      And the most important thing.  All more or less successful client companies are now actively developing their own IT departments and luring the best 1C specialists to their staff.  Given the much higher profitability of their core business, they can offer working conditions incomparable to the French.  As a result, the turnover in a franchisee company can reach hundreds of percent per year !!!  Wildness for other sectors of the economy. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  My conclusion is this.  If the company's business model is below the baseboard, there is no reason to talk about attractive conditions for employees.  No matter how wonderful people are the leaders of a particular franchisee company. <br>  The trouble of the 1C franchisee network is not in individual bad franchisee firms, but in the very principles of 1C franchisee business.  The business model of the franchisee is sharpened on the mass provision of the simplest standardized services in conditions of excess cheap labor. <br>  The term ‚Äúfranchising‚Äù itself is most often used for fast-food chains, dry cleaners, etc.  etc.  This business model was formed in the mid-nineties, when even the seven 1C was a distant prospect, and a salary of $ 300 seemed like a pipe dream.  The main activity of the franchisee, then it was not "programming", but the sale of yellow boxes and the installation of standard updates. <br><br>  Since then much water has flowed.  Oil began to cost $ 130 per barrel, and a square meter of housing in Moscow - $ 5,500.  A catastrophic shortage of skilled labor has formed on the market.  Firm 1C, meanwhile, also did not stand a place.  The capabilities of 1C: Enterprise software products and their complexity have increased exponentially, and today we have 1C: Manufacturing Enterprise Management and 1C: Consolidation. <br><br>  And what about 1C partners?  They both remained a temporary shelter for yesterday's students and losers, and remained.  It is impossible to read the so-called "Success Stories" on the 1C website without tears.  That‚Äôs why their vacancies are open 365 days a year. <br>  The management of franchises cannot understand a simple thing, that the key to success of a modern IT company is not a position in the notorious 1C company rating, but in the creation and retention of a team of highly qualified specialists. <br><br>  Or the franchisee company 1C, after all, is not an IT company, but a kind of McDonald's ??? <br>  So far, the company 1C in its rating partner takes into account purely quantitative, not qualitative indicators, which turns it into a profanation.  As a result, 90% of the published so-called ‚Äúimplemented solutions‚Äù is the installation of a typical program for ONE (sic!) User, and the so-called ‚Äúcustomer reviews‚Äù are riveted by writing the company name, surname and signature of the accountant into the sample form with a ballpoint pen.  Do not believe?  Then go to the site v8.1c.ru in the section "Implemented solutions." <br><br>  There will not be a self-respecting specialist, driving for a day to several places in Moscow, and even with fines for non-call and delay, if there are SUCH number of 1C programmer jobs for end customers whose business is much more profitable than any French business.  It is difficult, probably, to find a qualified 1C programmer who will work in a cheap office without a fixed workplace, and with limited everything you can? <br><br>  Partners 1C elementary lose competition for a scarce resource (qualified 1C specialists) to other sectors of the economy and therefore their business is doomed.  Just as the classic American cars left the market during the 70s oil crisis, with an engine of 6 liters and consuming 35 liters per 100 km. <br>  I will make a reservation that in my reasoning I do not take into account the case of masochism, and I suppose that any person strives to achieve his goals with the minimum expenditure of physical, mental and moral efforts. <br><br>  We distinguish 3 categories of employees of a typical franchisee company.  I will try to analyze each of them. <br><br>  1) "ITS Delivery Man".  There is nothing left for them to do, how to work in France, transporting ITS disks and making adjustments for several hours of development, since their experience and knowledge are not enough to move to another place. <br><br>  2) "Workaholic average".  They do not grab the stars from heaven, and take diligence and diligence.  It is much more important for such people to have a stable income and confidence in the future than to have a ‚Äúnew interesting task‚Äù every day, with the risks of working with a new customer.  These people can get more money by accompanying atypical 1C configurations from medium-sized customers, while spending MUCH LESS efforts.  When a person works every day with the same konfoy, then, even without having seven spans in his forehead, after a while he will know ‚Äúall her cracks‚Äù and solve the arising problems / tasks with a single eyebrow movement. <br>  In addition, among this type of people often come across people with good management skills.  At the end client, over time, they may well make a managerial career, for example, becoming the head of an IT department, <br>  and thereby to get off the 1C needle. <br><br>  3) "Stars".  Every day they want to learn something new, to achieve their goals.  Sooner or later, these people will become crowded within 1C.  The world leaders of the IT market are already waiting for them with open arms: SAP CIS, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle.  They have special retraining programs for new employees (for example, the SAP Talent Net program <a href="http://sapboard.ru/forums/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D37254">http://sapboard.ru/forums...37254</a> ).  In these companies, ‚Äústars‚Äù can make an international career, having received status, money and social circle, inconceivable for 1Snik.  You can opt for large system integrators, such as CROC, IBS, Microtest, etc. These companies have 1C practice, however, they are not focused on one vendor that ‚Äúhas‚Äù them in all slots.  They are large financially stable structures with hundreds of millions of dollars in turnover and millions of dollars of share capital (for example, <a href="http://www.croc.ru/about/">www.croc.ru/about</a> ). <br>  And what is the share capital of a large franchisee?  The case is not 10 thousand rubles? <br><br>  Or maybe a ‚Äústar‚Äù will attract the independence of freelancers.  Why should he give his uncle 60-70% of the money when the client needs his knowledge, experience and professionalism personally, and not ‚Äúmonitoring client satisfaction in accordance with the ISO 9001: 2000 standard‚Äù from the girls ‚Äúmanagers‚Äù of French ??? <br><br>  And what do you say about IT-divisions of large commodity companies, often numbering several thousand people in the state?  And, for example, individual 1C configurations of Mezhregiongaz, Rolf, or Incom, in comparison with which the UPP rests, and which are accompanied by dozens of specialists?  Do they also have to solve routine, standard tasks from day to day ???? <br><br>  What is most funny, these grandees, with their magic compensation packages and prospects, have more liberal working conditions!  The management of the franchise ignores the fact that all these penalties for late arrivals, non-calling, non-marking of the calendar, etc., are expressly prohibited by labor laws, and may entail responsibility of the management of the firm up to criminal law.  On the total tax evasion francs, I generally keep quiet. <br><br>  1C is proud that 1C: Enterprise is the only platform solution in the world that is used to automate small businesses, including creating individual configurations from scratch.  The solutions of other vendors for small businesses are only ‚Äúcustomizable‚Äù, i.e.  in them, the business logic is rigidly sewn in the form of compiled libraries, and only a parametric setting of the program by ‚Äúticking‚Äù is possible. <br><br>  I will express a seditious thought.  There are no more platform solutions for small businesses in the world, not because SAP, Microsoft and Sage are more stupid than 1C, but because the leaders of the global IT market have long understood that such solutions are simply NOT economically VALUABLE to create.  Small businesses simply cannot afford to consume the services of a programmer, just as the services of Big4 auditors cannot afford. <br><br>  It is in Russia that adult men can receive 10-20 thousand rubles each, installing standard updates and making minor adjustments, and their employers do not pay taxes, fine, sit in disgusting offices, saving on everything you can.  In the West, with their total tax control, militant trade unions, and people with dignity, any Frenchman would go bankrupt in a month !!! <br><br>  Admit to yourself how much a typical 1C franchisee would have stayed afloat if he paid all taxes, fully complied with labor laws, and rented an office at least B-class? <br><br>  In fact, there is an objective criterion for the success of a business operating in the services sector.  This is the development of one employee.  The data can be obtained, for example, from the annual rating of Russian IT companies published by Expert magazine.  Data for 2007 can be seen on the website of the journal <a href="http://www.expert.ru/tables/expert/2008/16/document395001/">http://www.expert.ru/tabl...5001/</a> Were you able to find there at least one franc?  :)))) Please note that the production per employee of many companies exceeds one million rubles a month. <br>  I know that in several other francs from the top ten this indicator is about 50 thousand rubles per month.  LASTING IN TENS TIMES !!!  This is a monstrously inefficient use of human resources! <br><br>  It reminds me of the situation with the Soviet Union.  According to Western economists, in the last decades of its existence, the USSR created NEGATIVE GDP, i.e.  the market value of the resources consumed exceeded the market value of the goods produced. <br><br>  I think the 1C company should roll out the ITS project by going to update the standard software products via the Internet, as is customary all over the world.  How many labor resources will be released, which are so lacking in factories and plants :))) !!! <br><br>  Franches need to switch to the provision of any services with a minimum unit of account not 1 hour, but 1 day, as is customary with other vendors.  If the client can not pay for the individual setting of several tens of thousands of rubles, then this setting does not need him, and he can do well with Excel !!! <br><br>  This would greatly improve the market of franchising 1C, automatically washing away a bunch of small dumping offices and weak specialists, and would start the process of market consolidation, giving rise to new large financially stable structures.  At the same time, this would raise the prestige of the work of the 1C programmer.  This will cause an influx of new talent.  Well, you must understand that a graduate of the Moscow State Medical University graduate, who receives 150 thousand rubles, and a vocational school graduate who receives 20 thousand rubles, cannot work together.  These are completely different people, with different values ‚Äã‚Äãand worldview.  There is no sustainable team.  That is why such a turnover is observed in French. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://forum.rabota.ru/%3Farea%3Dv3_forumMessageList%26tid%3D152965%26type%3Dlist%26start%3D40">Source of</a></i>  <i>The text is slightly edited, the mention of a particular company and its representatives has been removed.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71185/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71185/</a></p>
