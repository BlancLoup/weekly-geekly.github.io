  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New music portal ...)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Maybe it seems to me, and maybe not, but lately everyone is doing just that flash games and Internet radio ... From this point of view, our project does not shine with originality ...) But still we tried to make it- its unique and lay in him great potential for potential development.  As far as we succeeded, time will tell, but for now I want to tell you a little about the actual work done. <br>  So, what kind of project is this?  And this project is a cross between Internet radio and a <s>flash game by a</s> social network. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Musical component </h4><br>  The main thing on the portal is of course music.  Its a lot.  And there will be even more.  And if there is music, it means you need to listen to it somehow!  For this purpose, we made a special player, the main charm of which is that the stream is not interrupted during site navigation, which is achieved by a banal popup.  The uniqueness of the player is that the radio is controlled from any of the players, from any open portal page or from the popup itself. <br>  So far, everyone can use the portal for the full program and completely free.  All you need is to register.  Although in the future it is planned to divide users into paid and not so much;  Naturally, with the restriction of some functions for the latter. <br>  For unregistered users, there are several preset radio streams.  The registered playlist has its own playlist, in which the user adds the music, wandering through the music archives ... <br><br><h4>  Social component </h4><br>  Communities are also music-directed and mostly designed to create announcements about any musical events and writing reports about past events.  Or just photo-video-audio reports.  However, only authors of communities can create multimedia posts, or privileged users - ‚Äúphotographers‚Äù or ‚ÄúDJs‚Äù. <br>  Along with the communities, the ‚Äúsociality‚Äù of the project is given to user profiles - and in fact not even just profiles, but full-fledged personal websites, with data about the user, his photo and video galleries and personal playlists. <br>  Another remarkable feature of the portal is internal IM.  The community itself and the community seem to be, but what is important is that it is built on the basis of a jabber server, which in the future will allow it to be opened to the world and, perhaps, even enter the portal using any jabber account. <br>  And since we are talking about technology, I will briefly, finally, describe the technical side of the project.  Next will be a couple of tedious paragraphs with technical details, you can not read them.) <br><br><h4>  Technical Details </h4><br>  The project is written in PHP5, MySQL database.  XSLT is used as a template engine.  Nginx server. <br>  Slightly lifting the veil of secrecy, I will say that the kernel is built in such a way that each page is assembled from a number of separate modules with the help of SSI, which allows flexibly spreading the load to several physical servers.  Moreover, Nginx itself builds SSI and XSLT transformations, which allows Memcached to cache the output of each module separately and thus minimize the access to PHP. <br>  Thus, the process of building any page looks like this: the site receives the request, determines the list of modules required on this page using the routing system, collects XML with a set of SSI connections and gives it to Nginx.  Nginx checks every connection - if there is one already in Memcached - immediately it comes out and goes further, if not - it addresses the specified address and receives XML with the results of the module, which is written to Memcached and the next time will not be processed why nothing. <br>  Well, after that, Nginx compiles the ‚Äúbig‚Äù XML compiled using the above described method into HTML using XSL templates cached in it.  And already ready HTML is given to the user's browser. <br>  A separate server is also allocated for all static data - Tssov, pictures, the actual file content of the portal.  There is nothing particularly interesting there - he only knows how to quickly give static.  :) <br>  Naturally, this is only a small fraction of the technical descriptions of the project, but about the rest - some other time.  In the end, it is impossible to let out all the secrets at once ...;)

    <h4>  Epilogue </h4><br>  And in conclusion, it should be noted that the project is certainly still far from ideal and lacking a lot, something is not very convenient, and in general ... But I want to believe that everything will be in time!  =) <br>  So - meet - <a href="http://madloud.com/">http://madloud.com/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60915/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60915/</a></p>
