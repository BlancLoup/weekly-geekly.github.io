Reboot</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://www.radikal.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/689/8fe/012/6898fe0128151cd95f325e3061c60618.jpg"></a> <br>  The organizers tried to supplement the atmosphere of the Reboot with musical tracks, their appearance and, of course, the morphius core question: ‚ÄúRed pill or blue?‚Äù After answering, the pill was somehow not allowed to be swallowed, but thrown into a 9-liter glass goblet.  After registering with the receipt of food stamps in the Victoria restaurant, visitors passed to the conference room, where the head of the Webcomb delivered a short introductory speech straight from the stairs.  Either as a joke, or seriously, Denis Guryev mentioned a customs union that will finally open up new markets for Belarusian enterprises.  His speech was interrupted by web committee agent Smith, who reported on the presence in the hall of a malicious <s>non-payer of alimony</s> black optimizer.  After that, the visitor with the lucky number 91 was tied up and taken out of the hall under bewildered glances, and then in the closet near the toilet they were kicked for a long time - honestly, he saw). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After the sweep, Leonid Muravyov and Alexander Chekan made speeches who did not kick anyone, but merely told about the audience of the Bynet.  The report of Leonid largely repeated information from the JI.  The main innovation, answering the question of the moderator of forum.searchengines.ru, he promised to clear Akavita from dead souls by Saturday evening, and they were about to install 3 new servers and then you certainly cannot see Akavita falling.  Alexander spoke about the situation with the domains, told about the megatrudable girl who alone opposes the army of evil Belarusian social workers, processing more than fifty requests to the catalog daily.  There was also some information on statistics of hits and clicks on direct, special placement and official links. <br><br>  Sergei Skorokhod has compiled ‚Äúthe first in Belarus rating of SEO companies‚Äù.  In short, the tensor multiplication of HF queries matrices for the module of ‚Äúexpert opinions‚Äù yielded the only correct conclusion.  Webcom is the champion.

      After him, Karina Chernysh made a report on the subversive activities of the flagships of the Belarusian industry.  It turns out that Atlant, <a href="http://pinskdrev.by/">Pinskdrev</a> , BelAZ and their ilk do not comply with the directives of the President (yes, this word is necessarily a capital letter).  Instead of successful work for export, they failed to create English-language versions of sites and hang out outside the TOP-100 on thematic requests.  It turned out that a representative of one of the pest enterprises was present in the hall.  A comrade from Vityaz carried some kind of flow of words about the fact that their website fully corresponds to their business model, and the link to the non-existent English version of the website costs only because ‚Äúthey call every week from the ministry.‚Äù  The lack of progress on Russia was due to the fact that their local representatives advised them, to put it mildly, to sit quietly and not to rock the boat.  Strange ... I understand, if their dealers made huge sales volumes and asked simply not to interfere, and here the warehouses are overstocked, but nothing needs to be done.  Here they are - the realities of the Belarusian market socialism.  And then a phrase was said that provoked the most stormy applause, laughter, tears and steam from the ears.  In response to comments on the availability of copies of the pages, a smart answer followed: ‚ÄúYandex has already adapted to our site!‚Äù <br><br>  After lunch, a representative of the <a href="http://pro-trade.by/">pro-trade</a> furniture company spoke about his thoroughly positive experience from working with Webcom.  About how the monthly SEO budget of 1,000,000 rubles brings them tens of thousands of American presidents.  He told about his vision of the signed agreements and agreements of gentlemen‚Äôs and promised to hit not the passport, but the face, if suddenly the support goes over to the competitors. <br><br>  The second half of the day was, by and large, the benefit of a semi-Belorus) Sadovsky.  In two reports he told a lot of useful (and for most obvious) things, told about the fight against industrial surges of references, that over the past 2 years the reference factor has more than halved.  But, unfortunately, it was quite expected that the topics were not even burned before the countrymen.  Is that promised Yandex.bu in the near future.  He also did not forget to remind once again that they are essentially white and fluffy, and not <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB">cannibals</a> , like <a href="http://mail.ru/">some</a> . <br><br>  The first day of the conference was concluded by a round table, which was held in the format "Sadovsky and everything, everything, everything."  At the end of this dialogue, he wished the Belarusian SEO specialists the main thing: ‚ÄúHappiness in your personal life.‚Äù <br><br>  All who read to the end of the proposed bonus puzzle.  What is it? <br> <a href="http://www.radikal.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1a/f1d/010/a1af1d010a82a761d285f1aa9b1db1c0.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77232/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77232/</a></p>
