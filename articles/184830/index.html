      This initiative is part of our plan to make C ++ one of the languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat would be fully supported in our products - both in ReSharper and in a separate <a href="http://blog.jetbrains.com/objc/2013/04/c-ide-an-april-fools-day-joke/" title="http://blog.jetbrains.com/objc/2013/04/c-ide-an-april-fools-day-joke/">cross-platform development environment</a> that we announced earlier this year. <br><br>  C ++ is a very powerful language that has not gone away for all these years, despite the emergence and growth of its ‚Äúhereditary languages‚Äù C # or Java: today a lot of code is written in this language and will be used for a very long time. .  We at JetBrains believe that our toolkit can help C ++ developers develop faster and more efficiently. <br><br><h3>  Feature set </h3><br>  Parsing a language like C ++ is not easy, especially if you consider all that preprocessing and template processing, which is especially time-consuming in large projects.  Our main goal is precisely the correctness of processing all possible nuances, and a large amount of effort was taken just to ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù C ++, regardless of the specific features used in the language.  At the moment we have not so much <em>visible</em> functionality, but a lot of fundamental work has been done.  Today, those internal builds that we prepare include the following functionality: <br><br><ul><li>  <strong>Syntax highlighting</strong> support <br></li><li>  A complete set of navigation support mechanisms including mechanisms such as <strong>Go to Type</strong> , <strong>Go to Symbol</strong> , <strong>Go to File Member</strong> and of course the new <strong>Go to Everything</strong> specific to ReSharper 8. <br></li><li>  Support for <strong>contextual navigation</strong> , incl.  Navigation to the declaration ( <strong>Go to Declaration</strong> ), inherited symbols ( <strong>Derived Symbols</strong> ), basic symbols ( <strong>Base Symbols</strong> ) - in other words, support for all the basic features that can be expected when you open the <em>Navigate To</em> menu: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4fe/07d/9cb/4fe07d9cb72de35cfd01b90c7f165f7b.png"><br><br></li><li>  We also have a search mechanism for using an item ( <strong>Find Usages</strong> ) with a preview, search filters, various grouping options, and everything that usually appears in the <em>Find Usages</em> window. <br></li><li>  The side markers (gutter marks) in the new indicator of possible actions in ReSharper 8 help to track the links between non-traceable elements and make transitions between them: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/136/cf7/b8e/136cf7b8e4cf300d30f3c8b862b88412.png"><br><br></li><li>  <strong>Introduce Variable</strong> Refactoring: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc8/b16/fda/bc8b16fdae8d8c595f798c66179efff1.png"><br></li><li>  Contextual actions for the <strong>substitution of macros</strong> , both individual and nested (i.e. fully completed): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0d0/4f4/3ea/0d04f43eaf5ec97038639f0591ea60f9.png"><br><br></li><li>  <strong>Understanding templates</strong> gives ReSharper the ability to correctly calculate and enable the transition to specific specializations of a particular template: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/32c/df9/16b/32cdf916b191aa4d1d012b98db81618e.png"><br><br></li></ul><br>  To give you an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat can be expected from the current support of C ++ in ReSharper, I suggest watching this screencast: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RL8aEtU2D14%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgv4gyEOfthVPhnnHiqld8I3UpEnw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3>  How to try it all? </h3><br>  At the moment we have no public builds with which to experiment, and the <strong>current EAP does not include support for C ++</strong> .  It will take us a few more months to get something that is worth showing to the general public.  But if you don‚Äôt want to wait, here‚Äôs what you can do: <br><br><ul><li>  Go to the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/cpp.html%3Fdotnetblog" title="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/cpp.html?dotnetblog">C ++ support page</a> on our website. <br></li><li>  <strong>Fill out the form</strong> with a description of the C ++ extensions, libraries and language versions that you use.  We apologize for such a large ‚Äúquestionnaire‚Äù, but believe me - this information is very important for us to understand what it is worth working on in the first place. <br></li><li>  <strong>Send us a subscription request for private assemblies ReSharper with built-in C ++ support</strong> .  As soon as we have a private build that can function with your environment settings, we will send you an e-mail with a link to download. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  What is next? </h3><br><ul><li>  First of all, I would like to emphasize once again that C ++ support <strong>will not be included in ReSharper 8</strong> because it is still ‚Äúraw‚Äù for a full production release. <br></li><li>  In the next few months, our team will work on supporting C ++ to present a <strong>public EAP this fall</strong> .  As we add support for new language versions, platform-specific extensions, as well as support for new versions of Visual Studio, we will send private builds to those who subscribe to them. <br></li><li>  At the moment, we are almost ready to support C / C ++ 03 for small and medium-sized projects that either do not use third-party libraries at all, or use small ones.  The current <strong>development plan</strong> for the next few months looks something like this: <br><ul><li>  Support for small and medium-sized projects that use larger libraries, such as Boost <br></li><li>  C ++ 11 support <br></li><li>  Guarantee of adequate work with large projects <br></li><li>  Support for Visual Studio-specific extensions, as well as support for MFC / ATL / WTL <br></li></ul><br><br></li><li>  Once we have everything ready for a public release, we will open the early access program (EAP) and, after public testing, add C ++ support to the main ReSharper build so that C ++ support will become <strong>part of ReSharper Full Edition</strong> . <br></li></ul><br>  Well, interesting?  Maybe you have been waiting for this news?  Then <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/cpp.html%3Fdotnetblog" title="http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/features/cpp.html?dotnetblog">sign up for private builds</a> and, working with them, help us make C ++ support part of ReSharper as quickly as possible.  Well, do not hesitate to tell us exactly what you would like to see in terms of C ++ support in the comments to this post.  Thank! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/184830/">https://habr.com/ru/post/184830/</a></p>
