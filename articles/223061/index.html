In a few minutes, all your current iPhones will become obsolete sheets of metal with pieces of glass and plastic.  Android users can also not particularly rejoice: and a couple of weeks will not pass, as manufacturers nashtampuyut various "killers of the sixth iPhone": thinner, faster and clearer - your carriage in the same way will turn into pumpkins! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/575/952/4f6/5759524f6f6c4ea0925aadc68722f45c.jpg"><br><br>  Okay, maybe the psychologist of me is not very.  Therefore, welcome to the cat: there is something interesting for those who do not have the opportunity to watch the online broadcast. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The live stream is available directly on <a href="http://www.apple.com/live/2014-sept-event/">the Apple website</a> or in a special channel on Apple TV set-top boxes.

      About upcoming updates can be read in a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/235801/">previous post</a> . <br><br>  Ordered a pizza in the office Habr.  I think now in many offices of various publications there is a small chaos: someone is preparing to take screenshots of the recording and process pictures for uploading, someone - to translate the presentation, someone - to write the text of the announcement.  I decided to try to do it all alone: ‚Äã‚Äãperhaps this is the only format of posts that I did not have time to try during the years of my stay on Habr√©.  I hope to succeed, if anything - correct. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Just in case</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  r - update comments <br>  f - to the first new comment <br>  j / k - navigation on new comments </div></div><br>  So, Tim Cook, Apple's new CEO, appears on the scene.  As a background image behind him - a whole army of generations of iPhones.  Indistinct speech in the bourgeois language ... and yes, it represents something for which everyone today gathered at the screens: the new <b>iPhone 6</b> and <b>iPhone 6 Plus</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/823/5d5/608/8235d56086e549159990e82f27b23d76.jpg"><br><br>  Both devices are equipped with a new Retina-display, this time with an HD prefix.  As expected - two screen sizes: 4.7 and 5.5 inches.  The resolutions are 1334x750 (326 ppi) and 1920x1080 (401 ppi), respectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4b/9f5/13a/d4b9f513acbe4e4c81bd55ee94694f5f.jpg"><br><br>  The thickness of smartphones also decreased: 6.9 and 7.1 millimeters.  The thickness of the iPhone 5S was 7.6 mm. <br>  The weight of new products is 129 and 172 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b2/9b3/125/8b29b31254f44e238668a42bfd2ad1f4.jpg"><br><br>  I have a bad English, but they say something about two SIM cards and illegible about an android. <br><br>  iPhone 6 Plus has learned to change the orientation.  Screen :) If earlier it was possible only in several applications and when typing, now support for landscape orientation has become much wider. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cba/17f/e8d/cba17fe8d7da4e9d8c61688d7abb639c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/410/bf3/2cc/410bf32cc09e4c4c923947f83118f21f.jpg"><br><br>  The large screen diagonal began to dictate terms: the first one touched the power button ‚Äî it moved from the upper end to the right side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/245/90e/429/24590e4296c14967955d53a3d7cc5c29.jpg"><br><br>  Inside installed a new 64-bit A8 processor (technical process - 20nm).  The presentation slides say that it is 13% less than the predecessor A7, while becoming 20% ‚Äã‚Äãfaster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06d/451/bc4/06d451bc4b4d4ebdb4be9b7b41f12db5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68d/75f/662/68d75f6620364fc6abfd501126164c0e.jpg"><br><br>  The performance of the new graphics system has grown by 50%, thereby Apple has conquered the new peak of the performance of its mobile devices.  To demonstrate the capabilities of iron on the iPhone, they launch a resource-intensive three-dimensional toy: everything flies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bee/852/b04/bee852b04d7b466f9057a2955ef8a054.jpg"><br><br>  As for battery life, the most impressive is the iPhone 6 Plus: all indicators (relative to iPhone 5S) almost doubled.  The usual iPhone 6 is a bit more modest: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15b/1f8/f49/15b1f8f49a024093ad45a0809714ee48.jpg"><br><br>  The novelty has a new sensor: a barometer.  The new coprocessor (M8) will be able to distinguish your activity - when you ride a foxhole or run, and also calculate distances and heights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/834/99a/7b8/83499a7b80a243cc866c64eba4f61afa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/270/a88/218/270a88218ba44c4db5cd9dae593c15b0.jpg"><br><br>  Inside, there is also an updated LTE module, the maximum speed of which can reach (in theory) 160 Mbit / s.  There is support for voice transmission over the LTE network. <br><br>  Wi-Fi is also accelerated, three times - due to the long-awaited standard Wi-Fi 802ac.  About NFC is not a word. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42a/2a5/974/42a2a5974ffe4a7dabdfc99d85148423.jpg"><br><br>  The new 5-lens main camera module (iSight with a new sensor) with a more nimble autofocus (two times compared to 5S - due to the Pixel Plus technology), optical stabilization and a new face recognition technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d7/fbf/c05/0d7fbfc05e3c427ab04e8332f6a4879d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c5/878/c3d/9c5878c3d08e4753948c6b3bbb9b9feb.jpg"><br><br>  The camera will stick out a bit from the case - alas, they didn‚Äôt push it.  Here are the specifications: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/621/165/154/621165154ad74c14876675d0a4978c2c.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, in the afternoon some cunning Chinese posted examples of pictures from the new iPhone, in the dark - it looks good.  As well as the snapshots from the presentation - on some of them you can see the National Geographic copyright, which hints. <br><br>  What is most interesting is how optical stabilization works: some Nokia Lumia models work little wonders in this regard.  In short, you have to watch live. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/524/93d/fca/52493dfca9fd4131b850540c81e682de.jpg"><br><br>  Using the camera, you can make 43-megapixel panoramas, as well as shoot SlowMotion-video with 240 (!) Frames per second.  Cool. <br>  Normal video (meaning FullHD) can be shot at 30 or 60 frames per second.  FaceTime has also been updated: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5de/aad/3e5/5deaad3e56dc4610a1d3e0add1b77847.jpg"><br><br>  New items running the new iOS8.  There is nothing new here - everything that is, was presented at WWDC 2014. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f7/92d/7bb/1f792d7bbfe1499fb0f4f998408ff9fc.jpg"><br><br>  About new iPhones in one slide: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8a/864/1f2/b8a8641f2eb543fca0de8e88b9ef1aee.jpg"><br><br>  Announced the cost (with a two-year contract).  The price for the younger model iPhone 6 (16GB) is 199 evergreen presidents.  At the same time, please note that there is no 32 GB model - after 16 there are 64 GB at once (for 299 presidents), which is rather strange: taking into account the new features of the camera, it would be more logical to exclude the 16 Gigabyte model.  But the appearance of a model with a 128-gigabyte memory module ($ 399) is nice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5c/449/c62/d5c449c62f514039b5f89a9ad025d6f8.jpg"><br><br>  Prices for iPhone 6 Plus start at $ 299 (for 16GB) and end at $ 499 (128GB).  If you think that it is expensive, then pay attention to the previous 5S - with a contract, the price for it starts from $ 99, and 5C is offered for free.  Is that speech, of course, not about our country. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca5/eb8/a5b/ca5eb8a5be38425dbbf6923a5b37a1c5.jpg"><br><br>  Slide with possible colors of the case and Russian prices: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/034/7a2/980/0347a298048d4cdc925b93a3d541a77a.jpg"><br><br>  Pre-order will begin on September 12, on sale - from 19. Until the end of 2014, new iPhones will be sold in 115 countries (surprised that there are so many countries). <br><br>  As for iOS8, it will be available for download from September 17, while nothing is said about the jailbreak.  List of supported devices: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bc/674/dd1/4bc674dd1ff348b987d4b730227c63cb.jpg"><br><br>  Tim Cook has returned to the scene.  And kaaak started talking about the new payment system! <br><br>  We are talking about NFC.  Or not about NFC.  Whatever it was, we are convinced that ordinary cards have long been morally obsolete, although in Russia they have not yet appeared everywhere :) By the way, yes, they say that wallets (even if they are from the skin of a tyrannosaur) are also not fashionable . <br><br>  Oh, here we are.  Meet the new payment system - <b>Apple Pay</b> ! <br><br>  Successful name - on many sites and in applications there will be a button <img src="http://beta.hstor.org/files/ceb/ff3/ef8/cebff3ef8ace441396150fd1386b6d8f.png" alt="image">  <b>Pay</b> . <br><br>  With a new chip for a secure connection, support for Touch ID and Blackjack (with the support of MasterCard, Visa and American Express). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/460/c42/0c1/460c420c100444e7852f2b4f910d4d1d.jpg"><br><br>  A number of gourmet banks have already agreed to work with the new payment system, namely: Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, Citi and Wells Fargo (soon there are five more banks, but also American ones). <br><br>  Pizza and tea are cold.  The broadcast is constantly falling - we do not see it just as your cashiers will not see your cards in the store.  Paying with Apple Pay will be as simple and secure as possible. <br><br>  Adding owner cards to your phone is elegant: you photograph the card and you are done.  Payment - by touching the terminal (due to the NFC-module) The payment itself is confirmed by scanning the fingerprint via TouchID. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c3/bf3/a93/6c3bf3a93aca4966992a2c6597789a95.jpg"><br><br>  Summarizing: <br><table><tbody><tr><td><h3>  Features of iPhone 6: </h3><br>  <b>Screen:</b> 4.7-inch Retina-display with a resolution of 1334x750 pixels, full support for the standard sRGB, enhanced viewing angles and curved protective glass; <br>  <b>Processor:</b> dual-core A8 with 64-bit architecture + M8 motion coprocessor; <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 1 GB of RAM, 16 // 64/128 GB of internal memory without the possibility of expansion; <br>  <b>Main camera:</b> iSight 8 megapixel camera with a pixel size of 1.5¬µ, aperture ∆í / 2.2, autofocus, Focus Pixels technology, five-lens lens and True Tone flash; <br>  <b>Front camera:</b> 1.2 megapixels (1280x960) with a diaphragm ∆í / 2.2; <br>  <b>Modules:</b> LTE, GPS, GLONASS, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, Wi-Fi (802.11 a / b / g / n / ac), NFC; <br>  <b>Sensors:</b> Touch ID, barometer, three-axis gyroscope, accelerometer, distance and ambient light; <br>  <b>Battery:</b> up to 14 hours on the 3G network, up to 11 hours of video viewing, up to 50 hours of music playback; <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 138.1 x67x6.9 mm; <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 129 grams. <br></td><td><h3>  IPhone 6 Plus Features: </h3><br>  <b>Screen:</b> 5.5-inch Retina-display with a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels, full support for the sRGB standard, enhanced viewing angles and a curved protective glass; <br>  <b>Processor:</b> dual-core A8 with 64-bit architecture + M8 motion coprocessor; <br>  <b>Memory:</b> 1 GB of RAM, 16 // 64/128 GB of internal memory without the possibility of expansion; <br>  <b>Main camera:</b> iSight 8 megapixel camera with a pixel size of 1.5¬µ, aperture ∆í / 2.2, autofocus, Focus Pixels technology, five-lens lens, True Tone flash and optical image stabilizer; <br>  <b>Front camera:</b> 1.2 megapixels (1280x960) with a diaphragm ∆í / 2.2; <br>  <b>Modules:</b> LTE, GPS, GLONASS, Bluetooth 4.0 LE, Wi-Fi (802.11 a / b / g / n / ac), NFC; <br>  <b>Sensors:</b> Touch ID, barometer, three-axis gyroscope, accelerometer, distance and ambient light; <br>  <b>Battery:</b> up to 23 hours on the 3G network, up to 14 hours of video viewing, up to 80 hours of music playback; <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 158.1x77.8x7.1 mm; <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 172 grams. <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  So, apparently, on new iPhones for today everything. <br><br><h2>  One more thing ... </h2><br>  Tadam - Tim Cook is on the stage again. <br><br>  Tik-Tak.  Yes, it is a watch.  With a rectangular display, and not with a round, as you all thought! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb3/5e8/164/bb35e81641ec413589e47c03b716ca7e.jpg"><br><br>  Tim Cook says he already bought some. <br><br>  Beautiful presentation, showing many options for how the new watch may look like.  Not like any of the renders.  Stylish trendy youth. <br><br>  The wheel on the side controls the image on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f74/c1f/7aa/f74c1f7aa6ee41f8856f436f032bae1d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d7/189/932/3d7189932aa54f3d8cdd516145aba038.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8c/452/08f/b8c45208fb5243c1b4d6b455bbc96aca.jpg"><br><br>  They say that this is the most "personal" device that has ever been created by the company.  This is not only a watch, but also a device for health and fitness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3db/6fa/6c3/3db6fa6c3cce4591b42f6527540d977b.jpg"><br><br>  Much work has been done on optimizing the interface - this is not just a reduced iPhone interface.  The interface uses new fonts. <br><br>  The watch should look cool on any wrist.  From the thick hand of a loader from Magnit to the fragile handle of a girl :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f93/660/aa3/f93660aa36c24ef3a61916ad0aaf8fbf.jpg"><br><br>  The device has support for Siri and dictation.  The device understands the difference between pressing and tap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6b/bfc/87d/f6bbfc87d0764077bdf7c5ea24bfa81d.jpg"><br><br>  The sensors are on the reverse side - well, who would doubt!  On the reverse side - sapphire crystal.  Read Wikipedia, sapphire is a very cool material, 9 points out of 10 on the Mohs scale of hardness! <br><br>  Support for wireless charging - they are also correct, walking with a wire around the outlet would not be very convenient. <br><br>  While everyone is watching the broadcast of the event in a terrible quality, we have beautiful video stubs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/739/1d1/a23/7391d1a231f442d693f0257c53eac06d.jpg"><br><br>  As expected, the device will be released in two sizes: relatively speaking, for girls and for boys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e84/a91/75a/e84a9175a5b94c8290c2332fb2cde40a.jpg"><br><br>  Straps: from leather to metal.  Total - 6 variations.  There will also be a variation of 18-carat gold. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1c/f5d/de0/f1cf5dde0d2d4291acde34484a858308.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcc/fe3/6bc/fccfe36bc37c4c71951cf4404c9f9d7b.jpg"><br><br>  The vice-president of the company, who also bought the Apple Watch somewhere, stepped onto the stage.  Begins to make a presentation of applications on the clock. <br><br>  Coolest touch support. <br><br>  The choice - a lot of options for the design of the dial - appearance, color, output information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db7/b84/625/db7b84625e5d4601bd6719e9dfd0f700.jpg"><br><br>  From the clock you can control the music from your iPhone or even from your home system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/54c/09b/5b7/54c09b5b7636439e996a1db161768be6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e46/ca4/974/e46ca49744084d4390ed24138ad058bf.jpg"><br><br>  Do not hesitate to anyone, the man begins to correspond with Johnny Ive.  Absolutely unbelted!  Since typing on this screen is not very convenient, therefore, messages can be answered either with a voice or with templates.  There is also support for animated stickers (including emoticons). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/27f/6dc/e89/27f6dce89eef4320a688c79e8c647bb4.jpg"><br><br>  The interface on the clock is completely different from something Apple.  Very cool both outside and inside.  " <i>Switzerland is in danger</i> ". <br><br>  There will be cards on the clock - zoom due to the rotation of the above-mentioned wheel from the side.  There is a navigation mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86e/f80/417/86ef80417a954316a7364fe947e727da.jpg"><br><br>  Regarding contacts and communication with them.  On the screen you can draw various gestures that the system will recognize.  To each contact - on a scrawl! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ec/67d/66d/9ec67d66dee94486bad2f5e2c878c408.jpg"><br><br>  The watch will have interaction with the App Store - I still do not understand, one for all or one of my own.  For developers, the WatchKit toolkit. <br><br>  Facebook, twitter, interaction with BMW i8 (already sold in Russia, price from 8.880.000, all quota sold out) or any other devices in the future - all this will now be possible.  Tesla, of course, is not moved, but I remind you that so far we are talking only about the clock! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b5/b70/118/8b5b70118df044598df7d944b1b88d05.jpg"><br><br>  No wonder so much attention to the clock.  They come up with iPhones every year, and here‚Äôs the clock ... the clock! <br><br>  Now about fitness.  Ive came up with some new icon for this. <br><br>  Sample dial during sports activities: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ca/524/758/4ca5247581344c1ab4ef4f5dd8919ccd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/942/566/dd5/942566dd53e54fcebceb5cb83028fb0e.jpg"><br><br>  And an example of the data transmitted to the iPhone: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/923/334/8b1/9233348b12a7431cb0a3ce9b257419fa.jpg"><br><br>  Tim Cook: " <i>Our watches will make you change your mind about fitness</i> ." <br><br>  Compatible devices: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87a/f3d/752/87af3d752706406398f12a988673c19c.jpg"><br><br>  On sale watch will appear in early 2015 at a price of 350 dollars.  Expensive?  In principle, yes, if you consider that the iPhone 5C with the contract is given free of charge :) On the other hand, I remember my Adidas Smart Run watch, which in Russia was selling for 15-18 thousand apiece and could not even half of all the above. <br><br>  The watch will have an NFC module, which means support for Apple Pay. <br><br>  Something is silent about the battery life.  I heard that this is the weak side of the watch :) It's hard not to agree, considering that there is so much inside. <br><br>  Soooo.  Looks like something else cooked.  " <i>But that's not all - making an order right now ...</i> ". <br><br>  But no, just a musical pause with the participation of the group U2.  But wait a minute - ‚Äúthe call is for the teacher,‚Äù and Tim Cook has not left yet. <br><br>  It is a pity, but no - the performance has come to an end.  Total we have: two new iPhones on steroids, two models of watches with a lot of design options (both outside and inside), a new Apple Pay payment system (which in Russia will work very soon) and the announced release date of the new iOS8.  Rumors are rumored, and with the appearance of iPhones they hit the spot: it turned out to be exactly the same as it was shown on all sites before the announcement.  But the appearance of the Apple Watch for all was a surprise: no one guessed. <br><br>  Apple and well done and not well done at the same time.  Well done - that millions of people around the world were able to make them stare at monitors, and hundreds of sites (including Habr) - lead text online broadcasts;  I do not remember that such a stir reigned at the announcement of any other gadgets or any cars.  Not well done - they could not make a normal online broadcast, but it happens to everyone. <br><br>  As always - you are waiting for something more, but at the end of the event the feeling that something was not shown does not leave.  Nevertheless, a good little bit of everything - the nearest ‚Äúgood‚Äù will be in October: most likely we are talking about updating a number of hardware and the new OS X. We are waiting. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> <br>  The Apple site has been updated, all the information on new products has appeared: <br>  - <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone/compare//">New iPhones</a> : all specifications, comparison with previous models, prices. <br>  - <a href="http://www.apple.com/watch/">Apple Watch</a> - while on the product pages only renders. <br>  - <a href="http://www.apple.com/iphone-6/apple-pay/">Apple Pay</a> <br><br>  The site has a mobile version, so that ¬ß177 Lebedev Kolodstva can be scrolled through. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> No 5S started to slow down?  Yes, and somehow I did not lie in the hand ...) <br><br>  Thank you all for your attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223061/</a></p>
