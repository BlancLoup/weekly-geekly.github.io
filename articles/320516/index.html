And what are you worse?  Oleg Tinkov is not the only one, but there are really few active businessmen in social networks.  For them there hang out PR.  Mark Zuckerberg has a team of personal smmschiki <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-18/this-team-runs-mark-zuckerberg-s-facebook-page">14 people</a> . <br><br>  But in general: if you want to be poor - hang out in a network, if you want to be fired - hang out in a network (unless of course you are Kim Kardashian, Ivan Rudskoy-EeOneGuy or Anatoly Shary).  Such stereoretypes walk in the minds and are sometimes publicly voiced by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/20/jobs/quit-social-media-your-career-may-depend-on-it.html%3F_r%3D0">respected foreign newspapers</a> in a science-like style. <br><br>  The good news is that there is no scientific basis for this.  The conclusion about the absolute harm of social networks is the same case of erroneous induction as the harm of pornography or the benefits of homeopathy.

      Each of us has several friends of young or old age, who are completely absent from social networks.  Even in large cities.  And just according to polls <a href="http://www.levada.ru/2017/01/24/obshhenie-v-sotssetyah/">in the country of 40 percent</a> .  And although their number is slowly decreasing, they feel fine and do not differ from those logged in to the networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b46/7fd/ad3/b467fdad3e4b43c6b49f533c9f77b616.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The arguments of network isolation supporters are quite simple.  There are two of them. <br><br>  The first argument is that a person becomes accustomed to the fastest stimulus, and the brain reacts to this by producing appropriate reflexes at the level of biochemistry.  As a result, the ability to concentrate is lost, time is lost on the development of professional knowledge and the impasse of career growth on the horizon is getting closer. <br><br>  To begin with, we will make a reservation that any monotonous activity leads to similar consequences, and dependence is much more stable in video games, roulette or smoking.  There are people who are distracted from work by anything - a phone call, a conversation with a colleague next door, the sounds of cars outside the window, etc. <br><br>  Habits of consumption of information from social networks also do not depend.  I know people who still do not accept any infographics and charts in documents.  For them, a solid text with almost no design is the ideal format for describing thoughts and writing business papers.  The presentation for them is generally empty empty circus.  An alternative approach to understanding information is represented by children who cannot read easily or lack imagination.  Children in the books definitely need pictures.  That is, I want to say that everything depends on the skills.  If you know how to work with information in the form of social networks - no harm to the social network will bring.  Neither career nor emotional.  What it means to "be able to" - just below <br><br>  The second argument of critics of social networks is the connections and reputation that can be earned by successfully posting trending posts and writing numerous comments, it is easy to acquire outside social networks.  Offline reputation, they say, is more reasonable and a good professional will find suffering customers and recruiters, even outside of social networks. <br><br>  Of course, for many, offline as a field of competition and career competition is better suited.  Undoubtedly, scattering advertisements on mailboxes for window manufacturers can be much more beneficial than getting from the spot to the top contextual issue or buying advertising in Direct or AdWords.  And for the new store next door, the sign is 100 times more important than online advertising.  And so it is not with one product and business. <br><br>  Tearing away from interactive online, a person may well concentrate instead of work and career on making solitaire or reading jokes.  Career it will help even less.  But the trend in the search for employees on the "big data", the bulk of which is supplied by social networks, is undeniable.  Not to mention the simple search for candidates in social networks by posts from customers who are tired of hundreds of resumes. <br><br>  Let us leave private reservations to the main point - separately, neither by the strength of dependence, nor by the depth of influence on the brain, nor by the time the social network is far from being the strongest tool. <br><br>  Yes, interactive online has features - it is readily available almost everywhere, it encourages for active active attention - all discussions of an important post usually have one peak of activity, rarely two, many posts and the old ones are almost not found, and having found, rarely with whom is that discuss. <br><br>  Huskies are a variant of quick psychological encouragement (strokes, as psychologists call it), and violent, even if empty comments reinforce the effect of personal significance. <br><br>  Because of these features, many people have a feeling of guilt for hanging on social networks.  Someone even completely removed from social networks with the removal of archives and the replacement of the smartphone on the old push-button phone.  Most often useless. <br><br>  The fact is that the struggle with interactive online is an attempt to forcefully narrow the funnel of attention to the important, which is not felt important.  It is recognized as important only by the mind and not supported by emotions.  Otherwise, it is an attempt to escape from excess free time caused by the absence of their goals or to leave the situation of an unsolvable or alien goal. <br><br>  Having a meaningful goal in offline easily replaces the pleasures of social surfing.  Man is so constituted that psychological encouragement must be accompanied by physiological.  It is even considered that from the physiological all psychological pleasures and evolved.  Football on the field and football on the screen are two completely different pleasures.  With the communication or study of any topic of the post outside its online boundaries the same story. <br><br>  This is all to the fact that killing social addiction is easy.  This is always a consequence than a cause.  Well, except for the newbies of internet surfing.  Anyone who has unlearned from some bad habit will make an approximate set of unlearning and replacement equipment. <br><br><h1>  Still it is a habit </h1><br>  And if you decide to give up this habit you need not much time.  In favor of some other one I do not know, but it is easier to do if social surfing is being replaced with something - with another habit or goal. <br><br>  The ideal case of course - "the man said - the man did."  But by virtue of a quiet life, such feats cause an inner person to wonder inside and he will be detached from them.  The transition from one "comfort zone" (another okolopsihologichesky term) to another - requires the will, purpose or route.  As a rule, most need exactly the route - it is also the instruction to combat the habit. <br><br>  Transition technology works like this.  Compare the transition from one comfort zone to another.  This is reminiscent of the transition from a warm home with a computer, the Internet and social networks to a warm bowling for a corporate birthday under a cold windy sky. <br><br>  When the decision is made to go, but laziness (no ability) to gather - a person leaves, for example, without an umbrella (well, forgot or broken) and falls under the rain. <br><br>  Well, such an inexperienced person comes across, that each time he takes something previously necessary, but not everything.  Forget the boots, the hat, the car keys (travel card), the money for gas, the note with the address ... <br><br>  In general, and every time his house is waiting for the Internet and hot coffee, warm tea, cold beer ... Every way out there is a chance to give up and say - but I won‚Äôt be on time, I‚Äôll be late, I will drink like a fool to drink (to look ridiculous). <br><br>  Every time a person is getting closer to a new comfort zone, to a new habit, but there is less certainty that he will succeed.  Although he is getting closer to the goal.  This is the meaning of the transition technique - remember about success (about an umbrella, I already took it, and did not forget the car keys ...), which allow you to make the transition also a small comfort zone that you yourself create, and not an external swamp that bothers you of the way. <br><br>  With the rejection of social surfing as well.  The set of operations that must be done is limited and the abandonment of the old habit is guaranteed.  It is believed that a month is more than enough.  In this case, the main thing is not to panic in case of failures, but to remember the successful steps.  Soon there will be more. <br><br>  Outside of the tricks, the best thing is having a real goal and organized memory.  Organized memory is even more important.  We all have affairs always.  And a well-working memory will remind both of the case, and the consequences arising from his case / idleness, and even alternative solutions to the problem, which has driven into social surfing. <br><br>  Simply put, if you have the technology and the habit of tying ‚Äúmemory knots‚Äù, and most importantly, the memory itself is trained, then the social networks will only help you.  You would not have read the article before this line.  To a person with an excellent and organized memory, it will seem strange in its irrelevance. <br><br><h1>  Receivers </h1><br><ol><li>  Complicate the search for engagement.  Scatter all the Freds in 30-50 lists and leave no one in the main auto-filled tape. </li><li>  Mark the value of discussions.  Keep in the open window the meaning of the discussion of the current post and record all the meaning in a row in this list-file (social surfing diary) </li><li>  Create a competition of interest.  For each post in the course of the discussion, find 2-3 more interesting articles on the Internet </li><li>  One of the main reasons why rejection of social surfing is difficult - there is a place to be an escape from a choice or from the meaninglessness of a choice.  For such a case there is a trick - to create a competition of goals.  Open a few files on the results of the discussion and try to bring them to their own volumetric reasoning-research.  If the topic is interesting, it will enthrall and relieve the anxiety caused by the main difficulty. <br>  Who would like what trick - let him replace the senselessness of social surfing. </li><li>  Increase benefit = reduce harm + increase controllability. <br>  Signing for themselves the benefits of social networks will be easier to break away from the fruitless posts and activity for the sake of activity. </li></ol><br>  For example, you can create for yourself such a questionnaire, register it 10 times within 30 days to evaluate each post by type: <br><br><ul><li>  Social networks are trends.  What is the trend? </li><li>  Social networks are pain points.  What is the pain point? </li><li>  Social networks is awareness.  Who is the best author aware of the subject of the post? </li></ul><br>  Any systematic approach will improve the ease of switching from task to task without sticking to a stream of random signals.  Start easy: draw the simplest list ‚Äî how any information / any discussion can be useful and keep it close at hand.  Then tick off when surfing.  Be sure to insert the item "useful unknown for what."  And your social network career is no longer an enemy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/320516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/320516/</a></p>
