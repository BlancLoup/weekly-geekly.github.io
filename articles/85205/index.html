I am not booming in the reviews, but I must try.  To understand what is being discussed and with which I will be comparing the unit all the time, I send you to the professional review: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/66460/">‚ÄúReview of the BBK PopcornTV NP101S network player‚Äù</a> I use the prefix for about two weeks, so I didn‚Äôt manage to test everything.  Before that, I had an A-110 year, so I will mainly compare it with it.  And still - photos will be drawn from everywhere, whence it is possible, yes hosters of these pictures, whoever they are, will forgive me the habraeffect &lt;/ disclaimer&gt; <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On January 28, Popcorn Hour began accepting applications for the Popcornhour A-200 media extender.  I immediately wanted it, because in it, as it seemed to me (and not in vain it seemed), the problem of suspension due to overheating had to be solved.  Therefore, I didn‚Äôt look at the specifications much - I just went and ordered.  But it is time to catch up.  So, <br><br><h4>  specs / comparison </h4><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Connectivity

Manufactured <br>  under license from Dolby Laboratories. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  If we compare it with the A-110, the hardware has significantly improved and some functions associated with playing BD have been added (I‚Äôm not interested personally), AVCHD navigation (potentially interesting, because my camera writes AVCHD, the new interface Rich UI, which we not yet shown, application center, widgets (maybe) and everything is as it should be. Innovations in hardware look more impressive - the processor frequency doubled, the RAM doubled, the flash volume quadrupled, S / PDIF appeared. <br><br><h4>  Feelings and initial setup </h4><br>  What did it give me - the average user - other than the awareness of what is higher / higher / next?  And gave, I must say, a lot.  The feeling is that everything flies, lists of films are instantly scrolled, playback starts, screens change, fragments are rewound.  I did not count on it, but I was very pleasantly impressed.  To be completely clear - I did not have the slightest claim to the A-110, but in the new A-200 the sensations improved by an order of magnitude. <br>  I think those users of the A-110 (and other syabas-based consoles) will be interested to learn about one feature of the A-200 even before its purchase - there will be no such surprise as mine.  The fact is that the A-200 can install its applications on the screws, taken out of the "old" consoles, only by preformatting them.  Surprise-surprise, I have a half a terabyte of information that I don‚Äôt have to throw myself.  I wriggled out by connecting the console through the USB-slave to the computer, and draining all the information on it (about 20 MB / s speed) - it took about six hours.  But I downloaded it back over the network, the router pumps about 7 Mb / s and the whole operation took almost 18 hours.  Be ready‚Ä¶ <br>  Another surprise, which I may have avoided, and maybe it would not have happened - this is the installation of applications after formatting the hard drive.  The forum reported that the update does not pass and a lot and colorfully tell how and how long they solved this problem.  I am on the advice of the same forum <a href="http://www.networkedmediatank.com/">http://www.networkedmediatank.com</a> preserved - downloaded the application on the flash drive and updated with it. <br>  But enough about surprises, let's look at how the new console looks like. <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  Well, firstly, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DuwlBVPEZEZU">my video</a> .  So it actually looks alive.  This is such a brick of glossy plastic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/711/d51/282/711d512822ee4c0cce6f259313d8bff4.jpg" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/91f/a59/665/91fa596653618fb6ca31d1284320d770.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Aesthetically looks like an amateur, ambiguous impressions.  Especially when you look at the picture.  When you take in hand, like more.  And when you put in an interior under the black TV - it rises like a native.  Again, in contrast to the A-110, the design itself is much friendlier, because  first, the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãblack and does not gleam in the dark, and secondly, the LEDs installed behind the front panel are muffled.  A-110 completely shamelessly shone a red LED in the eyes, strongly distracting from watching the movie, but the A-200 turns on the LED to full only at the moments of rebooting, the rest of the time it is barely warm. <br>  Very much changed the remote.  First, the arrangement of the buttons has changed, but this did not cause rejection.  Apparently, the A-110 remote control was so uncomfortable that I never used it blindly, and when it came to controlling the console, I always lowered my eyes to the buttons.  The new console is more comfortable and I fully believe that someday it will be possible to use it completely blindly.  But while I'm not used to it.  And I watch movies in the dark.  Therefore, a pleasant surprise was that the buttons on the remote have lights. <br><img src="http://img218.imageshack.us/img218/4976/p1010042k.jpg" alt="image"><img src="http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/3839/p1010043pt.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Playing files </h4><br>  In such reviews, as a rule, the largest part is assigned to the enumeration of file formats that the device can play.  Sorry, I have nothing to please you.  Since I got popcorn, I forgot what the format problems are.  Everything that moves is playing, but if you have a suspicion that it will not cheat on any tricky format, you can upload a sample somewhere and I will try to lose and write about the results.  In general, I can‚Äôt say anything interesting for researchers of long lists of audio-video formats in this part.  And for the rest: isn‚Äôt that enough - a complete lack of problems for the year of using the device (I think I can expect the A200 to inherit omnivorous from A110?!?). <br><br><h4>  Networking opportunities </h4><br>  Everything is the same as in A-110 - we can samba, we can nfs, ftp, upnp, torrent-rocking.  Connecting to 100 megabits, there is a ‚Äúsupport‚Äù gigabit, but without tears you can‚Äôt look at <a href="http://www.networkedmediatank.com/wiki/index.php/A-200_Compatibility_Lists">the compatibility sheet</a> , only a handful of routers are supported, and those are not without problems.  There is an opportunity to work on Wi-Fi, for this you need to buy a native dongle, it promises not to work with others.  The previous set-top box played movies from a screw connected to the WL500gP (the NFS export was configured on that, and this ball was added to the network drive in A-110).  But for six months now, instead of the WL500gP, I have a new Linksys WRP400, which, among other things, distributes the phone to the apartment, so no network drives.  Films and music from a computer can be viewed through uPnP. <br>  Of the services I personally use only radio (shoutcast), but in the list of services there are a lot of video and radio, so I think many will find a service to their liking.  I also tested the weather service, Moscow was on the list, it showed the weather.  Add to this, like, nothing. <br>  The news (not entirely unexpected) was the lack of youtube.  Did not agree on something, youtube support removed.  Well, probably, this is not very critical - usability was not very high for this service on A110. <br><br><h4>  A few words about the screw </h4><br>  If possible, choose a 2.5 "screw - significantly reduce the heating of the viscera, and the console will weigh a little bit smaller. By the way, now you need a screwdriver to install the screw. The case is tightened with five cogs - you need to open it and install the screw on the mini-slide another four cogs, which slide in turn, another cog fixed to the base. Be sure to check the <a href="http://www.networkedmediatank.com/wiki/index.php/A-200_Compatibility_Lists">compatibility sheet</a> . <br><br><h4>  Hanging </h4><br>  I get stuck.  They are associated with the work of the torrent rocking.  The forum is trying to understand how this is related to the number of simultaneous downloads, peers and the maximum download / download speeds.  I also believed that hangs slightly depend on these parameters.  The hangs occur at the moment when the download of the torrent is over and verification has begun.  The load on the processor from verification + some network activity (someone is watching a video on the network or continue torrents) and hello.  But!  What is nice, the A200 is quietly reloaded from the console, unlike the A110.  A110 had to constantly click the toggle switch, but in the A200 it simply does not exist.  Press the off button for 4 seconds and the console starts blinking bright LED, indicating that it completes all the processes and goes to the shutter.  After another five seconds, there is complete silence - both the processor cooler and the screw are turned off.  Turning on the prefix after that takes about a minute, which causes criticism of some observers, but I, for one, don't care ... Compared to the A-110, the new prefix is ‚Äã‚Äãstability in the flesh itself. <br>  In general, this is all I wanted to say - you can look at the official specs above or <a href="http://www.popcornhour.com/onlinestore/index.php%3Fpluginoption%3Dproductinfo%26item_id%3D20">on the website</a> , but I tried to uncover the unobvious things that you encounter already opening the box and running to the store for the hard drive, i.e.  spending not very little money. <br><br><h4>  Oh yes, a couple of words about buying </h4><br>  The order is executed directly on the website <a href="http://www.popcornhour.com/">www.popcornhour.com</a> , the purchase is made through Google Checkout, where, accordingly, you need to have an account, for which you need a credit card.  After the purchase is made, Google removes the amount from you (I got 6.966 rubles in rubles with delivery to MO) and gives you a tracking number for the ems tracking number.  Here is my tracking: <br><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Operation </th><th>  date </th><th>  Index </th><th>  Address </th><th>  Attribute surgery </th><th>  Weight, kg.) </th><th>  Announcements  value (rub.) </th><th>  Overlay  payment (rub.) </th><th>  Recipient Index </th><th>  Address of the recipient </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  Export </td><td>  01/29/2010 7:42 PM </td><td></td><td>  Hong Kong HKHKGA </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Import </td><td>  01/31/2010 21:22 </td><td>  104010 </td><td>  Moscow EMS </td><td></td><td>  1.612 </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>  Moscow region </td></tr><tr><td>  Treatment </td><td>  02/08/2010 20:29 </td><td>  104010 </td><td>  Moscow EMS </td><td>  Left the place of international exchange </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Treatment </td><td>  02/10/2010 04:47 </td><td>  130100 </td><td>  Moscow EMS SC </td><td>  Sorting </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Treatment </td><td>  02/10/2010 23:11 </td><td>  141030 </td><td>  Mytischi EMS SC </td><td>  Sorting </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  Handing over </td><td>  02.11.2010 12:00 </td><td>  141030 </td><td>  Mytischi EMS SC </td><td>  Delivery to the addressee </td><td>  1.612 </td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr></tbody></table>  The package was brought straight home. <br><br><h4>  Well, let's sum up </h4><br><h5>  pros </h5><ul><li>  Omnivorous </li><li>  Relative cheapness </li><li>  Significantly increased speed </li><li>  Significantly improved stability </li><li>  Case design </li><li>  New luminous remote </li><li>  Switching off from the console (this, by the way, is a very serious plus - until you use the prefix, you will not appreciate it) </li><li>  Ease of navigation (comparable to a VCR, the wife uses with pleasure) </li></ul><h5>  Minuses </h5><ul><li>  Noise from the regular fan </li><li>  Case design </li><li>  Small stability issues remain (freezes when verifying torrents) </li></ul><br><h4>  Related Links: </h4><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/84518/">Significantly reduce the noise level from the computer in 3 minutes</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/popular_science/73553/">Watch NASA TV on Sybabas set-top boxes (Popcorn, BBK, eGreat, etc.)</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/66460/">BBK PopcornTV NP101S Network Player Review</a> <br><br>  I can not say thank you <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/baxtep2/" class="user_link">baxtep2</a> , who fought and won my natural laziness <br><br>  <b>Update:</b> As requested in the comments, I tested some things: <br>  1. Subtitles in separate files - perfectly reproduces, text size, text color, encoding are adjusted from the console.  If there are several srt files, then you can change the language. <br>  2. Audio tracks in separate files - I did not find how to do it.  I had a movie with a sound track, the name of its file was different from the movie, it‚Äôs logical that it didn‚Äôt catch up.  For another film, I took an ordinary mp-3 track, renamed it, but it still didn‚Äôt catch up.  So, probably, is not able. <br>  3. Explanation of the torrents.  On the console installed rocking <a href="http://www.transmissionbt.com/">Transmission</a> , with all the consequences.  The most important implication is that the rocking chair can be controlled via the web interface.  Go to <a href="http://pch-a200:8077/">http: // pch-a200: 8077</a> , add the torrent file and monitor the status ... <br>  4. Funny buggy - there was no such thing on the A110 (or I had configured something wrong in the A200): if you turn off the TV during video playback, then the sound disappears after switching on.  We have to stop the product and run the file again.  But due to the fact that the prefix automatically puts a bookmark and starts playback from the stop, it is not very annoying.  Yes, and not many people turn off the TV during playback (I just have one year old daughter indulging in this). <br><br>  <b>Update 2:</b> <br>  I tested it on <a href="">this compilation</a> (thanks to <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/brammator/" class="user_link">brammator</a> ).
