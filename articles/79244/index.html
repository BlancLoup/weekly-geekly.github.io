However, only in a single case - if there is a need to print at least something.  If it is lazy to print one photo per month, then not only the CISS is not needed, but the printer itself. <br><br>  The course of my further thoughts was about the following: ‚Äú <i>So, well ... the issue with the camera was decided - for the time being, let the wife master it, while I‚Äôm digging at my leisure.</i>  <i>We will take a picture of at least a child - it is growing by leaps and bounds, memories for life, all things ... and so, all sorts of holidays, party games, meetings.</i>  <i>Store pictures only on your computer, I agree, no matter - good frames and for yourself is not ashamed to print.</i>  <i>People said that in the case of some inks with snpch, pictures could fade in a couple of years - well, there is space on the hard drives for digital originals, if nothing changes, you can reprint it.</i>  <i>Yes, and pictures will be stored most likely in albums - why should they fade) So ... well, photo labs or your own printer with snpch?</i>  <i>So, how much do they have pictures there ... so, delivery is only in the MKAD aisles ... there is a damn expensive here, the office is kind of muddy ... pp, I don‚Äôt want something to drive around on these photo frames - I will buy a printer.</i>  <i>I‚Äôll go broke once, but I‚Äôm going to print until it is blue)</i> . ‚Äù  Similarly, I was mollifying myself to a photo printer) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e2a/e8a/3a6/e2ae8a3a6cd633d37aef8e4ed99781ee.jpg" alt="image">

      Maybe then I would not find a compromise with myself) If it were not for another provocation. <br>  In the first article about snpch I used videos of the company <b><a href="http://www.originalam.net/">InkSystem</a></b> , the person from which later turned to me in ICQ.  ‚Äú <i>Thank you, we wrote interestingly, we can not join the discussion, because</i>  <i>we cannot register, but if there are questions, ask, we will answer</i> . ‚Äù  After a short conversation, I asked them to help with the choice of a really good printer ‚Äúfor home and for myself‚Äù that I could buy and then not bite my elbows.  Invited to visit at any time - after having studied a couple of models with snPC from their range, which I personally liked (in particular, according to reviews on forums and Yandex.market), I went. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb8/217/6b1/bb82176b1ce2791fdcf063343ae20582.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, they immediately said that you need a good printer for good photo printing, i.e.  for a couple of rubles there is no need to look for a solution.  But, to be honest, I didn‚Äôt want to overpay) Like me, there are seriously only two companies - Canon and Epson (well, a little HP) - which I was not particularly surprised by.  After 10 minutes of the educational program, I was offered ‚Äúthis new Epson here‚Äù, which I considered at home as a possible option.  "This" - <b>Espon Stylus Photo T50</b> , model, released this summer.  The technical parameters of this printer are almost the same as those of <b>Epson Stylus Photo R295</b> (it looks like the company just ran out of tsiferki in the R *** series), which was praised literally everywhere - in the articles, on forums, etc. <br><br>  It was also impossible to find differences (neither on <a href="http://bit.ly/8Sn9BU">Yandex.Market</a> , nor on the <a href="http://bit.ly/8IoopA">official site</a> ) and on the model <b>Epson Stylus Photo T59</b> .  Apparently, it differs only in the color of the case (darker than the T50) and the presence of a tiny (10 sheets) stack of 10x15 paper, which turned out to be a very doubtful bonus of the premium version with an overpayment of $ 15. <br><br>  Since the unpacked T50 with the original cartridge (and I only wanted to take it with snrf) was on one of the shelves in the office, I hinted that it would be nice to compare the print quality (since there were still doubts about the results of the work of the CISS) somewhere visually compare like that, I simply could not).  Putting two printers side by side <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D5oy2Y9lG3So">like in a video clip</a> , they printed a photo from my flash drive - there are, of course, differences, but really minimal ones.  More precisely, to say so - seeing only one of the images, you simply do not suspect anything) and given the difference in the cost of printing ... In the end, I did agree to this model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd7/9d9/1b5/cd79d91b5c4a66f79e626ce57fad81ad.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I was surprised by the fact that in the comments many people wrote, they say, it is necessary to spend almost half a day on the installation of the CISS - I had the system installed in just 3 minutes.  You can again be considered for advertising), but the company, apparently, for educational purposes, writes visual clips for installing CISS on almost <a href="http://www.originalam.net/index.php%3Fpage%3Dinstrukcii">every</a> printer <a href="http://www.originalam.net/index.php%3Fpage%3Dinstrukcii">model</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f77/9ea/622/f779ea6229197c9a3dcebba2213cfded.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Regarding my model - I didn‚Äôt have to cut anything with a file - a couple of movements and it‚Äôs ready.  And, importantly, without losing the manufacturer's warranty! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f98/56d/eec/f9856deecc160321dcaacb71d3171551.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11e/a06/706/11ea067064bfe7d81076c43bc4895e25.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, the video itself: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iHsI1Cw-ut0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi8Vkjecj62GZ2lytZj5IG2MmlZ_w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br><br>  In a sufficiently large box (which would be easy to drag, but it would be much easier to take, and in the case of the installed snrf, even more correctly) there were: <br><br>  - <b>Epson Stylus Photo T50</b> printer with a continuous ink supply system installed; <br>  - Ink of 6 colors on 130 ml.  each color; <br>  - 6 "demo" sets of photo paper; <br>  - Die for printing on disks; <br>  - CD with drivers; <br>  - Network wire; <br>  - USB wire; <br>  - Papers. <br><br>  It is logical that to reduce the cost, the original cartridge is excluded from the kit. <br>  Papers - a booklet with a list of original consumables, two warranty cards (from the manufacturer of CISS and Epson) + Quick Start Guide;  There are no instructions in paper form as such, which in my opinion is very bad.  But it is on the disk - made in the form of a detailed color html-directory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/076/2e9/a14/0762e9a14d6a8e3d4d005aef3804ea34.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As for photo paper, I'm confused.  I do not know what should be included, but something must be exactly.  Judging by another review in the internet, there should be 4 demo packs of paper from Epson - Glossy, Premium Glossy, Ultra Glossy and Premium Semigloss.  I also had 6 packs - five packs of 10 sheets each 13x18 (Epson Premium Glossy Photo Paper, 255g / m) and one 10x15 InkSystem Premium Glossy 10x15 (22 sheets).  In short, a total of 72 sheets of glossy paper came out and I'm glad for that) <br>  Vendors also said that in all Epson printers there is no USB-cord - a crisis? <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  It‚Äôs impossible to call the black-and-gray case of the printer compact - it unwittingly took about 1/6 of the desktop surface. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/77f/b64/d8a/77fb64d8accb4b5ae93ee54bb55a08a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nevertheless, the manufacturer tried to somehow optimize its size (at least when it is not in use) - it folds up the paper tray and presses the stand on which the printed paper is placed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71c/907/9a4/71c9079a4df7f17607519f5239bd804a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It can be extended by three retractable sections - it is better not to lean on the resulting structure) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f6/b5c/58a/7f6b5c58a2f13a7ce1c7bfbfbaf445f0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is very pleasant that there is practically no gloss on the case - just a couple of places where the activity of prints will be minimal.  But everything else is either matte or black plastic with a pleasant rough texture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f59/cfc/9e1/f59cfc9e157cb3153e4934a7c2756ce5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the front panel on the left there are three plastic buttons, under which there are dim LEDs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f7e/c9b/922/f7ec9b922bbb0aa7bd83225e929c0921.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The next thing I liked - it does not have an external power adapter.  You should agree that when there are five black ‚Äúcubes‚Äù under the table, which periodically outweigh the line filter ... there is a pleasant little.  Immediately it is easier - one end of the wire is inserted into the outlet, the other immediately into the printer.  For the final connection to the computer you need to connect a USB-cord.  In the instructions for quick installation, everything is written in detail, what and where.  But due to the fact that the printer was tested in the store, I had nothing left but to just turn it on. <br><br><h2>  Training </h2><br>  There were no problems with installing drivers (WinXP) - after five minutes of the installer, there are 3 shortcuts on the desktop.  Epson Easy Photo Print, CD Print And Epson Stylus Photo T50 Manual. <br><br>  The manual deserves a separate praise - although it is made up of porridge from files on the disk, but there are answers, perhaps, to all the questions - all in detail, with color pictures and blackjack), as well as with full localization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3c/2d4/f0d/f3c2d4f0de1341876badf5a195e45638.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To start printing, you need to start one of the programs (well, or print from the program menu, but then many details are not recognized). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/559/f8a/cbe/559f8acbe67fe47328af4b7a9fd755f7.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb9/7be/ca8/cb97beca8cf517b8ea261854b6836b07.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Launch </h2><br>  I hadn‚Äôt tested printers up to this point (although I had a Lexaran <b>Z11</b> staddy ridiculous inkjet and now a <b>Samsung ML-1630</b> laser), so I don‚Äôt plan any tactics) However, I printed something that the printer will print later and share what is. <br><br>  The first thing worth noting is that the printer doesn‚Äôt call a quiet language) or rather, it prints quietly, but here are some preparatory processes before printing that are very loud (the sound resembles old dot-matrix printers) in a room where a small child sleeps, I I did not dare. The same ML1630 prints several times quieter, but even its sound in the conditions of night silence is noticeably noticeable. <br><br>  <b>Printing of documents</b> <br>  Since this is primarily a color printer, I decided to print in it a plain text document containing black text and some color elements. <br>  The first sheet of A4 format appeared somewhere in 15 seconds, the second - after about 5. <br>  The quality of the printed - at the highest level.  When considering the fine details of the text, there are no irregularities in the fonts.  Still does not leave the feeling that the cartridge is not official) <br><br>  <b>Printing Images</b> <br>  For the sake of interest, I printed out a color picture on ordinary office paper (‚ÄúComus Document‚Äù, A4, white, 80g / m). <br>  The result is decent.  A fully populated A4 appeared in about 15 seconds. <br><br><img src="http://bit.ly/5wLCnr" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Printing on photo paper</b> <br>  Since the printer was rewarded with the possibility of photo printing (under which it was, in fact, bought), it‚Äôs a sin not to print a couple of shots.  Still can not accept the idea that you can now print as much as you like) <br><br>  Printed two images - color and black and white.  After reading on the Internet, it turned out that printing black-and-white photos for many printers is a weak point - instead of shades of gray, they often turn blue.  The result was quite a black and white) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/88e/2e6/c51/88e2e6c5106ca4672f83ea8eddbfdeb7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I printed the color image ( <a href="">original</a> ) for comparison with the original on the screen and with the print received in the store.  Immediately I will make a reservation that the comparison was quite incorrect - from the store there was a matte 10x15, and I printed a glossy 13x18. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d9/0fc/34a/0d90fc34a6d888df364a5507c342c64b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Toli photo workshop crap, toli printer is really good) But I liked the glossy print much more.  I do not know how this will be conveyed in the photos in the article, but the differences in real life are obvious.  The printer produced more rosy ‚Äúhuman‚Äù skin colors, while the clarity turned out to be very tall.  Comparing the two pictures, you understand that the money for the first was paid almost in vain, but what to do) On the other hand, I repeat, having only one of the pictures in hand, you will not notice anything terrible.  By the way, the 13x18 photo was printed for exactly 15 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ce/939/58b/8ce93958b79d74078290e48612a782d4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a rumor on the Internet that this printer does not print without borders - it even prints very much.  The main thing to put any type of paper, except for plain (plain paper).  By the way, the printer software allows you to select a lot of different paper profiles - I chose the one that matched the inscription on the stack of photo paper) <br><br>  <b>Print on discs</b> <br>  A nice feature, but not one of the necessary ones. In the metro, I bought a pair of noname-disks, which cost 10p each.  Everything was printed, however, the result was not impressed (it was printed for about 20 seconds) - the colors definitely lack brightness and saturation, although with clarity everything is super. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/90d/1f0/29d/90d1f029d6121317dd2e88c7cec49512.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I tried to play with the settings - the result was not much better.  A search of the forums suggested that there is nothing surprising in this - all noname disks behave in this way.  They advised Verbatim - bought a couple of pieces and here is the result.  In my opinion, this is five, litter for my next face) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7bc/97f/477/7bc97f4777e54e85c55ea1920935a604.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This, of course, does not mean at all that I will now constantly print something on disks ... nevertheless, the very possibility will not be superfluous.  Applications can be found - print carpets on disks in the car, some key photos (or galleries of picas thumbnails) on a photo disk ... or a list of software in small print, backup dates and tagging - whatever.  The main thing is not to lose the ‚Äústand for disks‚Äù) If for backup I use hard disks, then I see the benefit for myself - ‚Äúdecorating‚Äù the disks in the car + occasionally making all kinds of souvenirs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b9a/c25/333/b9ac253332223f0dcc538a7da749974f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the software - for printing on disks it is a separate proprietary program.  There are some ready-made templates; you can create covers for disc boxes;  work with 8 and 12 cm discs is supported, and you can manually set the outer and inner diameters for printing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/08f/953/80a/08f95380a66172b8f10347ac390d684f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  With ease of use there is not everything is as good as we would like (for example, specifying the background of the picture, you can move its fig - only through dialog boxes).  All the standard tools (text, shapes, pictures, etc.) are there, but they are really beautiful to make ... well, maybe it can) When I want to make it really beautiful, I will make the picture itself in Photoshop, and export it to the program only for printing. <br><br><h2>  Check weighing </h2><br>  <u>Pros</u> : <br>  - Non-marking surface, folding trays; <br>  - Functional software and visual informative help; <br>  - Excellent print quality; <br>  - Ability to print on disks; <br>  - Easy to install ciss. <br><br>  <u>Cons</u> : <br>  - Huge size; <br>  - Lack of USB-cord in the kit and documentation in paper form; <br>  - For this price I would like the possibility of offline printing (without the participation of a PC); <br>  - Expensive original cartridges ( <a href="http://bit.ly/6S7aGm">3000r</a> for 6 pieces ?!) <br>  - Noisy in preparation for printing; <br>  - High price. <br><br>  "Naked" <b>Epson Stylus Photo T50</b> with original ink on Yandex costs from 4400 to 6500 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea0/145/122/ea0145122b5610f1ef41d89bade3853a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the InkSystem it <a href="http://www.originalam.net/264.html">cost</a> 4,600 rubles, but since I took it immediately from the CISS (it <a href="http://www.originalam.net/287.html">costs</a> 1799 rubles separately) and a liter of ink, the total cost turned out to be 7,500 r.  As it turned out, there are no problems with the installation of the system (although there are nuances), they installed everything for free.  The original ink, logically, is no longer included in the box, but the bonus is a couple of packs of Epson original paper, the print quality on which I was really pleasantly surprised. <br>  The ink supply, according to the sellers, is enough for 2000-2500 images of size 10x15, which, according to my estimates, could take a couple of years (in the original cartridge the ink volume is 11ml and allows you to print 150-200 photos). <br><br>  According to my estimates, the approximate cost of a print is about 0.2 rubles for ink, with a print format of 10x15 cm. A sheet of photo paper costs from 1 ruble (noname) to 5 (original Epson).  Accordingly, if we take the average ‚Äúpower‚Äù paper, the price of the photo will be approximately equal (or even slightly less) than in the photo workshop.  But you don‚Äôt have to run anywhere and wait for anything - if you don‚Äôt like it, you can immediately reprint, correct it and so on.  If we consider a large format (15x20 or even A4), then the savings increase significantly. <br><br>  Also for this printer there are refillable cartridges (PZK), but the CISS seemed to me more promising and more durable. <br><br><h2>  Sheath Happens </h2><br>  First, when I arrived home, my wife took out a huge pack of photos and said, ‚Äú <i>Do you want to see?</i>  <i>I finally took the pictures out of print</i> ") Just the ones that I planned to print to relatives.  170 matte pictures 10x15 she poured into 700 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57a/03c/14c/57a03c14c889ff6e3b02d0c6b66a01d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Secondly, I‚Äôm not angry with her for it) because I still didn‚Äôt have that amount of photo paper.  But the most unpleasant - I forgot in the company a set of air filters for tanks and instructions.  Figs with her, with a piece of paper (found in the internet), but without filters, as it turned out, you can not print, so I stopped the experiments until I pick up these figovinki.  Now the containers are closed with shipping plugs, which facilitate transportation.  I hope that the next time you need to print a stack of pictures, it will be done at home) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a7e/a2f/855/a7ea2f8558bb0c8a5f3e0fba714059c6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, the question remained photographic paper - on what to print after the demos run out?  Advise pliz.  Since I do not always want to run after her, it is interesting to buy a large pack that would be kept in a closet and spent as needed. <br>  And also - what to do if I need to print something on the disc, but so that the usual surface of the blank is around the printed one, how can I do this? <br><br>  By the way, where did the part of the photo go: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/699/60d/e87/69960de87d427db57ce26560332cf22f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  I think that I was very well helped with the choice of the printer, rather than diluted with money) I am really pleased with the piece of iron, although all these jars and trails with their appearance, of course, kills) <br>  The printer takes up quite a lot of space, but the ability to fold all folding trays turned out to be very useful, as was the lack of an external adapter. <br>  As for print quality, I don‚Äôt know how it is on the original cartridges (nevertheless, one fingerprint for comparison is not an indicator), but I am very pleased with the quality of the picture with CISS, although in the end it plays a minor role.  In a sense, it is much easier to ‚Äúspoil‚Äù a photo with an unsuccessful perspective, framing or primitive processing, rather than a difference in color, which you simply cannot recognize without comparison. <br>  Perhaps you can advise this printer - it seems that he really knows his stuff.  A little expensive, but if you have an interest in the camera, it will pay off pretty quickly.  And professional photographers already know everything;) <br><br>  Share your experience. <br>  <s>I almost put a link to <a href="http://twitter.com/Boomburum">twitter</a></s> <br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79244/</a></p>
