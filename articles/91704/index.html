The requirements for the phone were extremely simple - large buttons and large numbers and letters on the display.  However, no matter how minimal the requests were, there were no models that satisfied them on the market.  If you chose a telephone for your elderly relatives, then you probably came across this. <br>  So when I was offered to take a phone specially designed for seniors for tests, I immediately agreed.  And here before you Just5 CP10. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f2/26/f226a4deec347108333e6cc6f736d54c.jpg"><br><br><habracut><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/a3/a9/a3a96f1a41f837fc88ec9d6246248ee7.jpg">

      CP10 gets to the buyer in a large white box, which informs the owner in large print that he purchased the phone not only with big buttons, but also with a big heart.  It is not known what marketers meant, but you shouldn‚Äôt look for a Snapdragon processor inside the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c9/b5/c9b59750cb63608b45f3b11800dc8890.jpg"><br><br>  Opening the box, we find the device itself, comfortably situated in an orange velvety bed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/db/f4/dbf41a881b0f75396a6415ce67ce39f0.jpg"><br><br>  In the lower compartment stacked charger and headphones.  For the orange charger Just5 special thanks.  Immediately you ask yourself why other manufacturers leave the power supply only the blackest of all colors.  Apparently they never had to unravel the snake coil of power cords.  If they were of different colors, the task would be greatly eased.  Although with the ubiquitous transition to recharge from USB, this is no longer so relevant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b2/c0/b2c0bb86e8999d82a2af25f07fbad7fc.jpg"><br><br>  The instruction, as promised, is printed in huge font and is quite simple and easy to understand.  Perhaps someone even read it.  Although potential users are likely to be instructed by their grandchildren, who will give this phone, and any instruction without need for them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/df/33/df33b2f4f9ef13440d89d06bc72a1fda.jpg"><br><br>  The phone itself turned out quite comfortable and catchy.  And, despite the rounded design, often referred to as "remnant", the device in his hand is tight and comfortable.  The CP10 has not only large buttons, it also has quite impressive dimensions - 107.6 x 50.8 x 17.2 mm, weight - 98 grams.  Pensioners do not follow competitions ‚Äúon the thinnest phone‚Äù, but they will appreciate the catchiness. <br><br>  The build quality is high - there are no squeaks of the case, no backlash of the back cover, all the details fit very closely together.  The materials used for cheap obviously do not apply - rough matte plastic is very pleasant to the touch and does not slip even in wet hands.  Pollution does not stick to the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c2/3c/c23caa67bc7279e04f6eaf09eaf7a69d.jpg"><br><br>  On the front side is a standard set of number keys.  Each button has dimensions of 15 x 12 mm, they are easily pressed even with a thumb, which is rare for modern devices.  The font on the keys is large, easy to read. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/28/1e/281e5e31d642e2095f51c20b67f4531c.jpg"><br><br>  All numeric keys have a bright orange backlight, hang up and receive, as expected, are highlighted in red and green, and the menu buttons are white.  Due to the large size of the digits, some uneven illumination is noticeable, but it does not interfere. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ed/9c/ed9c0dafce454df42d0f7b1893b32107.jpg"><br><br>  The backlight is quite bright and noticeable even in sunlight, which further increases the intelligibility of the characters on the keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/02/49/024989973874d600b7c28239b43d4152.jpg"><br><br>  The screen in CP10 is monochrome with orange backlighting; its physical dimensions are 24.5x37 mm.  The numbers are large and easy to read, the height of the main characters is 13 mm, the lowercase letters in the menu and text messages are 3 mm.  Up to four lines of text can fit on the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/93/bb/93bbcfff4465a4ed8cd5970e9eae45ed.jpg"><br><br>  Rejection of the color screen by the manufacturer is a very reasonable step.  Monochrome displays do not fade in the bright sun, and the information is read without problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/65/88/65889c724cd9034809ca48403b9b3ab3.jpg"><br><br>  On the right edge are the volume keys that conveniently fit under the index finger and the FM radio on button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/75/2b/752b46e4e68550545ed4a9acfa892c62.jpg"><br><br>  On the left - slider switches under the thumb of the right hand.  The bottom one locks the keypad of the phone, the top one includes a built-in flashlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/28/5b/285b430264413edc5df959b18bd3c441.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, the phone has a built-in flashlight!  At the top of the phone is a white LED, which is turned on by the right upper switch.  Have you often had to look for something in the dark with the help of the phone's backlight?  I personally had to do it repeatedly, and I really like this feature in the CP10, although I don‚Äôt have any idea how such a LED would look like, for example, on the HTC Hero. <br><br>  Next to the LED, there is also a thin charger connector and a standard 3.5 mm headset jack, which is attached to the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6a/eb/6aeba9951a1bc8e8e6147de581fb1ec7.jpg"><br><br>  On the back of the case is the battery cover and a large orange "SOS" key.  You can assign a call to the selected subscriber or send a text message.  The function is certainly useful, but it is not implemented very well: the slider is not tight enough, and it can easily switch in your pocket or if you accidentally press it, which by the way is also accompanied by a loud siren. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b0/a8/b0a888145d9ce587df3271812121897d.jpg"><br><br>  Under the back cover is a 1000 mAh Li-Ion battery.  The manufacturer promises up to 8 hours of talk time and up to 200 hours of work in standby mode.  Making minutes for 10 conversations a day, the device will definitely hold out for at least a week without recharging. <br><br>  Under the battery there is a slot for a SIM-card of a not-too-convenient design, it will be difficult for an elderly person to cope with it.  However, this is absolutely not a significant drawback, a SIM-card can be installed in the store or by more dexterous children and grandchildren, who are likely to give them this phone. <br><br>  The menu of the device is extremely concise and clear.  Each item is marked with a large icon with a signature.  Navigating through the menu is done using the keyboard arrows, and the receive and end keys are used to confirm and cancel the selection, respectively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3f/e0/3fe014fe518dbedad2dab1c79c3d2c48.jpg"><br><br>  Localization is good, the Russian language of the phone can be called literary.  Abbreviations in the titles are not used, text that does not fit in the screen is displayed as a running line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/89/90/8990d2d3b69a7bc1d6f1c118cca48a3f.jpg"><br><br>  The quality of communication is good, the volume of conversational dynamics can even be called slightly excessive, so that the older owners will be just right.  The microphone has enough sensitivity, I managed to talk on the CP10 even in the subway. <br><br>  Well, a little overkill - FM radio.  To turn it on, use the switch on the left edge of the phone.  Important note: the radio can work without connecting a headset, while the sensitivity of the tuner is excellent, although at maximum volume the speaker squeals noticeably. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3d/a5/3da56ecdc718f7665a39f082d065aa58.jpg"><br><br>  Due to my age, I cannot objectively evaluate the convenience of this phone for older people, but it seems to me that I should like them.  All requirements are met: the keys are large and brightly lit, the numbers on the display are large, noticeable even on a bright sunny day, and the volume of the conversational speaker is excellent. <br><br>  Significant disadvantages include only the cost.  Still, almost 4,000 rubles for the simplest telephone, the main audience of which is the elderly, are not very well-to-do, people have a considerable amount.  But here it is necessary to take into account that they most likely will not buy the phone themselves, but will receive it as a gift from children and grandchildren, for whom this amount is no longer so significant.  Alas, there are no reasonable alternatives to this model in the domestic market. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91704/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91704/</a></p>
