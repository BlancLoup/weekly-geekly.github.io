      The topic appeared a long time ago and over the centuries it managed to acquire esoteric from all sides.  The terms phase, astral, astral projection, exit, out-of-body travel and out-of-body experience are all about one thing.  The difference is manifested only in the level of awareness.  Unfortunately, for many people this difference is enough to declare that dreams are one and the phase is completely different.  Levels of awareness may vary significantly.  For example, in some cases it is enough only to understand that you are sleeping.  In others, you doubt that it may even be a dream ‚Äî everything that happens is more real than reality itself. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the author has distorted the meaning and neglected the terminology, he should say thank you for the fact that, in practice, at the very beginning, he eliminated the term "astral", which has nothing in common with lucid dreams in their real form. <br><br>  In his post, Mr. <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/leon_3/" class="user_link">Leon_3</a> states that the dream and the phase are not the same.  Moreover, by a lucid dream he understands something preceding the ‚Äúphase‚Äù in quality, which is fundamentally wrong. <br><br>  But what is, in fact, the difference between dreams, phase and astral? <br>  The difference is simple - the last two do not exist.  Both terms are a legacy of esotericism and mean approximately the same, or not the same, depending on the desire of the person using them.  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25C1%25F0%25E8%25F2%25E2%25E0_%25CE%25EA%25EA%25E0%25EC%25E0">That's how simple it is</a> . <br><br><h5>  BDG </h5><br>  And so, there are five phases of sleep. <br>  1 - Falling asleep.  The eyes are closed, and you may not even realize that you are already asleep. <br>  2 - The period of light sleep: relaxation and spontaneous muscle twitches. <br>  3 and 4 - Deep sleep.  Brain activity is minimal. It is very difficult to wake up a person here, and if you succeed, you will not hear anything good from him, if he is able to speak at all, and does not turn off again. <br>  5 - REM sleep or BDG (Fast Motion with Eyes) phase.  It is here that dreams and dreams appear. <br><br>  A complete sleep cycle is approximately 90 minutes. <br><br>  For some unknown reason, the author of the post under discussion replaced the term <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%2594%25D0%2593">BDG</a> , used to designate the phase of fast sleep, with FBS.  [sarcasm] Indeed, let's introduce our own terminology, so it will only be clearer to everyone [/ sarcasm].  The duration of the sleep phase changes during sleep and becomes longer with each sleep cycle, every 90 minutes.  Contrary to the author's statement that the maximum duration of a BDG is 15 minutes, it can stretch much longer, up to half an hour. <br><br><h4>  The practical part - how to do it </h4><br>  The author claims that it is necessary to spend years on mastering dreams, that it is very difficult - it is much easier to enter the phase.  It is a pity that it does not exist. <br>  In other matters, do not be upset, all this complexity is contrived. <br><br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/leon_3/" class="user_link">leon_3</a> cited several techniques for entering a dream, while, unfortunately, did not mention that memorizing dreams is a sufficient condition for self-awareness in a dream.  For this purpose, the diary of dreams is successfully used - just record your dreams and soon you will be able to memorize them without any effort. Meaning - to teach the brain not to forget dreams.  The rest is a matter of technology.  Gradually, going through different situations and highlighting patterns, he will be able to learn how to distinguish between dream and reality.  The amount of time it takes will depend on the particular individual and can vary from a day to several years.  So it‚Äôs really long and difficult?  Not at all, to speed up the process and invented technology.  Also, motivation and enthusiasm are important, with them you can experience the first dream already this night. <br><br><h4>  The most important thing is safety! </h4><br>  <s>Be sure to tie yourself to the sofa.</s> <br>  Lord, keep yourself in hand.  There is absolutely nothing to fear here.  If you do not have mental disorders (otherwise, dreams are contraindicated to you), then it is impossible to ‚Äúget stuck‚Äù in a dream, let alone confuse reality with it. <br><br>  If you are afraid that dreams will negatively affect how well you get enough sleep, then there is nothing to worry about.  The brain will still work with the same force, regardless of whether you are aware that you are sleeping.  The only difference is whether you use this activity or not. <br><br><h5>  Sleep palsy </h5><br>  The only thing you should know about is sleepy paralysis.  By itself, he is not dangerous, but to get stuck in it is not a pleasant experience. <br>  One way out of it - relax and fall asleep.  How would you like to jump and run.  It is worth noting that during paralysis hallucinations may appear - sounds, visions, tactile sensations. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Report</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Someone was walking around my room, out of my sight.  It was scary, I tried to turn around to at least see the shadow. I was lucky that I knew about the possibility of paralysis and managed to make myself fall asleep, not paying attention to what was happening.  Waking up after a minute (the clock was in sight), I realized that the incomprehensible movement was only a vision. </blockquote><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Literature </h4><br>  The author of the post under discussion refused to write a list of references, citing a ban on advertising. <br>  However, I can not leave this part untouched.  In the end, to understand the subject area should be familiar with its fundamental works.  For this reason, I advise you to start with the books of Stephen Laberge, the founder of the scientific approach to the study of lucid dreams.  It should be read first of all, at least in order not to talk nonsense. <br>  As for some other authors, it is necessary to treat them with caution, since many hoaxes are divorced around the topic of lucid dreams. <br><br>  Thanks for attention.  Do not forget to look at your hands. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220527/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220527/</a></p>
