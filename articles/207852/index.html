  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How were pictures of the rise of the Earth</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The famous <b>‚ÄúEarth Rising‚Äù</b> photo (Earthrise, NASA catalog number is AS08-14-2383), and 100 photos that changed the world according to the LIFE magazine catalog, were taken by astronaut William Anders on December 24, 1968 from aboard the Apollo 8 spacecraft when it was performing the fourth orbit around the artificial satellite of the Moon.  This photograph is one of the most famous photographs of the Earth from space. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>As a small digression: the article was written on December 24th on the day of the 45th anniversary of Earthrise, and was a kind of reaction to previous publications, where astronaut William Anders was called the ‚Äúprobable‚Äù author of the famous photo.</i>  <i>There were also inaccuracies that led me to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwriting this article.</i>  <i>The moderation process took a few days, but as soon as the ‚Äúinvite‚Äù arrived, the article was immediately transferred from the ‚Äúdrafts‚Äù to the ‚ÄúAstronautics‚Äù hub.</i> <br><br>  Few people know that AS08-14-2383 was not the first photograph of the Earth, taken in a similar perspective, that is, ascending over the horizon of the moon.  Commander Frank Borman (Frank Frederick Borman), who was in the left commander's seat, managed the spacecraft roll according to the flight plan (180 ¬∞ turn to the right) for a fixed survey of the lunar surface through the left docking porthole with a rigidly fixed 70 mm Hasselblad 500 camera with the 80-mm Zeiss Planar (f / 2.8), which took automatic photographs of the lunar surface at 20-second intervals on a black-and-white film of D ( <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/catalog/70mm/magazine/%3F12">Magazine D</a> ) cassette. <br><br>  Anders, who was near the right-hand chair, photographed the lunar surface through the right side window of the command module on a 70 mm black and white film using a Hasselblad 500EL camera with a 250 mm Zeiss Sonnar lens (f / 5.6), commenting on his observations for recording on-board voice recorder.  The right window, due to a roll turn, was turned just in the direction of the Earth, when the Apollo-8 spacecraft began to emerge from behind the far side of the moon.  Anders was the first astronaut to see the ascending Earth.  Nobody has seen its first three orbits in a circumlunar orbit.  Seeing the Earth, Anders said: ‚ÄúMy God, look at the picture here!  This is the rise of the Earth.  Wow, that's pretty! ‚ÄùBorman saw that Anders was going to take a picture of the Earth, ironically joked:‚Äú Hey, don't do this, this is not according to plan. ‚ÄùShooting the Earth was not part of the plans of the scientists who are developing the scientific program for the Apollo- eight".  After Borman‚Äôs ironic remark, Anders, laughing at the commander‚Äôs joke, took a single snapshot of an ascending Earth (AS08-13-2329) onto an E and <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/catalog/70mm/magazine/%3F13">Magazine E</a> black and white tape:

Give me a tape of color, quickly, please? ‚ÄùHaving supported the idea, he asked:‚Äú Where is she? ‚ÄùAnders hurried him, prompting that the tape was marked with color marking.  Having found one cassette, Lovell noted that this was the ‚ÄúC 368‚Äù film (meaning the color film SO-368, ‚Äúectachro‚Äù from the Eastman Kodak Company).  Anders calmly continued: ‚ÄúAnything.  Quickly. ‚ÄùImmediately after Lovell‚Äôs transfer of the film to Anders, the latter realized that the Earth had left the review of the side window.  At the same time, Anders said: ‚ÄúSo, I think we lost it.‚Äù At this time, due to the rotation of the spacecraft, the Earth could already be observed through the right docking porthole and the porthole of the entrance hatch.  Lovell prompted Anders from where to take a picture.  Anders, asking Lovell to move away, took his famous shot AS08-14-2383 through the porthole of the access hatch: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e0/0d9/d6e/6e00d9d6e4fca527d39b8f28902ed118.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Having refined the focus settings in a small discussion with Lovell, Anders made a second color, less well-known, picture AS08-14-2384, through which the Earth is located above the horizon of the Moon, slightly higher than in the first color photograph, through the right docking porthole: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba5/f0a/4fb/ba5f0a4fba51ad5f5f705ec46da4e329.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Subsequently, 4 more photos of the Earth's rise were made (AS08-14-2385 - AS08-14-2388), and at the next fifth round there were 8 more photos (AS08-14-2389 - AS08-14-2396), but they were not impressive (for example, photo AS08-14-2392): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/037/fb6/af9/037fb6af940c984cade497db3be13e0e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  These 12 pictures were taken through the right docking porthole. <br>  A cassette with color film is available here: <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/catalog/70mm/magazine/%3F14">Magazine B.</a> <br><br>  The land in the pictures looked like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a60/25a/526/a6025a52647aaa8467ba3a20a0f7180b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  - Antarctica was in the left part of the picture (at 10 o'clock); <br>  - the central part of the Earth view was occupied by the Atlantic Ocean with cyclones and anticyclones; <br>  - on the sunlit western part of Africa, along the terminator, from left to right you can see the Namib desert, Namibia, the southern part of Angola and the western part of the Sahara.  These areas are not covered by clouds.  Much of the territory of Central Africa and the historical region of Guinea (including the Gulf of Guinea) is covered with cloud layers. <br><br>  The animation, commented on by the famous historian of the Apollo program Andrew Chaikin (Andrew L. Chaikin) and made in the Scientific Visualization Studio (NASA Goddard Space Flight Center), presents a reconstruction of these events.  The moon is modeled according to high-resolution images taken using the LRO (Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) automatic interplanetary station: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dE-vOscpiNc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj4dgTzFpsitIVT3MHiMhBMExdF6Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Negotiations of astronauts during the photographing of the Earth‚Äôs rise (in English, the indicated time is flight time counted from the moment of launch): <br>  075: 47: 30 Anders: ‚ÄúOh my God, look at that picture over there!  There's the earth comin 'up.  Wow, that is pretty! ‚Äù <br>  075: 47: 37 Borman: (ironically) "Hey, don't take that, it's not scheduled." <br>  Laughing, Anders takes a picture of AS08-13-2329 through the side window <br>  075: 47: 39 Anders: ‚ÄúYou got a color film, Jim?‚Äù <br>  075: 47: 46 Anders: ‚ÄúHand me a roll of color, quick, would you?‚Äù <br>  075: 47: 48 Lovell: ‚ÄúOh man, that's great!  Where is it? " <br>  075: 47: 50 Anders: ‚ÄúHurry.  Quick. " <br>  075: 47: 54 Borman: ‚ÄúGee.‚Äù <br>  075: 47: 55 Lovell: "Down here?" <br>  075: 47: 56 Anders: ‚ÄúJust grab me a color.  A color exterior. " <br>  075: 48: 00 Lovell: (unintelligible) <br>  075: 48: 01 Anders: "Hurry up." <br>  075: 48: 06 Anders: ‚ÄúGot one?‚Äù <br>  075: 48: 08 Lovell: ‚ÄúYeah, I'm lookin 'for one.

(bearing in mind the right docking porthole) Got it? " <br>  075: 48: 41 Anders: ‚ÄúYep.‚Äù <br>  075: 48: 42 Borman: ‚ÄúWell, take several of them.‚Äù <br>  075: 48: 43 Lovell: ‚ÄúTake several, take several of 'em!  Here, give it to me. ‚Äù <br>  075: 48: 44 Anders: "Wait a minute, just keep me down." <br>  075: 48: 47 Borman: ‚ÄúCalm down, Lovell!‚Äù <br>  075: 48: 49 Lovell: ‚ÄúWell I got it right-aw, that's a beautiful shot.‚Äù <br>  075: 48: 54 Lovell: "Two-fifty at f / 11." <br>  Anders takes a picture of AS08-14-2384 through the right docking porthole <br>  075: 49: 07 Anders: ‚ÄúOkay.‚Äù <br>  075: 49: 08 Lovell: "Now vary-vary the exposure a little bit." <br>  075: 49: 09 Anders: ‚ÄúI did.  I took twoo of 'em here.
