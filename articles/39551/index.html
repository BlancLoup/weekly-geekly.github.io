They were replaced by power officials at the top, and a host of managers at the bottom.

      We spend time and effort, but rarely can we see the result of the work, and even that is lost even on the scale of a 1.5 inch mobile phone screen.  If at some point we stop working, it seems that nothing will happen, will not change, and no one will notice.  We do not produce something real, we create mythical added value, we destroy tons of paper and generate terabytes of traffic. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Chronic fatigue syndrome, uninterrupted stress and doom to put up with crumbling and tyranny of the authorities drive us into depression and develop unhealthy pofigizm as a basic reaction to the surrounding reality. <br><br>  Of us, the units work ‚Äúby profile‚Äù, and even those who have been rendered an academic education that is hopelessly far from the practice from the institute.  Nobody taught us to arrange and write a piece of paper correctly, to make a presentation properly, to find something necessary in a bottomless network, or just to work adequately with email clients. <br><br>  Do not teach this at work.  In the best case, colleagues will sympathize and will suggest something on occasion, if they themselves are able.  At worst, it turns out ‚ÄúWhat are you asking?  Do, come on!  No matter how! ‚ÄùAnd as it turns out, of course. <br><br>  Information technologies have become the imposed habitat of any today's manager, but the environment is deliberately hostile, creating problems that have to be solved in order to do something at work.  And the system administrators, if they exist at all, adhere to the principles of the urban wardens "to keep and not to let go."  In practice - ‚Äúprohibit and not implement‚Äù.  Nefig here. <br><br>  And we are deprived of even the most important right of any professional - the right to sit down, close our eyes and how we should think about the solution of the task, a reasonable, logical, professional solution. <br><br>  It turns out that we spend time and effort not on work, but on overcoming obviously unnecessary, collateral difficulties.  We hammer their heads.  But the devastation, it is not in the closet, first of all it is in our heads, in our heads. <br><br>  We are of darkness, and darkness, and darkness - and we all have the right to become better, to become professionals, if not thanks, then in spite of. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39551/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39551/</a></p>
