Is the game worth the candle?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  What will be discussed? </h4><br><img src="http://files.linuxsurgut.ru/win2linux.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At the present stage of my professional activity, I deal with the issue of migration of commercial and municipal organizations to free software, more precisely to the part that is guaranteed to fulfill all the tasks of a client.  Thus, I think it would be reasonable to limit this article to the framework of Microsoft software and open source software based on GNU / Linux, and in particular MS Windows / Ubuntu Desktop and MS Office / OpenOffice.org office suite. <br><br>  I think anyone understands that stealing someone else's work is bad, and making it (if it is stolen) is even worse.  But historically, pirated Windows and Office in Our Fatherland is the norm.  At least the lion‚Äôs share of this software outside Moscow Ring Road was acquired (or downloaded) illegally.  Sometimes, management, as a rule, does not fully understand, or does not want to understand the importance of acquiring just legal software.  Those who are ready to ‚Äúlegalize‚Äù immediately immerse into deep hibernation after the invoice is issued.  Of course, there are various programs for renting software, but first of all, it will not make much money on this, and secondly, this is not about it.  :)

    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  Responsibility for illegal software </h4><br>  If you are familiar with art.  146 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, you know very well that criminal liability arises for such ‚Äútricks‚Äù.  In no case do I want to scare anyone with this, I think this post is not the first in which this responsibility is said.  This is just one of the arguments, and no less significant than the high price of software from Microsoft. <br><br><h4>  Set a goal </h4><br>  Today, in the overwhelming majority of cases, within the framework of the issue under consideration, the following current goal is to: Switch to legal (licensed) software as low as possible with lower financial and production costs. <br><br><h4>  What you need to know </h4><ol><li>  What software works in the organization (it works, and not ‚Äúphotoshop with us, to do all kinds of greeting cards for the holidays‚Äù, and vista ultimate is installed, instead of the same business). </li><li>  What kind of hardware is used in the organization (in particular, this trade equipment, various smart cards, win-scanners, etc.). </li><li>  What is the number of ‚Äúwooden‚Äù personnel in the organization (meaning users incapable and / or unwilling to learn to work with new tools). </li></ol><h4>  What is there in finance? </h4><br>  On the website of one of the developers of software that helps smooth the migration process, there is a <a href="http://www.etersoft.ru/content/view/238/262/">calculator</a> to calculate the cost of licenses.  For example *, you can consider a small enterprise with 15 workstations, with Windows, Office, 1C, Garant / Consultant at workstations, and a terminal / file server ** installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a1/5dc/25d/1a15dc25d9ba50b8115e5c9f24753e16.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>* If you do not agree with some figures - substitute your own, I think this will not change the essence ...</i> <br><br>  <i>** I would like to say that in this variant the organization‚Äôs connection to the Internet through any router is considered, that is, without a dedicated proxy server or Internet gateway, with them the figure will increase significantly.</i> <br><br><h4>  Solutions </h4><br>  I can identify several correct scenarios. <ul><li>  Organization buy software from Microsoft and the question will be closed. </li><li>  We will implement Linux on the maximum possible number of workstations and servers.  In our example, Linux can be deployed on the entire PC fleet and server. </li></ul><h4>  And what about Linux? </h4><br>  Here it is necessary to note three items of expenditure: the price of implementation (one-time payment for the work of IT specialists and linux-software, which allows the least blood to do everything), staff training (usually an introductory course for 10-12 ac. "Wooden"), and further maintenance of the IT infrastructure. <br><br>  Also, it is necessary to understand that the price of services can be any.  I use only the numbers I work with myself. <br><br>  For the given example there will be approximately the following calculation: <ol><li>  Workplace = 3000 x 15 = 45000 rubles, taking into account an introductory course on Linux for staff. </li><li>  Server (with backup organization) = 6000 rubles. </li><li>  Soft = no more than 7,000 rubles. </li></ol>  In total, the total amount in the invoice will not exceed 58,000 rubles, which is 6 times cheaper than buying solutions from MS.  Moreover, the difference (which is 312,000 rubles!) Can be spent on paying for a one-year maintenance contract for personal computers, servicing personal computers, and even remains on unlimited Internet 512 kbit / s! <br><br><h4>  Production costs </h4><br>  But everything is not always as beautiful as in the translated example.  Often, organizations really need software such as Photoshop, Corel, xCAD, etc. And also many accountants use tax reporting and banking systems via the Internet, which for technical reasons (and for me as religious) cannot work under Linux. <br><br>  Here it is already necessary to choose, either to install a licensed Windows, or to retrain the staff.  But free counterparts of similar programs are negatively perceived by their users, and here they cannot be blamed.  If you move away from MS Office towards OpenOffice.org, the task is rather trivial, then mastering the same GIMP is not an easy task (your own experience), and you shouldn‚Äôt organize holivars about this. <br><br>  But as a rule, this situation is the exception that proves the rule. <br><br><h4>  The reasons for the slow progress of Linux </h4><br>  I don‚Äôt know how things are in other cities and regions, but with us (Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug / Surgut) this issue is solved sluggishly, one can even say that it‚Äôs not at all (anyone except me, of course;)) that is not solved.  I see three reasons: <ol><li>  Not everyone wants to legalize software installed in the organization.  This is the ‚Äúpofigism‚Äù of the authorities and its hidden phobias.  One of which is "Who will accompany all this if you are not."  But as you could read above, you can send the proposed difference to the annual purchase of technical support.  And do not think that the support and maintenance of Windows-based systems is required in a smaller volume, in fact the picture here will be exactly the opposite. </li><li>  All the same, specialists in Windows-based systems on the market is incomparably more.  But, sadly, with increasing competition, not only the price of computer servicing and maintenance decreases, but also the quality of these services. </li><li>  Today there are software and hardware solutions that are really required for the organization to work, but they are not compatible with Linux.  And this in turn creates a kind of vicious circle, since  manufacturers of these solutions do not create versions for Linux, due to its low (compared to Windows) prevalence (at least on desktops). </li></ol><h4>  findings </h4><br>  If you are a manager and you do not care for the IT infrastructure of your company (which brings you profit!), You must at least think about the consequences that threaten you if you use illegal software for the needs of your organization.  And if you can not afford the large costs only for licensing software from Microsoft, then you should definitely consider the option of migrating to free software. <br><br>  Behind this say goodbye to you, habraklyudi, see you in the comments!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80958/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80958/</a></p>
