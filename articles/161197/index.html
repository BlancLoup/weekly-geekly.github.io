    <h5>  About the author of the book </h5><br>  Ben Hunt has been involved in web design since 1994.  In the late 1990s, he was the art director of Freeserve, the first mass provider providing free access to the Internet.  He has worked for Poulter Partners, a trademark consulting company, and a youth marketing company Dubit.  As a lead consultant to Scratchmedia, a UK web design consulting company, Ben supported corporations, government agencies and civil society organizations around the world to help them achieve great success with design and usability improvements.  In his blog on webdesignfromscrath.com, he advises and teaches everyone how to create simple and effective website design.  His articles are known to millions of users, and the author himself is considered one of the most influential figures in the field of increasing usability.  In 2007, Ben talked about his philosophy and design methods in his book Save the Pixel - the Art of Simple Web Design. <br><br><h5>  Detailed content of the book with the author's comments </h5><br>  <b>Part I. Design and attendance</b> <br>  The structure of your website is the most important factor in attracting visitors.  The first part of the book shows the mistakes of most sites and offers a new approach to creating sites, which is guaranteed to increase traffic. <br><br>  <i>Chapter 1. How to make a website successful</i> , which describes the typical mistakes of the usual approach to web design and explains why this approach is doomed to poor results.  This chapter presents a new model for creating websites, aimed primarily at potential customers. <br><br>  <i>Chapter 2. Basics of search engine optimization</i> , which shows how search engines work, and what needs to be done to make your site seen by more people. <br><br>  <i>Chapter 3. Expanded coverage</i> , which explains how to change your point of view on the point of view of the client, how to expand the boundaries and increase the impact of site design. <br><br>  <i>Chapter 4. Using the ladder of recognition</i> , which provides a simple but extremely powerful tool for visualizing your customers, referring to groups of potential customers that you have never addressed before, and how to meet their expectations. <br><br>  <i>Chapter 5. Work on the ladder of recognition</i> , which shows eight real concrete examples, and helps to apply the model of ladder of recognition in any marketing task. <br><br>  <b>Part II.</b>  <b>Design and Conversion</b> <br>  It is good to encourage people to visit your site, but do you need simple visitors-viewers?  To find out what makes people choose the answer "yes", I spent two years devoted to tests and research.  Part II will help turn potential customers into real ones by offering techniques, including a simple three-step structure. <br><br>  <i>Chapter 6. Make the site sell</i> , which shows how to simulate the site with the help of conversion funnels, to notice where visitors are lost, and what to do if you find ‚Äúleaks‚Äù. <br><br>  <i>Chapter 7. Attract attention</i> , which offers a set of techniques for creating web pages that attract the attention of visitors and convince them that it is on this site that they will find what they are looking for.  This chapter addresses the basic techniques of graphic design, such as layout, accessibility and visibility, and also gives the necessary advice for composing effective text. <br><br>  <i>Chapter 8. Maintain interest</i> , in which you will learn techniques that keep visitors and encourage them to interact with the site.  You will find answers to the questions, why positive signs are needed, and how to build trust and eliminate doubts, how to detect and exclude the reasons why visitors leave the site.  This chapter also describes how to create web pages that work with people of different psychological types. <br><br>  <i>Chapter 9. Call for action</i> , which emphasizes the critical difference between an entertainment website and a website that promotes sales.  Most sites simply do not cope with how timely and properly ask people to do something.  And it is not surprising that only a small group of visitors goes into action.  Effective calls to action must be worked out.  In this chapter, you will find six tips for creating effective calls to action.  She explains how to create momentum, leading to each call to action, how to get visitors to move from one page to another, and how to get them through the key final mark.  Tips are supported by examples of using texts and graphics for maximum effect. <br><br>  <i>Chapter 10. A website strategy</i> that provides step-by-step instructions on how to use the tricks from this book.  Whether you are creating a new site or working on an existing one, this chapter will help you start moving towards success. <br><br>  <i>Chapter 11. Web Page Optimization</i> , which clearly demonstrates how to check the attractiveness of a website using Website Optimizer, a popular free tool from Google.  I offer you a set of practical solutions to which we have come in an easy way and which we obtained in more than 70 experiments over the past year. <br><br><h5>  Book review by Drayton Bird (Drayton Bird Associates) </h5><br>  Currently, almost every "sensible" business organization has its own website.  Having a website is a conscious need, since almost every person, before spending money, conducts their own marketing research on the Internet.  Unfortunately, most websites are simply not able to accomplish their task - to serve as a source of convenient information, influence or persuade as many people as possible. <br><br>  But even if your site is a happy exception, there will be little confusion from it if almost no one visits it.  Attendance, or rather, its absence - this is the main trouble of the vast majority of sites.  As my former boss David Ogilvy once remarked: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to save souls in an empty church.‚Äù  This book will help you solve "site" problems, and it has several advantages: <br><ul><li>  First, it is written in simple language, unlike other books on similar topics, which, it seems to me, are intended to demonstrate the author's intelligence, and not to provide real assistance to the reader. </li><li>  Secondly, it introduces you step by step with all that you need to know in order to attract visitors to your site, to conclude a greater number of transactions, and all this at a lower cost. </li><li>  Thirdly, this book is full of practical examples, which will greatly facilitate the understanding of the author's intention. </li></ul><br><h5>  Review by Ken McCarthy, the founder of The System Seminar, the organizer of the very first Internet Marketing Conference </h5><br>  Not much time has passed since people confident that the Internet could become a ‚Äúreal‚Äù means of transmitting information could fit at one table.  I say this without exaggeration, because I was one of them.  You cannot even imagine how hard it was in the early 1990s to interest Silicon Valley specialists and representatives of ‚Äúinteractive digital media‚Äù in the commercial potential of the Internet. <br>  And as we can see, today the contribution and influence of the Internet has far surpassed the wildest assumptions of those years.  But there are still a lot of problems. <br><br>  Unlike print, radio, television or any other method of transmitting information, the Internet is a ‚Äútransparent‚Äù media, that is, the creators and ideological inspirers of sites can really see how their developments affect users.  Surprisingly, very few web designers use this simple, but very significant fact. <br>  The main reason for this ‚Äúinattention‚Äù is that no one showed them how to track and test different approaches, and did not explain why. <br><br>  Being engaged in writing this book, Ben Hunt took up the task, which only a few professionals in this field can do.  He managed, having abandoned his ideas on web design, which had been formed over the years of successful work, to look at the problem through the eyes of a beginner. <br><br>  Here is the result of his work - this book, and I can safely say that it is as fascinating as everything that I've seen since Mark Andreessen added a tag for inserting images into HTML.  The fashion for Internet design comes and goes, and this book will become a solid foundation on which you can build your future. <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.piter.com/upload/contents/978545901241/978545901241_p.pdf">Excerpt from the book</a> on the publisher's website (Chapter 9, ‚ÄúCall for Action‚Äù, PDF file) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.piter.com/book.phtml%3F978545901241">Book on piter.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/8821619/">Book on ozon.ru</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161197/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161197/</a></p>
