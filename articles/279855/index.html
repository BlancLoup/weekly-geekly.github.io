Thanks to the introduction of scalable cloud solutions, the use of a large number of sensors and distributed microprocessor systems, breakthrough solutions in such areas as transport, agriculture, industrial production, healthcare, social services and others can be created in the near future.  An increasing number of companies are paying attention to the application of the ideas and technologies of the Internet of Things for the introduction of analytics of their activities and the search for new opportunities for products and services. <br><br>  A significant challenge is the problem of training qualified specialists who are able to create and implement distributed information systems, to apply technical solutions for data analysis and management.  For these purposes, the faculty of "Informatics and control systems" of Moscow State Technical University.  N. Bauman together with IBM and RTSoft decided to create a scientific laboratory of the Internet of Things, which will be opened on March 25, 2016 during the competition of student projects.  On the equipment of the laboratory from March 23 to March 25 at MSTU.  N. Bauman will be <a href="http://e-learning.bmstu.ru/hackathon/">an open student hackathon</a> , to which are invited teams of MSTU and other technical universities. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The final of the competition and the opening of the laboratory will be held on March 25 at 14.00 at the Department of Computer Systems and Networks of MSTU (2nd Baumanskaya St., 5, Main Building, 8th floor, room 805).</b>

      The competition is aimed at promoting advanced information technologies among students of MSTU.  NE Bauman and other technical universities of a wide profile.  Participants in the competition can be full-time students enrolled in both the specialty "Informatics and Computer Engineering", and other engineering specialties.  The main task of the competition is to develop students 'knowledge and skills in applying modern technologies for the rapid development of advanced projects of the Internet of Things, as well as stimulating students' creative, research and inventive activity. <br><br>  As part of the competition, participants will gain knowledge and skills to build distributed software and hardware systems (wireless interfaces, sensors, microcomputers), services and applications of the IBM Bluemix cloud platform (Node-RED, IOT Foundation, dashDB and others), language and technical tools for data analysis ( R, RStudio language), data visualization tools in Web and mobile platforms.  Contestants will have the opportunity to get acquainted with the advanced world experience in building IoT solutions.  There are no special requirements for the participants' skills. <br><br>  Competitive projects should be based on the ideas of the Internet of Things concept, be a distributed software and hardware system consisting of computing devices, sensors and actuators, as well as services and applications in the cloud infrastructure on mobile and wearable platforms. <br><br>  Hackathon will be held from March 23 to March 25, 2016 from 9.30 to 17.00 in the Moscow State Technical University.  N.E.  Bauman, audience 805. For registration, you must send a letter indicating the name of the university to the e-mail of the contest organizers (alexpopov@bmstu.ru, alexander_sorokin@ru.ibm.com, litvinov_pv@rtsoft.msk.ru). <br><br>  More information about the event can be found on the <a href="http://e-learning.bmstu.ru/hackathon/">website hakaton</a> . <br><br>  <b>About the Laboratory of the Internet of Things, MSTU named after NE Bauman</b> .  To support IoT projects at the university, it was necessary to implement a scalable cloud infrastructure, as well as to introduce a number of technologies into the educational process.  The university manages the IT infrastructure by providing limited data center resources to a large number of interested consumers: students and teachers.  For these purposes, cloud solutions based on VMware, VSphere and Xen for servers with x86 architecture, as well as cloud solution xCAT2 for the IBM System z platform are used.  The faculty of "Informatics and Control Systems" has developed a course on the development of IoT solutions on the IBM Bluemix cloud platform, which is popular with students. <br><br>  In addition to the computing infrastructure, an IoT laboratory has the necessary equipment for creating hardware and software solutions.  Each student is provided with a unified box to demonstrate the solution, as well as a set of microprocessor systems (such as Arduino, RaspberryPi, Intel Galileo and others), sensors, wireless interfaces, signal generators, oscilloscopes, power supplies and much more.  Currently, student projects are being implemented. <br><br>  <b>IBM Bluemix</b> is a cloud-based solution for developing and hosting applications aimed at in-depth analytical processing of information and solving complex infrastructure management tasks.  IBM Bluemix is ‚Äã‚Äãbased on open source products and is openly provided to the community of professional developers to quickly create and deploy complex applications that integrate information gathering, analysis, and efficient presentation.  This makes <a href="http://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/">IBM Bluemix an</a> effective tool for translating the concept of the Internet of Things. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279855/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279855/</a></p>
