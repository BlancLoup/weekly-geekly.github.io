The argument with video players and cable is simple: at that time, many viewers could easily do watching movies in cinemas, but it is more convenient to watch porn at home without strangers.  Others <a href="http://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/mobile/194020/the-importance-of-porn">call</a> pornography the main driving force behind the development of global network technologies.  Even before the WWW era, users exchanged <a href="http://asciipr0n.com/pr0n/">ASCII porn</a> , and with the advent of websites, the pornography industry was rapidly mastering online payment technology, broadband Internet, video broadcasting, video chat and virtual reality helmets. <br><br>  In cooperation with the The Next Web site, SimilarWeb conducted a study and <a href="http://thenextweb.com/market-intelligence/2015/03/24/who-are-the-biggest-consumers-of-online-porn/">published the</a> results.  The company's specialists wondered how different nations like to consume pornography, and the findings may surprise, although some may seem expected. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As of February 2015, 4.41 percent of all visits from desktop computers fall on adult sites.  The 2012 ExtremeTech study <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/147330/">found</a> that pornographic websites receive 4.4 billion page views per month.  For comparison: a large forum and social news site Reddit reaches only 2.8 billion impressions.  Adult topics should be the seventh in the list of the most popular categories, falling just under computers and electronics.  Pornographic sites are more popular than such strong categories as games and sports, gambling, beauty and fitness, travel, health and recreation.  Adult sites are two times faster in traffic than the online finance industry. <br><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/903/e3e/bde/903e3ebde79f48f58fb32514a0869d2a.jpg"></a>

      Sites for adults are the fourth category in terms of traffic from banner advertising, trailing behind shopping only by some percentage.  The top lines are gambling sites and video games. <br><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/495/115/f76/495115f7678842edb9e174c9f2abccd9.jpg"></a> <br><br>  According to SimilarWeb, the largest proportion of pornographic websites are in Iraq and Egypt, two fairly conservative countries that could hardly be expected to hit the top twenty.  This is followed by European nations with inclusions of Asian Japan and Latin American Peru. <br><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/503/cf6/014/503cf6014bcd423897da5778c90daa2c.jpg"></a> <br>  <em>Countries with the largest share of adult sites.</em>  <em>As mentioned above, the world average is 4.41%.</em> <br><br>  If we consider the typical time of each of the visits, then the East bypasses the West.  Porn visitors from Middle Eastern and Asian countries lead the time of visit. <br><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/777/49f/a4c/77749fa4ce264110bb688ee171753407.jpg"></a> <br>  <em>Countries with the longest average visit.</em>  <em>World average is 3 minutes 16 seconds.</em> <br><br>  By the number of pages viewed, Europe leads again.  But the first lines are occupied by Hong Kong and its neighbor Singapore. <br><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71c/9ed/40a/71c9ed40a8214b30b304eacea710ad4f.jpg"></a> <br>  <em>Average value of pages viewed per visit.</em>  <em>On average, around the world per visit opens 3.8 pages.</em> <br><br>  Many seasoned pornography lovers <a href="http://www.dailydot.com/technology/bing-porn-search-engine/">recommend</a> using Microsoft Bing to search for porn, rather than the usual Google.  It is believed that in Google some of the results are filtered even with Safe Search disabled / Safe Search, but everything is searched for in Bing.  But if you look at <a href="https://www.netmarketshare.com/search-engine-market-share.aspx%3Fqprid%3D4%26qpcustomd%3D0">other data</a> , it will become clear that when forming pornopros, more often than not, users choose the proven Google. <br><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c3b/3eb/61d/c3b3eb61df0a4354bc6d4f9cd88f9c64.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The theme of the countries with the least share of resources for adults was also touched upon.  It is not surprising that there are mostly deeply religious countries, but there are strange cases - Ukraine, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and Russia, with an indicator of about 3.5%. <br><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/648/846/fc3/648846fc37b141358f186cb05f284f37.jpg"></a> <br>  <em>World average - 4.41%</em> <br><br>  The low proportion of porn sites and the high bounce rate in religious countries can be explained by the fact that the user immediately closes the tab after logging in because of the risky nature of the content on his monitor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b62/833/024/b628330245e5441aaed462e0007c2a77.jpg"><br>  <em>Bounce rate.</em>  <em>Russia reappears among the countries.</em> <br><br>  The time of the visit can be explained in different ways.  Perhaps the user is deeply disgusted with porn resources, and he quickly leaves them, this is a traditional explanation that does not take into account the nature of the content.  It is also likely that the sites completely satisfy the visitor in a short period of time.  The shortest average visit is a little more than two minutes - users from Russia, the list also has Ukraine. <br><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c37/59c/e62/c3759ce6288b4c10b263faf6fdd40abf.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The site <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit.com</a> accounts do not require the input of a real name or email address, anyone can create their own subdit, which he can devote to almost any topic.  It is not surprising that Reddit is leading as a source of adult traffic.  The SimilarWeb study completely features Tumblr, on the pages of which you can find a lot of pornographic blogs.  This happened because each blog subdomain is counted separately.  Among the major sources of porno-traffic, there is also the Russian social networking service VKontakte, which overtakes one of the most popular 4chan forums. <br><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86d/62a/d39/86d62ad3906247e988a0db57a5aa23ef.jpg"></a> <br>  <em>Social media sites by share of outbound traffic</em> <br><br>  The largest share of world pornographic traffic comes from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, and the fifth and sixth lines are shared by France and Russia.  According to the data obtained, we can conclude that, although the United States gives the largest volume of visits, the figures in terms of individual consumers are not as high as it happens with small countries, for example, the United Kingdom.  It is also interesting that visitors from the Middle East can quickly leave the requested pages (probably, these visits are random), but if they still remain, then look at them for a long time. <br><br> <a href="http://https:"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/817/065/894/8170658940484dfa90252b84c6b493d6.jpg"></a> <br>  <em>The main countries, the source of traffic sites for adults</em> <br><br>  Based on <a href="http://thenextweb.com/market-intelligence/2015/03/24/who-are-the-biggest-consumers-of-online-porn/">The Next Web</a> and data from <a href="http://www.similarweb.com/">SimilarWeb</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374821/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374821/</a></p>
