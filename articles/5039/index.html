  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fake blogs make people cynical.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The latest <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a> sensation is the six-minute video ‚ÄúBride Has Massive Hair Wig Out‚Äù.  A few hours before the wedding, the bride rushes into the room with her girlfriends and cries hysterically.  She doesn‚Äôt like her hair so much that she cuts out whole shreds of hair with a scream and a foul language.  The number of views of this ‚Äúamateur‚Äù video approached 3 million when it was <a href="http://www.citynews.ca/news/news_7464.aspx">removed from the YouTube site</a> two weeks after publication (of course, the fans immediately re-uploaded the video to the site). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/W-p2abU02Ak&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgJClW-3LbvcNiOMVXHPWwPMXwARQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The scandal broke out when it became known that the video was shot by a professional film crew, the main character is also a professional actress, and the order was paid for by the manufacturer of shampoos from Sunsilk.  It is interesting that in the video clip there is neither a company logo, nor a bottle with branded shampoo - nothing that could give rise to an idea about the marketing essence of the video.  Yes, this is not necessary.  In the second phase of a marketing company, a company can: <br><br>  a) use the actress from the ‚Äúamateur‚Äù video in the official advertising on TV; <br>  b) use the recognizable slogan ‚Äúwig out‚Äù. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And the second phase is not necessary, because now without any hidden advertising, the public <a href="http://news.google.com/news%3Fq%3DBride%2BHas%2BMassive%2BHair%2BWig%2BOut%26num%3D50%26hl%3Den%26ie%3DUTF-8%26safe%3Doff%26sa%3DG%26scoring%3Dd">only speaks about Sunsilk</a> , that is, the video has already paid for itself. <br><br>  Last year, a <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/column/818/">similar story</a> occurred with the video blog of the ‚Äúlonely girl‚Äù Lonelygirl15, which very religious parents allegedly kept at home and were not allowed to go to school.  In fact, it turned out that a 20-year-old student at an acting institute plays a fictional character, and the Lonelygirl15 project even has a producer.  There was no hidden advertising there, just the actress wanted to get fame and she succeeded - several million people "bought themselves" into deception. <br><br>  Journalists <a href="http://www.canada.com/components/print.aspx%3Fid%3D9e455eb1-bc96-4936-8723-d9b627f4f984">are trying to understand what is happening</a> and what it can lead to.  For the sake of viral marketing, marketers (and not only them) shoot fake videos and deceive the audience.  Recently, even <a href="http://consumerist.com/consumer/alliwantforxmasisapsp/all-i-want-for-xmas-is-a-psp-wins-best-flog-2006-">a fake blogging contest</a> was held - there were a lot of applicants, including the famous <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/column/1154/">journey through America</a> , which, as it turned out, was paid for by the union union of the Wal-Mart supermarket chain.  Two months ago, Technorati's search engine tracked <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/column/2050/">more than 60 blogs</a> on the Web, whose authors purposefully advertise a particular product, without making a note that their opinions were paid for.  Such blogs even had a special designation: <i>phlogs</i> , that is, fake blogs.  Is this a new trend in modern marketing? <br><br>  The main question that arises in connection with this is: how will the attitude of people to such content change?  The answer is quite obvious: the public will become more cynical.  People will trust less network information, especially if there is some hype and hype around it.  In <a href="http://www.canada.com/components/print.aspx%3Fid%3D9e455eb1-bc96-4936-8723-d9b627f4f984">one of the articles on this topic</a> , the opinion of Gillian Watson, a professor of social psychology, is cited.  She says that if everything goes on like this, then soon people will no longer believe in the reality of even real videos on the Internet.  Any more or less interesting content will be perceived with suspicion: would it be worth it for the puppeteers-marketers? <br><br>  People try to resist manipulation and deception.  <a href="http://snopes.com/">Sites created specifically to expose</a> such rumors, legends, and other ‚Äúviral information‚Äù appear on the <a href="http://snopes.com/">Web,</a> which is passed on from mouth to mouth.  In terms of programmer language, marketers are trying to penetrate this information stream with their ‚ÄúTrojans‚Äù, and ‚Äúsocial hackers‚Äù are trying to figure them out by signature and disassemble the code. <br><br>  On the other hand, these ‚Äútruthful‚Äù sites can also be used to introduce some information into the mass consciousness.  In such a situation, no one can be trusted, and critical thinking and healthy cynicism become the main defense for any person. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5039/</a></p>
