And an advertising campaign of such magnitude as that of the new portal Life.ru is an event out of the ordinary.  The cauldron in which twin skyscrapers are cooked with an airplane flying out of the surrounding smoke, a long-legged girl, a Mercedes limousine with a flashing light, a glass of popcorn erupting like a volcano, a classic Fender Stratocaster and a football player who saved the last ball of desperate blow from all this brewing ball - this the picture haunts every passenger of the Moscow metro, a motorist forced to stand in traffic jams on congested highways, every visitor to the largest entertainment sites and a viewer of federal TV channels.  Paying tribute to successfully developing the advertising budget of $ 4 million (the amount is according to <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx%3FDocsID%3D863954">Kommersant</a> ) to the creative group Nevolin, “World of Advertising” and TMK Media, let's see where and why the rest of the $ 8 million invested by the News Media publishing house in this project and implemented “ Interactive Media. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The publishers of the newspapers Life and Your Day remained true to their course of publishing popular and high-quality (as far as this word is applicable to this type of publications) tabloids and their future main asset Life.ru is positioned as a portal of current operational news.  In the whole wide sense of this phrase.  Day after day, a staff of professional journalists will fill the site with "lightning" about the avalanche that has filled tourists, about aggravations in world politics, about traffic accidents involving high state officials, etc. <br><br>  Everyone who wants to complement them in this - millions of camera phone holders, who by the will of fate will be witnesses of one of these events, will be able to upload the “hot” videos they shot to the site.  If the editors decide that this video is worthy of being shown to a wide audience, it will be posted on the news along with other materials.  Moderation at the same time will be soft enough to not accidentally miss socially significant events. <br><br>  The author of the published video will receive a cash reward for each view of his creation.  As its leader <strong>Ashot Gabrelyanov</strong> told at the presentation of the portal last Wednesday, there is already an agreement with VimpelCom, according to which the money earned in this way can be withdrawn to your account by a Beeline subscriber.  According to his estimates, the average price of each national report will be about 30,000 rubles.

      The concept of “people's journalism”, which is now represented as the main highlight of the project, began to develop actively in the West some time ago, both in the framework of small projects of enthusiasts and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/crowdsourcing/6647.html">under the wing of</a> giants of the scale of Yahoo.  Amateur materials are gradually finding their niche.  However, even in the United States, with their incomparably more developed Internet infrastructure and the interest of web users to video materials, this practice has not become something that has changed the whole picture of Internet journalism. <br><br>  In general, in recent days, the RuNet has erupted in criticism of the new portal.  They include: mediocre design, doubtful honesty, ways of attracting an audience that made a website fly to the top of online media attendance ratings in a few days, the emergence of a “family business” in News Media (Ashot Gabrelyanov is the son of the CEO of publishing house Aram Gabrelyanov), bloated budgets and some foggy, unknown by whom noticed parallels with another actively advertised portal - top4top.  Dmitry Dibrov, one of the creators of the latter, by the way, attended the presentation of Life.ru, where he extended a hand of cooperation to Mr. Gabrelyanov.  What exactly he had in mind, however, that evening remained a mystery. <br><br>  However, despite the entire background, the mere fact that investments of such volumes flowed into the RuNet cannot but be encouraging.  In this case, the source of investment looks especially exciting - printed offline media, which invests in transferring its main business to the Network.  You know, if the runet is still lagging behind in the development of the Big Internet, then it is catching up with it at a decent pace! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287488/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287488/</a></p>
