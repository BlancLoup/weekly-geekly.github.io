My first phone, Siemens ME45, served faithfully for 5 years.  Excellent, very convenient device, telephone legend.  Now the ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù does not have such a user community, as it was then at the ‚ÄúMesser‚Äù.  How many cool firmware has been made for it (and Siemens engineers helped, unlike Yabble)!  And the software, in contrast to the "Nokievsky", did not slow down, and there were an order of magnitude less bugs.  GPRS worked fine, I put more than two gigabytes on it. <br><br>  Then he lost the battery, and when traveling to Moscow, even with the Moscow Sims there were some problems - the voice was lost, the interlocutors did not hear me (apparently, it was in some other standards at base stations). <br><br>  As a result, I chose a new phone for a very long time. <a name="habracut"></a>  They became the "Nokia 6233".  But I still do not reach the phone of my dream.  So I decided to describe the phone of my dreams.

      To begin with, let us define that this is a telephone, and not a communicator, an ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù, a telephone player, a telephone digital camera or something like that.  And it is more convenient for me to have a phone + PDA, especially in another city (I use a PDA, without fear of leaving the phone without charge). <br><br><h4>  1. Screen and its backlight </h4><br>  Now, to my regret, they no longer make normal phones with monochrome screens.  All the colors in the sun "go blind", even my "Nokia 6233".  In addition, color screens eat battery.  I would gladly accept a screen like the Nokia 6233 on the PDA.  Excellent viewing angles, colors, etc.  And the sun is not helpless, although black and white is still better.  But on the PDA, I need a color. <br><br>  So the phone of my dream has a clear, contrast, black and white (or with grayscale) screen, possibly based on "electronic ink". <br><br>  The backlight of the screen is pure white, without this pop, inherent in the Korean apparatuses, of blue, from which the eyes hurt.  And uniform.  And changing itself depending on the light. <br><br>  The screen itself should be big.  I really don't like it when there are thick frames around the screen. <br><br><h4>  2. Keyboard </h4><br>  First, it should be.  Must, guys, should.  It's a phone, not a fagot fetish. <br><br>  Since I am not a member of the Yabble fan cult, I am free from the fallacy that all their products are convenient by default.  And therefore I believe my feelings.  I seriously thought about buying an iPhone, long before its official appearance in Russia.  Having tried the iPhone in action, I just made sure that nothing more came up with the keyboard on the phone.  Touchscreen and virtual keyboards - sucks.  Even if they were made in "Yabble".  So, the keyboard on my dream phone should be. <br><br>  Keyboards do not please the current phones either.  Convenience has been sacrificed to appearance.  On my Siemens ME45, the keys were separated from each other.  It didn‚Äôt look very impressive, but the German engineers really took care of the user, and not the way Apple did it, removing the competing email client with the search function that the users didn‚Äôt find necessary. <br><br>  Keys separated from each other allowed male fingers to press them without touching neighboring ones.  That is, due to the empty space, the key became three times larger.  However, you can make at the same time a beautiful and comfortable keyboard. <br><br>  Such a keyboard is in my Nokia 6233, and it was her convenience that played a significant role in my choice.  The keys are large, the letters on them are readable normally, and between the rows there are metal inserts that prevent the simultaneous pressing of keys from below or above from the desired one. <br><br>  And no fucking joysticks that cling and break.  A normal, sufficiently sized 4 or 5-way key is what a male phone needs. <br><br>  Soft keys should be located directly under the screen, not per kilometer.  Their very location should show the correspondence of the key and the soft menu. <br><br>  By the way, with the normal organization of the menu, there is enough of a 4-position key.  The Siemens ME45 is a very convenient 4-position key, the fifth one, in the center, was simply not needed.  It added convenience and reliability. <br><br>  The backlight should be white and uniform, the same as the screen. <br><br>  Keystroke and resistance should impede spontaneous pressing, and the sensation of pressing should be distinct. <br><br><h4>  3. Additional keys </h4><br>  Many phones have a volume control.  Alas, on the "Nokia 6233" it is not particularly convenient.  Keys are almost on the edge.  And they are very close to each other.  And the sensation of pressing is not so clear.  The volume keys should be larger, there should be more distance between them.  And to the touch they must be determined unequivocally.  There was no problem with this in Siemens ME45. <br><br>  Even in Nokia 6233 there is a push-to-talk key, which I don‚Äôt need.  But the bestiality of the Nokia engineers is that they did not allow me to reassign it.  For example, on a voice recorder or voice dialing.  That would be very convenient. <br><br>  In my dream phone, all keys are reassignable.  The side keys should not be close to the end, because in this place the phone receives an emphasis when pressing the side keys on the other side.  Just damn, in the key. <br><br><h4>  4. Wireless interfaces </h4><br>  Bluetooth with a profile for a stereo headset is a must in my dream phone.  WiFi is optional. <br><br><h4>  5. Internet </h4><br>  Sometimes I use a mobile browser.  For example, watch the weather, read the RSS or, more useful, go to the site and see the contacts if I get lost or have forgotten the phone.  Although you can get a PDA, but for such trifles it is more convenient not to get it. <br><br>  Of course, it should be possible to distribute the Internet via Bluetooth to my PDA or laptop.  For business use of the phone is important.  By the way, I still distribute the internet to the laptop via infrared (I have an old faithful Dell S400, who for many years, was with me on duty at the hospital, and it works great, and is also very convenient, for all its flaws , and I will only change it for something more convenient). <br><br>  If I go online with a laptop or PDA, the access should be fast enough.  At least EDGE <br><br><h4>  6. Camera </h4><br>  Here is the camera is not required.  Although, I do not mind its presence, and I use it.  That's what upset me in Nokia 6233, the ugly behavior of the camera.  I don't care how many megapixels are there, but if I take a business card or a book page, the text should be clear.  The camera in Nokia 6233 cannot remove a business card.  The text is simply not read, it infuriates, their mother for the leg! <br><br>  So, if there is a camera on my dream phone, this camera will be able to shoot business cards and text pages.  Even if there are not so many megapixels, as in steep cameraphones. <br><br>  The camera should be located where I do not accidentally close it with my finger.  Closer to the upper edge of the device.  And closed should be durable glass. <br><br><h4>  7. Sound and vibration </h4><br>  Oddly enough, with all my conservatism, I do not mind a good sound.  Now my Nokia 6233 has a good polyphony, but, most importantly, two very loud stereo speakers.  Sometimes I do not feel the vibra, but I hear a sound. <br><br>  Vibra, by the way, at Nokia is normal, and in the phone of my dream it should be no worse. <br><br><h4>  8. Housing </h4><br>  Firstly, it should not be a brick, like ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù or communicators.  This should be a phone case.  Classic candy bar. <br><br>  Secondly, it should not be too thin and flimsy.  Many did not like that Siemens ME45 was too fat.  But to hold this phone in your hand is a pleasure.  "Nokia 6233" is also quite suitable for a man's hand.  Ultra-thin flimsy corps will be left to the Motorola fans, girls and those who consider themselves as such. <br><br>  I would really like a metal phone.  Let him weigh more than 30 grams, to hell with him.  I would rather be weightless phone annoying.  Now my ‚ÄúNokia 6233‚Äù has a steel frame around the perimeter.  And it looks stylish, and already three times in the fall saved the unit.  Not a scratch, by the way. <br><br>  I really do not like vulgar plastmasski, especially such ugly plastic with gloss.  Brushed metal or matte plastic.  Such that prints were not visible. <br><br>  Good hours have good glasses.  "Sapphire", it seems.  Very durable, scratch resistant.  I would like the same on my phone - on top of the screen and on top of the camera.  By the way, the vulgar mirror around the camera - nafig. <br><br>  The battery cover should fit snugly and not push through.  That is, between it and the battery should not be a cavity.  And she should not play.  Like the "Nokia 6233" it has not become loose yet.  For Siemens ME45, it has never become loose in a few years. <br><br><h4>  9. Battery </h4><br>  Of course, the battery must be sufficiently capacious, resistant to frost and it must be charged quickly.  And (apple analysts, prepared to minus) it should be removable, whatever Stifjops would say. <br><br><h4>  10. Ports </h4><br>  On the phone of my dream, charging and connecting to a computer is made via mini-USB.  And the headset can be connected to the same port.  Accordingly, I carry with me one charger and one mini USB cable for all the devices of my dreams :-) <br><br>  If my phone has an infrared port, then I would like to place it on one of the upper corners.  So that it was possible to shine with the ‚Äúbutt‚Äù and put sideways.  Although, in the phone of my dream IrDA is no longer required. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt mind the presence of a microSD slot in my dream phone. <br><br>  In the next part I will talk about the interface, functionality and software of the phone of my dreams, but for now look at my phones. <br><br>  Here is Siemens ME45, the phone legend.  Unkillable, reliable, comfortable male phone: <br><br><img src="http://www.mks-shop.com/estore/db/35000/siemens_me45_safarigr_36850.jpg"><br><br>  Now I have this ‚ÄúNokia 6233‚Äù, in the design of ‚ÄúChampagne Brown‚Äù.  I searched the city for a long time, I barely found it.  It looks really beautiful, stylish and expensive, unlike gray (even the letters on the buttons are not readable) and black (plastic somehow glitters).  Notice that there is a steel frame around the perimeter.  Steel, unlike plastic, glitters nobly. <br><br><img src="http://euroset.ru/f/products/71/533823/nokia-6233-champagne-brown--2.jpg"><br>  Frank Nuovo, the one who worked on the 8800 series and Vertu, also worked on the design of this phone.  Perhaps that is why 6233 turned out to be so restrained, stylish and looks much more expensive than its competitors. <br><br>  Of course, I'm not talking about program and interface issues here.  Maybe I'll write about them next time.  Yes, and so far I do not want a communicator.  I am an adherent of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãtwo devices, with their own batteries and their functions. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/41654/">https://habr.com/ru/post/41654/</a></p>
