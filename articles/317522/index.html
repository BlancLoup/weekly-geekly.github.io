Until we pass the path of trial and error in the development, we will not get closer to a full immersion in the digital world.  It will be so alien and frightening for us, imbued with a poor-quality picture, inconvenient and with sufficient error gadgets. <br><br>  On the other hand, for many, the world of VR / AR is far and incomprehensible, however realistic it may seem.

      However, no matter what, this world will take a certain segment of our life: from games to design, training, simulators for surgeons or aviation. <br><br>  To soften the transition to the virtual world, in addition to creating high-quality full-fledged solutions, there are not enough simple and clear controllers that perform simple and pinpoint tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50f/40c/38a/50f40c38a42c4e7d9178b801c7221d76.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the way to creating gloves for VR, we have identified a simple and uncomplicated product - a clip. <br><br>  The clip from the company Raccoon.world is a gadget that fits on the palm of a person and is responsible for orientation in space for managing virtual hands, objects, programs and equipment. <br><br>  The clip determines the orientation of your hand in space and transmits the corresponding position to the virtual world.  With the help of a clip, you can control various techniques in games and shoot.  It can replace a mouse, joystick or keyboard and can be used in any game, but is best combined with fighting games, arcades, shooters and games with Drag &amp; Drop elements.  You can use one clip on your hand or two clips on both.  The clip is made of materials that do not cause discomfort when putting on the hand and long-term use.  You do not need to squeeze anything in the palm of your hand, as in the case of a joystick, which during a long game sometimes leads to partial numbness and tired fingers.  In addition, the clip can be used with software for design, for example, moving / changing virtual furniture in an apartment if you want to replace an old sofa. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47f/707/76d/47f70776d7e544e89bbea136bda76758.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Hard</b> <br><br>  One of the basic principles of the clip is orientation in space, which is realized by means of the classic MAG, however, unique low-level algorithms are used to maximize the efficiency of the combination of sensors.  Even in such a simplified device, the need to interact with walls and other objects was taken into account, and the foundations of the HTC Vive headset were taken.  It is possible to work with both wired and wireless option.  The estimated weight of the clip is 45 - 70 grams, which is several times lighter than the phone and does not amount to any gravity during its use.  Within a few minutes you will forget about the existence of the clip and will gladly carry out your usual movements.  Indicators located on the clip, will signal a connection / low charge and so on. <br><br>  <b>Soft</b> <br><br>  To date, the clip is integrated with existing games on the PC through the driver.  The team is also working on creating software for mobile VR / AR and is in talks with several studios about ordering full-fledged games and software for mobile platforms, collaborative development and the provision of API / libraries that companies will build into products.  Libraries will be distributed in the public domain and programmers can easily use them to integrate their applications with a phone-phone clip, and get additional features compared to using only VR / AR helmets. <br><br>  The situation with the PC market is slightly different.  After analyzing the market, it was decided that the most correct and reliable option is to write your own driver.  This driver will work in two modes: <br><br>  • Emulation of hid-devices for use in existing games (roughly speaking, they will pretend to be joey with some features); <br>  • For new games, it will say “I am a gadget, I am a clip”, interact at a deeper level and use the full potential. <br><br>  Application areas: <br><br>  • Game industry <br>  • VR / AR <br>  • Manage 3D objects <br>  • PC control <br><br>  At the moment, the team is preparing a campaign on Kickstarter, and besides this: <br><br>  • Conducts testing of the clip by gamers from different countries; <br>  • Provides clips in various game spaces; <br>  • After the Kickstarter campaign, the sale of clips via the Internet is planned. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317522/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317522/</a></p>
