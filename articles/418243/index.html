The presence of these giant bodies, as Kepler said, argues in favor of the incredible power, as well as personal preferences, the almighty creator god.  The gigantic bodies in his view were the stars, accumulated around the Sun, the central body of the Universe of relatively small size, around which a suite of even smaller planets moves in orbits. <br><br>  This strange idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe universe, which Kepler adhered to, was an innovative astronomer, who prepared the ground for Isaac Newton and the onset of modern physics, freed astronomy from the ideal circles of Aristotle and calculated the elliptical nature of the orbital motion, also adhered to several early followers of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA,_%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9">Nicolaus Copernicus</a> and his heliocentric (‚Äú suncentric ‚Äùtheory.  Science insisted on Kepler's theory - observations of stars with high repeatability and careful mathematical analysis of data obtained as a result of these observations.  It was also the Achilles heel of Copernicus‚Äôs theory.  Astronomers, who considered the Earth still located in the center of the Universe, spoke about the absurdity of giant stars, invented by the supporters of Copernicus only so that their favorite theory coincided with the data.  The story of the "giant stars" describing the universe has been forgotten. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d3a/786/0a6/d3a7860a67c184e25966569d8a39c92c.png"><br>  <i>These illustrations demonstrate the Coriolis effect, a force that acts on almost all objects moving on the surface of a rotating sphere.</i>  <i>They were painted by a 17th century Jesuit <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Dechales">Claude Francis Mille Deschails</a> , who used them as an argument against the movement of the Earth.</i>  <i>The illustration to the left shows the F ball falling from the tower.</i>  <i>If the Earth does not move, then the ball simply falls from point F to point G.

      And it is very regrettable.  The story of Kepler and the giant stars illustrates the dynamism inherent in science from its very birth.  It contrasts with the usual stories that tell us about the birth of science, stories describing disputes about the Copernican theory, as those cases where science was suppressed by the powerful, deep-rooted establishment.  Stories about the suppression of science, and not about its dynamism, did not serve the science of good service.  A story about giant stars will be useful to her. <br><br>  Johann Kepler expounded his ideas about giant stars in a book he wrote in 1606 and called " <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Stella_Nova">De Stella Nova</a> ", or "On a New Star."  The book told about a new star, just appeared for a while out of nowhere in the sky in the year 1604.  According to Kepler, the new star eclipsed everyone else, even Sirius, the brightest of all the stars, regularly appearing in the night sky.  In the book, Kepler reflected on the size of the new star, and concluded that its girth is much larger than the size of the orbit of Saturn (the most distant planet known at that time).  Sirius should have been about the same huge, and even the smallest stars, in his opinion, should have been greater than the orbit of the Earth. <br><br>  His stars were generally the size of a universe.  The former head of Kepler, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5,_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE">Tycho Brahe</a> , proposed a theory of the Universe, borrowed from Copernicus, according to which the Earth was stationary in the center of the Universe.  Shortly before his death in 1601, Brahe personified the "great science" of his days - he had a huge observatory, the best tools, many wonderful assistants (such as Kepler), his own publishing, and a lot of money.  In the geocentric (‚Äúearth-centered‚Äù) Brahe model, the Sun, Moon and stars rotated around a stationary Earth, and the planets rotated around the Sun.  The stars were located immediately beyond Saturn, marking the edge of the observable universe.  The sizes assigned by Kepler to the new star and Sirius exceeded the whole Braga universe, while the sizes of the other stars were comparable to this universe. <br><br>  Why did Kepler declare that the size of the stars is comparable to the universe?  Because the data talked about it - at least if his heliocentric theory was correct.  According to this theory, the Earth moved around the Sun in a circle, making a revolution in a year.  Therefore, if at one time of the year she moved towards a certain star, then after six months she moved from this star.  It was possible to expect that some stars will burn brighter in the spring when the Earth approached them, and then become dimmer in the autumn.  This effect is called parallax.  But nobody watched any parallax.  Copernicus explained it this way: the orbit of the Earth will seem like a tiny dot compared to the distances to the stars.  The Earth's orbit was negligible for the stars, and the motion of the Earth could be neglected.  As Copernicus himself wrote, ‚Äúthe fact that there is no such parallax among the fixed stars shows that they are at immeasurable height, in the face of which the circle of the Earth‚Äôs annual motion disappears.‚Äù <br><br>  The problem is a negligible size and a huge distance.  People with good eyesight, looking into the sky, will see the stars in the form of small round dots, with a small but measurable visible size.  Astronomers in the time of Ptolemy in the second century AD, determined that the brightest stars range in size from one-tenth to one-twelfth of the diameter of the moon.  In the book ‚ÄúOn the New Star‚Äù Kepler wrote that bright stars are about ten times smaller than the moon in diameter, and Sirius is slightly larger than them.  The problem is that a star, the apparent size of which is one-tenth the size of the moon, can be ten times smaller than the physical size of the moon in diameter, only if it is at the same distance from us as the moon.  But the stars away from us.  If the star were 10 times farther from the moon, then its real size would coincide with the moon - and it would seem ten times smaller than the moon only because of the distance to it.  If the star were 100 times farther away, its true diameter would be 100 times the size of the moon.  If it were 1000 times farther than the moon, its true size would be 1000 times larger [ <i>probably meant 10 times and 100 times larger, respectively / approx.</i>  ]. <br><br>  And what if this star, whose apparent size is ten times smaller than the moon, would be at such a distance that Copernicus theory requires so that we do not notice parallax?  This star, Kepler claimed, would have been the size of Saturn‚Äôs orbit.  And absolutely all the stars visible in the sky would be no less than the orbit of the Earth.  Even the smallest stars would be several orders of magnitude larger than the sun.  Today, this statement may seem strange to us, since we already know that stars are of different sizes, and if few stars are larger than Earth's orbit (a vivid example of such a star would be <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5">Betelgeuse</a> from Orion), most of the stars are red dwarfs, much smaller than the sun.  However, in the days of Kepler, the question consisted only in simple observation, measurement, and mathematics ‚Äî ordinary scientific matters.  An astronomer of the time, who believed in Copernicus, measurements and mathematics, had to believe that all the stars were huge (we will discuss later what they were wrong about). <br><br>  The argument in favor of the huge stars was so convincing that the details of their measurements did not matter.  Johann Georg Loher and his mentor <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580,_%25D0%25A5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580">Christopher Scheiner will</a> beautifully summarize the problem of giant stars in the astronomical book of 1614 Disquisitiones Mathematicae, or Mathematical Surveys.  They wrote that, according to the Copernican theory, the orbit of the Earth is similar to a point in a universe full of stars;  but stars, having measurable dimensions, are larger than points;  consequently, in the Copernican universe, each star must be greater than the orbit of the Earth, and, naturally, greater than the Sun. <br><br>  Because of the giant stars, Loher and Scheiner rejected the Copernican theory and supported Brahe‚Äôs theory.  This theory coincided with the latest discoveries made with a telescope, for example, with the phases of Venus, which confirmed that it moves around the sun.  According to the theory of Braga, the stars were not located so far away - right behind Saturn.  The astronomer at the time of Kepler, who believed Brahe, measurements and mathematics, was not obliged to believe that the stars are huge.  (Brahe calculated that their sizes varied from large planets to the Sun).  Loher and Scheiner were not alone - for many astronomers, including Brahe himself who studied this problem, the theory of giant stars was something out of the ordinary. <br><br>  But Kepler had no problems with giant stars.  They were for him part of the general structure of the universe;  and Kepler, who saw the ellipses near the orbits and <a href="https://habr.com/post/412233/">regular polyhedra</a> in the organization of the movement of the planets, was always looking around the structure.  For him, the gigantic stars were both an illustration of the power of God and his striving to create a whole universe.  Discussing parts of the universe ‚Äî the stars, the solar system (the system of ‚Äúmovables,‚Äù as Kepler called them), and the Earth ‚Äî the text of the book On the New Star becomes almost poetic, even in translation. <br><br>  Other followers of Copernicus shared the views of Kepler.  People like <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581,_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581">Thomas Digges</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25A5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584">Christoph Rothman</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3,_%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BF">Philip Lansberg</a> talked about giant stars as an example of divine power, as a divine palace, or angelic palace, or even as warriors of God.  Copernicus himself mentioned the power of God, discussing great distances to the stars, noting "how extremely accurate is the divine work of the greatest and best of artists." <br><br>  But opponents of Copernicus did not lose their point of view.  Loher and Scheiner noted that the Copernican "sycophants" did not deny the fact that the stars in the Copernican universe must be gigantic.  ‚ÄúInstead,‚Äù wrote these two astronomers, ‚Äúthey spread about how, based on this, everyone can better feel the greatness of the Creator,‚Äù and called this idea ‚Äúridiculous.‚Äù  One opponent of Copernicus, the astronomer <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D1%2587%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8_%25D0%2591%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">Giovanni Battista Riccioli</a> , wrote that calling upon divine power to support the theory "cannot satisfy more intelligent people."  Another one, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cr%25C3%25BCger">Peter Kruger</a> , commented on the size of the stars: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand how the Pythagorean or Copernican system of the universe can survive.‚Äù <br><br>  Opponents of Copernicus did not just deny his theories.  Loher and Scheiner reported on their discoveries.  They encouraged astronomers to engage in systematic observations with telescopes in order to use the eclipses of Jupiter‚Äôs moons to measure the distance to Jupiter, and the ‚Äúfollowers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãof Saturn (then they did not understand that these were rings) to study its movement.  They worked on explaining how the Earth can move around the Sun: constantly falling on it, just like an iron core can constantly fall on Earth.  (This idea appeared several decades before the birth of Newton, which could give us a modern explanation of how orbit is a type of fall, and illustrate orbits using the example of a cannon firing from a mountain).  They also investigated the question of how the rotation of the Earth can affect the trajectories of falling bodies and shells.  During the 17th century, such an adversary of Copernicus, as Richcioli, worked through this idea, putting forward a theory about the effect that we would call today the ‚ÄúCoriolis force‚Äù (named after the 19th century scientist) and argued that the absence of such an effect also one proof that the earth is not moving. <br><br>  When at school we studied the Copernican Revolution, we did not hear anything about the arguments concerning the size of stars and the Coriolis effect.  We were told where the less scientifically dynamic story in which such scientists as Kepler tried to defeat the omnipotent, ingrained and insubordinate establishment with the help of scientifically correct ideas.  Today, despite the progress of technology and knowledge, science is rejected by people who claim that it suffers from hoaxes, conspiracies, and a lack of data that is caused by a powerful establishment. <br><br>  But the history of the Copernican revolution demonstrates that science from the very beginning was a dynamic process, there were successful and unsuccessful moments in it, moreover, on both debating sides.  Only after a few decades after the appearance of Kepler‚Äôs ‚ÄúAbout the New Star‚Äù and Loher and Shayner‚Äôs Mathematical Surveys, did astronomers begin to find evidence that the dimensions of stars measured by them, both by eye and through telescopes, are exaggerated by the optical effect, and that stars in the Copernican universe did not have to be so huge. <br><br>  If clear discoveries in the customary history of the Copernican revolution confront an omnipotent establishment, it is not surprising that some people expect quick and clear answers and discoveries from science, and they see the hand of secreted influential forces in scientific obscurity.  We would all have more realistic expectations from science if we instead found out that the Copernican revolution contained dynamic mutual concessions, that there were reasonable people on both sides of this process, and that discoveries and progress go unevenly, with hesitation, and sometimes lead to dead ends - such as giant Kepler stars.  When we understand that the simple question of whether the Earth is moving has been a very complex scientific problem for quite a long time, then we will understand that today's scientific questions can give us complex answers, and then only with time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418243/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418243/</a></p>
