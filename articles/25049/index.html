  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The advantages of a large monitor</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recent studies have shown that after people use monitors of large sizes (up to 24 inches), their performance in performing certain tasks has doubled.  But it is when used properly.  In general, the situation has not changed, and in many respects because many have not been able to abandon old habits and continue to use large monitors as small, ignoring their new features. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/910/d98/c5d/910d98c5da1e46a745fe30cb0dbf05f3.jpg" width="450" height="337" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  <strong>1. Fold and unfold</strong> <br><br>  Many users, accustomed to the 17-inch monitor, have a habit of looking at the windows in small windows, without turning the pages to the end.  At the same time, an enormous amount of effort and time is spent on constant scrolling.

      By doing the same on, for example, a 30-inch monitor, you idle use the unused space of the screen. <br><br>  Of course, most applications are designed for smaller monitors and do not benefit from showing them on the big screen.  These are applications with vertical scrolling. <br><br>  But there are still many applications and sites where full deployment opens up new possibilities.  For example, virtual cards. <br><br>  Many people deploy documents to hide the clutter of open applications that distract them from work.  Progress, of course, is there, but by no means positive.  It is much easier, on the contrary, to make the windows smaller and to place them in an orderly manner, so that they help in the work, and not interfere. <br><br>  Unfolding should be used wisely, because in some cases it can interfere.  Another example is text.  Some texts may become completely unreadable with full deployment.  And then the efforts spent on visual perception completely supplant the perception of meaning. <br><br>  Naturally, this does not mean that the complete filling of the screen is ineffective.  But to use the full scan without the need is also stupid. <br><br>  <strong>2. Fill out</strong> <br><br>  Some applications are simply made for widescreen viewing.  For example, Excel.  Fill the entire screen, it will be much more convenient to view the tables if they are displayed all at once. <br><br>  But Word can also be optimized for a large monitor.  For example, one of the advantages is that earlier the offer was often broken into pieces due to narrow borders.  Now you can see the whole sentence, regardless of the font size - it is more convenient for some, for example, when you are creating a site. <br><br>  In addition, you can work with several programs (for example, Word, email, preview articles, etc.) and keep them all open without any inconvenience. <br><br>  Sometimes when reading there are certain inconveniences associated with stretched text, but because of the length we can see a larger fragment. <br><br>  If you work only with Word and nothing else, there are really few benefits.  But, for example, in the new version of Office for OS X, you can use the ‚ÄúView‚Äù folder to change the image settings so that the screen displays as many pages as you need. <br><br>  <strong>3. Rotate</strong> <br><br>  Most widescreen monitors are ‚Äúspread apart‚Äù rather in width than in height, and many documents and files require vertical expansion.  So why should the documents be adapted for the monitor if the monitor can be adapted for the document?  Almost all large format monitors are made in such a way that they can be rotated 90 degrees relative to the screen plane. <br><br>  This solution can be found in many applications, for example, when creating fairly large tables that do not have many columns, rich text, reading and checking large documents, where you need to set the font size that is most convenient for your eyes. <br><br>  Again, when using the monitor horizontally, there are several ‚Äúbuts‚Äù.  For example, along with a change in the scale of a document, your perception also changes, and you can write text longer than you intended;  due to increased comfort.  reading you can read more, and this increases the load on the eyes;  and a shorter piece of text in the vertical position of the monitor, you check more closely than the longer one. <br><br>  <strong>4. Resolution</strong> <br><br>  Often people buy a monitor with a very high resolution, but subsequently remain unhappy with the format.  If you expect to behave as well, better buy a large TV with LCD monitor and VGA or DVI input.  The TV has a lower resolution, and it will cost you less. <br><br>  In addition, ensure that the windows will take up more space on the screen, since each pixel can increase up to 4 times. <br><br>  With a higher resolution monitor, you will be able to perform some operations necessary for the efficiency of your work.  Change without degrading the image scale, menu font, desktop and documents, font size when working with code editors and web browsers.  In addition, improved image quality allows you to increase the distance between the monitor and the eyes. <br><br>  <strong>5. Change parameters</strong> <br><br>  If you are unable to efficiently use the monitor workspace, consider that you could reduce the size and number of windows by adjusting the resolution.  By setting a lower resolution, you automatically reduce the documents to such an extent that they can fit on the screen. <br><br>  <strong>6. View simultaneously</strong> <br><br>  Do not endlessly fold and deploy applications, if you just can put them side by side, even if a little overlap.  Then you can switch back and forth without using the toolbar. <br><br>  Of course, withdrawing from a small monitor takes some time and requires desire.  But this is for your own productivity. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.productivity501.com/getting-the-most-from-a-large-monitor/659/">Original article</a> <br>  Translation: <a href="http://selfhacker.ru/">Selfhacker.ru</a> <br>  Photo: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/kiem_tang/">Works *</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25049/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25049/</a></p>
