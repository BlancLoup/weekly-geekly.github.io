The main reason why others can not reach the global network is the high cost of infrastructure. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  If we imagine a traditional communication system, then it is based on a tower transmitting radio signals to users' devices.  In order to establish communications in this way, mobile operators need to create a complex infrastructure, including land rights, equipment, fiber optic cables / microwave communications, and access to power sources.

      When using such a system, connecting to the Internet from people in remote or sparsely populated areas can be financially problematic.  In such regions, there are far fewer potential customers, and in order to reach them, an even more complex infrastructure is required.  The situation is complicated if we take into account the fact that every fifth person is below the poverty line, trying to live on $ 1.25 per day, or even less. <br><br>  Despite the successful connection of more than 90% of the world's population to 2G networks, an increase of this indicator to 100% using traditional approaches seems unlikely in the near future.  In addition, you should pay attention to the fact that the investments of providers in the creation of infrastructure are unlikely to pay off. <br><br>  The Connectivity Lab was created on Facebook to see if we can change this.  We are developing a number of new technologies - including solutions using high-altitude aircraft, satellites, atmospheric optical communication lines [Eng.  free-space optics] and ground installations - in order to speed up the process of connecting disadvantaged and underdeveloped areas to the Network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9f/100/156/b9f1001569264961b4282256426e261c.jpg"><br><br>  We want these technologies to become the foundation upon which telecom operators, government organizations and other institutions can more effectively create and use networks in such regions.  Today we announced the completion of the two most important steps towards the realization of our goal.  At the first stage, the construction of the first full-fledged Aquila model, a high-altitude aircraft with a long duration of flight developed by our specialists in the field of aerospace engineering in the UK, was completed.  Now this model is ready for test flights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58f/0fb/bc9/58f0fbbc9bd5405c87d43ff2d3b08f37.jpg"><br>  Aquila has the same wingspan as the Boeing 737, but weighs a hundred times smaller <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c0/e36/030/8c0e36030ecc4095825dfaadc98b7bfe.jpg"><br>  Engineer in the process of working on a drone Aquila <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67f/a43/847/67fa438474244677b94a97867706f128.jpg"><br>  Work with propeller Aqiula <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d8/8b2/079/2d88b2079625451e83baffa9c74553cd.jpg"><br>  Aquila wings are made from lightweight carbon fiber, which remains flexible until cured, but then becomes stronger than steel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/563/8fe/301/5638fe301d6f40289238fe61c430643f.jpg"><br>  Work with the smallest details <br><br>  In addition to the Aquila aircraft itself, a special design was created, allowing the drone to be airborne for several months.  Aquila is powered by solar energy and, after launch, will provide communication within a radius of 50 kilometers to 90 days, transmitting a signal to those in this area.  Small towers and antennas will receive this signal and convert it to a Wi-Fi or LTE network, to which users can connect using their smartphones and gadgets. <br><br>  To make this possible, it was necessary to make a truly large and very light aircraft.  Aquila has the same wingspan as the Boeing 737, but it weighs 3 times less than an ordinary electric car.  The one-piece wing construction is made of hardened carbon fiber, whose strength is higher than that of steel.  Before curing, the material remains flexible, so that it can be given the desired shape. <br><br>  During the day, Aquila will be at an altitude of 60,000 to 90,000 feet, where the unit will not be exposed to weather conditions and interfere with air traffic.  At this altitude, the air is thin and its density is about 5% of the air density at sea level.  In this regard, as a result of the design, wings with high elongation and a slightly asymmetrical aerodynamic profile were manufactured, thus ensuring optimum aerodynamic quality.  In the afternoon, the drone will fly at a height of 90,000 feet above the ground in order to fully charge its solar panels.  At night, it will drop to 60,000 feet, consuming less power due to the use of the potential energy of gravitational interaction. <br><br>  The communication system is located in the very center of the aircraft - in its fuselage.  Aquila not only does not need to lay fiber optic cable, but also has the ability to upgrade the embedded system to a specific version that meets the requirements of users. <br><br>  Earlier this year, test tests of smaller versions of the aircraft were conducted in the UK.  In the same year, test flights of a full-fledged UAV model should begin. <br><br>  The second important step towards achieving our goal was the successful use of laser communication systems to provide communication between aircraft.  Our experts in the field of optotechnics have designed and tested optical transceivers with a data transfer rate of several tens of gigabytes per second, ahead of modern technologies in terms of indicators by about 10 times.  In addition, our team used technologies developed for Facebook data centers that form the basis of traditional fiber-optic communications.  The resulting bandwidth corresponded to that which can be found in fiber-optic networks: we are the only ones who can transmit data over the air at such a speed.  In the future we will talk about this technology in more detail. <br><br>  We are proud of the successes achieved at this stage.  During these short 14 months, we designed and built an aircraft from scratch, and also made great progress in developing the technologies necessary for transmitting a huge flow of data through the air.  All these are examples of Facebook's professional ethics: act quickly and implement your ideas, even if it is an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa high-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle with a long flight time.  Of course, in order to make our dream come true, a lot of work remains to be done, but I am sure that we have a suitable team that can achieve significant success in fulfilling the Facebook mission to unite the whole world. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RQxXf6MYpzw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiyE26TqXhHSscBQm0jmyPxR2ipCA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294532/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294532/</a></p>
