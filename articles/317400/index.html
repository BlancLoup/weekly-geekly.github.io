They pulled me into the abyss of hopelessness, and every day I sank deeper.  I was not ready to go to a psychologist and started looking for a way out myself. <br><br>  Having decided that I am not alone in this problem, I began to look for an answer in the books.  Having read clever books and articles, I made a list of 100 books to read, which would pull me out of the claws of demons. <br><br>  My patience was enough for six books, after that I threw my list.  After all, it took so much time, but I categorically lacked it.  Although I did not know what to spend it on.

      My corelist was left untouched for a month, then in one of the articles I came across the books recommended for reading and among the ‚Äú100 books everyone should read‚Äù was ‚ÄúFast Reading‚Äù by Peter Camp. <br><br>  Having studied the method proposed by the author, I managed to increase the speed of reading.  With the author, I do not agree with everything, but some methods were useful.  This article will be about the main methods. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Conditions for reading </h1><br>  Two basic conditions for reading: posture and lighting. <br><br>  There is an established opinion that reading in the dark spoils the eyesight - this is true, but the opposite is also true - the bright light strains the eyes. <br><br>  Diffused light from several sources is best for reading.  Check the lighting is simple: <br><br>  <b>Raise your hand 30 centimeters above the book - if the shadow is clear and bright, then there is too much light.</b>  <b>Preferably no shadow.</b> <br><br>  The best posture to read is sitting with your back pressed against the back of the chair. <br><br><h1>  Accelerator reading, which is always with you </h1><br>  Today, you can find a lot of "reading accelerators", but none of them can compare with the hand. <br>  While reading, our eyes continually jerk along the text.  In order to read something you need to stop looking at the word and only then move on to the next one.  The average reading speed is 240 words per minute, i.e.  four words per second. <br><br>  Use your hands when reading.  Pull out your index finger and move while reading along each line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/293/ab1/d90/293ab1d90f6587c61d9ee94ad65e0a00.png"><br>  <i>Illustration from the book: how to use the index finger.</i> <br><br>  When you reach the end of the line - go to the beginning of the next.  It may seem inconvenient, but as soon as you get used to helping yourself with your hand, the reading speed will increase by 10-20%, but this requires training. <br><br>  <i>Note: I was never able to teach myself to read with my hand.</i>  <i>Perhaps because of the use of the reader, but when reading paper books it helps.</i>  <i>Running a book in a store or library and understanding its essence takes about 20 minutes.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But for this you need not only to help yourself with your hand, but also to skip the ‚Äúwater‚Äù in the text.</i> <br><br><h1>  Return by text </h1><br>  Reading, we constantly go back and re-run through the text.  Usually we do it unconsciously, simply out of habit.  Bad habits.  There is still a conscious return on the text - this is when it seems to us that we did not understand the written text.  Then, returning to the desired site, we re-read it and again look for the place where we stopped.  Time is wasted on it. <br><br>  Returning to the text is not the best way to increase reading comprehension, but it works. <br><br>  If you take a ruler and lead it on the line, it will serve as a pointer to the eyes.  The main disadvantage of the ruler is that it selects the entire line, which means we can return to its beginning.  Better use a hand. <br><br><hr><h2>  Understanding and control over the return of the text - an important step to speed reading. </h2><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/062/412/fc5/062412fc55c248ff816b7447369acd34.gif"><br><br><h1>  How to see more than one word at a time </h1><br>  If you read with your eyes at least three words instead of one, the speed will increase three times.  Although it may seem difficult, it is actually easy.  After all, in school we learned to read, first by letter, then by syllable, and then by reading the whole word.  It's all about practice. <br><br>  If you learned to help yourself with your hand while reading, you noticed that they began to return less often in the text.  A good exercise for fixing the result: read a simple book excerpt in three minutes.  Mark and read again for the same three minutes. <br><br>  While reading the passage for the third time, try to move beyond the first mark and mark the next one.  All the same - three minutes.  Repeat the previous paragraph and put a new mark. <br>  This time, in three minutes, read the maximum possible amount of text and mark the fourth mark. <br><br>  Start reading from the fourth mark and read as much as possible, in three minutes.  Count the number of words in passages 1‚Äì2 and 4‚Äì5, compare and make sure that the reading is increased. <br>  Practice will help to consolidate the skill of fast reading and coverage of more than one word. <br><br><h1>  Stop speaking the words </h1><br>  Mental pronunciation of words goes through several stages.  When we first learned to read, we moved our lips without uttering words out loud.  Some have this habit. <br><br>  It's easy to get rid of it: while reading, hold a pencil between your lips, or spike / whistle.  After a few days of practice, the habit will be eradicated. <br><br>  The next stage is the stirring of the larynx, while reading, as during a conversation.  Self-control will help to get rid of this habit. <br><br>  The final stage is the mental utterance of the words read.  Perhaps you do not notice, but most likely do it.  It is useless, and even harmful, to try to unlearn from mental pronunciation.  Most often, if you control it, the understanding of the text will suffer - what was not said in your head is not understood. <br><br>  The effective way is to read faster than you can pronounce in your head.  Even if some words are pronounced, the speed of reading will increase. <br><br>  <i>Exercise: read as quickly as possible, without lingering on difficult words and not returning to the text.</i>  <i>Help yourself with your hand and do not try to unlearn mentally to say what you read.</i>  <i>Just read as quickly as possible.</i>  <i>It is important not to understand the text, but the speed of reading.</i> <br><br>  Through practice, you will be able to unlearn from the mental pronunciation. <br><br><hr><h2>  The key to success in speed reading is constant practice. </h2><hr><br>  Starting to learn fast reading, do not go back to the old way of reading, until you are satisfied with the result.  But even then there will be much to grow. <br><br>  These are basic skills to increase reading speed.  If the information was useful, then in the next article I will describe ways of reading different types of text and tell you about memorization techniques. <br><br><hr>  <i>Source: <a href="http://www.labirint.ru/books/482672/%3Fp%3D21159">Peter Camp.</a></i>  <i><a href="http://www.labirint.ru/books/482672/%3Fp%3D21159">Speed ‚Äã‚Äãreading</a></i> <i><br></i>  <i><s>How to read 8 times faster if demons surrounded you</s></i> <i><br></i>  <i>How to memorize more, reading 8 times faster</i> <br> <a href="https://smartprogress.do/%3Fac%3D459"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/623/b96/75d/623b9675d4be4ad69974a661aae30321.jpg" alt="image"></a>  <abbr title="Referral link">‚òÖ</abbr> <br><hr><br>  Read more of our articles on our blog: <a href="http://smarttalks.club/">SmartTalks</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317400/</a></p>
