  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Promo site for TV channel</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The need to create promotional sites for television projects appeared relatively recently.  Since about 2004, many Russian television channels have begun to fill the Internet with them.  There were both successful and not so ... But this is not about that.  Is it possible to call promo urgent need? <br>  What is a modern <b>television</b> promo site and what are the stages of its creation - the main topic of the article. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Do you know what a ‚Äúpromo‚Äù is? </h3><br>  <i>The main task of creating a promotion site is the direct promotion of a product or service on the Internet, which may be devoted to a company‚Äôs promotion.</i>  On the one hand, everything seems simple!  But with a different concept is very vague and not in all situations it sounds right.  ‚ÄúAdvertising‚Äù, ‚Äúpromotion‚Äù ... it would seem that words are known and understandable to everyone, but the embodiment of the ideas associated with them is not an easy thing. <br><br><h3>  The first acquaintance with the "promo" </h3><br>  The task that they have set for me is to make only the style of the inscription ‚Äú2005‚Äù for the promotional site of the present days of the NTV broadcast network.  At that moment I had no idea what the promo site was, and the meaning of the word ‚Äúpromo‚Äù itself was not clear to me.  But in order not to fall in the eyes of the authorities, I did not begin to clarify the meaning of this term and in a moment I got into the Internet!  After reading the articles on the Internet and looking at examples of various promotions, I didn‚Äôt even more understand what should happen as a result ... The plus was that the design of this site was already heads up and I only had to stylize it under it.  But this, as it turned out, became the main difficulty.  This site looked like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/c32/081/9ba/c320819bac4c7ab9c2b00ce403c92835.jpg" width="450" height="562" alt="NTV" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  After 3 out of 4 weeks allotted for work, the efficiency of my activity was about 1-1.5%.  I did not have a single idea that could be attached to this design.  I did not feel it, I didn‚Äôt agree with him in many respects ... And then I took a desperate attempt - to make the inscription "2005" not within the framework of this design, but in the way I see it.  We can not say that everything was so simple, because  What is ‚Äúpromo‚Äù I really do not understand!  But the efficiency of work has increased significantly.  As a result, 2 days before my work was completed, I got this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/e8b/850/fd2/e8b850fd2b5f0810cb448a9ac8fc31fb.jpg" width="450" height="66" alt="NTV" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  The first surprise - I was not fired!  Secondly, the design of the site itself will be redone !!!  I was saved by the fact that it was very easy to customize the design of the site for the inscription style.  The inscription was absolutely ‚Äúfree‚Äù, light in colors ... The website was made in (!) One and a half weeks, including work on photo sessions with people on the channel.  As a result, on December 5, 2004, an <a href="http://2005.ntv.ru/"><font>NTV-2005</font></a> promotional project appeared on the Internet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/28e/b65/aa7/28eb65aa7d7d37ab2532e01d2f368d19.jpg" width="450" height="806" alt="NTV" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br><h3>  NTV-2005 - the founder of promotional projects on TV </h3><br>  The project turned out really good.  He very well combined information about New Year programs, projects, all the festive "tricks" of the channel.  Also on it were presented the main events, news.  It was not a separate section, this resource was the support of the main site during the New Year holidays.  If the main site was more rigorous and informative, then this one is more festive.  Spectators for him also attracted contests with New Year prizes.  That was a real promo!  As a result, the site has been visited for more than six months.  Now he is one of the examples of good design and still works on the Internet.

    <h3>  "Do not stop" - one of the main credo of promotional projects </h3><br>  The art directors of the channel went even further by proposing to make the <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/corp/downloads/index.jsp%3Fwhat%3DDesktops">first NTV corporate calendar</a> .  In early November, work began on the creation of studios for shooting.  The presenters for each month were chosen very quickly, photo shoots were made and materials were immediately sent to the designers.  For the "Contrast of White" NTV-design has received a <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/corp/about/index.jsp%3Fwhat%3DNtvDesign">large number of awards</a> .  Also, <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/corp/downloads/index.jsp%3Fwhat%3DIco">icons</a> and <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/corp/downloads/index.jsp%3Fwhat%3DWidgets">widgets of</a> NTV were released. <br>  After NTV-2005, a wave of television promo promo has swept the Internet. <br><br><h3>  TV promo today </h3><br>  Each company has different strategies, different approaches to promoting their products.  Yes, it probably should be.  After all, it all depends on your specifics.  Before creating a promotional website or promotion, you need to clearly define which of your company's products is unique and is needed in promotion (promotion).  It‚Äôs not enough to draw up a clear promotion strategy; you need to take into account a lot of nuances: consumers ‚Äôview of your campaign, target audience, unobtrusive advertising ... Let it be better to know less about your promo, than every second person will be sick of his advertising.  The right choice of the target audience will allow you to clearly define the means by which you will convey information to the consumer.  Returning to television, I would like to note that today the sphere is developing at a rapid pace and it is necessary to clearly understand what will be new for the audience.  Changing the grid for holidays or a week in a row is no surprise to anyone who is going with super blockbusters.  Reality shows and interactive projects in general the day before yesterday.  Today's viewers need a channel of his interests, a channel with the presentation of information in a style convenient for him.  I do not want to say by this that it is necessary to open more thematic channels, there are so many of them, only there is no sense from everyone.  The burden lies on the channels with diverse themes of broadcasting.  The channel must clearly know <b>who and when is watching it</b> , and for everyone to do what is interesting to him.  And then promote it.  In my opinion, a good promo site of a TV project, first of all, of course, must completely and completely provide information about it.  But besides this, it is very good when the user is also given the opportunity to find out what's new on the channel, what news is published, etc.  This will free him from having to visit many resources to find out other information.  It is important to make a picture. <br>  Of course, not only websites, but also commercials, brackets, broadcasts, etc.  etc.  The main task of which is to attract the attention of the consumer and stand out.  Competent designers are already expanding the concept of "promo".  So I think soon we will see new means and new approaches to the promotion of television products. <br><br>  <i>The article used the work of Timokhin A.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Shanovic S., Maslov A., Zarubin E., and many NTV-design employees worked on the creation of the NTV-2005 project.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/11356/">https://habr.com/ru/post/11356/</a></p>
