    <h5>  Short biography of Dr. James Gosling </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfe/2d3/998/dfe2d399864007aca1547748861bbba0.png" alt="image" align="left">  In 1977, James graduated from the University of Calgary with a bachelor's degree in computer science, and in 1983 he received a doctorate degree from Carnegie Mellon University.  Thesis topic is ‚ÄúThe Algebraic Manipulation of Constraints‚Äù.  Since 1984, he worked at Sun Microsystems.  In April 2010, he quit Sun Microsystems after being absorbed by Oracle.  As the reason for his departure, Gosling called the ‚Äúpoor attitude of the new leadership to Java developers,‚Äù as well as Oracle‚Äôs intention to lower its salary.  Since March 2011, James Gosling began working at Google.  And at the end of August 2011, a message passed in the news feeds that Gosling left the Internet giant and went to work in a startup, a small firm Liquid Robotics, which is developing robotics for ocean research.  Gosling now holds the position of chief software architect at the same company. <br><br><h5>  Ocean exploration?  Where is Java? </h5><br><img src="http://www.bloomberg.com/image/iKc2vXw5ig6c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://liquidr.com/">Liquid Robotics</a> produce special robots to collect data in the ocean.  Many US research institutes, both public and private, use this equipment for oceanographic research.  The robots themselves (Wave Gliders) are sea automatic vehicles, the size of a surfboard and weigh only 90 kg.  They work on solar batteries.  Transformed sunlight can trigger any amount of on-board electronics and sensors.  These robots are also able to convert the movement of waves into energy.  It turns out just an inexhaustible power source. <br><br><h5>  Why oceans?  Why not space? </h5><br>  Probably, many would agree that at the moment we know a lot about space, but our planet has not been fully studied, especially the ocean.  What gives us further knowledge of the water expanses of our planet?  In fact, very much.  This includes weather forecasting, natural disasters, the study of the impact of the ocean on the climate as a whole, and the discovery of many new species of marine life. <br><br>  According to Gosling, Liquid Robotics is ‚Äúa technically interesting task that could save the world, and is economically viable, and these three things don't come together often.‚Äù <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rTAP0Id4FJU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjaHqCWg2Pe-pXvUanvm9AyE0bVUw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Oceans, oddly enough, little studied.  At present, the cost of collecting data in the ocean is very high.  If you want to go on a long voyage, then only transportation costs and maintenance costs of the ship will be more than $ 100,000 per day!  Even simple buoys, which are used to forecast and monitor the weather, cost about $ 2 million per year ‚Äî starting, transportation, and operation.  What if we could get tons of data from the ocean in a cheaper way?  This is exactly what James Gosling is working on in Liquid Robotics. <br><br><h5>  Liquid Robotics and Wave Glider </h5><br>  Wave Glider is a mobile platform with many sensors.  It consists of an underwater and surface apparatus (hybrid UMV), which are interconnected with a cable. <br><br><img src="http://jelastic.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/screen-shot-2012-08-22-at-11-29-00.png?w=497&amp;h=351" alt="image"><br><br>  Wave Glider uses the differences between the movement of waves under water and on the surface to move: in fact, the conversion of ocean wave energy into forward thrust.  It is noteworthy that the forward movement does not depend on the direction of the wave.  With such a unique system, Wave Glider can have unlimited mileage without additional fuel costs. <br><br>  More in detail with the principle of operation of Wave Glider will help the following video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TSUZbureE0A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjGTeaxQR0LlDD9wQX5M2ie81ieCA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  You can get acquainted with the technical characteristics of robots here: <br><br>  <a href="http://liquidr.com/files/2012/06/Wave-Glider-0612.pdf">liquidr.com/files/2012/06/Wave-Glider-0612.pdf</a> <br><br>  Such a system is very light, simple, specialized, it is also optimized for small floating obstacles.  Each block is individually authenticated, which is very important, since each sample of data from each wave of the airframe can potentially be authenticated differently. <br><br><h5>  Stream telemetry </h5><br>  Streaming telemetry is exactly that part of Gosling‚Äôs project where he uses Jelastic.  When it comes to processing the received telemetry data with Wave Glider, our service comes to the rescue. <br><br>  In his report <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dr95vcr7G5EM%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded">‚ÄúRobots and Water and Whales, Oh My!‚Äù</a> Gosling says that he avoids using any specific API or ISP.  And the reason for this is that with providers such as Amazon, there have already been a number of software-related incidents.  Today Gosling does not use Amazon, GAE, Microsoft Azure, or any other services with special API interfaces for its development. <br><br>  Gosling has created several clusters that can cross providers.  Then I tested three different PaaS solutions, and stopped at Jelastic.  ‚ÄúI really like Jelastic,‚Äù says Gosling.  This is actually a software package that a number of providers use.  This is a complete Java hosting system that provides not a bare Linux machine, but a JavaEE container.  They have a great control panel.  You do not need to go to Linux, install everything, check which version of Linux is compatible with this or another application server and at what time.  Others have taken care of this for you, and it works fine.  I actually built several such clusters, and they can be hosted by different Internet service providers, in different countries, different data centers.  So I agreed with my paranoia about the safety of all data :). ‚Äù <br><br>  It is a great honor for us that Jelastic liked the father of Java and that he intends to use it in the future.  We hope that you will also like our service, try it for free and share your opinion in the comments to this post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150377/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150377/</a></p>
