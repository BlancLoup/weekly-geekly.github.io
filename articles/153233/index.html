  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to become a rich IT specialist - continued from another author</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I will not say that I completely disagree with the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/152995/">article</a> that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/152995/">inspired me</a> , I will not find fault with the interpretation of the terms ‚Äúasset‚Äù and ‚Äúliability‚Äù, after all, we are not in the accounting department.  I'll write only a few lines in confirmation (or, rather, in support) of the position of its author. <br><br><h4>  UPD: How to become a successful IT specialist </h4><br><br>  I hope no one will disagree with the idea that for the sake of a brighter future, you will have to irrevocably say goodbye to ten or more years of carefree life, which will be spent on polishing experience, earning the same assets.  I do not agree with only one thing that requires broad interpretation: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Credit </h4><br>  A loan for an increase in assets may simply be necessary and, in most cases, inevitable.  Let me assume that, as an entrepreneur, I had to buy a car ‚Äúbetter than before‚Äù on credit just to be able to be parked in prominent places near the venue of business meetings with people who represent commercial prospects for me, without serious consequences for the soul and reputation.  For the same purpose, money was spent on an incredibly expensive office instead of the one that could be removed, refusing a couple of cigarettes a month. <br>  Yes Yes.  Ponty still sell.  But I stress: <b>moderate Ponte</b> .  Arriving at a meeting with a partner in 23 years on Gelendvagen, you risk earning the reputation of a father's son, from whom you should not expect anything serious.  That's just in this case, the loan is a bad liability (the terminology of the inspired author, in order to be clear to the reader of the inspired post). <br>  <i>Note: My car has paid off for three years (the loan period itself).</i>

      There is also an important moment, which every respected reader will attribute to the category that corresponds to his personal convictions: <br><br><h4>  Family </h4><br>  The family is such a pleasant liability, in my opinion, which can, if not properly considered, simply drag your business into the Mariana Trench.  Getting a family, you need to know one simple thing - you just need to combine care with your work on growing the Tree of Welfare, and not go to work with your head, saying that everything will change soon.  You will lose both.  You will need to learn this by developing your own time management system.  Like-minded people nod. <br><br>  Well, a few tips from me personally, but invented, most likely not by me.  Just confirmed over the years and my personal experience. <br><br><h4>  Time management </h4><br><ol><li>  Decide what you need this or that social network.  If to hang out - delete the account.  Save from 300 hours per year (almost 2 months of fruitful work with an 8-hour working day).  Well, or try to set aside for your Facebook two hours on Sunday evening.  Nothing to lose. </li><li>  Check email no more than once per hour.  Save on it 50 more hours a year. </li><li>  Remember, you spend 2 hours a day smoking, using 1 cigarette per hour.  700 hours per year.  I did not quit smoking myself, but began to do it less often and only in those moments when it does not distract me from work: at the wheel, for example. </li><li>  Limit phone calls to a minimum.  Learn to formulate concise phrases for conversation.  Free up another 150 hours a year. </li></ol><br><br>  Total we get 1200 hours per year, or 3.5 hours per day of free time.  You can convert it into your own projects, or multiply by the cost of man-hours of your profile specialist and gasp in surprise. <br><br><h4>  Costs </h4><br>  <b>Basic advice:</b> When approaching the checkout in the hypermarket, be sure to remember that in your cart at least 30% of absolutely unnecessary content (if you are not on the list), and another 15% will disappear in the refrigerator and be thrown away.  More than half of shoppers buy an unnecessary product simply because they are hungry (you also drop by the store after work), and caring marketers spray smoked fish, sausages and other goodies from aromatic plants.  Spread out half, multiply by the average bill and the number of such carts per year. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  There is always an opportunity to make time for development and family, there is always an opportunity to find enough money to start your own project (in a reasonable sense).  I succeeded, which I sincerely wish you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153233/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153233/</a></p>
