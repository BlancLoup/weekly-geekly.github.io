Actually, the letter was sent to members of the club. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Further his letter: </h2><br>  Colleagues, good afternoon. <br>  Share who can real (measured) performance indicators (KPI) for IT staff: <br>  In our service the following categories of specialists: <br><ul><li>  Sysadmins </li><li>  Administrative database </li><li>  Technical support (service desk) </li><li>  Engineers </li><li>  Programmers </li><li>  Analysts: ERP-system experts, each in his own business area: production, logistics, finance ... </li></ul><br>  With p.1-4 more or less everything is clear and measurable.  And how to evaluate the work of paragraph 5, and especially 6? <br><br><h2>  My answer: </h2><br><br>  As promised, I answer :) as always, with a little late.

      I see in the ability to make an assessment of efficiency, the subject of my professional activity.  Therefore, this topic is very interesting to me.  Because  Most of the time I have to manage, control, and encourage the work of Programmers and Analysts. <br><br>  Victor, of course, I can‚Äôt, without detailed study, say how to measure the effectiveness of your employees, because  Many questions remain within your company, for example, details of planning and goal setting. <br><br>  I can tell you how I developed a system for controlling and managing the development process for my employees, both local and remote, hundreds and sometimes thousands of kilometers away.  Judging by the increase in my sn and finished products, I can say with confidence that I did it. <br><br>  What I did to create KPI: <br><ul><li>  Found what you can evaluate the effectiveness </li><li>  Understand how to evaluate </li><li>  Made a transparent performance evaluation system in numbers </li></ul><br>  As I suppose, very few people will be interested in my direct experience.  Because  I manage the processes of developing and creating software products and specialize in this.  And then I also plan to develop myself as a specialist in this field.  This is my strong point.  I will describe the general principles that I used to evaluate the activities of my specialists. <br><h3>  How to find a fulcrum for KPI </h3><br>  I defined the purpose of the work of each unit and employee in two aspects: <br><ol><li>  inside the project (if we mean the project activity) </li><li>  in activity (if it is a process, for example, support) </li></ol><br>  It is equally important to determine the results of the activities of specialists.  For this it is enough to answer two questions: <br><ol><li>  What should happen as a result of his work? </li><li>  What should be the process?  (if the process is endless, for example, support) </li></ol><br>  It is also important to understand the time interval control.  For myself, I defined it as a week - 40 hours. <br><h3>  What is the object of control </h3><br><ol><li>  intermediate results, inside iterations </li><li>  achieving and maintaining quality of service </li><li>  increase the number of effective working hours of employees during working hours </li></ol><br><h3>  Control in numbers </h3><br>  As I already wrote, I do not have a general formula and I doubt the ability to compose it.  But it is certainly possible and necessary to withdraw it for any position, including in our field - IT.  I will offer only items for evaluation.  Now the points of the question. <br><h3>  System administrators </h3><br><h4>  Security </h4><br>  can be evaluated by an external, independent agency <br><h4>  Uptime Hours </h4><br>  I mean not only the server, but all the equipment included in the competence of this position and serving business processes.  Such equipment is easily listed.  Hours of work can be counted without problems: for this you already have a lot of money and, if necessary, you can easily create one. <br><h3>  Database administrators </h3><br><h4>  Data Acquisition Rate (Response) </h4><br>  This is a relative figure, it is necessary to consider it depending on the task.  I have it 0.2s <br><h4>  Data update rate - data relevance </h4><br>  Similarly <br><h4>  Data recovery speed </h4><br>  This is the number of hours that an administrator will need to restore the system.  I always consider several scenarios: from losing one disk in a raid to losing a server. <br><h4>  Uninterrupted operation - reliability and safety </h4><br>  similar to system administrator <br><h4>  Technical support, Response speed, Number of solved tasks, to unsolved, Number of tasks that were solved without recourse to other departments, User satisfaction </h4><br>  All these indicators are very individual for companies, because  depend on the distribution of branches, departments and divisions of the company.  Communication capabilities.  And more from the bar set by the management of the company. <br><h3>  Programmers </h3><br><h4>  Security </h4><br>  I will not repeat <br><h4>  Application speed </h4><br>  can easily be measured by tests or a stopwatch, I prefer automatic testing <br><h4>  fault tolerance </h4><br>  Unusually easily measurable, if there is a system for monitoring requirements and bug reports.  I create such systems at the beginning of work on a project or process. <br><h4>  Compliance with the prototype and TZ </h4><br>  To be honest, I did not find numerical methods for estimating this important characteristic.  I was lucky with the tester, he feels great and kicks programmers if something is wrong. <br><h4>  Effective hours </h4><br><ol><li>  This watch is adequately priced when planning activities. </li><li>  How many hours does a programmer have per week, month, year </li></ol><br>  An effective clock is a time that only takes to solve a problem.  When nothing distracts, no one interferes.  Further, correlating this clock with the length of the iteration (in my case it is with the 40-hour work week), one can easily find the causes of the inefficiency of work and influence them. <br><h3>  Analysts </h3><br>  When calculating efficiency, I do not distinguish analysts from programmers, since  in their work there are also tasks, as well as among programmers.  So, you can count effective hours. <br><h2>  Ending </h2><br>  I know and understand companies in which such records are not kept.  My approach was formed under severe restrictions from the main customer - the investor.  I really consider the hours of effective work of my employees and control development processes.  I have my own ‚Äúprogress bar‚Äù of the movement of projects, as well as what I note separately.  I managed to minimize the costs to the account of "raven" employees.  That is, maximum efficiency and awareness when working in a project. <br>  I will study your comments with interest, colleagues.  I am pleased to take part in the creation of a performance evaluation system, since  I see this as one of the important subjects of my professional activity. <br>  What topics need more detailed disclosure in your opinion? <br>  PS: I want to make my blog in the style of "I CIO" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22536/</a></p>
