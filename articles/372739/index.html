  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PocketBook-2016: a review of a new line of 6 readers from the market leader E Ink-readers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We have long been accustomed to the fact that new models of top-end smartphones show us every year.  Notebook manufacturers also update about once every 12 months - immediately after the release of the next line of Intel processors.  The gadgets of most other types are also refreshed once a year, sometimes a little less, sometimes a little more.  Readers - devices for reading electronic books - stand a bit apart.  Due to their specificity and accuracy for one specific task - in fact, the display of literature in digital form - to release new models every year is absolutely meaningless.  Typically, manufacturers "save" innovations for about two years, and only then show the world new models of readers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/768/58c/aa1/76858caa167804ef40c158de03d16d95.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The company <a href="http://www.pocketbook-int.com/ru/store/products%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dspecial%26utm_campaign%3Dpocketbook_line">PocketBook</a> in September 2016, just as part of this very two-year update cycle of the product line, announced at once 6 new readers.  This is the biggest update since 2014.  The scale is really impressive, except for jokes, - other companies show one at a time, a maximum of two rebrand Chinese models, and here at once half a dozen self-developed devices for every taste.  Which, however, is not surprising: PocketBook is a long-term leader and virtually a monopolist of the reader market with a share in Russia of about 70% (as of mid-2016).  You can read more about the situation on the market for pickups, the history of this class of devices and market trends in <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pocketbook/blog/279924/">this post</a> ). <br><br>  Below, I will briefly review each of the new PocketBook products, but for starters, it's worth saying what they have in common. 
      <br>

      <br>
      <b>First</b> , the PocketBook models are absolutely omnivorous (not ‚Äúpractically omnivorous‚Äù, namely ‚ÄúABSOLUTELY omnivorous‚Äù - without ‚Äúpractically‚Äù): they work with the formats PDF, PDF (DRM), EPUB, EPUB (DRM), DJVU, FB2, FB2.ZIP, DOC, DOCX, RTF, PRC, TCR, TXT, CHM, HTM, HTML, MOBI, and ACSM.  That is, virtually any book found on the Internet, the poketbook will open without problems.  I know that advanced guys like to read in FB2, MOBI and a couple more formats.  But I myself know that finding the right book in them is not always possible.  Especially when it comes to something rare and / or old: here's your DJVU, family, and then get out how you want.  The same hit vaunted Amazon Kindle with its short list of formats with DJVU does not work in principle.  There is one more thing.  For example, I presented a 60-year-old mother with a poketbook, who knows what the Internet and e-books are, but she is not aware of the word ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù in the matter of file formats.  It needs to be this way: I downloaded some book from the Web in the first available format, I threw it into the reader, I read.  And so without problems.  In this case, the PocketBook models are absolutely uncontested, and the same Kindle praises are absolutely contraindicated. <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> , PocketBook 2016 readers with Wi-Fi modules have a number of very convenient options for wirelessly downloading books.  In particular, this e-mail, Dropbox and PocketBook Sync.  The first option allows you to send books to the poketbook from the computer by "soap", the second - through the cloud service Dropbox.  That is, I copied the file to the daddy on the computer - and it immediately appeared in the reader, if the latter is connected to the Internet.  PocketBook Sync, in turn, allows you to buy books from the computer‚Äôs BookLand.net store from a computer and immediately ‚Äúdeliver‚Äù them to the reader.  It is really more convenient to choose literature and make purchases from the PC screen, so PocketBook Sync should also be classified as useful chips. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/305/6c6/ae8/3056c6ae84be471f0d924145b43ca220.jpg"></div><br>  <b>Thirdly</b> , in PocketBook very carefully monitor the quality of the software and regularly improve it.  Actually, at one time - about 5 years ago - it was precisely high-quality, thoughtful software and support for the maximum number of formats without having to do the conversion, quickly brought PocketBook to the leading position in the reader segment.  Firmware updates for Pocketbooks come out on average once a month and a half.  Models with Wi-Fi receive updates over the air (just like smartphones), while owners of models without access to the Internet will have to connect the reader to a PC to install the update. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/17b/3ce/330/17b3ce330df3c67ca40426e8ad7885b9.jpg"></div><br>  <b>Fourthly</b> , it is worth noting the wealth of settings and additional applications peculiar to all pokerbooks.  For text, you can customize the font, indents, hyphenation and line spacing, the library can be presented in several forms (from ordinary daddies to a shelf with books).  Text files in a number of top models can be voiced by voice, that is, in fact, ordinary books turn into audiobooks. <br><br>  Finally, in all PocketBook readers there are games (if you‚Äôre tired of reading, you can pass the time behind them), a calendar, dictionaries with the ability to translate words right when reading a book. <br><br>  <b>Fifth</b> , only E Ink screens are used in PocketBook devices and you will not find only the best quality, the so-called ‚Äúrejection‚Äù.  This is an important point, because some small brands do not disdain to take precisely the rejection, after which headlines appear in the news feeds like ‚ÄúReader with E Ink Carta HD for 7,000 rubles !!!‚Äù Well, yes, such a price can be achieved in theory.  In theory.  If we take defective screens from E Ink factories, which normal manufacturers refuse.  Such displays may have, for example, spots.  Or, when you go to a new page, a trace from the previous one will clearly appear on them. <br><br>  Here, in fact, the key benefits poketbukov.  Also to their strengths can be attributed all the properties of screens E Ink (harmless to view, excellent behavior in the sun, efficiency), this can be read in a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/pocketbook/blog/279924/">previous post</a> , to which I once again refer to all.  To sum up all of the above, we can state the following: PocketBook is a long-term leader in the reader market, not only in terms of market share (in Russia, the company is in the TOP-3 in the world), but also in technology and chips.  Such results were achieved largely due to the narrow specialization - in PocketBook they are occupied exclusively with readers and do not inflate efforts to other types of gadgets, which in our time of umbrella brands is rare. <br><br>  Consider the representatives of the new line of PocketBook, launched on the market in the fall of 2016. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/57d/f9f/2ad/57df9f2ad047d9decd77537b1b775c25.jpg"></div><br>  <b>PocketBook 631 Touch HD</b> - the flagship of the new line.  The model received a 6-inch screen with a resolution of 1448 x 1072 pixels.  This is really a lot: usually, with such a diagonal, the resolution is 1024 x 758, or even 800 x 600. Add the most recent version of E Ink - Carta with a 15: 1 contrast ratio (against 12: 1 for the previous generation Pearl) - and we‚Äôll get perfectly clear letters.  The touchscreen in the PocketBook 631 Touch HD is infrared, which made it possible not to use the ‚Äúextra‚Äù capacitive layer.  This also had a positive effect on image quality. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dad/7dd/600/dad7dd600dec85206cef794a4908384b.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PocketBook 631 Touch HD: the uncompromising flagship of the new line.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Option for technomaniacs, those who want the most sophisticated reader with the maximum set of options</font></i> <br><br>  The model has Wi-Fi (which means all the above-listed options for wirelessly downloading books), the ability to turn text files into audiobooks, a music player.  In short, the full stuffing - a more functional reader today, perhaps, does not exist.  Not a single brand - not only in the line of "poketov".  And yes, there is a backlight in PocketBook 631 Touch HD.  Taking this opportunity, let me remind you that the backlight of E Ink displays, which essentially works as a flashlight, does not harm the reader‚Äôs vision - unlike the active backlight of LCD screens of tablets, smartphones, monitors and laptops, where it (the backlight) forms an image. <br><br>  <b>PocketBook 615</b> - the most affordable backlit poketbook.  The backlight significantly expands the horizons of the reader: firstly, it becomes possible to read from it at night.  Secondly, even during the day, thanks to the backlight, it is much more comfortable to read.  So, if the money is not very much, but I want to buy a poketbook and it is illuminated, then you can safely take the PocketBook 615. There is no music in it, the Internet too, but they didn‚Äôt save the display: the model is equipped with an E Ink Pearl HD screen with a resolution of 1024 x 758 (against the base for readers 800 x 600). <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f58/a6a/9f5/f58a6a9f5290f2b88648db1e5c5ea488.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PocketBook 615: the "golden mean" for users who do not seek excesses.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The screen is good, there is a backlight - this is the main thing.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">And without the Internet somehow live</font></i> <br><br>  <b>PocketBook 614 Limited Edition</b> - the most affordable pokebook in the line.  This is a limited edition of the hit model PocketBook 614. Of the innovations - a pleasant in all respects branded cover in the kit and only a white color version (earlier the model was also offered in gray).  Separately, such an accessory can be bought for about 1,000 rubles, and here it comes immediately with a reader for 6,999. In a word, this is an interesting option. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da9/112/d4b/da9112d4bb07d96bdf42820964a21e36.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PocketBook 614 Limited Edition is the most for budget users: not only is the reader inexpensive, so is the case with it.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">That is, do not have to buy it separately</font></i> <br><br>  <b>PocketBook 625 Basic Touch 2</b> is a budget reader with an E Ink Carta screen.  True, the resolution of the latter is just basic: 800 x 600. There is no backlight, but there is Wi-Fi for wirelessly updating the firmware, downloading books ‚Äúover the air‚Äù, and so on.  Who is this poketbook for?  For example, those who do not read at night.  Or those who read at night and who have an external flashlight from the previous reader.  My mother, which I mentioned above, just owns such an accessory, and therefore I handed her not the 615th model, but the 625th one.  Still, the ability to download books via Dropbox is very convenient, let them join the beautiful. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5b/811/26b/c5b81126b93783924811b20c4cf740c2.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PocketBook 625: the last generation screen and the Internet, but without the backlight.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">If you are reading only during the day (well, or you already have a separate flashlight accessory), then you should pay attention to this model.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Except for the backlight, it is more functional than the PocketBook 615</font></i> <br><br>  <b>PocketBook 840 Ink Pad 2</b> - the only large-format (8-inch) reader in the new line.  On the large E Ink Pearl screen with a very high resolution (1600 x 1200), it is very convenient to view documents with an abundance of graphs, charts and tables, so that there will be a large package available.  The deuce in the name says that there was also a model Ink Pad.  Indeed, there was one, and PocketBook 840 Ink Pad 2 differs from it mainly in that the glass now covers only the screen, and not the entire front panel.  Due to this, the glass was made thinner, killing two birds with one stone.  First, the contrast of the image on the display has increased by 20%.  Secondly, the weight of the package dropped by 45 g - from 350 to 305. For a device that you will hold in a bent arm for a long time, this is quite noticeable.  Well, another innovation: a different design of page turning keys.  Now for pressing on them it is necessary to make much less effort. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c64/d05/3c0/c64d053c05bed982ece881b81c3c5567.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PocketBook 840 Ink Pad 2: for those who actively read technical or business letters, since on an 8-inch screen it is more convenient to view all these graphics and tables than on a 6-inch</font></i> <br><br>  <b>PocketBook 626 Plus Ruby Red</b> .  This is not a new model, but a limited edition of the well-known 2014 Pocketbook.  The peculiarity of the novelty is the ruby-red color of the case, which is reflected in the name.  In my opinion, an interesting option: readers are usually available in inconspicuous colors (black, white, brown, gray ...), and in the person of PocketBook 626 Plus Ruby Red we offer something much more cheerful.  A rare chance to buy a bright poketbook. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a1/b2e/fad/0a1b2efadb1620561dcccfa4fd21ed19.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">PocketBook 626 Plus Ruby Red is interesting not only unusual coloring for readers.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">With the functionality of it, too, everything is good: there is a backlight, Wi-Fi, screen E Ink Pearl HD.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">In short, you can choose this ‚Äúunit‚Äù not only for the red case.</font></i> <br><br>  Such is the new line.  There are budget models in it (PocketBook 614 LE, and 625 - 6 999 and 7 999 rubles), and a middle class device (PocketBook 615 - 8 999 rubles), and a flagship with the maximum set of modern technologies (PocketBook 631 Touch HD - 12 499 rubles), a large format for scientists and businessmen (PocketBook 840 Ink Pad - 17 999 rubles), and even a rare exclusive for special connoisseurs (PocketBook 626 Plus Touch Lux 3 Ruby Red - 10 999 rubles).  In my opinion, there are no bottlenecks in the ruler, it covers the requests of almost all users who need reader-readers.  Well, do not forget about the general strengths of PocketBook readers: omnivorous in terms of formats, high-quality screens without "rejection", a lot of settings to fit the device for themselves, advanced Internet functionality. <br><br>  What do you think about the new line?  What would you like to improve in current models of PocketBook and what to see in the future?  Ask questions in the comments, we with representatives of PocketBook will be happy to answer them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372739/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372739/</a></p>
