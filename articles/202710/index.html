    <h4>  About virtual servers </h4><br>  It's no secret that lately virtual servers have become very popular.  When the shared hosting begins to be missed, and the project has not yet reached a dedicated server, the VPS is an excellent ‚Äútransitional‚Äù option.  There are many advantages of this type of hosting: <br><ul><li>  You can change any settings </li><li>  For iron watching hoster </li><li>  There are no server neighbors that may cause brakes </li><li>  Price lower than when renting a dedicated server </li></ul><br>  Of course, there are also disadvantages compared to shared hosting: <br><ul><li>  Price is usually higher </li><li>  Need to do a VPS setup or buy a control panel. </li><li>  Weak virtual servers may run slower than shared hosting </li></ul><br>  However, in my opinion, when the shared hosting begins to be missed, then a virtual server is the best option for the transition. <br><br>  The reason for the rapid growth in the number of hosters that provide such services is that recently there have been a lot of ‚Äúboxed‚Äù solutions for configuring VPS: solusvm, vePortal, VMmanager, VEmanager, Parallels Virtuozzo Containers and others. <br>  All such systems allow you to quickly deploy a node to create virtual machines.  Such a solution has one big plus - a web interface through which work with virtual machines takes place.  The administrator can easily manage the virtual machines, and the client can reboot the VPS or reinstall the OS without contacting the hoster. <br><br><h4>  about the project </h4><br>  Recently, I often have to deal with virtual servers: various projects require settings that cannot be made on shared hosting.  I had the experience of communicating with a large number of hosters that offer such services, but the current market no longer allows us to keep all the hosters in mind.  At that moment I had the idea to make a directory with the ability to search for VPS by various parameters.  I did not immediately consider sharing hosting, but I have been thinking about dedicated servers for a long time, but I also decided to refuse. <br><br><h4>  Functional </h4><br>  With virtual servers, everything is pretty simple.  A limited list of parameters by which it is easy to search: the volume of the hard disk, the amount of RAM, the frequency of the processor, the amount of traffic provided and the price per month - most often the user is important.  Also at the moment you can filter by the type of virtualization and the country in which the virtual server is located. <br>  A little later, I plan to add the ability to filter by the availability of free administration, the presence of a free control panel, the type of hard disk and the type of platform. <br><br> <a href="http://poiskvps.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c8/fea/d6d/9c8fead6d09011aede3012b415d78b67.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  At the moment, the project added information about <a href="http://poiskvps.ru/companies.php">150 hosts</a> and more than 1200 tariffs. <br>  All rates are grouped, if such grouping is possible.  If the hoster offers identical parameters in two different countries, for convenience, two such tariffs are combined into one. <br><br>  For hosters such a project may be of interest as an additional advertising platform and means of communication with users.  Already, any hoster can create an account on the project, and after it is confirmed, such an account will have the status of a hosting provider representative.  In the future, it will be possible to edit rates, change information about the company, add promo codes or information about promotions from such an account.  Also, when communicating on the forum, it will be immediately apparent that the representative of which host is responding. <br><br><h4>  Statistics </h4><br>  Since only Russian hosters were added to the database (with a few exceptions), Russia wins by the number of tariffs - almost 50% of hosters prefer to host their servers in the territory of the Russian Federation.  Following are the United States (25%), Germany (22%), the Netherlands (16%) and Ukraine (14%). <br><br>  By type of virtualization wins openVZ - about 40% of hosters offer tariffs on this type of virtualization.  The advantages from the hoster are obvious: easier setup and the possibility of an overcell.  OpenVZ is followed by KVM virtualization - 35% of hosters use it.  XEN virtualization is used by approximately 15% of hosters.  Virtuozzo, Huper-V, VMware and FreeBSD Jail use a total of about 15% of hosters. <br><br><h4>  Future of the project </h4><br>  Project development plans are quite large.  For a start, I want to expand the base and add a fairly large number of hosters.  About 150 more are already waiting for the 150 already existing in the add-on queue. When hosters have the opportunity to independently edit their tariffs, additional search parameters will appear: administration availability, control panel presence, platform and hard disk type.  Also on the way is a section with promotions and hosters. <br><br><h4>  Hosting reviews </h4><br>  On similar projects you can often find feedback on the work of hosting providers.  Unfortunately, as practice has shown, most often such reviews hosters leave themselves or write bad reviews to competitors.  There are virtually no methods for dealing with such cheatings, so I decided not to add such a section yet. <br><br><h4>  Monetization </h4><br>  At the moment, the project does not use any means of monetization.  In the future, I plan to use affiliate programs of hosters and various methods of paid attention: for example, highlighting the host name in a different color or something like that. <br><br><h4>  Hoster </h4><br>  If for some reason you did not find yourself in the catalog and want your rates to be added to our database, please write a request in free form to the address: <a href="">info@poiskvps.ru</a> .  However, your project must meet the following requirements: <br><ul><li>  You have fixed rates, not a ‚Äúconstructor‚Äù </li><li>  You have clearly indicated the price for rent for one month </li><li>  Do you have a Russian version of the site </li><li>  Technical support answers in Russian </li></ul><br>  I will be glad to hear feedback and comments about the project! <br><br>  PS Thank you <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/andorro/" class="user_link">andorro</a> for help with editing the text. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202710/</a></p>
