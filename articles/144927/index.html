  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AimTask, or how we did the task scheduler</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br>  In this article I will tell you about how my friends and I made our version of the GTD software implementation and what we finally got. <br>  How did we do this and what did we want to get in the end?  How did it all start and how did it end? <br>  Is it still interesting for you?  Then, as they say, welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started about a year ago with my acquaintance with the customer and ideologist of our project.  After a short telephone conversation with him, only what was needed to do some kind of program was postponed in my head, such as for the internal needs of the institution where the customer himself works, in which it will be possible to create and store his notes, in general, just spit for a month.  Therefore, I went to a meeting with the customer with a clear confidence that I will now be given a small TK, I will do everything quickly and receive my modest reward. <br><br>  However, it turned out at the meeting that we need to do a little more, namely, a task management system that will work on all possible platforms, with the ability to work offline, online, synchronize data in the cloud and still be as simple and understandable as any housewife.  Also, according to him, this system should be a direct competitor to such generally accepted classics of the genre as Wunderlist, Getflow, etc.  My reaction?  After 2 years of work at a military factory for the implementation of protocols for exchanging devices and fashioning brick interfaces for the needs of the military ... Yes, damn it!  Ready!  When to start?  This proposal was like a breath of fresh air and seemed like an opportunity to realize the already long-forgotten dream of doing something sensible, kind, eternal and leave its mark on history. <br><br>  Having received a couple of days to think it over, I said goodbye to the customer and on the way home I began to develop an action plan.  And so I can do it myself, at work I write in C ++ / Qt, I love Qt and I like the pluses, so without any questions the desktop client will write me.  In addition, he immediately covers 3 platforms Windows, Mac and Linux, and with a very limited budget, this seemed to be a great solution.  Someone will say that writing interfaces on the pros for a long time and is not effective, in short hemorrhoids.  However, I think that the main thing is not what you write, but what you write, I mean hands.  And each programming language or framework has its own troubles ... The developer has an app on the desktop client, you can always rely on yourself. <br>  But then?  We need clients for android, ios, a good web client and, most importantly, a synchronization server itself.  Who else would be drawn into this adventure?  Of course, university mates.  After serving after one bench for 6 years, it is with them that you know who is capable of what, better than any recruiting agency with experience. <br>  Ranged calls.  Lech Zdarova!  A hundred years have not seen how myself?  What are you working on?  ‚Ä¶ I, too.  Yes, there is a topic here to earn some money ... Let‚Äôs have a beer tomorrow evening; we‚Äôll discuss there ... Listen, and where is Serge?  Is it the same?  Listen, give it to a mobile phone, and then my pipe sank old, the contacts are covered with everything ... Sereg zdarova, how are you?  Do you understand servers in servaki?  .......  Kiryukh hello ... who is the horse in the coat, let's rake up tomorrow night ... <br>  Total + 4 developers for each of the remaining platforms, and the server.  Further meetings in pizzerias and pubs, meetings with the customer, drawing up a new real TZ, creating a project page on wikia, disassembling with deadlines, getting acquainted with GTD various creative conceptual debates, changing the ios developer and searching for a new, random meeting of a former classmate who helped us with the design ... and a lot of programming, in the evenings nights and weekends. <br>  And a year has passed.  What do we have now?  We have a server, a client for Windows / Mac (alpha), almost an alpha android client, ios and web clients that are still too early to use ... <br>  Well, a couple of words about why we consider our system the <s>best in the world</s> attractive: <br>  - simple and beautiful interface, strict and without pathos. <br>  - synchronization (your tasks are available to you wherever there is Internet) <br>  - the ability to work offline (if there is no Internet) <br>  - possibility of group work (creating tasks for each other) <br>  - in each task there is a field for its discussion ‚Äúcorrespondence‚Äù <br>  - in correspondence you can attach files <br>  - convenient system for searching and filtering tasks <br>  - you can not register in the system and use the client as a local notebook <br>  - we made an alpha version of the one we saw it ourselves, and we will be happy if you help us make our system even better with our comments and suggestions.

      Anyone can download Windows and Mac clients <a href="">here</a> and <a href="">here</a> . <br><br>  Well, a couple of screenshots in the end.  Screenshots are only for windows because the client interface for Mac and Linux is identical and the client interfaces for ios, android and browsers are also very similar except for the differences made in favor of ios and android guidelines. <br><br>  Authorization screen <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8cf/600/2e8/8cf6002e8d15c71f9e6a4b8f4163f4d1.png" alt="image"><br>  Task list <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0e3/e6d/c39/0e3e6dc39027adfb48a0f41413e56397.png" alt="image"><br>  Correspondence area in the task <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/082/07c/e44/08207ce44c9c3b58c1ec7fb1329c3fed.png" alt="image"><br><br>  PS I apologize in advance and ask not to judge strictly for possible bugs, especially under MacOs, all the same it is alpha. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144927/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144927/</a></p>
