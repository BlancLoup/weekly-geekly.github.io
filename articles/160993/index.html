  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Problems with authorization in Windows 8 Pro</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few hours ago I ran into a problem: I could not log in to Windows 8 Pro with my password. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Here is how it was. <br>  Recently I installed Windows 8 on a laptop (I updated it with Windows 7 according to the Windows Upgrade Offer program), and set up a freshly installed OS.  I had one account with administrative rights and it was associated with a Microsoft account. <br>  Today, suddenly the laptop rebooted (I don‚Äôt know what it was), and when I downloaded it I installed some regular updates.  After that I tried to log in, but received a message: <br><blockquote>  Wrong password.  Make sure you use the password for your Microsoft account.  You can always reset it to account.live.com/password/reset. </blockquote><br>  This is the same message in English: <br><blockquote>  That password is incorrect.  Make sure you‚Äôre using your password for your Microsoft account.  You can always reset it at account.live.com/password/reset. </blockquote><br>  I changed the password to account.live.com, but I still could not log in.  Since I did not create other users, I completely lost access to the laptop. <br><br>  Well, that there is another computer, began to look for a solution on the Internet.  I did not find anything in Russian.  But in English, a <a href="https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dsite:answers.microsoft.com%2Bwindows%2B8%2B%2522That%2Bpassword%2Bis%2Bincorrect%2522">large number of questions</a> were found from those facing the same problem, the minimum date that I met was October 27th.  Despite the presence of questions, I did not find any answers.

    <h5>  Decision </h5><br>  He began to act himself. <br>  Before installing the distribution Windows 8 recorded on the disk.  Boot from this disk, chose ‚ÄúSystem Restore‚Äù instead of installation.  Further ‚ÄúDiagnostics‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúAdvanced Settings‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúSystem Restore‚Äù.  I chose the last restore point, but for some reason the restoration failed.  After that, I repeated all the actions, only now I rolled back to the penultimate point.  This restore was successful, and after rebooting I managed to log in. <br>  Since the restore point was created a few days ago, all the settings made since that moment were lost and the installed programs were lost. <br><br>  Perhaps there are other solutions, for example, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-security/cant-login-to-windows-8/e991d3f9-7c05-44fc-8635-a7d06dc76ddc">it</a> says <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-security/cant-login-to-windows-8/e991d3f9-7c05-44fc-8635-a7d06dc76ddc">here</a> that you can boot in safe mode, and then go through authorization, then the authorization seems to be working as usual.  But I did not check this option, as it is not so easy to get into safe mode. <br><br>  <b>Addition 1</b> : <br>  Found a way to boot in safe mode (though not very simple).  The method is based on data from this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/zxue/archive/2012/03/08/win8-howto-20-how-to-start-windows-8-in-safe-mode.aspx">post</a> . <br>  Boot from the DVD, choose system restore, launch the console. <br>  In the console, type the command <br><blockquote>  bcdedit </blockquote><br>  It will show what download options are available.  We are looking for our system among them. <br>  Next, create a copy of the system boot settings: <br><blockquote>  bcdedit / copy {system ID} / d ‚Äúdescription of a copy of settings‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Reboot.  When booting, a menu will appear to select the boot option. <br>  Below the menu there will be a link to go to advanced settings, it is through them that you can get to the download in safe mode.  Screenshots of these menus can be viewed <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/107511/how-to-boot-into-safe-mode-on-windows-8-the-easy-way/">here</a> . <br>  Such a complex way is relevant, if you can not log in at all, as I had, otherwise you can use the simpler option described in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/zxue/archive/2012/03/08/win8-howto-20-how-to-start-windows-8-in-safe-mode.aspx">the same message</a> . <br><br>  <b>Addition 2</b> : <br>  Perhaps the most correct way suggested by <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/mstyura/" class="user_link">mstyura</a> in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/160993/">comments</a> is to activate the built-in administrator account. <br>  It also needs a distribution disc.  How to activate the administrator with screenshots described <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/75470/how-to-enable-the-hidden-windows-7-admin-account-using-the-registry/">here</a> .  In short, the steps are as follows: <br><ol><li>  Download from DVD. </li><li>  We select system recovery. </li><li>  Run the console. </li><li> From the console, use the <code>regedit</code> start the registry editor. </li><li>  In the registry, select the bush <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</code> . </li><li>  In the file menu, select "Load hive ...". </li><li>  On the system disk (in my case it was an E: disk, although Windows is installed on C :) we find the file "% windir% \ system32 \ config \ SAM" (you cannot simply substitute the specified path, since% windir% points to the system DVD). </li><li>  The editor asks for the name of the bush, let's call it ‚Äútest‚Äù. </li><li>  Go to "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE \ test \ SAM \ Domains \ Account \ Users \ 000001F4". </li><li>  Open to edit the value of "F". </li><li>  At offset 0038, we replace 11 by 10. </li><li>  Click on the ‚Äútest‚Äù bush and select ‚ÄúUnload the bush ...‚Äù. </li><li>  Reboot. </li><li>  The ‚ÄúAdministrator‚Äù user should appear.  We enter under it, but what to do next, honestly, I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs probably necessary somehow to either reset the password or unbind the account from liveID. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>Supplement 3 (12/03/2012):</b> <br>  Again the same mistake.  Looks like you have to give up liveID.  It‚Äôs good that I now have a local administrator account and a recovery point was created right before the reboot. <br>  This time the problem occurred after installing Media Center. <br>  Later supplement the results of recovery. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Why am I all this: if you still have only one account associated with a Microsoft account, then just in case, create another local account with administrative rights.  Also create a disk or flash drive for system recovery. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160993/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160993/</a></p>
