This problem is eternal and we are no exception.  Therefore, I would like to speculate about the current needs of frostbitten and other dissidents. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="vvedenie">  Introduction </h2><br><p>  For example, in the recent past, managers were desperately needed.  It was the cutting edge of science and the ultimate dream.  I remember, then I just walked under the table and heard these cries about the managers from each radio and TV.  Much later, I read the sane description of the manager and finally understood what their meaning was.  Those were called Comrade <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9,_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%2590%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Agranovsky</a> in a review of his <a href="https://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/6760707/">Collection of essays, feuilletons, articles</a> . </p><br><blockquote>  Complicating production, increasingly multifaceted tasks that arise in all areas of the economy, science, education, gave rise to a new profession.  Unfortunately, we have not yet come up with a name for it.  In the West, called: manager.  And this is a kind of activity, without which not a single undertaking can do there - neither big nor small.  Strictly speaking, the manager is not an expert in any one sphere, but he can ‚Äúput in‚Äù, set up almost every thing. </blockquote><p>  A century earlier, merchants were in high esteem and usurers.  Unfortunately, in those centuries I am not a great connoisseur, so without details. </p><br><p>  So here.  Today, merchants are not uncommon, but an integral part of life.  For managers, too, at the very least, the infrastructure was adjusted.  They invented all sorts of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">MBA</a> , opened <a href="https://stratoplan.ru/">Stratoplan</a> and generally put this business on stream.  Of course there is much to strive for and there is always a shortage of personnel, but progress is evident. </p><br><p>  But the miracle did not happen and strange new professionals are still needed. </p><br><h2 id="kogo-zhe-ne-hvataet">  Who is missing? </h2><br><p>  I think that with all the discontent with the modern world, we (in the sense of humanity) have learned how to organize small and large enterprises, know how to organize business processes in them and produce both purely physical and purely ephemeral things.  But this does not end there. </p><br><p>  Now we want to improve our factories, factories and IT start-ups so that the result will appear faster, be better and cheaper than anything that already exists or may appear in the near future. </p><br><p>  Therefore, it seems logical need for people who are constantly in motion, in search and research.  Which do not limit your day to eight working hours and do not burden yourself with job descriptions.  Those who have a job mixed with life, life with work and in general everything is difficult.  In general, those who just fucked up.  In the best sense of the word. </p><br><h2 id="a-chto-ranshe-takih-ne-bylo">  And what, before there were none? </h2><br><p>  Of course, fucking gentlemen and ladies have always been.  Look, you can look at <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC%25D1%2581">Robert Williams Wood</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4_%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581">Richard Feynman,</a> or the crowd of <a href="https://storia.me/%40gipsylilya/ura-ya-ne-zamuzhem-3nm3gs">Victorian virgins</a> who burned as best they could. </p><br><p>  But earlier this need was not of a global nature.  For manufactories and factories, many dissidents were unnecessarily.  A couple of centuries earlier, they were burned at the stake.  Even for the construction of rockets they needed a little.  The majority went to science, to their business and tried not to shine.  And now they are beginning to want everything.  And some think immediately about the department of such comrades, taking the idea of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skunk_works">Skunk Work</a> into service. </p><br><p>  To heaps, now there is a lot of opportunities to be on your mind, create anything and not be torn to pieces by the crowd.  Morals have become softer, incomes are more even, and transport accessibility is much better.  Moreover, society itself began to encourage all kinds of strange personalities! </p><br><h2 id="pro-inakomyslyaschih">  About dissidents </h2><br><p>  I like to call these old people the most weird.  Because it is like the "quality" of "Zen and the art of motorcycle care."  Everyone intuitively understands what it is about, but words are difficult to explain.  After all, admit it, you immediately remembered a couple of your acquaintances who are enchantingly dolbanuty or frostbitten.  And no, I'm not talking about those who simply have no king in their heads, but about those who were hurt in the best sense of the word. </p><br><p>  So, now try to find something in common with them.  I have a very good chance. </p><br><h3 id="primery">  Examples </h3><br><p>  Now let's give a few examples to know exactly what we are talking about the same.  The blessing to go far is not necessary.  On Habr√© good half of these. </p><br><p>  Vaughn, take the same <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/meklon/" class="user_link">Meklon</a> .  It seems like a doctor ... only in a "telescope" he examines coffee, bakes breads and mocks at dishwashers.  Not to mention that linuksoid.  And this is just what he honestly admitted. </p><br><p>  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/milfgard/" class="user_link">Milfgard</a> generally honestly calls himself a freak.  And I believe him.  And who else can break the poor kids in the breaks between Africa, Australia and the Azores by means of new training boards and look for ways to evenly color the figures? </p><br><p>  Among personal acquaintances, there are also strange shots: </p><br><ul><li>  a dancer-teacher with an uncertain geographical position, resting with an aqualung and paragliding in an embrace; </li><li>  Eychar-rolevik, able to do near-zero routine in the mass-recruitment and pretending to be a thick orc in the evenings; </li><li>  programmer-photographer engaged in post-production, toys on Sharpe and linking the tax code with voluntary donations. </li></ul><br><p>  In general, many of them ... only encrypted. </p><br><h3 id="chto-obschego">  What common? </h3><br><p>  We now turn to the characteristics.  Probably the most important common part of the fallen ones is that they are all different.  Seriously.  This in Durkee can be a whole floor of the Napoleons.  And among these guys there are two identical ones in principle.  Although many are similar ... only I did not understand what.  Just dolbanuty and pleasant to talk to. </p><br><p>  Otherwise, I can only list the observed properties and signs: </p><br><ul><li>  do not know how to do garbage; </li><li>  there is no division of work and non-work, all life; </li><li>  love life and live =&gt; inner motivation is always bundled; </li><li>  do not know how to live boring, in particular, can rest so that they get tired more than at work; </li><li>  do not recognize the authorities, only experts in specific areas based on the results of long-term observation, communication and participation in common projects; </li><li>  adventurers by nature and experimenters in life; </li><li>  in addition to the professional area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest, which is thoroughly understood, there are many side, but very unexpected branches (Eychar-rolevik, programmer-cameraman, DBA-ballerina, developer-theologian, etc.). </li></ul><br><p>  By virtue of the above points, the profit from them is appropriate: they not only do the work well, but also beyond the limits, they do not need to be customized and motivated, they themselves will give an estimate of time and labor, they have an internal Wang and they know how to use it.  However, if you do not understand what to do with them, or if your vision did not coincide with their vision, you will suffer. </p><br><h2 id="chto-zhe-delat">  What to do? </h2><br><p>  Love them ... in general, like everyone else.  Carefully choose a freak for the peculiarities of the team and the project.  To grow them and, if they got one, don‚Äôt bother them.  They themselves will do everything that is necessary.  As a maximum, you can specify the highest priority for work.  As <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A7%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA,_%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581_%25D0%2595%25D0%25B2%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Chertok</a> wrote about the time of the beginning of rocket and space development: </p><br><blockquote>  The general requirement for higher structures came down to "help, but do not interfere!" </blockquote><p>  Here is exactly the same case. </p><br><p>  After all, the most important thing is not to get scared.  Here an analogy with criticism will do: at first they were afraid of it, then they turned their brains around and realized that there is nothing better than criticism and complaints, for they are pointing the way to improvements.  With fucking the same. </p><br><h2 id="pro-buduschee">  About the future </h2><br><p> I can see straightforwardly how inquiries appear for recruits.  Now everyone wants ninjas, fullstek and js.  That is an emphasis on purely technical skills and experience.  But they still did not understand that happiness is not in technology.  The current method of evaluation and selection is simply more measurable.  But the real profit in the interest and concise application and interweaving of various (technical and non-technical) areas. </p><br><p>  Also, a noticeable increase in the number of remotes over the past couple of years.  And the requirements for them are slightly different than for the office.  Some of the above-mentioned qualities are necessary for them by default, because remotely everything is a little wrong: it is more difficult to motivate and entertain their employees, it is necessary that they themselves invent non-working activities and do not kick the bolt in the workers' tasks.  Therefore, I think that there will be a lot of things on the remote, because the format of work with their worldview is the same. </p><br><p>  Also, it seems to me that cultivating dolbanut can only be in a working atmosphere.  School and institute are not helpers here.  Rather, they are about instilling identity and about the basic picture of the world.  And any professional courses are too short.  Therefore, the benefit of those who have the right goals and values, plus a relaxing working atmosphere in the team and the company. </p></div>
