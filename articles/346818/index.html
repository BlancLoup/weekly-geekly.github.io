In order not to be a noob in English and to speak it correctly, we have prepared a list of words with the pronunciation of which the most difficulties arise.  Let's rock them, dudes! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zl/-2/n2/zl-2n2pn8clqytag4learnuishc.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>ACAI</b> <br>  If suddenly, staying in New York, they decided to drop into a local smoothie shop to treat themselves to a cocktail with Acai berries, then in no case speak English: ah + SIGH + berry, ACK + ah + ee or ah + KAI .  Remember that stress always falls on the third or last syllable: ah + sigh + EE [asʌɪˈi]. <br><br>  <b>APPLICABLE</b> <br>  The English adjective "applicable" - suitable begins with "app - application", let it be a reminder, where to put the emphasis: APP + lic + able ['æplɪkəbl], but not a + PLICK + able.

      <br>
      <b>ARCTIC</b> <br>  More attention to the first consonant "with".  Learners of English often miss this letter, and as a result you get ART + ick, because  consonant with the "antarctic - Antarctic", the correct version: ARC-tic ['ɑː®ktɪk] - Arctic. <br><br>  <b>CACHE</b> <br>  No, this is not an insidious word from the French language.  The tendency to say cash + AY lies in the pronunciation of the similar word “cachet ['kæʃeɪ] - sign”, while “cache [kæʃ] is a cache”. <br><br>  <b>ELECTORAL</b> <br>  Apparently, this is the most unloved word in America for 2016;  e + LEK + tor + al [le'lekt (ə) r () l] - electoral / electoral, by no means e + lek + TOR + al. <br><br>  <b>FEBRUARY</b> <br>  In fact, this month is pronounced FEB + ru + ar + ree ['fɛbrʊəri] - February, but not FEB + ru + ree or FEB + ar + ree. <br><br>  <b>FORTE</b> <br>  Music gurus can pronounce this word as for + TAY.  And if you mean the composer's note to play a piece of music alive and loud, then everything is ok.  However, if reading notes from a sheet is your forte, here also “forte” is meant, only transcription is already [ˈfȯrt]. <br><br>  <b>Foyer</b> <br>  And, again, the habit of speaking French.  However, meeting guests at foy + AY will not make a better first impression.  Remember: the lobby - FOY + ur [ˈfȯi () r]. <br><br>  <b>GALA</b> <br>  An example of a word where the sound “ay”, on the contrary, will have to be in place.  If you attend a solemn event, it is GAY + luh ['geɪlə], but not GAL + uh. <br><br>  <b>GENRE</b> <br>  The word is often used, but only a few know that “genre is a genus / species / genre” will be ZHON + ruh [ʒɔŋrə], but not JEN + ner. <br><br>  <b>Gyro</b> <br>  Delicious Greek shawarma with pork and tomato sauce should not sound like a gyroscope [ˈdʒaırə, skəʊp].  Valid options are YEE + roh ['yērəʊ] or ZHIHR + oh [' zhirəʊ]. <br><br>  <b>HYPERBOLE</b> <br>  No jokes, the word hy + PER + ba + lee [haɪ'pɜːb () lɪ], consisting of four syllables, has nothing to do with the “bowl” thanks to Greek roots.  Interesting fact: the antonym of hyperbola is considered “litotes - litos”, which is pronounced LYE-tuh-teez [laɪ'təutiːz]. <br><br>  <b>LIABLE</b> <br>  Do not confuse the meaning of the following legal terms: “liability - responsibility / obligation”, thus “liable - responsible”, LIE + a + ble ['laɪəb () l];  but "libel [ˈlaıbǝl] is defamation / slander." <br><br>  <b>LIBRARY</b> <br>  The same story as with the word February, the successive sounds of the “r” give a lot of inconvenience when even professors of colleges and politicians speak.  However, always LIE + brare + ee ['laɪbr (ə) rɪ] - library. <br><br>  <b>MAUVE</b> <br>  Whether or not you like the trendy mauve shade of 2018, say MAWV [məuv], but not [ˈmov]. <br><br>  <b>MEME</b> <br>  Long before Grumpy Cat conquered Instagram, in 1976, a British scientist invented the word "meme - a unit of cultural inheritance."  Although we read this word more often than we pronounce it, we mean: not mee-mee, may-may or even mem, but always MEEM [miːm]. <br><br>  <b>MISCHIEVOUS</b> <br>  Another mistake in the pronunciation, which is inextricably linked with writing.  However, do not add the extra “i” as in mis + CHEEV + i + ous, only MIS + chiv + ous ['mɪsʧɪvəs] - naughty / naughty. <br><br>  <b>Often</b> <br>  Believe it or not, pronouncing the consonant "t" in a word is considered to be incorrect, at least according to Merriam-Webster.  Although the option of OFF + ten compared to OFF + en, allegedly, is unacceptable and controversial, many Americans and other netivy say that way. <br><br>  <b>NICHE</b> <br>  Although NEESH [niːʃ] is quite common, but it is NITCH [nɪtʃ] - an established and popular option when it comes to some particular place or field of activity. <br><br>  <b>NUCLEAR</b> <br>  The American presidents: Bush, Clinton, Carter and Eisenhower had obvious problems with the pronunciation of this seemingly uncomplicated word.  It turned out NEAR-clew instead of NEW-clear ['njuːklɪə] - nuclear.  This is due to the linguistic phenomenon - metathesis (rearrangement of syllables / sounds). <br><br>  <b>Pizza</b> <br>  With pepperoni and parmesan or king prawns and mozzarella, but the pizza in English is not at all PI + za, but only PEET + suh ['piːtsə]. <br><br>  <b>PRELUDE</b> <br>  Although sometimes a church short musical composition is meant, the first syllable is not pronounced like the word “pray”.  The noun and the verb "prelude" come from the Latin "praeludere", which means to play in advance.  Thus PREL + yood ['preljuːd] is a prelude, beginning / introduction. <br><br>  <b>REGARDLESS</b> <br>  Although the netivs use “irregardless” instead of “regardless”, but if you decide to use the latter, then only re + GUARD + less [rɪ'gɑːdləs], not [rɪ'gɑːdləs]. <br><br>  <b>PRONUNCIATION</b> <br>  By the way, not everyone pronounces the word “pronunciation” - pronunciation is correct, probably because it seems to everyone that there is a syllable “noun” there, although this is not so.  Therefore: pro + NUN + see + a + shun [prəˌnʌn (t) sɪ'eɪʃ (ə) n]. <br><br>  <b>REALTOR</b> <br>  Another case is when the brain tries to spell a word, so also, for convenience, add a vowel: REE + la + tur.  So, when looking for a new home in England, for example, you can easily pass for the phonetic noob.  Be careful, the correct version sounds: REEL + tur ['riːltə]. <br><br>  <b>REGIME</b> <br>  This refers to political preferences, system, power or not, but never pronounce the regime as RUH + geem, only RAY + geem [reɪ'ʒiːm]. <br><br>  <b>SHERBET</b> <br>  Let's finally clarify the situation with “sherbet” and “sherbert”.  The word sherbet (oriental drink) comes from the Turkish "şerbet" and the Persian "sharbat", therefore in the last syllable there will never be a consistent "r".  A dessert made from fruits with sugar and ice will be “sorbet” - sor-BAY ['sɪbe], but not “sherbet” - SHOR-bet [' ʃɜːbət]. <br><br>  <b>STATUS</b> <br>  If you say “status” as STAH-tus throughout your life, you are not alone.  However, it is never too late to fix it: STAY + tus ['steɪtəs]. <br><br>  <b>SUIT</b> <br>  Your hotel room is probably pretty sweet, unlike the work suite (suite).  Don't even think about saying something like sue-TAY, only SWEET [swiːt]. <br><br>  <b>TRANSIENT</b> <br>  The word transient means fleeting / transient, however, by mistake, many say tran + ZEE + ent, and you need TRAN + shent [ˈtrænʃənt]. <br><br>  <b>TRIATHLON</b> <br>  Athletes who take part in a triathlon are awesome, however, this kind of competition is never pronounced as tri-ATH-a-lon, only tri + ATH + len [trʌɪ'aθllən]. <br><br>  <b>VALET</b> <br>  Remember Downton Abbey, where heroes often turn to valets.  The word sounds more British VAL + it ['vælɪt], rather than the French val + AY. <br><br>  <i>Many phonetic errors arise from the fact that we often assume: high speed of speech = fluency in a foreign language.</i>  <i>Do not run ahead of the engine, knowledge and fluency come with time.</i>  <i>Do not rush, pronounce the words, and if in doubt, be sure to check the pronunciation of the word in the dictionary.</i> <br><br><h4>  Reader Bonuses <br></h4><br><br> <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/prices/habronline2/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3Dtypicalmistakes"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wb/-e/xy/wb-exycjqweyt7eybaint3zm_rw.png"></a> <br><br>  Leave a request for a <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3Dtypicalmistakes">free introductory lesson</a> on Skype8 and receive at the first payment with the promotional code <a href="https://www.englishdom.com/prices/goodhabr2/%3Futm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_source%3Dhabra%26utm_campaign%3Dtypicalmistakes">goodhabr2</a> +2 lessons as a gift.
