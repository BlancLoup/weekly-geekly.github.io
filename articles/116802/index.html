  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Where to look for experts?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you read Saprykin's columns in the "Poster"?  He is now moving Glavred in Slon.Ru, although, they say, will continue to write for the "Poster".  One of his last <a href="http://www.afisha.ru/article/8887/">columns</a> is called ‚ÄúWhere did the experts go?‚Äù  He says that there were few experts; they were pressed by the ‚Äúspecialists in trade and procurement operations‚Äù and Google that had multiplied in recent years.  And in general, in Russia, "for each individual segment of reality, as a rule, there is a single expert who can tell something distinct." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  With Saprykin, of course, you can agree, you can argue.  However, he knows how to remind that we, it seems like, and we already know, but have forgotten, have ceased to think about it.  We used to get used to everything.  But this question, connected with experts, really worries us.  We want to argue. <br><br>  We are engaged in the evaluation and implementation of innovative projects and the promotion of innovative products in various fields.  For us, the expert community is a key asset.  They are involved in the process of selecting ideas and projects, evaluating their scientific and technical potential.  We appreciate the experts, we pay them well.  It is important for us that they are, and we know that they are. <br><br>  Here Saprykin writes that experts have become extinct or are hiding somewhere.  And by what criteria are these people evaluated?  There is an assumption that in order to become an expert in some field, you need to spend ten thousand hours at one lesson.  It's about seven years, five hours a day.  Do you think this is enough?  Or rather, this: is it generally the right criterion to consider the depth of understanding of a topic in man-hours?  Why then not in human letters for outstanding contributions to the achievement of something?  Or in the man-medals on the man-chest?

      We, of course, will not find the only instrument capable of measuring this depth, because we are not looking.  But we believe that a real expert is an objective skeptic, in love with his subject, like a beautiful woman (or a strong man, someone to whom).  He does not stand still, uses for development any opportunity and is oriented in his field, as a good developer in his environment.  And his opinion is worth a lot. <br><br>  By the way, you probably already understood - we need experts.  One of the directions of our work is IT projects.  Therefore, we decided to come to you.  Where else to look for knowledgeable IT specialists, if not on Habr√©?  You can apply for participation in the expert community on our website.  There is also information about the projects that we are currently implementing.  <a href="http://innoros.ru/projects/expert">Welcome!</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116802/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116802/</a></p>
