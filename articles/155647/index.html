At MIPT, this takes place as part of the annual course ‚ÄúInnovation Workshop‚Äù.  The goal of the project is to enable students in the learning process to solve problems that are more close to real than it happens in the normal learning process.  And ‚Äúimmerse‚Äù them at the same time in the appropriate environment: the environment in which the development takes place is a real-life IT company. <br></div></div><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Past projects</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <u><b>Formula Recognition</b></u> <u><br></u>  Formulation of the problem: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49a/7c1/d40/49a7c1d40e502db77d684f0da1a39b94.gif" alt="image">  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/abbyy/blog/117682/">Student laboratories ABBYY</a> <br>  The solution of the problem: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49a/7c1/d40/49a7c1d40e502db77d684f0da1a39b94.gif" alt="image">  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/abbyy/blog/136506/">ABBYY Labs - what's new?</a> <br></div></div><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Current projects</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <u><b>Question-answer system</b></u> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/49a/7c1/d40/49a7c1d40e502db77d684f0da1a39b94.gif" alt="image">  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/abbyy/blog/150273/">ABBYY Labs.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/abbyy/blog/150273/">Q &amp; A Project: Start</a> <br>  <u><b>Android app</b></u> <br>  ‚Üì <br></div></div><br>  <u><b>Brief:</b></u> <br>  The project is called ‚ÄúFromWord‚Äù and reached the stage ‚Äúthe Android application is <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dlingvo.games.fromword.free%26hl%3Dru">uploaded to the Play Market</a> , there are 700+ downloads‚Äù.  It is done by students as part of their studies at MIPT under the guidance of a programmer from ABBYY.  Under the cut there will be a story about how the process went, plans for the future and, of course, a qr-code. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At the stage of the formation of a team, difficulties arose: time is limited, and people come and go.  3 + 3-3 + 1 + 1 + 2-2-2.  In the end, after a series of such perturbations, there was a team of 3 people, 2/3 represented by the fair sex.  Since  the period of formation of the team took a lot of time, it was impossible to delay, because the deadline is strictly defined by the curriculum.  The work began, but it was necessary for the curator to leave for 3 weeks, and he did it with great fear ‚Äî would he manage without him? <br><br>  However, not all students are equally lazy (or maybe not all studies are equally interesting :)) - by the time the curator returned, it was revealed that the guys not only detailed the TK, but also implemented the main functionality of the application! <br><br>  They wanted to make a game (it's fun!), But learning something useful.  So that people, if they have free time and a smartphone, take up the brain with something more productive than scattering birds over pigs.  In the invented game, the task of users is to drag and drop existing English words, collecting sentences from them.  The project participants rightly decided that it was not only an interesting logical task, but also a rather effective way to activate their vocabulary and knowledge of English grammar. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Technical difficulties have also become apparent: it has become clear that it is not such an easy task to come up with sets of words from which a sentence is drafted in the only correct way (or in a small number of ways).  Well, you yourself think for yourself, how many combinations of permutations are there in the sentence of <abbr title="7! = 5040">7 words?</abbr>  .  Of course, it was unpleasant to be in a situation when the application is already ready, and the process was stopped due to <i>some unhappy content</i> .  But then a friendly linguist came to the rescue (also from ABBYY, of course), who wrote the necessary sentences at his leisure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/323/a2e/10c/323a2e10cf19d7d839e03a081356d90c.png" align="right">  As a result, the guys downloaded the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dlingvo.games.fromword.free%26hl%3Dru">application</a> in the Play Market, and even before the deadline, namely, on September 15.  By the way, the deadline is, of course, important, but the project participants say that now they have in the first place not the requirements of the ‚Äúinnovative practicum‚Äù, but the drive.  You can see that people like the application: the free version was downloaded more than 700 times, 11 people bought the paid version, there are good reviews on the forums and in the market. <br><br>  Plans for the near future: <br><ul><li>  Filling the game with content.  In the <abbr title="By the way, yes. Now the paid version is different from free ads only. Well, that's me, just in case.">paid version</abbr> there will be more topics, they will become even more interesting and useful for studying.  The first differences will be noticeable in mid-November. </li><li>  Bugfixing </li><li>  Application redesign </li></ul><br>  If you are interested in our educational projects - subscribe to the company blog.  The button is somewhere to the right.  If you do not want to subscribe - play with the application - suddenly like it.  However, one does not interfere with another :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88e/b4a/5cb/88eb4a5cbe9c015bf2c43af154316958.gif" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/155647/">https://habr.com/ru/post/155647/</a></p>
