My name is Oleg.  You may have seen me on DenvasTV.  Today I want to tell a little about the life of OnePlus, so to speak, from the inside. <br><br>  Oneplus is the daughter of Oppo.  At the start, many employees, including the CEO (who was the vice president at Oppo), moved to a new company.  In this case, the daughter is quite independent and tries not to advertise their relationship.  But let's get down to business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Work in OnePlus is a test of strength.  The company has a large staff turnover.  Working day from 9:00 to 21:00, 6 days a week.  At the same time, the CEO himself (Pete Lau) usually finishes his work in the middle of the night, laying out 110% and demanding the same from the employees.  Great opportunity to test yourself.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f22/927/62c/f2292762cdf240caab1be65f9fa61b98.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  The average age of the company's employees is 22-24 years.  If I am lucky to get here, I (born in 1988) will be one of the oldest.  It is also worth noting that the international department is completely independent of the Chinese, which was probably one of the reasons for the success of a smartphone outside of China (by the way, this is also the reason why I want to come here - I do not criticize the Chinese, but we have very big cultural differences with them also differences in performance perception). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a3/a11/6d8/1a3a116d8cb2498ebf0961e2741846bf.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  But let's take a look at the office itself and its inhabitants.  This is the most important member of the team and its talisman.  Sorry dog, I forgot your nickname. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/513/20a/183/51320a183e0c4261808cffc82ef115e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  He lives here, cheering and entertaining the workers of OnePlus, in addition, he is the first to welcome guests. <br><br>  Now let's go to the description of jobs.  First of all I would like to pay attention to the work of the international department.  It employs approximately 20 people from all over the world, and they are responsible for marketing and promotion.  Both product and brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/016/eb7/f09/016eb7f0922b41f7af0e26806a78ab98.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Work disorder and business trips happen periodically, so the expression ‚Äúfrom ship to ball‚Äù is the norm here.  During my visit, part of the team was going on a business trip to the negotiations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a26/516/2ca/a265162ca230485dbc253bd62bf511c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition, those who work a lot with their heads need to keep themselves in good physical shape, so the guys requested the gym, which is located almost in the center of the workroom.  Just some who get to work by bike.  Long live the sport! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa9/3fd/941/aa93fd94145842498a3b514625fbf8b2.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, pay attention to the inscription "Do Better Than Ideal."  This inscription fully conveys the message that is required from the workers of OnePlus.  Such posters are placed throughout the office.  For example, the phrase ‚ÄúMove fast and break things‚Äù (by Mark Zuckerberg) is written on a photo with a dog: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/990/faa/b43/990faab43f0f4922a7fa237c4c9c794c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And here is the technical support department.  The amount of work they have is enormous.  On the right was a board with statistics on resolved issues, but they were not allowed to shoot it.  Often the questions are the most fun, and this is despite the fact that most of the phone buyers are people who are familiar with the technology.  Those who have worked or are working in technical support will understand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/13a/c8a/63d13ac8acdd453f810a98e4b7dcf1a0.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Here are the programmers.  Someone is working on the firmware, someone on the site.  In this part of the firmware are developed by a team from Shanghai on the outsource.  If you go straight, you can get to the recreation area, but about it later.  Let's take a look at those responsible for logistics, engineering, legal issues, manufacturing and other issues related to the operation of the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70d/487/4d0/70d4874d02484dbd8e2c883e054b0d6e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This department occupies the largest office area.  When I was here, calls were constantly being heard and some action was taking place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e4/966/61e/9e496661e1814d69bdf7eee3413cd08a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Pay attention to the cot.  In any Chinese company, part of the workers will definitely have a folding bed or a pillow for daytime sleep.  The Chinese believe that 10-15 minutes of sleep relieves fatigue and gives energy.  By the way, 30 minutes after this picture, lunch began. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b8/b94/008/0b8b94008885463ab4d982eabbcf7cdc.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  A small part of people brings food from the house and warms it in the kitchen, while the other part eats in cafes downstairs or in neighboring buildings.  In principle, the price tag is democratic and amounts to 15-30 yuan. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e9/5c8/ba0/1e95c8ba0e3645dfa9a8d0865e8ac60c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So here is a recreation area, you can bask in the sun, or sit in the shade.  In the evening, you can spy on people in neighboring buildings or look at the stars through a telescope.  The view of the night Shenzhen is beautiful, albeit a bit noisy. <br><br>  By the way, about beautiful views: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09d/c54/48d/09dc5448ddad48cf91113589576108a7.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  If you take a good look at the international marketing department, you can see Hong Kong. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f7/27e/c72/0f727ec72ae446f5ad3910e6ca95a850.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We return to the office.  Here you see a warehouse, a meeting room, and a toilet room.  This is the end of the One Plus office tour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcd/a93/012/dcda930124f5495db7aaa51ffe6d80c8.JPG" alt="image"><br><br>  Although, wait, I want to say that almost everyone in the company purchased for themselves and their close ones OnePlus.  In the office, you can hardly see the iPhone, although, as can be seen from the photos, many use Apple products. <br><br>  And lastly, I would like to thank David, Michael, Bridget, and also Denis (Letnick) for the opportunity to write this article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376377/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376377/</a></p>
