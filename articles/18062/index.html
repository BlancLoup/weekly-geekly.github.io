    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1 ACTION <br><br>  So, I heard the news about such a miracle as a reader on electronic paper.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe vital in the air - why waste energy on drawing the screen, when you can create a pixel with two permanent states - bely and black.  And waste electricity only to redraw the picture.  Yo!  Chubais dream!  Thus, it turns out that the battery capacity we are used to will be sufficient for working in terms that are completely unusual for us - not even weeks, but months!  And besides, the contrast of the screen is so good and thanks to the passive (in reflected light) display of the text is so close to the paper that it completely kills all opponents of reading from the screen. <br>  Miracles and only.  Soon the tale is affected and not soon the work is done.  Only relatively recently, devices based on e-paper technology began to leak into the Russian market.  Only the holes are still too small, the producers are fearful (or they don‚Äôt like to read) and I will tell you that the goods have been in short supply.  More scarce than the Three Musketeers in the 80s! <br>  But the hedgehog bare ass does not scare, break through!  I found a small online shop in a poor assortment of which features LBOOK EREADER V3 and so that ‚Äústsuki would not take away‚Äù would call and reserve the goods from the seller.  Warned right away - the reserve is only for today - and tomorrow is a distant matter, you may not live, therefore decide for yourself.  ‚ÄúWe take them like hot cakes,‚Äù the aunt said proudly and put the phone down.  But I didn‚Äôt just hang up, because when I arrive at the office, I discover my reserve that has been canceled and a ‚Äúfull goal-based base‚Äù - no devices! <br>  Offended, I squeeze in a sweaty fist a flash drive on which, especially for this mission, I packed literature in every imaginable electronic format.  All that pumped overwork, and about Python, and about Java, and even about Caml.  But no luck in sight. <br><br>  2 ACTION <br><br>  I was desperate and drove to the subway to Bagration.  On the top crust, I think, I'll wander - it‚Äôs all the same to buy presents on NG. <br>  But waiting for me unthinkable happiness.  In one of the transitions, considering the battery for your PDA, I suddenly saw the familiar LBOOK logo! <br>  Not believing my happiness, I grabbed the coveted device.  The frightened manager was afraid to see that I would run away without paying. <br>  But we are honest citizens - we don‚Äôt need someone else.  But our 11,500 rubles for so just do not give up. <br>  Well, let's look at LBOOK! <br>  A 4GB SD flash drive is sent to the slot.  After thinking for a couple of seconds LBOOK enlightened with what he was dealing with and gave me a catalog of a flash drive.  Sergut  And now, my friend, try to taste the select library of computer reading.  Available on the disc turned out to be the most interesting for the programmer and not trivial formats: <br>  PDF, djVU, CHM, DOC <br>  As for simple TXT, HTML, I did not even look at them.  There are megaton reviews with beautiful screenshots.  With this LBOOK will not understand suddenly. <br><br>  And here they are the first bugs - not all pdf fields are properly cut off when you increase the text.  On some files, a substantial part of the test remains off-screen (a strip approximately one word wide is cut off on the left).  Unfortunately, the option to "move" the text to more accurately hit it in the vaunted screen was not available.  The choice is small - either a general view of the page on which you didn‚Äôt make it out without a small-scale viewer, or an enlarged portrait, but past the frame, or the same glitch only in the portrait orientation of the screen.  All released to the arbitrariness of automation.  And apparently annoying misunderstandings are possible.  I did not understand how this PDF differed from its relatives - it opened on a computer without any problems.  It is possible that the troubles in the firmware have already been resolved or are solved by our brothers Ukrainian programmers from the company MUK. <br>  The proposed CHM files for the little ones were also not read correctly, although the format support is stated.  In all variants of the CHM files, the machine refuses to go to the 4th level in the document structure.  Up to this level, navigation through the document occurs without problems.  Most of the documents presented on the test flash drive opened without any problems and the device made a pleasant impression on me.  I hope that the errors found will be fixed in the next versions of the firmware - especially since the firmware can be upgraded) <br><br>  EPILOGUE <br><br>  Having exhausted the manager, who stood humbly beside him for almost half an hour and listened to my ooh-sighs, I made a decision for myself.  Still, for a person who has a thin PDA with a VGA screen in the breast pocket of his shirt, LBOOK is still not the best alternative and not at the best price. <br>  I repeat - I speak as a person who already has the opportunity to read e-books from the PDA screen.  Today LBOOK is a welcome device for fiction lovers, which is abundant in trivial formats.  As for the lover of technical and computer literature, which I think are also people, here LBOOK does not offer revolutionary breakthroughs, except perhaps for native support of the D√©j√† Vu format (which is quite a lot).  V3 - supports most electronic formats without prior conversion - which is a huge help for Linux users, which manufacturers do not indulge with adapted software for their devices.  But on the other hand, Linux is the stuffing of LBOOK itself, and more can be expected from such a clever system. <br><br>  I would like to e-book: <br>  1. Fill-in display of pdf-documents.  Thank God that the technologies are available and on the PDA they have long been worked out.  Taking into account the size of the 6-inch screen, the filling text display will make the device simply irreplaceable - I will buy it even for 11 thousand 501 rubles! <br>  2. Perhaps a smarter display format djVu.  For in the foreseeable future we live with him!  Since disk volumes have long ceased to be a problem, and even some rarities are valuable not only with text, but also with performance (they used to know how to make book layouts, not like now).  An example of such a smart display in the PDA can serve as a program Smart djVU <br>  3. Search !!!  If someone thinks that books on Python or Java are read from the first page to the last, that is wrong.  And I hope that future e-books will acquire this powerful tool, and at the same time hundreds of thousands of new buyers from among the admins. <br><br>  Personally, I made a decision to leave 11 thousand of rubles for me, and wait until the technical inconsistencies are resolved.  Perhaps in the foreseeable future interesting technical innovations will appear and in big stores they will no longer look at us as fools when we ask, ‚ÄúWhat e-books do you have?‚Äù. <br>  But it is important that the first page in the history of electronic books has already been turned! <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18062/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18062/</a></p>
