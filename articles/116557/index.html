You can also add "GPS", "Glonass", "navigator", "satellite".  Now you understand what will be discussed?  Maybe you saw somewhere, heard, and maybe someone had a Garmin?  Even if the answers to all questions are negative, we are very happy to see you on our Habrablog, we are sure that together we will be interested! <br><br><h2>  Who are we? </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/04e/d56/cac/04ed56cac289c42de9abe4ed72f92e0d.jpg" align="right">  We are people - outstanding, interesting, strong-willed - who, once gathered together, decided to bring the domestic market of navigation devices to a whole new level.  We knew who produces the best navigators, we knew how they work, we knew what they can do, and why they are needed - and we wanted to transfer all this to our customers - to you who read this blog.  Surveyors, engineers, programmers - everyone wanted to make sure that the user never had the feeling of buying a ‚Äúcat in a bag‚Äù in his life.  We are Garmin, the first official brand stores in Europe. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Where can we find? </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80f/e89/3ca/80fe893ca12e3a9de333c06e0131d255.jpg" align="left">  Here, on Habr√©.  You can also visit <a href="http://nuvi.ru/">nuvi.ru</a> - this is our website, where all Garmin product samples, our news, promotions, and seminar announcements are presented.  There is also a forum there, so if you have questions, you write, we love answering them.  Our stores can also be found in large shopping centers - from August 2010 in the Garmin brand store in the Capitol shopping center, and since November in the Garmin store in the Gagarinsky shopping center. <br>  Why do we need shops, because it is more convenient to trade from a network?  Not exactly - we do not trade, we supply, service, support, exchange and do dozens of operations with navigators and GPS receivers, so it‚Äôs important for us to know the face of our customer, and it‚Äôs important for him to be sure that he can always find us to the address where the device was purchased.  So - come on, we will be happy.

    <h2>  What we have interesting </h2><br>  The most interesting thing with us is Garmin.  We know that in many ways this word has already become a household name, but, like no other, we understand how much it can mean.  And we want to talk about it, in fact, for this and started this blog.  What will be here - equipment reviews, comparisons, news, reviews of events related to us and you, and there will be contests, descriptions of discount programs, stories and articles - in general, everything that is interesting in our World of navigation. <br><br><h2>  What do you have interesting </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/282/587/eb4/282587eb41c7878992070f3ef14bf5d7.jpg" align="right">  What is so interesting about you?  We, for the most part, are managers and engineers, but who better can tell you about the device for an athlete - an engineer or stayer-marathon runner?  And who can better tell about the tourist navigator - a manager or a climber with 20 years of experience?  We understand this, and we have a suggestion: we allocate 5 different devices that can be taken from us ‚Äúfor a try‚Äù;  if you are a mountaineer - we will give you a new model for tourism, if you are an experienced cyclist, we‚Äôll give a bicycle navigator, if your vocation is a walking race, we‚Äôll give you a navigator with a pedometer, if you are a speleologist, then we‚Äôll probably give nothing but talk to you.  From you we need a feedback on how the device works, whether it meets expectations, for what purposes it is suitable - in a word, everything that can be included in the product review for your like-minded people.  While we cannot select more than 5 devices, therefore, if the device that suits you is tested, you will have to wait for it to return;  but to see, touch and try how our equipment works, you can always in our store together with our managers. <br><br><h2>  Garmin Community </h2><br>  Can Garmin bring people together?  We think it can.  That is why we have been preparing for two years to open our stores, develop designs, launch projects on the Internet.  We wanted to create a community of people united by a common idea - an interest in positioning, the latest achievements in this field, space technologies interested in a healthy lifestyle and setting goals in life.  What could be the pilot, the driver, the polar explorer, and the combiner?  All of them may have a navigator, and our task is to make it so that there is where to discuss it and where to get quality support and service. <br>  We are working to create such a service, where all people who share our values ‚Äã‚Äãcould quickly receive the necessary information, exchange views, update software and cartographic software.  We are working on this, and we will write about how this project is progressing here - we hope it will be interesting. <br><br><h2>  What will happen next? </h2><br>  Then we will keep this blog, where we will write a lot of interesting, both for you and for us.  We will communicate with you on the forum, revealing the questions that you have.  We will actively meet on social networks, because we are already quite possible to be friends on Facebook and facebook.  We will hold training seminars that will allow us to discover many new things already in seemingly thoroughly studied devices.  We will always be glad to see you in our stores - of which soon will be more, not only in Moscow, but throughout Russia.  Together we will be interested. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116557/</a></p>
