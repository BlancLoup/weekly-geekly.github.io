      In fact, such a scheme is correct in a very limited number of cases for the following reasons: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  it is necessary to make a preliminary call in order to clarify the quality of the product, its availability in stock, the composition of the service, etc .; </li><li>  if it is a complex product or service, then a series of calls is needed to discuss an individual decision, the terms of the transaction and the subsequent support or cooperation. </li></ul><br><h2>  The number of calls begins to grow when the client has doubts </h2><br>  The situation when your client is 100% sure that he really needs to buy a product or service is ideal.  Most often, we are faced with people who are not sure of their choice.  They may doubt the reasonableness of the price, the desire to buy this particular service or product, it is from this company, and not another, etc.  There are a lot of such ‚Äúbut‚Äù. <br><br>  For these customers need a phone number on the site.  When the user does not have enough chat or e-mail correspondence to resolve his internal doubts and make a decision.  He needs a lively contact to ask all the exciting questions, hear the manager's unprepared reaction and evaluate how important these nuances are. <br><br>  If we are talking about an expensive product or service, then the negotiation process is also bureaucracy, weighing all the pros and cons, lengthy negotiations on the price and terms of the deal, risk assessment and setting deadlines. <br><br><h2>  Want more conversion - prepare your sales department for new call volumes </h2><br>  If you just want to sell your product or service to a limited audience that is interested, then calls will be 2 or 3. When marketers have the task of increasing conversion, and the sales department has sales growth, the number of telephone calls will increase exponentially. <br><br>  For the successful conclusion of the transaction, it is necessary to overcome objections and doubts, which may take time.  If the client is large, then you should be patient and, perhaps, even select an individual specialist for negotiations and conducting the transaction.  Alexander Ringostat, Alexander Maximenyuk, <a href="http://www.marketing.spb.ru/lib-comm/dm/calltracking.htm">explained</a> in detail in his article Ringostat how to resist customer objections. <br><br>  In order to intelligently distribute the load, it is enough to track the load peaks of managers on the processing of incoming calls.  Outgoing calls from managers in order to increase conversion and sales should be planned during periods when the least amount of incoming phone calls. <br><br>  The screenshot shows the distribution of the load on the sales department by days of the week and time of day from the virtual PBX of the Ringostat service, which shows the number of calls to the company during each hour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/b4d/390/b0c/b4d390b0cfbeced494bd49b134aa47c1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  What they say intermediate survey results </h2><br>  In the areas of services such as an event agency or internet marketing agency, you need from 3 calls and more.  This is due to the fact that each service requires clarification of a large number of details, intermediate correspondence, etc. <br><br>  At the same time, a web development specialist needs one call, since it is limited in the number of projects that can be worked on at the same time and is not interested in a large number of orders.  The same approach is used in a small online store selling dishes.  There, sales take place through the site with confirmation via telephone, and the need for a longer chain only arises for expensive sets. <br><br>  I wonder how things are going to make deals in your business, how important are the calls in your sales funnel and how much time you usually spend on one customer.  We are sure that your experience can help someone to adjust their sales model, and you can get useful feedback.
