      We are very easily provoked, easily irritated by the opinions of others, by some trifles, distracting ourselves for what we are in this ecosystem.  Positive from such communication does not remain.  Remains ordinary and the feeling that again someone is wrong in these yours. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's be honest: for what you are more willing to put a plus sign: for a funny picture in a topic or for a really useful comment that the author found appropriate to add to upd?  And even more honest? <br><br>  I wonder if there are statistics on the number of plus signs set for comments?  I am sure that most of the advantages are given not for the ‚Äúbest answer‚Äù, but for Lulz.  So what's the deal?  We appreciate the "cool"?  So habr is not a fishnet! <br><br>  It is worth noting another observation: for example, a certain habraude Foo added a comment to Foo.comment, for which he received a number of ratings for comment A and for karma B. So, we can not but worry about the trend: abs (B) &gt;&gt; abs (A) for A, B &lt;0, and B ‚Üí 0 for A&gt; 0. In this case, A * B &lt;0 is extremely rare.  So, for bad comments, we fiercely minus in karma, for good comments, we put a plus sign to the comment.  What is it like?  Is this an objective assessment of what has been done?  What kind of hate in our heads? <br><br>  Recently, I provoked, unwittingly, a strange offtopic thread in one of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/142425/">topics</a> .  And he was the longest in this topic.  Wait wait what ??  Do we get what srach means more to us than the topic itself?  o_O Strange, is not it? <br><br>  The opinions of people are very divided, as far as I could trace it by the activity of chiselling on karma: 5 minuses (thanks for the opinion) and 2 pluses (thanks for the opinion).  Those.  people were not too lazy to go to my profile and put their assessment.  So, the motivation is quite serious.  And people still do it! <br><br>  Moreover, more importantly, <b>opinions are divided</b> !  This is wonderful!  So we have something to discuss. <br><br>  So, corrected the author, got it for his long profile and will not calm down in any way - you will say.  What I want to show from this situation: I do not understand where the human positive has gone?  Why was the thread the longest?  Why exactly this has touched readers?  And why did I, damn it, rush to correct Alizar himself outside the PM?  A message about a new topic came running to Twitter, there was an error in it.  Maybe I do not remember what - I thought and googled the word "honored": in the first place was exactly the specified topic from Habr.  It seemed to me worthy of universal attention, since even Google brings it to the first place. <br><br>  I wrote about the error because I do not care for errors in the headers.  People answered me because people care about such comments.  There were also those who care about the comments on the comments.  Further interest, as far as I noticed, exponentially falls.  Why does malice appear at the junction?  Mentality?  Spring depression?  Why do we communicate in unpleasant tones? <br><br>  We are angry that someone is doing something wrong.  Why do not we ignore nonsense, and cling to them with an iron grip until complete eradication?  We are a positive IT-community or the order of the Knights Templar, carrying the cleansing of Habr from the wrong-minded? <br><br>  That he again about this positive - you say.  Let's give an example from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">the well-known community</a> : <br>  I decided to somehow help the person than I know and can.  Has helped.  Nakosyachil.  2 guys with 20k + and 8k + reputation without saying a word, they themselves corrected: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/334/fd1/209/334fd1209bd0b5e28d770b967623d6ce.png"><br><br>  It was nice.  I nakosyachil, they corrected, not steaming because of this.  Because they care about the quality of the content.  Because they have to do with the ecosystem of the community.  I consider this a good example. <br><br>  Unfortunately, there is a parallel with the general situation in our life.  Echoes of devastation in the minds necessarily come to the self-governing community.  We are constantly proving something to someone, once again emphasizing self-doubt.  Feet under your feet, others under your feet.  What's next?  Some Friday lulz and Nazi screams that it has already been discussed?  Is it not the ability to think in advance, the ability to expand and equip our comfort zone, we emphasize each time comparing ourselves with ‚Äúeveryone else‚Äù and that such as ‚Äúthey‚Äù have to be thrown from here.  And what's the point? <br><br>  In general, I suggest thinking about our ecosystem in the long term.  Let's voice what worries us and what we don't like.  Not that this community, spoiling that you can forgive yourself. <br><br>  <b>Upd:</b> <br><br>  By aggregating the following in the comments, I want these conversations not to pass without a trace.  We came to the conclusion that the habr self-regulation mechanism is based more on emotions than on logic, which means it is purely subjective.  Topics whining about the spoiled Habr some besyat, and some agree with this.  Both opinions emphasize that the problem really exists.  I do not know such a way to solve problems like silence.  Let's discuss them, let's solve them together.  Some people asked me: Do I really believe that we can improve our society?  Yes, I believe it.  And I do not want to close my eyes.  There are not so many of us to change something for the better. <br><br>  Special thanks to everyone who wrote my personal opinion to me in PM.  It is very nice that this means something to you. <br><br>  The biggest problem I see is the opinion ‚Äúthese are your problems‚Äù.  People, it is necessary with common sense to approach everything.  After all, everyone is pleased when it is possible to find help from society, and not to receive from it a charge of negative and self-doubt.  The value of such a society increases.  And it really becomes worthy of calling yourself progressive. <br><br>  It is very disappointing that people consider the same StackOverflow audience to be different.  But the majority admit that this audience is more pleasant and is always tuned to the user, and not against it.  We should not be left out of society, which we ourselves have created. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142489/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142489/</a></p>
