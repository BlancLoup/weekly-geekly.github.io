  <section class="page js-page"><h1>First of all, do no harm or three rules for creating public interfaces</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  From the translator: this article is of a general nature, not directly related to web design or UI, in particular.  Nevertheless, I think that these things must always be remembered. <br>  Many thanks to the translation by Ole @ <a href="http://twitter.com/OlgaTeslenko">OlgaTeslenko</a> </blockquote><br>  When we think about design, we usually imagine things that are <em>chosen because they</em> are designed or painted.  Vases, comics or architecture ... <br>  But it turns out that most of what we do or design is aimed at an audience that needs something else.  Design is important, but design itself is not the main thing.  Call it ‚Äúsocial design‚Äù ... <br>  Public design is created for people who need to fill out our tax form, work with our website or register with our hotel <em>, regardless of</em> how it was created, not because of it. <br>  In attempts to improve in the process of work, appearance and power, sometimes we just worsen the product, because we forget about the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù part of the social design.  If the user is not targeted or is not interested in the innovativeness of our design, we must step aside. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Rule 1: The more often the device is used by beginners, the more standardized the interface should be. </h2><br>  For example, a shower at the hotel.  Some samples of the most elegant, thoughtful design ever created by man exist in the form of handles and thermostats in the souls of hotels.  All of them are terrible, dangerous and take away valuable time.  Guests do not want to learn to re-take a shower, they do not want to scald, they just want the water to go, the right temperature, in the right direction, and with the necessary pressure.  The first time. <br><br><h2>  Rule 2: The most important question is who will be outside the circle of users. </h2><br>  A small ramp is better than a few steps if you have a choice.  The wider the circle of people in our sample, the better the choice is by definition. <br>  No one takes a shower with glasses, and yet <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/.a/6a00d83451b31569e2017c385e21ac970b-120wi">on a very similar tube</a> in the shower the description is often typed in the 12th size.  No, I'm not going to wear reading glasses in the shower. <br>  If people with disabilities, the elderly, or those who have not installed the latest version of the modern browser cannot use what you have created, then it does not deserve to be publicly accessible.

    <h2>  Rule 3: The best interface is no interface. </h2><br>  Outstanding design contains history.  It moves a product from one product category to another, increases sales, creates efficiency and, above all, adds beauty to the interaction. <br>  But he should not ‚Äúscream.‚Äù  Or mislead.  An experienced user, a person who chose your design consciously, based on their needs - such a user will appreciate the features and beauty that you have created.  But in public space, do not try to attract the attention of passersby to what you have created.  We have other concerns.  A good designer understands what is <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fdilbert.com%252Fstrips%252Fcomic%252F2013-04-05%252F%26amp%3Bsa%3DD%26amp%3Bsntz%3D1%26amp%3Busg%3DAFQjCNEYQkv_mQZmJ54MN1mPeRQGi1uRGg">important</a> . <br>  Do not refuse responsibility for excellent design in public space.  Do not settle for ineffective, banal or ugly solutions.  But at the same time, honor the rules.  Anyone can play in public, but creating a good design for a wide range of users requires real skill.  We are not talking about the design that we notice ... No, a design that improves everyday life and is the best for society. <br><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176593/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176593/</a></p>
