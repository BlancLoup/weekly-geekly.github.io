The device was created by industrial designers Martin Hreben and Ondjey Chotovinsky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p9/wd/_c/p9wd_cw8jneixzg1thdbnkpjeek.jpeg"><br><br>  The creators say that in addition to the aesthetic and experimental value of the sand was chosen due to its acoustic properties.  The prototype speaker appeared last year, this year the creators announced the start of sales of a small series.  Under the cat more about the new device, its characteristics, the creators and production technology. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  A bit about DEEPTIME </h3><br>  DEEPTIME is a bold project that combines a technology development laboratory and an industrial design studio.  As I already mentioned, the studio was created by developers Martin Hreben and Ondjey Chotovinsky, who had previously been active in the automotive industry, with manufacturers such as McLaren, Honda and Skoda.

      Probably, the experience of development in the automotive industry is the reason why DEEPTIME is especially attentive to the technical solutions, measured characteristics and the objective component of the fidelity of reproduction, which is a comparative rarity for the so-called.  designer acoustics. <br><br>  The main direction in the development of DEEPTIME is the combination of "organic design" and innovations in the field of 3D printing.  Ionic Sound System is not the first project of the studio; a small batch <a href="https://3dprint.com/5188/akemake-first-3d-printed-wood-speaker/">of wooden composite</a> was successfully designed and also printed. <br><br><h3>  Ionic sound system </h3><br>  The new speaker is a 2.1 system consisting of an active subwoofer and a stereo pair of passive satellites responsible for the MF - HF spectra.  The case and the maximum possible number of acoustically significant parts of the system are printed from sand using 3D inkjet printing technology, which is widely used to create molds for metal casting.  The printed elements were treated with hardeners and coloring pigments, which turned the fragile blanks into full-fledged resonanceless parts. <br><br>  Acoustic design is also non-trivial, as is the hull manufacturing method.  The subwoofer is made in the form of an impressive size of the stone, and the MF-HF section in its form resemble two large sea shells.  Without a doubt, the satellites' shape was based on the groundwork of the company's first project, since the columns printed from wooden composite were also made in the form of spiral shells. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tn/9n/9u/tn9n9ujvpp_olx90bbzfyzz8dmo.jpeg"></div><br>  The form chosen for the design of the satellites is not accidental, as they have a closed acoustic design.  In this regard, and also because of the modest (less traditional shelving) volume of the case, the speakers need something that will increase the volume.  This ‚Äúsomething‚Äù became the cochlear mouthpiece, which determined not only the acoustic features, but also the appearance. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/11/o9/hz/11o9hz926p8j7t6zeftwj3_ixws.jpeg"></div><br>  The subwoofer hull is also borrowed from a natural object and is made in the form of large cobblestone perforated by phase inverter ports.  A ‚Äústone‚Äù with rounded walls prevents the appearance of standing waves inside the enclosure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w8/6l/_w/w86l_wocwlhhune2q-zwxxg2kyi.jpeg"><br><br>  A separate acoustic load falls on the sand, because due to its antiresonant properties it became possible to implement such an ambitious project.  For example, the sound absorption coefficient of sand is on average 0.06, and for a porous material treated with hardeners, it is even higher.  At the same time, hardened sand due to surface irregularities has excellent sound dispersion. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ia/kq/ma/iakqmac9gxtybk5zvneddwhh5xc.jpeg"></div><br>  This combination of properties, combined with the use of high-linear amplification and high-quality speakers, allows you to realize a result that is already impressive at the level of hardware measurements. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9g/ah/xf/9gahxf5atnvqnlqmrjtpp7kf37y.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Interestingly, in spite of the premium positioning, the system avoided the traditional audiophile techniques and what I call superstitious fears.  A high-performance class D amplifier was used, with the applied chip characterized by extremely low (especially for this class) distortion.  Other characteristics of the integrated circuit are also on par with decent Hi-Fi representatives from other classes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oe/fx/v3/oefxv3nhmgqbsxl-1wa3opuqvea.jpeg"></div><br><br>  The amplifier is powered by a pulsed power supply, specially designed for this system and eliminating the traditional problems with the possible appearance of high-frequency noise.  At the same time, the amplifier is capable of providing really high (for household polochnikov) RMS power - 80 W / peak - 160 W, which, with a sensitivity of 88 dB, allows us to develop SPL, sufficient for a full sound recording of 70-100 square meters.  The use of Bluetooth with AptX and AAC codecs allows you to get rid of the wires, without the risk of significantly worsening the fidelity of playback when playing with both Apple and Android devices. <br><br><h3>  Details on the characteristics </h3><br>  DEEPTIME compares favorably with many audio producers, including high-end companies with a strong bias in design - they write in detail about most of the significant characteristics.  Moreover, the information is given not in small print in the datasheet hidden in the far corner of the corporate resource, but on the official product page.  As people from the automotive industry, they describe in detail and in detail the significant TTH of the acoustics and the amplifier. <br><br>  So, the most interesting: <br><blockquote>  THUNDERSTONE subwoofer: <br>  Acoustic design: bass reflex with three ports; <br>  Materials: silicon sand, aluminum; <br>  Dimensions (D √ó W √ó H): 372 √ó 372 √ó 239 mm; <br>  Weight: 6.5 kg; <br>  Woofer: 5.75 "(4 Ohm); <br>  Frequency range: 40 Hz - 200 Hz; <br>  Sensitivity, 1W / 1m: 88 dB. <br><br>  THUNDERSTONE amplifier: <br>  Class D integrated amplifier with ultra-low THD + N harmonic distortion: 0.005% (1 W ‚Äì 25 W / 8 Ohm) <br>  Output power for satellites: 2 x RMS 30 W / BTL peak 60W; <br>  Subwoofer output power: RMS 55 W / PTBL peak 110 W; <br>  Power supply: Pulse unit AC 100‚Äì240 V, 50‚Äì60 Hz. <br><br>  SPIRULA Satellites: <br>  Acoustic design: closed case, spiral horn; <br>  Materials: silicon sand, aluminum; <br>  Emitter: broadband 3 "speaker with a bamboo paper diffuser; <br>  Frequency range: 75 Hz - 20 kHz; <br>  Nominal resistance: 8 Ohm; <br>  Sensitivity, 1W / 1m: 87 dB; <br>  Dimensions (D √ó W √ó H): 208 √ó 117 √ó 222 mm; <br>  Column weight: 2.4 kg. <br><br>  Switching: <br>  Audio input: Analogue 3.5 ‚ÄúStereo Jack; Digital 3.5‚Äú Fiber Optic Jack; <br>  Bluetooth: aptX &amp; AAC audio codecs; <br>  DAC: 24bit / 96kHz (High-Res); <br>  Wireless range: 10+ meters. <br></blockquote>  Special attention should be paid to the frequency response graph, which is also posted on the official product page without reserve, but without a detailed description of the measurement conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/do/mh/wl/domhwleb1ekgglmg1kscpibdszi.jpeg"><br><br>  The cost of this acoustics, like any other premium product - is high and amounts to 3,141.59 euros, which hints a little at the love of the creators of acoustics not only for money, but also for mathematics. <br><br><h3>  Total </h3><br>  In my subjective opinion, very much is interesting in the presented acoustics.  At the same time, I am convinced that many people will find the aesthetic qualities of the device controversial.  I suppose that this case, the code, the developers managed to harmoniously combine form and content, although many of my friends categorically expressed their opinion on the appearance of this speaker. <br><br>  I have not yet had the opportunity to hear this system, but judging by the measurements presented, it is capable of transmitting the recorded data with high accuracy, and in my opinion this is the main thing that the sound reproducing apparatus should do.  The cost is probably overestimated, mainly for ‚Äúrevolutionism‚Äù, ‚Äúelitism‚Äù and ‚Äúpremiumness‚Äù.  At the same time, I am glad that manufacturers honestly write about their product, indicating exact technical data, which does not always happen with companies from the High End segment.  As before, I would appreciate your opinion in the comments and participation in a short survey. <br><br>  <i>Jeans</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="https://www.pult.ru/">We</a> sell <a href="https://www.pult.ru/product/akusticheskie-sistemy--akustika-/">acoustic systems</a> , in our <a href="https://www.pult.ru/">catalog there</a> is no Ionic Sound System yet, but a wide range of other premium speakers is presented.</i>  <i>It is possible that the speakers described in the article will appear in our showrooms, with the keen interest of readers and the desire to buy it.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441520/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441520/</a></p>
