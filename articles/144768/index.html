And foreign rating agencies monitor publications in <i>their</i> publications and the number and duration of work at the university of <i>their</i> professors.  The higher the international rating, the more foreign <i>paid</i> students.  From current practice, the cost of education for a foreign student is higher than for a Russian.

      In the future, the minister plans to ‚Äúcompletely withdraw from free higher education,‚Äù which should open up new mechanisms for attracting qualified personnel to enterprises ... <br>  ‚ÄúIf a good education is expensive and the person is forced to pay for it, he will be able to take out a loan, and the future employer will pay it in exchange for obligations‚Äù (C) <br><br>  Of the "positive plans" - this is an increase in the cost of maintaining one student, <b>an increase in scholarships up to 10 tons.</b> <br><br>  And just the other day ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the continuation of the exam of the EGE, which started in Russian schools, it became known that such changes are planned for schools. <br><br>  Free education is offered to leave only up to the 5th grade.  Further free will remain only for 2 hours of mathematics and the Russian language, the rest is paid.  At the same time, it is planned to completely abolish the "compulsory" secondary education - if there are no funds to pay after the fifth grade, then there is no need to go for two free hours of mathematics and Russian, it is better to go to work.  And where to?  To the factory (if one can be found), to the market or a janitor. <br>  <i>As after such work, having earned the necessary amount for further studies, it will be possible to return to school ‚Äî it seems difficult.</i>  <i>Something like evening school for the builders of BAM, but also paid.</i> <br><br>  It is further proposed to transfer all teachers to a fixed small salary, and to make the motivational part insignificant. <br>  <i>Probably, to discourage unscrupulous teachers from school, who came there to quickly put together millions, and not children to teach.</i> <br>  At the same time, as always, <b>Russia</b> is divided between us in <i>Moscow</i> and <i>Russia</i> , since  the mayor of the capital promised not to take extra money from the Moscow teachers. <br>  <i>And teachers in the regions, well, something like this ...</i> <br><br><h6>  Note: </h6><br><h6>  The reasoning and conclusions about paid education in secondary school are made on the basis of information that has not yet been officially confirmed in the media, but according to the persons involved in the process.  There is no lobbying, no speculation or panic, just a cry from the heart.  The old <a href="http://okofinista.ru/vredonostnost_zakonodatelstvo_4.html">‚Äústuffing‚Äù</a> was not taken into account, although it was not written thoroughly.  <a href="http://www.onlinepetition.ru/sredobras8/petition.html">The petition is</a> now available in many educational forums, without idiotic advertising and SMS, which completely remains on the conscience of the author who posted the text of the petition on such a resource. </h6><br><br><h6>  Note 2: </h6><br><h6>  In the update below, the official position of the minister will be given on the arguments regarding the school, but it appeared much later than the article was published.  Therefore, I leave the text of the article unchanged. <br>  The words of the minister in tweeter put a few points on the "i" and a little encourage the school, but this is only a tweeter so far. </h6><br><br>  Before drawing some conclusions from what is happening, I want to remind you that in Germany, in Australia, and in many other countries, higher education is free if taught in the native language.  Applicants pay for study materials and make some contributions, but this is up to 1000 Euro per year. <br><br>  Now imagine how the events will develop further. <br>  I think everyone will agree that, as in the days of Lomonosov, the most promising specialists left us from the provinces (I don‚Äôt want to offend anyone). <br>  Now, through the methodical efforts of our chosen statesmen, this ‚Äúchannel of communication‚Äù with villages and villages is quickly covered up. <br>  Imagine a goal-oriented, young village resident (or urban-type settlement) who came to the bank for a study loan.  It is likely that in order to get a loan he will need to mortgage his apartment, go home (if he, the young one with a clear look and a fiery heart), owns the property. <br>  And as it is now accepted, the bank will be able to demand early repayment of the loan in the case of force-majeure, triples in the semester, for example ( <i>troechniki will not be taken to the nano-enterprise</i> ). <br>  Someone will try to argue that the guarantor of the loan should be the company, which in 6 years will work this young and qualified specialist.  Probably it should, but which company will take responsibility for the unknown nugget from the village "Kukuyevo"? <br><br>  There is no point in continuing to fantasize further on the topic ‚Äúwhat would happen if we ate‚Äù ... <br>  Utopia, the forced degradation of the poor, which is probably already 80% of the total population of our country. <br>  Preferences for foreign teachers in universities, <i>because they raise the rating, and our own only teach</i> .  And then it would be most logical for ours to go where they would teach, raising their own rating. <br>  Generations of young people not burdened with intelligence, with incomplete secondary and non-mandatory education.  And as opposed to them, the increasing flow of expats who receive education here and occupy all the vacant positions in enterprises on a preliminary contract basis. <br>  Senselessness for young school teachers to drag out of a patriotic motive a beggarly existence at school, and always be spat upon the fact that our <i>teacher is now a priori considered a bribe taker and a layperson</i> , while in a butcher‚Äôs shop you can trade in a 13-month teacher‚Äôs monthly salary of 13th grade. <br>  And in general, is it worth while having children, even one, or is it such a special.  project on the "capitalization" of maternity capital?  Why do we need to multiply, Rosseyans !? <br><br>  Utopia: <br>  - assume that money rules the world, that they can buy everything; <br>  - assume that on the click of a finger, millions of people will instantly cease to be moral, honest, compassionate, generous, intelligent and for an instant the magic wand will start correctly estimating financial plans for 30 years ahead, what loan for a child to take and with which company to agree on future work; <br>  - force people to stop being creative, impulsive, unpredictable, i.e.  to force someone‚Äôs <b>unsuccessful</b> image and likeness to cease to be who they are by their blood, those who are so afraid all over the world and who come to see themselves as gods from all over the world, to look at those who are not taken either by war neither hunger nor repression ... no reform ... <br><br>  May God grant us this ‚Äúreform‚Äù as well. <br>  Hope for this is still inspired by the <a href="http://m.gazeta.ru/social/2012/05/23/4597993.shtml">words of the Director of</a> one of the Chelyabinsk lyceums.  When a request came from a competent authority to provide information about the nationalities of students studying at the university, the rector answered without hesitation, ‚ÄúWe have one nationality - mathematics‚Äù. <br><br>  Update: <br>  <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/society/29/05/2012/652599.shtml">The most recent interview with the Minister.</a> <br>  The goals are quite noble, if we reject the very fact of global and one-time changes "We will destroy the whole world of violence to the ground ... and why?". <br>  It remains to determine the methods of achieving goals. <br>  I want to note that all statements are permeated by the financial component, and not social or demographic. <br>  And if I were not a convinced optimist, I would assume that there are queues in the children.  gardens will be liquidated on a paid basis ... <br>  However, I hope that all methods will be human, and ‚Äúpanic with paranoia‚Äù is absolutely unnecessary ... <br><br>  A small update on the links: <br>  1. <a href="http://xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8/2292">Minister's congratulations to graduates 2012.</a> <br>  2.

All together with music, work, art, drawing, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, it will not be possible to study, you have to pay for something. <br>  Music, work, drawing, drawing, astronomy, geography - generally disappeared from the objects mentioned as such. <br>  Congratulate yourself on the beginning of the reform, comrades! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144768/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144768/</a></p>
