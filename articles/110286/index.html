      So, in 2011 we are waiting for 4 big changes: <br><br>  1) The fixed fees for individual entrepreneurs are increasing from 12 to 16 thousand per year. <br>  2) Contributions to funds increase from employee salaries from 14 to 34% <br>  3) The reporting to the FIU for itself and for employees changes <br>  4) To report to the FIU will need to be more <br><br>  But the upper limit of the annual salary, from which contributions are charged, remained unchanged and still amounts to 415 thousand rubles <i>a year</i> .  In simple words, a <i>top manager of Gazprom with a salary of 500 thousand rubles a month and a programmer with a salary of 35 thousand rubles will bring the same amount of contributions to the budget of the Pension Fund of Russia</i> - 141 thousand rubles. <br><br>  Instead of raising contributions to 34%, it was enough just to double the upper limit of the annual salary from which the charges go, and the result would be the same only with the burden on large business. <br><br>  You can endlessly remember the notorious pig with your vehicle, but in reality there is a way out of any situation.  And real businessmen know it like no other.  Under the cat we consider three categories of business and describe how these changes will affect each of them.  Even under the cut a useful gift for business men is the calendar of Simplified people for 2011: when, what, where to pay and hand over. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Freelancers and SP without employees </h4><br>  This category can sleep peacefully.  Contributions are still deducted from the tax on the USN, no additional tax burden has appeared.  The only thing is that now it is necessary to report to the PFR on the paid contributions (1 or 2 times a year - not yet decided), there are no more changes. <br><br><h4>  Studios providing intellectual services </h4><br>  In the cost structure of a typical studio, the wage fund is usually more than 60%.  20% taxes and other expenses and 20% rate of return.  That is, with today's changes most studios from next year will work in the negative.  In order for the changes to be not so significant, it is necessary to make sure that the salary fund does not exceed 40% of the income, in this case, by deducting the tax from the STS, the amount of total payments for all taxes will be approximately equal to 2010. <br><br>  If we do not consider the issue of raising prices for studio services, then the only way to do this is to transfer all highly paid jobs for the staff to individual entrepreneurs. <br><br><h4>  Trade </h4><br>  Here you can‚Äôt transfer anything to the state.  If there is a ‚Äúindividual entrepreneur freelancer‚Äù behind the counter, then this is a red rag for the tax and labor inspection - this is by no means the case.  But, on the other hand, gray wages flourish in trade and the share of labor fund costs averages up to 30% of the total turnover, and since the contributions are written off from the tax on the simplified tax system, the average burden on trade will not increase significantly.  Merchants with a large turnover in the reality of this simply will not notice, just if the tax on the simplified tax system was paid before, then the same amount will go to the FIU. <br><br>  With regard to changes in reporting, it just became more, and while not completely clear its format.  But there is good news - from 2011 <a href="http://www.moedelo.org/">My Case</a> will send reports to the FIU and the FSS, and for all our users, these changes will pass smoothly - all reports will be generated automatically and sent to the regulatory authorities via the Internet. <br><br>  Therefore, if you look, everything is not so scary, and I am sure that in 2011 Russian small business will be able to continue to grow and develop.  After all, it is in this segment that people work who are capable of breaking through any walls of bureaucracy, difficulties and misunderstandings with their energy, intelligence and charisma.  It is the small business people who are able to solve unsolvable problems, find a way out of situations in which others lose, know what they want and pursue it purposefully.  Therefore, I am sure that we will cope with all the innovations together, and in 2011 everything will be great.  Employees will work, clients will bring money, debtors pay back debts, and controlling authorities will pass by without looking at the conversation! <br><br>  Promised <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/2138905/USN%25202011.pdf">calendar USN for 2011</a> . <br><br>  Success and prosperity to all businessmen in 2011!  We love you and are always ready to help. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110286/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110286/</a></p>
