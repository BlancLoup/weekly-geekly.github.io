  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Airplane, HD FPV, link 600 km 4G</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In continuation of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/virt2real/blog/223145/">yesterday's topic about the machine</a> . <br><br>  On a typewriter great ride, but the appetite comes while riding - I wanted to fly.  Of course, over Peter, driving from Moscow.  Yes, Habr will forgive me, but the plane is much cooler than the machine, so it deserves a separate topic. <br><br>  In <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/realizator/" class="user_link">realizator</a> just has a plane Bixler, especially for experiments.  The airplane already experienced, successfully survived a lot of carrots.  For those who are not in the subject - a carrot is such a figure of aerobatics, when the plane is stuck in the nose with the nose.

The implementer installed on Bixler (which, by the way, has the nickname ‚ÄúKashchei‚Äù, for the immortal) the same kit that stood on the machine.  Added one channel (for aircraft, at least three PWM channels are required).  In my home, instead of the kurkovy automotive app, I connected the aircraft control equipment (the national Turning - Turnigy 9x).  The same command server, the same rudder screw - all without changes. <br><br>  The implementer went to the clearing on the outskirts of St. Petersburg, traveled side by side - telemetry from the side showed that Yota‚Äôs signal was much weaker than it was on Palace Square, but there is more and less video. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Checked the controls, flew.  More precisely, they tried to take off, but a little uncoordinated actions, so that the airplane immediately fell to the ground.  At the same time the tail broke.  But I usually do not use the steering wheel (which is on the tail), but it is not even connected to us, so we didn‚Äôt pay attention to it. <br><br>  We made another attempt and, hurray, hurray, it turned out to take off!  I made one circle above the clearing, after which I successfully landed the plane.  The broken tail fell off at the same time, but this was not a damage during landing - it was broken, so you can disregard it. <br><br>  During the flight, I didn‚Äôt pay attention to the short fading of the video at all - not before that.  And later, when I was already reviewing the recording, I saw that there really were drops and fading, but in the air it was not very critical with a calm flight and at a more or less high altitude. <br><br>  By the way, I have never flown on this plane, my plane (as it turned out) is not so powerful and I listen to the rudders worse.  So, in fact, flew on a new device for me.  Which, moreover, was not trimmed, the axis neutral was not properly set.  So a lot of factors have played about which we have forgotten absolutely.  But still - managed to fly and land! <br><br>  On the plane there is no electronics other than Virtulka.  She drives it all.  There is no stabilizer or autopilot.  But now it is quite possible to consider Virturilka as a candidate for the role of controller of the autopilot, and it is not worth carrying it on board only as a camera. <br><br>  After landing, we tried to take off another couple of times, but somehow I didn‚Äôt feel very good without a tail, or my hands started shaking completely.  :-) In short, the tail completely broke off.  But Kashchei is immortal, the Implementer will repair it again and then continue. <br><br>  Well, here's a video with today's epic flight.  The video was a long one, sorry, I wanted to shove everything that was filmed. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Oy9fqVSlnm4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500002,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiBrpstKmnnGzmEZtLQ3i8NwPBQOw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223183/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223183/</a></p>
