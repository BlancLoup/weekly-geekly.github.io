It just so happened, but this is not the topic of the current topic. <br><br>  Unfair spammers are twice wretches who are not hard to find: using the example of American Victorias Secret and Russian SoftKey.ru. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Victorias Secret is a major US retailer / clothing manufacturer (including underwear) for women with a profit of more than $ 3 billion (2006).  Serious office.  The attitude is not only frivolous, it is ridiculous: I communicated with an ordinary support employee and with his manager.  Oath assurances, a pack of apologies, correspondence for 3 weeks (first promised to turn off "tomorrow," then the manager said "within 14 days").  Throughout the correspondence with enviable regularity spam fell into the mailbox.  Ho and now there, I stopped writing them.  I wrote to the hoster (a large office in the USA) to abuse all correspondence logs and headers of letters - in response to silence.  So, Victoria's Secret was the first sign of an emerging trend.

      Softkey.ru is ‚Äúone of the leading players on the Russian market of licensed software,‚Äù has been operating since 2001.  Stop fifty years ago, when the traffic compressor service was still relevant - I made a month order for the traffic compression service via SoftKey.  And I honestly signed up for the newsletter - I wanted to be aware of discounts and special offers.  With the full transition to free software, the need has disappeared and I have followed the instructions for unsubscribing from the mailing list (write a letter with the subject unsubscribe to the desired address).  Actually, nothing happened, but from that moment on, instead of emails, spam went (unwanted mailing - I clearly indicated my desire <i>not to receive emails</i> ), SoftKey simply ignored requests.  Not lazy, went to the profile, looked at the list of mailings - empty. <br><br>  So, both online stores have tools a) automatic unsubscribe from ‚Äúspam‚Äù, b) support service.  From both tools no sense, spam continues to crumble. <br><br>  Conclusions in connection with the above: <br><br>  1. There is a trend towards the preservation of dead souls by honest market participants.  The only logical explanation is to trick its owners / investors in order to get good reports. <br><br>  2. Spam is becoming a standard business practice. <br><br>  3. Hosters "close their eyes" to outright spam.  <s>Under Putin, this was not a</s> few years ago, this was not at all.  According to the complaint about any resource that sends spam, the hoster‚Äôs iron hand automatically shrank on the site owner‚Äôs throat.  At the direct request of the most arrogant resource owners were turned off until the causes were clarified and the address was deleted from the list;  after which the site was ‚Äúlaunched‚Äù again. <br><br>  Actually two eternal questions: who is to blame and what to do? <br><br>  ps.  Yes, I am able to configure mail as it should.  Speech in the topic of something else. <br>  ps.  I have already 10 companies in my collection that do not unsubscribe from mailings. <br>  ppps  At Habr√© there is SoftKi.  I would like to listen to excuses (for example: the lightning hit the server, the support service went on strike, everyone went to the front, ‚Äúthe fool himself‚Äù). <br><br>  Update April 14, 2010: <br><br>  Someone from SoftKey, obviously having read the post on Habr√©, gave the case a turn.  As if by chance from my letter, they made a ticket in the support system (after almost a week), and wrote a personal message here.  In both cases, as a result, apologized.  Why this happened, the answer was not given;  from a technical point of view, as I was informed, the following could have happened: ‚Äúthe base itself could not be refreshed, or refreshed, but not completely.‚Äù.  Apologies are accepted, of course, but if a post on Habr√© is required for solving a trivial question, then I simply have no words.  By the way, gentlemen from SoftKey, can you look for specialists at Habr√© who can update the database quickly and immediately by 100%? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90715/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90715/</a></p>
