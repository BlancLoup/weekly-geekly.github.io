The main value of any blogger is his audience.  The number of subscribers, hundreds of thousands of users, speaks not only about the popularity of the video blogger, but also about its impact on its audience.  People are interested in his opinion, they listen to him. </p><br><p>  The advertising market for bloggers is still little used.  Most marketers do not seriously consider such an opportunity to effectively advertise their company and have never worked with video bloggers. </p><br><p>  Honestly, there is not so much detailed and accurate information on this topic, despite the fact that we, as viewers of Youtube, very often see various advertisements and bright commercials in their stories. </p><br><p>  Our web studio decided to use this opportunity for its advertising campaign.  We started collecting the necessary information and studying the tools for convenient and profitable work with video bloggers.  But, indeed, there are not enough statistical and analytical reviews on this topic, and marketers of large companies that use this resource fruitfully for advertising do not seek to share their experience. </p><br><p>  In early March, we decided to try to order ads from bloggers on Youtube. </p><br><h2>  Agencies </h2><br><p>  There were not so many big advertising agencies for Youtube bloggers: <br>  <b>Zagency, Wild Jam, Socium, The Players, TAG, Hype Agency</b> and a few more. </p><br><p>  Most agencies have exclusive contracts with bloggers.  This contract requires the blogger to work only through the agency.  Not all bloggers are interested in working under such an agreement, therefore agencies have a small list of offers. </p><br><p>  The main advantage of the agency is a high level of creativity and management. </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Online exchanges </h2><br><p>  The exchanges are ready to cooperate with bloggers who have less than 100,000 subscribers, which is very convenient with a limited budget.  The principle of work with all exchanges is about the same.  The advertiser registers and gets access to the bloggers directory. <br>  Then you can choose the blogger you need by the required parameters, which can be set in the filter, or you can create an advertising campaign for which bloggers can send in their offers. </p><br><p>  When an advertiser chooses a blogger, the exchange offers a secure transaction service so that the advertiser gets the result and the blogger gets paid. </p><br><p>  We compared the exchanges and made a brief overview of several that we liked. </p><br><h3>  Prolog.yt </h3><br><p>  Convenient search in the base of bloggers, a large number of convenient filters, such as: the ability to select the audience of a blogger (country, age).  In the service, you can create advertising campaigns and conduct secure transactions. </p><br><h3>  Qaazqaaz.com </h3><br><p>  Search in the base of bloggers without registration, but there is no filtering by type of blogger audience.  The service does not have the ability to conduct a transaction, so you have to interact with bloggers directly, you have access to blogger contacts. </p><br><h3>  Comparison of exchanges: </h3><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Exchange name </td><td>  Number of bloggers <br>  Youtube </td><td>  Bloggers with an audience of more than 30 thousand. </td><td>  Registration for access </td><td>  Secure transaction </td></tr><tr><td>  Prolog.yt </td><td>  4500 </td><td>  970 </td><td>  check in </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Qaazqaaz </td><td>  560 </td><td>  410 </td><td>  Not required </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  Plibber </td><td>  1200 </td><td>  Filter did not work </td><td>  check in </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  EPICSTARS </td><td>  2210 </td><td>  600 </td><td>  check in </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Vlogster </td><td>  850 </td><td>  400 </td><td>  Not required </td><td>  - </td></tr><tr><td>  FPS hunter </td><td>  360 </td><td>  21 </td><td>  check in </td><td>  + </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>  Personal experience </h2><br><p>  We decided to make the budget for testing no more than 15,000 rubles, so we immediately excluded the agencies.  It took us several days to search for suitable video bloggers.  To do this, use the service <a href="http://www.qaazqaaz.com/">qaazqaaz.com</a> , which allowed without registering to see the catalog of bloggers, find out their statistics and contact information. </p><br><p>  For our topic the most suitable category is entertainment.  We selected 10 bloggers with whom we were ready to work. </p><br><p>  Then it was necessary to determine the type of advertising, it turned out, a large number of them: </p><br><ul><li>  Preroll - advertising at the beginning of the video; </li><li>  Integration - advertising in the middle of the video; </li><li>  Postroll - advertising at the end of the video; </li><li>  Mentioned in the video; </li><li>  Link in description; </li><li>  Link in the header of the channel and a number of other features. </li></ul><br><p>  We considered several types of advertising, including integration and a full review by the blogger of our services, but we could not find such an offer for the planned budget. <br><br>  We decided to dwell on advertising in the pre-roll format and placing the link in the description of <a href="https://www.waytostart.ru/">our site</a> . </p><p>  Some bloggers offered to make a video, but we did not like the quality of the examples offered.  Having studied the proposals of experts on freelance, we realized that it would be better to develop the idea and concept for the video recording ourselves and then give it back to work. </p><br><p>  As a result, we got a good and dynamic video for at least 15 seconds: </p><br><p>  <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DrEeWj051uBg">Watch our video</a></b> </p><br><p>  Sending all materials to video bloggers by email, we received a response from only four, the rest simply did not get in touch. </p><br><p>  It was possible to coordinate advertising with two bloggers with the number of subscribers of more than 20,000 people.  The total cost of the advertising company was 12,000 rubles. </p><br><p>  In the first week, the number of video views was 5,000 people on two youtube channels.  The site was visited by more than 250 people from youtube, the number of requests from them was 9. The development contract was concluded with three clients. </p><br><h3>  A few recommendations: </h3><br><p>  <b>Subscribers activity.</b>  When choosing a blogger, pay attention to the activity of its subscribers, it is well displayed in likes and comments.  Views and subscribers are very easy to cheat for the channel. </p><br><p>  <b>Statistics.</b>  Information on each blogger, including detailed statistics can be viewed on this service: whatstat.ru. </p><br><p>  <b>Like and Dislike.</b>  Channels with a large number of dislikes should be avoided, this moment may indicate that the channel has uninteresting content, and users have been screwed up. </p><br><p>  <b>Payment.</b>  Bloggers work only on a prepaid basis, citing the fact that a creative person does not have time to remind them of timely payment. </p><br><p>  <b>Suggestions.</b>  In the market, it is really possible to find cheap offers (possibly ineffective)  I found offers in which the cost was only a few rubles. </p><br><p>  <b>Exclusive video.</b>  The most expensive advertising format is shooting exclusive video.  Not all bloggers can do this because of the specifics of the channel, as well as the possibility of a creative idea. </p><br><p>  <b>Budget.</b>  With a budget of 20,000 rubles per video clip, you can afford to place a preroll from a huge number of bloggers.  At the same time, the cost of one ad viewing on average will be around 30 kopecks.  Top bloggers do not count. </p><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br><p>  As it turned out, advertising is quite effective.  We received four clients in the first two weeks of the advertising campaign.  Accordingly, we paid for all our costs and were able to earn a little.  In the future, we plan to use this channel of advertising, but already try to more effectively select video bloggers to advertise our services. </p></div>
