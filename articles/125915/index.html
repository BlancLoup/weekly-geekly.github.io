      Motivation can give you a lot of energy when you start something new.  But the problem is that it tends to end.  After a few weeks of dieting or working hard on your business, it is very easy to feel dejected. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Do not give up </h4><br>  You have already achieved a lot - even if you still do not see it.  Try asking yourself three questions.  If possible, write down your answers - it is much more effective than just thinking about it. <br><br><h5>  How far did you go? </h5><br>  Take a look at the distance traveled.  What did you manage to achieve?  Maybe: <br><ul><li>  <b>Weight loss</b> : you lose 4 kilos and get healthy habits </li><li>  <b>Starting a business</b> : You wrote a business plan and read 3 books </li><li>  <b>Debt payment</b> : You paid part of the debt </li></ul><br>  Whatever you achieve, it is more than nothing.  Perhaps it took longer than you expected - but in the context of a lifetime, a few weeks is not such a long period. <br><br><h5>  Have you learned something during this time? </h5><br>  Sometimes, you concentrate on the final goal and forget that the process itself is important.  Even if you have not yet achieved the result you wanted, you can still find many advantages: <br><ul><li>  <b>Slimming</b> : you have learned a lot about healthy food, it helps you make the right choice of food </li><li>  <b>Starting a business</b> : you realized that your original idea for a business was a bit short-sighted, and you have the opportunity to return with a new plan. </li><li>  <b>Debt payment</b> : you find yourself spending a lot more than you thought on coffee and lunches </li></ul><br><h5>  What will you achieve even if you do not achieve the goal? </h5><br>  You may be afraid that you will never reach your ultimate goal.  But there are many reasons to continue.  For example: <br><ul><li>  <b>Weight loss</b> : you can not lose weight to the desired 90 kilograms, but even if you have lost weight to 100, it is still much better for health than your initial 120 kilograms </li><li>  <b>Starting a business</b> : Your business may not provide a good regular income, but it will still bring additional income. </li><li>  <b>Debt payment</b> : you can not pay all debts at once, but you have already improved your financial situation </li></ul><br><h4>  Reboot yourself </h4><br>  Hope you feel better already, and decide to continue.  Then answer yourself three more questions. <br><br><h5>  Where have you stalled? </h5><br>  Often it turns out that we face difficulties and stop.  It will be useful to realize where you made a blunder before continuing.  Maybe: <br><ul><li>  <b>Weight loss</b> : you have lost 4 kilograms in the first three months of your diet, but now it‚Äôs difficult to eat healthy foods </li><li>  <b>Starting a business</b> : you are ready to get customers, but do not know how to start </li><li>  <b>Debt payment</b> : you were shopping and spent money to pay off debt </li></ul><br><h5>  What are your next steps? </h5><br>  Often you stop because you do not understand what your next steps will be.  Try the following: <br><ul><li>  <b>Slimming</b> : Keep a diary, mark at what time you can eat junk food </li><li>  <b>Starting a business</b> : Brainstorm to find ways to get customers - for example, advertising in magazines, creating a website, etc. </li><li>  <b>Debt repayment</b> : Trim your spending for the next few weeks, avoid exorbitant spending in the future (maybe just cash in the store) </li></ul><br><h4>  Who can help you achieve your goal? </h4><br>  You may feel that you absolutely need to reach the goal alone - but this is not always the case.  There is nothing wrong with allowing other people to help you. <br><ul><li>  <b>Weight loss</b> : find a personal trainer who will help you to be motivated, or ask a friend to go for a run with you </li><li>  <b>Start a business</b> : Hire professionals to create a professional website for you </li><li>  <b>Debt payment</b> : talk to someone who handles money correctly and ask him for advice. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125915/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125915/</a></p>
