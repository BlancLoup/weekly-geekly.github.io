  <section class="page js-page"><h1>But isn't it time for Habr√© to create your own investment fund for interesting ideas?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ladies and gentlemen, kind all day.  Actually, a completely spontaneous idea - on Habr√©, on the one hand, there is an excellent <s>group of intellectual forces of the good and ready for decisive battles for the</s> professional community; on the other, many interesting ideas are constantly published (but requiring investments). <br><br>  There are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/">almost 300,000 of</a> us here, and the overwhelming majority somehow took place as specialists in their field.  I think that a considerable number of HabrasHites would have been interesting, among other things, to become investors in some publications, or simply, with the opportunity to help a little. <br><br>  But to pull apart (or in a small group) a serious project, as in finance, not everyone can.  But to throw off in a group, for example, for 100 rubles in an interesting topic, and in case of success - to receive (albeit 10 kopecks) every month, well, or simply donate them to a really interesting topic without thinking, I think it would be interesting <a name="habracut"></a>  .

      In principle, the most important thing for this idea to work on Habr√© is already there - a powerful and active community.  There are polls, there is by and large <s>well-established karma is</s> something that is not accepted to speak.  There are many experts in various fields who can easily give a very competent and independent assessment for the whole community. <br><br>  How do I imagine this in practice?  Trite and simple - for example, everyone who wants can drop a small amount into his account.  Technically, it is managed either by the owners of the resource, or by the users elected by the community - all we need on the resource for this is for a long time. <br><br>  A group of experts examines interesting ideas, which have gained good performance in publishing, and applicants.  Next is a discussion with them.  If they are interested in funding from the Habra community, they are listed on the vote.  The vote itself, for example, occurs once a month.  Only those who donated money vote :) The winner together with the Habra Foundation creates joint stock companies and starts working.  Well, having received funding, I undertake, for example, to report here once a fortnight to publications. <br><br>  How could this business start? <br>  - It was possible to conduct the experiment, starting stupidly with what Thematic Media did, would be special.  account for donations.  For example, with the condition - there will be n - we will start to create a fund, there will be less - we will spend on a new photo UFO and beer, more - we will <s>redeem Google</s> . <br><br>  It is clear that it is doubtful, but the same <a href="http://navalny.livejournal.com/">Bulk</a> on the creation of Rospil collected 3.8 million rubles for 12 days to fight with the Rapels.  At the same time, at least someone does not like the fight against Rapels, and we love everything new ideas that come to life.  :) <br>  What do you say? <br>  PS&gt; Yes, I know that this is about a small, and perhaps somewhat naive idea.  But in such a powerful professional community, it may well turn into something much more serious.  Personally, I am ready (if the owners of the resource support the idea) to make the first small contribution even now. <br><br>  Update1: while we were discussing, someone already offers <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/imobz/" class="user_link">imobz</a> as a solution: <a href="http://fundim.launchrock.com/">fundim.launchrock.com</a> <br><br>  Update2: At the request of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ncix/" class="user_link">ncix</a> added a vote to the topic: </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175385/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175385/</a></p>
