    <ul><li>  2 reports are devoted to non-technical topics - soft skills (emotional intelligence) and non-material motivation of staff. </li><li>  In the field of development, we will talk about data science in life sciences, diagnostics of the performance of .NET applications, containerization in the microservice architecture, and how to choose which way to work with data in the repository - ORM or SQL. </li><li>  The UI / UX topic will be covered by Accessibility and Harmony reports in UI component libraries. </li><li>  The history of testing in the condition of limited resources will be interesting not only for QA specialists, but also for project managers. </li><li>  Finally, a special guest of the conference will talk about the use of artificial intelligence in support programs for schoolchildren and teachers. </li></ul><br>  By tradition, in addition to lectures, we prepared activities and prizes for the participants.  And, of course, presentations and videos of speeches will be available on the event website. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  More about the reports: <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rr/ar/u2/rraru2ox-w2z-krtc_o5mddzuqu.jpeg">  <b>Effective methods of intangible staff motivation</b> <br>  <i>Natalya Kireenkova, Senior HR Manager</i> <br><br>  The ideal employee works a lot and efficiently, does not ask for extra payment, does not look at the party and comes to work with joy.  The ideal employer offers interesting tasks, generously pays for work, develops, teaches and cares for its employees in every possible way.  How to take into account the interests of both parties?  What makes an employee feel important, valuable, meaningful?  We will talk with you about the ways of non-material motivation and how we work with her in Arcadia. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oi/dk/pa/oidkpa9vq2htxs3fxwhri973b4c.jpeg">  <b>Performance diagnostics of .NET applications in production</b> <br>  <i>Dmitry Levchenko, Lead Developer</i> <br><br>  Performance analysis and application performance issues are usually solved during development and testing, but what can be done if the application is already deployed in the work environment and problems are found?  It turns out not so little.  The report focuses on what opportunities are available, how you can look for bottlenecks in the performance of .NET applications in production, where to start the analysis and what you can use.  Let's get acquainted with a number of techniques and utility PerfView. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u2/nr/wa/u2nrwau-qiiewyst7klpxkp8sce.jpeg">  <b>Testing under conditions of limited resources</b> <br>  <i>Natalia Suprun, Lead Tester</i> <br><br>  Work in a big project involves changing and optimizing the process.  In some cases, this leads to the restructuring of teams and a decrease in the number of testers in general.  In this report, using my project as an example, I will tell you how we managed: <br><br><ul><li>  save the load on one tester while reducing the total number of testers; </li><li>  Maintain the quality of the project with the constant growth of project clients. </li></ul><br>  This report may be useful for testers, automation, managers. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i5/4z/ny/i54znyvmoo7eaaodu57w80oolus.jpeg"><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bm/5s/qq/bm5sqqkwhio3snjuryzk1bg6038.jpeg">  <b>Where is the truth - ORM or SQL?</b> <br>  <i>Vladimir Kalskov, Senior Developer</i> <br>  <i>Ilya Rachinsky, Developer</i> <br><br>  Data storage is one of the most important components of software products.  Choosing a way to work with data is a fundamental factor in the development and support of the project.  The ORM approach provides a convenient interface for data manipulation.  But is the choice of ORM always justified?  Does the programmer need SQL or will DBA help him? <br><br><ul><li>  ORM - mo (d / f) but, SQL - well (d / f) but. </li><li>  Is the choice in favor of ORM / SQL always justified? </li><li>  How to compare?  What to compare? </li><li>  Simultaneous use of SQL and ORM. </li><li>  So D or F? </li></ul><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oh/cr/sh/ohcrsho7fye8f6zutu0j_t1w6do.jpeg">  <b>Accessibility.</b>  <b>Unlimited users</b> <br>  <i>Anna Kovtun, UX / UI Analyst</i> <br><br>  What is accessibility?  Who needs it and why?  How from the point of view of UX to make the content available and evaluate whether it turned out?  I am pleased to tell, show and answer all your questions. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xh/lo/sc/xhloscl01nalmfloqtxgjocweoy.jpeg">  <b>Microservices in containers - experience of use</b> <br>  <i>Roman Moiseyev, Developer</i> <br><br>  In recent years, microservice architection has gained great popularity.  This is largely due to the proliferation of containerization.  The de facto standard for container orchestration has become Kubernetes.  I will talk about how Kubernetes helps us to cope with microservices, what pitfalls and tricks are applied to microservices.  In particular: <br><br><ul><li>  The life cycle of microservice. </li><li>  Logs: what to log, how to collect and analyze logs. </li><li>  Monitoring and collecting metrics. </li><li>  Debugging and Troubleshooting. </li></ul><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5h/hh/o9/5hhho9iru5iwiv3cn2me1y2hjfg.jpeg">  <b>Emotional intelligence</b> <br>  <i>Andrei Kholyavkin, Head of Taganrog office</i> <br><br>  The most non-technical report at a technical conference is why we make important decisions with our hearts and how it helps and hinders work.  Emotional intelligence is as much a participant in the thinking process as the rational thinking mind that we are used to.  The better we focus on our emotions and the more ways we respond, the better we can cope with our lives, including in the process of work.  This is especially important when working in a team and in conditions of limited resources, because without the art of communication it is difficult to lead people. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pq/l7/z7/pql7z7blievf68lv14bkpilpnnc.jpeg">  <b>UI component libraries: from chaos to harmony</b> <br>  <i>Olga Fedoseeva, Senior Developer</i> <br><br>  Working on several similar business applications, we created a library of UI components.  In my report, I will share the experience of creating, developing and supporting this library: <br><br><ul><li>  Iteration 1: creating a UI kit, writing styles and creating components under AngularJS. </li><li>  Iteration 2: building a library of components under Angular5 (6).  Attempts to standardize not only the appearance, but also the behavior of individual elements. </li><li>  Prospects for the development of the library. </li></ul><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xj/b5/pq/xjb5pqaft0b9ougoxiupkv1rkq0.jpeg">  <b>Data Science in Life Sciences</b> <br>  <i>Vyacheslav Kotrachev, Senior Developer</i> <br><br>  Currently, life sciences (life sciences) - one of the most rapidly developing applied scientific fields.  Data science has also become very popular since the beginning of the 2010s - largely due to the increase in computing power of machines, on the one hand, and the growth in the amount of data in digital form, on the other.  I want to tell how the science of data helps the life sciences to make the world a better place: <br><ul><li>  what life sciences are and what they study; </li><li>  what data science is and what it does; </li><li>  how data science works in life sciences - and if it doesn't, then why; </li><li>  what problems of life sciences we solve in Arcadia with the help of data science. </li></ul><br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9n/vn/qd/9nvnqdf5tnnnrdlaqpfagzv8tas.jpeg">  <b>Artificial Intelligence Based Wellbeing Coach for Students (in English)</b> <br>  <i>Mikko Kylv√§j√§, Senior Development Manager in School Day</i> <br><br>  School day and Arcadia are developing.  It is necessary to improve and maintain the wellbeing in the school community.  He is also a researcher in the field of Wellbeing, Motivation and Health. <br><br>  To participate you must register on <a href="http://azov.developersmeetup.ru/">the conference website</a> .  Come, it will be interesting! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/424691/">https://habr.com/ru/post/424691/</a></p>
