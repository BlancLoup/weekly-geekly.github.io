"Mail" is profitable for the second year in a row.  Revenue increased by 6% and reached 149 billion rubles.  Faster than other areas, revenues from packages grew by 19%. <br><br>  Representatives of the state-owned company explain that it is possible to maintain profitability for the second year in a row due to a 3% reduction in production costs.  This year they fell to 26.6 billion rubles.  Pochta managed to optimize purchases and logistics. <br><br>  From 2013 to 2015, the cost of one conditional shipment decreased by 8.3%, or from 1.06 to 0.97 rubles, while the average monthly output per employee increased by 7% and amounts, according to the mail itself, to 39,600 rubles.

      In 2015, the number of international shipments continued to grow: <a name="habracut"></a>  for the year, the Post of Russia processed 128 million international mail - 64% more than in 2014, and three times more than in 2013. <br><br>  Revenue from financial services increased by 2% over the year, and by 4% from the postal business.  Income from the property complex increased by 5%. <br><br>  But parole business became the growth driver of revenue, which is connected with the growth of the market of international shipments, Timur Nigmatullin, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%2598%25D0%259D%25D0%2590%25D0%259C">Finam</a> analyst, said: ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù became the beneficiary of the e-commerce market growth, as the company manages the main supply chain from abroad. <br><br>  Largely due to the growth of international shipments, the rest of the Russian Post business segments also grew: an increase in traffic in post offices leads to an increase in revenue growth from other services, the analyst suggests. <br><br>  Pochta Rossii retains a monopoly position on the international correspondence market, occupying about 90% of it, President of the National Association of Distance Trading Alexander Ivanov <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/04/19/638194-pochta-rossii">told</a> Vedomosti, while the Russian Post domestic shipments segment did not show revenue growth.  But the market of domestic shipments fell by 20%, which means that Pochta Rossii increased its share in this segment, simply keeping the last year‚Äôs figure at the expense of new products, as well as cheap delivery, Ivanov said. <br><br>  In general, the share of ‚ÄúPost of Russia‚Äù in the mail market grew by 12 percentage points and amounted to 51%.  Pochta Rossii began to take away the lost share in the parcel market, Gazprombank analyst Sergei Vasin draws attention, the company is becoming more efficient and competitive, including in terms of delivery times and losses.  The Post of Russia managed to reverse the long-term trend, it stopped losing the market, he sums up. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300216/</a></p>
