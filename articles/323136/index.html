  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DataLine experience: how we prepare duty engineers for our data centers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Today we want to tell you how we select and prepare duty engineers for our data centers.  This position is important for us for two reasons: </p><br><ul><li>  This is our first line of technical support.  Attendants monitor the monitoring wall, communicate with customers who come to our data centers, help to install new equipment.  Their efficient work, friendly attitude to customers, attention to trifles mean for our service no less than the work of the infrastructure of the data center: exceeded the response time to the request, allowed to go to the data center without shoe covers, just did not say hello - minus our karma <br><br></li><li>  this is our ‚Äúforge of personnel‚Äù.  Some guys then grow to lead engineers of specialized technical groups and even to department heads. </li></ul><br><p>  But first things first. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a72/ee0/3b1/a72ee03b11de47c281c152c3ba6f8a85.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a></p><br><h2 id="chem-zanimayutsya-dezhurnye-inzhenery">  What do the engineers on duty </h2><br><p>  The engineers on duty have many tasks.  They work: </p><br><ul><li>  with clients: accompany them in the data center, help clients arrange deposit / removal of equipment, monitor compliance with the rules of behavior in the data center. </li><li>  with IT equipment: mark and register in the accounting system, prepare racks for installation, assemble and disassemble, reboot it, lay cross-connects. </li><li>  with engineering infrastructure: twice a day, visually inspect all the infrastructure facilities of the data center. </li><li>  with monitoring system: track alerts, record, resolve and, if necessary, escalate incidents. </li></ul><br><p>  In the day shift, depending on the data center, 6-8 engineers on duty and one senior engineer are on duty.  In the night - two people less. <br>  Engineers work on two schedules to choose from: 5 days a week for 8 hours or a day after three. </p><br><p>  The posts of engineers on duty are in the monitoring center.  The work is structured so that at least one person always follows the monitoring wall. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73a/d81/dad/73ad81dad0794fbf82689b7046da795d.jpg"><br><p>  <em>Post duty engineers of some of our data centers.</em>  <em>In total, the <a href="http://www.dtln.ru/tsod-ost">OST</a> site employs 19 people on duty, <a href="http://www.dtln.ru/tsod-nord">NORD</a> - 27 people.</em> </p><br><h2 id="kto-mozhet-stat-dezhurnym-inzhenerom">  Who can become a duty engineer </h2><br><p>  We prefer graduates and students of the last courses of technical universities.  Many come from the <a href="http://www.dtln.ru/tsod-ost">OST</a> MTUCI located next to the site, MSTU.  Bauman, MEI. </p><br><p>  Duty engineer - starting position.  In our experience, after a year of work, the engineer gets all the possible knowledge in this position, and in the ‚Äúduty room‚Äù he becomes bored.  At the same time, by this point he understands where to go next. </p><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Case of life </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  A few years ago a young guy came to our janitors, who needed at least some kind of work.  To go to the engineers, he did not have sufficient skills in IT.  But the guy was intelligent, quickly grabbed and he was interested in everything that happens in the ‚Äúduty room‚Äù.  Very soon, on his own initiative and with the permission of the elder, he began training on the site: he worked as a janitor early in the morning, and afterwards went to work as an intern.  A few months later, when he pumped all the necessary knowledge and skills, he was officially transferred to the position of duty engineer. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><p>  If the engineer proved himself well, possesses the necessary knowledge, and we have vacancies, then in a year or even earlier the engineer on duty can try himself in more senior positions.  It has the following options: </p><br><ul><li><p>  stay on duty as a senior shift engineer with the possibility of becoming a senior on the site. </p><br></li><li><p>  continue to work in the second line of support - specialized technical departments: maintenance of the engineering infrastructure, virtualization, network, Unix, Windows-groups. </p><br></li><li>  go into business areas - directorate of sales and service management, product development department. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ca/c33/3b1/2cac333b1fb54f6e87b0e069d2d44b35.PNG"><br><p><br>  Many of the current leading engineers and even heads of departments began their work in the ‚Äúduty room‚Äù.  Growing up with desire is possible, and we only welcome it.  Those who have gone this way are especially valuable because they know everything about operational processes and the design of our data centers.  Here are a couple of such stories. </p><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Kirill Shadsky, Head of External Data Centers Department </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  In 2010, Kirill graduated from MTUCI and joined the DataLine as an engineer on duty. </td></tr><tr><td>  In early 2011, he headed the support service, and in 2012, he headed the data center operations department.  In this position, he managed the engineering systems of the data center, reorganized the processes of operation, monitoring, repair and modernization of systems.  During this time, the number of DataLine data centers increased from 2 to 6. </td></tr><tr><td>  In 2014, Kirill and his team successfully passed the audit of the NORD-1 and NORD-2 data centers according to the standard of Uptime Institute Management &amp; Operations and received a record 92 of 100 points.  In 2015, he participated in the certification of the NORD-4 data center according to the standards of Uptime Institute Tier III: Design and Uptime Institute Tier III: Facility. </td></tr><tr><td>  Since the second half of 2015, he has headed the department for managing external data centers, conducting <a href="http://uni.dtln.ru/">training seminars</a> on the engineering infrastructure of data centers. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Grigory Atrepiev, Head of Project Management </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  Grigory graduated from MTUCI and joined the company in 2009 as a network engineer on duty.  He took part in the modernization and development of the core of the network infrastructure of data centers, introduced telephony and contact center systems. </td></tr><tr><td>  In 2011, he headed the network department, completed the construction of fiber-optic communication lines between network points of presence, upgraded DataLine network equipment at MMTS-9 and MMTS-10. </td></tr><tr><td>  From 2012‚Äì2014, he held the position of production director: he was responsible for the work of the technical departments, the operation of the data center, the work of technical support. </td></tr><tr><td>  Since 2014 he has headed the project management department.  His team develops the architecture for non-standard complex projects based on the virtual and physical capacities of DataLine, solves the problems of migration from external data centers and third-party services, organizes support for the infrastructure of client information systems, conducts audits. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Alexey Bagaev, Head of Network Department </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  In 2009, Alexey came to the position of duty engineer. </td></tr><tr><td>  In 2010, he moved to the network department, where he was involved in the administration of VoIP services and in organizing the reservation of client connections. </td></tr><tr><td>  In 2011, he occupied the position of senior network engineer. </td></tr><tr><td>  Since 2012 heads the network department.

In 2015, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/dataline/blog/317122/">DataLine-IX</a> launched its own traffic exchange point. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Alexey Shuvalov, Head of Financial Sector </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  Alexey began working in DataLine in 2011 as an engineer on duty.  Six months later he became a senior technical support engineer. </td></tr><tr><td>  In 2012, Alexey moved to the service management department for the position of junior service manager. </td></tr><tr><td>  In 2014, he took the position of lead service manager. </td></tr><tr><td>  Since the spring of 2016, Alexey has been leading the financial sector. </td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2 id="kak-prohodyat-otbor-i-stazhirovka">  How are the selection and internship </h2><br><p>  From the moment of sending a resume to enrollment, it takes from 1 to 3 months, depending on starting knowledge and skills.  During this time, both we and the candidate himself will understand whether we are suitable for each other. <br>  The candidate‚Äôs path to the rank of ‚Äúduty engineer‚Äù is as follows: </p><br><p>  <strong>qualifying round - 1 day;</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>introductory study and exam - 3 days;</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>paid internship - 1-3 months;</strong> <strong><br></strong>  <strong>enrollment in the state.</strong> </p><br><p>  <strong>Qualifying round.</strong>  All whose resumes seemed interesting to us are invited to the qualifying round, which is conducted by experts from the HR-department.  At this stage, we meet with the candidate and acquaint him with our company, future responsibilities, opportunities, conditions for salary.  No less detailed and honestly talk about the difficulties of the position, so that the future engineer understands what he will have to face.  After a short story about themselves, candidates are tested in combat conditions: they decide cases that are as close to reality as possible.  Here is an example: </p><br><p>  A service manager is writing you a letter asking you to connect an additional rack for the client.  There is no official confirmation from your manual.  Today is Friday 7:00 pm, your shift ends at 9 am on Saturday, and work must be delivered at 12 am on Saturday.  Your actions? </p><br><p>  From the candidate is not required unambiguously correct answer.  Moreover, it is proposed to solve the problem jointly.  At this stage, it is important for us to understand how he is guided when deciding whether he has enough self-control (is it not rude, not falling into a stupor).  Another important point for us is the ability to work with other people.  There are always several people on duty in the shift, so it is important for us to understand how quickly and well the candidate finds a common language with his colleagues. </p><br><p>  Together with the invitation to the qualifying round, the guys receive instructions on the simplest and most frequent operations in the data center: compress the twisted pair, configure the IP KVM, remove logs from the PDU, etc.  Understand them and understand what's what - a kind of homework.  At the interview you need to do everything yourself, if possible without instructions and hints.  Here we also check not so much technical knowledge as the responsibility and learning ability of the candidate.  Here in the photo below, someone is engaged in business, and someone smokes bamboo, because he was not prepared at home. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc3/821/cb0/dc3821cb037244f78c64d68e2da9801d.JPG"><br><p><br>  Basic technical knowledge is verified during a separate test.  If the candidate does not understand what TCP / IP is, what a DNS server is for, what are the parameters of the household current, then it will be difficult for him to be an engineer on duty. </p><br><p>  Points are counted immediately, the results are sorted out together.  All points are entered into a ‚Äúpersonal matter‚Äù, where they record all the results of subsequent exams and internships. </p><br><p>  <strong>Introductory training.</strong>  If the candidate has scored at least 21 points (70% of the possible), then he continues on his way and is invited to attend three-day introductory training. </p><br><p>  On the <strong>first day of the</strong> future, the engineer on duty is introduced to the values ‚Äã‚Äãand rules of the company, the organizational structure and colleagues you need to know in person, talk about buns in the form of corporate events and holidays. </p><br><p>  At the end of the first day - the first sightseeing tour of the data center, where they talk about the main functions of engineering systems. </p><br><p>  <strong>The second day is</strong> completely devoted to the functional duties of the duty engineer.  If before this was all in general terms, now the candidates analyze in detail the work with the monitoring system, the incident registration process, the regulations and instructions, the requirements for the processing time of requests for SLA. </p><br><p>  Using specific examples, they are told what operations their area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility is limited to and what incidents need to be escalated to the second line of support. </p><br><table><thead><tr><th>  Top 10 most frequent incidents in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãresponsibility of the duty engineer </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>  Work with equipment (replacement of hardware, installation of OS) </td></tr><tr><td>  Connecting and / or configuring KVM for a client </td></tr><tr><td>  Reboot equipment </td></tr><tr><td>  Switching equipment </td></tr><tr><td>  Installation / disassembly of equipment </td></tr><tr><td>  Works on SCS </td></tr><tr><td>  Marking equipment </td></tr><tr><td>  Visual monitoring (checking equipment operation upon request) </td></tr><tr><td>  Presentation of information at the request of customers </td></tr></tbody></table><br><p>  <strong>The third day is</strong> completely devoted to the engineering infrastructure of the data center.  The senior engineer of the site tells in detail about the main data center systems - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/dataline/blog/310356/">power supply</a> , cooling.  Using the example of one of the sites, candidates are introduced to equipment and systems, and they are told about their role in the work of the data center.  Future engineers will learn the principles of operation of industrial diesel power plants, UPS, air conditioners, chillers.  On the same day, they disassemble the rack types and for the first time try to install and connect the equipment in the rack. </p><br><p>  Also, the guys talk about the device network infrastructure. </p><br><p>  Emergency situations are dealt with for each system and equipment.  The main duty of the engineers on duty is monitoring, so they must understand how this or that problem will appear in the monitoring system and the main thing is what to do next. </p><br><p>  At the end of a three-day intensive, candidates pass an exam on theory and practice.  New material for these three days is a lot, and without practice it is difficult to assimilate everything to the end.  We are well aware of this, and at this stage it is enough for us that the candidate show a clear understanding of his duties and basic knowledge about the engineering infrastructure of data centers. </p><br><p>  All these three days the future leaders are looking at the guys.  They evaluate their ability to work in a team. </p><br><p>  Following the exam (you need to score at least 70% of the possible number of points), we decide whether to invite a candidate for an internship or not. </p><br><p>  <strong>Internship.</strong>  Paid internship under the training contract can last up to 3 months.  The trainee helps the current shift on duty and continues his training on an individual plan.  All this time a tutor has been working with him.  Usually this is a senior engineer shift.  He helps him to advance according to the plan of training.  For each item, the future engineer on duty passes a mini-test, and at the end of the internship a great exam. </p><br><p>  After the exam, the HR colleagues and the head of the support service again talk with the candidate to make sure that the candidate likes everything and still wants to work as an engineer on duty.  The mentor gives feedback and shares his observations on the trainee's progress.  If everyone is happy with each other, then the trainee is hired as an engineer on duty. </p><br><p>  This is an interesting and rich way that a person who wants to become a duty engineer in our data center passes. </p><br><p>  If you want to try your hand and get the opportunity to work in the largest commercial data center in Russia, send your resume to <strong>job@dtln.ru</strong> . </p></div>
