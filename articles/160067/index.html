      <br>
      For starters, I will introduce you to Alice.  Alice is a character who was invented so that communication with the Smart Home was, let's say, somewhat more humane.  Alice's personality, if I may say so, is simple enough, but, nevertheless, my three-year-old son perceives her exactly as a person, endowing her with those human qualities that, of course, do not exist in reality, but are sometimes imitated successfully - for example , care, courtesy, frugality. <br><br>  But back to our day ... So, a country house, a family of three, the beginning of the day. <br><br><blockquote>  00:51 Alice: I think no one is home ... <br>  00:51 Alice: Although most likely everyone is sleeping :) The night is in fact! <br>  00:51 Alice: Moving to economy mode <br>  00:51 Alice: The temperature is higher than desired, I close the heating valve </blockquote><br><br>  For several wireless motion sensors, the house monitors the activity of the inhabitants and, after some time without it, comes to the conclusion that no one is at home, or everyone has fallen asleep :) This event initiates the scenario of switching off unnecessary consumers (now it is a hot water boiler and the associated circulating pump) and also changes the settings of the desired temperature in the house.  The latter, in turn, causes the heating controller to cover the valve so as not to waste energy on unnecessary heating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d3f/96b/dd8/d3f96bdd8fe598f77dc58775af8f54c4.png" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  05:33 Alice: Internet is not available <br>  05:38 Alice: Internet access is provided </blockquote><br><br>  Unfortunately, the Internet in my home is only 3G, so that failures sometimes happen.  In night mode, this is just a record for the story and Alice does not announce such things to the whole house, although if there was some kind of emergency situation (for example, exceeding the permissible temperature in the heating circuit), then the notification would be at least spoken out loud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af9/b31/f7d/af9b31f7da27cd2f14db6bdf7b95afd3.png" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  06:30 Alice: Soon the hosts should wake up, warm up <br>  06:30 Alice: Exit saving mode <br>  06:30 Alice: Temperature is lower than desired, open the heating valve </blockquote><br><br>  At 6:30 there is a forced exit timer out of the economy mode - you need to take care of reaching a comfortable temperature in advance. <br><br><blockquote>  07:39 Alice: Motion detected. <br>  07:39 Alice: Good morning! <br>  07:39 Alice: Now 7 hours 39 minutes <br>  07:39 Alice: I also remind you of the missed tasks.  1. Take out the trash. </blockquote><br><br>  The alarm clock rang, and the awakening was detected by a motion sensor in the corridor.  In the bathroom I find out that, as usual, I forgot to take out the garbage yesterday.  The music started playing ‚Äî a random folder of favorites added to my media collection. <br><br><blockquote>  08:27 Alice: It should already be light ... <br>  08:30 Alice: The temperature outside the window is 3.3 degrees Celsius.  It seems to me rather cold.  Sunrise today at 08:57, sunset at 16:54. </blockquote><br><br>  Morning bustle, breakfast, fees.  In the meantime, we learn what is there on the street and how to dress a child.  Passing through the corridor, I take a look at the terminal screen - a nameless Android tablet, constantly turned on and showing basic information about the state of home systems, the weather, the temperature of the house, and the events that occurred.  The same information is available from any other device both at home and outside of it (the latter is locked with a password, of course).  Honestly, even though it‚Äôs all always and affordable, I like it more when you don‚Äôt need to go anywhere - once the house has been called ‚Äúsmart‚Äù, then, be kind, somehow, as far as possible, cope. <br><br>  Weather conditions, by the way, are monitored by such a weather station installed on the roof. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a49/5dd/7ff/a495dd7ffcdbe063df5569a94f64a7fa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I had to tinker a bit to get the data from her into the system, but in the end, Alice acquired additional senses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37d/78d/090/37d78d0903273d4388429cd4bf592c47.png" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  08:39 Alice: Attention!  Open the entrance gate. <br>  08:39 Alice: The gates will be closed after 1 minute <br>  08:40 Alice: The gate is closed. </blockquote><br><br>  Time to work.  We leave the house, start the car, open the home menu on the phone, select the item ‚ÄúTemporarily open the gate‚Äù, leave.  For some time I‚Äôm standing next to the house, waiting for the gate to close - the automatic did not let down, but, as they say, "safe ..." <br><br><blockquote>  08:57 Alice: The sun comes up <br>  09:00 Alice: It is now 9 o'clock <br>  09:05 Alice: Sergey left home <br>  10:46 Alice: Sergey drove to the office </blockquote><br><br>  Do you think you can get rid of the care of a caring Alice, leaving home?  No matter how wrong!  The phone periodically sends the owner's GPS coordinates to the home server and Alice watches someone where.  When you exit or enter a certain hot-spot, an event is triggered, to which you can somehow react. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31c/9c5/2ed/31c9c52eda2645b7f490e2d65ef583ef.png" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  10:00 Alice: It is now 10 o'clock <br>  10:16 Alice: I think no one is home ... <br>  10:16 Alice: Moving to economy mode <br>  10:16 Alice: The temperature is higher than desired, I close the heating valve </blockquote><br><br>  Alice discovers that she is left alone - why not economize a little while doing this.  By the way, in the first month of the economy test, I paid 30% less for electricity, so it makes sense. <br><br><blockquote>  11:00 Alice: It is now 11 o'clock <br>  12:00 Alice: It is now 12 o'clock <br>  13:00 Alice: It is now 13 o'clock </blockquote><br><br>  In the afternoon, Alice entertains herself with accurate time signals :) <br><br><blockquote>  13:35 Alice: Attention!  Open the entrance gate. <br>  13:35 Alice: Attention!  Opened entrance to the garage. <br>  13:36 Alice: Driving in the garage. <br>  13:40 Alice: Garage closed. <br>  13:42 Alice: The gates are closed. </blockquote><br><br>  The usual episode - I sit at work, my wife's brother calls: <br>  - Seryoga, I want to take you a lawnmower, will you open the garage? <br>  - Yes, come, of course. <br><br>  A few minutes later he calls and informs that he has arrived.  I launch the ‚Äúhome‚Äù page from the working computer, I open the entrance gate, the garage through the menu.  With the help of network cameras I see what is happening in the yard, in order to close everything later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58d/f13/4d7/58df134d7b9f5bac41045dbd175db3fa.png" alt="image"><br><br><blockquote>  14:00 Alice: It is now 14 o'clock <br>  15:00 Alice: It is now 15 o'clock <br>  16:00 Alice: It is now 16 o'clock <br>  16:54 Alice: The sun sets <br>  17:00 Alice: It is now 5 pm <br>  17:24 Alice: It should be dark outside ... </blockquote><br><br>  Dawn and dawn take time from the Internet, as well as other useful information.  The Internet is a universal info-sensor. <br><br><blockquote>  17:30 Alice: Soon the hosts should come home from work, warm up <br>  17:30 Alice: Exit saving mode <br>  17:30 Alice: Temperature is lower than desired, open the heating valve </blockquote><br><br>  The same forced exit from economy mode, as well as early in the morning. <br><br><blockquote>  18:00 Alice: It is now 6 pm <br>  18:14 Alice: Attention!  Open the entrance gate. <br>  18:15 Alice: Motion detected. <br>  18:15 Alice: The gate is closed. </blockquote><br><br>  My wife and child usually return home before me.  In passing, I notice this event by reading my Twitter feed, where I have Alice‚Äôs ‚Äúfriends‚Äù account (non-public, of course), where she regularly writes about all the events. <br><br><blockquote>  19:00 Alice: It is now 19 o'clock <br>  19:32 Alice: Sergey left the office <br>  19:55 Alice: Sergey is passing the shop "Neighbors" <br>  19:55 Alice: I am switching to a waiting mode. <br>  20:00 Alice: It is now 20 o'clock <br>  20:00 Alice: I switch to night mode <br>  20:03 Alice: Sergey passes the auto market <br>  20:12 Alice: Sergey approaches the house <br>  20:12 Alice: Automatic gate opening. <br>  20:13 Alice: Attention!  Open the entrance gate. <br>  20:14 Alice: Sergey is already at home.  The gate can be closed. <br>  20:14 Alice: The gates are closed. </blockquote><br><br>  This is me coming home.  First, passing several hot-spots, I got under the pattern of behavior described in the system and Alice herself put herself into the standby mode of my return.  The latter implied an automatic opening of the entrance gate when I was approaching the house - a trifle, but terribly convenient, especially when you return on a motorcycle and to open the gate "manually" you have to tighten the gloves, look where you put the remote control from the gate drive this time.  In addition, the system uniquely determined that it was I who arrived, since  A constantly working bluetooth device scanner spotted my phone in the range of my MAC address and it was decided that the recently opened gate should be closed. <br><br><blockquote>  21:00 Alice: It is now 21 o'clock <br>  22:00 Alice: It is now 10 pm <br>  23:00 Alice: It is now 23 o'clock <br>  23:30 Alice: Alice wishes you a good night.  Do not forget to air the room before going to bed. </blockquote><br><br>  That's all.  The day was not overshadowed by any emergency situations, all systems worked normally. <br><br>  PS Taking this opportunity, I will tell you a bit about the news of the <a href="http://smartliving.ru/">MajorDoMo</a> project, on the platform of which all of the above has been implemented. <br><br>  First, as I have already mentioned, a new version of the system was released with a whole bunch of not major, but important changes and corrections.  Despite the fact that the collected versions are rarely released (once every few months), the system is constantly updated, which can be monitored through <a href="https://github.com/sergejey/majordomo">GitHub</a> .  In addition, the latest version has a built-in update mechanism that allows, if desired, to pull out all the freshest right from GitHub. <br><br>  Secondly, and most importantly, a community is formed around the project - on the forum you can see how the system is being introduced to others, what devices are assembled (and how), problems that are being solved, experience in setting up and programming is being shared.  The community is still small, but very active :) <br><br>  Thirdly, for, let's say, educational and educational purposes, I have assembled a prototype of the Smart Apartment set.  It consists of several basic modules, each of which in one form or another is described on the pages of the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfb/534/06c/bfb53406c0984adfd15441068f788bd1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Read more <a href="http://smartliving.ru/Main/SmartFlat">here</a> . <br><br>  PPS You can consider advertising, but the following message is directly related to the project :) In one of the articles on Habr√©, I saw a mention of Nootech company - a Belarusian manufacturer of home automation devices.  I had the opportunity to meet and talk with them, because  they are located, just like me, in the city of Minsk.  So, at the moment they have a <a href="http://www.noo.com.by/products/index.php%3Fid%3D90">product line</a> that allows to introduce basic automation of load and lighting control using wireless modules and remotes at home, but, as you understand, I am more interested in devices that can be integrated into the overall control environment of Smart Home and me I was very interested in the information that Nootekhnika is planning to release control devices for its modules using a USB stick attached to a computer.  In general, I was assured that a prototype of this device will be released soon and I will be one of the first to receive it for testing :) So, if everything goes according to plan, soon another budget will be integrated into the project device for wireless lighting control. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160067/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160067/</a></p>
