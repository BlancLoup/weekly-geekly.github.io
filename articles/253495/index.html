It's time to show what happened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/770/bf2/ec8/770bf2ec83ae42d4b3ce4b772c860bd0.jpg"><br><br>  First, on the site of the data center there was an open field, then a huge 100-meter trench was dug.  Then the data center looked like a concrete platform, and even later - a hexagonal building was built from metal structures, inside which there are six data center modules (highlighted in green in the diagram), a ‚Äúcommand center‚Äù for monitoring the backbone network throughout the country and an office (more on construction can be read in the publication <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/244785/">"Data Center of our dreams in Yaroslavl: photos of construction and launch"</a> ).

The mobile data center and the neighboring blue container with DES worked at this point during commissioning and generally held a number of basic services until we raised the first computer hall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c76/2ba/e4e/c762bae4e43848f790361fca1fe5465e.jpeg"><br>  <i>Container Data Center</i> <br><br>  Here is the ‚Äúcosmic cruise‚Äù scheme: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0c/396/b56/e0c396b56e7644fabc9449b2b828f783.png"><br>  <i>Object schema</i> <br><br>  The Hexagon in the middle is the main building where the Enterprise halls and office and service areas are located.  The container data center is downstairs, it's small, and soon it will be taken away.  And the two blocks of the "engines" of the cruiser are independent power installations (Power modules).  Let's go there first. <br><br>  Here is the building with power installations outside: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db2/6fa/57d/db26fa57d73242e9ba2526e6183f0713.jpeg"><br>  <i>Power module where DDIBP is located</i> <br><br>  Diesel fuel is stored nearby in a blue container.  In winter, we pour winter diesel, in summer - summer.  There is no need to pump out anywhere - we generate diesel fuel at monthly maintenance checks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a47/2f0/cae/a472f0caef0244249e1cc0214cde8ed5.jpeg"><br>  <i>Fuel storage capacity 30 000 l</i> <br><br>  But let's go inside the power module.  We are met here is such a miracle device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/577/52d/0c4/57752d0c43ef4456917736c6033d383c.jpeg"><br>  <i>Motor-generator system for diesel-dynamic UPS</i> <br><br>  This is a whole range of devices.  How it all works, we have already told at the design stage, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/139184/">here</a> are the details (and the <a href="http://youtu.be/VqnDis66lrI">animation of the</a> manufacturer).  If it is very short - the power from two independent substations comes to us from the city, which is reserved by a system of diesel generators.  In the middle of the circuit between the sources and the payload is a kinetic drive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a10/997/b24/a10997b24c074e36aea63fc94172939d.jpg"><br>  <i>Scheme of organization of power supply complex</i> <br><br>  The data center will consume up to 10 MW.  For obvious reasons, it is much more economical to take food from the city.  But if something happens, you need to have either a huge supply of UPS batteries while the diesel is warming up, or a smaller supply of batteries and a pool with ice water for cooling, or your constantly operating power center (generation).  One of the best solutions is DDIBP: a kinetic drive, plus a fast-start diesel, which is in standby mode.  In practice, everything is much more complicated, but the general principle of operation is exactly that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc2/577/48e/bc257748e211470880f5eb0fbe2c0e26.jpeg"><br>  <i>DDIBP control panel</i> <br><br>  It should be noted that the food from the city comes to us is not the highest quality.  When it deteriorates or disappears, due to the energy of the kinetic accumulator (a seven-ton flywheel spun up to a tremendous speed).  The energy of the residual rotation of the flywheel is enough with a margin to start the diesel even on the second attempt.  Of the additional advantages - the same system makes it very easy to cope with the majority of power surges - roughly speaking, DDIBP in the middle of the circuit easily smoothes an average of about 80% of peaks and dips without turning on the motor-generator.  Another advantage of using DDIBP is the absence of a problem with switching to a backup power system, since the kinetic drive is permanently connected to the circuit. <br><br>  The fuel cleaning system, besides the usual filtration, also includes an impurity separation system, which performs fuel cleaning immediately before it is fed to the fuel pump. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/189/985/29a/18998529a4ef43a3adc26501666bb889.jpeg"><br>  <i>Filter separator fuel supply system</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b3d/f0d/0ba/b3df0d0ba3fd46d49cfe907390888a83.jpeg"><br>  <i>Cylinder covers</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d75/d9c/183/d75d9c1832fb45e3b9721e448a4abb8e.jpeg"><br>  <i>Solenoid valve fuel supply system</i> <br><br>  One of our important tasks now is to guarantee energy efficiency with low consumption. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c37/4e9/498/c374e94988c041e7a6564fb13796a45c.jpeg"><br>  <i>The pipe leads to the second floor, where the systems for plugging and cleaning of exhaust gases are located.</i>  <i>In particular, the 4.5-meter two-ton silencers</i> <br><br>  Last time we promised to show the size of the silencers.  Promised - we carry out: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/125/8ca/d52/1258cad5288e45b0a2a488a4c77e0432.jpeg"><br>  <i>At the DDIBP plant in Germany</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b53/9dd/33c/b539dd33cdf9441596621c784aae8c19.jpeg"><br>  <i>This is a fuel tank.</i> <br><br>  The diesel for the DGS is stored in large quantities in the blue house outside, and in this tank - the necessary reserve for an hour or two of work (depending on the load).  The tanks are connected, the fuel can be brought endlessly, and it will first be poured into the main storage, then - here, then - in the DSU itself.  Of course, the second power module is the same, and there is its own autonomous fuel storage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c27/1c1/ad8/c271c1ad819341b287aba7391b0c8639.jpeg"><br>  <i>Discharge Ventilation Fan</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db9/c33/107/db9c331079874c91a9583606addb6a8c.jpeg"><br>  <i>Pipelines for diesel engine cooling system.</i>  <i>A coolant circulates in pipes, which passes through radiators installed on the second floor.</i> <br><br>  To reduce losses, the flywheel rotates in helium gas.  While it is in this environment, the cost of maintaining rotation, even at a wild speed, is minimal, that is, it is enough to invest energy in it for promotion, and then it consumes very little.  Efficiency&gt; 99%.  Then, when necessary, the flywheel transfers the stored energy to the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0eb/460/34e/0eb46034e94842a3b6abba5556c86873.jpeg">  &gt; <br>  <i>Reducer-distributor supply of helium in the kinetic drive</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/851/acd/836/851acd83699743b8bdb59905d1561652.jpeg"><br>  <i>Emergency stop valve of a diesel engine with a ‚Äúfire‚Äù signal or emergency shutdown with a red button.</i>  <i>It is used only as a last resort, and actually blocks the oxygen to the motor.</i> <br><br>  A fire is extinguished with Novec 1230 gas - at the concentration used it is not dangerous to humans.  Our fire extinguishing system is smart: in the event of a fire on a diesel engine, it gives a chance to handle the fire independently.  This increases the vitality of the data center. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3b/006/116/e3b0061169634c078b5c946ad813a371.jpeg"><br>  <i>Starter batteries</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa8/fbc/b30/fa8fbcb300514499a1270c4f10a5f295.jpeg"><br>  <i>Power cables from the generator to the load (data center)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f83/4a0/203/f834a0203821426ba6484694853d26b4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Fire alarm siren.</i>  <i>As soon as it turns on - you need to run out of the room.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/781/f27/71d/781f2771daca48289952eca135276f9b.jpeg"><br>  <i>Control cabinet ventilation system</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b9/27e/201/5b927e2018b34eedb43990a2455818ac.jpeg"><br>  <i>Automatic switch distribution box</i> <br><br>  Before you protection from fool.  The lock closes critical panels.  To press something, you need to remove the plastic curtain, turning it 180 degrees.  Then push the button hard enough.

Tractor-rheostat.  In the trailer there is something like a huge heater that effectively heats the air in order to take more power from the power module.  It was not that the winter in Yaroslavl became warmer, but that they could have done it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/310/071/8f9/3100718f9a03424da03925fdba7f09de.jpeg"><br>  <i>Tractor Rheostat</i> <br><br>  And these are two interesting objects.  Lightning trap and lightning trap.  More precisely, on the power module, a high mast structure is a passive lightning rod - a metal pin diverting the discharge deep underground.  And then, in the center, on the roof of the data center, you can already see the active installation of a similar purpose, it allows you to achieve a similar effect only with significantly smaller sizes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14d/ec1/207/14dec12071da4a01aa501d0b5ef5675b.jpeg"><br>  <i>Passive and active ground outlets</i> <br><br>  The second module is symmetrical to the first.  The only thing that distinguishes its surroundings is this additional object.  This is a separate DES for the office, the requirements for uninterrupted power are much lower, which means that you do not need to spend the power DDBP. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dda/f6b/e04/ddaf6be04d744434b0f89a4f0522ddbf.jpeg"><br>  <i>DES for office</i> <br><br>  <b>Now we go down in the metro to the Kremlin.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/578/21c/36a/57821c36a4a84233a8ea65199d25b6ef.jpeg"><br>  <i>Cable collector</i> <br><br>  In fact, of course, this is a cable collector, but if you turn off the lights correctly, you can devote newcomers to the secrets of the USSR. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5b/fed/1a3/d5bfed1a3dc34d68bf3087d118b4f753.jpeg"><br><br>  You can also do this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/084/8e6/71f/0848e671f43c4f4380f1ed9bee0cefec.jpeg"><br><br>  Here are the cables as thick as the arm of a healthy engineer.  Well, or with the leg of a pretty girl.  For scraps of this cable was a real hunt for some installers at the construction site.  According to their ideas, he is probably golden.  They got a little, but they spoiled our nerves pretty much. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/566/b97/e06/566b97e061b24e49a8899c697758e473.jpeg"><br><br>  The cable, by the way, is mostly domestic, produced by the Kolchuginsky plant from the Vladimir region.  There were no problems at our facility, but, of course, the cable should always be checked upon acceptance - it can be brought with a break, and with broken insulation, and a lot more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6a/3c0/d42/c6a3c0d42cc04ff9a4548dc9dda3b2a0.jpeg"><br>  <i>"Glamor" fire fighting foam.</i>  <i>When mounted, it expands and very tightly covers everything that can, to prevent the spread of fire and smoke through the holes, where, in this case, the cable passes.</i> <br><br>  So, there is food.  The data center lacks more cooling and the Internet.  And beer, but the brewery is right outside our window.  We are fine with the transport network, there are two main communication rooms that reserve each other.  4 inputs of the main optics are connected to the data center, we have provided the possibility of installing 100Gbit / s transponders. <br><br>  One day we will tell you about the device of our communication center in more detail. <br><br>  <b>Now we go to look at the cooling.</b> <br><br>  You can read more about cooling design <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/141363/">here</a> . <br><br>  Again, briefly the main things: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c4/d48/365/3c4d48365bf44949afbcd3719f4abc33.png"><br>  <i>Natural Free Cooling system organization chart</i> <br><br>  Freekuling works like this.  In the "face" (mixing chamber) our data center is blowing in the wind.  The cold air enters the main duct, gives the cold to the internal circuit, then flies farther through the data center and goes to the steppe.  The hot environment of the machine room gives off heat through the heat exchanger to the outer space of the hangar in which the data center modules are located.  Hot springs go up through the holes in the roof or forcibly through the mixing chamber.  While simple, <i>right</i> ? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b5/11a/927/8b511a9275dc4626afcdf7f3378028df.png"><br>  <i>Layout of the main duct</i> <br><br>  The first one to meet us is the spider.  This is a chiller.  Spider we call him because of the characteristic shape. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad5/952/5a7/ad59525a74d34719b59762e41cfbc975.jpeg"><br>  <i>Chiller</i> <br><br>  Why a chiller in a data center with free cooling?  This is because if the external temperature rises above 24 degrees Celsius, the machinery will not be cooled with the desired efficiency.  Let me remind you that we decided to build a data center in Yaroslavl also because it is cooler in summer (remember the night) than in Moscow, and you can save on cooling. <br><br>  However, up to about a month a year, the average temperature rises above the indicated limit.  In this case, we use the second cooling system on chillers that cool water in a huge network of pipelines.  Again, simplifying to impropriety - these are large refrigerators that cool water.  They require much more power, but nowhere to go.  Reserving N + 2 chillers, this means three units are installed at the first machine hall. <br><br>  Do you recognize these heroes? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24c/cd2/b28/24ccd2b28c56400ea87b59d876910084.jpeg"><br>  <i>Expansion tanks</i> <br><br>  There are 180 tons of water in the circuit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ffd/241/943/ffd2419436694d838fb8bc12cd42990e.jpeg"><br>  <i>Trunk manifold</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe7/0dd/9e7/fe70dd9e7dcd4881a25c38f5a371c5e3.jpeg"><br>  <i>Drain cock</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79d/ace/4e0/79dace4e0da245279d5eef495d8030b5.jpeg"><br>  <i>Another spider, but the other side (on the side of the control panel)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90f/406/216/90f4062168664780a55aaf796b6ce505.jpeg"><br>  <i>Balancing valve</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7c/6cd/6e7/e7c6cd6e75e24071b0c51189f78ee4c5.jpeg"><br>  <i>If emergency draining of water is required, it will flow into special pits.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f15/d82/696/f15d826968d24215a168b34e5cefeb79.jpeg"><br>  <i>Pumps provide circulation in the circuit.</i>  <i>The second pump is a reserve.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/346/b55/05d/346b5505d8d44492b438d798921575bf.jpeg"><br>  <i>Freonoprovoda lead to the roof.</i>  <i>Bending is an oil-lifting hinge to ensure the return of oil to the compressor.</i> <br><br>  <b>Soon we will finish with the glands and go to the gym.</b>  He is right behind this wall.  But!  First there is an important point.  The fact is that the ambient air temperature is enough to cool the machinery with the necessary supply of only 8 months a year.  And we run chillers for two to four weeks.  Where are at least another three and a half months?  Here, look at the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d0/56c/930/1d056c9306da47ac849bb4a3268da753.jpeg"><br>  <i>MNFC - heat exchanger</i> <br><br>  This is a heat exchange chamber, from here begins the cold corridor of the turbine hall, and here ends the hot.  That is, in this device we make cold air out of hot air.  This is a key element of the cooling system.  The heat exchanger works in both the outside air cooling mode and the water cooling mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b44/bef/b75/b44befb755d04a7f879b1c98e9abc6b3.jpeg"><br><br>  The main mode - a large amount of outdoor air is passed through the heat exchanger. <br>  If the air is hot, we close the air intake and begin to cool the exchange chamber with a lead from the chiller, wasting energy on cooling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07a/9d0/765/07a9d076511c40aba2d9ae01dd56972c.jpeg"><br>  <i>Heat is exchanged behind this grate.</i> <br><br>  But when the air is warmer by only 3-4 degrees (up to 24 degrees), which happens in the "fallen out" months, we use life hacking from a school physics course.  We simply saturate the air with moisture (we run it through the wall of water fog behind such a device), which gives the desired delta in the adiabatic process.  This technology is much more economical than the chiller system, and is widely used in conjunction with free cooling. <br><br>  Here, through, right through the building, passes the exhaust main duct.  This is such a quite wide hot corridor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2f/ca7/643/c2fca76430894a61b173e0ac9ed138a3.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1fa/7d7/b5e/1fa7d7b5e1f14d1f8197c97babcad117.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad3/79c/777/ad379c777af940a1b951da53efe55454.jpeg"><br>  <i>Rooflights on the roof.</i>  <i>The flaps open if necessary, and release hot streams of air.</i> <br><br>  <b>All-all, we look mashzal.</b>  Now the rooms from the second to the sixth look like this: the modules have not yet been mounted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/069/bcf/70f/069bcf70f22d46c49c472bc46eb3d140.jpeg"><br><br>  But the first module has been launched and is now being filled.  We arrived at the very moment when some of the servers are already running, but the hall is still half empty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd8/654/629/dd86546293604608a199648009958762.jpeg"><br>  <i>Data center module</i> <br><br>  Since the racks are typical, and the iron is generally homogeneous (this is our data center, and we know exactly what will be put here), it was possible to mount all the inputs and outputs at once. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/993/5ad/07a/9935ad07a440450a9e93f5008601e899.jpeg"><br>  <i>Power sockets for connecting racks</i> <br><br>  Another plus of typical racks is the known dimensions of the cold and hot corridor.  Here is the cold air blowing from the bottom of the raised floor.  These panels are now covered with polyethylene - the corridor is not used, and we don‚Äôt want engineers to blow away anything.  By the way, these cold corridors are perhaps the last reminder of why the admin is always in a sweater.  Because it is very cold and blowing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d94/faf/f5c/d94faff5cba6420faa3a868edcb6acb4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Cold air corridor</i> <br><br>  And this is our teleport device, a prototype. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae4/2c4/799/ae42c47995474463b4d620d650d5169e.jpeg"><br><br>  But seriously - these are the doors that close (limit) the cold corridor so that the cooling works as efficiently as possible.  This is how it looks in the part of the hall where the stands are already there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/6cd/c60/9336cdc607fc47a1bfca28f2316ccad1.jpeg"><br>  <i>Racks</i> <br><br>  <b>Actually, the rack.</b>  The following equipment is now installed: <br>  - Oracle servers of Hi-End and Mid-Range class; <br>  - Storage system built on HDS, HP, IBM, Brocade hardware; <br>  - The network core is built on Avaya hardware; <br>  - HP servers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/911/4fc/0cd/9114fc0cd54c40e9926d11287ff32abe.jpeg"><br>  <i>Power distribution system for racks: busbars with power take-offs</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5df/e9a/299/5dfe9a299e114f10b9d2596da6cd069b.jpeg"><br>  <i>We have a top-of-rack Panduit SKS system</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/296/574/0e9/2965740e984b4c108f5c3e3ef11e2ea9.jpeg"><br>  <i>Top-of-rack cassettes</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d2/bfe/adc/6d2bfeadc9e247b2b2cb45c6eb6c50f6.jpeg"><br>  <i>Four cross-minus, soon to be five</i> <br><br>  Accuracy of installation - our small fad.  Even in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/beeline/blog/229861/">Moscow test zone</a> , where everything changes every day and the devil breaks the leg in the equipment, the installation is more or less accurate.  We know from experience that an unsigned and carelessly mounted cable can cause a service interruption. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a04/e9f/bb4/a04e9fbb409c412aa5e09c9b00b05be1.jpeg"><br>  <i>Switching Aggregation Switches</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/605/da3/0fd/605da30fddd64b1fbc51c849be1d1862.jpeg"><br>  <i>Active network equipment</i> <br><br>  10% of the hall are designed for high-density racks - up to 20 kW per unit.  The most powerful racks are in the center of the room, there is a supply of cold because of the peculiarities of the movement of high-velocity air flow. <br><br>  And here are the storage systems.  They have not yet connected.  Somewhere here will be stored data about your balance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d3/1ae/368/9d31ae3688aa45cf9d8f3fff2341f3e4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Tape library</i> <br><br>  These are fan heaters.  With their help, we checked the room for the ability to remove heat.  Yes, yes, just heated it and watched what happened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab1/58f/0fe/ab158f0fe2314cdd9a38a601abf5856c.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c3/5a6/b50/0c35a6b506e441d6885b443d66e349e8.jpeg"><br>  <i>Branch to the busline</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc8/732/b2c/fc8732b2cd534cc585030168d22130b3.jpeg"><br>  <i>Novec again, the stock lasts two fire extinguishing systems.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a88/b22/d89/a88b22d891d343f39beb378176b7b39f.jpeg"><br>  <i>This is how the power cables that we saw in the basement go to the machine hall.</i> <br><br>  <b>Now let's look at the office to admins and not only.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/817/d7d/c76/817d7dc76d50438490dbcd755588bd06.jpeg"><br>  <i>Main entrance to the data center building</i> <br><br>  We go around the data center and see temporary modular units - this is the dining room and the "office" - the places where the shift worked during the construction of the facility, when the office premises were not yet ready.  The office is much better than in such a ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f2/f8b/ab1/7f2f8bab10a14cf7b6e991ae47f2757d.jpeg"><br>  <i>Temporary office and dining room</i> <br><br>  At the entrance we have a data center layout: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/560/97d/a3e/56097da3ec21479fb99b0d844ef2a92c.jpeg"><br><br>  Highlighted cooling circuit: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/905/662/f8b/905662f8b78a493e84543ecbc4b870d6.jpeg"><br><br>  On the roof you can see the chiller condenser units: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/028/be0/701/028be0701c4a4d11b478857b003de551.jpeg"><br><br>  You can also highlight the power and trunk inputs: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc1/116/e85/cc1116e85d4349d7be55cb2d1c954191.jpeg"><br><br>  Before I get inside, I'll show the helmets in the dressing room.
