The infant seeks to know reality, to fill it with his imagination.  With the launch of the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, Tango technology will allow you to re-explore the world around. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/lenovo/blog/279818/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/99e/fef/98f/99efef98f0bcc2485254f95779ceb164.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Smartphones are somewhat like children.  They are always with us, we cannot imagine our life without them.  But, unlike children, smartphones, until recently, were far less savvy.  Gadgets do not understand where they are, where they are going and they have no idea about the world around them.  Smartphones cannot cognize the surrounding reality through tactile sensations and expand their knowledge through the ‚Äútrial of everything‚Äù, like babies.  Technology Tango promises to change everything radically. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/151/77d/da7/15177dda78e3b888054f26d384b952f2.png">

    <h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Conceptualizing Tango</font> </h2><br>  Let's imagine smartphones with ordinary black boxes that are not able to think and feel, the world does not exist for them.  This is the starting point for smartphones: at first there was nothing.  And then Tango appeared.  Phab 2 Pro with Tango on board is like a child who is starting to understand that he is surrounded by a lot of interesting things.  Children learn the reality of the senses: eyes, hands, ears, and so on.  Phab 2 Pro does it through cameras that open a window into our world for a smartphone.  Three of the four cameras of the device are sensors that allow the gadget to look at the environment.  These sensors analyze information using three core technologies. <br><br>  Tango tracks movement - this is the first way to transfer data to a smartphone.  A fisheye camera that recognizes angles, as well as tools for calculating speed and direction, allows the device to determine where it is located.  For example, in the room next to the refrigerator, moves with you or just lies on the table.  Of course, this does not mean that the smartphone understands why these or other objects are needed. <br><br>  Next, your smartphone, like a child, you need to remember what he saw.  A device with Tango is capable of it.  Data is uploaded to the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù and, if necessary, taken from there.  Information is stored in a single data center, common to Tango smartphones.  Having entered the room with the Tango-gadget, where before that there was already another person with his smartphone on the Tango, your device will instantly recognize the situation.  Thus, the more you use your smartphone, the smarter it becomes. <br><br>  Finally, Phab 2 Pro can determine the distance to the object.  The device has a separate sensor that sends infrared rays to objects and calculates the distance based on the data obtained. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/adf/6bc/f36/adf6bcf369394f59415269cbd28d342b.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">Just take tango for granted</font> </h2><br>  Until now, the only way the smartphone could interact with the world was GPS technology.  Think about when the device needs GPS.  Usually the cards come first.  It may seem that positioning is generally not necessary in most cases.  But how would you use Fitbit, Periscope, Uber, or at least Tinder?  Google, Facebook, Twitter and Snapchat would work completely differently, and the mobile applications of these companies are closely tied to GPS.  We took GPS for granted.  Without this technology, many of our favorite applications and functions of smartphones would not work as intended, or were not implemented at all. <br><br>  Tango will change our lives in the same way that GPS has transformed the way we communicate with the world using smartphones.  The number of applications and usage scenarios will grow, and convenience will become increasingly apparent. <br><br>  Tango's task is to create spatial information.  This means that all objects and places in the world will be available directly from your smartphone, just like now you are making requests to Google.  Need a closet closet?  Phone will help you quickly find it.  Forgot where you left your wallet?  The smartphone will tell you that it is in the office.  Go to the museums of London and are interested in any sculpture?  Look at it through the Tango-device, and you will immediately receive comprehensive information about the work of art.  Ordered and wait for the car Uber?  Tango through augmented reality will mark the car that is coming to you, and it will be easy to see in the stream.  The variety of applications that can be improved is unaccountable. <br><br>  But for the realization of all the possibilities, it is necessary that a wide range of people have devices with Tango.  Only in this case will it be possible to make augmented reality the same mundane and ubiquitous thing as GPS.  We want to make Tango as familiar as power windows in a car or NFC chips in smartphones.  For this you need to release a very good phone, and we have it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/271/839/746/271839746aeee21608a855ef00eeecbd.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#d8291e">The best smartphone for Tango</font> </h2><br>  Phab 2 Pro is the most affordable smartphone with Tango technology.  Expected price - 35,990 p.  The device is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 660 processor and a graphics accelerator, which are designed for Tango and fully reveal the new features.  Sensor Time-of-Flight, which determines the distance to objects, is also present in the Phab 2 Pro. <br><br>  I needed a phone that would become the best flagship in its class, and it worked.  It uses revolutionary innovations that relate to audio and video.  Think about recording your child's first words or watching the concert of your favorite band you were on last night.  This is the only smartphone that can accurately reproduce the sounds of the most important and memorable events of life. <br><br>  Phab 2 Pro is the first phone in the world that can record pure 360-degree concert sound with Dolby Audio 5.1, Dolby Atmos and three noise-canceling microphones.  The device is a 16 megapixel camera with support for recording video in 4K.  Filmed videos look great on a 6.4-inch screen with a resolution of QHD (2560x1440). <br><br>  Also, you will immediately be available Tango functionality.  The difference between Tango and other smartphone technologies, such as GPS, NFC and QR code scanning, is speed.  On Phab 2 Pro installed application that allows you to determine the size of the object, simply pointing the smartphone to the corners of the subject.  The smartphone will get the original game with augmented reality - for example, a shooter in which you need to move around the room and hide behind real shelters.  If this is not enough, then ‚Äúsettle‚Äù in the house of a dinosaur and study it closely - a unique opportunity, without exaggeration. <br><br>  Phab 2 Pro with Tango will be at the forefront of progress.  Data exchange through the data base will expand the available functionality, the world will appear in a different light - we are waiting for a new reality that will show the full potential of Tango.  Therefore, we strive to make Phab 2 Pro as best as possible - it will be one of the main smartphones of this generation. <br><br>  Exit Phab 2 Pro is expected in late October. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372609/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372609/</a></p>
