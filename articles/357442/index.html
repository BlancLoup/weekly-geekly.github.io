In some cases, this is unverified information that can be used as a tool to achieve a variety of political and commercial goals.  This tool is used by both individuals and large corporations. <br><br>  Fake news is widely used as political and ideological propaganda, published for a wide range of readers.  Materials are published on specialized resources, which are many.  And they, as it turned out, can even <a href="https://www.digitalshadows.com/blog-and-research/fake-news-is-more-than-a-political-battlecry">be rented out</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Fake news resources are usually used to influence socio-economic processes, as well as politicians.  The timely publication of materials, albeit fake ones, can contribute to inflating the value of shares of certain companies that cost cents, but after using a powerful information resource, they increase in price many times over.  In the wake of the HYIP, those who benefit from it sell stocks and get huge profits. <br><br>  Cryptocurrencies are no exception.  Altcoin holders can use fake media to artificially raise the rate of their coins against the dollar, and after reaching peak values ‚Äã‚Äãsell cryptocurrency at the maximum rate.  The ICO organizers of various kinds do the same.

      Fake news services are very popular.  Not so long ago, Bitcoin users checked the purse of the ‚ÄúPump and Dump‚Äù service and found out that in the past two months, this wallet received krivatovalyuyuyu totaling $ 326,000. In addition, there are services that allow you to run using social bots to control the situation in the information market.  Moreover, the cost of such services is not exorbitant - to test bots at work costs only $ 7, which even a schoolboy can afford. <br><br>  Other services offer content distribution across hundreds and thousands of information platforms, including forums, blogs and boards.  Such tools provide for the possibility of using a large number of bots to post topics of interest to the customer in various forums. <br><br>  According to researchers from Digital Shadows, the number of references to fake news services over the past two years has increased almost four times.  In 2015, this figure was 418 references.  In 2017, it grew up to 1381. And the development of fake news resources does not stand still.  They are improving and becoming more influential. <br><br>  Experts found the following nuances: <br><br><ul><li>  Misinformation is different from ordinary fake news; </li><li>  The main motive for creating this kind of information resources is money; </li><li>  Tools fake news creators are very diverse; </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3c/243/9aa/e3c2439aac6901249a2ddc4a580d87b9.png"><br><br>  Their number is increasing, and the struggle with them is becoming more and more difficult.  Few people are surprised by the fact that traditional media organizations are often victims of news resources spreading fake news.  Such sites use domains that are similar to official news URLs.  Representatives of the same organization Digital Shadows found that 40 sites of well-known news agencies have more than 85,000 possible variations of the domain name.  And 2858 of them are busy and actively used. <br><br>  Here we are talking about cybersquatting and typosquatting with the subsequent use of a slightly modified domain of a known news resource.  On some of these sites, false news is distributed, the purpose of which is to change public opinion about the target organization or to change the influence of any external factors that can affect the ‚Äúordered‚Äù organization. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe entry threshold (becoming lower, it‚Äôs now the lowest since the fake media existed. This means new opportunities for fraudsters of all kinds,‚Äù says Rick Holland, vice president of strategic development for Digital Shadows. ‚ÄùOf course, rumors, misinformation and fake news has always played an important role for the human community, but now the very method of disseminating data around the world has changed. <br><br>  Now Digital Shadows is trying to help organizations that are in a difficult situation in connection with the actions of the creators of false news.  Representatives of this company are developing tools to counteract fake resources. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/357442/">https://habr.com/ru/post/357442/</a></p>
