But this is not a contribution, but a way to spend money.  The second option is to go to the bank and give money for a year.  The problem, obviously, is that you will receive the same amount at the end of the year, taking into account inflation.  There are a lot of options, and all of them are more or less known and understood. <br><br>  But I just want to invest.  30 thousand rubles, that is a naturally ridiculous amount for any project, but quite specific money for you personally.  And it is possible.

    <a name="habracut"></a><h4>  How it works? </h4><br>  Shares in a company can be divided according to the following principle: 50% + one share to the founder, 20% to a large investor and the remaining 30% to several hundred or thousands of people with 10-30-50 thousand rubles.  It is clear that it is often simpler to sign a couple of large investors for the remaining interest if the project is worth it, but microinvestment is better, faster and gives the project a couple of important profits, not the last one ‚Äî of many people who are personally interested in the project. <br><br><h4>  Why is it so important to have many micro-investors? </h4><br>  Because it is from many people who understand the essence of the project, they know how it works and for it.  This gives this: <br><ul><li>  It is absolutely certain that, together with investments, participants will be able to bring some of their experience.  For example, when making decisions, to justify a specific point of view on the basis of their practice and make the decision more effective. </li><li>  Almost everyone will be the ‚Äúevangelists‚Äù of the project, that is, for example, they will tell about it in social networks, which will immediately give a good start.  As I have already said, my practice shows that 650 micro-investors very quickly reach 150 thousand people with information. </li><li>  The same crowd effect will allow you to quickly find the necessary new ideas, correct bugs in the work of the company and receive feedback.  This control, unattainable with a single control center. </li><li>  A lot of side issues will be solved: in such a group of people there will be necessary contacts that will allow you to get good conditions from suppliers, find personnel, and so on. </li></ul><br><br>  Plus, most likely, each of these people will be a user of the product, that is, they will be able to bring the most valuable thing to the company - experience from the ‚Äúbest‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  It's cool, but why be a microinvestor? </h4><br>  It is clear that it is not clear what to give your 30 thousand rubles for.  And here are some important reasons why it will be useful for microinvestors: <br><ul><li>  First, despite the small amount - this is full access to company information.  Including - financial.  Exactly what is complete, that is, there will be an opportunity to mean the whole thing and learn.  It is generally priceless - for a small amount to learn everything about the new market segment. </li><li>  Secondly, the status of co-owner of the company.  Strange as it may sound, we rely on participation and to some extent the desire to show off in front of others.  For many, the phrase ‚ÄúI am the co-owner of this company‚Äù, abandoned in passing, means very, very much. </li><li>  Thirdly, it is an opportunity to try to work not with the sphere of business.  As in the first case - invaluable experience. </li><li>  Fourth, you can invest at the micro level in many different projects - this is protection against risks. </li><li>  Fifth, it is a full-fledged investment, that is, there is an opportunity to later sell the share and make money on it. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  What is worth investing at the micro level? </h4><br>  There are several categories where attachments will give a lot: <br><ul><li>  If we are talking about finances, then what you understand well.  This allows you to assess the prospects of the business accurately and know what will ‚Äúshoot‚Äù in a year or two. </li><li>  If we are talking about experience, it‚Äôs what is interesting, but where is the high entry threshold.  For example, did you want to open your restaurant?  No question, invest 10 thousand rubles in someone else's - and get invaluable experience in choosing the premises, communicating with suppliers, obtaining licenses and communicating with the sanitary and epidemiological supervision first hand.  What usually costs several million in the "crystallized" form of the franchisee-leadership, by the way. </li><li>  If we are talking about deep moral satisfaction - in what can become legendary and new.  In the crazy projects that would have no chance to shoot, if not for the bright idea and support for those who are willing to risk 10 thousand rubles for the sake of something magical. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  What exactly is not worth doing </h4><br>  It is definitely not worth investing money if you need it (or will need it) for basic material things in the future.  For example, pulling money from the family budget in the region to invest in a project in the hope of making a profit more banking is a bad idea.  You can invest only when you clearly know what will happen with money and how - even for such amounts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/165969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/165969/</a></p>
