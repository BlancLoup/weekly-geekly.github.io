  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 reasons why you stopped using Google Buzz</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.socialtimes.com/wordpressnew/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/google-buzz.gif"><br><br>  While Google Buzz continues to cause a huge response from early techno-adepts, the ‚Äúbuzz‚Äù that they started (pardon the pun) dies out.  Now only the most dedicated users pretend to use the service, and it's time to doubt whether there is enough Buzz excerpt to expand their reach to the audience.  Currently, Gmail already has a massive network of users, most of whom most likely remain in their inbox and the Buzz for them is just an icon with the signature "(100+)".  Here are 5 main reasons why we think you stopped using Buzz. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  1. You have too many emails. </h3><br>  Seriously!  My box is not empty anyway, but I still have to get through a bunch of buzz updates?  Such questions are asked by the majority of users when they first encounter the overload of their mailbox.  Although we love to spend our time communicating with our friends, we are always overwhelmed by the number of messages that reach us every day.  Maybe Google is ready to spend more time focusing on filtering out information before it gets to us! <br><br><h3>  2. No one comments on your updates. </h3><br>  And although you can continue to post at random, face it - no one responds to your messages anymore.  And although Robert Scoble and Mashable seem to have 30 or more people commenting on each post, most users find that they can‚Äôt increase the amount of feedback from their friends.  After a while, you begin to feel lonely and after 10 updates that no one answers to you, you will begin to give up.

      Do not think that this problem is peculiar only to Buzz.  Twitter had the same problem, and Google‚Äôs solution was to directly connect you and your contacts through inbox.  Although it may work, this solution is not designed for people completely avoiding the ‚ÄúBuzz‚Äù link since they have been unable to work with it prior to the detriment of their inbox. <br><br><h3>  3. You already have Twitter and Facebook </h3><br>  Google Buzz suffers from Another Social Network (YASN).  He tries to incorporate all the best from Friendfeed and others.  However, it is difficult to create another place to chat with friends when there are an infinite number of convenient services around, and Facebook and Twitter have become so ubiquitous.  And while Google has enough serious muscle power to push another social product to the masses, it may be too late. <br><br><h3>  4. You have too much fun with Foursquare and Gowalla </h3><br>  Yes, Google Buzz also has geo-oriented features, but Gowalla and Foursquare have already managed to become the main leaders in the network.  Perhaps no company will ultimately become a clear winner in a geo-battle.  But still, if the joy is already in getting icons and badges from existing networks, what incentives, compared to other geo-services, will encourage users to start using Google Buzz? <br><br><h3>  5. You are already too legal. </h3><br>  Yes, Sir (or Madam), you are popular!  And try Buzz.  After downloading up to 100 applications to your iPhone, connecting to all your friends via Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Gowalla, Google Buzz, etc., you finally come to the conclusion that being hyper-legitimate is not all that is advertised in life. .  You now have emails, phone calls, text messages, graffiti, multiple inboxes, and more, and now you have so many messages that you cannot handle them. <br><br>  Congratulations, you have become a super-networker!  But now all of a sudden this has become prevail over your work much more than you imagined at the beginning.  The only solution is to start ignoring various sources of messages, because you already have plenty of them.  And the first to come to mind are the newest services you have joined, including Google Buzz. <br><br>  So have you already abandoned Google Buzz or do you think that it is too early to abandon it?  Or maybe you're just an early adept with tough nuts and want to use the product even after it was declared dead on arrival (DOA)? <br><br>  Some comments from the web: <br><br>  - I'm just not interested in this Buzz.  People with whom I communicate for a long time my friends in Facebook and followers in Twitter.  We have zero need for connections through another network. <br><br>  - If you do not know how to use filters in the inbox, perhaps you will daunt us with your favor and will not appear in the Buzz? <br><br>  - Yes, there are not so many opportunities in Buzz, but they can appear in large numbers after a while.  Who knows. <br><br>  - I consider placing Buzz in my inbox the most logical solution.  And everyone is free to choose in what form he looks at the message, minimized or full.  And to be able to respond immediately from the mail is great.  And there is no consensus "luck" or "failure."  People can ignore what is not in the face when they are really busy. <br><br>  Summing up the article: <br><br>  For the majority of network users to start ‚Äúbuzzing‚Äù, it was worth offering this service much earlier, or offering much more functionality than is available now. <br><br>  For certain groups of people, Buzz has become a discovery that they actively use, and find good interlocutors for themselves there. <br>  So suppose that the portrait of the Russian user Buzz is similar to the portrait of the user Habr.  And not in the portrait of contact or alumni. <br><br>  Buzz's functionality will be expanded, and perhaps this article will make its little contribution.  And if a certain percentage of network users will be able to attract these innovations anyway, then out of the group with well-established network links in the buzz-community there will hardly be any outflow. <br><br>  I believe that, thanks to the properties of the aggregator, integration with Google services and relatively good protection from working networks by administrators, this service will continue to recruit its supporters. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89638/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89638/</a></p>
