We found most of these people through Vkontakte.  Today I want to talk about how we, the agency <a href="http://grape.ru/">Grape</a> , experimented with various formats of integration into applications and what results it brought. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>For a start - a little about the game</b> : Red Quest is a Russian project in the format of a city quest.  United by the legend of saving the world and seeking to get a million rubles for this as a reward, every day the participants of the game (they are called Seekers) perform two types of tasks, ‚Äústaff‚Äù (for intelligence, they can be performed at the computer) and ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù (command, in real life). <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LHz1TK2uxo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh_z1bC0jJXytjCPHUkokH0ypJQow" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The project audience is young people aged 16 to 25 years old (of course, active and friendly with the Internet).

      <b>Vkontakte is a great place to find such people</b> .  We used other social networks in the Red Quest SMM activity, however, Vkontakte could provide the greatest coverage needed to achieve the set KPIs and directly attract traffic.  Accordingly, the bet was made on her. <br><br>  Initially, the main sources of traffic from Vkontakte were the communities we developed and targeted advertising.  At the same time, given the goal to attract the maximum number of audience in a short time, the emphasis was placed on direct advertising. <br><br>  <b>Targeting advertising "Vkontakte" worked very well</b> : with its help, we attracted about 10% of all Searchers.  At the same time, the task was not so simple: the fact is that the Red Quest potential audience didn‚Äôt fit into the targeting framework.  It can not be limited geographically - in the Red Quest c the same success can be played from anywhere in the world.  It is difficult to limit it by age or interest - the assignments may be interesting for both 14-year-old metallers and 30-year-old managers who are on leave to Goa.  In such a situation, too wide scope of targeting led to a decrease in CTR, and consequently - an increase in CPC. <br><br>  The solution to the problem was the creation of "targeted" creativity for various clusters of the audience and the constant adjustment of messages.  But even here there are some pitfalls: with an increase in the targeting parameters, CPC grows automatically, and it‚Äôs not a fact that the person who clicks on the ad still becomes a member of Red Quest. <br><br>  <b>And here, just by the way, came the new rules of Vkontakte,</b> which allowed the transition to external links from applications on the service.  Immediately after the introduction of the new rules, we began to experiment in this area.  Here we must say thanks to the developers of applications that supported our experiment. <br><br>  As part of our collaboration with developers, Red Quest related elements were integrated into popular applications.  Surveys were one such format: application users were asked to answer a series of questions about Red Quest in order to receive special bonuses.  Answers had to look at <a href="http://redquest.mts.ru/">redquest.mts.ru</a> <br>  The other approach was simpler: they asked the application users for the code that was hidden in the blog entries of the Seekers' leaders - Pasha Gitelman and Kati Pokatilova. <br><br>  A special case - integration with the game "Dig".  Its developer, Progrestar, branded the Red Quest artifacts and clothes of the characters of the game, created a special Red Quest card where the player could find the fallen spacecraft and collect a source of uninterrupted energy based on it, and also made adjustments to the gameplay itself, settling on the islands players of "fire victims" who suffered from natural disasters. <br><br>  <b>As a result, we received a promotion mechanism</b> with high characteristics of the duration of contact and involvement: starting to search for answers to questions or hidden code, the user immersed himself in the atmosphere of the game, learned about it and saw how others were performing tasks.  In the case of a survey, we had the opportunity to direct the movement of the user through our site, showing him the most interesting moments.  In order to solve the problem of ‚Äúcheaters‚Äù who tried to get bonuses in applications with cunning, our copywriter Stepa Trifonov every few days created new questions that replaced the worked ones. <br><br>  Thus, we were able to pay developers not just for contact or for a click, but for registration and, in fact, for a new player. <br><br>  <b>The CPA (Cost Per Action) payment mechanism is also interesting for developers</b> who offer a relevant audience, because in this case they can increase their income several times in relation to other advertising payment calculation systems. <br><br>  Of course, we must bear in mind that the <b>high performance of this mechanism in our case was reinforced by the</b> game regulations that are unusual for city quests: first, it is free, second, you can participate in it from any corner of the world, and third, you can win You can even register on the last day. <br><br>  That is, to save the world and win a million in the Red Quest final task on December 3, you can even register at the last moment. <br>  Thanks to this format, we were able to provide a constant influx of new users, even by turning off advertising, we still receive several thousand registrations per day. <br><br>  <b>PS The</b> case of Red Quest is in fact unique, and it has a lot of interesting things besides promotion in Vkontakte.  Sometime later I will describe his other parties, in particular, the viral element. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zT5-6XsHOQM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiwKrSAMKpgHcIJ3qWfXs38qfVeEg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109153/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109153/</a></p>
