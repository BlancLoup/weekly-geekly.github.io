We have a gift for you for the New Year holidays.  Today we are launching the first part of our <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-webservices-1%3Futm_source%3Dmipt%26utm_medium%3Dinstitution%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr_post_mrg">new Go course</a> on the Coursera web services platform.  In this part, we look at the basics of syntax, the asynchronous model in Go, performance issues, and the basis for working with HTTP in the standard library. <br><br>  Seeing the unflagging interest in the notes from Tekhnosfera, we decided to record a full-fledged online course to give you the opportunity not only to become familiar with the language in theory, but also to try our hand at solving practical problems.  Well, get a certificate for it, showing that you spent the New Year holidays with the case.  :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We did not set ourselves the goal of making a comprehensive course with an encyclopedic value, rather focused on a quick start for those people who are already engaged in web development, for example, PHP, Python or JavaScript (Node.js), and want to try their hand at Go, but do not know where to start.

      The second part of the course is scheduled for release in January 2018.  It will tell about the main components of the web service, work with various databases and microservices on gRPC. <br><br>  Go is currently the main language of Mail.Ru Mail development, it has already written many loaded services and microservices of our project.  We are very pleased that Go is focused on readability and maintainability of the code.  Why is it important?  With the development of the Internet, the code has to write more and more, its complexity, which complexity, grows with the number of megabytes in the source code.  And now there are more and more tools to reduce the work associated with large code bases: parsers, tools for refactoring, auto-completion in the IDE. <br><br>  If you look at the development of web development, you can see that the industry has always evolved towards more effective tools, not only in terms of server utilization, but also used by programmers in their work.  At first they wrote it on C for the web, in the 90s Perl came to replace it, then PHP, which only allowed Perl to do the same as Perl.  Nevertheless, the complexity continued to grow, and the world began to move on to unification, in order to somehow streamline the endless session handlers and form validators.  Therefore, design patterns and frameworks have received their share of fame. <br><br>  Now it's the turn of syntactic sugar.  Go went well, because it's easy to write on, just read.  It deliberately lacks syntax sugar, there is not even a ternary operator.  The programmer's brain rests on the creativity of colleagues and it is easier to focus on the task.  In the course of the basics of syntax we go through the first lecture, and already in the second we begin to study the asynchronous Go model. <br><br>  We hope this course will serve as your first step into the world of this wonderful language, or it will help you feel more confident about beginners.  The course has already started, <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/golang-webservices-1%3Futm_source%3Dmipt%26utm_medium%3Dinstitution%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr_post_mrg">register</a> . <br><br>  Happy New Year! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345490/</a></p>
