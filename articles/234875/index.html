  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to hire employees - tips for beginners</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>When selecting staff, pay attention to performance</b> . <br><br>  Before proceeding with the review of the resume and the initial selection of a candidate, it is not bad at all to form goals and tasks for yourself that will be faced by the new employee.  Moreover, it would be better if these are not some kind of vague indicators and work, but a clearly formulated ‚Äútask of tomorrow‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In addition, if a new employee will have to become part of an already cohesive team, then it is good to immediately identify common human qualities that will help him quickly integrate into the company's work environment and productively carry out the tasks assigned.  If you want to hire a freelance employee, take it no less responsibly, since a person will have to work and perform tasks productively at a distance, and this is sometimes even more difficult than an office colleague.

      <b>1. A quick review of the summary</b> <br>  This is the first and, as it may be mistakenly thought, the simplest stage of staff recruitment.  At this stage, you should pay attention to how competently, structured and exhaustively the applicant described himself in the summary.  Be sure to indicate the education and experience of previous work. <br>  Many recruiters insist that the resume should fit on one, maximum two sheets and be quickly perceived by the busy manager - after a quick look within 2-3 minutes, you can say - look further or refuse the candidacy. <br><br>  <b>2. Required fields in the resume</b> <br>  General data - last name, first name, age, contact information.  In addition, education and work experience, as well as at the request of the applicant, special courses, trainings, achievements, awards can be indicated.  Please note that people in creative professions, for example, such as designers, can provide a fairly short resume, but they should accompany it with an exhaustive portfolio.  Well, if it will be provided by a separate file with explanations and worse, if you just sent a list of links on which you can see the work. <br><br>  <b>3. Selection factors by resume</b> <br>  The first, but not the main one, is the age of the employee.  The age of the applicant for a new position should not exceed the average age of the team in which he will have to work.  Here, an exception can only be for high leadership positions requiring diverse and solid work experience. <br><br>  Second, pay attention to the relevance of the vacancy to the education and experience of the candidate. <br>  The third is the matching job position.  Here it is important to take into account previous work experience, it is possible that the candidate simply ‚Äúgrew‚Äù from the previous position and therefore is looking for a new job. <br><br>  In addition, it is believed that a person who often changes jobs (once or twice every six months) will not stay long with you, and it will be difficult for an applicant who has worked in the previous workplace for more than five years to adapt to new conditions. <br><br>  <b>4. Interview</b> <br>  When inviting a person for an interview, note how punctual he is.  We meet - by the result.  After general acquaintance, go to professional questions.  It is better to prepare two sets of questions - on the effectiveness of previous work.  Try to find out if a person is able to assess the results of his work and what is the real performance of your candidate.  Ask as many questions about the results as possible. <br><br>  If your interlocutor can easily formulate a quantitative and qualitative result of his work at previous workplaces, then most likely you are dealing with a responsible employee who can become part of a team.  Such a candidate will not go to work for a tick, he will be able to clearly formulate for himself the task based on the general concept, perform it and be interested in the performance. <br><br>  Next, go to the questions about daily professional activities.  Let the applicant describe the usual working day, with which people he prefers to work, the ideal qualities of employees, colleagues, working situations that he remembered and under what conditions he could not work categorically.  Relate your responses to your company's activities.  Further, as a rule, follows a block of questions about wages, a description of working conditions, professional nuances. <br><br>  <b>5. General rules for interviewing</b> <br>  Listen carefully to the interlocutor, show interest in the conversation, communicate politely and respectfully.  Try not to deviate from the course of the interview on extraneous topics, although discharge is sometimes necessary.  Immediately notify the candidate about the number of interviews or test tasks, if any. <br><br>  Do not conduct an interview for less than five minutes - if it immediately became clear that the applicant is not suitable, go to the block of questions and professional activities, but limit yourself to 3-4 questions.  Take time to notify the candidate of the outcome of the meeting, even if the answer is no. <br><br>  <b>Be selective in the selection of staff, because this is your team and your result!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234875/</a></p>
