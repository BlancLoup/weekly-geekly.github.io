      In the sense that every situation and every task that we face in life is unique.  It is never 100% identical to the tasks that even we ourselves have previously encountered.  What to say about the tasks faced by other people.  And the solutions developed for some tasks, for others - do not work. <br><br>  And what to do? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And that's what.  Let's reason logically.  If ready-made solutions do not work, then it means that methods are not ready.  Methods that you do not know.  New methods. <br><br>  And where do new methods come from? <br><br>  The answer may seem strange to you, but it is.  They just invent.  New methods are just coming up. <br><br>  This is a creative process. <br><br>  Let me explain.  For example, let's say you have 10,000 solutions in your head for 10,000 tasks known to you.  Here you are faced with a new task, 10 001st.  None of the solutions you know works.  And what does it mean?  This means that you need to come up with a 10,001st solution.  Which will work exactly for this task. <br><br>  Just come up with.  Because he has nowhere else to take.  This decision is not in your head.  This decision is not in the heads of others (because your every situation is unique and other people never solved it exactly).  It must be created by you. <br><br>  That is, the main, in essence, skill that any person who wants to develop should develop is a creative skill.  The skill of inventing a new one. <br><br>  And this skill, in my opinion, can be developed only by training.  Regular training of your mind, your thinking, your imagination on inventing a new one.  The transformation of inventing a new one is a constant habit. <br><br>  And what is more important during the invention of the new is to stop holding on to the old, to the ready.  Do not be afraid to throw them away.  We have already found out that the old and the ready - almost never works.  So stop trying to apply it to no avail and start inventing something new. <br><br>  Yes, it can be difficult.  Especially at first.  We are not accustomed to invent new things.  We used to think that we already know enough.  Or, at least, we can find a ready-made solution in some external source of information.  But this, alas, does not work.  It just takes our time.  The time in which we could invent a solution ourselves. <br><br>  Therefore - stop the useless attempts to solve new problems with the old methods.  Stop surfing the internet for a non-existent solution to your unique problems and challenges. <br><br>  Start coming up with a new one. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315816/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315816/</a></p>
