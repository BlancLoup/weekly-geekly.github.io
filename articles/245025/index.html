  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Conversion: several useful graphs and tables</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  After a thorough manual analysis of the statistics of 146 large and medium sites, a small report was compiled with reference charts and tables.  The purpose of this note is to share with readers readers statistical information related to the increase in conversion.  The article shows some common mistakes that were made by the owners of several large sites, as well as ways to avoid them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Site design </h4><br>  Quite often, employees of well-known studios can observe the following typical mistake of site owners: an attempt to devote a huge amount of time to those factors that have little effect on the conversion.  For example, in the classic view, the most important elements of a product card are: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9c/4c4/8ce/a9c4c48ce75442a794d4903a58a5b16d.png"><br><br>  Therefore, it is they who need to pay attention first.  I will especially note that this statistics cannot be considered in isolation from other important factors.  For example, various tariff calculators, filters in the listing, as well as methods of dividing one service into several (different tariffs) have always played an important role. <br><br>  Nobody diminishes the importance of design, however, its objective significance is often overestimated.  As a verification experiment, we will estimate statistics on 11 large online stores that have made significant changes to the design (spent a lot of money and time on new templates) in order to increase conversion: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82e/c96/f71/82ec96f71bd445bf9509341e3bd818d3.png">

      <br>
      I note that all these sites before these changes had a professional design, which improved after checking A / B tests.  In no case has a high-quality website explicitly increased its conversion, therefore, a radical design change does not always lead to an increase in conversion.  It is necessary to analyze the site more accurately and be more careful in making "sharp" decisions. <br><br><h4>  Texts of the description of services and articles on sites </h4><br>  Text analysis (description of services and products, advertising articles on the site, notes in blogs and social networks) of 146 large and medium-sized sites showed that the main problem of the texts is the lack of objective consumer value.  Such a problem not only reduces the interest of the target audience, but is also not well perceived by modern search engine algorithms. <br><br>  Consider several factors assessing the quality of texts, taking into account the degree of their importance.  It is understood that the texts are correctly decorated and contain correctly selected illustrations.  First of all, it is useful to evaluate the interest of similar materials by analyzing the statistics of queries to search engines and the reaction of the target audience to similar notes (comments, views, ratings, likes) on other sites. <br><br>  Consider the process of writing effective notes on the example of the work of a psychologist.  Let the degree of significance of the elements of the structure be: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9eb/0ab/020/9eb0ab0201304b0a99403551ba8811dd.png"><br><br>  <b>We describe in more detail each of the elements of the structure:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The title of the text</b> reflects either the result of reading the article (‚ÄúIndependent treatment of neurosis for a month‚Äù), or is the question (‚ÄúHow to self-cure neurosis?‚Äù), Which is answered by the author. </li><li>  <b>Introduction.</b>  Shows the reader the purpose of the text and the expected result from reading it. </li><li>  <b>A description of the problem</b> , possibly with specific examples.  Since the purpose of a collective image of a certain psychologist is to sell services, the reader must understand the author‚Äôs competence in describing in detail the causes of the problem and its symptoms. </li><li>  <b>Existing methods to solve the problem.</b>  It is important to show practical examples of the work of psychotherapists, to give a brief description of each of the methods.  Try to show both advantages and disadvantages without categorical assessments.  It is very important not to criticize other psychotherapists, since from the outside it looks like a naive attempt to seem the most intelligent.  Write with examples, referring to your extensive experience (a significant factor of trust). </li><li>  <b>Typical mistakes.</b>  In this section, it is very important to list the possible mistakes that many readers make according to statistics.  This reception also indirectly reflects the experience and competence of the author. </li><li>  <b>Recommended books.</b>  In contrast to scientific articles for journals, the advertising type of articles does not necessarily contain references to authoritative sources, however, the list of recommended literature (from several authoritative books) will increase the credibility of the level of competence of the author.  That's just not to abuse this technique. </li><li>  <b>Call to action.</b>  Translate the sale into real life - recommend a person to come to an affordable, in-person consultation where you can choose an individual (suitable for the price and other conditions) scheme of work. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Survey of high conversion site owners </h4><br>  Owners of sites with a good conversion rate were asked to take a survey.  Please pay attention to the fact that some forms of the survey allowed to choose several non-mutually exclusive options.  As a result, the table in the database contained the following voting results: <br><br>  What indicators do you use to measure performance (choose from 0 to 3 by degree of importance)? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/494/3d8/2d4/4943d82d4152445fb825cff5cd6bfc2f.png"><br><br>  Where do clients come from (only commercial sites participate in the survey)? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/899/c16/ffb/899c16ffbf0741928d15cc83663f5e56.png"><br><br>  Which approach (strategy) provided you with a high conversion? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/378/645/338/3786453386c34c0ead9304c6dd0cb6e4.png"><br><br>  What is the most effective persuasion strategy for people? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/104/6d5/835/1046d5835aa240e8a85b5b5c14631a11.png"><br><br>  What factor helped you to create this effective project at the very beginning? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/33d/1b9/5a0/33d1b95a089d4a1c863eb4919ba1baf5.png"><br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  1. Try very carefully to investigate the situation and experience of other projects, do not be lazy to read books and communicate with professionals.  Do not spare money for expert advice. <br><br>  2. Carefully choosing people and not skimping on a decent salary - that's what's important, and everything else is a consequence of this choice.  One talented designer is more expensive than a few newbies.  One powerful programmer will help the project more (in the sense of system design) than a few people taking the first steps in programming. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245025/</a></p>
