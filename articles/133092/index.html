  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The birth of a startup. From idea to realization</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, habrovchane. <br><br>  I know there were already quite a few such articles, but I want to try to make my own contribution.  I do not claim to be the title of truth in the first instance, but something from my experience may seem interesting to you. <br><br>  Probably, each of us wants to invent and create our own website, mobile application or service, someone even tried and stepped on a rake.  And someone else collected all the rakes, and, not reassured, went to look for burning embers. <br>  It rarely happens that a person undertakes to do something and he immediately succeeds, usually just the opposite - difficulties arise from nowhere, something that seemed simple - it turned out to be difficult and demanded a lot of time and effort, and a great idea for Startup for some reason did not inspire users.  But, fortunately, there is another fact: the right path is half the battle.  Knowing that you are on the right track, moving forward is much easier.

      Morpheus: Knowing the path, and going through it is not the same thing. <br>  Loyn: I know, buddy.  This is what I want to talk about today. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Part one.  Idea </h4><br>  <b>Idea</b> <br>  It all starts with her. <br>  And this is what no one wants to pay for, but what is the most valuable thing we have.  These are ideas and dreams. <br>  Fine. <br>  Now you need to slowly brew tea.  I'm serious.  Full mug. <br>  And, savoring all the details, begin to anticipate how immensely popular the project will be, acquire an army of fans, and you will become rich and famous.  Well, if you still have a blanket, and it is snowing outside the window.  Cold November is my favorite dream time. <br>  And while tea warms your body, and thoughts warm the soul, do not let yourself go down from heaven to earth.  Have time.  And when you go down, go carefully, because you are walking in your dreams. <br><br>  <b>Do you want to do this?</b> <br>  What a stupid question?  I thought up, it means - I want. <br>  And no. <br>  I also came up with a lot of things, but if I had taken on every good idea, I still wouldn‚Äôt have done anything.  Because you need to be able to choose something that will not let you sleep and will spur to action day and night.  Any project will require labor, but if you are not ready to act deep down, the fuse will run out very quickly. <br><br>  So let your friend come and ask you about it. <br>  And after you hear your answer, it will become clear to you whether this is your project or not yours.  It is important to answer this question out loud, and not to yourself, but to someone. <br>  If the answer is still "Yes" or "Yeah" - then continue the discussion.  We, people, are often inclined to idealize our plans, and sometimes stupidity seems to be something great.  It happens and vice versa - a brilliant thought will seem ordinary to itself and you do not pay attention to it. <br><br>  <b>A sober look at reality</b> <br>  Whether the cup of tea was small, or you fell in love with your project and did not watch the clock, but it was time to take a cold shower.  Comprehend your idea yourself, discuss with a friend, analyze.  This is the same stage, without which the implementation of the project is permissible, but, for good, it is a sign of lack of professionalism and the beginning of the extremely inefficient use of time and money. <br><br>  - How many hours / days / months will be needed for the project? <br>  - How many people need to find?  And where to find them? <br>  - What will be the financial costs? <br>  - Where will it all work?  In the office?  Houses?  In the garage? <br>  - How much will the project bring profit?  At least about?  And how? <br><br>  And this is only a small fraction of the questions that you need to ask yourself. <br>  When I started my business on the Internet, I did not ask myself any of them - in the end it turned out to be quite expensive and unprofitable business.  Well, everything comes with experience.  Now I at least think about something before I take action. <br><br>  If, after answering all the questions, the interest disappeared, then return to the first point, to hot tea and a warm blanket. <br><br>  Blinded by the idea, we are often forced to wander in the dark. <br>  And instead of a hundred-kilometer march, it turns out to overcome only a short stretch of path.  But you yourself laid it through the jungle, ignoring not only the road going in the direction that is right for you, but also the free shuttle bus. <br><br>  If, after a detailed analysis, your internal ‚ÄúYes‚Äù has not disappeared, the idea has become overgrown with details and evolved - you can proceed to the stage of implementing the idea. <br><br><br><h4>  Part two.  Implementation </h4><br><br>  <b>I. Project</b> <br>  Everything will be much easier if you become the most important element of the whole game.  If you are a programmer, grab the code.  If the artist - take part in the elaboration of the picture.  If you think that you have no talents - look for everyone.  The main thing is to look.  And do not stop until you find. <br>  This is very, very important. <br>  I have been busy with all kinds of websites for a long time, until I realized how stupid it is not to use what I have.  I acted in areas that had no relation to my talents, simply because it was interesting to me.  Yes, I learned a lot, but it was oh what non-free lessons. <br><br>  <b>Need</b> <br>  The engine of progress.  And not at all lazy. <br>  If your idea satisfies someone's need, then the chances of success increase.  This can be a good foundation for your project.  If you decide to make another clone of the game / social network / news feed - without a foundation in your house there will be at most one floor in which you and your friends can find a place, but no more. <br>  Needs are different, for example - the need for communication, the need for entertainment, the need for convenient file storage and so on.  But if you do not personally experience this need, there is a chance that the problem being solved will not be fully felt by you, or it may even be far-fetched. <br><br>  <b>Quality</b> <br>  The question of product quality arises immediately, as soon as you get down to business. <br>  And on this issue can not compromise with himself. <br>  Let them persuade that it is cheaper to do so, and if you try, you can save a lot, customers / users will not notice anyway, who is looking at the reverse side of the moon?  But all secret becomes clear.  Do not miss the chance to show your project at its best. <br><br>  So decide for yourself immediately which path is closest to you: <br>  - You want to make the product of your dreams <br>  - You want to make the product of your dreams, but at the same time earn something <br>  - You want to earn as it should, and what kind of product there is - and it does not matter at all <br><br>  The first way is good, but only for those who have already financially taken place and are ready to play by their own rules. <br>  The second is the most optimal. <br>  The third - in the long run unprofitable.  And speak as much as you like about Chinese manufacturers and sellers of tasteless pies - the world needs to make a bit better, and not focus on negligence and disgusting. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I know you read the article to the end, but have not received a real recipe for getting the golden mountains.  This recipe will not give anyone, because it simply does not exist.  But in our life everything consists of trifles, which in their sum add up to a single picture. <br>  Each car has such a small detail - a spark plug, at the end of which there is a small hook-like protrusion - there is only a couple of millimeters distance between it and the candle itself, but it is there that a spark flashes (just a split second!) That ignites a fire in the iron heart by letting the car live. <br><br>  And in order to go a long way, sometimes you have to have the will to walk in small steps. <br><br>  Thank you for reading the article to the end. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133092/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133092/</a></p>
