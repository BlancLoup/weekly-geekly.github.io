      "Tuguesa" - This is a public association / syndicate of people who want to do something useful. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>- Tell us a little about the project.</b> <br>  Tuguesa is a targeted charity society.  They threw off 100 rubles each, bought, drove, and reported.  We sleep further, or we participate in the current affairs of groups, who wants to. <br><br><br>  <b>- Now the prevalence of the method of collective financing is gaining momentum in the US, slightly inferior in Europe.</b>  <b>Despite the fact that in Russia the first projects began to appear in 2008, in our country they are still developing slowly and hard.</b>  <b>What do you think is the reason?</b> <br><ol><li>  Each project in Russia, as a rule, is one person, and when it is exhausted, the project stalls. </li><li>  Project processes are hidden, solved within the project, there is no publicity.  As a result, people interested in the project have no idea about what is happening.  No comments, no criticism, new blood does not enter the project orbit. </li><li>  Vagina of the population, especially in the regions.  Fear of the Internet and registration, fear of commenting, expressing your opinion.  Fear of responsibility and change, with a great desire for these changes.  The desire to be only an observer. </li><li>  The ambitiousness of the project participants: I above all and the common cause in particular, the reluctance to cooperate, the internal struggle for imaginary power, the lack of diplomacy.  If in reality a leader easily suppresses one's opinion, then in virtual reality it is extremely difficult.  It is necessary to negotiate, but few people know how. </li><li>  Cooperation and qual.  It is difficult to cooperate with other projects.  Snobbery in relation to social networks like Odnoklassniki or dating sites.  Swing only for a long time already mastered resources.  Again, snobbery and elitism towards all. </li><li>  Fear of responsibility and submission, poor contact. </li></ol><br>  If to summarize, the development of projects with collective financing is hindered by the excessive ambitions of the participants and the lack of system quality of runet users. <br><br>  <b>- There is a popular opinion in runet that our mentality simply will not allow crowdfunding projects to truly develop, what do you think about this?</b> <br>  Normal mentality, great people.  You just need to report, show results, download and do it regularly. <br><br>  <b>- Often, the lack of good project results is explained by people's distrust, it can be like distrust of the site itself (all the money is stolen), the method of financing itself (it still does not work to collect any significant amount, therefore I will not invest).</b>  <b>How do you think this is relevant and how are you struggling with the distrust of users?</b> <br>  The collection should be organized with maximum convenience and minimum amounts.  Again, reports, checks, photos, the current discussion - everything is as open as possible.  Russia is a collective consciousness, people want to see examples.  It is useless to beat the heel in the chest with a shout of "I AM HONEST", even if it is really honest - the people have been deceived for too long. <br><br>  <b>- What obstacles to the development of the project do you see from the state (tax, legal and other)?</b>  <b>Perhaps there are any other difficulties in the development of the project?</b> <br>  None  Tuguesa is an unofficial organization, plus good connections and high-quality advice from Tugazy members.  Difficulties are possible, but after 3 years. <br><br>  <b>- Could you disclose any quantitative indicators achieved by the project?</b> <br>  Everything on the site ( <a href="http://together.ru/">together.ru</a> ).  Hundreds of people in groups, thousands of collected amounts, dozens of completed current and related projects, for all projects there are reports for 2 years that are posted in LJ ( <a href="http://ru-the-people.livejournal.com/">ru-the-people.livejournal.com</a> ).  Come and see for yourself. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄìAnd lastly, if it‚Äôs not difficult for you, please tell us how the project began?</b>  <b>Who was a member of the project team and are there any changes in it now?</b> <br>  In 2010, several users of the site Dyoti.ru met in reality with the aim of throwing money to fight fires.  And it started. <br>  The project team is one person.  Financier.  Everything rests on him, they trust him, the last word is his.  His task is to control the collection of funds and transfer them to the implementation of the action.  Each action is controlled by the coordinator, for this action - he is the commander.  The rest of the comments and help as much as possible.  Sometimes it turns out a terrible circus, but fun! <br><br>  The changes are permanent: someone comes, someone leaves.  ‚ÄúTuguesa‚Äù is a hobby, it is not a job.  I like the action - I threw 100 rubles or you participate somehow differently.  I do not like, well, God bless her, in real life in bulk. <br><br>  <b>- Could you tell us about the technical component of the project?</b> <br>  The main function of the site, clarity and clarity.  How much, how and where.  Excessive information is not good. <br><br><hr><br><br>  Read the following publication: an interview with Miroslav Sarbaev, the founder and leader of the Kroogi project, a creative community in which the audience of musicians, artists, writers and photographers themselves estimate the value of creative work according to the principle of ‚Äúpay what you consider necessary‚Äù. <br><br>  Previous publications: <br>  The first article in the series is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/145763/">an interview with the project manager</a> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">List of Russian crowdfunding projects</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  This table contains Russian projects operating under the collective financing model (currently known): <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Investment crowdfunding: collective investment</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.youmax.ru/">YouMax</a> is a collective equity investment. <br><br>  Date of establishment: 2008 <br>  Status: beta version. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>IT crowdfunding: the development of software</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://itrockout.com/">IT RockOut</a> is a crowdfunding software development service. <br><br>  Date created: 2012 <br>  Condition: early alpha version. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Crowd funding in politics: civilian control</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://rospil.info/">RosPil</a> is a public project aimed at controlling the expenditure of budget funds in the field of state and municipal procurement. <br><br>  Date created: 2011 <br>  Status: fully started. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Crowdfunding in music: support for your favorite performers</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://kroogi.com/">Kroogi</a> - you yourself estimate the value of creative work. <br><br>  Date of establishment: 2008 <br>  Status: fully started. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://thankyou.ru/">ThankYou.ru</a> - a new way to support people who inspire you. <br><br>  Created Date: 2010 <br>  Status: fully started. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://start.planeta.ru/">Planeta.ru</a> is a portal for creating and co-financing creative projects. <br><br>  Date created: 2012 <br>  Status: fully started. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Crowdfunding in charity: help in difficult situations</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://together.ru/">Tuguesa</a> - for people who like to do good things. <br><br>  Date created: 2011 <br>  Status: fully started. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://rynda.org/">Virtual Rynda</a> - assistance to victims in emergency situations. <br><br>  Date created: 2011 <br>  Status: fully started. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://my-teacher.ru/">My teacher</a> is promoting educational initiatives for teachers. <br><br>  Created Date: 2010 <br>  Status: fully started. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.rusini.org/">Rusini</a> is a social crowdfunding platform. <br><br>  Date created: 2012 <br>  Status: running. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://pomogi.org/">Pomogi.org</a> - from each donated ruble to the needy reaches 100 kopecks. <br><br>  Date of creation: 2005 <br>  Status: fully started. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Crowd funding in creativity: financing creative projects (Kickstarter-like)</b> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://s-miru-po-nitke.ru/">S-Mira-Po-Nitke</a> is a Russian crowdfunding platform, or cloud-based project financing. <br><br>  Created Date: 2010 <br>  Status: fully started. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://rustarter.ru/">RuStarter</a> - crowdfunding in Russian. <br><br>  Date created: 2012 <br>  Status: presumably launch in July. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://time-to-start.ru/">Time to Start</a> - the incubator of ideas. <br><br>  Created Date: 2010 <br>  State: closed. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://1stcash.ru/">Primary capital</a> is a new way of financing creative projects and small home businesses. <br><br>  Date created: 2011 <br>  Condition: prepare for opening. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://taptostart.ru/">Tap to Start</a> - Just tap to start up! <br><br>  Date created: 2011 <br>  Status: closed testing. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://naparapet.ru/">Naparapet -</a> should be for everyone. <br><br>  Date created: 2011 <br>  Condition: early alpha version. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://startwithme.ru/">Startwithme</a> is a platform where people come together to implement ideas and projects. <br><br>  Date created: 2011 <br>  Status: beta version. <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145837/</a></p>
