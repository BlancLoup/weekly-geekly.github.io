The participants are the militia with the Kalash, the agents, the mistress and your humble servant. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, as I planned, we wrote a statement saying that <br>  <i>I would like to terminate the lease agreement on my own due to constant contradictions and negative comments regarding my stay in the apartment</i> . <br><br>  <b>8:50</b> A hostess from Zhukovsky arrived at the apartment she rents me in Moscow, showed her that he had replaced taps, cranes, bought a new watering can for the shower.  I received a meaningful answer that if something breaks, it is only through our fault and all this is exclusively for my money, and these are my problems, and that this money is not deducted from rent or utilities.

      <b>8:55</b> She starts to get all my products out of the fridge, because some kind of pimp doesn‚Äôt click there, and therefore the fridge urgently needs to be defrosted.  I slowly begin to do the same.  In this sluggish process, in absolutely total silence, I ask her to sit down and read her statement. <br><br>  <b>9:00</b> Yo-ho-ho!  She rips off the roof.  I don't care how she called me ... I just couldn‚Äôt really understand her train of thought.  And she has 2 student sons, whom she feeds with a breast, and that she is so hard, she has a pension of 4,000 rubles, and she thinks every penny, and that all this was not in her plans, and that her sons would protect her anyway. <br><br>  <i>Let</i> me <i>explain.</i> I want to move out of the rental apartment, but without squabbles and delays, as soon as possible, under the lease agreement I must notify the owner of the apartment 30 days in writing.  This is a formality, but it is necessary for the court.  I have to pay for this month, and at the end of the term receive an insurance deposit equal to the rent for 1 month, given to her at the time of signing the contract. <br><br>  <b>9:15</b> I manage to squall screams and the hostess‚Äôs hysterics to clearly talk with my realtor and ask her to come to me. <br><br>  <b>9:16</b> ‚ÄúGet out of here!‚Äù, ‚ÄúRight now,‚Äù etc. <br><br>  <b>9:40</b> Realtor arrived!  HOORAY!!!  By this time my throat was dry, although I practically did not say anything.  It is very difficult to talk, and I don‚Äôt want to talk.  I went down after Galina to a realtor in the yard, briefly explained the situation.  The hostess at the realtor chose another tactic and shouted less. <br><br>  <b>10:20</b> Mistress tears down the tower again.  40 minutes Galina tell absolutely simple things.  That I could move out for other reasons.  Anyone got sick, something happened to me, everything can be, and that I am not like a ham, I am ready to pay for my stay.  That I have the right to do exactly as I did. <br>  <b>Attention!</b>  <b>Achtung!</b>  At first, the hostess argues with the realtor, tells something, then abruptly changes her position.  She actually tearfully asks that I did not move out, that would remain until the end of the contract, and that it will be "paw".  And that I will not be disturbed once again, and that she will be satisfied with how much I am paying, despite the fact that half an hour ago she said that she made concessions to me, giving me a rent.  I naturally do not want.  I want to live a month in peace, paying for it.  I am sick of this libisation, with my legs pressed together, to milk me. <br><br>  <b>10:21</b> Galina is a realtor, I, the hostess, a fridge - the puddle under it becomes larger (it is unfrozen, if you forget) ... Ear-ear soup!  The hostess is shouting something at the ceiling, then tears are pouring down at her.  Some kind of op is about the fact that the contract is ‚Äúfake‚Äù, there is no necessary seal there, about the fact that she will expel us to ‚Äúsuch and such‚Äù mother, about the fact that the agency sucks blood from it and receives money, commissions with her apartment. <br>  Galya is a super, bygone aunt, we with her keep calm of 2 bricks from the kirpishnaya laying.  The host yells that he will call the police.  I do not understand where our minced meat was taken out of the freezer, where the hostess‚Äôs tears flow.  Galya and I leave for a smoke break. <br><br>  <b>10:40</b> Already 20 minutes we call the police.  The precinct phone, which she had recorded was not correct, I calmly look for a phone on the Internet.  The hostess calls 02, calls the police squad.  I try to treat everyone with tea as a cordial host. <br><br>  <b>about 11:00</b> Our police arrive, I open the door for them, saying that they are a bit too much, because  hoped to see the district police officer.  They are 3 people, 2 with "Kalash".  Guys beefy, in "kirzochkah", "bronikah". <br>  <i>Remark</i> .  I don‚Äôt really like the police, but this is the moment when it's great that they behaved <i>rudely</i> .  I'm just happy about it.  Everything is visually clear who is not in his mind, so they communicated with us normally, but with her in a boorish way. <br>  <i>Brain blow.</i>  For all this, she gave me 1 day to move out, she said that she would not go anywhere and live here, then 3 days, then a week, but not when there was not a month for which I am ready to pay her and leave as quietly as possible . <br><br>  <b>12:00</b> We in the militia of our district, ... were brought under the escort of 2 Kalash.  Galya went under its own power, because  did not fit into the cop "Zhigul".  While no one accepts us, we were thrown into the militia vestibule ‚Äî me and the hostess.  After 2-3 phrases, she again has a waterfall of tears. <br>  <i>Remark.</i>  Before leaving, you need to take with you: money, mobile, contracts, add.  agreements, rent repayment schedules, your statement, <b>cigarettes</b> .  Mother, him, I forgot cigarettes! <br>  The duty officer came out and asked us the situation and just as rudely explained to her that he was not engaged in bytovuha, that it was a police department that was engaged in thugs, thefts, murders, hacks, but neither by the bytovuha and that we needed our local policeman.  The housekeeper tears the roof off the roots, no one is home, she just leaves the police, where she pulled me and walks down the street ... tears are smeared on the face, the wind is blowing, she has a veil before her eyes, she doesn‚Äôt see anything, but that goes.  I'm not touching her, calmly saying that we can wait for the realtor, she will be my witness in the case of the prosecution.  In general, it is clear that the roof was torn down and I am going to ‚Äúsurrender‚Äù to the police.  I ask for the telephone of the district policeman, Lena and Galya, the realtors, took me there. <br><br>  <b>Time no longer matters.</b>  Galya, Lena, and Monsieur, who started all this (I) call the hostess‚Äôs phones, we end up with her student son, whom the hostess is breastfeeding.  Son in a shit drunk, yelling up, that everyone now has problems with the psyche.  Realty and I are going home, singing their coffee, asking them to protect me. ... mmmmm ... dragging on a cigarette.  They recommend changing the lock, even though it is illegal. <br><br>  At this time the hostess is in the real estate agency and raises a stir there.  Colleagues phoned to Lena say that from the fact that the hostess told them that they do not understand anything and that she simply has no money.  Absolutely not.  No what.  And I pots and stsuko, what light did not see!  Because I do not respect the contract. <br><br>  Realtors are leaving, I'm going for ... um ... cigarettes.  Leaving the house I get a call from Gali, who says that it is better to agree to move out after 2 weeks and pay for these days, then get a security deposit.  Not having bought cigarettes, I meet the hostess, we go home, he is already calm, low-key, downright and lowered, we calculate for 2 weeks.  I run for cigarettes and beer !!! <br><br>  Please forgive me, I'm a little drunk, tired so terribly today. <br><br>  When I finally took a sip of beer, my hostess's husband called and just said that "spring is in women." <br><br>  With the onset of spring you!  Do not "ban", pliz, I'm still going for a beer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57143/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57143/</a></p>
