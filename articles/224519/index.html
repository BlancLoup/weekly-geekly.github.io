      Why in my own business, I was a manager, not a manager, you ask?  It's very simple, because I did all the work myself.  In the beginning of the creation of an online store, I could take orders and send them, keep accounts and bring together all suppliers, fill out cards with the goods and constantly change prices manually if it needed to be done. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A month later, the number of orders increased and I hired managers.  They took orders and filled out cards, but orders grew and grew, managers increasingly began to forget to call customers back and I, in order not to lose a client, did the work of a manager, constantly reminded them, wrote, called.  Of course, I didn‚Äôt have enough time for my main functions as a manager.  There were a lot of orders, our work system was constantly failing, we walked one circle and could not get out of it, because of this we lost profits. <br><br>  I told a friend about my problem, and he in turn introduced me to the project development team.  We discussed with them everything that I had ‚Äúboiled over‚Äù during my work, I told my wishes, some even seemed impossible to me.  But, the project manager, said that the impossible does not exist for them and we set to work.  Only after discussion did I understand how much my business could be simplified, along with which the profit would grow, not to mention a well-built business. <br><br>  So, we discussed the terms of reference and deadlines and got to work.  Installed 1c 8, which, in addition to its main function, still had the property of integration with the site.  Goods, orders were unloaded automatically when the courses changed, prices, too, we did not unload manually, as before, but all in automation mode.  I was very pleased that the training was not only for me, but also for my employees: how to fill out the catalog correctly, how to work with 1C, how to do and perform tasks. <br><br>  Specially for our store a business process was created.  I have not met such a service with other developers.  This is so convenient, everything is so clear and harmonious that I took my spirit and I realized that we could not miss a single client. <br><br>  Look, an example of BP on request: an order appeared, it falls to the customer service manager, he clarifies all the necessary details at the client and confirms the task, which automatically goes to the purchasing manager, then to the accountant, who in turn checks the payment and at the end of the manager who is responsible for the sale of goods, i.e. the shipment <br><br>  It was a business - a process in which I clearly could put the person in charge of this operation, and also each of the employees could not forget anything, since the tasks automatically fell on him.  In addition, I distributed the rights to each employee in different ways, depending on their job profile. <br><br>  At first, employees were even a little afraid of such control and transparency of work.  Some even sabotaged the work, because, as usual, the introduction of the new system causes some kind of struggle for the employees, but over time, they realized that the whole system benefited not only my business, but also them, including.  We began to work as one coordinated mechanism.  Everything that was previously necessary to memorize or write down separately on a piece of paper, everything was stored in one system.  Even the newly arrived managers saw the history of this client and could safely communicate about previous orders. <br><br>  Together with 1C connected personal telephony - a multi-channel phone, where you can simultaneously talk to several clients at once to different managers.  Another senior manager in the online mode can tell the new employee what to say and what to answer to the client at the time of his conversation with the client.  In addition, I can listen to conversations with the client and tell the managers exactly where they made the mistake. <br><br>  The most important thing in the implementation of our entire system is to show employees that this is not happening with the goal of tight control, but with the goal of proper maintenance.  Because with the increase in clients, the salary of the manager increases significantly. <br><br>  My business eventually became much easier to live.  I acted as a manager, managers knew their clear objectives, the number of clients increased, and we began to expand our capabilities and design new online stores. <br><br>  Maybe the article may seem unnecessary to someone, but it will interest someone and you will understand that it is well coordinated to work and clearly much more efficient.  You will get maximum benefits when you create the right business. <br><br>  If you write something in a personal, I will be happy to answer your questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224519/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224519/</a></p>
