  <section class="page js-page"><h1>List of various methods of monetization of mobile games</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Are you involved in game development?  Marketing games?  How many articles about the monetization of games have you read lately?  Personally, I am very much.  Articles, videos, slides, analytical reviews, etc.  Of course, it is clear and obvious that no one will tell you the super secret of successful monetization.  Just because it is not and can not be.  Just because, firstly, no monetization will save a bad game, and secondly, all games are different. <br>  The article below is a list of all kinds of monetization mechanics that I have seen in games, articles, and other sources.  Instead of sorting out specific games, I want to list as many ways to monetize as possible with a few comments. <br>  The article is not intended for people who believe that all this is the business of greedy developers, and the entire mobile gaming industry is an avid corporate scum who once buried the beautiful ideals of the game world who did not know F2P. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a05/8df/672/a058df6723e093e4f1ddbae717663aa9.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, monetization in this context is a set of game elements that directly or indirectly affect the gameplay, leading to an increase in the duration of the game session, contributing to the player's involvement and, thus, providing the player with the opportunity to spend money inside the game. <br><br>  <u>Discounts:</u> <br>  This is a classic marketing tool.  Be careful with discounts, because you can accustom users to buy only during discounts and sales.  And then paying users will bring less income, and the majority of those who do not pay will not go into the category of paying.  Adopt a mechanism when the discount can be available only to non-paying users or those who have not made a purchase for a long time. <br>  1. If your game is paid - <b>discount directly on the game.</b> <br>  2. Discounts <b>on first purchase</b> inside the game or for a limited period after the user has registered the game. <br>  3. <b>Seasonal discounts</b> and discounts for holidays, limited in time, preferably with a timer to heighten the effect. <br>  4. <b>Discounts on the purchase of a large amount of</b> goods and discounts on packs.

      <u>Boosts, power ups, accelerations, etc.</u> <br>  Boost helps the player to pass a difficult level, gain experience faster, etc.  Try to make the user perceive boosts not as your attempt to make money, but as your attempt to help him play faster and better. <br>  1. Boost may not be immediately available.  Unlocking boost is an achievement in some games and becomes a reward for the user. <br>  2. Do not forget to give <b>test boosts</b> so that the player will feel how great it is to play with them.  Try to present them as a gift, and not to impose. <br>  3. The category of boosts can be ranked <b>tips</b> , which can also be sold. <br>  4. Offer boosts on time, when the player needs them.  Examine the player‚Äôs behavior model and determine the parameters at which you should offer suitable purchases.  For example, if a player‚Äôs base is under threat of attack, a shield should be offered <br><br>  <u>Social Mechanics and Multiplayer</u> <br>  1. <b>Gifts to friends</b> .  Users can give friends boosts, attempts, and also buy useful expensive items to friends and clan members.  Paid decorative elements as a gift - undistributed mechanics, but for some games with intensive communication, it will be quite effective. <br>  2. <b>Bonus for FB login</b> .  Beneficial to you and the players. <br>  3. To cooperate with other players, join a clan, etc.  the user may require special game items or contributions. <br><br>  <u>Daily / weekly events</u> <br>  1. The <b>daily quest</b> is the virality of your game + add.  monetization opportunities.  Make the quest reward so attractive and desirable that it would be beneficial for the user to spend money on resources just today. <br>  2. <b>Daily bonus</b> , it becomes a classic attribute of many games.  It can be made in the form of roulette, slots, mini-games, mystery box, etc.  The possibility of winning a super prize makes the daily bonus very welcome, some developers provide for the possibility of an additional ‚Äúdrum twist‚Äù for money. <br>  3. Another type of daily bonus is the <b>first win bonus</b> , which the player receives daily, but only after winning.  Thus, you encourage the user not only to enter the game every day in order to collect the bonus, but also to make at least one full-fledged game, which will extend the average duration of the game session and give players an additional short-term goal. <br>  4. <b>Weekly tournaments and ratings</b> , zeroed and updated every week, respectively.  Reduce the difference between beginners and mother players, a good goal setting in the short term. <br><br>  <u>Temporary events (limited time events)</u> <br>  This is generally great.  Temporary events increase retention, diversify the gameplay and generally can bring the user a lot of fun.  If there are enough time events, it makes sense to create a calendar for the gaming community. <br>  1. During temporary events, the player receives <b>unique rewards and items</b> . <br>  2. The amount of experience and resources obtained during a temporary event increases several times. <br><br>  <u>Levels</u> <br>  1. If there are levels in your game, add a classification of successfully completed levels to <b>1.2 or 3 stars</b> .  In this case, you can provoke conditions when the user needs to go through certain levels of 3 stars. <br>  2. Level 1 or training may give an <b>award on the outcome of a successful passage</b> .  As a reward, it is especially important to give the user a paid boost or power up, which he will later try. <br>  3. Shopping and buying content for premium currency in the learning process.  They say that so you accustom the user to spend.  In addition, you can be sure that the player knows where the store button is located.  Although I personally, as a user, do not like this element of learning. <br><br>  <u>Content</u> <br>  1. It is possible that there is <b>rare content</b> in your game, for example, a difficult and long-extracted resource, very rare maps, etc.  Their sale makes it easier for the user to play, and he will be happy with the possibility of their acquisition. <br>  2. If in your game the user chooses a character - make <b>several</b> such <b>characters</b> with different skills and ideally different game development options.  The character provides emotional affection, and when it is pumped and very cool, the user may want to go through the game with other characters, and you will get doubled or tripled lifetime. <br>  3. <b>Premium accounts</b> .  This includes premium content, exclusive features, etc.  Just do not forget about the balance of power between paying (premium) and non-paying players and try to maintain equal playing conditions for both parties.  A trial premium account can act as a rare daily bonus, a reward for a limited event, or as a gift for a holiday or a special date, for example, the anniversary of registration in the game. <br><br>  <u>Energy and other restraints.</u> <br>  1. The number of lives, the reserve of forces, the limited number of builders are all <b>energy mechanics</b> that do not allow the user to ‚Äúoverheat‚Äù during a game session.  If the player really wants, he buys additional energy, asks her friends or, of course, translates the time on the device. <br>  2. Explicit or hidden, the so-called peyvola, reaching to which the player must either pay or fulfill a difficult condition (collect rare resources, a level that can not be completed without power ups, etc.), or ask friends for help.  Pretty harsh way to monetize. <br>  3. <b>Acceleration</b> can relate to boosts, but let's pay attention to it again.  As soon as a player encounters a long process in the game, for example, construction, repair, training, maturation, etc.  You can and should offer him an expedited option for a reasonable fee.  Time charges are one of the most progressive and common approaches to monetizing F2P games. <br><br>  <u>Decorative decoration items</u> <br>  1. For characters sell <b>costumes</b> , including festive, accessories, toys, etc.  <b>Decorations</b> for cities and farms, <b>tuning</b> for cars and everything you think of. <br>  2. If your game has a main character, then you can <b>add</b> a <b>pet</b> to it.  This is not only an additional emotional binding to the game and a variety of gameplay, but also an excellent opportunity to monetize the ammunition for the pet, as well as other related expenses that you find acceptable, try not to overdo it. <br>  3. <b>Decorative items</b> can go <b>in addition</b> to other purchases, making them more attractive and profitable. <br>  4. <b>Decorative items that generate income</b> in a premium currency should pay off within the optimal time and require proper daily care. <br><br>  <u>The obvious:</u> <br>  1. Selling content needed for a distant game: improved models of equipment, weapons, upgrading existing objects, buildings, etc. <br>  2. Sale of in-game currency. <br>  3. Advertising.  An interesting case is the exchange of the desired user content for, for example, viewing of an advertising video. <br><br>  <u>How not to do.</u> <br>  1. Try not to sell premium content, which gives an advantage in the game to paying players.  If such content cannot be earned, and you can only buy for ‚Äúreal money,‚Äù your game becomes very ‚Äúnot fair‚Äù from the players' point of view.  And, by the way, very attractive for cheaters. <br>  2. For premium content should not be ashamed.  Try to be proud of premium content. <br><br>  Friends, I in no way urge to use something from this list, and even more so all.  The monetization structure must be balanced.  If you have the opportunity to test it on real users - use it.  Again, the obvious things, but still.  Imagine that your game is a salad, and the monetization of your game is a dressing or sauce.  First of all, we all love different salads, and secondly, each sauce has its own sauces.  So, do not try to fill Olivier with ketchup, it will not be tastier. <br>  Remember that many successful games are based on the possibility of choosing a short or long gaming session, in many games social interaction and rivalry are important, do not forget that with time and progress of the player, the gameplay and structure of the game can and must be improved and complicated for the <b>player. see your progress</b> !  And, of course, do not forget about the high-quality, interesting (albeit for your target audience) game, designed for a <b>long game process</b> . <br>  I hope the article will be useful for children who develop games on their own and are not always familiar with numerous existing models and monetization solutions.  The article does not claim to be a comprehensive directory.  In addition, I apologize for the vocabulary, the English words and the lack of pictures.  Specify the missing mechanics in the comments, and I will add them to the list.  If it seemed to you that the passage of material corresponds to some good source, I will gladly add a link to it in the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220969/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220969/</a></p>
