  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nokia: design history</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are more than a dozen unusual and interesting models from the point of view of design in our portfolio.  We can say that it all started with joining the company in 1995, Frank Nuovo.  His track record includes studying at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena and working at BMW Group DesignworksUSA, where he was involved in the design of dashboards.  It is no coincidence that his first project at Nokia was to design a phone for a car. <br><br>  It is thanks to Frank's fresh look that the approach to the development of mobile phones has changed: under his leadership, design and ergonomics became paramount, along with functionality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7ea/6ed/dc7/7ea6eddc74fcd064886b905e1d7f508e.jpg">

      Under the cut, you are invited to tour the most interesting design models of Nokia. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b3a/418/b58/b3a418b58bfaa6b5e2c5410e8a67a3ed.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Nokia 8110 was</b> one of the first Nokia fashion phones to be recognized by the general public.  He was actively used by the characters of the film ‚ÄúThe Matrix‚Äù of the Wachowski brothers.  At the same time, the modification that appeared in the cult picture was different from the serial sample by the presence of a button for opening the flip, which was located on the rear panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/34c/46c/e82/34c46ce82cdb69bc63783c229018ae8f.jpg"><br><br>  After the release of the film, a limited batch of phones was released in just such a modification.  And in the mass sale version has arrived, in which the lid is moved manually.  The phone is still popular among movie fans.  Agree, this is very good for the device, created in 1997. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3cb/f7f/78b/3cbf7f78b84aa28ea11154af788b0dce.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Nokia 5510</b> , which appeared in 2001, was the first model with a full-format keyboard in a candybar in our portfolio.  It looked like the legendary Nokia 3310, released a year earlier, but at the same time it had an extended set of functions, a built-in mp3 player and FM radio.  The key blocks located on the sides of the screen made 5510 ideal for a quick set of short text messages that were gaining more and more popularity at that moment.  It was a one-of-a-kind model: more devices with this design were no longer produced.  The closest in spirit of the 5510 model was the Nokia 6800, in which the keyboard was already foldable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f8/786/64d/9f878664d934f2bd0bb34e0882ae6570.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Nokia 9000/9110 / 9210i / 9300/9500</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/acf/aca/280/acfaca2808e4d604152cd3f867511b12.jpg"><br><br>  The whole line of business-class smartphones, which began with the Nokia 9000 in 1996, had a common family trait: when folded, the models looked like a regular phone with a standard keyboard and a small screen.  And in the open form, they were something like mini-laptops, with a large screen and a full keyboard.  Only the first model, the Nokia 9000, had an external antenna; subsequent models were already equipped with a built-in one. <br><br>  <b>Nokia 8810/8910 / 8910i</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fcc/bba/c54/fccbbac54343614a7e9778d5165bc9f7.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b17/6db/387/b176db3879b3d499c743ef512f1b537d.jpg"><br><br>  Under the leadership of Frank Nuovo, our designers made a real revolution, proposing to use not only plastic, but also metal to create phones.  But in 1998, production lines did not yet have the ability to work with this material, so the Nokia 8810 received only a plastic flip coated with metal.  And now the Nokia 8910, released in 2002, was made of titanium. <br>  In fact, the history of a separate line of premium models, which is characterized by the use of unusual and expensive materials - Vertu, began with these models. <br><br>  <b>Nokia 7650/3650/3660</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b28/eb2/de1/b28eb2de138cee3434890dce52d82266.png"><br><br>  In 2002, the Nokia 7650 slider was a great success in the business environment, and in 2003, the Nokia 3650, which focused more on the youth audience, became its ideological follower.  The keyboard, resembling a dial-up phone, caused an unusual, rounded shape of the case.  From the point of view of design, the next model, the Nokia 3660, was distinguished by a more traditional layout of keys, however, it retained the drop-shaped case characteristic of its predecessor. <br><br>  2003 was generally rich in phones and smartphones of an unusual form.  This Nokia 7600, focused on the female audience, and smartphones for geeks - Nokia 7700 and <b>Nokia N-Gage</b> .  The latter should be discussed in more detail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c6/f89/8e4/1c6f898e424f2b73825359f1869f3ea6.jpg"><br><br>  N-Gage was positioned not as a smartphone, but rather as a game console with the ability to make calls, send SMS and MMS.  This is due to the unusual shape of its body: the keys are located on the sides of a bright color screen.  It resembles the Nokia 5510, which we talked about earlier, but in the N-Gage the alphanumeric keyboard unit was located on the right, and on the left was a joystick and multimedia keys.  An interesting solution was the location of the microphone and conversational dynamics in the upper end of the smartphone, for this feature among the people the phone received the nickname Cheburashka.  The QD model, which continues the N-Gage line, was slightly smaller in size and had a standard speaker with a microphone, so it was quite possible to talk about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/563/012/a43/563012a43087d42a7f84c75901e22755.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Fashion models </h5><br><br>  Around 2003‚Äì2004, the mobile phone ceased to be just a ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù, it began to be treated as a fashion accessory, which could not but affect the appearance of our models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c3/253/631/4c3253631bb2a1c9f273fc01cf5ebd73.jpg"><br><br>  Especially for mods in 2004, we released a series of fashion phones: the Nokia 7260 is a candy bar, but with a designer keyboard, the Nokia 7270 is a clamshell combining a plastic case with suede overlays, and the Nokia 7280. The latter became, in fact, an experimental model for women: it looked more like a tube of lipstick than a phone.  Management was carried out using the touch wheel, and the screen in the off state could be used as a mirror. <br><br>  In the future, the line of fashionable phones was continued.  In 2006, the Nokia 7360, 7370 and 7390 models saw the light. The first phone was made as a monoblock, the second one in an unusual case with a rotary opening mechanism, and the last one was the usual ‚Äúfolding bed‚Äù.  The new line of designer phones has received less defiant colors and standard methods of control, although the principle of an unusual combination of materials has remained the same: fabric and leather are side by side with pastel-colored plastic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0c5/182/d52/0c5182d522d5dc560511a6891076b4cc.png"><br><br><h5>  Youth models </h5><br><br>  We have already mentioned several phones targeted at youth audiences.  Let's recall other devices in this category. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d61/c47/3bf/d61c473bfdbe07aeec11be65c1d025bc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Nokia 3200</b> , introduced in 2003, was produced in a transparent case with unusual customization options: it was proposed to cut out colored "liners" with a special device that came with the phone.  At the same time, several ready-made liners were already included in the kit.  Other distinctive features worth mentioning are the dual oval keys and their dynamic backlighting: when they ring, they blink to the beat of the selected polyphonic melody. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fde/955/3b8/fde9553b8461bc9285fa38f83d36dd94.jpeg"><br><br>  A continuation of this model in 2004 was the <b>Nokia 3220</b> .  There was no such space for the design of the case, but the dynamic backlighting during the call remained, and the youth and sporty character of the phone was expressed with rubber inserts on the sides, behind which the color indicators were hidden.  The keys are still doubled, but they have a more convenient and familiar form.  For the same model, by the way, there was a special back panel with a number of LEDs: thanks to it, waving the phone in the dark, it was possible to draw small images or texts of several letters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/915/433/b84/915433b84212f9f1f75e23a42a51ac5b.jpg"><br><br>  In the future, a series of youth phones continued in the XpressMusic family, and the most unusual design among them is, perhaps, the <b>Nokia 3250 XpressMusic</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e7/277/71a/3e727771a1bfad94fcf109943f13eb57.jpg"><br><br>  In this model, the keyboard part was equipped with a swivel mechanism.  On the one hand there was an alphanumeric keyboard, and on the back - the keys for managing multimedia functions.  The camera of the smartphone was placed in the side of the rotary panel, turning the screen a half-turn, the screen of the smartphone turned into a viewfinder. <br><br><h5>  Concepts </h5><br><br>  Not all design ideas at the moment can be realized.  We offer to remember the wildest fantasies on the subject of Nokia phones. <br><br>  <b>Nokia Morph</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d4/b33/9be/3d4b339be1e864d00c960d6ece78bfd2.jpg"><br><br>  The device was presented on February 25, 2008 at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.  It was developed as a joint project of the cell phone research center of Nokia and the University of Cambridge.  At the time of the development of the concept, it was assumed that components for its production could be available for seven years.  Whether such a phone will see the light or not - time will tell. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IX-gTobCJHs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiuPMpEZIzOLakMLU4-JI4pGynFxg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Nokia Kinetic</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c52/5ea/9fb/c525ea9fbf472a0f204c203e4e0de1f4.jpg"><br><br>  The concept of a flexible phone, which is controlled by bending and twisting, was presented at Nokia World in 2011.  You can zoom in by ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù the phone diagonally, and receive an incoming call by simply squeezing the flexible case.  The scrolling speed of the screen in it depends on the effort, and the lack of buttons on the phone makes it waterproof.  The head of the design and technology research department, Tapani Jokinen, believed that at the moment the concept appeared, all the technologies for Nokia Kinetic serial production were already available and theoretically such a device could appear on the market in three years.  In the future, we can find out whether his predictions have come true. <br><br>  And the following two models were developed a little later, to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Nokia/blog/132391/">25th anniversary of the Nokia Research Center</a> . <br><br>  <b>Nokia Human Form</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/29d/86f/541/29d86f541e2440f2dd1361f9ebb7f087.jpg"><br><br>  This ‚Äúhumanized‚Äù concept phone with a flexible, full-touch body and a translucent screen was designed to control gestures and was a continuation of the Nokia Kinetic idea.  As conceived by the creators, the model should be able to recognize the owner's emotions and open up the possibilities of non-verbal communication using a unique screen. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/AVARCQ16El8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhUo7ZYtZfvv1z5rBIhHoZIyXU3nA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Nokia GEM</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d8/84d/e4a/3d884de4a68ef062a7155245d70d2dcd.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a7/a1d/ff4/8a7a1dff4e0351e10d1dfcaf555931a2.jpg"><br><br>  This is a fully touchscreen phone, the entire surface of which is a screen.  It offers great personalization options, even setting up the button layout.  How do you like this idea? <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZdeWK6G3p5U&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgRptTGM8q_98x6cLrgKACChHTqOQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Our days </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/965/8e6/c35/9658e6c3522a9caaa94ccd247dc3081b.jpg"><br><br>  The history of the design of modern Nokia models begins with the Nokia N9.  It was he who became the first smartphone in the solid molded case of colored polycarbonate.  This material has opened up new horizons for our designers to work with color.  The components of which it consists of, allow you to achieve excellent color intensity, with some colors may have a glossy, and others - a matte texture.  The lack of buttons on the front panel together with the molded case leaves a pleasant impression of integrity from the Nokia N9 and subsequent models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea2/330/f48/ea2330f487ccb51fccc2f88a1cb89346.jpg"><br><br>  The second notable innovation in the design was a curved screen.  Glass bevels at the edges become especially noticeable under the light source.  For example, the light from the lamp does not reflect directly into the eyes, but rather ‚Äúmoves‚Äù somewhere in the corner of the screen without interfering with the work with the smartphone.  Yes, and the finger slides on such a screen is more convenient. <br><br>  Appearance Nokia N9 was rated by experts at its true worth: the model received a yellow pencil in the category of Interactive Design for Products from the design organization D &amp; AD (Design and Art Direction). <br><br><h5>  Nokia Lumia </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/760/7fb/9e5/7607fb9e5c0c86e1aa7f924868a8372e.jpg"><br><br>  Nokia N9 design traditions have been continued in the current family of our smartphones.  The general approach can be characterized in three words: conciseness, color and skill. <br><br>  Conciseness means the presence of the smallest possible number of prominent elements. <br><br>  Scientific advances in the field of pigmentation allowed us to use the polymer as a color medium.  Lumia shells are stained in bulk, even before the molding stage.  This allows our smartphones not only to be very bright, but not to lose their charm over time.  And small scratches that inevitably appear on the case of any phone on the Lumia will be barely noticeable. <br><br>  By skill, we understand the efforts of designers to develop devices that they are making for the best layout of many technological elements in a rather thin and light body.  This is a very difficult and painstaking work that requires coordinated collaboration between designers and engineers of the company. <br><br><h5>  New era </h5><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/527/be7/dbc/527be7dbccf44d7b2848d4dabafd5550.jpg"><br><br>  Sometimes new is well forgotten old.  And in the case of our most recent novelty, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Nokia/blog/179681/">Nokia Lumia 925</a> , we returned to the already proven idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa metal case.  For the first time in the Lumia family, the model's frame was made of aluminum.  It is worth noting, the result was great! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/311/27a/75e/31127a75eef8096746941c24e262f110.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181944/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181944/</a></p>
