  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Intel Joule: details</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What does a Japanese robot barman who can maintain a meaningful dialogue with a man, and goggles for Airbus, who protect not only the worker‚Äôs eyes from dangerous objects, but also the aircraft he collects, from mistakes, have in common? <br><br>  If it is difficult to answer, here is a hint.  They have the same in common with the French police motorcycle helmet, which recognizes numbers on vehicles and shows who wears it, useful information, and the electronic panda Bamboo from Microsoft, which knows a lot of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand knows how to analyze the emotional tinge of statements. <br><br>  We believe many have already guessed: all this is created using the computing platform for the Internet of Things <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/joule">Intel Joule</a> .  It, on August 16, was presented at Intel IDF 2016 in San Francisco by Intel CEO Brian Krzhanich. <br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/intel/blog/279714/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/209/d5c/f3a/209d5cf3a94550997af3bfb66a915b3b.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you put in one row the development of Intel, aimed at the sphere of IoT and intended for those who are engaged in the creation of new devices based on them, you get the following list: entry-level platforms Arduino 101 and Intel Galileo, more advanced Intel Edison and Intel Curie, and The most powerful of all, Intel Joule.  The size of the Joule module is only slightly larger than that of Edison, but the characteristics of the system have gone far ahead.

    <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f69/bfc/63f/f69bfc63f0139f1658cb76083462d946.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Intel Joule Module</font></i> <br><br>  Joule's computational capabilities enable him to become the center of devices designed to handle very large streams of information in real time.  In particular, we are talking about support for the Intel RealSense camera.  For example, Joule is suitable for the development of autonomous robots, drones, augmented reality systems. <br><br>  Take a closer look at what has already been created using the Intel Joule. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Made by Intel Joule</font> </h2><br>  Above, we mentioned Airbus goggles based on the Intel Joule.  Their development is engaged in a company from France PivotHead.  The glasses are not simple - they can capture video and control the assembly process of the aircraft, showing the worker if he is doing everything correctly.  Intel's Diane Shea demonstrated how it all works on a report where Joule was presented. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7bb/26e/2a4/7bb26e2a454e8317fa111ba6ab26af24.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Safety glasses that control the quality of work</font></i> <br><br>  If the bolts in the casing are positioned incorrectly, the assembler will immediately find out about it. <br><br>  From the same series - a mounted display for the helmet of patrol police motorcyclists, which EyeLights company is working on, is also French. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39c/cd1/dbd/39ccd1dbdbb21cc5f5215d6c090c15fa.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Helicopter display for patrol officers from EyeLights</font></i> <br><br>  And here is Bamboo's robot panda from Microsoft, which knows many languages ‚Äã‚Äãand recognizes the emotional coloring of speech.  Microsoft Azure and Cognitive Services help the panda in these matters - the robot connects to the cloud via the Internet. <br><br>  The system runs on Windows 10 IoT Core.  Bamboo is designed as an electronic assistant for parents of children with diabetes.  Panda was created to remind children that it is time to check blood sugar levels. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/98c/b46/87a/98cb4687a4a01c0e93f983472522f53e.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Bamboo robot recognizes emotions and understands many languages.</font></i> <br><br>  Here is another robot.  It was created by the Japanese company VStone.  This is an electronic bartender who can communicate with people. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/314/874/e6b/314874e6b585b36eb8cfddceee996990.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Robot Bartender from VStone</font></i> <br><br>  And this robot from the Canadian EZ-Robot is intended for educational institutions.  It runs on Windows 10 IoT Core.  Everything he needs is in the Intel Joule.  This allows reducing the number of computers when computers are equipped with computer classes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/225/bfb/6b7/225bfb6b70b9e64d82facdbd34a34d78.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Training robot from EZ-Robots</font></i> <br><br>  Intel Canonical partner created a pair of Joule-robots on Ubuntu Core and Robot Operating System (ROS). <br><br>  Here is another example of using Intel Joule and RealSense camera: Aero Ready To Fly intelligent drone. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b3/eec/4f3/8b3eec4f3170efc34da42eb33f7f8d39.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Drone Aero Ready To Fly</font></i> <br><br>  As you can see, Intel Joule is already involved in many projects.  It is impossible not to notice that the projects are very different, take at least the fact that the software part of some of them is based on Windows 10 IoT Core, some use Ubuntu and other operating systems.  The variety of supported platforms is one of the strengths of Joule.  In addition, Intel has prepared a special version of Linux (Reference Linux OS for IoT), which is also suitable for Joule-systems. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">What's inside?</font> </h2><br>  There are two options for the platform: Intel Joule 570x and 550x.  The first, more powerful, uses a 64-bit 4-core Intel Atom T5700 processor with a frequency of 1.7 GHz (can go up to 2.4 GHz).  In the second - Atom T5500 at 1.5 GHz.  Both - from the new line.  They, in comparison with the previous processors, differ in the increased productivity and profitability. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/207/9aa/a9d/2079aaa9d526a205a956f6de0bee6336.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Intel Atom T5700 and T5500 Architecture</font></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d3/9a4/544/3d39a4544ed8a1ee509b07e6ad3714ef.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Power consumption and performance of the T5700 and T5500 compared to previous generation processors</font></i> <br><br>  The Joule 570x has 4 GB of LPDDR4 RAM and 16 GB of internal eMMC memory.  The 550x has 3 GB of RAM and 8 GB of flash memory.  Both modules are equipped with Intel HD Graphics video chip with support for 4K video capture and playback.  Both platforms have built-in Wi-Fi adapters (802.11ac with MIMO support) and Bluetooth 4.1.  Wireless capabilities are complemented by many wired interfaces: USB 3.0, MPI CSI and DSI, GPIO, I2C, UART.  In addition, both platforms support Intel RealSense cameras and libraries, while the 570x has expanded support for such features. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Where can one buy?</font> </h2><br>  Both versions of Intel Joule, in the form of stand-alone modules, will be available in the 4th quarter of 2016.  But now you can purchase the Intel Joule 570x Developer Kit (at <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx%3FItem%3DN82E16813121832">Newegg</a> , or <a href="http://www.mouser.com/new/Intel/intel-joule-570x-dev-kit/">Mouser</a> ) <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx%3FItem%3DN82E16813121832">‚Äîthe</a> one in the picture before the kata.  The set, in addition to the module, includes an expansion card for installing Joule and other useful trivia.  For example - a pair of Wi-Fi antennas. <br><br>  The same set for the Joule 550x will appear this year, closer to winter.  As for the boards on which you can install Joule, there is an interesting offer from Gumstix, partner of Intel.  Namely, the company has prepared 6 standard board options, which can either be ordered in the form in which they are <a href="https://store.gumstix.com/expansion/partners-3rd-party.html%3Fcat%3D45">presented</a> on the website, or create something different based on them using the Geppetto modeling environment.  The fee will be manufactured and delivered within two weeks.  Here, for example, their board, having established on which Intel Joule, it is possible to collect the media center. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/71c/b0a/64f/71cb0a64f9555541c08898f0d3ceb152.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Gumstix board for creating an Intel Joule HTPC</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Results</font> </h2><br>  Intel Joule is not just a collection of components packaged in a miniature package.  This is a hardware platform that is already certified for distribution in more than 80 countries.  By the end of the year it is planned to bring this figure up to hundreds.  Joule is a stable software ecosystem prepared by Intel and its partners, aimed at developing a variety of projects.  Prototypes of devices created on the basis of Joule, you can quickly bring to the production stage due to the use in the platform of the new version of the time-tested Intel Atom and other reliable components. <br><br>  If your IoT idea needs high computing power, let's say you are designing an intelligent robot, or an augmented reality system, or a miniature entertainment center, or a standalone quadcopter, or an industrial quality control device, we hope Intel Joule will help you do that conceived.  And also - we would very much like to see among the projects built on the Intel Joule, something new and amazing, still unknown, that can change the world for the better. <br><br>  ¬ª <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/hardware/joule">Candid photos of Intel Joule</a> (without registration and SMS) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/372601/">https://habr.com/ru/post/372601/</a></p>
