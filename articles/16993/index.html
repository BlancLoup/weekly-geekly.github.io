  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Self-improvement and own business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Often, various thoughts and plans that are useful in themselves, that you want to realize, wander in your head, but everything is not gaining critical mass in order to finally take action.  The problem of critical mass is that thoughts come separately, as a result of different processes and influences in different periods of time.  Personally, the map helps me a lot in such situations.  Whether your own authorship or someone else's is not so important.  The main thing is to have a general view with a brief summary of all the necessary areas of reflection.  If the map is built correctly, then each direction complements the other, expanding it and filling it with additional weight - a kind of cumulative effect is obtained. <br><br>  Actually, I recently built one such map for myself.  I often read books and listen to trainings on self-development, managing my time and my life.  Often in such sources we are talking about creating your own business.  In each of them, this issue is considered from different angles, and for obvious reasons, it is narrow enough to avoid commonality.  However, knowledge of the map of materials in general - knowledge of all parties - makes it possible to achieve a much greater effect - precisely by sharing: <br><br>  This knowledge of how skills in one method, give strength to another method, and how some ideas open access to the third.  Remember the ‚Äútechnology tree‚Äù in ‚ÄúCivilization‚Äù?  ;) Very similar - learn Alphabet and Writing to gain access to Mathematics.

      Actually to the case: <br><br>  <strong>‚ÄúThe tree of technologies for creating your own business‚Äù - a review of the authors and the interrelation of their methods.</strong> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Steve Pavlina</strong> (original - <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/">www.stevepavlina.com</a> , in Russian - <a href="http://stevepavlina.narod.ru/">stevepavlina.narod.ru</a> ) <br><br>  <u>Content:</u> <br><br>  In his articles he talks about motivation, inspiration, concentration, goal setting and self-improvement: how to spend the day as efficiently as possible - not only in terms of work, but also in terms of recreation and learning. <br><br>  If you haven‚Äôt read it yet, then it‚Äôs good to start getting acquainted with the following articles: <br><br>  ¬∑ ‚ÄúThe Power of Clarity‚Äù (http://www.stevepavlina.com/articles/power-of-clarity.htm) <br><br>  ¬∑ ‚Äú10 Reasons You Should Never Get a Job‚Äù (http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2006/07/10-reasons-you-should-never-get-a-job/) <br><br>  ¬∑ ‚Äú30 days to success‚Äù (http://quakin.livejournal.com/27734.html) <br><br>  <u>Relationship with others:</u> <br><br>  Steve Pavlin, in my opinion, needs to be read by everyone - from just starting his way, to, probably, investors turning in millions;).  It helps to organize life, relax, control yourself.  Accordingly, it makes it easily accessible for assimilation without rejection of all other authors =) It creates a good platform to throw off the burden of immediate problems and start in a new business.  Owning the techniques of Steve Peacocks, it is much easier to implement all the other techniques mentioned in this review. <br><br>  <strong>David Alain</strong> (http://www.davidco.com/) - Getting Things Done (GTD). <br><br>  <u>Content:</u> <br><br>  The author of the famous technique Getting Things Done.  Writes about productivity and labor efficiency.  The most important thing is about organizing a wonderful, clear and clear process of working with information, which is abundant in our time. <br><br>  If you have not read it, then, of course, a book in Russian: <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3221756/">www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3221756</a> and then to the forum with discussions with the questions: <a href="http://lifeidea.org/2006/11/getting-things-done/">lifeidea.org/2006/11/getting-things-done</a> <br><br>  <u>Relationship with others:</u> <br><br>  It really works great!  Checked on myself.  As if a lot of time is released from the cache, and most importantly the brain is released.  Accordingly, it allows not to die under a pile of work, but also to generate fresh ideas, so necessary when doing business.  In general, the GTD technique helps a lot when you regularly come across large amounts of information.  Thus, it is irreplaceable for any person active in the information space, not only for a businessman. <br><br>  <strong>Sergey Zatsepa</strong> (http://paladin07.livejournal.com) is the only Russian author in my review, because I only listened to him from Russian trainings.  But worth it.  Moreover, the training to Paul Graham is just as easy to get to =) <br><br>  <u>Content:</u> <br><br>  Strongly aimed at practicing books.  Sergey Zatsepa talks about how to start a business, including without start-up capital, how to generate ideas, how to look for opportunities and use the potentials of connections.  Very good "pushes" and inspires to take the first step. <br><br>  At the trainings themselves and the book is worth a look here: <br><br>  On trainings and the book can be found here <a href="http://investazbuka.ru/">investazbuka.ru</a> .  Reviews of the training (including mine) can be read on these links: <a href="http://paladin07.livejournal.com/20371.html">paladin07.livejournal.com/20371.html</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://paladin07.livejournal.com/21737.html">paladin07.livejournal.com/21737.html</a> ) <br><br>  You can exchange impressions with an active Russian-speaking community or even search for first clients / performers here (http://investazbuka.ru/forum2/). <br>  <u>Relationship with others:</u> <br><br>  Sergey's training Zatsepy - these are the first active steps to create a business - the urge to action.  Having mastered the techniques of time management and life management of previous authors, you should have time to take active steps - how to do them - written by Sergey.  I highly recommend for those who are going to open their business, but for some reason have not yet met.  If you also work on homework, proposed by the author, then you will gain useful practical skills - which is very useful when creating a business from scratch. <br><br>  <strong>Paul Graham</strong> (original - <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/">www.paulgraham.com</a> , in Russian - <a href="http://tony.stereoclick.com/">tony.stereoclick.com</a> ) <br><br>  <u>Content:</u> <u><br></u> <br>  He writes on the creation of startups, however, mainly in the field of IT.  But it is very interesting to write about the philosophy of startups.  If you have already started a business or are just going to his articles are equally useful.  Well start with the following articles: <br><br>  * ‚ÄúHow to do what you love‚Äù (http://www.gotsulyak.com/2006/02/post15) <br>  * ‚ÄúWhy not create a startup?‚Äù (Http://shadtchnev.livejournal.com/140770.html) <br>  * ‚ÄúThe most difficult lessons‚Äù (http://www.perevedem.ru/article/hardest_lessons.htm) <br><br>  <u>Relationship with others:</u> <br><br>  Paul Graham perfectly explains the utility ratio ‚ÄúCreating Your Own Business‚Äù VS ‚ÄúGetting Higher Education‚Äù / ‚ÄùWorking for Uncle‚Äù.  What is irreplaceable in the articles of Paul Graham is his experience as a venture investor, engaged in hundreds of startups.  After reading it, you can draw conclusions about general trends, summarize the knowledge gained from the above authors, as applied to the creation of a startup.  In my opinion is an excellent summary, although a lot applies only to IT. <br><br>  And, as they say, the last but not the least: <br><br>  <strong>Robert Kiyosaki</strong> (http://richdad.com/) <br><br>  <u>Content:</u> <br><br>  Great books, audio and video training for learning to manage your finances and psychology, which should be understood by a person who aspires to wealth. <br><br>  About his books I can say one thing - very business and very simple at the same time.  However, I must warn you that the first impression ‚Äî this is so obvious ‚Äî is very deceptive.  Although the author sometimes tells simple things, but in practice they are not at all obvious, until you really come across them and slap yourself on the forehead: ‚ÄúHow is that ?!  It's so simple, but I could not understand for so long. ‚Äù  This then seems obvious. <br><br>  Read the book itself: <a href="http://cashflow.com.ru/kyosaki.php">cashflow.com.ru/kyosaki.php</a> . <br><br>  To begin with the book ‚ÄúRich Dad, Poor Dad‚Äù which has already become a classic. <br><br>  <u>Relationship with others:</u> <br><br>  Everything is simple here - without competent financial management and an understanding of investing, you can hardly manage your company for a long time and successfully.  For beginners, books are useful in that they are taught to understand the nature of wealth.  For those already engaged in a small business, the book is good because it shows the further path - ‚ÄúAnd then what?‚Äù <br><br>  But first you need to start =) <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16993/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16993/</a></p>
