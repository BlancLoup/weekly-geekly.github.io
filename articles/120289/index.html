This article was written to show the process from the inside, and was prepared jointly with Kunal Sheth, a junior at the Rijers Business School and the creator of the kit for turning iPod nano into a slightly geeky watch called Paradox.  The interesting details of the creation of Paradox and the details of working with KickStarter are translated from the Kunal message. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c5/4a/c54ad0eaabe255f29f2344d31ffa90fa.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Paradox </h4><br>  It all started in the fall of 2010, when, during the fall semester, I had the idea to construct a kit for turning my iPod nano into a full-time clock.  None of the existing solutions suited me - I didn‚Äôt want to wear a beautiful iPod on my hand, worn on a cheap silicone strip.  My kit was supposed to be the best.  I began to explore the watch market and realized that the ‚Äúwatch set‚Äù was to be made of stainless steel, like the best watches on the market, and completely close the Nano case.  Aluminum seemed too plain to me for a thing of this class.  In addition, I decided that I needed a full external duplication of all the hardware buttons, like on the bumper for the iPhone 4. Based on these two starting points, I made several sketches of the future Paradox.  After a couple of months of work in AutoCAD, the final design was ready, and it turned out even better than I imagined it at first.

I got acquainted with this site for a long time after reading the news about the startup Glif - a stand for iPhone 4 ( <i>see <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iphone/119584/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/iphone/119584</a> - comment</i> ).  I looked at the Glif page on the site KickStarter.com and got acquainted with the concept of self-financing, which I really loved later on. <br><br>  To get started with KickStarter, I had to have a finished Paradox prototype.  Since I already had one, I submitted my project for consideration, adding to it information about the site ( <i>Paradox site - allgeekeverything.com - comment</i> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b9/28/b928b23ada0750cfb6ab70e279d70a37.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A week later, the project was approved, and it was possible to post on the site photos, descriptions and videos.  The KickStarter.com administration required my phone number, a bank account and an account with an Amazon payment system.  It was also necessary to independently set the number of days during which the project would be open for financing (I chose 45 days), and the cash threshold (I set it at $ 15,000). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9f/97/9f973a6232df5955ff0089774358bb12.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A remark is needed here.  Anyone who visits the project page on Kickstarter.com can make any ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù donation - that is, indicate the amount that he is willing to help the project.  Each donor receives the title of "supporter of the project."  If in 45 days the amount of donations to the project exceeds the threshold, the project will be considered successful and all ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù donations will become real, that is, they will be transferred from the accounts of the project‚Äôs supporters to the author.  In this case, donations can be both gratuitous (though rarely, but sometimes), and with remuneration.  In the case of Paradox, such rewards were pre-orders for 1, 2 or 4 Paradox sets (with the option to choose a black set), Paradox + iPod nano (the <i>player will be added for the price in the USA without taxes and any color - approx. Per.</i> ), Or exclusive set of titanium, released in a limited edition of 299 pieces.  The cost of delivery should be added to the donation amount ( <i>for Russia, delivery is carried out by DHL, the cost of delivery is $ 15 - approx. Per.</i> ).  All pre-orders will be fulfilled only in case of successful financing of the <a href="http://kck.st/easvt6">project</a> . <br><br>  After submitting and confirming all the data, the project was launched, and reporting on donations made and the ability to post an unlimited number of updates with new photos and videos became available to me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/63/c0/63c05389ad745f536d786f9bbedf62ee.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In fact, updates are a huge advantage, because over the past month I have received several new Paradox prototypes, made from different materials and with different finishes (in particular, a titanium prototype with an engraving). <br><br>  Now until the end of the project fundraising is less than a week ( <i>at the time of publication of the transfer - a little more than two days, the current time until the completion of the project, see the <a href="http://kck.st/easvt6">project page on KickStarter.com</a> . Pre-order the set with a discount is possible only in these two days - comment</i> .  After the end of the project, I will try to tell you about the final stages of the project. <br><br>  With respect to the Russian audience, Kunal Sheth <i>and habrachelovek iChernov</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/120289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/120289/</a></p>
