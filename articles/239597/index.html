It was very cool!  See for yourself.  This short movie about the confit will make you bite your elbows if you missed it :) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nRkgA97Txtk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiPkcbRx4EnAkPFtZrUbAANdTQRUA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We tried very hard to make the program interesting.  We hope that we succeeded.  The best, in your opinion, were: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b5d/12f/b70/b5d12fb70acbe430cd476659f4f96f0e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Aaron Patterson, who spoke not only about the future of Rack, but also about the new, great and powerful programming language poo-lang.  Lots of great jokes and lots of good.  Out of competition!  The gap in the vote was big. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69f/18a/69f/69f18a69f81d66f83a45565741fdfb89.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Eric Michaels-Aubert on how to optimize Ruby code.  A lot of useful tips and great slides that left no one indifferent <b>( <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/sferik/writing-fast-ruby">here they are</a> )</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87b/571/058/87b571058b0f92006f228e34ff2cc4f0.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Bozhidar Batsov, who drew parallels between Ruby, English and Russian, so that we all could take a fresh look at how our code looks. <br><br>  We have prepared for you <b>videos of all the reports - they are available on our website ( <a href="http://railsclub.ru/source">here</a> )</b> <br>  But there is one big thing: we recorded only the Russian-language track in all the reports.  And that was a big mistake.  Which we swear not to repeat in the future!  Unfortunately, the stuffing can not be turned back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cb/38e/7f4/4cb38e7f428344927f1c660e89239f3b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>A photo report</b> from the conference is available on our facebook page: we mark ourselves and our comrades <b><a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.611314918979649.1073741830.115204928590653%26type%3D3">here</a> .</b> <br><br>  Very cool material at the conference prepared by our friends from the show <a href="http://rubynoname.ru/">RubyNoName</a> .  The guys wrote down a mini-studio in the conference hall and interviewed the speakers.  <b><a href="http://rubynoname.ru/posts/2014/S06E17.html">Here is the</a></b> first edited edition, in which Aaron Patterson and Jonas Niklas lit up.  There will be others, wait! <br><br>  This year, RailsClub participants had something to do during the breaks: our general sponsor Toptal brought the suspension and Oculus Rift augmented reality goggles to Digital October, a couple of bugs could be caught at the Funbox stand, and great girls from AT-Consulting and Digital HR played great prizes. <br>  We, the organizers, also decided this year to make a themed stand and staged a Ruby Run.  It is quite difficult to explain in words what it is.  But it was fun :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a8/c8e/0bf/8a8c8e0bf6d86ff2331b7c472a38d906.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What else to say?  The conference is growing, and it is very good.  We try to do it as best as possible, although it does not always work without overlays (yes, there was a queue for lunch and yes, a couple of times we got out of the stated timing).  Be sure to figure out how to beat it next year! <br>  We tried two new formats (discussion and blitz reports), they succeeded, and we are going to experiment further. <br><br>  We hope that participation in events such as RailsClub inspires developers to new achievements.  In the questionnaires, we asked what ideas you had.  Few answers: <br><br>  - Go to Rails4. <br>  - More Service Objects! <br>  - Write tests. <br>  - More OOP! <br>  - Benchmark! <br>  - Refactor! <br>  - Participate in the open source, more contribut to the open source (by the way, the most popular answer :)) <br>  - Pullrequest performance improvmenty! <br>  - Try RubyCop. <br>  - Try Teatro.io. <br>  - Run to read books. <br><br>  Cool if you do that :) <br><br>  If you want to know more about RailsClub, then <a href="https://twitter.com/search%3Ff%3Drealtime%26q%3Drailsclub%26src%3Dsavs">look at the twi</a> : the tape was informative and fun.
