      <b>Lara O'Reilly:</b> <i>You can somewhat clarify the situation about the rumors that Nokia will be renamed Microsoft Mobile?</i>  <i>Microsoft has a license to use the Nokia brand for 10 years, but this does not mean that the company is obliged to do this (as I understand it).</i>  <i>What is the likelihood that Nokia will be renamed as a result of a merger with Microsoft?</i> <br><br>  <b>Guest:</b> <i>What will be the new name of the future phones based on Windows Phone?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> Microsoft Mobile Joint Stock Company is a legal entity that was created in order to formalize this merger.  This is not a brand name that consumers will see.  The Nokia brand is at the disposal of Microsoft, and the latter will use it in the production of its mobile phones for some time, but as the Nokia brand it will be used for a very short time in the case of the production of smartphones.  Work is already underway to find a suitable name for future models. <br><br>  <b>Blake Haas:</b> <i>Will Microsoft maintain the same level of innovation and move forward as fast as Nokia in building Lumia devices?</i>  <i>Thank!</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> I think we can even go further.  By joining with MSFT, we can all work together, each for our part, to promote innovation, which would not have happened if our companies were separate from each other.  So much good is waiting for us. <br><br>  <b>Ashisha Jhalah:</b> <i>Hi Steve.</i>  <i>Why didn't you equip the model 1020 with the best photo processing mechanism, which one was already in the processor model 808?</i>  <i>This would help reduce the time between shots.</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> Good question, because he emphasizes the benefits of acquiring Nokia.  Model 1020 is considered one of the best camera phones.  But we could go even further if the MSFT and Nokia teams of engineers did not represent two different companies.  As a result of our association, innovation will move even faster. <br><br>  <b>Joff Kiron:</b> <i>Steven, thank you for your work.</i>  <i>How do you assess the future of integration and use of cloud space devices Windows, Windows Phone and Xbox?</i>  <i>What scenario would you like to see?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> I think that people want and deserve to receive good quality work on different devices and platforms.  A good example is OneDrive, thanks to which I always have access to all the content on all my devices.  The same thing I can say about Skype. <br><br>  <b>idWinPhone.com:</b> <i>And what can you say about the future of Nokia X after the merger?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> Microsoft acquired a mobile unit, including Nokia X, to help connect another billion people and make friends with Microsoft services.  The Nokia X family uses the MSFT cloud, not Google.  This is a great opportunity to connect new users to Skype, outlook.com and OneDrive, if they are not already familiar with these services.  We have already turned tens of thousands of new subscribers into users of MSFT services. <br><br>  <b>Lucas Scherer:</b> <i>Hi Steven, it is very nice to see you again in the ranks of Microsoft.</i>  <i>When will we see the first smartphone under the Microsoft brand?</i>  <i>(at least approximate terms)</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> Thank you!  I myself am very glad to return to MSFT with my colleagues from Nokia.  Now that we are one company, the guys from the marketing and product promotion department will work out a plan for the transition to a single brand.  We cannot yet disclose specific details, but I can assure you that this will not be ‚ÄúNokia Lumia 1020 on the Windows Phone platform for the AT &amp; T LTE Network‚Äù ... It‚Äôs too long!  In general, the name should not cause difficulties when pronouncing ... <br><br>  <b>Teemu Pikkarainen:</b> <i>What about the Nokia MixRadio, Nokia TV, Nokia Camera and other Nokia apps on Lumia phones?</i>  <i>Who specifically, Nokia or Microsoft, is going to continue to improve and update them?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> We have created many applications that are exclusively provided on Lumia smartphones, but now all these efforts and experts will go to MSFT.  We believe that these opportunities make us special, so we will definitely develop them further. <br><br>  <b>Jason Ain:</b> <i>Hello, Stephen!</i>  <i>I really liked the accessibility management options on Windows Phone (I'm visually and hearing impaired), and the emergence of Cortana made it even easier.</i>  <i>What further or revolutionary / evolutionary accessibility management options can I expect from Windows Phone in the future?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> I'm very happy to hear that accessibility options help.  Cortana really should really help ... I myself have been using it for some time and I see a big difference.  We will continue to work with advanced user interfaces, and many of them will contribute to accessibility. <br><br>  <b>Mark Baker:</b> <i>Hello, Stephen!</i>  <i>What are your favorite apps on Windows Phone?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> It's not a secret that I love ‚Äúwatching my life.‚Äù  I travel a lot, so it's fun for me to see which parts of the world I've already visited.  I also like the simple <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-ru/store/app/atis/cb57284c-8c23-e011-854c-00237de2db9e">ATIS</a> application, because I am also a pilot, and for pilots it is simply necessary.  Finally, it's great to see how <a href="https://www.uber.com/">UBER</a> works through the Windows Phone browser ... I got hooked on UBER one day when I went to an unfamiliar city. <br><br>  <b>Czech Republic:</b> <i>Greetings, Stephen!</i>  <i>Do you think that Android based Nokia is a good idea?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> When we made the decision to focus on Windows Phone in 2011, we thought that the decision to promote Android would push us from Samsung, who were already walking around Android.  It was the right decision, because we really saw how all the other OEMs had moved aside during that time.  Today we use AOSP to attack the current market situation, but we have thought through our actions in such a way as to benefit for Microsoft and Lumia. <br><br>  <b>Guest:</b> <i>Hello, Mr. Stephen Elop.</i>  <i>This year will the successor to the Lumia 1020?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> Very glad you like 1020. I myself take my 1020 everywhere.  I can not comment on certain plans for the release of products, but I can say that photo opportunities will continue to be an important distinctive element for us in the future. <br><br>  <b>Pike:</b> <i>Thank you for this meeting.</i>  <i>Selling Nokia made you a significant figure, but do you think that you could give the company everything you could as its head?</i>  <i>Do you regret anything?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> During my presentation to Nokia employees ... sorry, Microsoft ... I said that the past few years have been the most difficult and at the same time successful in my career.  Like all other Nokia employees, we worked even harder and put more of our strength into this mission than ever before.  Now we have the opportunity to bring all this to a new level in the context of MSFT. <br><br>  <b>Mark Lafferty:</b> <i>Hi Steven!</i>  <i>Thank you for your responses today.</i>  <i>Nokia uses ‚Äúcolor‚Äù as part of its brand.</i>  <i>Microsoft products like Xbox and Surface are made in a conservative style.</i>  <i>Can we see more of Nokia‚Äôs distinctive colors on other Microsoft products?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> Maybe you saw a video on YouTube marking Nokia‚Äôs entry into the Microsoft team, and there the theme was ‚Äúmore colorful‚Äù.  Now in Espoo, we all wear clothes in the bright colors of our devices.  I am almost sure that you will see this "colorful" and in the entire range of products MSFT. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gpj4w9_T_Yg&amp;xid=25657,15700002,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiOXz9WMJkp2TWAOE7IkPZW49MaNw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Frederick:</b> <i>You have so skillfully put an end to Nokia ... Thanks to you, MeeGo, Symbian, Meltemi are no longer alive ... When you finally understand this, you will greatly regret what has been done ...</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> Thank you.  I know that the difficult decisions that we had to make gave rise to an abundance of emotions.  At the end of 2010 - 2011  we carefully weighed the state of Nokia‚Äôs native OS.  Unfortunately, we could not find a way through which Symbian can be a serious competitor, for example, an iPhone, which came out THREE years before!  Yes, and MeeGo significantly lagged behind and did not promise us the emergence of a wide range of new products in the near future.  We had to make a ‚Äúforceful‚Äù decision in order to allow Nokia to be ‚Äúon horseback‚Äù again. <br><br>  <b>Raivis Rasnach:</b> <i>What is your favorite Lumia model?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> Of course, I love all our ‚Äúoffspring‚Äù, but I have to say that I‚Äôm just crazy about the new 930th model (it will soon be available to you too).  The screen quality is fantastic, the sound is amazing and, of course, the new version of WP is a huge step forward. <br><br>  <b>Erwin:</b> <i>Hello Mr. Elop.</i>  <i>And how do other smartphone manufacturers convince to manufacture or not to stop the production of devices based on Windows Phone?</i>  <i>I guess they fear that many of the Windows Phone APIs will only be available for Microsoft Devices.</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> Good question.  For Microsoft, it is extremely WELL to convince other OEMs to create WP devices, and a number of statements in this direction have already been made quite recently.  Our intention is to ‚Äúcreate a market‚Äù for the Microsoft Devices Group so that others can become its participants.  So we will do our best to attract other OEMs. <br><br>  <b>vivi:</b> <i>Hello, Stephen!</i>  <i>You so desperately promoted the merger of Nokia and Microsoft that they even called you ‚ÄúTrojan Horse‚Äù in online discussions.</i>  <i>Do you somehow pay attention to these comments in your work and during decision-making</i> ? <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> As a result of this work, we turned Nokia into a stronger company with NSN, HERE and Advanced Technologies divisions.  At the same time, our device and service division now has new capabilities within a more powerful Microsoft company.  As for the "Trojan Horse", I can say that I have always worked only on behalf of and for the benefit of Nokia shareholders, taking up my post in this company.  In addition, all the fundamental and strategic decisions were taken with the support and approval of the Nokia Board of Directors, of which I am also a member. <br><br>  <b>Petur:</b> <i>And initiatives such as Nokia Developer Ambassadors and DVLUP, shut down or turn into something less significant and inaccessible to the masses?</i>  <i>They have helped many developers become successful (including me), and I am very concerned about the fact that they can close.</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> I believe that we have done a good job at Nokia, involving developers around the world in the process, and we certainly want to continue this practice.  Our goal is to continue the widespread participation of developers and maintain the availability of the initiative.  We need the best apps in the world. <br><br>  <b>I WP:</b> <i>Mr. Elop, do not you think that the decision to jump from the burning platform was made by Nokia too late?</i>  <i>Do you think that MSFT will ever be able to compete with Android in the foreseeable future?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> It‚Äôs hard to comment on what was long ago, but I know for sure that thousands of our employees also understood that we were faced with a critical situation.  We tried to do everything as quickly as possible, and six months later the first two Windows Phone devices came out.  It happened much faster than ever before and marked global change. <br><br>  <b>gimmegimee:</b> <i>One of the advantages of Nokia is the truly global presence of this brand, especially in developing countries.</i>  <i>I believe that Nokia in this regard responds to market changes much faster than Microsoft.</i>  <i>Can we count on better localization of services in these countries?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> Nokia and Microsoft are global companies, but it seems to me that our strengths complement each other.  Our positions in developing countries are very strong, and Microsoft has strengthened in the markets of developed countries.  It seems to me that this will be a very fruitful union. <br><br>  <b>Kyle:</b> <i>Your favorite pizza?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> A great moment for such a question.  It is now 16 o'clock, and after a day of important events, we are already quite hungry.  My answer: with dried ham, mushrooms, sweet peppers and tomatoes. <br><br>  In Finland, Dennis cooks pizza very well if you are somewhere nearby.  Now I am counting on a coupon for advertising ... <br><br>  <b>Domenico:</b> <i>Hello, Mr. Elop!</i>  <i>Thank you for this conference!</i>  <i>What is the future of innovations / new technologies created in the Nokia development department, such as solar charging or charging Lumia devices using radio waves?</i>  <i>Will these projects (and others) go to the Microsoft development department to give way to future innovations that Nokia has been famous for all these years?</i> <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> When I first came to Nokia, I then said about the ‚Äúplacer of raw gems‚Äù, looking at the projects of the company's scientific and technical department.  Now, together with Microsoft, this collection has become even more extensive, and it all inspires us all.  So get ready to meet a whole lot of innovation in the future. <br><br>  At that, the allotted time came out, but our speaker managed to add a few lines. <br><br>  <b>Stephen Elop:</b> Thank you all for your time and questions.  Today is the beginning of something new for Microsoft, and we all happily go on this journey with you.  Let us know if this conversation has been helpful to you.  Then we will continue our communication. <br>  Best regards, Stephen. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221883/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221883/</a></p>
