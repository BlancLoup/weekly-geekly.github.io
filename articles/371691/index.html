Winter nostalgia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92c/3cb/181/92c3cb1817364e59850bbb403709fc50.jpg" width="640"><br><br>  Welcome to the pages of the blog <a href="http://icover.ru/">iCover</a> ! <br>  Not everyone prefers to use Apple products, but few can deny the company's marketing success.  Over the years, Apple has released inspirational, funny and interesting advertisements that still want to be reviewed and remembered - more than ten years later they are released.  It‚Äôs very difficult to choose the best Apple commercials for all the time - and of course, this issue is puzzled by how loyal to the company websites and publications (for example, AppleGazette, MacWorld, AppleInsider) are so popular - Time.com, PasteMagazine and even Adme.ru.  There is even a separate page on Apple's advertising campaigns on Wikipedia - in a word, Apple paid a lot of attention to its video ads - the videos were broadcast on television and in cinemas before the sessions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is easy to guess which clips took the ‚Äúfirst places‚Äù in these charts, since many of them were received as corresponding ‚Äúvideo answers‚Äù ‚Äã‚Äãfrom competing companies, parodies were filmed on them, they became, in fact, classics of video advertising. <br><br>  It is not difficult to name the reason for such popularity - first of all they try to evoke emotions without focusing on the advertised product itself.  Perhaps at this moment everyone who is connected with the advertising business smiles quietly, knowing well how it works and why each of these videos is trying to play on the user's feelings.  The important thing is how well Apple succeeds.

      Some of these video ads were awarded an Emmy Award (American television award, which is considered the Oscar TV equivalent) and won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions Advertising Festival. <br><br>  I selected my own, subjective ‚Äútop-10‚Äù Apple clips, consisting of both classic and modern videos, united by only one criterion - they do not leave indifferent: <br><br><h2>  10th place: ‚ÄúThree iPod Ads‚Äù </h2><br>  Very often, the best advertisements about iPods are included in the Silhouette series of commercials, which demonstrate well how Apple‚Äôs marketing works: this is not about selling a product to everyone.  It is about selling emotions and feelings - in fact, you will not see the product itself in the frame, but in them you can meet pop stars - from U2 to Eminem.  These videos do not sell iPods; instead, they sell the feeling of ‚Äúcoolness‚Äù and ‚Äúsymbolism‚Äù.  However, Apple combined this approach with separate videos demonstrating the key features of each generation of iPods.  The tenth place is shared by as many as three videos showing how Apple advertised its iPods and the Silhouettes series video with the U2 group.  You can easily notice the similarities between the iPod Nano and iPod Touch rollers. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/X2HFiwfvsc0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhii3PYZ65LVRF4UbHQQ1sLnnLyaFg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EpCjCVoITcU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhj8OSx0jJhqnqWjXGnshGs1fWQ0LA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/p2Q7hiHV3O0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjFahGIuolc_3dC9hle5jyHaZ8ybA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  9th place: ‚ÄúWhat Will Your Verse Be?‚Äù </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2IaaFz4Fz4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhllrAE2uFNYnePshhxZSKTLMIMAg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In ninth place - a rather pretentious video dedicated to iPad Air.  Filmed in 2014, and showing footage from the life of extraordinary, creative people who use their iPads under the most unusual conditions, this video quotes the words of Robin Williams from the movie ‚ÄúSociety of Dead Poets‚Äù, filmed in 1989. This film received an Oscar for The best screenplay and awards of the British Academy for the best soundtrack and best film in 1990.  Of course, we do not use our tablets in everyday life as richly, but the soundtrack and video series can be called really inspiring. <br><br><h2>  8th place: ‚ÄúColors Everywhere‚Äù </h2><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lcBpXYI1r3Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhirOwZyYJkbjLJOjHnA7ieidCSXIw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This ad was released in several versions - the first was needed for Steve Jobs to showcase his new iMAC G3 during Macworld in San Francisco in January 1999, and the soundtrack was changed in the television version.  For the production of the case, colored translucent plastic was used; their keyboard and mouse were made of the same materials.  Years later, Apple continues to use the concept of having bright colors in its products - starting with the iPod and iPhone (the bright colors of the plastic version of the iPhone 5C are remembered), and ending with accessories for the Apple Watch. <br><br><h2>  7th place: ‚ÄúHello‚Äù </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/mmiWTKZzBLY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiR5VKhSFBb5P61MoqarnUqNvF43g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A short ad, released in 2007, only announces the upcoming arrival of the iPhone - no one yet knows how much the world of mobile devices will change in the coming years, and perhaps first of all Apple wanted to convince viewers that you will need an iPhone for the same thing as always - just to take a call and say hello.  The format of this video was subsequently copied by many companies, so it may seem familiar to you. <br><br><h2>  6th place: ‚ÄúComputer for the Rest of Us‚Äù </h2><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/csTjHmUqoIo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiLo2O9D--0FBWD-pRA2iFmZmup5g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It's no secret that Apple released its advertisements in "series" - one of them, this is a series of commercials about Macintosh, "a computer for the rest of us."  What is the point that Apple really wanted to convey to us?  Did it literally mean that it is a computer for people who do not understand computers?  Or was meant a computer for a non-business person?  What exactly was different from most "rest"?  The power of this slogan is that it did not matter what the difference is, the main thing is that you got the impression that this computer is for you. <br><br><h2>  5 place: ‚ÄúHal‚Äù </h2><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7RocKZKhLw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg4FtXhes3pEqI99sQpxoQtB0hREA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The fifth place went to advertising, directly referring all the fans to the "Space Odyssey 2001" - to the cult science fiction film Stanley Kubrick of 1968 (in 1984 the sequel to this tape was released).  The advertisement was made by the computer HAL 9000 itself, arguing that only Macintosh computers are resistant to the Y2K error (the ad was released in 1999, when the Y2K error was heard by most technical media). <br><br><h2>  4th place: ‚ÄúGet a Mac‚Äù </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/p5Yt30wrbl4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgsw7wwsVXpqdq8bNwJO9rgm0LhJQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Fourth place - a series of videos from Apple "Get a Mac"!  Perhaps no other video advertising ignited the flame of fan war more than three years of the ‚ÄúGet a Mac‚Äù campaign.  Of course, this was not the first time that Apple tried to joke in advertising, but it was definitely a successful attempt.  In the role of a casual Mac, the actor Justin Long starred, and in the role of an overly serious PC, actor John Hodgeman.  Jokes from these videos about the significant controversy between the Mac and the PC (like the release of Windows Vista) cause a healthy laugh today. <br><br><h2>  3rd place: "1984" </h2><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VtvjbmoDx-I%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiP_SGh0DVjUXrZ1dCoU82TpPAofA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  ‚Äú1984‚Äù - a TV commercial for director Mac Ridley Scott was first shown on January 22, 1984, during a broadcast on the CBS channel of the final match of the American football between the Los Angeles Raiders and Washington Redskins.  It uses the name and plays up the plot of George Orwell's 1984 anti-utopian novel.  The video itself was highly appreciated by professionals, winning the Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions advertising festival in 1984.  The unnamed heroine, of course, is the original Macintosh, but in many ways it represented the entire Apple company.  It is curious that in 2011 Motorola used a plot in the Xoom tablet advertising referring to this video, but Apple itself played the role of ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù (according to Motorola). <br><br>  A curious fact for geeks will be that as a commercial for the Macintosh version of Half-Life 2, a movie with a similar plot was used, but Alix acted as a girl, and scrap instead of a hammer. <br><br><h2>  2 place: ‚ÄúThink Different‚Äù </h2><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4oAB83Z1ydE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhikrG-vt4YQDug_jNxGwRfQC5JILA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This is an inspirational ad in itself, even without the Apple logo.  In the not so easy for Apple 1998, the company needed to do something to retain existing Mac users, and continue to look for new ones in order to survive.  It was Apple after an unprofitable 1997, before the release of the iPod there were still two years left, until the advent of iTunes - five.  It was this ad that made many people look at Apple products, and the slogan ‚ÄúThink Different‚Äù was used by the company until 2002.  In 2002, he was replaced by an advertising company "switches". <br><br>  This is how Steve Jobs interpreted this slogan, answering the question why Apple did not use the more intelligent phrase ‚Äúthink differently‚Äù in the slogan: <br><blockquote> <i>We have long discussed whether such use is true.</i>  <i>This is correct if you understand what we wanted to express.</i>  <i>The point is: to think not "the same", but to think "other".</i>  <i>And I think that ‚Äúthink differently‚Äù would not express our thought so accurately.</i> </blockquote><br><br><h2>  1st place: ‚ÄúMisunderstood‚Äù </h2><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nhwhnEe7CjE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjh8YSbZ2g-9zoLBxkk6aFABkJzcg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This video was broadcast during the Christmas holidays in 2013, and in 2014 received an Emmy Award in the category ‚ÄúCreative Arts Emmy Award‚Äù as the ‚Äúmost outstanding‚Äù advertisement of the year.  The same ‚ÄúChristmas spirit‚Äù, together with the iPhone 5S and AirPlay function, will explain a thousand words to your family and friends why you need high-quality video on a smartphone and why you don‚Äôt let it out.
