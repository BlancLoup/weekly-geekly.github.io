  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Buy MacBook Pro. Part two. Last one</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In my <a href="http://youngskipper.habrahabr.ru/blog/47419/">previous post</a> I wrote about my first attempt to buy a laptop on ebay. <br>  Let me remind you that it ended up with the seller who refused to send me the paid goods and made a refund, and I waited until the money came to the account.  Then I will tell you what the story of the return of money, about repeated attempts to purchase - or rather even more about the problems I faced, ended.  Maybe someone will help in the future. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I must say that I never bought a laptop in the states, I took it with me in Moscow.  So this is not a succes story.  When buying, I ran into a number of problems that at the end I was tired of fighting with them and preferred to overpay.  Let me remind you also that I needed a 17-bit, with a resolution of 1900 to 1200. And preferably a video card with 512 MB of memory. <br><br>  It all started with the following - having received a notification that paypal started the refund procedure from the seller‚Äôs account, I calmed down and continued to study the lots on ebay.  I calmed down in vain - in five days I received a letter stating that the seller‚Äôs account didn‚Äôt have enough money and they would try another 3-5 days later.  Honestly after waiting for 5 days and not receiving the money I wrote to the support of paypal asking if they were trying to cheat me.  I received advice on opening a complaint.  What I did.  Just a few hours later I received a reply from the seller that it was a paypal mistake - they didn‚Äôt withdraw money from the paypal account, but from the card account, where the money was and that the money would be in the next couple of days.  I don‚Äôt know if it was true or not, but after a couple of days, a notification from paypal really came in that they received the funds and transferred them to my bank for transfer to the card.  It was December 28th.  At VTB25, I was ‚Äúdelighted‚Äù that because of the holidays, money would not be received before January 11, and with a conscience I calmly celebrated the new year.

      The money I received was true on January 7th.  And then decided, still buy in the online store. <br>  Normal, comparable to ebay prices were only in PowerMax.  For example, <a href="http://www.powermax.com/parts/show/c-nmb-mb076ll__a">here</a> .  But they accept only bank transfer from Russia.  In general, it suited me, but the problem was again in VBT24.  The money was on Visa ec @ ard.  You cannot transfer money from it, you can only close the account, wait 45 days (!!!) and receive money.  But the way was found - you need to open an additional Visa Electron card to ec @ ard (i.e., link it to the same account), and then even in Telebank it will be possible already from it (and therefore with ec @ ard, since the account is one ) transfer money to the account.  Well, shoot at an ATM. <br><br>  Leaving the application for the opening of the card (5-7 business days), I began to consider other options.  At this time, the Apple Store appeared refurbrished <a href="http://store.apple.com/us/product/FB512LL/A%3Fmco%3DMjE0NDk5Mw">model</a> for reasonable money - 1999 dollars. <br><br>  At first I had to come to terms with the fact that upon delivery to California (namely, there lives a person who was supposed to bring me a laptop to Russia), I have to pay a tax of +167 dollars.  But I decided to buy all the same.  But not so simple.  When registering there, you need to specify billing adress - and you cannot choose another country other than the United States.  When they make a request to withdraw funds from a credit card, they also give the given address, and the bank rejects the transaction.  At least VTB24.  Dead end. <br><br>  All this time, I also continued to send inquiries to sellers of lots on ebay - whether they can send goods to an unconfirmed address.  True changed the wording.  I asked if they could send the goods to my business address (the address of a well-known company in California), then clarified that it would not be comformed.  Somewhere on the 20th attempt, one of the vendors agreed.  True, it was his first lot - which strained a little.  Nevertheless, I won this lot and tried to make a payment - but it was not there.  It turned out that visa ec @ ard in VTB24 has a limit on the maximum amount of transactions per month (it is also on the maximum transaction) - 60 thousand rubles.  Let me remind you that the card is tied to a dollar account.  If before NG I had enough of this for my eyes, then already in January, due to the growth of the dollar, the limit was not enough.  It is impossible to increase the limit.  Moreover, this limit was increased only in November last year, and before that it was 500 (!!!) dollars.  And the bank does not know about it.  I explained the situation to the seller - he quickly offered to pay how much is now, and the rest after 7 days when another month comes.  In general, I tend to trust people, but in this case I decided to check - and started a correspondence with the paypal caliper.  The question was whether the buyer protection plan would work if I made the payment in installments.  It should be noted that the caliper does not respond quickly - from a day to two.  And not clearly.  I spent five days to bring my problems, but it seems I did not understand.  The meaning of the answers was the same - they say you pay only through the ‚Äúpay‚Äù link on ebay and everything will be fine. <br>  While I corresponded with the caliper, the seller lost interest in me and set the lot again. <br><br>  Well, then in the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_macsale/">commune ru_macsale</a> I saw the offer of the laptop that I needed for 2300, almost new, from Canada - and took it from the hands of a person.  Finita la comedy. <br><br>  He made an engraving in a company on the Savelovsky market ‚Äî 600 rubles, but the truth was, I asked in the lower right corner, they made it upside-right.  Illumination through Russian letters shines through - the truth is a little more dim. <br><br>  Of unpleasant surprises - this is a very small angle of opening the screen.  In fact, I can't work lying down - I used to open my laptop at 170 degrees and put my knees on my stomach.  So you can fully print.  But this is an amateur.  But the fact that the screen is very light is no longer pleasant.  Almost every time you transfer a laptop, the lid tries to close. <br>  From pleasant laptops narrower than my seser acer, more easy. <br><br>  Installed Vista.  While from the desktop I pass slowly.  Here is the last month, I am leaving for free swimming. <br>  I will develop for MacOS shareware, and games for iPhone.  So if you don‚Äôt have a small utility under the poppy, well, with an idea.  I promise 5% from the first year of sales :) <br><br>  In MacOS, while mastering ... a lot of misunderstandings ... But probably it is still a matter of habit. <br><br>  PS I would be grateful if you give a link to any <b>kindly</b> community where you could ask simple questions to the switcher?  Search in Google is somehow difficult.  I am writing a simple question "How to increase system fonts in mac os", I get a bunch of links to flames where the fonts are better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/51164/">https://habr.com/ru/post/51164/</a></p>
