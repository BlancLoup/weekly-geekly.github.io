  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Simple timekeeping: service to control time</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have never been a fan of time management and strict daily routines.  Probably, like many, I have all been associated with wild tediousness and people-robots who live on schedule, constantly look at the clock and write something in the diary.  I tried many things, was fond of various things, lived in completely different rhythms with different number of daily tasks.  As a result, I realized that in life I want to achieve too many goals, to develop in several directions at once, often unrelated to each other.  For example, I am interested in: programming, design, business, sports, fiction and philosophy, music, development of communication skills, respectively, the work itself :) The current level in each of the areas is completely different.  Now imagine that time is a resource, and attention is a controller that allocates this resource to any of the directions at some point in time. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  How is the process going on at me and, most likely, at many of you, especially if you are a freelancer and work from home?  During the day, the controller behaves like a tape measure, randomly allocating time to one or the second direction.  In the morning you start working, then get distracted and read the Habr, then climbed to some forum and write a post, work again, then you were distracted by referring to an interesting book and you read again.  It is time for lunch, then you try to work, but defrosted still rolls on watching a bashorga or chatter in ICQ, after an hour or two you take yourself in hand and work again.  Periodically, you have some ideas, you remember something by abstract interests, find docks and read them for 15-20 minutes.  By the end of the day you ask yourself the question: what and how much time did I do during the day?  Very often it turns out that you really did not do anything.  Attention jumped from one task to another, and you absolutely did not control this process.  From here I came to the following conclusions (it should be noted that they are not the discoveries of America and, for certain, similar ideas appear in the time management literature): <br><br>  1. Strictly prioritize.  Maybe you need to do something this month / year, and something can be postponed to the next 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      2. It is necessary to divide the resource into portions or time periods for each of the directions (reading, chatter, project No. 1 ...) <br><br>  3. In each period of time to strive to engage in only one direction. <br><br>  4. No matter how hard you try, there will still be breakdowns.  You need to control how much time you take each direction to understand how you spend your time.  In addition, this control disciplines great. <br><br>  If the first three points are strictly individual, then I wrote a simple service to help the fourth: <a href="http://chronoman.ru/">chronoman.ru</a> . <br>  The point is simple: you create tasks for which you spend time during the day and celebrate when you start to do them, and when you stop - you stop.  This is like a set of stopwatches for each of your projects, cases or useless time makers. <br><br><img src="http://chronoman.ru/job_list2.png"><br><br>  As you can see from this picture, I have been writing this small post for 46 minutes already :) <br><br>  You can get the statistics of the time spent, for any period, as a proportional ratio of the time spent: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4b7/465/a46/4b7465a4666ee63add34f7cf0b3cd725.png"><br><br>  Or, taking into account unaccounted time: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ae4/0e0/55c/ae40e055cd9d5e4b84f9d59919cbf4c0.png"><br><br>  Of course, this scheme is not for everyone.  The use of such a service is associated with a number of inconveniences, the most important of which is to monitor it, constantly marking the tasks and stopping them when you are finished.  Yes, and many people are most effective in an atmosphere of creative chaos.  Therefore, this service does not pretend to anything, I wrote it more for myself, but I will be glad if it is useful to you. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/55581/">https://habr.com/ru/post/55581/</a></p>
