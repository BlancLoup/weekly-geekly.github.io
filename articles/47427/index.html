Meanwhile, about a month ago, the release of the 3rd version (number 1.3) was released. <br><br>  What is it different from phpBB, iPB and others?  According to the developers, the main vectors for the development of the engine are lightness, compactness and lack of graphic "tricked". <br>  Pure PunBB is quite limited in functionality, but at the same time it, as stated, works quickly, and the output code is good: the doctype is XHTML 1.0 Strict, beautiful layout on divs, microformats in profiles and other goodies. <br>  But no one forces us to use it in its pure form.  And extensions to it are also available, and with the installation in two clicks. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Some history and personal experience </h4><br>  The ‚Äúzero‚Äù version (1.0) of PunBB appeared in August of 2003.  However, hardly anyone knew much about her. <br><br>  And already on January 3 (creepiness!) Of 2004, version 1.1 appeared. <br>  At that time it was a very nice engine.  But its main drawback (like 1.2 later) was the need to edit the code of the engine for installing extensions.  As a result, when I started to refine the forum on PunBB 1.1, I did not dare to transfer it to 1.2, right up until the very close of the [forum]. <br>  New versions and fixes 1.1 were released within six months.

      January 8 (this time they celebrated the New Year :)) 2005, version 1.2 was released.  It seemed to me, when I was messing with it, in general, the development trends of the forum were quite correct, but still he did not catch me.  As a result, PunBB 1.2 continued to develop without me, and I continued to pick version 1.1.  :) <br><br>  By the end of January of this year (2008), beta version 1.3 has finally come out.  But the main developer has ceased to devote enough time to the engine.  After this, various upheavals occurred, as a result of which the FluxBB project was separated in May.  Then everything seems to be back, but with a different development team.  As a result, the path from beta to release took almost a year, but still this path was covered. <br>  The FluxBB project at the moment also exists, but has not yet emerged from the beta state (and will it be released?). <br><br><h4>  What do we want? </h4><br>  Of course, PunBB needs PHP (version 4.3.0 or higher).  As a database, it perceives: <br><ul><li>  Mysql </li><li>  PostgreSQL </li><li>  Sqlite </li></ul>  ... which I think is quite enough. <br><br><h4>  What can we do? </h4><ul><li>  Valid XHTML + CSS on output </li><li>  Multilingual support (UTF-8) </li><li>  Support for extensions that do not require code editing (on hooks) </li><li>  CSS Themes </li><li>  hCard in user profiles </li><li>  ... well, all the minimum functions that are required from the forum </li></ul><h4>  Is it worth it? </h4><br>  Is it worth it to install it now?  I decided for myself - it is worth it, and did not regret it.  Version 1.3 was extremely pleasant to handle.  I will not argue that it is fundamentally better than other engines, but it is really good. <br><br>  However, I will not omit sufficiently important information: <br>  - First, at the moment Russification is not yet complete.  Although, it is more likely to refer to uncritical cavils than to obvious crime, because the main part is already ready. <br>  - Secondly, not all extensions that I would like to see are written for the new version.  But only a month has passed, and the process is moving fast enough. <br><br>  And still try.  What if you like it too?  :) <br><br><h4>  Links </h4><ul><li>  <a href="http://punbb.informer.com/">PunBB official website</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://punbb.ru/">Russian support forum site</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://fluxbb.org/">FluxBB website</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PunBB">About PunBB in English Wikipedia</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47427/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47427/</a></p>
