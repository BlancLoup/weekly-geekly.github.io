      So, now you need to collect your thoughts and go into the office.  I know what I have to see there, because it repeats from time to time, day after day.  As always, the soul has a little anxiety.  Maybe something will change today?  Maybe today will be wrong?  But this question I ask myself every time I come to school and constantly everything that I am so afraid of is repeated again and again.  It remains to take the last step to fall into the hands of a terrible evil.  The doorknob is so cold ... <br>  As usual in the classroom, due to the chatter of the students, it is no less noisy than outside and immediately after my appearance in the office the views of my classmates were illuminated.  Moreover, this look is difficult to describe; it is not as lively and joyful as children usually have, but hard and intense, as if they are expecting something from me.  Of course, you hate me as much as I hate you.  You need attention, understanding, while you are not ready to give it in relation to another.  You are only interested in yourself and you do not care about the others, everything, everything and everything should always do everything for you.  And you are not even ready to move your finger to help another, if it does not bring you any good. <br>  As usual, apologize for being late, and the teacher did not even respond.  Of course, a person who is always late, why give him more attention than just a bold and judgmental look?  Surely now in the thoughts of the teacher reasoning about who I can become in the future with such an attitude towards time and life.  It seems to you that I will not succeed, and I will not achieve anything, that I am not interested in anything in this life, except computers ... and you know what I want to say, yes, this is true, but it suits me perfectly.  Or maybe not?  I do not understand ... <br>  I quietly walk to my backstage, where as always lonely, always alone.  Once this year I had a neighbor on the desk, and even that, because he was put there, because he was noisy and talked to a neighbor, and I don‚Äôt have much to talk with.  The ideal partner for creating silence in the classroom, are those needed by the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù?  Quiet and submissive?  But statistics show that just such people tend to commit crimes.  But of course this does not interest you ... <br>  Time in the classroom flows very slowly, painfully, through the voice of the teacher, who speaks and draws something at the blackboard.  But for me this is all completely uninteresting, there is no desire to even try to understand it.  I remember the experience of other countries where there are subjects of choice, oh, how great it would be if we had such a thing, because just recently our education system was one of the most respected, and now it is not suitable even a candle.  It is terrible, it is worse to live, it is harder to live, no, let's say, to survive, it will be more correct.  It is terrible to live when you are trying to make a robot, a creature without a mind, without a desire to think or reason.  Everyone needs you to obey and do what they tell you, they don't care about the rest. <br>  Call  He is so loud that he constantly wants to jump up and run away, close his ears.  A piece of iron, beating on another piece of iron and extracting this terrible, loud, unbearable and constantly identical sound.  Again, I would like to recall the practice of other states that have already introduced music instead of a call.  Calm, measured, not straining and not frightening to the depth of the bones.  But apparently this is still far away for us ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87071/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87071/</a></p>
