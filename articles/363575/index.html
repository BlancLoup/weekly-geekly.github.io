    </i>  <i>And as always, we are waiting for your wishes and comments in the comments!</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Letting IELTS</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e3/544/4dd/2e35444dd11648678d3adbd8a6103e7c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  IELTS exam is passed in the official test centers.  To date, there are 1500 such centers located in different countries of the world.  There are two official centers in Moscow: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Students International IELTS Test Center, located at ul.  Chipok, house 20 (304 office); <br>  ‚Ä¢ BKC IELTS Test Center, which is located on ul.  Myasnitskoy, house 24/7. <br><br>  <i>To register for the exam, you must submit the following documents to the center no later than 35 days before the test:</i> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ a special questionnaire filled out personally by the candidate; <br>  ‚Ä¢ the contract completed in duplicate.  The tester will receive his copy of the contract on the day of the exam; <br>  ‚Ä¢ a photocopy of the passport (passport is preferable).  The passport number is indicated in the application form, therefore the passport must be taken on <br>  the exam, otherwise, the examiner will not be allowed to take the test; <br>  ‚Ä¢ two color photos; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Receipt of payment. <br><br>  It is important to keep in mind that payment for the test is not a guarantee of successful registration - in addition to the receipt of funds on the account, you must provide a package of necessary documents before the end of registration on the date chosen by the candidate. <br><br>  The application form and the contract can be obtained directly at the delivery center or downloaded from the official site.  At the end of 2011, a compulsory procedure for photographing and scanning a fingerprint before the exam was introduced for test participants.  Such security measures exclude the possibility of passing the exam by another person.  Educational institutions can be sure that they have a certificate of the candidate who passed the test. <br><br>  The cost of the exam in Moscow is 9,000 rubles, in the regions this price can reach up to 15,000 rubles.  You must bring your passport for the exam.  The document number and data in it must match the data provided during registration for the exam. <br><br>  It is possible to transfer or cancel the test delivery no later than five weeks before the appointed date, otherwise the money transferred will not be refunded.  An exception is the case when the candidate did not attend the IELTS exam for good reasons, such as illness or other irresistible circumstances.  The second in this case include terrorist acts or natural disasters, such as earthquakes, floods, dust storms, avalanches, landslides, etc. If the document that the candidate could not attend the exam was provided to the test center, then the money will be returned for deduction of the registration fee. <br><br>  The test duration is 2 hours and 45 minutes; it consists of four parts: Writing, Speaking, Listening, Reading.  The candidate must appear on the exam on the appointed day 20 minutes before the start of the test.  Candidates who are late for the exam or do not have these documents will not be allowed to take the test.  Technical devices, including phones and tablets, cannot be taken for the exam, otherwise they will become a reason for removal from the exam.  All the necessary tools are issued immediately before the test, so there is no need to worry about papers and pencils.  In the process of passing the test, you must observe absolute silence. <br><br>  <b>Test results</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/208/fd6/e96/208fd6e96a0f4e838111407e9c6e6e1c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The test results are ready 10 working days after delivery and are issued in the form of a certificate, which is considered valid for two years.  The certificate can be obtained in person at the center or via courier mail.  Five copies of the certificate are sent free of charge by the center indicated by the candidate institution or organization.  The remaining copies are paid.  One copy costs 1350 rubles and is made within 1 day. <br><br>  <b>Appeal</b> <br><br>  If a candidate is not satisfied with his result and considers it unfair, he can challenge him by filing an appeal within six weeks after the test date or within four weeks after receiving the results.  The cost of the appeal depends on which center you take the test (for example, at the Students International IELTS Test Center it is 5,500 rubles), the application processing time is 6-8 weeks.  You can appeal any number of sections of the test - the cost of the procedure does not change.  If the decision is made in favor of the appealing party, the cost of the appeal is returned to the candidate in full. <br><br>  <i>In the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/ielts-ili-toefl-chto-vybrat/">final</a> IELTS <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/ielts-ili-toefl-chto-vybrat/">publication,</a> we will compare the TOEFL and IELTS exams, discussing their differences and similarities.</i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363575/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363575/</a></p>
