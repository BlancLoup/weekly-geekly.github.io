      The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application came to William when he brought the included AM receiver to a room with a laptop and noticed noise in the sound. <br><br>  The program uses <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">rectangular modulation</a> , and the transmission quality depends on the selected frequency and on the equipment used. <br><br>  The creator of the program was Macbook Air 2015 and receiver Sony STR-K670P.  For this set of equipment, the frequency of 1580 kHz AM worked best.  Entriken was able to achieve a stable signal transmission over a distance of up to two meters (or one meter, if the path is blocked by a plasterboard wall). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mz/i-/im/mzi-immry6pyigqrvem2pbuucve.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/arul72/32125269011/">Arul Irudayam</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br>  William's experiment interested people from different countries.  Now they <a href="http://tenwatts.blogspot.com/2018/01/system-bus-radio.html">send the</a> author the test results of the program on other devices and in other conditions. <br><br><h2>  A brief history of "computer radio" </h2><br>  In 1959, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_1401">IBM 1401</a> computer went on sale.  The memory of this ‚Äúmachine‚Äù was programmed in such a way that it began to emit electromagnetic waves.  This signal could be ‚Äúrecognized‚Äù with the help of a radio receiver. <br><br>  The father of the Icelandic composer Johann Johannson (J√≥hann J√≥hannsson) using this feature IBM 1401 recorded several tunes.  Later, these records were <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9583-ibm-1401-a-users-manual/">discovered</a> by Johan himself, and they formed the basis of his 2006 album entitled ‚ÄúIBM 1401, A User's Manual‚Äù.  Under his music even <a href="https://www.wired.com/2007/06/ibm1401-musical/">put</a> dance. <br><br>  The method of extracting sound from a computer through hardware components is also described in Steven Levi‚Äôs <a href="https://books.google.ru/books%3Fid%3DmShXzzKtpmEC%26lpg%3DPA206%26dq%3DSteve%2520Dompier%26hl%3Dru%26pg%3DPA171">book</a> Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution. <br><br>  In 1976, one of the members of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_Computer_Club">Homebrew Computer Club</a> computer lovers club Steve Dompier created the program for Altair 8800, which allowed him to write music and broadcast it to the radio. <br><br>  At one of the club's meetings, he played the song The Beatles ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DfgYhVnmeWrk">Fool on the Hill</a> ‚Äù.  According to the recollections of the participants of the Homebrew Computer Club, a successful experiment with the Altair 8800 seemed to them the first sign that they could change the history of computers. <br><br>  Steve described this experience in his <a href="http://vintagecomputer.net/cisc367/dr%2520dobbs%2520feb%25201976%2520Music%2520With%2520Altair.pdf">article for Dr.</a>  <a href="http://vintagecomputer.net/cisc367/dr%2520dobbs%2520feb%25201976%2520Music%2520With%2520Altair.pdf">Dobb's Journal</a> , which inspired other people to create music: after publishing, he received more than four hundred calls from enthusiastic enthusiasts. <br><br>  A year later, in 1977, Dompierre created the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dy_E5UnCVll8">Target</a> game for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol-20">Sol-20</a> computer.  The essence was simple: at the bottom of the screen there was a cannon, from which it was necessary to shoot at the monsters flying past.  In this project, Dompierre used his previous experiments with music.  Users could put an AM receiver near the computer, tune it to the desired frequency and hear the sound effects of the game. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_E5UnCVll8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In the Altair 8800 and Sol-20 emitter acted <a href="http://www.historyofpersonalcomputing.com/hands-on-museum/processor-technology-sol/">bus</a> S-100.  She was in other computers at that time.  Therefore, many could experiment with "computer sound".  For those who wanted to study this issue more seriously, a number of companies offered special equipment.  For example, Newtech released <a href="http://www.s100computers.com/Hardware%2520Manuals/Newtech/Newtech%2520Music%2520Board.pdf">boards</a> that <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6048.html">amplified the</a> signal and made it possible to connect a computer to an external audio system. <br><br><h2>  Other "computer" ways to create music </h2><br>  To play music using electromagnetic radiation, you can use not only the internal components of the computer.  In 2001, Erik Thiele created Tempest for Eliza for Linux, which played music using electromagnetic radiation from a monitor. <br><br>  For this purpose, special images were used, with the display of which the electron beam current of the kinescope took the form close to the low-frequency (unit-tens MHz) AM signal.  Initially, this method of signal interception was designed for CRT monitors, but the program also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DoLQbp6hj7-c">works</a> with LCD screens. <br><br>  Other retro equipment, such as a dot matrix printer, can also be turned into a <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6074.html">musical instrument</a> .  They record covers of famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DgSHD_haVxkI">songs</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DVXbP7OkQ8LQ">soundtracks</a> .  For them, <a href="https://youtu.be/gJieLDLG05o">writing</a> original works. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gJieLDLG05o" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  A source of inspiration musicians and composers also found in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DG081hD0nwWE">sound of</a> floppy drives.  With the help of these devices <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/12/06/floppy-drive-music-by-emmy-winning-composer/">,</a> even the movie composer Bear McCreary (Bear McCreary) <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/12/06/floppy-drive-music-by-emmy-winning-composer/">created the</a> music: he used the "flop" to write the soundtrack for the <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5943.html">movie</a> "Uprising". <br><br>  On the net, you can <a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/make-floppy-drive-music">find guidelines</a> for creating an Arduino-based system that will play music on 3.5 "floppy disk drives. A program for managing the resulting tool can be found on <a href="https://github.com/SammyIAm/Moppy2">GitHub</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  Such decisions show that music <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5884.html">surrounds</a> us literally, and it only needs to be heard. </blockquote><br><hr><br>  ‚ÄúAudiomania‚Äù in Telegram - about sound and gadgets in microformat: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png">  <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/625">Cinema on the plates</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png">  <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/624">Sounds from the world of nightmares</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png">  <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/622">Built-in Acoustics Guide</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png">  <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/621">How Star Wars Sounded</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png">  <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/610">Music at work</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png">  <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/601">Brand history: Marshall</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png">  <a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/607">Unusual audio gadgets</a> <br><br><hr></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/421723/">https://habr.com/ru/post/421723/</a></p>
