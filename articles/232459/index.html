      The main task of our <b>DevCamp</b> stream was to develop and present the concept of an IT project during our stay. <br>  However, in addition to working on the main project, there was a desire to digress a little ... <br><br><h1>  Problem: one serving is obviously not enough. </h1><br>  This year, there was an innovation on the territory of the forum‚Äôs dining room: it was possible to eat only once (once for breakfast, one for lunch and one for dinner). <br>  The control was carried out at the entrance with the help of a specially trained person and MK with a reader to which you need to attach a personal badge with a rfid tag. <br><br>  If the green LED lights up, they let in food, if the red one does not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07f/343/b73/07f343b737894db9bdd6a720a23b05aa.JPG"><br>  <i>Figure 1 (Microcontroller responsible for the pass)</i> <br><br>  I wanted to influence this situation, and I did it. <br><br><h1>  Analysis of the decision making algorithm passes to food </h1><br>  The first thing I noticed is the patchcord that was leaving the MC.  I walked a bit along the way. <br>  This led me to the far corner of the dining room, where the router hung. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/47d/193/b2a/47d193b2a9654fe29b319d8e85085123.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.2 (Router in the corner of the dining room tent)</i> <br><br>  When the feeding time was over, and the dining room was free of people, I connected to the free port in the hope of getting a password from the WiFi network to continue my research without attracting too much attention - away from the dining room.  It turned out that the router was reflashed in DD-WRT and the standard passwords in its admin panel were changed, for this reason I had to continue while sitting in the dining room. <br><br><h2>  Network scan </h2><br>  DHCP on the router was supposedly turned off, or there were filters, because my laptop address was not given.  As it turned out, device addressing was standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b6/d93/47f/0b6d9347f24e409995b67bd16bdc850f.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 3 (Network scan result)</i> <br><br>  It was not difficult to guess which addresses MK can have (there are two, one from the left and one from the right entrance to the dining room). <br>  There were three candidates: 192.168.1.  <b>130</b> , 192.168.1.  <b>120</b> and 192.168.1.  <b>112</b> <br><br><h2>  Traffic analysis </h2><br>  Using ARP-Poisoning technology, I suppressed traffic between the gateway and the alleged MK through myself.  And very quickly able to catch the right package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/694/0fc/b99/6940fcb9934f4856a4e16b81b3a4c21e.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.4 (The original dialogue between the MK and the server)</i> <br><br>  As it turned out, the server erp.labadabadoo.ru is responsible for making the decision.  MK sends HEAD request in the format <b>/ skud / meal /? Id =</b> <i>{rfid tag identifier}</i> .  In response, the server sends either the code <b>‚Äú200‚Äù</b> and the green LED lights up on the MC, or <b>‚Äú403‚Äù</b> - then the red one lights up. <br><br><h2>  We affect the situation </h2><br>  Apache was installed for this and a DNS-Spoofing attack was applied.  Now the erp.labadabadoo.ru <b>hostname was</b> resolved as 192.168.1.99 (my laptop) and my local Apache always answered <b>‚Äú200‚Äù</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1a/d11/26d/f1ad1126db4f405e810c17a1959b8152.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 5 (DNS-Spoofing in action)</i> <br><br>  The final result can be seen below.
