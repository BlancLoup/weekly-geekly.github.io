Some of them managed to give up on big data, others - on the contrary, make the most of their use for business ... A fresh analytical review of the domestic and global Big Data market, prepared by the Moscow Exchange together with <a href="http://www.ipoboard.ru/">IPOboard</a> analysts, shows which trends are most relevant in the market today. .  We hope the information will be interesting and useful. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>WHAT IS BIG DATA?</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>Key features</b> </h5><br>  Big Data, at the moment, is one of the key drivers of information technology development.  This trend, relatively new to Russian business, has become widespread in Western countries.  This is due to the fact that in the era of information technology, especially after the boom of social networks, a significant amount of information began to accumulate on every Internet user, which ultimately led to the development of Big Data. <br><br>  The term ‚ÄúBig Data‚Äù causes a lot of controversy, many believe that it means only the amount of accumulated information, but do not forget about the technical side, this direction includes storage technologies, calculations, as well as services. <br><br>  It should be noted that it is the processing of a large amount of information that is difficult to handle in traditional ways *.

      Below is a comparative table of the traditional and the Big Data database. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba3/c89/279/ba3c892798df4d51b7bee8a01a528122.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The scope of Big Data is characterized by the following features: <br>  <u><b>Volume</b></u> - the volume, the accumulated database is a large amount of information that is time-consuming to process and store in traditional ways, they require a new approach and improved tools. <br>  <u><b>Velocity</b></u> - speed, this attribute indicates both the increasing data accumulation rate (90% of the information was collected over the last 2 years) and the data processing speed; in recent times, real-time data processing technologies have become more in demand. <br>  <u><b>Variety</b></u> - diversity, i.e.  possibility of simultaneous processing of structured and unstructured multi-format information.  The main difference between structured information is that it can be classified.  An example of such information is customer transaction information. <br>  Unstructured information includes video, audio files, free text, information coming from social networks.  To date, 80% of the information is included in the unstructured group.  This information needs a comprehensive analysis to make it useful for further processing. <br>  <u><b>Veracity</b></u> - the accuracy of the data, the increasing importance of users began to attach importance to the reliability of the available data.  Thus, Internet companies have a problem in separating actions performed by a robot and a person on the company's website, which ultimately leads to difficulty in analyzing data. <br>  <u><b>Value</b></u> - the value of the accumulated information.  Big Data should be useful to the company and bring some value to it.  For example, to help in improving business processes, reporting or optimizing costs. <br><br>  If the above 5 conditions are met, the accumulated data volumes can be considered as large. <br><br>  <b>Applications for Big Data</b> <br><br>  The scope of using Big Data technology is vast.  So, with the help of Big Data, you can learn about customer preferences, about the effectiveness of marketing campaigns or conduct a risk analysis.  Below are the results of the IBM Institute survey on the use of Big Data in companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e59/2e0/4c2/e592e04c2ae0423390bf4d18f524889a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As can be seen from the diagram, most companies use Big Data in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãcustomer service, the second most popular area is operational efficiency, and in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãrisk management, Big Data is less common today. <br><br>  It should also be noted that Big Data is one of the fastest growing areas of information technology, according to statistics, the total amount of received and stored data doubles every 1.2 years. <br>  For the period from 2012 to 2014, the amount of data transmitted monthly by mobile networks increased by 81%.  According to Cisco estimates, in 2014 the volume of mobile traffic was 2.5 exabytes (a unit of information amount equal to 10 ^ 18 standard bytes) per month, and already in 2019 it will be equal to 24.3 exabytes. <br>  Thus, Big Data is already an established sphere of technology, even despite its relatively young age, which has become widespread in many areas of business and plays an important role in the development of companies. <br><br><h5>  <b>Big Data Technologies</b> </h5><br>  The technologies used for collecting and processing Big Data can be divided into 3 groups: <br><ul><li>  Software; </li><li>  Equipment; </li><li>  Service Services. </li></ul><br><br>  The most common data processing (software) approaches include: <br>  <u><b>SQL</b></u> is a structured query language that allows you to work with databases.  Using SQL, you can create and modify data, and the management of the data set is handled by the corresponding database management system. <br>  <u><b>NoSQL</b></u> - the term stands for Not Only SQL (not only SQL).  It includes a number of approaches aimed at implementing the database, which differ from the models used in traditional, relational database management systems.  They are convenient to use with a constantly changing data structure.  For example, to collect and store information in social networks. <br>  <u><b>MapReduce</b></u> is a computational distribution model.  Used for parallel computations over very large data sets (petabytes * and more).  In the program interface, not the data is transferred to the program for processing, but the program - to the data.  Thus, the request is a separate program.  The principle of operation consists in the sequential processing of data by two methods Map and Reduce.  Map selects preliminary data, Reduce aggregates them. <br>  <u><b>Hadoop</b></u> - is used to implement search and contextual mechanisms of high-load sites - Facebook, eBay, Amazon, etc. A distinctive feature is that the system is protected from the failure of any of the nodes of the cluster, since each block has at least one copy of data on another node. <br>  <u><b>SAP HANA</b></u> is a high-performance NewSQL data storage and processing platform.  Provides high speed query processing.  Another distinguishing feature is that SAP HANA simplifies the system landscape, reducing the cost of supporting analytical systems. <br><br>  Technological equipment includes: <br><ul><li>  servers; </li><li>  infrastructure equipment. </li></ul><br>  Servers include data warehouses. <br>  Infrastructure equipment includes platform acceleration facilities, uninterruptible power supplies, server console kits, etc. <br><br>  <i>Service Services.</i> <br>  Service services include the services of building a database system architecture, arranging and optimizing the infrastructure, and ensuring the safety of data storage. <br><br>  Software, hardware, and services together form an integrated platform for storing and analyzing data.  Companies such as Microsoft, HP, EMC offer services for the development, deployment of solutions for Big Data and their management. <br><br><h5>  <b>Application in industries</b> </h5><br>  Big Data is widespread in many business sectors.  They are used in health care, telecommunications, trade, logistics, financial companies, as well as in public administration. <br>  Below are a few examples of using Big Data in some of the industries. <br><br>  <i>Retail</i> <br>  In the databases of retail stores can be accumulated a lot of information about customers, inventory management system, the supply of commercial products.  This information can be useful in all areas of the stores. <br><br>  So, with the help of accumulated information, you can manage the supply of goods, its storage and sale.  Based on the accumulated information, it is possible to predict the demand and supply of goods.  Also, the data processing and analysis system can solve other problems of the retailer, for example, to optimize costs or prepare reports. <br><br>  <i>Financial services</i> <br>  Big Data provides an opportunity to analyze the borrower's creditworthiness, they are also useful for credit scoring * and underwriting **.  The introduction of technology Big Data will reduce the time for consideration of loan applications.  With the help of Big Data, you can analyze the operations of a particular customer and offer suitable banking services to him. <br><br>  <i>Telecom</i> <br>  In the telecommunications industry, Big Data was widely distributed in mobile operators. <br>  Mobile operators along with financial organizations have one of the most extensive databases, which allows them to carry out the most in-depth analysis of the accumulated information. <br>  The main purpose of data analysis is to retain existing customers and attract new ones.  For this, companies conduct customer segmentation, analyze their traffic, determine the social identity of the subscriber. <br><br>  In addition to using Big Data for marketing purposes, technologies are used to prevent fraudulent financial transactions. <br><br>  <i>Mining and petroleum industry</i> <br>  Big Data is used in both mining and processing and marketing.  On the basis of the information received, enterprises can draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the development of the field, track the overhaul schedule and the condition of the equipment, and forecast the demand for products and prices. <br><br>  According to the Tech Pro Research survey, Big Data was most prevalent in the telecommunications industry, as well as in engineering, IT, financial and state-owned enterprises.  According to the results of this survey, Big Data is less popular in education and healthcare.  The survey results are presented below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6c/c0f/e99/c6cc0fe993ee4e1ca5e0e9817a1b189d.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>Examples of using Big Data in companies</b> </h5><br>  Today, Big Data is being actively introduced in foreign companies.  Companies such as Nasdaq, Facebook, Google, IBM, VISA, Master Card, Bank of America, HSBC, AT &amp; T, Coca Cola, Starbucks and Netflix are already using Big Data resources. <br><br>  The applications of the processed information are diverse and vary depending on the industry and the tasks that need to be performed. <br>  Below are examples of the application of Big Data technology in practice. <br><br>  <u><b>HSBC</b></u> uses Big Data technology to counter plastic card fraud.  With the help of Big Data, the company has increased the effectiveness of the security service 3 times, the recognition of fraudulent incidents - 10 times.  The economic effect from the introduction of these technologies exceeded $ 10 million. <br><br>  Antifraud * <u><b>VISA</b></u> allows you to automatically calculate fraudulent transactions, the system currently helps to prevent fraudulent payments in the amount of $ 2 billion annually. <br><br>  <u><b>IBM's</b></u> Watson supercomputer analyzes real-time cash flow data.  According to IBM, Watson increased the number of detected fraudulent transactions by 15%, reduced false alarms of the system by 50%, and increased the amount of money protected from transactions of this nature by 60%. <br><br>  <u><b>Procter &amp; Gamble</b></u> uses Big Data to design new products and make up global marketing campaigns.  P &amp; G has created specialized offices in the Business Spheres where you can view information in real time. <br>  Thus, the management of the company had the opportunity to instantly test hypotheses and conduct experiments.  P &amp; G believes that Big Data helps in predicting company performance. <br><br>  OfficeMax office supplies retailer uses Big Data technology to analyze customer behavior.  Analysis of Big Data allowed to increase B2B revenue by 13%, reduce costs by $ 400,000 per year. <br><br>  According to <u><b>Caterpillar</b></u> , its distributors miss $ 9 billion to $ 18 billion each year just because they don‚Äôt adopt Big Data processing technologies.  Big Data would allow customers to more effectively manage their fleets, by analyzing information from sensors installed on machines. <br><br>  To date, it is already possible to analyze the condition of key assemblies, their degree of wear, and manage the costs of fuel and maintenance. <br><br>  <u><b>Luxottica group</b></u> is a manufacturer of sports glasses, such brands as Ray-Ban, Persol and Oakley.  The Big Data technology company uses to analyze the behavior of potential customers and "smart" SMS marketing.  As a result, the Big Data Luxottica group has identified more than 100 million of its most valuable customers and increased the effectiveness of the marketing campaign by 10%. <br><br>  Using Yandex Data Factory, <u><b>World of Tanks</b></u> game developers analyze player behavior.  Big Data technologies allowed analyzing the behavior of 100 thousand World of Tanks players using more than 100 parameters (information about purchases, games, experience, etc.).  As a result of the analysis, a forecast of users outflow was obtained.  This information allows you to reduce user care and work with participants in the game targeted.  The developed model turned out to be 20-30% more efficient than standard tools for analyzing the gaming industry. <br><br>  <u><b>The German Ministry of Labor</b></u> uses Big Data in its work related to the analysis of incoming applications for unemployment benefits.  So, after analyzing the information, it became clear that 20% of benefits were paid undeservedly.  With the help of Big Data, the Ministry of Labor has cut spending by 10 billion euros. <br><br>  <u><b>Toronto Children's Hospital has</b></u> implemented Project Artemis.  This is an information system that collects and analyzes data on infants in real time.  The system monitors every second 1260 indicators of the state of each child.  Project Artemis allows you to predict the unstable state of the child and begin the prevention of diseases in children. <br><br><h4>  <b>REVIEW OF THE WORLD MARKET OF BIG DATA</b> </h4><br><h5>  <b>Current state of the world market</b> </h5><br>  In 2014, Big Data, according to Data Collective, became one of the priority areas of investment in the field of venture capital industry.
