Some hosting providers offer not only modern Russian data centers, but also the most advanced <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/320218/">foreign sites</a> for hosting <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/307494/">VPS / VDS</a> virtual servers.  In some cases, customers resort to the services of <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/416133/">foreign data centers</a> .  <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/319716/">We have already written</a> about the pros and cons of choosing such data centers and what they may be of interest to Russian customers, so we will not dwell on this in detail. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/256/b3b/51d/256b3b51d01345014ffd4cfd5a580e7b.jpg"></div><br>  Today we will talk about the famous data center of the <a href="https://www.interxion.com/Locations/zurich/">Interxion</a> holding in Zurich, Switzerland.  Let's see what this site is good for and what it can offer customers, let's take a short tour of the data center.  But first - a little about who the company is Interxion, and what it is famous for. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Fifty Interxion data centers</font> </h2><br>  Interxion currently operates more than 50 data centers in 11 countries.  Despite the fact that the company describes itself as exclusively European, the majority of its customers are American companies that seek to create ‚Äúbridgeheads‚Äù in Europe. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e76/237/494/e76237494a148f0d28a18d321b01ccc1.png"></div><br>  Interixion offers flexible solutions in its 50 data centers in 13 European cities - a range of options to meet different needs for security, power supply and cooling.

      Interxion customers can choose the site as close as possible to their target audience and guarantee it a minimum delay in accessing their Internet resources. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cef/1af/a30/cef1afa30b0fd1e6be72d1a546a97be2.png"></div><br>  Interxion's Cloud Connect service provides secure and high-performance VLAN connections to several well-known clouds, such as Microsoft Azure, Oracle Cloud, and Amazon Web Services. <br><br>  The cloud access service Interxion Cloud Connect provides connection to several cloud providers.  With Cloud Connect, a client gets quick access to the cloud and can dynamically scale the bandwidth of a network connection. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c06/309/588/c063095880ee7481e43348d4190f300b.jpg"></div><br>  Interxion can offer the solution you need and the shortest path to the Google cloud in many parts of Europe. <br><br>  If a business requires a reliable and high-performance connection to the Google Cloud cloud platform, then the Interxion data center is the right place.  In this case, you can either establish a dedicated connection on your own, or use Cloud Connect service for simplicity <br><br>  Many Interxion data centers have passed the SSAE16 audit or are ISO or LEED certified.  In addition, its data centers have received industry-specific awards in a variety of categories, including operational reliability, market leadership, and green initiatives. <br><br>  The company continues to commission new sites.  This year, Interxion opened its third data center in London, codenamed "LON3".  It offers 1,800 square meters of space and 3 MW of power, provides customers with a choice of over 100 providers and eight main CDNs. <br><br>  By the way, this spring, the Russian hosting provider RUVDS completed negotiations with the British data center Equinix LD8, Huawei and the international backbone carrier RETN on the creation of <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/416133/">RUVDS containment zones in London.</a> RUVDS also opens a <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/412829/">new platform</a> based on MMTS-9 ( <a href="http://www.alldc.ru/dcs/cod/448.html">M9</a> ).  Currently, <a href="http://www.mmts9.ru/about/o-nas.php">MMTS-9</a> is the largest technological platform in Moscow for interaction between Moscow, Russian and international telecom operators in the provision of local, long-distance, international telephone communication, data transmission, Internet access and other telecommunication services.  In addition, MMTS-9 is the largest point of inter-operator exchange of Internet traffic in Russia. <br><br>  Due to its location in the center of the British capital, the Equinix data center is primarily focused on enterprises in the financial sector, in the advertising and media industry. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c74/6de/fef/c746defef771544fdcf117864ae3af04.jpg"></div><br>  Interxion is characterized by a consistently high utilization rate of its sites (at the level of 81%) and revenue growth.  In the first quarter of this year, the total area of ‚Äã‚Äãits data center, equipped with equipment, increased by 4 thousand m2. <br><br>  Interxion engineers are no strangers to innovation.  Over the years, the company has repeatedly become a pioneer in the field of modular data centers and advanced cooling solutions.  For example, several years ago, it decided to use sea water for cooling several of its data centers in Stockholm, which made it possible to achieve significant advantages in the field of energy efficiency: electricity costs were reduced by 80%.  With the help of water from the Baltic Sea, engineers were able to achieve PUE at level 1.1.  In addition to the introduction of seawater cooling technology, the company was a pioneer in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãphased development and transition to cold corridors. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Datacenter in Zurich</font> </h2><br>  Strategically located in the center of one of the largest financial markets in Europe, Equinix data processing centers in Zurich provide security, privacy, network reliability and low latency, including the ability to reach 80% of Europe with a network delay of 30 ms (round-trip delay).  In addition, it is possible to connect to more than 70 network service providers, more than 60 cloud and IT providers, and more than 10 content and digital media providers.  Zurich data centers are certified to meet strict environmental and energy standards. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be7/cbf/6ef/be7cbf6ef8b3ede414d11f629b03b7bc.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Zurich, located in the center of Europe, attracts companies from many countries.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Its business-friendly environment, tax regime and highly educated workforce contribute to the success and prosperity of financial and technological organizations from around the world.</font></i> <br><br>  Zurich data center Interxion ZH1 offers flexible conditions in accordance with the needs in the data center and electricity areas, since over time these needs may change. <br><br>  The ZH1 IBX is a purpose-built, highly reliable data center in the center of Zurich with conference rooms and office space.

Interixion also provides a wide range of power configurations and power distribution options. <br><br>  Customer equipment is supported in climate-controlled environments, with the appropriate temperature and humidity parameters specified in the SLA.  As you know, static electricity can be dangerous for IT equipment in the data center.  To minimize it, it is recommended to maintain a certain level of relative humidity in the data center premises.  The problem of condensate - another problem, therefore, exceeding the maximum value of the level of relative humidity in the data center is also undesirable and must be controlled.  The data center complies with the SLA in temperature and humidity in accordance with the recommendations of ASHRAE.  Cooling systems are reserved according to the N + 1 scheme. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/707/74e/22c/70774e22c871bda1262fd91c211a5c5c.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">All racks with server and telecom equipment are installed on the raised floor.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The main function of the raised floor is to supply cold air to the racks.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Under the raised floor there are busbars, through which electricity is supplied to the racks.</font></i> <br><br>  As emphasized in the company, customers can be confident in the physical security of their systems, infrastructure performance and its availability - it is guaranteed by the SLA at the level of 99.999%. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd3/711/79e/dd371179ec4cc087babd96135fce1939.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Data center security is monitored around the clock using CCTV and security services.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The data center uses multiple access systems, including contactless keys and biometric readers.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Customers can also add their own security systems - if they rent a separate room.</font></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ce/96d/f12/3ce96df129b742d2f0fd022bc9dd0ef8.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Interixion data centers have five levels of physical security, and security officers work 24/7.</font></i> <br><br>  All the premises and the territory of the data center are viewed through the internal and external surveillance cameras.

It uses modern systems and processes to monitor and manage operations 24x7, with local support services specialists working with a multilingual European Customer Service Center (ECSC). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad0/237/b37/ad0237b37ec4eb9cc02461f7f14df449.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Thanks to round-the-clock monitoring and incident and business continuity management systems, the company adheres to industry best practices and operates in accordance with ITILv3.</font></i> <br><br>  The data center is powered by two substations of different electricity suppliers.  All equipment has two power inputs, each of which is independently equipped with a UPS and a backup power supply from a diesel generator. <br><br>  Thus, two power supply beams are connected to all critical engineering equipment.  All IT equipment connects to two independent beams through uninterruptible power supplies.  If the city power is lost, the UPS automatically transfers its load to the batteries.  At the same time, the automation system gives the command to start the DGS.  They need about a minute to reach operating power, after which the data center begins to be powered by a diesel generator set, and not by batteries. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/160/c0c/2c1/160c0c2c12a354716b337f4131f99d9c.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">DGU can support the work of the data center for an unlimited time.</font></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eeb/d3b/9ca/eebd3b9ca64d6638f4e7e2a3c25c5e15.jpg"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The data center is equipped with an early smoke detection system and an Inergen gas extinguishing system in accordance with local regulations.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">It is designed for maximum safety and minimum damage.</font></i> <br><br>  The data center in Zurich uses renewable energy and is certified by myclimate as the only green data center in Switzerland.  It uses free cooling systems and closed cold corridors.  All these measures allowed to reduce cooling costs by 30%. <br><br>  With free-cooling, the power supply of the cooling system is much cheaper: when the air conditioning compressors are turned off, only fans and pumps consume electricity.  All components of the cold supply are reserved according to the scheme N + 1 or N2: any component can be turned off for repair or service without interruption in the operation of the entire system. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9e1/2af/074/9e12af07413d0b0c0260826ae015ee7c.png"></div><br>  And finally, important news: Russian hosting provider RUVDS is commissioning its own pressure zone at the Interxion data center in Zurich.  The company already has a similar experience thanks to the collaboration with the Deltalis data center in Attinghausen, Switzerland.  The new site is designed to provide customers with the services of renting virtual servers VPS / VDS.  The implementation of projects in Switzerland ensures a high level of data security - technological and legal - as well as the optimization of access speed for European customers due to its convenient geographical location.  <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub">VPS</a> services in Zurich will be available from November 11, 2018 to both Russian and foreign RUVDS customers at the same low prices. <br><br>  An important advantage of Russian hosting providers offering their services on the basis of a foreign platform is the presence of a Russian-speaking technical support service, which is not always offered by foreign providers.  In addition, Russian hosting providers are well aware of the problems and requirements of Russian customers, and this often helps to resolve issues that have arisen as soon as possible. <br><br>  RUVDS services are focused primarily on the corporate segment: government agencies, banks, stock market players.  RUVDS has its own TIER 3 data center in Korolev, Moscow Region, as well as pressure zones in Deltalis (Switzerland), London Equinix LD8 (United Kingdom), and MMTS-9 (Moscow, Russia) data centers.  All containment systems meet the reliability level not lower than TIER 3, and the high speed of work and flexible tariff plans make web hosting attractive for customers. <br><br> <a href="https://ruvds.com/ru-rub/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ba/550/d25/1ba550d25e8846ce8805de564da6aa63.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427607/</a></p>
