These are the famous Converse Chuck Taylor All Star, also known as "conversions" or simply as All Star.  Starting in the 1920s, famous basketball players and crowds of fans of this sport walked in this simple democratic shoe.  They have become an integral part of the image and almost an obligatory attribute of punks since the time of the Ramones group.  In the 90s, to get an opportunity to get to any grunge party, their branded asterisk on their side was just as important as the entrance ticket.  Why are there, according to some, these sneakers - the most fake shoe brand in the world. <br><br>  But in the 2000s, their sales seriously sagged - despite hundreds of different modifications and colors, they began to buy less.  Converse sneakers acquired the honorable, but not at all profitable commercial title of ‚ÄúOld School‚Äù.  After the company was acquired by the giant Nike in 2003, it was time to change something.  And the advertising agency <a href="http://www.bssp.com/">Butler, Shine, Stern and Partners has</a> found, as it turned out, a damn good solution for the most unpleasant task that can only be given to an advertiser - the Chuck Taylor icon brand began to sound completely new and won the hearts of the younger generation again. <br><br>  No artificial smiles and boasts from TV screens with the performance of even the most eminent stars of sports and show business would not have found a response among teenagers who spend several hours a day on the Internet and have almost impenetrable immunity to fake advertising.  The only thing that could interest them is the opinion of their peers, like free people playing streetball in the stone jungle arenas, riding skateboards in city parks and creating alternative art in garages and basements.

      Following this idea, Converse created a special resource for <a href="http://www.converse.com/index.asp%3Fmode%3Dmby%26amp%3Bbhcp%3D1">Converse ‚ÄúGallery‚Äù</a> , where she invited everyone to express their love for the symbol of originality and self-expression, All Star sneakers, by shooting and showing the world a short 24-second video clip.  It is absolutely not necessary that the sneakers flashed in the frame, it is not necessary to even talk about them at least a word.  The main thing is to show what kind of people they wear, what they do and what they think. <br><br>  In the first three weeks, the campaign gathered 750 clips, the best of which were shown on television and glorified their creators.  Then it developed as a tsunami, and by now in the gallery of videos you can already see thousands and thousands of video works. <br><br>  There are no data on the impact of this promotion on Chucks sales, but Nike‚Äôs total profit increased last year by 25% and company representatives do not hide the fact that the newly acquired Converse contributed a significant share to it. <br><br>  From here, according to folk legends, fashion originates in attracting consumers to brand advertising.  Later there have already been a lot of similar examples, and I will certainly tell you about some of them in future articles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4796/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4796/</a></p>
