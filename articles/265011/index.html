In this study, Gartner evaluated the IBM MobileFirst Platform. <br><br>  According to Gartner, ‚ÄúMobile Application Development Platform (MADP) allows an enterprise to design, develop, test, deploy, deliver, analyze and manage its portfolio of cross-platform mobile applications for a wide range of devices based on Android or iOS operating systems, and also ensure compliance with the requirements for different use cases of mobile applications, including scenarios for internal and external use. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As noted in the Gartner report: ‚ÄúLeaders must demonstrate a sustainable combination of completeness of the concept (Completeness of Vision) and the ability to implement it (Ability to Execute).  In the MADP market sector, this means that leaders are not only successful in cross-platform development, deployment and management within the full life cycle, but also have the right vision of a multi-channel enterprise mission, provide support for several architectures and standards, demonstrate a clear understanding of IT requirements use scalable channels and participate in partnership agreements.  Leaders must provide platforms that are easy to acquire, plan, deploy and upgrade, and which can be connected to a variety of internal corporate and cloud services, both own and third parties. ‚Äù

Clients can use the platform to create and deploy mobile applications or to integrate applications created using third-party tools.  The platform is optimized for development using traditional programming languages, HTML5 and hybrid development, as well as for any combination of these approaches. <br><br>  ‚ÄúToday, most companies have already accumulated a solid portfolio of unrealized projects for creating mobile applications.  The IBM MobileFirst Platform allows you to quickly deliver high-quality applications with a modular platform that fully meets business requirements for flexibility and agility, ‚Äùsaid Phil Bakele, vice president of IBM for enterprise-class mobile solutions.  ‚ÄúWe believe that the consistently high IBM MobileFirst score by Gartner experts reinforces IBM‚Äôs commitment to improving its mobile application development platform and providing an extensive suite of tools and cloud services directly to developers around the world so they can concentrate on building outstanding mobile applications.‚Äù <br><br>  Various enterprises - which are still only launching their own development or are already rapidly increasing the number of their corporate mobile applications - can take advantage of the rich functionality of the IBM MobileFirst Platform, including opportunities for: <br><br>  <b>Continuous development</b> - Support for the full life cycle of a continuous delivery of mobile applications and services, implemented in a single solution.
