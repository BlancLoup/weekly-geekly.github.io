Currently, there are about <a href="http://remamedia.org/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D78:news%26catid%3D47:smm-news%26Itemid%3D103">5,000,000 Russian users</a> on the Mark Zuckerberg social network.  Compared to <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5">35 million daily VKontakte audience</a> and <a href="http://socvopros.ru/blog/Odnoklassniki/1601.html">27,000,000 Odnoklassniki</a> is very small, however, if you decide to promote your brand or startup on Facebook, then this is the article for you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Some marketers place high hopes on Facebook, predicting him the status of the leading advertising platform on the Internet, others claim that this resource can <a href="http://cossa.ru/articles/152/2535/">change business strategies</a> in the near future. <br><br>  You should know that 84% of Russian Facebook users are <a href="http://cossa.ru/articles/234/2418/">in the age range from 18 to 44 years</a> .  These are mostly frequent travelers, people who have contacts abroad, media representatives, businessmen who collaborate with foreign companies, as well as various Internet personalities.  In a word, fertile ground for the development of your business already exists.  But how to interact with this social network? <br><br>  Groups and pages

      What is the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/groups/basics">group for</a> , and what is the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/pages">page</a> and what is the difference between them?  You most likely grinned and thought something like: ‚ÄúOf course I know!  I sit in VK and understand perfectly how everything is arranged, because on social networks everything is about the same. ‚Äù  I hasten to disappoint you: everything on Facebook is radically different.  For me it was a surprise. <br><br>  Groups: <br><br>  1. Can be created by anyone, they allow users (usually a <b>small amount</b> ) to communicate on topics of interest to them. <br><br>  2. They can be either open (visible to everyone) or closed (visible only to a limited number of participants). <br><br>  3. The number of group members is limited.  The exact figure is <a href="http://www.quora.com/Facebook-Groups/What-is-the-maximum-number-of-members-can-a-Facebook-Group-have">difficult to</a> call.  By the way, there is a maximum number of friends - 5,000 people. <br><br>  4. New people can be added to the group by other members, if they have <i>not set a limit</i> on adding without their knowledge.  Administrators can accept or reject group membership requests. <br><br>  5. Participants receive a notification by default after a new material is published in a group.  With open access, any group members can upload photos, edit documents and participate in chat rooms. <br><br>  Well, you notice the difference with the VC?  Not yet?  Then continue reading. <br><br>  Pages: <br><br>  1. Allow brands and organizations to communicate directly with their fans (anyone who puts a like on the page is considered a fan). <br><br>  2. After the user has placed like on the page, he sees all of her updates in the news feed. <br><br>  3. Information and posts on the page are visible to any users, regardless of whether they clicked it or not. <br><br>  4. The number of fans on the page is unlimited.  They really can be <b>very</b> much.  For example, <a href="http://www.facebook.com/facebook">the Facebook page itself is</a> liked by 66,941,226 people. <br><br>  5. You can add tabs and applications to the page, as well as import a like box to third-party resources. <br><br>  6. Most page administrators are interested in how effective the materials they publish.  In order to track user activity at any time, Facebook provided an opportunity to view generalized anonymous statistics: people talking about this, total like, weekly total reach and other parameters. <br><br>  7. Administrators can check all statistics, as well as write posts on behalf of the page. <br><br>  8. To access the full settings and statistics of the page it is necessary that at least 30 visitors put like on it. <br><br>  Where is it more effective to lead the life of the project? <br><br>  Well, now the difference is felt?  At first, I also realized everything with difficulty, but then I took up this issue more seriously.  Here is the conclusion I came to: for VC group - this is the most visited and popular part of the brand, but in Facebook brands brands don't have any at all!  There are only pages, and the performance indicator is the number of likes on it.  Immediately I apologize if I gave everyone the known information, but before I began to understand, I really didn‚Äôt know about it, so initially our priority was placed on the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/groups/121551791262034/">group</a> in which there are now more than 1,000 people. <br><br>  If we were to deal with Facebook‚Äôs wisdom earlier, and did not rely on our ‚Äúknowledge‚Äù in the field of social networks, we would not allow such an error: the group acts more like a ‚Äúforum‚Äù on which a certain circle of people can exchange information and communicate on topics of interest to them. <br><br>  Ways to promote <br><br>  It's one thing to create a page, and quite another to attract fans.  This is more complicated.  However, there are several scenarios. <br><br>  1. Links <br><br>  This option is quite simple, though for its effectiveness it is necessary to have a visited resource.  All that is required of you is to set a link to the Facebook page.  To further simplify the task, install the Like box on the site.  The downside is obvious: this is the way people who already know about you will come to your page.  However, there are pluses, but about them in the second paragraph. <br><br>  2. Viral promotion <br><br>  The scenario is this: a fan of the page sees new materials in his news feed and, perhaps, likes them.  So the news becomes visible not only to him, but also to his friends.  According to statistics, the new post on the page "plyusts" <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/party-hall/%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D1%258F-%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25B2-facebook-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2582%25D1%2583-%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583-%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2/141449332600446%3Fref%3Dnf">every 15-20 subscribers</a> .  Kevin Koller (Facebook employee N2) claims that the average Facebook user has <a href="http://www.facebook.com/note.php%3Fnote_id%3D289608327735749">130 friends</a> .  It inevitably follows from this that much more personalities will see the latest publication than just fans of the page, because everything that a single person does is also seen by his friends. <br><br>  3. Linking Facebook to Twitter <br><br>  Linking a page to Twitter is a good way to convert your followers to Facebook fans.  By doing this, you can automatically send information about changes and innovations on Twitter right from the page. <br><br>  4. More like! <br><br>  It is no secret that some visitors like something that others have already appreciated.  For ‚Äústuffing‚Äù more likes you can apply to the content freelance exchange.  There are quite a lot of them on the Internet, and the services of such freelancers are quite inexpensive.  For example, like will cost you <a href="http://www.facebooklikes.ru/">3-5 rubles</a> . <br><br>  By the way, there are <a href="http://plusany.ru/">free services</a> that work according to the principle ‚Äúyou - me, I - you‚Äù.  Profit from them, again, is small, but there is a chance that your friends will know about you. <br><br>  5. Remember me! <br><br>  Easy and very affordable way.  Work to link to the page (facebook.com/companyname) was short.  This will help users to easily remember the name.  This feature will be available to you only after 30 people put like on your page. <br><br>  6. Registration <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a47/1e8/4e7/a471e84e7a8eb32b80539fa0b9c58ff5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Page design is one of the main components of success.  The user must be interested in the first seconds of stay, otherwise he will simply leave it.  A good example of the correct page is the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/gameloft">Gameloft greeting</a> , which currently has 5,062,362 fans: this is not just a picture that calls to click on Like, but a full-fledged application catalog, along with links to Twitter and a blog. <br><br>  What's next? <br><br>  You also need to regularly maintain the activity of your page.  How to do it right?  Let's figure it out. <br><br>  1. Briefly, but clearly. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.fedorvirin.ru/2011/04/07/%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25B2-facebook-%25E2%2580%2594-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588/">Studies show</a> that posts with a length of 80 characters or less have a 27% greater user engagement.  You can get their attention picture, accompanied by a small amount of text. <br><br>  2. Write when people see. <br><br>  Approximately 60% of posts are published from 10 am to 4 pm, however, information that appears after hours (in the morning or late in the evening) has a 20% <a href="http://themarketingspot.com/2011/05/my-study-whats-the-best-time-to-post-on-facebook.html">greater</a> user <a href="http://themarketingspot.com/2011/05/my-study-whats-the-best-time-to-post-on-facebook.html">engagement</a> . <br><br>  3. Best day of the week <br><br>  Most large companies share with us their revelations only on working days, but at the weekend they are silent.  So, this strategy is not correct, because posts posted on Saturday and Sunday are the most effective and get the maximum number of feedback from fans. <br><br>  4. Have a smoke? <br><br>  Placing a question at the end of a post increases the response by 15%.  Only here it is better not to get involved and not to ask too philosophical questions.  For example, instead of ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù And ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù It is <a href="http://www.smm3.org/socmediator/%3Fp%3D17245">better to ask ‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù And ‚ÄúWhere?‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  5. What are we talking about? <br><br>  To attract the attention of fans, it is not enough just to write something that comes into your head, and even in large quantities.  It is important to understand that the principle ‚Äúmore is better‚Äù will not work.  People are interested in facts and information strictly on business in order to quickly get to know her.  No one will touch your thoughts about life. <br><br>  What to write about?  For example, about project news, announcements, special offers, publish links, photos or mixed posts.  <a href="http://www.jeffbullas.com/2011/11/01/10-best-practice-tips-for-facebook-page-content-publishing/">It has been established</a> that users respond more actively to a post with a photo or video.  The main thing to be brief and very clear. <br><br>  6. The engine of trade <br><br>  Why don't we use the official ways that Facebook offers?  At the moment, text ads and banners are the main advertising tools on this social network.  You can also approach <a href="http://www.facebook.com/notes/social-media-club-moscow/sekrety-uspesnoj-reklamy-na-facebook/183616148341800">users</a> in a different way.  Here are some parameters: keyword, country, language, education, gender, age, interests, marital status. <br><br>  In addition, you can choose <a href="http://webmarketing.by/faq/media/chto-takoe-cpm-ctr-i-cpc/">a pricing policy</a> : CPM (cost per 1000 impressions) or CPC (cost per click).  You can add an image (110x80) to the ad unit to improve its appeal.  This increases the likelihood that the user will notice your ad. <br><br>  By the way, analysts from <a href="http://webtrends.com/">Webtrends</a> found that they click on ads on Facebook about once every 2000 impressions.  This figure is two times lower than in display advertising.  Facebook differs from other resources in that advertising here will not bring instant purchases, but will bring your brand to the rank of more recognizable. <br><br>  What conclusions can be made on the basis of the information provided? <br><br>  Should pay more attention to the project page, because in the end, the promotion will pass through it.  A page designed according to all canons will help you increase brand awareness, as well as increase the involvement of fans, which is one of the key performance indicators. <br><br>  Additional links: <br>  <a href="http://lpgenerator.ru/blog/2011/11/08/pochemu-vam-nuzhna-fan-stranica-facebook-facebook-fan-page/">Why do you need a Facebook fan page (Facebook Fan Page)?</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/zfort/blog/141078/">Facebook Welcome Page and Other Custom Tabs Guide</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/107410/">New groups, old groups, Facebook pages</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/139742/">Analysis of Facebook accounts of popular mobile game developers</a> <br>  <a href="http://cossa.ru/articles/234/13291/">The theory of "likes" - why users put likes and want to receive them</a> <br>  <a href="http://lpgenerator.ru/blog/2011/11/11/20-sposobov-prodvizheniya-fan-stranicy-facebook-facebook-fan-page/">20 ways to promote your Facebook fan page (Facebook Fan Page)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144679/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144679/</a></p>
