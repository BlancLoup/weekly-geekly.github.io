The main thing is to stop it in time!  And for this, the threat must be immediately noticed, and, to someone who is outside - inside you can no longer help yourself ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The previous article, ‚ÄúThe <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ip-concierge/blog/279476/">Undiscovered Castle ...</a> ‚Äù was a kind of provocation, thanks for the huge number of responses!  It is immediately apparent from them that no one believes in unsurpassed in our country.  Only here is a strange moment: no one believes in the reliability of doors, locks, grilles, alarms and other protection techniques, but everyone puts it, everyone buys it.  Amazing divergence of thoughts with the case!  The last article was published in part with the intention to reveal these contradictions. <br><br>  In the ‚ÄúSpetszamok‚Äù collective image, we described a certain assembly functionality of electronics and mechanics for the door lock, which we consider to be the most advanced in the field of protection against an uninvited guest.  If there are no such devices available in this form, they can be combined by yourself - this is for those who nevertheless decided to use this ‚Äútechnology advisor‚Äù.  But we promised that the main thing we say at the end of the topic.  Now, when the majority of the audience - it was a spectacular act - expressed itself in terms of the fact that there are still no defenses, we somehow believe that many will start to contradict themselves.  And we hope to see it with humor too.

      Some decided that it was an advertisement, but they were mistaken, because there would be an advertisement now, moreover on the basis of the previous anti-advertising.  And thanks to everyone who helped pro-advertise it! <br><br>  First, let us pay tribute to our reader, just as they were trying to prove the vulnerability of everything and everyone!  Alas, modern forensic science does not know the cases of opening combination locks with a thermal imager.  Although it contains millions of volumes on cracking the usual master key, so it makes sense to think about common sense, sorry for the tautology.  In addition, the Internet "pugalki" often reach even more absurdity than the statements about the unspeakability.  There are proving videos, pictures, articles ... For example, a photo laid out by someone, allegedly made by a thermal imager, is a vivid example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/638/5bd/9e7/6385bd9e761040319783c2c752ad807f.png"><br><br>  Today, the Russian ruby ‚Äã‚Äãindustry probably surpasses the American one already - due to defense orders, therefore there are a large number of thermal imaging specialists in companies like ours.  And we can confidently assert that the heat of the fingers on the keys lasts only a few seconds, and even then not on all materials.  The resolution of the photo turned out to be as much as 800x800, which only the imager can pull for half a million dollars.  Most of them are relatively cheap - their prices only exceed hundreds of thousands of rubles - they provide only 320x240.  And the superimposed camera of the visible spectrum is supposedly VGA, which is not exactly 800 either. Well, we don‚Äôt want to blame anyone, but the word ‚Äúphotomontage‚Äù suggests itself. <br><br>  Nevertheless, we are glad that the people understand that there are high-tech ways in the world for opening EVERYTHING.  But all the same it is not necessary, probably, to go to extremes.  Criminal statistics of penetration into houses and apartments shows that attackers use fairly simple options - even if there are very difficult locks and other equipment.  Criminals, like water or lightning, follow the path of least resistance. <br><br>  And in discussions, too, it sounded this course, which we consider to be the greatest vulnerability in any defense of a private territory.  That's right, if you leave some marks on the kodo-dial pad or even chemical for a long time.  solutions, in the end you can find out the cherished numbers of the opening of the castle.  But not like in the movies - the first time.  The human hand - the mechanism is not accurate, often slides on all buttons in a row, looking for the right one.  Yes, and their sequence can be understood only after long-term experiments selective processing of buttons, and direct selection can cause anxiety from the third approach.  Therefore, such a preparatory process is quite long, although there is a place to be.  Indeed, the police are registering such cases more and more often.  But usually this is the work of neighbors who are obsessed with searching for treasure, even if in other people's apartments. <br><br>  The main share of all crimes is the bias on the vulnerability of family members.  Almost all of us have children, elderly parents and even our own not always healthy head.  A poorly seeing grandmother will open the front door for a long time, displaying both the keys and the codes in plain view.  And if tomorrow she loses the key, then she will not notice.  The fed relative also will ask the stranger to help to open.  And the children will offer someone a game in the "golden key", so that they give away the home key and have been looking for it in the neighboring yard for a long time, saying the discovery code in a cherished place. <br><br>  Even with a powerful security alarm, you will not activate it to open the door for a cat for 10 seconds.  But this time is enough to enter "on the shoulders."  <b>What high technology, what thermal imagers?</b>  <b>Everything is much easier in the criminal world!</b> <br><br>  No technique will react!  Bandyuk not much into the scheme, they have one simple rule: come in as the owner entered.  And for this there are all possibilities, because we and our household are not able to hide from others 24 hours a day.  Yes, sometimes we just want to drink and, coming on the horns, we clearly demonstrate to outsiders all the charms of their "super protection" - voluntarily or unwittingly. <br><br>  Today, super-alert alarms really open up in minutes, and thanks again to everyone who took part in the gnobenie of the previous article - now it will not be easy for you to renounce it.  But many speakers are divorced from life, this technique is not opened by super-smart people and not by super-wise code-selectors, but by simple PSCs who work or work where you put this alarm.  ‚ÄúWhat we guard is what we have.‚Äù <br><br>  Once again and again we repeat: in 99.99% of cases, <b>crime does not use high technologies, but the simplest things!</b>  <b>Criminals, like water or lightning, follow the path of least resistance.</b> <br><br>  And in connection with this, this is the problem that drew up! .. Today's technologies can calculate the most complex scans, code selections, deceptive maneuvers in passing sensors, even the wrong approach to the safe, but no computer can tell one simple thing from another.  The forgotten code of a grandmother from a fraudster, a drunken host at the door of a burglar, a game of children from an attack by a gang, a childhood friend who enters with the host from a robber who attacked the host ... <br><br>  Alas, only a person is able to realize this.  Only an outsider, who is in his right mind and sober, in most cases can recognize a crime.  Moreover, the word "third-party" is the key one, because inside an apartment it is sometimes difficult to change something.  In order to adequately protect against any type of criminal intrusion into the house, an inexpensive video box for the front door ‚ÄúVideo lock‚Äù is intended. <br><br>  Naturally, it is vulnerable, like any technology.  But it is time to descend from heaven to the criminal land, where the main way of crime remains a completely simple ‚Äúthing‚Äù.  To prevent it, absolutely banal methods are also required, the main of which is control, simple human control. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/0db/d7b/ac10dbd7ba0043eb81e5b6571f3448e0.jpg"><br><br>  We offer a system of convenient control over the opening of the entrance door, including the cases of approach to it.  This is a video camera with an event storage cloud on <a href="http://ip-concierge.com/">the IP-Concierge video service</a> .  Having installed the application on your mobile phone, you will always be able to see how you and your loved ones go home, who is present, and what is suspicious in the process.  It takes only a few seconds, so even a weekly archive can be easily viewed in a few minutes - and you will always be aware of everything.  And be warned if someone pours powder on their code set.  And you don‚Äôt have to butt with the PSC for a false call, if the neighbors' children periodically play around with the code set. <br><br>  This is an opportunity to notice in advance the preparation of crime, it is an opportunity to find vulnerabilities in your family and teach it the rules of security, it is an opportunity to react immediately if someone else‚Äôs came in (if there are alarming parameters) and much more. <br><br>  Let us say right away how it differs from a standard alarm: no sensor can distinguish a decent person from a rogue, no sensor will detect if the owner has entered voluntarily or with a gag in his mouth, no sensor will work if he is not armed. <br><br>  We will not deceive also, a cheap video system, as in this case, will not even be able to recognize anything, but the Video Lock functionality does not provide for this.  Who is waiting for this price to see a description of cool video analytics, should not hope!  Nevertheless, the logic of the video lock makes it very convenient and efficient to use human intelligence, throwing off short videotapes of events generated when you open the door or approach it.  The word ‚Äúintellect‚Äù sounds loud here, it is only necessary for a person to understand whether his or someone else comes into the house, and in what state. This is feasible even for an old grandmother, although not accessible to a powerful computer. <br><br>  Depending on the importance of the notification, the phone may burst out with loud sounds, vibration, or be limited to lighting the screen and showing the widget.  Only 3 types of events.  Of course, if you have a lock with an alarm button or a device for the ‚Äúchain‚Äù algorithm, then you will often not have to worry - the phone will receive only emergency calls.  If there are no such traps, then everything.  But do not worry, how many times a day do your family members open the front door?  On average, this number rarely exceeds ten ‚Äî not such a stressful task.  Considering that you will still have useful information: when the son came from school, with whom the daughter returned from the cinema, what time did the plumber come, what did the social workers bring out of the house ... <br><br>  Video information is already recorded and downloaded - you do not have to connect for a long time and wait for the desired file.  In addition to operational information, an archive based on short data is stored in the cloud.  According to it, it is possible to raise the information in a year, who brought a strange box of shoes or how many times a plumber came in total.  It is very convenient for both forgetful people and analysts who can analyze the current situation on the basis of previous long-term events. <br><br>  Yes, probably, someone already has this, we offer such a system from ourselves, because we have something more. <br><br>  Not everyone wants to analyze something and generally control something.  For such gentlemen, a unique <a href="http://ip-concierge.com/">Internet service IP Concierge has been created</a> .  For only 1000 rubles per month, a live person will watch a few seconds on the air - minutes of the video included in the door opening sensor.  Ready to view 24 hours a day, day and night!  And he has no addresses, no telephones, he is not even in the nearest town.  Can it be traced or bribed by arriving in Khabarovsk or Altai?  Relax, crime is not looking for difficult ways that also protects all information, even shift duty. <br><br>  In addition, as we promised, the service includes a remote button on the phone to securely open the door remotely.  First, you see standing in front of the door.  Secondly, you see the latest events in front of the door - whether there was any criminal training.  Thirdly, by pressing it in the mobile application, our service sends you an SMS to make sure that you are the master, and only when such a message arrives on your SIM card, the opening is activated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/197/553/309/1975533091e44dacad59b7e237bde747.jpg"><br><br>  If there are alarming technologies like those described earlier in ‚ÄúSpetszamka‚Äù, the amount is reduced to 200 rubles per month, because the scope of work decreases sharply.  It doesn't matter whose firm.  Naturally, the video set-up Video lock together with the hidden electro-mechanics provide the highest level of protection for both the premises and the lives of the owners.  If you know another so tall, let us know - maybe we will buy from you? <br><br>  We repeat again and again that there are no unexplored defenses, but we offer real intelligence for protection. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396791/</a></p>
