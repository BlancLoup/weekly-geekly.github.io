And PHP. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Course for schoolchildren: HTML, CSS, JS </h4><br>  <b>Who:</b> Moscow Coding School and "Prodlenka" <br>  <b>Pay</b> (19 999 rub.), <b>There is a grant</b> <br>  <b>Pros: the</b> first own project for a teenager 12-16 years <br><br>  The course is held in Moscow on weekends - starting from March 7, and it will last 4 weekends.  Sergey Nugaev, who did special projects for Google, and his two assistants for a series of four-hour classes will show the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, code execution principles, tell you something about the architecture and a little bit about mathematics.  Following the results, each child will create his first project. <br><br>  Yulich <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/lesnikova/" class="user_link">lesnikova,</a> after her ‚ÄúProdlenka about programmers‚Äù, went and knocked out a grant for training one boy or a girl of 12-16 years old: she‚Äôs generally assertive.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/prodlenka.pro/posts/1568683640081995">The contest</a> is about to end, but you can try - and in the case of ‚Äúdid not have time / failed‚Äù, pick up the promotional code for 10% on the <a href="http://moscoding.ru/course/webkids/">course</a> itself. <br><br><h4>  Field camp of application programming and robotics in the Moscow region </h4><br>  <b>Who:</b> GoTo Camp <br>  <b>Pay</b> (22 000 rub.), <b>There is a grant</b> <br>  <b>Pros: the</b> first own project for 8-11-graders with teachers who work in Yandex, ABBYY, KROK, Moscow State University, MIPT, HSE and UrFU <br><br>  Each participant will have the opportunity to implement the project in one of two areas.  Or it is application development: server, mobile, with graphical and web-interfaces.  Or in the field of robotics on the Arduino platform.  From idea to working prototype. <br><br>  <a href="http://goto.msk.ru/">Applications</a> are accepted until March 10.  The same Yulich, through his ‚ÄúProdlenka‚Äù, produced a free place there: <a href="http://prodlenka.pro/meeting/gotocamp/">you can win it</a> - and those who do not win can spy on a promotional code for a discount. <br><br><h4>  Parallels Labs Labs, Summer and Winter Schools for Students </h4><br>  <b>Who:</b> Parallels and MIPT, MSU, NSU and SPbAU RAS <br>  <b>Free,</b> possible scholarship following a good project <br>  <b>Pros:</b> work on real projects in groups of 3-5 people, even from the first course.  Sometimes they accept students from other universities. <br><br>  They do not give lectures here, but teach the team to work on a project, simulating approaches to developing complex software products.  As in real IT companies.  The range of topics for development is wide: cloud systems, multi-threaded programming, virtualization, information protection and data storage. <br><br>  The main admission criteria: the presence of at least some programming experience.  Plus the absence of threes.  Therefore, for the duration of the sessions, they give out sessions.  To get to the laboratories from other call, you must separately contact <a href="http://sp.parallels.com/ru/education/contacts/">representatives of the program</a> . <br><br><h4>  Mitap for adult game developers </h4><br>  <b>Who: a</b> group of devsgo enthusiasts <br>  <b>Is free</b> <br>  <b>Pros:</b> independence from industry companies and no criteria for checking at the entrance (except to confirm that you are 21 years old or more, because meeting at the bar). <br><br>  The guys are doing their first metap, but they want to turn it into a series ‚ÄúDevsGo to DevNight‚Äù.  Their leader, Cyril, makes games for several years and even won several hackathons.  On the spot - in the bar at Novokuznetsk, interesting news, reports and projects are promised.  <a href="https://devsgo.timepad.ru/event/188689/">Registration</a> is until March 17 inclusive. <br><br><h4>  Online: a library of interactive courses on C ++, Python, Linux and testing Swift, Ruby, Scala and PHP </h4><br>  Our good friend Anya always loved Coursera (if she went to the Knowledge Stream, she helped her do it), so today she settled into the distributed command <b>Stepic</b> - this is a non-commercial project that helps university teachers to write an open interactive library of review courses in mathematics, programming and other topics.  The project works on a custerian model: there are dates for starting courses, blocks, tasks.  From the past, <a href="https://stepic.org/courses">basic courses</a> about Python, C ++ and Linux are available. <br><br>  And if you want a purely test of skills and knowledge, you can try <a href="http://willdev.ru/"><b>WillDev</b></a> - a project from Russian guys, containing puzzles on Scala, Ruby, Swift, PHP, Java, C ++, C # and several others with increasing complexity. <br><br><h4>  Some famous paid stories we missed in the last issue </h4><br>  The site of the center <a href="http://www.specialist.ru/">‚ÄúSpecialist‚Äù</a> at MSTU named after Bauman is so complex that it‚Äôs impossible to understand when and what will pass.  They learn a lot here that can relate to the web (PHP, XML, JavaScript, ASP.NET, Ruby) and mobile development, DBMS and testing, and often build courses for different levels of training: there is a lot of things for beginners in the subject. <br><br>  Their plus is the mass of points of study in Moscow, and at each point the desired course can start on different dates, which is convenient.  Well, there are good teachers: we found the leading Android programming course here.  Here they conduct courses for high school students: C, C #, Java, HTML and CSS, Pascal. <br><br>  <a href="http://proglive.ru/">"School of programming" was</a> founded by graduates of Baumanka.  In general, a more convenient site and buns in the form of free introductory lessons.  Pretty quickly (but always intuitively) you can understand that in March, for example, there will be courses in Ruby, Objective C, PHP, Swift and JavaScript. <br><br>  In the <a href="http://liderkurs.ru/">"Leader"</a> there are courses "PHP + HTML + CSS", C and Java for Muscovites and Petersburgers.  Starting as groups are established, therefore, plus in the choice of dates and times (morning, afternoon, evening) of classes that the new groups decide among themselves and with the teacher. <br><br><h4>  Who wants to run programming schools </h4><br>  After the first digest, we wrote to the guys from ICI, what they think in this direction.  Then the residents came from Artofad - they are there almost all coders, almost all recent graduates complain that they don‚Äôt teach systems approach to solving design problems.  We also occasionally think aside - because, ideally, steep practitioners also need strong organizers. <br><br>  So, your opinions, what is missing now and what is really important to master, will not be superfluous and important. <br><br><h4>  What we missed </h4><br>  In St. Petersburg, for example, a wave of applications for a free school of iOS e-Legion iOS development has just passed - they were accepted until March 2. <br><br>  <b>Therefore:</b> we will be grateful to the community if in the comments it shares events that are worth paying attention to in the near future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/252317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/252317/</a></p>
