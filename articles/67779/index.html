      This article is a continuation of a <s>recently</s> launched series of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/smartphone_ru/64088/">articles</a> about the second CDMA communicator of the IMT-MC 450 standard in the Russian market - AnyData asp-505.  By the way, I didn‚Äôt accidentally add the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù to the name of the appliance: asp-505A, because there is another version of it: asp-505C and it has a telephone module CDMA-800, in contrast to 505A, in which CDMA-450, Details about the difference between these standards can be found in the comments to the previous film (part). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Chapter One: Complete software. </h4><br><br><h4>  Part One: software package from AnyData. </h4><br><br>  In this part, we will focus on the software with which the communicator resides from the factory in Skylink, no more, no less. <br><br>  On the device is installed Windows Mobile 6.1 professional.  Not the best choice for the user, frankly.  This, of course, a special IMHO.  For the programmer - an excellent system: high availability of tools for creating software;  a large audience at the expense of older, better versions of WM (for example, wm2003 versus wm6.1 is similar to XP versus Vista).  Many members of our herd (as, indeed, I once) come to the state of wm out of habit for the word Windows, marveling later on the lack of anything in common between the computer version and the mobile (it seems only the famous cross that closes (collapses?) application - common). <br><br>  But if it‚Äôs garlic, there are no alternatives to the operating system, all Linuxes, including maemo, Android, moblin, OpenMoko and others, are still not completely unpleasant from the unpleasant dev / beta flavor, and with CDMA drivers in them hard  As for MacOS (IPhone ARM port) or Symbian, then there are problems with the copyright holders (Apple does not distribute and does not allow installing the OS on any hardware, except for its own production). <br><br>  Actually, I will describe the Windows with the following short paragraph, the quintessence of positive and negative, but it has been known to everyone for a long time: so wm6.1 pro is a bright representative of the window family, moderately buggy, but almost free from RuntimeError (critical error) caused by its own, small, soft software  However, the huge number of applications that are on the market and the lack of requirements for them (such as those presented to the software in the Apple AppStore or Google Android Market / Nokia Ovi / Palm App Catalog / Blackberry App world, etc.) creates a situation where which any uncle Vanya from the gateway on his netbook can write a curve for the program and hang the device all the time.  Winda is like a tank: what is not treated with a reset is treated by taking out the battery, then that which is not treated by taking out the battery is treated with a hard reset.  What is not treated with a hard reset is not treated in principle. <br><br>  From the software that the vendor itself added to the communicator (Koreans / Chinese? / From AnyData), the icon 'AnyData Settings' icon was found on the 'System' tab in the 'Settings' menu: <br><br><img src="http://goshil.narod.ru/habr_imgs/asp505/anydata-set.bmp" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside there are several tabs: <br><br><img src="http://goshil.narod.ru/habr_imgs/asp505/anydata-set-ins.bmp" alt="image"><br><br>  The main setting is the device mode when connected to a desktop computer: <br><br>  - Window Mobile device (synchronization mode with Microsoft ActiveSync and analogs), <br><br>  - modem, in this mode through it you can establish an internet connection. <br><br>  The remaining tabs are responsible for turning on / off charging from USB, for automatically adjusting the microphone to the volume of the input signal and which key the device will wake up from sleep mode: by pressing the 'power' button or by pressing any key.  This is probably all the software besides windows mobile, with which AnyData completes its communicator, and I suppose that some of the settings are default for all windows mobile, in this case they are simply assembled in one bundle under the proud logo of AnyData (I see that This icon has already popped up somewhere else before it was invented in AnyData :-)) <br><br>  Also from the software that I did not see on windows mobile 2003 (when I used it on the wonderful HP iPAQ rx3715 / <i>which, however, just as wonderful, I threw it with my performance - well, I‚Äôm not lucky with AshPi</i> /) I was interested in 'Shared Internet' application.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application is simply wonderful: it rassharivaet Internet from the device and access to the file system as a USB-Network / Remark: <i>in fact, when you connect to the desktop computer in synchronization mode between the communicator and this computer, the so-called USB network is configured, that is, in the desktop the system has a virtual network card to which the communicator is connected, and in fact your little animals are connected with a simple USB-cord instead of a network wire;</i>  <i>programmatically - everything is as it should be: IP addresses are allocated, synchronization takes place via a separate protocol, via a separate port.</i>  <i>This is not accidental, so the device and the computer will be completely no matter what the data transfer environment is USB, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth-Networking (PAN) or directly via a network cable, if provided by the device manufacturer (for one of the first PDA, Cassio, it seems to me, some kind of three hundredth Cassiopeia, was an adapter: on the one hand, the connector to the device, on the other, natural RJ-45, but now this is, of course, exotic =))</i> /, and via Bluetooth Networking, that is, when a bluetooth connection pretends to be networked, something like Wi-Fi, with only minimal  m encryption and range. <br><br><h2>  Part Two: SkyLink software bundle. </h2><br><br>  Now let's move on to one of the innovations applied in both Skaylink communicators (in the ASP-500 to a lesser extent): to be equipped with software from the operator.  SkyLink bundles ASP-505 with several programs (the programs are already pre-installed on the new communicator, and their distributions are on the memory card in the SkyLink folder): <br><br><h5>  SpbMobileShell (aka SkyTouch) </h5><br><br>  Launcher (a beautiful shell for running programs from Spb, SkyLink was originally called SkyTouch in the package), featuring a very nice interface.  Some kind of IPhone + HTC Touch interfaces.  Similarity, I must say, not of the highest class, so, middling, on a solid four.  Perhaps, just under Windows Mobile nothing is possibly better (which, by the way, I doubt a little).  Nevertheless, the firm Spb has been engaged in software for WM for a long time, and has worked well in this market. <br><br>  SkyTouch itself is installed in the right corner of the Today screen (Windows Mobile desktop), so it starts with a single click.  Inside, everything is quite simple: there are several screens: <br>  The first one is the main one, in it there are outputs to all other screens: <br><br><img src="http://goshil.narod.ru/habr_imgs/asp505/st-main.bmp" alt="image"><br><br>  On the left (according to the hierarchy of the lower menu of the main screen) is the next screen containing information about the time, date, day of the week, current calendar view, weather, notification mode, the number of missed calls / messages / e-mails. <br><br><img src="http://goshil.narod.ru/habr_imgs/asp505/st-left.bmp" alt="image"><br><br>  To the right of the main screen is the quick access screen for your favorite contacts.  In other words, a set of fifteen selected contacts in one touch.  This is undoubtedly very nice, but for me, for example, the main contacts usually feel good in the newly recruited ones, however, this is &lt; <i>gross, uncouth</i> &gt; IMHO. <br><br><img src="http://goshil.narod.ru/habr_imgs/asp505/st-right.bmp" alt="image"><br><br>  SkyTouch comes with several tightly integrated components: SpbOnline and SpbSkyLink.  More information about them can be read directly on the <a href="http://www.skylink.ru/pages/article.aspx%3Fid%3D25538%26r%3D77">site</a> Skylink.  You can put them separately from SkyTouch, but it‚Äôs unlikely to use them normally later.  These fellows pull up SpbMobileShell cakes such as online TV, online Radio, Rss reader, links to all sorts of www SkyLink, Vkontakte, etc.  Everything is done in the same ‚Äúa la IPhone‚Äù design, scrolling with your finger, turning the pages with one touch, and so on.  Online services work quite normally, in Moscow you can watch and listen and read, all this even without lags.  But I don‚Äôt really need it, with my 100 megabytes of traffic per month and with a completely different area of ‚Äã‚Äãscientific interest, therefore, after playing for a month, I took the whole baidu (by the way, the most popular Chinese search engine is <b>baidu.cn</b> , <i>Wikipedia material</i> ) so that the memory is not occupied. <br><br>  SkyTouch Verdict - as already mentioned, the solid four.  The application includes SkyLink services and it was done quite well.  However, for example, when you click on an icon, graphically, under your finger, the entire frame, surrounding it, is burned in. If we talk about the IPhone, everything is arranged there, as it should be: the program icon itself is burned.  Well, here are a bunch-a bunch of such trifles.  And as we know, it‚Äôs just the little things that annoy and bore the average man in the street. <br><br><h5>  CityGuide (aka SkyProbki) </h5><br><br>  Independent Navigator, delivered under a partnership agreement with Skye on new communicators (review of the program supplied with the ASP-500 <a href="http://www.mforum.ru/phones/tests/063591.htm">here</a> , it says about the previous version of CityGuide, the second one that is relevant at that time).  Since this software is not exclusive and you can easily find its reviews on the Internet (for example, <a href="http://www.auto-gps.ru/articles/news_1233669245.shtml">here</a> ), I will say a few words about the direct interaction of CitiGuide with ASP-505: <br><br>  First you are asked to register on the program website - ( <a href="http://probki.net/">probki.net</a> ).  Now your navigator can download traffic information from this site (by the way, it would be time for them to conclude a partnership agreement (such as Avtosputnik, for example) with Yandex. Traffic jams, there, objectively, the service is much more powerful, but you have to use two programs: Guide for navigation, Yandex. Traffic jams - to monitor the situation on the road).  Also, now you can download free updates of the program itself and the main maps.  By use: it works quite quickly, the program itself is made with high quality.  GPS is caught for a long time, it is better to run the program after the satellites are caught by some other software (such as Yandex.Maps).  Traffic jams load quickly (3G from SkyLink, Preve!), Sometimes the navigator cannot find a route.  It is difficult to say what it is connected with.  Updated frequently and promptly.  I did not find how to rotate the screen in the program itself.  It may be necessary to rotate the screen in Windows and then run the Guide, but this is not kosher.  In short, I got used to it, glad, pleased. <br><br><h4>  Instead of a conclusion.  Although, why "instead"?  So, the Conclusion: </h4><br><br>  <i>Behind this, I‚Äôm leaving to continue my story later.</i>  <i>We are waiting for unprecedented adventures, new discoveries and a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãemotions, I will tell you about what third-party software I have installed to optimize the work, how to connect / synchronize our little animal with a large and not very computer (for whatever OS) and a huge number of comments revealed during the operation by me (and not only) of this Korean Miracle.</i>  <i>Wait for bright impressions!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67779/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67779/</a></p>
