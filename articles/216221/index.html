      According to legendary retailer Tom Hopkins ( <a href="http://www.tomhopkins.com/index.shtml%3FScreen%3Dindex">Tom Hopkins</a> ), who co-authored with experienced sales specialist <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ben-katt/e/b00fm9355q/ref%3Dntt_athr_dp_pel_2">Ben Katt</a> recently wrote the book “ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/When-Buyers-Say-Essential-Strategies/dp/1478926988/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dbooks%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1390844321">When Buyers Say</a> No”, “no” can open up many opportunities for you.  Here is what he told me: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  “No” means “yes” is possible </h4><br>  Most people will say no to a new idea first.  In fact, recent studies show that the average buyer doesn’t say no about 5 times before saying yes.  This is due to the fact that the selection process is emotional, not intellectual. <br><br>  Most people are focused primarily on the avoidance of negativity, and not on achieving positive results, so if we ask a person to make a decision, first of all he will start looking for reasons not to accept it.  As a rule, the answer takes the form of "no", although in fact it means "maybe." <br><br><h4>  There are three related types of “no” </h4><br>  Suppose you ask a “right” person (that is, someone who should say “yes”) - in such cases the answer “no” usually means: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Invalid information</b> .  You have not explained well enough why “yes” is the right decision.  By this, you should be able to better convey your thoughts to the interlocutor. </li><li>  <b>Wrong timing</b> .  A person needs time to think about a decision, so he often says “no” to get a pause and think it over.  Therefore, you must be patient and ask again later. </li><li>  <b>Unsuccessful circumstances</b> .  There is something above, something that a person does not control and what prevents him from saying “yes”.  Therefore, you must communicate more with him in order to rid him of the barrier. </li></ul><br><h4>  Be curious, not persistent. </h4><br>  The old saying “never take no for an answer” is often mistakenly understood as “keep annoying the buyer until he says yes.”  It will not help;  in fact, it will only increase “no.”  For example: <br><br>  [ <i>VC - Venture Entrepreneur - approx.</i>  <i>transl</i> .] <br><br>  You: “Can you provide initial funding of $ 2 million?” <br>  VC: “No.” <br>  You: “Are you sure?  This is not a very large amount. ” <br>  VC: “Yes, I'm sure (i.e.,“ no ”) <br>  You: “Okay, maybe $ 1 million? <br>  VC: “Have a nice day.” <br><br>  For comparison, if you are curious enough to ask why you received the answer “no”, you can continue the conversation and understand what needs to be done to get the answer “yes”, like this: <br><br>  You: “Can you provide initial funding of $ 2 million?” <br>  VC: “No.” <br>  You: “However, if I understand you correctly, you want to invest in a project of this type.  What exactly is wrong with my plans? ” <br><br><h4>  Develop dialogue </h4><br>  Depending on what you learned (as a result of the curiosity shown in the previous paragraph), conduct a dialogue so that it gradually opens up the possibility of a positive answer.  For example, in the dialog above, you could get one of three types of answers to your question: <br><br>  <b>Invalid information</b> .  In this case, you roll back in the conversation and clarify all neponyatki. <br><br>  VC: “I don't understand how you are going to monetize the project.” <br>  You: “I apologize for not explaining this well enough.  Let's go through this part again, and I will try to tell you more. ” <br><br>  <b>Wrong timing</b> .  In this case, you need to focus the conversation on how to arrange a new meeting to discuss this issue. <br><br>  VC: “I have to think about it for a while.” <br>  You: “I understand.  What areas of uncertainty do we need to clarify before we meet again? ” <br><br>  <b>Unsuccessful circumstances</b> .  In this case, you must be creative in order to overcome the barrier. <br><br>  VC: “We have already invested in competitors.” <br>  You: “Maybe we should think about a merger.  What can you tell me about them? ” <br><br>  It makes no sense to say that there are much more ways to turn “no” into “yes” (if you are interested in it, you can buy Tom’s book when it comes out), but the examples above show the main points that you will encounter in many businesses. - situations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216221/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216221/</a></p>
