      The first acquaintance: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/cisconetworks/52778/">in my first post</a> <br><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br><br>  In this article I will try to tell how and what is preparing for this initial certificate.  Which Cisco is positioning as giving in at school / college =) <br><br><h4>  CCNA- what kind of tsna? </h4><br><br>  I will quote Cisco site: <br><br> <code>The CCNA certification validates the ability to install, configure, operate, and troubleshoot medium-size routed and switched networks. CCNA certified professionals have the knowledge and skills to make connections to remote sites via a WAN, mitigate basic security threats, and understand the requirements for wireless network access. CCNA training covers (but is not limited to) the use of these protocols: IP, Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), Serial Line Interface Protocol Frame Relay, Routing Information Protocol Version 2 (RIPv2), VLANs, Ethernet, and access control lists (ACLs).</code> <br> <br>  What can be said in essence: <br>  Having this certificate, you confirm that you can configure a switch or router, understand how networks work, understand some routing protocols: RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, know how to configure VLAN, work with connections of various kinds, you can configure access control lists, DHCP, NAT and some more things. <br>  In some organizations you will not be hired without this certificate (they will not let you work on a cool project or will not be promoted). <br><br>  To pass the exam, you must choose two ways: <br><br>  Pass 1 exam: <br>  <b>640-802 CCNA</b> <br><br>  Or two: <br>  <b>640-822 ICND1</b> <b><br></b>  <b>640-816 ICND2</b> <br><br>  The surest is the first way, even psychologically;) <br><br>  Exam 640-802 consists of <b>50-60 questions</b> for which 90 minutes are given if you take the test in Russian or <b>120 if in English</b> (+30 additional minutes). <br>  Cost: 250 $ -290 $ <br>  Here is what they answered in the center redcenter.ru: <br> <code>¬´ . <br>       ,     .   CCNA     <b><u>$290           18%.</u></b> <br>         ,        ,    . <br>     ,    .       ,         (, , ,    ,  ( )   ).      .¬ª</code> <br> <br>  What topics are included in the exam: <br><br>  Attention, this is the most important point! <br>  Before you go to take, be sure to verify your knowledge! <br>  A list of topics (which may be, but it is also possible to expand the list without notification) is available <a href="https://cisco.hosted.jivesoftware.com/community/certifications/ccna/ccna_exam%3Fview%3Doverview">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  How to prepare </h4><br><br><ul><li>  Preparation on the official courses of Cisco ICDN </li><li>  Cisco CCNA Academy Training </li><li>  Self-training </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Preparation on the official courses of Cisco ICDN </h4><br><br>  As it should be, Cisco has its authorized exam preparation courses. <br>  For example, their cost and list can be read <a href="http://www.specialist.ru/Cisco/">here.</a> <br><br>  On each part (Entry and ICDN) you will be given a set of manuals in Russian Study Guides: <br>  Part 1. Volume 1 <br>  Part 1. Volume 2 <br>  Part 1. Laboratory <br><br>  Part 2. Volume 1 <br>  Part 2. Volume 2 <br>  Part 2. Laboratory <br><br>  As I was told, on the exam there can only be what was included in these manuals. <br>  In addition, your teacher can give you your laboratory options, such as I had. <br>  At the end of the course you will be given a piece of paper, which must be shown to the authorities and immediately thrown out.  It has no value. <br>  The advantage of the courses is that you work with real equipment on them, you can touch <s>or break</s> .  The teacher will answer all your questions.  And most importantly, he will share his experience and tell a lot of superfluous (useful).  In theory, you can then immediately pass the exam.  But I recommend everyone to take the time.  The average preparation time is from 6 months (taking into account work, study and free time). <br><br>  Courses are expensive for us, but free, if you send them to the bosses;) <br><br>  At the end of the article, I put% of someone‚Äôs% reference to the entire Study Guide kit and additional lab photos, which% to someone% the instructor gave on the courses. <br><br><h4>  Cisco CCNA Academy Training </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d4d/254/290/d4d25429057021e0718f30410420a856.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The Academy offers two courses: <br>  CCNA Exploration 4 (Advanced) and CCNA Discovery 4 (Entry Level) <br>  I waited an advanced course for half a year until I was opened at the university for free. <br>  And so this course also costs money. <br>  The Academy consists of 4 semesters, which very fully describe and tell about Cisco and network technologies using examples and laboratory work. <br>  The course itself is a flash presentation with tests and interactive content. <br><br>  On torrents.ru there is the entire course in the local form =) <br><br>  After each chapter, you must pass the test. <br>  In case of successful completion of the academy, you can be given a voucher for a 60% discount on the CCNA exam itself. <br><img src="http://s51.radikal.ru/i132/0903/88/1e9b44994caf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  An interactive map of training centers is located here: <a href="https://www.academynetspace.com/">https://www.academynetspace.com/</a> <br><br>  At the end of the article, I put% of someone% of links to the Packet Tracer 5.1 emulator under Windows and Linux with additional materials. <br><br><h4>  Self-training </h4><br><br>  This is the most interesting section, as it is included in any of the preparation methods. <br><br>  Materials for preparation: <br>  1) Authorized textbooks issued on courses.  At a minimum, you need to solve the tests at the end of chapters and labs to do everything. <br>  2) If there is an opportunity, then read the entire Exploration academy from the tracker. <br>  3) Book to prepare: <br>  CCNA Official Exam Certification Library, Wendell Odom, Two Volume <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Official-Certification-Library-640-802-Guide/dp/1587201836/ref%3Dpd_bbs_sr_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1236216784%26sr%3D8-1">www.amazon.com/Official-Certification-Library-640-802-Guide/dp/1587201836/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1236216784&amp;sr=8-1</a> <br>  The second edition is at the end of the article. <br><br>  The first book (CCENT) is in Russian for sale -1000r. <br>  <a href="http://www.bolero.ru/books/9785845914392.html%3Fterms%3D%25EE%25E4%25EE%25EC">www.bolero.ru/books/9785845914392.html?terms=%EE%E4%EE%EC</a> <br><br>  There is also a large two-volume program of the Network Academy Program.  Unfortunately, it is no longer relevant (regarding the exam program), so be careful about it. <br>  Found only the first book of the two: <br>  <a href="http://www.infanata.org/2006/08/08/programma_setevojj_akademii_cisco_ccna_1_i_2_vspomogatelnoe_rukovodstvo.html">www.infanata.org/2006/08/08/programma_setevojj_akademii_cisco_ccna_1_i_2_vspomogatelnoe_rukovodstvo.html</a> <br><br>  Personally, I recommend the Odom books, more than one generation of those who donated prepared for them. <br><br>  4) What to practice? <br><br>  You can practice on a live gland or on emulators. <br>  Live iron tsiski is expensive, but there are old models that can be bought on the forums. <br><br>  <b>Emulators:</b> <br><br>  To prepare you enough emulator <b>Packet Tracer 5.1</b> , which I attached to the article. <br>  It allows you to fully cost the network of varying complexity and reproduce all laboratory. <br><img src="http://s57.radikal.ru/i156/0903/97/9cea832f3c46.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second option is suitable <b>Router Sim</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/961/486/dab/961486dabecab7b6591e4e4e65fcb0ae.gif" alt="image"><br>  <a href="http://www.routersim.com/CCNA6_Screenshots.html">www.routersim.com/CCNA6_Screenshots.html</a> <br><br>  It contains a large number of pre-laboratories and is perfect for honing switching. <br><br>  There is also a <b>Dynamips</b> router emulator running on real IOSs.  But for CCNA, we simply don‚Äôt need its capabilities.  In particular, it does not emulate switches, which we will really need. <br><br><h4>  It is not enough for me! </h4><br><br>  There are many additional materials on the official Cisco exam preparation site: <br>  <a href="https://cisco.hosted.jivesoftware.com/community/certifications/ccna/ccna_exam%3Fview%3Doverview">https://cisco.hosted.jivesoftware.com/community/certifications/ccna/ccna_exam?view=overview</a> <br><br>  Therefore, you simply must register there at the time of preparation. <br><br><h4>  Dumps </h4><br><br>  What are dumps?  Dumps are a set of questions with answers that were on exams.  In fact, after learning dumps you can pass the exam without preparing.  But this is already your choice, for me, for example, knowledge is important. <br>  But of course it is quite normal after the preparation for the exam to solve and dumps. <br>  The best and most correct (all questions that will be) dumps are provided by Pass4Shure. <br>  At the end of the article, I provided a link that tells in more detail about the last dump at the time of this writing. <br><br><h4>  That's probably all </h4><br><br>  The article was quite voluminous, it is already 5 am and I want to sleep. <br>  In the evening I will answer your comments and maybe add to the article. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> : If someone needs someone, then I have 2 3620 routers without modules, in lichku. <br>  <b>PS2</b> : I wrote at night, please write about bugs in the comments <br>  <b>PS3</b> : Laboratory I will lay out in the evening. <br><br>  I hope you enjoy it and you repay me the same) <br><br>  <b>Editorial:</b> 0.1 beta <br><br>  - Added exact CCNA price in redcenter.ru, thanks <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/vedburtruba/" class="user_link">vedburtruba</a> <br><br>  <b>Added later:</b> And at the end of August I passed CCNA </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53591/</a></p>
