During my studies, I took from time to time some simple project worth $ 100 and wrote it within 2-3 days.  My particular freelance activity did not bring any special money, especially on Russian-speaking resources (I will write about comparing our freelance and foreign exchanges a bit later).  ‚ÄúI need to change something‚Äù - I thought then. <br><br>  But then came the long-awaited July.  There was a lot of free time, which did not want to spend to empty.  The first thing I did was to create the ‚ÄúFreelance‚Äù folder in the bookmarks of my browser and added the following exchanges there: <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://weblancer.net/">http://weblancer.net/</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.free-lance.ru/">http://www.free-lance.ru/</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.rentacoder.com/">http://www.rentacoder.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.odesk.com/">http://www.odesk.com/</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://guru.com/">http://guru.com/</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.elance.com/">http://www.elance.com/</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.getafreelancer.com/">http://www.getafreelancer.com/</a> </li></ol><br>  With Weblancer and Free-lance.ru, I have been familiar for more than a year.  Information about the rest found on the network.

    <h4>  RentACoder and Payoneer Card </h4><br>  The first overseas freelance market on this list is RentACoder or simply RAC.  C her and decided to start.  I think there are no questions why I became interested in foreign resources.  After registering, studying the RAC interface and filling out information about myself, I thought about how I get my money.  In Russia and the CIS countries there are Webmoney, Yandex. Money and more.  And how to be here if you do not want to bother with checks?  It turned out that the problem is solved very simply - through a Payoneer debit card with its minimum interest and money transfer rate.  You can order a card for free directly to the RAC by clicking on the link to the Payoneer website.  This is what I did.  Filled all the necessary information and sent a request.  Immediately the mail received a notice that the data will be processed soon.  By the way, you can specify the minimum amount that can be displayed on the map.  Conveniently.  I set $ 500.  Getting the card takes from 15 days (if you live in a large city) and up to 2 months (if in the outback).  My personal RAC card came yesterday!  It took about three weeks to deliver the card.  In my opinion, this is just fine, because  I live not in the city, but in a village 40 km away.  From him. <br><br>  You can order a withdrawal and check the balance on the card at <a href="http://www.payoneer.com/">www.payoneer.com</a> .  Very pleased with the presence of Russian-language support.  If you have questions, you can always write a letter to support@payoneer.ru. <br><br>  Now a little about the price of service card, etc .: <br><ol><li>  Card activation: $ 9.95 (The amount is withdrawn once, when you first refill the card) </li><li>  Card Replacement: $ 9.95 (Payment is made once - when a replacement card is needed) </li><li>  Monthly fee: $ 3.00 ($ 3 each month is charged for services ‚Äî you can always spend 100 rubles a month) </li><li>  Withdrawing money through ATMs outside of America: $ 2.15 (If for some reason money is refused, then the procedure costs $ 0.90) </li><li>  Depositing through checks: $ 5.00 for the first time, and all other deposits of $ 2.00 </li><li>  Replenishment of an account using Visa or MasterCard: 3.5% of the amount (the amount comes within 24‚àí48 hours) </li></ol><br>  The maximum daily withdrawal amount is $ 1000.  When withdrawing money from an ATM, be sure to go to the site and check your balance.  If there is no money, the ATM can block and not return the card.  Then you have to restore it.  If there is no desire to withdraw at ATMs for $ 1000, then you can contact the bank and withdraw money at the box office.  Do not forget your passport!  Commission for withdrawal is 2%, but you can withdraw more than $ 1000. <br><br>  I was pleased that you can transfer money from other credit cards and from a bank account to a Payoneer card without any problems.  The person who translates you needs to know only your e-mail, under which you are registered on the site <a href="http://www.payoneer.com/">www.payoneer.com</a> .  Informing about the card number is not desirable for security reasons. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65825/</a></p>
