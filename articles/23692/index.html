  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Everything is changing for the better!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As a matter of fact, today in one of the blogs I read that a certain startup called <a href="http://www.promenyal.ru/">Change</a> , started selecting bloggers to test the project.  There are 10 days left until the end of registration for testing.  What is interesting - the project has nothing to do with blogs, moreover they are not there at all. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/a0c/0cb/f4a/a0c0cbf4aeb3a12e2888ab1f00e74cec.jpg" width="265" height="111" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Nevertheless <a href="http://www.promenyal.ru/about/">, judging by the description</a> , the <a href="http://www.promenyal.ru/about/">idea is really interesting</a> .  Therefore, I, as usual, decided to talk with one of the creators of the project.  I managed to reach him through ICQ, his name is Alexander.  Here are excerpts from our conversation: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Tell us more about the resource.</strong> <br>  8 months of development, the original idea, several purchase offers even before launch, plus what is written now <a href="http://www.promenyal.ru/about/">about the project</a> is all that I am ready to tell now. <br>  <strong>What are you hoping for by creating a Traded?</strong> <br>  Looking forward to success.  Before starting to write TK, we all carefully studied and concluded that there is a problem with the exchange of things.  Our study began banal, in the office of 200 people.  It all started with a poll in the smoking room, one of the employees was asked, ‚Äú <em>Do you have at home something that you can‚Äôt throw out and sell?‚Äù</em>  <em>Would you change?</em>  ", She replied:" <em>Yes, I was presented with a bottle of Hennesi, and I myself do not drink.</em>  <em>It would be better if men's slippers were presented by somebody</em> . ‚Äù  Immediately connected another employee, " <em>Listen to, and I have slippers, let me change to Henesi</em> ."  Then the third employee joined the conversation.  In general, after 3 hours, 15 exchanges were made. <br>  <strong>And then decided to do?</strong> <br>  No, after that we conducted a series of more detailed studies.  In general, the problem with the exchange of things - there is.  But there are no services that would help to do this systematically - not just a la ad newspaper, but that everything is automated.  We have created such a service.  In order to change, we simply need to click the ‚Äúoffer exchange‚Äù buttons on the page of the lot you like.  It is very convenient. <br><br>  <strong>Who is this service for?</strong> <br>  Well, firstly for those who urgently need to exchange something for something.  For collectors.  And thirdly for those who are constantly changing with something, such as movie discs.  Now the need for video rental will disappear, since you can change for free, with the same users as you.

      <strong>Why did you decide to test bloggers for testing?</strong>  <strong>Honestly.</strong> <br>  Because this is the most active audience (the fact that they are blogging speaks about it).  We need people who, while testing, will not just stare, but help, give advice, try to make the service more convenient before the public launch. <br><br>  <strong>And why ask and point out on your blog to get to testing?</strong> <br>  Because it works as proof of the fact that it is the person registered with us, is the author of the blog.  We do not ask to write about us only good.  You can even write nothing at all, but simply put an invisible link.  We are important as proof of your involvement in this blog.  But I will not hide, I would like the posts in their blogs to work to attract new users. <br><br>  <strong>When are you planning to launch the public version of the project?</strong> <br>  This will depend on the testers we are currently recruiting.  I think that this will not happen very soon, as it is necessary to completely break in, not only technical, but also some conceptual points. <br><br>  PS - and do not kick me, for what I posted here this post, to pass the job on the exchange.  Yes, it is partly so.  I do not have my blog, but I want to get to testing.  But I think I did enough work (I found the owner, I interviewed) for Habr so that I wouldn‚Äôt get karma, but they would add the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/23692/">https://habr.com/ru/post/23692/</a></p>
