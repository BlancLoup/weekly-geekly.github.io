Apple, of course, foresaw this and prepared a unique device that has no analogues on the market yet.  Phone, GPS-navigator, browser, many other functions - and it all fits in the palm of your hand;  and of course, like all Apple products, has a stylish design. <br><br>  The new gadget is called Apple iMac Mini - this is a real full-fledged computer with a powerful processor.  However, first things first. <br><br>  Under the cut photos and screenshots.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We were lucky to get in touch with Apple and get a sample of Aymak Mini for testing.  Yes, it is Aymak Mini that, according to the company‚Äôs statement, not only the device menu will be Russified, but all the inscriptions on the case.  ‚ÄúWe always strive to maximize the comfort of ordinary users,‚Äù says the marketing director of Apple‚Äôs Russian division, ‚ÄúAnd we couldn‚Äôt overlook the fact that Russification is often incomplete, which confuses users and increases the burden on technical support.  With Aimak Mini, this archaism is a thing of the past - not a single non-Russian letter will remain in the device. ‚Äù <br><br>  It is no secret that a significant part of the buyers of Apple products are young and motivated people, so the opportunity to express themselves is one of the most important criteria that guide customers when choosing a device.  Aimak Mini will be produced in several colors - from romantic and charming pink to passionate and noble purple. <br><br><img src="http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/6938/5cbb3.jpg" alt="5 mini aimaks in different colors"><br><br>  As you can see, on the left are the phone buttons, on the right are the buttons for managing the newly redesigned universal interface.  The company has not yet disclosed its secrets, but it promises that Aimak Mini will revolutionize the usability of interfaces in the next one or two years. <br><br>  From the scant information on the back of the device, we learn the following: <br><br><img src="http://img230.imageshack.us/img230/4607/backsidenk5.jpg" alt="Aimak Mini Back Cover"><br><br>  - The device serial number is ‚Äúsewn‚Äù directly into the back cover, which 100% excludes the program number change by flashing. <br>  - Date of production of this technological sample - 03.08.  Considering the delivery time from China, we, most likely, were the first lucky ones who had the chance to write a review about this pocket miracle. <br>  - ‚ÄúYablofon‚Äù - apparently, the working name of the device, an allusion to his younger brother, iPhone.  While it is not known what prompted Apple to change the name.  We hope to receive detailed comments on Aymaku Mini before its official release. <br>  - The extremely pleasant inscription on the right indicates that the retail price of the device will be only 40 euros. <br>  - Device "Made in China."  Apparently, Apple is not yet ready to transfer the production of localized apple apples to Russia. <br><br>  We got our hands, of course, a non-working sample used exclusively for promotional purposes.  However, bearing in mind, for example, AMD Duron Applebred processors, in which most of the L2 cache was turned on by simple soldering of contacts, we decided to try our luck with Aymak Mini. <br><br>  Quite a few soldering irons were broken about the impenetrable DRM of Yablofon, but in the end our engineers were able to get the device turned on, and then the desktop appeared before us: <br><br><img src="http://img230.imageshack.us/img230/5911/desktopxp9.jpg" alt="Aimak Mini Desktop Screenshot"><br><br>  Not surprisingly, Apple developers took care of the user - a pleasant green gamma, a comfortable level of brightness, a contrasting background, and constant ease of displaying information on the screen. <br><br>  Then we tried several more device modes.  GPS mode: <br><br><img src="http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/9594/gpsmodeba6.jpg" alt="IMac Mini GPS Mode"><br><br>  Simple web browser: <br><br> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/31337"><img src="http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/3453/eleetln7.jpg" alt="31337, eleet"></a> <br><br>  A bit about the "iron" stuffing device.  As you understand, this kind of novelty could not do without fantastic technical solutions.  Says Apple's engineer: <br><br><img src="http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/7730/inside1yb5.jpg" alt="Apple iMac Mini filling. Memristors."><br><br>  ‚ÄúEverything is simple here.  The number 1 denotes a wireless element with a UFO.  The only thing I can tell you is that it is made using an unprecedented 0.33 nm technology.  Take a look at the designation on the device.  I am not authorized to disclose any other information about this item. <br><br>  The number 2 denotes a 5 megabyte BIOS storage device.  Here we decided to use the traditional flash memory technology, but placed the crystal in a special cylindrical case of high-strength DRM, which eliminates unauthorized access to the boot data. <br><br>  And finally, the third.  A revolutionary new type of memory (780 MB).  The element is made on memristors, this technology is still poorly developed, therefore the amount of such memory is still very limited.  But look, the memristor block has only three outputs!  No other electronic device on <s>your</s> planet can boast such a degree of compressed data flow.  " <br><br>  We continued to get acquainted with the device.  As you know, the life of a regular phone without recharging the batteries of a battery is a maximum of 1-2 months, in a rare case - a year.  However, in the technical characteristics of the iMac Mini it was stated that it had worked for 42 years in standby mode and at least 13 years in communication mode with UFOs.  It was hard to believe these incredible numbers until we got to the source of energy of Yablofon, the nuclear power supply unit: <br><br><img src="http://img220.imageshack.us/img220/4070/inside2jb9.jpg" alt="Nuclear power unit"><br><br>  Returning to usability, it is worth noting that it was extremely pleasant to work with the keyboard of the device - a soft keystroke, pleasant tactile sensations.  The secret of this, as it turned out, is simple and does not belong to extraterrestrial technologies at all: <br><br>  &lt;img src = " <a href="">img220.imageshack.us/img220/198/keybrdii6.jpg</a> " alt = "iMac Mini Keyboard" '&gt; <br><br>  Under the keyboard are interesting patterns - inductive elements, made in the form of conductive tracks of the board.  When you bring your finger to the key changes, the slightest inductance changes are captured and recorded by the microprocessor. <br><br>  Microprocessor, we will finish our review today.  Here it is, the inaccessible heart of the apple: <br><br><img src="http://img292.imageshack.us/img292/9877/inside3qy1.jpg" alt="Large Integrated Circuit K145IK2P"><br><br>  All we can say is that the processor was produced in intel and its frequency is 2 petagerts.  Yes, with Apple you can‚Äôt be surprised. <br><br>  It's all for today.  But what surprises will Apple bring to us tomorrow? <br><br>  Thank you all for having remembered with me the times when the Big Integrated Circuits were really big. <br><br>  Photos were originally intended for <a href="http://razobrali.ru/">razobrali.ru</a> , but I was carried to the side ... <br><br>  <a href="http://www.hooey.ru/2008/05/05/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0-apple-imac-mini/">Crosspost</a> from my blog hooey.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24710/</a></p>
