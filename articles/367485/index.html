  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IBM Watson is now cooking for everyone.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://www.thestar.com.my/~/media/Images/TSOL/Photos-Upload/Food%20and%20Drink/2014/07/watson.ashx?w=620&amp;amp;h=413&amp;amp;crop=1&amp;amp;"><br><br>  If you want to try a new, unusual, unique dish, you should pay attention to Chef Watson.  This is one of the avatars of the IBM Watson supercomputer, which knows how to cook delicious dishes using self-made recipes. <br><br>  In principle, about this cook on Geektimes and Habr√© have already been written, so much is known.  But now the service has become available for everyone - its web version is <a href="https://www.ibmchefwatson.com/register%3FinvitationId%3Dhello">now open</a> .  Now it‚Äôs enough to indicate the main component of the dish, the type of dish and the region under which you want to ‚Äútune‚Äù your dish (well, for example, Olivier salad is typical for the CIS, chicken noodles are typical for China, etc.), and the computer will try to choose ingredients so that you get the desired dish, but with a "twist". <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition, the system evaluates each recipe (usually in each 12-24 ingredients) by the possible attractiveness of smell and taste, by its unusualness and by some other parameters.  A little later, the project team says, Watson will be able to create recipes with step-by-step cooking instructions.  More recently, Chef has offered its own recipe for cooking kebabs.  The service chose ingredients such as pork, chicken, strawberries, shiitake mushrooms, pineapple, apples, green onions, carrots, lemon, lime, mint, and curry.  Estimated tasters (professional chefs) turned out pretty tasty.

      By the way, representatives of the Bon Appetit magazine team also worked on the application.  The service was tested for eleven months, during which time many different dishes were prepared, which were highly appreciated by those who tried these dishes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe advantage of Watson is the search for relationships in arrays of data that will allow us to see potential combinations of ingredients that we did not know about before,‚Äù said Dr. Steve Adams, Distinguished Engineer and Head of IBM Watson.  - Using Watson in culinary art shows how people make discoveries with smart devices.  Our technologies allow us to reach a new level not only for amateur cooks, but also for professionals from many other fields, from biologists to fashion experts. ‚Äù <br><br>  Over the past year, IBM and Bon App√©tit have also improved the application interface based on the ‚ÄúWatson Chef‚Äù usage scenarios in creating new recipes.  Users can now begin to discover new flavor combinations by selecting just one ingredient.  Based on this data, Watson Chef will offer three other ingredients that, according to the cognitive system, will go well with each other.  ‚ÄúWatson Chef‚Äù makes experiments with flavors more accessible for cooking, offering ideas for dishes and quantities of ingredients, as well as cooking tips that will help chefs choose their own recipe and share their experiences with friends. <br><br>  The application, which was in beta until today, was used by several thousand experienced home cooks who helped expand the IBM Watson knowledge base.  This was achieved, including thanks to user feedback on recipes and a convenient application scenario.  Beta users have also found new, useful ways to use the app ‚Äî for example, to prepare tasty dishes without using certain ingredients or replacing them with dietary or health conditions;  to reduce the amount of food waste, using rare ingredients;  for use in the preparation of seasonal or local products in order to popularize the farm-to-table model;  as well as to teach children creativity and principles of healthy eating. <br><br>  I wonder what recipe Chef Watson can make for kebabs?  Need to try. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367485/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367485/</a></p>
