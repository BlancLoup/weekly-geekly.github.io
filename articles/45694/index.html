  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Down with the language barrier - 3. Unexpected results!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For those who do not understand why the title of the post indicates part 3, here are links to 2 previous parts: the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/45147/">first</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/45208/">second</a> . <br><br>  <b>And in this post I will talk about the results of the correspondence with the translation bureau, about what the publication of the idea on Habr√© led to and what to do next.</b> <br><br><h4>  First of all </h4><br>  As I have already described the description of my idea, I sent out a dozen major translation agencies.  In the letters I introduced myself as one of the developers of this project.  He said that the project was allegedly at the testing stage.  But this is not the point, my task was to find out the interest of the bureau representatives.  Also in the letter I warned that in the case of cooperation, we are interested in good discounts on their work, that is, we will work at prices lower than those indicated on these sites.  Of the ten companies, eight answered.  I do not think that I have the right to publish the names of these offices, since they did not give me that right, but I will publish the results.

      One office immediately replied: <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  <i>Prices for our services are listed on the site.</i> </blockquote><br>  That's how you want it and understand.  I realized that they were not disposed to cooperate, or they misunderstood my proposal. <br><br>  <b>But with the rest everything turned out to be much more interesting</b> .  3 companies expressed interest and requested more detailed information, just asked for a link to the resource in question. <br><br>  The remaining 4, after the lines that the project is very interesting for them, were invited to the office to discuss the terms of cooperation.  I repeat, they invited not to discuss the possibility of cooperation, but to talk about the conditions.  I was ready for such answers, but I was pleasantly surprised by the answer from one company, here‚Äôs an extract from the manager‚Äôs answer: <br><blockquote>  <i>We would be interested to cooperate with you on exclusive conditions.</i>  <i>We ourselves have long thought about a web service that would help to reach the global level.</i>  <i>Frankly, your idea is what we were looking for.</i>  <i>If you are interested in it, we could discuss the possibility of our participation in the project as co-founders.</i>  <i>Theoretically, we are interested in the partial or full financing of your project, for the ownership of shares.</i>  <i>To do this, we offer to meet to discuss the conditions and details.</i> </blockquote><br>  Honestly, I <b>did not expect this</b> .  Well, of course, I did not meet with anyone, because my goal was to check the interest in this topic.  I checked, shared with you. <br><br><h4>  Secondly. </h4><br>  <b>The result of publishing this idea on Habr√© was unexpected</b> .  I said from the very beginning that I was not going to implement this idea.  There are many reasons for this: there is no time, another source of income, and most importantly, I don‚Äôt strongly believe in this idea in order to invest in it. <br><br>  But, the idea seemed interesting and promising to many.  A couple of dozens of people who offered help with the implementation responded - I will repeat it, in spite of the fact that I wrote ‚ÄúI am not going to implement‚Äù.  They were mostly programmers, but there are a couple of marketers.  In general, all this prompted me to the idea - ‚Äú <b>And why not?</b>  ". <br><br>  Of course, the idea is interesting, but still I think it is very risky.  Highly.  Therefore, I don‚Äôt intend to invest in it on a large scale as before.  However, <i>I</i> don‚Äôt intend to think later on the topic ‚Äú <i>and maybe it would be true</i> ‚Äù.  The people who wrote to me made it clear that together you can take and try to do with minimal risks.  It does not matter whether or not.  Just take and do everything together, <b>if only for the sake of experiment</b> , at least to fill the cones, at least with an absolute guarantee to say - " <i>This idea is not working, here are the proofs</i> ."  But I would certainly like to say at the output - ‚Äú <b>And who said that the idea is not working, eh?</b>  ". <br><br><h4>  What's next. </h4><br>  In general, we unite to try.  But what is most interesting, we will do the project in the open mode.  In general, in the reality show mode.  Every step, all debates and discussions of developers will be visible to everyone.  Since the name of the project has not yet been thought out, the address has not yet been registered, we will work in the ‚Äú <a href="http://bezadresa.ru/">No Address</a> ‚Äù blog. <br><br>  In general, I registered this name for another project that I was going to do shortly.  The resource should have been devoted to several interesting topics, including experiments on the Internet.  So I think that the creation of this project is also a kind of experiment, so one does not interfere with the other. <br><br>  In fact, we are going to do the first national project.  We absolutely do not think about earnings and so on.  <b>The goal is to find out whether it will succeed or not</b> , if it succeeds, we will decide on this development. <br><br>  Now we have programmers, marketers, copywriters.  <b>But we do not refuse any help</b> .  If you have a desire to join you, there is practically nothing stopping you.  Everyone can contribute to the common cause.  It is only important to have any skills or abilities.  Think about how you can be helpful.  Maybe you are a good programmer or designer?  Or do you know how to write texts super?  Or are you well-versed in online advertising?  Or do you have good connections?  Or you can not do anything, but you are interested in the project and you are ready to perform routine work, moderation for example?  Thought, now come to us and tell about it. <br><br>  The team is still in the formative stage.  There is still time.  By the way, those who will take part in the development, on a blog without an address will be seen much more than just the viewers. <br><br>  Now, first of all we need to decide on the name, finally approve the concept and get to work.  By the way, if someone can come up with a good name for the project, and check if this name is taken - write me about it (you can here in a personal). <br><br>  In general, by common forces we will succeed.  By the way, on a site <a href="http://bezadresa.ru/">without an address</a> we will do not only this project, but also a number of others.  So join, maybe your idea will eventually be realized.  So far, without an address, it looks like a WordPress blog, but this is because I deployed it in a hurry.  And the main engine is being finalized, the design is also under development.  In general, this will not be just a blog, but I will tell you about it later. <br><br>  And ... <b>guys, support us</b> .  We really want to do something useful and interesting, and very worried.  Well, really.  The more of us, the stronger we are. <br><br>  Well, all further instructions are located at ... in general, <a href="http://bezadresa.ru/">without an address</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/45694/">https://habr.com/ru/post/45694/</a></p>
