  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bicycle infrastructure in Minsk for IT expatriates</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uo/vu/-z/uovu-zq_idojg1cyxfdgab8eahm.jpeg"><br><br>  After the adoption of the decree ‚ÄúOn the Development of the Digital Economy‚Äù, the Belarusian <a href="http://www.park.by/">High-Tech Park</a> began to grow actively with new companies, and the existing residents were even more willing to invite specialists from abroad.  A significant part of the invitees are residents of the countries of the former USSR, for whom, despite the common past, some features of moving around Minsk on a bicycle can be a surprise.  If you are thinking about moving to Belarus or already in the process and want to use the bike as a transport, this material may be useful to you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Traffic Laws </h3><br>  The biggest surprise for a beginner may be a ban on cycling on the carriageway.  Yes, in Belarus it is possible to ride a bike only by bicycle or on a footpath.  On the road, you can only go when it is impossible to move along the sidewalk and cycle path, whatever that means, according to the drafters of the Rules. <br><br>  At the end of 2019, it is planned to adopt a <a href="http://forumpravo.by/files/projekt_zakon_dorozhnoe_dvizhenie.pdf">new edition of the traffic rules</a> , where, in theory, they may be allowed to drive on certain roads.  But while this is only a bill, and in what form it will be adopted, it is difficult to say.  Therefore, keep in mind: for driving on the carriageway you can easily and completely legally be fined in the amount of ~ 12 to ~ 36USD in equivalent.  Naturally, it is not accepted to agree with the traffic police and it is much more dangerous for the wallet than the usual fine.

      Another feature is that it is also impossible to move by bicycle at a crosswalk, if there is no special sign.  That is, in the usual "zebra" cyclist must go on foot and drive a bicycle nearby.  Fortunately, there are more and more places where you don‚Äôt need to go off the bike, and if amendments to the traffic rules are adopted, you will have to dismount only at unregulated pedestrian crossings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ng/zk/hn/ngzkhnidfpig7tcwtpmqb5kqmpg.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Infrastructure </h3><br>  In the past few years, new bicycle lanes on the sidewalks are actively appearing in Minsk.  They are simply painted with paint, as a rule, from the side of the roadway and denoted by road markings and signs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zm/es/jw/zmesjwvgmj7uthn6v75heoj4atm.jpeg"><br><br>  In places where bike lanes are interrupted, curb stones are usually understated, so you should not buy a special bicycle to ‚Äújump on curbs‚Äù - a regular urban or hybrid on a rigid fork will do. <br><br>  Do not choose single-speed bikes, if you are not confident in your abilities - the relief difference in Minsk is more than 100 meters.  The central part of the city is located in a valley, so it can be uncomfortable to return to ‚Äúsleeping bags‚Äù without a reserve of 3-5 gears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4a/sq/-5/4asq-5_t_dhyojky05yaehzoiva.jpeg"><br><br>  In 2009, a 27-km-long central bike path was opened in the city.  It passes through the whole of Minsk from the northwest to the southeast along the Svisloch River.  On the bike path, it is convenient to move around the central part of the city or go there from the outskirts to get to the center, with minimal distractions from pedestrians and traffic lights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3dc/838/9b4/3dc8389b43a5cd1a27d8438c8a2762f3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <a href="https://www.urbanoid.by/article/lr9JVpXvGA">A source</a> <br><br>  Not very convenient is that a lot of bike paths, which are simply marked on the sidewalk, are tiled.  It would be more comfortable and faster to drive on smooth asphalt, but this can probably be explained by the lack of budget for laying individual tracks, and not by the conscious decision of the designers. <br><br>  There is no modern bicycle rental in Minsk.  There are seasonal rental points of sports equipment, but the appearance of bicycle-sharing services, which are used to residents of European cities, is not expected in the city. <br><br>  Stationary indoor bicycle parking is also a rarity.  Sometimes some advanced developer or the residents themselves can raise money and build a parking lot, but for now this is probably the exception.  Most bicycles are stored either in apartments or in the entrances of houses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d3/wg/pe/d3wgpe7pdvyd_la5w0sma14jtdy.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  Culture </h3><br>  In most cases, problems with pedestrians and motorists on the way will not.  People are gradually becoming accustomed to the fact that more and more cyclists appear in the city every year, so going out on a cycle path or not passing a car at the crossing is quite a rare phenomenon.  Older people or ladies with wheelchairs can walk along the bike path, but this is a rarity, and most often it is enough to signal a person to get off the track.  The younger generation and those who live in Minsk for some time already know about the rules of behavior, and problems usually do not arise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uk/9j/bs/uk9jbsfd6vov5j3dofewkeqtsco.jpeg"><br>  <i>Pictured: people walk side by side for pedestrians</i> <br><br>  There is no special attitude or disregard for cyclists, very few people will judge the prosperity or social status of a person by the fact that he comes to work by bicycle.  For example, in Belarusian villages, bicycle is often the main mode of transport, so your cycling for business will probably not cause surprise. <br><br><h3>  Security </h3><br>  Compared to major European cities, Minsk is a safe city and bicycles are rarely stolen here.  According to an approximate estimate, there are now 400,000 bicycles in Minsk, and thefts are registered around 400-600 per year.  Cycle parking in one form or another is quite common, but usually it is the cheapest design with mounting for the front wheel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hs/1e/xr/hs1exrygydvuto56edfyynhh0uu.jpeg"><br><br>  Most owners attach their bicycles with inexpensive cable locks, so if you use a chain or lock, the chance that your bike will be stolen is minimal, unless it is your thief that is being hunted. <br><br>  As an extra measure of protection, a bicycle can be insured.  In Minsk, these services are offered by two companies, on average, it will cost 6-10% per year of the cost of a bicycle. <br><br><h3>  Service and spare parts </h3><br>  With this, everything is not good in Minsk - mainly the cheapest components of Chinese, Russian, and sometimes Taiwanese manufacturers sell in stores.  The range is small due to the fact that the supplier of many sellers is the same.  Mail ordering parts and accessories is also not always profitable and convenient because of the low limit on duty-free import of international parcels - in order not to pay a fee of 30% of the cost, the goods in the parcel should not be valued above 22 euros. <br><br>  Cycle services exist, as a rule, at bicycle shops or in garages, but do not count on their high quality.  Servicing and setting up a rare / expensive bike can also be problematic, including due to the lack of spare parts. <br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  As a transport, not to mention fitness or entertainment, it is quite comfortable to use a bicycle in Minsk - there are more cyclists, and after that the infrastructure develops.  The climate allows you to use the bike without any problems from April to November, but some cyclists ride all year round. <br><br>  In general, if you love a bicycle - Minsk will become a friendly city for you. <br><br>  <b>UPD: The</b> text is the opinion of a person who has lived in Minsk for 37 years and uses a bicycle as the main mode of transport. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450744/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450744/</a></p>
