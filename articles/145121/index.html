It is too early to give links to anything, I can only say that it is free, and I want to learn how to make convenient and useful applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7c0/beb/9b8/7c0beb9b8ebff43eb3e4caabcf03f57a.jpg">

      The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsharing a location is simple, understandable, and many try to implement it.  And here the details begin. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Overview </h2><br><br>  Of course, there are a lot of applications of this type, but I tried to limit myself to less or less adequate applications, where there is at least some functionality and not in Chinese. <br><br><h3>  Let's start with Apple <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/find-my-friends/id466122094">Find My Friends</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3a9/fa9/809/3a9fa98095ba2e4ede543f7cf763f102.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5db/faf/19b/5dbfaf19b35dbc4f3e43f413e1a8e2b6.jpg"><br>  We are encouraged to keep a list of friends - those Apple IDs we want to add.  In this case, a friend must allow us to transfer your location.  The interface consists of two parts: a list of contacts and a map.  And it is important that it is suggested to start working in the part of the screen with a list, and only then the map changes depending on your actions.  In addition to the general list with all your friends, you can create temporary groups to quickly see where someone is from the group.  In this case, besides the very coordinates of the person, we know when this point was sent.  And here is the most interesting thing: besides the usual tracking with periodic (very rare) sending by phone the position to the server, which would create a lag in tracking for a few minutes, they directly ask the device at the moment when a friend requests its location.  This is their strong advantage - getting a point at the moment ‚Äúnow‚Äù, although it‚Äôs not clear whether they use any iOS hacks that are prohibited by a regular developer, or they manage the behavior of VoIP and Geo applications introduced in iOS5.  Only one unpleasant limitation remains - the application works only on Apple devices.  To start using the application, it is enough to have an Apple ID. <br><br><h3>  Its main competitor from Google, in my humble opinion </h3><br>  Google Latitude on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.google.android.apps.maps">Android</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-latitude/id306586497">iPhone</a> .  And on BlackBerry, Symbian and Windows Mobile as part of the <a href="http://www.google.ru/mobile/maps/">Maps</a> application. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb3/e71/56f/fb3e7156f257d6035cd2b63c7c571809.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/515/23c/7df/51523c7df5eb03943f3611f409a1dae5.jpg"><br>  We describe in the same manner. <br>  We are encouraged to keep a list of friends - those Google Account, whom we wanted to add.  The main element of the interface in this application is the map, it is from it that we are supposed to start working, on it is all the functionality.  Users can customize which location will be available to friends: the current, selected manually or none.  By analogy with the previous application, in addition to the person‚Äôs coordinates, we know when this point was sent.  To update the point in the ‚Äúcurrent location‚Äù privacy mode, normal tracking is performed with the phone periodically sending its position to the server.  In the case of manual installation, the user himself indicates the coordinates of his location.  There is only one unpleasant restriction - only users with Google Account participate. <br><br><h3>  Another way to share your location: Glympse </h3><br>  Again, there are for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.glympse.android.glympse">Android</a> , and for the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/glympse-free-location-share/id330316698">iPhone</a> .  And there is for <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/17002/">BlackBerry</a> , <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-US/apps/ec418e52-b788-e011-986b-78e7d1fa76f8">Windows Phone 7</a> , <a href="http://glympse.com/get/winmo/">Windows Mobile</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ba/e24/0c9/7bae240c9f492264f36a0a8bd796f6bf.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c2e/204/486/c2e204486ca34ac77bc2a87b98228233.jpg"><br>  Glympse allows anyone to send a certain token through which they can track the user's location.  The token adjusts its lifetime, as well as the message and the place where the user expects to get.  The interface uses only a map where it displays the current movement that the user has shared.  In this case, the coordinate during tracking is sent every few seconds.  And the main advantage is that the recipient of the token does not need to install the application, he can look after the user through the web interface.  In addition to this, the application does not require registration.  Specify Twitter or Facebook accounts only to send a token through these services. <br><br><h3>  Do not share, but find out the location in echoecho </h3><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.echoecho.android">Android</a> , <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/echoecho/id338883714">iPhone</a> , <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/4514/%3Flang%3Den">BlackBerry</a> , <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/ru-RU/apps/804cc0b4-ed0a-4951-9ea5-dcca0c5e3308">Windows Phone 7</a> , <a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/113246">Symbian are</a> supported. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10f/8b9/692/10f8b9692d85aeb49b7d61ea7af2199d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0b0/cf3/b7b/0b0cf3b7b4ff96eaad800e28cf9475e9.jpg"><br>  In echoecho, the principle of user interaction is built upon a request.  If the user wants to know the location of a friend, he obviously asks about it.  A friend either explicitly answers this request, or sets up an auto answer.  In this case, the developers have added a chip from Glympse - you can send a Live request, which, when accepted, for some time constantly updates the location.  It would seem that the functionality is ready, but the developers went further and added a chat for the exchange of simple text messaging and a primitive system for organizing meetings.  Moreover, when organizing meetings to indicate the place, they for some reason use their extremely meager base of establishments, therefore for the time being it is much more convenient to schedule the meeting.  All this functionality works in relation to the interface card.  The main advantage - work on all popular platforms.  For the application to work, you need to register by sending SMS to them on the server.  And in case of refusal, you can request an SMS from them or a call by which you can find out the code that needs to be interrupted in the application. <br><br><h3>  Find out the location differently in WAY? </h3><br>  Only <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.inteligeo.whereareyou">Android</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/w.a.y./id531263000">iPhone are</a> supported.  <s>Although the iPhone version has not been updated for a long time, but it works.</s> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb8/308/37b/fb830837bc72404ddeb63c9579023377.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b10/fb2/860/b10fb2860bdc75cd2ab5ca057252e896.jpg"><br>  WAY developers?  at the time of this writing, the interface has somehow changed dramatically.  Previously, when I watched this application, it consisted of a menu with a bunch of screens, and now the main part of the interface has become a map and it is suggested to start working from it.  Earlier in the application was the item ‚ÄúMy family‚Äù, but in the new version it is not, which is a pity.  Similar to the echoecho, the principle of interaction is built upon a request.  There is also a list of friends that you can ask.  You can also send your location to a friend without any questions.  And, of course, there is an auto-answer setting.  Incidentally, when switching to a new interface, they removed the comment function applied to the location being sent, which was very convenient.  IMHO, nothing was removed!  For the application to work, you need to register by sending SMS to them on the server.  Unfortunately, no alternative options are offered.  The main advantage is that they are our Russian ones, so the registration SMS cost as usual SMS.  And I was somewhat amused by the characters added to my list of friends: Godzilla, Nessie, Cthulhu, the developer, and some other things that are not understandable to me.  Hopefully Cthulhu will never budge. <br><br><h3>  Follow family, children in Foot Prints </h3><br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/find-my-kids-footprints/id400119299">IPhone</a> only supported <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb5/ef2/4bc/fb5ef24bcf502528ae8c807d35834be0.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/475/208/9c7/4752089c74deefe46482e007eced2136.jpg"><br>  Unlike previous applications in Foot Prints, the main user action is to view the passed points with an indication of time.  The entire interface is a map with many transparent panels.  Each user on the map leaves traces - coordinates with the passage time.  You can see where everything is now, and wherever someone could be at some time.  To track a user, he must give personal tracking permission.  For the full operation of the application, registration by e-mail and mobile phone is required.  It is "and."  During registration, they send a code that must be specified in the application.  This is the only app in the review that requires money at the end of the 30-day free period.  Buy a subscription for 3/12/24 months. <br><br><h3>  Similar tracking in life360 </h3><br>  <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dcom.life360.android.safetymapd">Android</a> , <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/life360-family-tracker/id384830320">iPhone</a> , <a href="http://appworld.blackberry.com/webstore/content/95516/">BlackBerry</a> , Windows Phone 7 are supported (it is noted on the site that it will be soon). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a80/60b/0e8/a8060b0e83a5f62fe30768ecf6c0f1b6.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ea/fee/18c/2eafee18c857b2cfc8dee70363eee85c.jpg"><br>  The most thoughtful at the moment the application for tracking the family.  Everything is visible on the general map.  In addition to trivial location polls, you can perform more specific queries.  For example, the requirement to check-in their state: ‚ÄúAll is well‚Äù, ‚ÄúI need help‚Äù.  Even without a request, you can send check-ins that all is well.  And the coolest feature is the Alarm button, which sends out to everyone who is on the family list a ‚ÄúPanic Alert‚Äù message with location coordinates and the suggestion to call 911. Side functions are also interesting: the list of police stations and hospitals in the district, the ability to view the movement track in history sort of chat with family.  However, with all this, the application is too complicated in terms of working with the user.  To register in the application, you must specify your e-mail and password and then use them to log in.  And introduced the concept of a family administrator, ultimately managing the list. <br><br><h2>  Few thoughts </h2><br>  There are a lot of useful ideas in the field of geolocation, and many of them have not yet been implemented.  But even if the application is useful, it still needs a user-friendly interface.  Otherwise no one will notice the benefit. <br>  The review can be divided into two main areas: <br><ol><li>  List - a list of friends, contacts, family, in general, any list of people whose location you want to know or who would like to report about it </li><li>  Card - one card with management on it and auxiliary lists </li></ol><br>  Needs also have a significant separation: <br><ol><li>  Share with friends or find out where they are. </li><li>  Follow your loved ones in a good way and not only </li></ol><br>  Finally, the logic of work can be organized in two ways: <br><ol><li>  Periodically send coordinates to the server </li><li>  Send coordinates to request from user </li></ol><br><br>  And how do you, habrovchane, use geolocation applications and for what?  What do you like about them? <br>  I would like a constructive discussion. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  The authors of ‚ÄúWAY?‚Äù Asked me to update the article.  It turns out their latest version in the AppStore is called "WAY" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/145121/">https://habr.com/ru/post/145121/</a></p>
