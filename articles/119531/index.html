And I especially liked Desire S - even though it is not top-rated now (Sensation was recently announced), but it‚Äôs perfectly balanced, and even very picky comrades say in one voice that it‚Äôs cool. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  Soft touch plastic is, of course, good, but metal is in fashion now, so it‚Äôs not surprising that Desire S has got an aluminum unibody case.  This, firstly, reliably protects the phone in the event of a fall, and secondly, such a monolithic gadget is much nicer to take in hand than the slightly desperate first Desire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/726/872/536/726872536f46767e79f93c193877753e.jpg" alt="image">

      And in the hand of a new gadget is, perhaps, even better than the previous model.  Its length has decreased by half a centimeter, and everything else (width, thickness, display diagonal, etc.) remains the same. <br><br><h4>  Buttons </h4><br>  Buttons in the classic understanding of this word are two times and miscalculate!  One - as always, on top - to turn on and lock, the second (dual) - on the left side to adjust the volume.  At the same time, there is a feeling that the ‚ÄúOn‚Äù button is too tight, and the rocker on the side - on the contrary, is too easily pressed.  Nine times out of ten, wanting to lock the device, I invariably pressed one of the volume keys with my ring finger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/572/811/afc/572811afc2b493940a9c9dd248584527.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, those keys that are under the display - touch.  I can not say that I am very pleased with these changes, but in general it is not so terrible, since there is still a slight vibration response.  Well, the concept would probably break, if the designers thought of leaving the hardware buttons, they wouldn't fit into the new design. <br><br><h4>  Connectors </h4><br>  There are only two connectors: a 3.5 mm audio output on the upper end and a micro USB input on the left side.  The latter is not covered by any stubs, which is why the pocket pile is always packed there.  But in my opinion, it‚Äôs better that you constantly hook the protective socket with your fingernail, which will eventually come off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f05/881/5aa/f058815aa8ba7af7fdfc2995a0cbaab6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  Unlike the screen of the first Desire, the 3.7-inch display of the Desire S is based on Super LCD technology, not AMOLED.  On the one hand, this is bad - power consumption is higher, and the color rendition is slightly worse, but on the other hand, such a matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot so expensive to produce, which ultimately makes the whole gadget cheaper.  In this case, the picture remains quite juicy, and in the sun fade very slightly.  In short, a good display.  At the level.  And yes, he now supports full multitouch! <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  The hardware stuffing has also evolved.  Desire S is built on the Qualcomm MSM 8255 platform, on which the recent flagship Desire HD was based.  The chipset includes a gigahertz ARM processor, 768 MB of RAM, a graphics chip Adreno 205 and 1.1 gigabytes of internal memory, which can be expanded with microSDHC cards.  At the same time, a 8 GB card is included - not bad at all! <br><br>  Subjectively, the phone practically doesn‚Äôt slow down: it keeps a lot of ‚Äúheavy‚Äù sites in memory at once, rolls in programs and almost any games (of course, there are some that are optimized strictly for two cores, and here only one).  But if you want some numbers in a vacuum, please - in the Quadrant benchmark, which I traditionally use to measure the performance of android phones, the gadget scored 1267 points.  This is almost as much as the recently recorded SE Xperia Arc (1381) and slightly less than Desire HD (1581). <br><br><h4>  Connection </h4><br>  In addition, a change in the chipset entails an increase in the speed of data transfer.  Desire S supports maximum speed in 3G networks up to 14.4 Mbit / s for reception and up to 5.76 Mbit / s for transmission.  Plus, the Wi-Fi module now supports the standard n, which is good news - the increase, let's say, when the movie is downloaded from the network storage, is really noticeable! <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  The quality of the photos that Desire S gives out pleased me, although there are more advanced solutions on the market.  First of all, I like the fact that the positive dynamics has improved, and the pictures taken with this model look much better than those obtained on other HTC smartphones.  In particular, the developers decided a bug with blurring the left part of the frame and greatly increased the rate of fire - autofocus is induced in a split second, and the shutter immediately descends. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b2/f1b/a02/5b2f1ba024a85be1f5375dec55523461.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But of course, as before, a photo on the monitor screen and on the mobile display are two big differences.  It is necessary to increase the frame, as its origin becomes noticeable - only the microscopes of mobile phones give such characteristic noises and artifacts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be9/6c1/f64/be96c1f64e8c3d0493b606ddea13a735.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">View photo in original resolution.</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/157/5c1/fa4/1575c1fa49a40c4f74ffd8f9bc3da516.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">View photo in original resolution.</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f67/504/f33/f67504f33de3cfe2e89a1e583c7833a4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">View photo in original resolution.</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff5/a75/4f1/ff5a754f1c043f98863e29f5d0fcd1df.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">View photo in original resolution.</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6b/0e0/400/b6b0e04009518093090fdcbd11c2fa0d.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">View photo in original resolution.</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d65/8c5/bf9/d658c5bf9a81f7bf6fd6ca012dc3da2e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">View photo in original resolution.</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/da6/605/19b/da660519b2155968c85c040274aa9d59.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">View photo in original resolution.</a></i> <br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  The smartphone is running the latest to date version of the OS Android 2.3 Gingerbread.  By tradition, the HTC Sense 2.1 interface is uniformly ‚Äúsmeared‚Äù on this ‚Äúgingerbread‚Äù.  Functionally, the latter practically does not differ from previous versions - it‚Äôs still the same old kind shell with one small innovation ‚Äî the cataloger at the bottom of the application menu. <br><br><h4>  Working hours </h4><br>  Pleased and work time.  In the <i>active</i> use mode, the smart quietly keeps 12 hours: from the moment of removal from charging in the morning, until the device returns to the shelf.  It means something like the following: several email accounts permanently enabled in push mode, GTalk, browser, about 15 minutes of calls a day, SMS, plus music and video on the way from work and back. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47f/f48/ab2/47ff48ab2626f8ca64ee0e89c4406609.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Competitor </h4><br>  To hell with marketers!  Forget that SE Xperia arc is the flagship, and HTC Desire S is no longer.  They are built on a single chipset, have similar performance and are officially in the same price category.  But in the online stores the first one can still be found for at least 22 thousand rubles, but the second one on the Web already sells for 15, although they ask 21990 for it in the company store. ! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/087/19a/43d/08719a43dd8609542e6ba16c4e6ea86c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the same time, SE is supported by a larger screen in combination with Sony's proprietary software technologies for image enhancement, and in favor of HTC by an unibody aluminum case and Sense shell, which personally pleases me more than what the Japanese-Swedish alliance offers . <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Desire S is in the terminology of car enthusiasts an excellent restyling of the previous model.  The appearance remained recognizable, productivity did not increase much, but the company smoothed those minor ‚Äúroughness‚Äù that were present in the usual Desire, making the gadget again relevant for the year ahead.
