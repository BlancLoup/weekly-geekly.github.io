And I wanted to read the mail and see the weather in the Internet, I also really wanted to read a book.  Rummaging in the network, set up IceWM, which worked quite decently on this equipment, started Firefox and mail <br><br>  This is how my fascination with fast and functional environments began, and not a year goes by that I don‚Äôt start something new.  Today I want to talk about <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">DWM</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition to working in DWM, there is little experience with awesome (complex config), xmonad (it's also not easy to set up the first minimum, the default config is quite simple), scrotwm ( <a href="https://opensource.conformal.com/fluxbb/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D324">don't like the concept of multi-monitor support</a> ).  From ‚Äúfast‚Äù environments, I worked with IceWM, Fluxbox for a long time. <br><br><h4>  Pros DWM - Speed.  Reliability.  Simplicity. </h4><br>  Having a minimum of binary dependencies and not using anything extraneous, even the absence of a configuration file readable during execution can be a plus: this increases the reliability of the system as a whole.

      The gain in speed of drawing and launching applications is really determined by eye.  There is a feeling that the computer ‚Äúflies‚Äù while on KDE the same computer at best ‚Äúfunctions normally‚Äù. <br><br>  As for simplicity, I want to say the following.  Perhaps this is extreme - editing the config in config.h, but learning Lua (as in awesome), or haskell (as in xmonad) is also an extreme: trying to build a normal one <br>  config using paste-paste in xmonad and awesome is a long and tedious thing, <br>  learn a new programming language all the more. <br><br>  In my opinion, of all the minimalist environments, DWM is one of the <strong>simplest</strong> window managers. <br>  It is a single binary file, without a configuration file and any launch options.  Configuration is done by editing the C language include file. <br><br>  At the same time, the default configuration works immediately: <br><ol><li>  tiling (modkey + t) and floating (Floating) modes (modkey + f) </li><li>  in tiling mode - increase / decrease in the number of clients of the master window (modkey + i, modkey + d) </li><li>  resizing areas (modkey + h, + l) </li><li>  and other standard features of tiling mededzherov. </li></ol><br><br>  T e <u>we have a minimum of the required</u> functionality of the tiling manager. <br><br>  Custom keys are easy to set up.  If it is a call to an external program, you must first define a variable with its call, and then call it.  Let's say that I redefined the sound adjustment keys: <br><br><pre> static const char * incr_sound [] = {"amixer", "set", "Master", "2dB +", NULL};
 static const char * decr_sound [] = {"amixer", "set", "Master", "2dB-", NULL};

 ...

 static Key keys [] = {
 ...
	 {0, XF86XK_AudioRaiseVolume, spawn, {.v = incr_sound}},
	 {0, XF86XK_AudioLowerVolume, spawn, {.v = decr_sound}},
</pre><br><br>  For quick launch of programs - I installed dmenu. <br><br><img src="http://www.habrastorage.com/images/dmenu.png"><br><br><pre> static const char * dmenucmd [] = {"dmenu_run", "-fn", font, "-nb", colors [0] [2], "-nf",
				   colors [0] [1], "-sb", colors [1] [2], "-sf", colors [0] [1], NULL};
 ...
 {Mod1Mask, XK_F2, spawn, {.v = dmenucmd}},
</pre><br><br><h4>  A little about my preferences and requirements for the environment </h4><br>  Working as a programmer involves several essential points in the configuration of the development environment. <br><br>  In general, of course, you can work in any environment and without changing the basic settings ... <br>  ... but then inevitable kilometers of mouse running on the table and often (subconscious) irritation from the boring, multiple performing of the same type of actions. <br><br>  The topic of intensifying work and improving the functionality of development tools is very broad. <br>  and touches on a lot of aspects and there are millions of possible configurations. <br><br>  I personally need the following (at least I don‚Äôt know how to work <br>  these features): <br><br><ul><li>  Hot Key quick opening of the most frequently used programs: text editor, terminal, browser: <i>configured as dmenu, modkey + S + Enter, modkey + c</i> </li><li>  Quick flip of these windows to the right / left, from the screen to the screen: configured as <i>modkey + o</i> </li><li>  Ability to run other programs, preferably with auto-prompts and without brakes (as, for example, in KDE with Alt + F2): <i>Alt + f2, Modkey + r</i> </li><li>  Starting programs at window manager start: <i>via .xinitrc</i> </li><li>  The output of the current date and time somewhere to be seen on the screen: <i>through xsetroot in a loop</i> </li><li>  sys tray - a place on the screen where there will be icons from all sorts of messengers such as Skype, network configuration, and so on: <i>external stalonetray program</i> </li><li>  a lot of desktops to have enough space to place all my working programs: <i>in the package</i> </li><li>  Russification: <i>xorg means</i> </li><li>  current indication of processor load (sysload): <i>your script + xsetroot</i> </li><li>  indication of battery discharge, current time: <i>your script + xsetroot</i> </li></ul><br><br><h4>  What is tiling-wm </h4><br>  More details can be found here: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager</a> <br><br>  For me personally, I will briefly formulate: <i>Tiling is when you don‚Äôt have to look for a hidden window when there are a large number of them</i> , or when you don‚Äôt have to waste time dragging windows to it.  Management of applications and their location on the screen occurs mainly from the keyboard.  No need to press Alt + Tab for a long time - all windows are visible. <br><br>  To amuse you I will tell the recent story about the "visibility of windows". <br>  I worked in KDE ... I have two monica - the one on the laptop and the one on the table. <br>  Working in Skype + Tmux remote session with a colleague, I accidentally somehow did not move the window and then: __ could not find it __!? <br><br>  I already had this in KDE when moving the window it ‚Äúfell through‚Äù to the neighboring desktop, but I didn‚Äôt find one after that! <br><br>  In general, the situation was strange, we had to interrupt our rally, since we almost discussed everything.  And what about the window?  It was found.  Accidentally ... After ~ 2 hours, I found it in the ‚Äúinvisible‚Äù area between the monitors, which was formed by the fact that the monitors are of different sizes and the virtual screen in KDE is rectangular.  It rolled shorter in the lower right corner, there is a ‚Äúdead‚Äù zone of 432 pixels in height.  Here is such a story. <br><br>  Moral: this would never have happened in Tiling mode since all windows are visible. <br><br><h5>  Specificity: </h5><br>  DWM is a minimalistic WM, while providing everything I need for successful and productive work. <br><br><ol><li>  10 pre-configured workspaces using modkey + n buttons </li><li>  3 modes - tiling, floating, monocle </li><li>  full window title </li><li>  battery charge indication, date + time, sysload </li><li>  work in tiling mode: opening new windows, sizes of areas, increase / decrease in the number of wizard clients </li><li>  setting the floating and location for certain applications.  gimp as an example. </li><li>  dmenu - fast dynamic menu </li><li>  my scripts - display configuration, sleep, set-desktop-wallpaper </li></ol><br><br>  For items 1-8, see my video.  I deliberately drove the monitor into a mode with a lower resolution so that it could be clearly seen on small monitors: <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0iKB4Pgl4g%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj9sEBZw5yb_AWlWAl1KNETvAdWoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Cons &amp; Flaws: </h4><br><ul><li> I think that the default configuration should be convenient for everyone.  why by default <br>  switching mode (modkey-t, modkey-f) happens to all desktops to me is incomprehensible: <br>  it is not comfortable.  I had to put a patch: <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag">dwm.suckless.org/patches/pertag</a> </li><li>  My program for setting the date and mn in the toolbar sometimes loses connection with <br>  X server.  I don‚Äôt know if DWM is to blame or if I have some problems with xorg. <br>  I had to enter a restart cycle. </li><li>  all the same lack of config and restart annoying.  I think that for C language <br>  This is an easy task to parse the name / value file.  Loop change config.h <br>  the compilation had to go through 50 times until I completed everything I needed. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br><br>  Perhaps for many, the DWM will be too minimal for everyday work.  But I can recommend one thing - having installed once and adjusting it for yourself, DWM will be a very reliable assistant in situations where KDE or something else refuses to work correctly (the long and dreary package rebuilding in Gentoo is the most vivid example of such force majeure). <br><br><h4>  External links </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">DWM website</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://codepad.org/epQFpDHA">My config.h, consider what costs pertag and statuscolor patches</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136533/</a></p>
