Hackers dramatically improved their skills and capabilities, increasing the number of threats and making them much more complex, and new techniques allow threats to go unnoticed in corporate networks for a longer period of time than before. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The task of protecting an enterprise is a difficult task, because in the corporate network of an enterprise there may be hundreds and even thousands of computers, and an attacker can only crack one of them in order to carry out his malicious actions and achieve success.  Security solutions makers have been around for decades and are constantly improving their products to protect computers from malicious infections.

      At first it was quite simple, because  the number of threats was small, and therefore it was enough to identify all the threats to ensure the safety of computers.  True, some of those threats were quite complex and were a ‚Äúnightmare‚Äù for anti-virus companies, because professionals and experts had to spend several days or even weeks to create a signature for their detection.  The creators of such viruses were the people who tried to show their outstanding capabilities and talents - this was the only reason that prompted them to create malicious "creations". <br><br>  As the Internet grew, another motive appeared: money.  As soon as cyber-criminals realized how to take financial advantage of computer attacks, everything changed dramatically - now virus scanning is becoming a professional and dynamically developing business.  Now manufacturers of security solutions had to make adjustments again. <br><br>  Volumes of creating new threats are growing exponentially.  In the old days, the virus could ‚Äútravel‚Äù for weeks or even months from Los Angeles to New York.  Now, in seconds, the virus can spread from Washington to Tokyo. <br><br>  Traditional anti-virus approaches are essentially based on traditional black and white lists.  For a long time, such approaches worked quite efficiently, but in the era of modern threats, they should not be relied on anymore.  Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãcriminals may try millions of times and fail to achieve a positive result, but once they succeed, they win and achieve impressive results.  These are not equal conditions, and security solutions must constantly evolve in order not only to keep up, but also to go a step ahead. <br><br>  Fighting hackers is a tough battle for security solution makers, but we know what needs to be done to combat the most complex and unknown cyber attacks.  Now it‚Äôs just a matter of implementation, but for this, enterprises must understand how important information security is to them in order to achieve their business goals. <br><br>  Below is a webinar recording dated September 7, 2017, which was conducted by Luis Corrons, Technical Director of the PandaLabs antivirus laboratory of Panda Security. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W3kVxJ3qrRQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>PS Webinar in English (for your convenience, you can turn on subtitles).</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/337452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/337452/</a></p>
