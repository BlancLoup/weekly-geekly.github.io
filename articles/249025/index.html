  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Announcement of the JPoint 2015 Java Conference</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><blockquote>  <i>Make your program taking into account that the information field of the Earth depends on it.</i> <br>  Nikita Dzhigurda <br></blockquote><br>  Literally in three months, on April 20, in <s>the World Trade Center</s> Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel in Moscow we will hold the third Java conference of the <b>JPoint</b> .  The first JPoint conference was a unique event for Russia in the sense that it was completely independent from vendors.  The second one last year distinguished itself by being pretty hardcore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23c/35f/ea9/23c35fea9a804cfe9008b1a372c03bad.png"><br><br>  What does the JPoint 2015 prepare for us?  Details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Classics of the genre</b> <br>  I'll start with the main thing.  First, the JPoint 2015 will continue to be an <b>independent</b> and <b>hardcore</b> Java conference.  Personally, I (at the level of the worldview) are alien to the trends that now dominate IT events: startups, 20-minute reports, hackathons, etc. Therefore, this is not all about us.  We are conservative, and it turns out that in this hardcore and conservative approach they are rather unique.  What successfully and exploit.  The more around hackathons, lightning interpretations, ‚Äúall-around‚Äù conferences and other various funny things, the more confident we feel.  We are not fashionable?  Okay, we will return to the classic style! 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Secondly, the JPoint 2015 will be a <b>classic</b> in form professional conference precisely in the sense in which we are accustomed to perceive this word.  If you look in detail, we will have 3 or 4 streams, 6 reports each.  Duration of the report - 40-50 minutes.  Mid day lunch time.  It is worth noting that meals at the WTC are expensive, so we introduced a special ‚Äúunforgettable‚Äù category of tickets for those who like to save money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc4/c8c/2a2/bc4c8c2a2aeb44b683760c3c390a8444.png"><br><br>  Thirdly, the JPoint 2015 will be even <b>bigger</b> .  This year we plan to gather <b>more than a thousand</b> Russian-speaking Java-specialists from Russia and neighboring countries.  We plan to significantly expand the booth area, involving not only companies looking for employees or selling products for Java developers, but also others to participate in the exhibition.  In particular, following the example of Highload ++, we will organize stands with experts.  In this zone, everyone will be able to talk with speakers and other experts on the hottest topics: Java 9, Performance, Spring, ORM, Java EE, etc. On the same topics we will hold a series of round tables, which will be held in a separate room at the same time reports. <br><br><h5>  Speakers </h5><br>  We will do our best to keep for you the best speakers of the JPoint 2014, while adding a few new faces to it.  At the moment we <a href="http://javapoint.ru/talks/">announced</a> 5 reports: <br><ul><li>  <b>Alexei Shipilev</b> from Oracle Java Performance Team will talk about java.lang.String internals.  (English version of this report from Joker: <b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DYgGAUGC9ksk">tyts</a></b> ) </li><li>  <b>Sergey Kuksenko</b> from the same team will make an updated report on hardware counters - a tool that allows you to answer the <s>eternal Russian</s> question ‚Äúwhat to do?‚Äù In case you have a CPU Load = 100% </li><li>  <b>Andrei Pangin</b> from Odnoklassniki will tell a modified version of his report on debugging tools (keywords: JVMTI, Dynamic Attach Mechanism, Serviceability Agent, Instrumentation API).  This will be a repeat of the report with Joker, so that those who have already seen this report in St. Petersburg will be able to go to other halls with a clear conscience. </li><li>  <b>Jacob Sirotkin</b> , legend, leader and founder of the first JUG.ru, will talk about rewriting PL / SQL hell in Java </li><li>  <b>Anton Arkhipov</b> , our good friend from the Tallinn-based company ZeroTurnaround (JRebel, XRebel), will talk about the modification of bytecode. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/191/405/bef/191405befbf441569091c18db586db5b.png"><br><br>  Other best speakers of the JPoint 2014 have already confirmed their participation. In particular, <b>Nikolai Alimenkov</b> from Kiev chooses between topics about messaging and testing, <b>Gleb Smirnov</b> (now from Tartu!) Thinks about what else can be done with hotspot, and <b>Baruch Sadogursky</b> and <b>Eugene Borisov</b> from Israel are preparing the second part of Groovy Puzzlers, a <b>continuation of</b> their excellent report from the October Joker: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/SBVaXHT5EW0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhpNQ9a4blCf9aXsFjBr8WFnICHlg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  New faces </h5><br>  Of those we seriously consider as speakers, I would like to specifically mention <b>Roma Leventov</b> from Higher Frequence Trading, the master of quick collections (Koloboke, OpenHFT) and a colleague of the famous Peter Laurie, as well as everyone in Academgorodok <b>Max Ivanov</b> , who recently moved to Kaliningrad .  Roma is preparing to talk about in-memory key-value stores, and Max plans to do some retrospective of enterprise technologies. <br><br><h5>  We need your report! </h5><br>  The conference is a living organism.  For its development and growth, we are actively looking for new topics, new faces and new ideas.  The key feature of the JPoint 2015 is, of course, its program.  Unlike the same <a href="http://cfp.devoxx.be/2014/agenda/conf/wednesday">Devoxx</a> , <a href="http://rigadevday.lv/">RigaDevDay</a> and our good friends <a href="http://jeeconf.com/program/">JEEConf</a> , we do not want to increase by adding reports to it ‚Äúon neighboring topics‚Äù: topics about Javascript, Android or BigData can appear in our program only if they are directly connected with java  We understand that for many of you, these topics are interesting even apart from Java, but what to do. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Minute of philosophy</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  It is for this reason that I made a quote from Dzhigurda <s>(oh my God, did I really write this?)</s> In the epigraph.  We want to make a great program for this conference, and at the same time remain focused on Java.  As I wrote above, this path seems to many dangerous, because we are moving against the trend.  Trend - this is the information field of the earth, this is what puts pressure on us outside.  And we really do not like being pressured.  And it is through the breaking of the trend and the return to the sources that we will change this very information field. <br></div></div><br>  If you want to become a speaker, if you have something to say ‚Äî just fill out the appropriate <a href="http://javapoint.ru/becomespeaker/">form on the site</a> .  We will contact you within a few hours.  We accept applications until February 20, that is, you have only 3 weeks to formulate the topic and plan your speech.  Do not pull! <br><br><h5>  Links </h5><br>  Once again, all related links: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://javapoint.ru/%3Futm_refcode%3Dbf883f6a2688e415d5323e6ae01602efed5ff922">Conference site</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://javapoint.ru/becomespeaker%3Futm_refcode%3Dbf883f6a2688e415d5323e6ae01602efed5ff922">Become a speaker</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://2014.javapoint.ru/%3Futm_refcode%3Dbf883f6a2688e415d5323e6ae01602efed5ff922">Materials last year's conference</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  Tickets are on sale now.  For those who are not able to come to Moscow on April 20, but do not want to wait several months until the conference materials become public, the option of buying an <b>online broadcast is available</b> . <br><br>  And the last for today.  We want to make the JPoint 2015 conference a worldwide conference.  In order to fulfill this dream, we ask you to write in the comments below your wishes on the topics of presentations and speakers that you want to see at the conference.  See you at the JPoint! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/249025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/249025/</a></p>
