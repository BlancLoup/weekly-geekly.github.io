But first things first. <br><br>  <b>Characteristics and debriefing</b> <br><br>  Apple TV 3-gen runs on a dual-core A5 processor (32 nm), but one of its cores is software disabled.  For what it is done, I did not find out, but I can say with confidence that even one core copes with the playback of Full HD video.  Graphics chip: PowerVR SGX 543MP2. <br><br><img src="http://rozetked.ru/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Apple-A5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>(Apple A5 on iPhone 4S and Apple TV 3)</i> <br><br>  Note: iPhone 4S and iPad 2 (released before 2012) have Apple A5 installed using 45nm technology, which allows the device to discharge the battery 15% faster than the same 32nm chip. <br><br>  In addition, Apple TV is set to 512 MB of RAM and 8 GB of internal memory, which can not be used.  Internal memory is intended only for system processes and caching. <br><br>  <b>AirPlay, iTunes Match, iCloud</b> <br><br>  If you still do not know what AirPlay is, then I will pleasantly surprise you.  This function in real-time mode allows you to stream an image from an iPhone, iPod touch, iPad, Mac or PC to a TV or monitor ... not without the help of Apple TV, of course.  The most pleasant thing here is that this technology is brought to mind and the image does not slow down a bit.  Here another question may arise: what is it for?  Firstly, Mirroring allows you to play games with the iPhone on the big screen, and this is a great pleasure.  Secondly, you can listen to music or watch movies.  In general, the thing is extremely useful and in my opinion it is the dominant feature in the ‚Äúusefulness‚Äù of Apple TV.  [ <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/AirPlay">WTF?</a>  ] <br><br>  The iTunes Match feature is also quite good, but I could not understand its essence until the moment of release.  Bought - understood.  Simply put, the entire ‚Äúpirated‚Äù music library that is on your PC or Mac is processed via iCloud, where you can ‚Äî it is replaced with AAC 256 Kbps, and as a result it becomes (as it were) licensed.  Therefore, it can be safely used through Apple TV, without making a ‚Äúsharing‚Äù of the so-called home collection, which would require a PC or Mac. <br><br>  With iOS 5.2, Apple TV received another function - listening to music purchased from the iTunes Store.  Conveniently. <br><br>  <b>Formats and purchases</b> <br><br>  Apple has always stood out among other companies, and from an ordinary media center, it made Apple TV, which can not read flash drives, hard drives, and in general play many formats.  To watch a movie, buy it, or at least download it in MP4 format (H.264) in the iTunes collection, and from there look on AirPlay. <br><br>  It seems long and uncomfortable, but in fact not. <br><br>  First, buying and watching movies is great (I can say the same about music on the iTunes Store, where Pink Floyd's discography was bought up in the first days of the opening).  This is great for two reasons: firstly, the tribute to the creators and secondly, it is convenient.  The question is controversial, and even someone will spit in karma, but I insist. <br><br>  As for other formats, there is a way out here: using the same Windows and AirPlay, you can arrange a Mirrorring for the entire screen area and open absolutely any, up to each line of code, pirated file through any player you like. <br><br>  By the way, the program that allows ‚Äúto arrange everything‚Äù is called AirParrot and costs as much as $ 10, as well as the Wi-Fi card in the PC.  But I know that you already went to Pirate Bay.  [ <a href="http://airparrot.com/">link</a> ] <br><br>  <b>Apple remote</b> <br><br><img src="http://rozetked.ru/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/hero4_201108261.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another thoughtful Apple thing - an application for iOS-devices.  Using the Remote [ <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/app/remote/id284417350%3Fmt%3D8">iTunes link</a> ], you can fully control the Apple TV using the keyboard (and not touch through the letter using the standard "toggle"). <br><br>  By the way, Apple TV supports native BT-keyboard from Apple players, and this provides the latest iOS update with the number 5.2. <br><br>  Included with the Apple TV is also a remote.  He is incredibly beautiful, as it seems to me and has nothing superfluous.  The only problem I encountered was simultaneous work with a MacBook.  I switch the song to Apple TV - I increase the sound on the MacBook.  Long thought how to turn it off on the computer and found.  In the settings of OS X, enter "Remote" and in the appeared variant you will find the salvation: <br><br><img src="http://rozetked.ru/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Snimok-e`krana-2013-03-01-v-15.20.21.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Conclusions, pros and cons</b> <br><br>  In Apple TV, I love the small size, I like the unique and sometimes irreplaceable function of AirPlay, I like the relatively cheap rent and purchase of movies, and, of course, the built-in Internet radio, YouTube and Vimeo.  I don‚Äôt like the fact that there is no built-in application store here, which, I think, would have sold Apple TV several times, because now developers of applications and games have a lot of ideas. <br><br>  Buy or not?  If you don‚Äôt feel sorry for 50-100 rubles for one movie viewing in front of the TV, if you don‚Äôt chase after novelties and are ready to wait for a movie with a good dubbing ... if the AirPlay function is exciting, yes, that‚Äôs what you need.  The rest can pass by. <br><br>  <b>Ps</b> .  <i>Habravchane friends, the best thanks for the article are pluses in karma.</i> <br><br>  <b>Update</b> : a great article from your point of view, 2009 [ <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/51732/">Habralink</a> ] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171259/</a></p>
