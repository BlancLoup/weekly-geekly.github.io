The organizer, as follows from the title, was made by the notorious Intel company.  The meeting was held in the Free Workshop co-working. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/116/8b9/704/1168b97044144c6f9abace82120e2f48.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The program of the event was: <br><ul><li>  Introduction: About the Intel Developer Zone for IoT developers.  Svetlana Emelyanova </li><li>  Presentation of Intel's SoC solutions, namely: Galileo Gen2 and Intel Edison.  Roman Khatko. </li><li>  Experience with boards and projects.  Diana Ilyina, Sergey Ivanov. </li><li>  Demonstration of projects. </li></ul><br>  By 18:00, people interested in the topic of IoT were drawn up. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">In a nutshell about IoT</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>IoT (Internet of the things) is a relatively recent term that distinguishes a class of devices connected to a common network, able to communicate between themselves and third-party services, including globally.</i>  <i>In the future, such a mechanism allows to automate a number of daily routine tasks, which makes life comfortable and increases the efficiency of modern computing technologies.</i> </div></div><br>  "Free Workshop" is located in the street.  Christmas, the event was held in the attic room, easily accommodated the visitors.  To demonstrate the projects, a table, a projector and a presentation board were provided. <br>  The participants were given everything they needed: a notebook, a badge and a special, ‚Äúnot simple‚Äù, pen with a stylus embedded in the butt for capacitive screens.

The important point is the absence of the need for a SPI connection with a microSD card reader or, for example, with an Ethernet interface - it is enough to use the <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/SD">appropriate</a> <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Ethernet">libraries</a> . <br>  A special version of the Arduino IDE is available for coding. <br>  The system can work with Linux, RTOS <a href="https://support.windriver.com/formakers/">VxWorks,</a> and <a href="http://dev.windows.com/en-us/featured/Windows-Developer-Program-for-IoT">even Windows 10</a> . <br>  Intel Edison is quite the size of a matchbox, only thin.  With its mini size it has rich wireless capabilities and energy saving solutions.  At the development stage, the board can join the developer equipment and, thus, have similar Galileo peripheral capabilities. <br><br>  The speech turned out to be lively because of the many questions to the novel.  Indeed, devices have both strengths and shortcomings. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About possible prerequisites for Intel Galileo / Edison release</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>Indeed - there are a number of questions about the feasibility of such Intel Galileo and Intel Edison hardware.</i>  <i>In terms of performance, Quarks lose to the Raspberry Pi CPU, while costing more.</i>  <i>There is no friendly GPU and Audio on the board.</i>  <i>Because of the i586 + architecture, there are difficulties with installing common Linux distributions and running software from under them.</i>  <i>Arduino emulation, though faster than on real Arduino, but still not fully compatible.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>However, experts are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/236743/">finding the benefits of</a> this step by Intel in the unique capabilities of developing their own components in the implementation of the UEFI BIOS.</i> </div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31c/524/bf2/31c524bf20514f0899d1ea0ea015d669.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The employees of the <a href="http://wl.unn.ru/">Laboratory of the BSF</a> , Diana Ilyina and Sergey Ivanov told about their experience with Intel motherboards.  The guys used alternative linux distributions for Galileo and Intel Edison boards (Intel recommends using Yocto Poky Linux).  The use of boards in practice also has a number of nuances. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61f/d20/5dd/61fd205ddc814c2cb8659534406e0fa6.jpg" alt="Diana Ilyina and Sergey Ivanov. Laboratory of Physical Fundamentals and Wireless Communication Technologies of the Radiophysical Faculty of the UNN"><br><br>  In the second part of the mitap, projects were presented. <br><br>  A device designed to sync photos to the cloud is made on Intel Galileo. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">On the implementation of cloud technologies in IoT</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>Cloud technology is closely related to IoT.</i>  <i>Intel provides a dedicated cloud system that has the resources to store and analyze data.</i>  <i>Using this service, Intel Galileo / Edison device developers get a quick start in data processing without additional storage and computing power.</i>  <i>( <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-iot-developer-kit-cloud-based-analytics-user-guide">source</a> )</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Meanwhile, Galileo implements messaging functionality between devices and a <a href="https://meshcentral.com/">third-party service</a> - downloading sketches from the cloud and managing them via a web interface ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/212991/">source</a> ).</i> </div></div><br>  An sd card is inserted into the device - and then, via wifi, the photos are sent to the cloud.  The author announced the functionality of creating geotagging in accordance with the place of loading photos.  The stated period of work from a full charge cycle is 30 hours. <br><br>  The developer noted that geotags are capable of putting down the cameras themselves (at the time of the shutter release), however, at the moment, there are not so many models capable of this, and they belong to the higher price range.  Thus, the device provides functionality that is likely to be built into future serial photo equipment. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Note on wifi sync</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>The wifi sync niche is already being mastered by manufacturers - many new camera models have a built-in wifi module with which you can organize photo synchronization to a mobile device (smartphone / tablet) - and then to the cloud.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>According to the author of the project, the market already offers <a href="http://fi.transcend-info.com/Support/No-401">alternatives to</a> this device made in the form of an sd memory card.</i> </div></div><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f20/3c6/5be/f203c65be8c8472ca016c2398c65e7c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The second number in the list of projects was represented by a "smart closet" (based on Intel Edison) with a controlled clothes hanger, put forward by the team, drawers and an additional control interface - voice!  The device is also controlled from a smartphone via web applications.  In the future, the creators promise that the wardrobe will be able to offer clothing options that, in their opinion, will be harmoniously combined with each other and meet the latest fashion trends. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Voice Interface Note</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>An interesting observation about voice control in principle - for clearer recognition, maximum clarity in pronunciation is necessary.</i>  <i>Operators of such interfaces, in theory, should pre-train articulation like a television and radio presenter.</i>  <i>Knowledge of the language of management is also important.</i> </div></div><br>  The cabinet undoubtedly needs additional usability, but it seems convenient to be used by people with physical limitations (for example, wheelchair users). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eae/2f1/28d/eae2f128d81e413bb80699f97ebd9fe5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The following presentation of the device (based on Intel Galileo Gen1), which controls an unusual LED panel.  The LEDs are located in a cellular structure made of 3mm foam board.  According to the creators, this panel is designed for placement in rooms in order to create an aesthetic effect.  One of the functions demonstrated by the authors during the presentation of the project was tetris with control through a web application.  In the dark, the panel looks especially impressive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc1/da5/036/cc1da50365534581bd1c3d961087ee14.jpg" alt="LED panel design on Intel Galileo Gen1"><br><br>  In conclusion, Artyom Poptsov touched upon the highlights of the development of high-tech communities on the example of hackerspaces already existing in Russia and, in particular, on the example of Nizhny Novgorod CADR.  CADR participants design devices similar to the IoT concept and are interested in a deeper understanding of it.  The transfer of the Intel Galileo Gen2 and Intel Edison instances to the hackerspace from the organizers was a pleasant moment. <br><br>  photo - Nikolai Smolin, text - Nikolai Smolin and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/gymlyg/" class="user_link">gymlyg</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251423/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251423/</a></p>
