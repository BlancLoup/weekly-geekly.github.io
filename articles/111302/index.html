  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We accept calls from a mobile phone on the air of a student radio station</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I was able to participate in the development of a student radio station that was broadcast over a local network.  The radio station developed with its successes and failures, good music played, greetings were transmitted through the form on the site, but something was missing.  And there was not enough two-way communication with the audience.  It was necessary to somehow implement the dial in the studio.  During the brainstorming, 2 ways were invented.  Under their implementation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Googling the Internet, several settings were found for receiving via Skype, as well as via dialup modem to the telephone line.  Since the radio is student, and the ‚Äúheadquarters‚Äù was in the dormitory, there is no wired phone, the number of professional equipment tends to zero, and the Internet was only on traffic. <br><br>  It was necessary to set up a broadcast radio + phone, having an old computer with one sound card, microphone, speakers and mobile phone. <br><br>  The first idea that arose is to tear the headset from the phone, and put the sound on the line input.  And RJ had to talk in the studio microphone and headset microphone.  I didn‚Äôt want to spoil the headset, I didn‚Äôt have a soldering iron at hand, and the signal was rather weak for a line input, I needed a preamplifier.  This option immediately disappeared.

      Then I remembered that my SE W610i phone has a fairly functional Bluetooth version 2.0 and maybe 2.1.  Which allows you to connect it to a computer, and use a Bluetooth headset as a stereo. <br>  A Bluetooth version 2.1 adapter with A2DP profile support was purchased at the nearest store.  There were no drivers included.  By connecting the coveted adapter, windows 7 installed its drivers.  And it seems like everything works, but did not want to connect the computer.  And all because the standard drivers do not support A2DP profile.  The search began for a normal driver, which did not last for one hour.  When the explorer connected the phone, it fell, then the phone gave out - a connection error, but in the end a working version was found. <br><br>  It remains the case for small, set it all up. <br><br><h4>  Customization </h4><br>  Having paired the computer with the phone via Bluetooth, and having made a test call, I found out that the interlocutor's speech comes to the PC sound device marked by default, respectively, the sound from the microphone (default) was transmitted to the interlocutor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/de/c8/dec80a13f424d59d25315e44c6dd4236.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For broadcasting radio on the network, SAM Broadcaster was used in narrow circles.  It was necessary to realize the possibility of communicating with the listener, both on the air and outside (to tell about receiving prizes and behavior on the air).  SAM Broadcaster has the ability to capture sound for the microphone from only one source.  This prompted the idea that all the "sounds" need to be collected in one.  Those.  RJ's speech and listener speech on one line. <br><br>  Virtual wires were used to set up routing, in particular, Virtual Audio Cable.  The program must add 3 standard cables. <br><br>  Line 1 -&gt; the voice of the caller <br>  Line 2 -&gt; rj voice from studio microphone <br>  Line 3 -&gt; Sum of Line 1 and Line 2 <br><br>  It is necessary to note an important point, which somehow does not immediately reach.  Adding one virtual cable, it appears in playback devices and recording devices.  When we redirect the sound from the microphone to Line 2 as a recorder, it can only be removed from the same Line 2 as a playback device.  This is very useful when a program sees only recording devices, and you need to capture the sound that comes from the speakers (i.e. via DirectSound).  To do this, you only need to redirect the sound from the speakers to Line 1, for example, and in the recording program, select Line 1. <br><br>  Continue setting.  Now you need to run 4 pieces of Audio Repeater'a, which is installed along with Virtual Audio Cable.  And set up as follows: <br><br>  Microphone -&gt; Line2 <br>  Line 1 -&gt; Speakers (so that rj can be heard in the headphones, what the caller says) <br>  Line 2 -&gt; Line 3 <br>  Line 1 -&gt; Line 3 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/dc/4c/dc4c29c8571cd3910e933b8c84398343.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Now you need to configure Windows 7 (Control Panel -&gt; Sound). <br><br>  1. Make Line 1 the default playback device; <br>  2. Line 2 - default recording device. <br><br>  It should turn out like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e2/31/e2315c93c53a824ba6308dee8efdb75c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And last, it remains to configure SAM Broadcaster.  In the Voice FX window, click Config.  In Voice FX destination, select Mixer, and in Record soundcard device, select Line 3. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c7/bb/c7bb1dd08148a694ec9c228a09fb4196.png" alt="image"><br><br>  That's all.  This scheme allows you to pick up the phone and communicate off the air while the music is playing.  As soon as RJ presses the Mic ON button (the music is muted automatically), his voice and the caller‚Äôs voice go on the air.  The caller hears only the voice of RJ'ya without music in the background.  And all this in the absence of wires. <br><br>  I hope this is a small how to give a new stage in the development of your small network radio station.  Good and sociable listeners to you!  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111302/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111302/</a></p>
