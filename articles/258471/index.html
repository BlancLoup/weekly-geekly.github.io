Not everything about what he wrote and wanted to write fit into the ‚ÄúElectronics for beginners‚Äù framework, even the universal ‚Äúdevelopment‚Äù hub did not help.  Perhaps it‚Äôs not just me that I‚Äôm familiar with the feeling that after you publish you don‚Äôt sleep at midnight and you think you won‚Äôt be banned from your article along with your account for breaking the rules of the community. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now all this is in the past, my more than annual efforts were finally crowned with success and the <b>respected administration of</b> this resource finally reacted with understanding to my next letter.  Yesterday we had a separate hub, in which from now on, they will be able to publish their circuit design articles, tracers and just radio amateurs. <br><br>  The site administrators have already done a great job and mark them with a large number of articles that dealt with circuit engineering in some way, for which they are particularly thankful.  Having subscribed to the hub, now it will be much easier to search for them, so when publishing your new interesting material on this subject, do not forget about its existence.

    <h4>  PS This is an addition that appeared here in response to comments from users of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/ivan_83/" class="user_link">Ivan_83</a> , <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/calc/" class="user_link">Calc</a> and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/oberon87/" class="user_link">oberon87</a> </h4><br>  In my opinion, this resource is not an academic journal.  It is aimed at a wide range of readers in the first place, and not at highbrow professionals. <br>  Moreover, I say, I have repeatedly come across the fact that people who are supercooled in FPGA when developing real devices that you want to do not want have an analog component that led the project to a standstill.  Personally, I had a case when I was invited to urgently pull one project. <br>  I think, for example, articles on the basics of tracing will be met here with a bang.  Thanks to the internet of things, a lot of people have become interested in electronics lately.  Now they are at the level when they buy arduino and wire it to the Chinese bluetooth, download the software pattern and flash the LED. <br>  Sooner or later they will want to do something more serious of their own, and the basics of circuit engineering and tracing will be useful to them.  I hope that this hub will help at least a little to raise a falling engineering culture.  It's not scary to write about elementary things from the point of professionals, especially if you do it without lifting your nose.  Personally, I try to track comments on each of my articles and make additions and corrections in it based on the information received.  As a result, the article only gets better and more interesting. <br>  When I was in school, a boxing teacher in our section of adolescents, an international class master of sports, put into my head - a real professional is not the one who organizes nothing but a wall to wall fight with the next quarter and breaks five jaws in her jaws, and the one who transfers his experience to the weaker and comes to the aid of the needy.  These pros are not snobs and do not look with a sense of superiority to the whole world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258471/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258471/</a></p>
