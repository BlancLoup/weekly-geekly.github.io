  <section class="page js-page"><h1>E-mail communication culture</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Much in life is learned only at work and with real tasks. <br>  At school and in the institute, many of us were taught a culture of communication, writing, table behavior, telephone conversations, or behavior in the presence of women.  There is in our life today another form factor of communication between people - this is e-mail. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I often notice the complete lack of a culture of communication by e-mail in almost all segments of the population.  I constantly have to correspond by e-mail with many people: from students to grandmothers-accountants, from full teapots to the most experienced IT specialists of the largest companies.  Not many of my acquaintances can really make an e-mail or conduct business correspondence. <br><br>  Under the cut are a few simple rules that will help you culturally communicate via e-mail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>Your nickname"</strong>

      Many people use for communication not corporate, but personal mail (look at the <a href="http://gumoza.ru/iTips/34">results of my analysis of mail usage by accountants</a> ).  Very often, people use personal mail when applying for a job.  Take a close look at your ‚Äúnickname‚Äù - it should be a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù word.  Very often, many more at a school-institute have made a name for themselves like tanechka-lastochka @ or worse than zubastik23 @ and use it to this day.  Best of all, if your "nickname" will reflect your name and surname.  The exception is difficult to write in English names and surnames - in this case, you need to creatively approach the issue.  Good example of ‚Äúnick‚Äù: zhukovau@ya.ru or frolkin.kirill@gmail.com <br><br>  <strong>Your name</strong> <br><br>  If you use personal mail for business correspondence with customers and partners in your account settings, it is important to set your Name and Surname correctly, for example, the mail account holder at frolkin.kirill@gmail.com should be recorded as Frolkin Kirill, not ‚ÄúKirill F‚Äù or ‚Äú frolkin kirill.  Many people do not understand why we need these settings - when your interlocutor receives a letter - he sees your ‚Äúkiril FF‚Äù in the field from whom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c7f/618/eae/c7f618eae5b26d669251a19ba4f34875.png"><br><br>  A good form is the description of your full name in Russian, without forgetting about the register.  English spelling is acceptable only if you often correspond with foreigners. <br><br>  I had a rather ridiculous case when communicating with the chief accountant of one company, which was called Vlaimir Vladimirovich, and in the field of his full name he stood: ‚ÄúKhristenko Lyubov Gennadyevna‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>Signature</strong> <br><br>  It is necessary to properly form your signature.  This is also done in the mail settings.  The main requirement for the signature: your interlocutor must understand with whom he communicates, and what are the possible means of communication with you. <br><br>  An example of a successful signature: <br><blockquote>  We hope for mutually beneficial and long-term cooperation! <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Head of Sales <br>  ITR Companies <br>  Zhukov Andrey Yuryevich <br>  zhukov@referent.ru <br>  (495) 781-49-44 <br>  8 903 774-32-07 </blockquote><br>  Example of a bad signature: <br><blockquote>  <font color="#888888">Hall of Fame: see the best on Yandex. Photos <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/hall-of-fame/">http://fotki.yandex.ru/hall-of-fame/</a></font> </blockquote><br>  <strong>Letter subject - WHAT do you want</strong> <br><br>  If you want the letter to be read, state the subject of the letter correctly.  In the header of your email should be a short phrase that will make the person (addressee) be sure to read your letter.  This method is best used by spammers - their main task is to name the subject of the letter so that you at least take a look at the text.  If you write to a person who does not expect a letter from you, be sure to indicate in the title of his full name, for example: ‚ÄúN.E. Gantry  |  from the company ITR ", so your addressee will not confuse the letter with SPAM (after all, the main trouble of SPAMMERS is that they don‚Äôt know the name of the person they are writing to).  If you are not writing the first message to a person or are in constant correspondence with him - indicate the topic you are discussing (specifying the name is no longer critical), for example, ‚Äúfor Natalia from the ITR Company on the harmonization of the Agreement‚Äù <br>  or ‚Äúthe name and password of the DELTA system until September 19, 2008‚Äù. <br><br>  <strong>Reply to the letter (Reply)</strong> <br><br>  When you have written a letter that requires an answer from your side, you must use the reply function, and not create a new letter.  This is a seemingly commonplace rule that many people forget to follow when they respond to a letter some time after they have read it.  Always use the search to find the incoming letter, and only then reply to it.  This is extremely important, because  your interlocutor will understand which letter you are responding to. <br>  The same applies to the Forward function, when you forward a letter from one person to another. <br><br>  There are two options for answering a letter: when your answer is above the old text and when your answer is below the old text.  In my opinion it is correct to use the first option, since  The main task of the letter is to convey your answer, and even the history of correspondence can be read from below.  Sometimes you have to give an answer directly in the text of the letter, when it contains many points, it is not very beautiful, but this is the only way to give an answer to a person if he has not thought about the structure of his letter to you. <br><br>  <strong>Always answer letters</strong> <br><br>  Communication by e-mail is significantly different from communication by telephone or correspondence by mail pigeons.  The main difference is the speed of communication.  There are only two means of more rapid communication - ICQ (and others like them) and personal communication itself. <br><br>  Make it clear to the person who wrote you the letter that the letter has arrived - even if your answer is a banal "OK."  If you can answer immediately - reply immediately: E-mail implies efficiency, and it will be pleasant to a person if you respond promptly. <br><br>  <strong>One letter - one task</strong> <br><br>  If you write a letter to a person, do not forget that he is a person, not a robot.  If you want to convey a lot of information that requires different actions (for example, write a report on the meeting, a schedule for the week, your thoughts about sales and the question of where the corporate party will take place), pass this information in different letters.  Think about the person who will have to disassemble your letter - it is much easier to work if each action lies in a separate letter and when performing the action your interlocutor closes the next letter and opens a new one. <br><br>  <strong>Think before you send</strong> <br><br>  Before you send a letter (especially it concerns important letters), remember the saying: ‚ÄúMeasure seven times - cut once‚Äù.  Once again, read the letter - are you all succinctly and concisely stated?  Have you made any grammatical mistakes?  Are you mistaken in the name of the person to whom you send the letter? <br><br>  <strong>Do not trust robots</strong> <br><br>  Some email clients offer you to automatically put a welcome inscription, such as "Hello, ...".  I would not trust robots - I always write a greeting myself, for example, ‚ÄúGood afternoon, Lyudmila Vasilievna ..., because  The use of robots can lead to poor results when a person incorrectly entered his / her full name, for example.  And maybe you‚Äôll get such a letter: ‚ÄúHello, Regional‚Äù or ‚ÄúHello, tanka87‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40226/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40226/</a></p>
