Fortunately, there is a successful project in the West - this is the well-known <a href="http://kickstarter.com/">KickStarter.com</a> . <br><br>  Already great!  And what about us?

      And we have gas in the apartment, and gasoline ends ... (joke, but it seems like a joke already).  So, a cursory analysis revealed the presence of at least 4 crowdfunding projects in RuNet + the newly emerged factory of startups from Yandex.  The situation is almost a stalemate, a new KickStarter clone in Russia is not needed. <br><br>  What about bringing KickStarter itself to Russia? <br>  This is where the fun began! <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We used Kickstarter, started studying it from the inside, tested sending platage (donates) to good projects, tried to create your project, started an account on Amazon, reached the sending request for the project, learned that <i>Kickstarter was two years old at the end of April</i> , we learned that the project was born happened between April 27 and 28 ... And they decided to act. <br><br>  - What do we have that can help this project to come to our country? <br>  - Does this project want to expand its presence? <br>  - How to draw attention to yourself? <br>  - What do we want to get? <br><br>  Answering these questions, we drew an algorithm of actions. <br><br>  1. we have people, opportunities, understanding and desire; <br>  2. they have a desire to expand, but there is no clear understanding of the terms (as it is written on the website); <br>  3. To attract the attention of the project to yourself in different ways, but the most logical is to place your idea on it and try to work out the whole scheme using your own example; <br>  4. we want to become a part of Kickstarter, and are ready to solve serious problems - maximum.  Minimum - we want to create a serious informational occasion, with the mention in the news feeds not only in Russia, but also in America. <br><br>  So, we decided to place our project <i>‚ÄúKickstarter in Russia as a startup!‚Äù</i> On Kickstarter, gathered people, discussed the idea, and decided to make a video presentation that will tell everything itself. <br><br>  This is what happened with us: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKOuDjba8ik%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjWbVHs6FH_Azasi8v-35PHXIJG3g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Watching the video can and should cause a bunch of questions, and we will definitely answer them, for this we have come to the <i>stronghold of ideas and constructivism of Runet</i> !  But, as some kind of excuse, let's clear up ahead: <br><br>  - we had a very limited budget (START), many participants in the process worked for the idea; <br>  - we were limited in time (less than a month), because we tried to be in time for the birthday; <br><br>  When the product of our activity was on hand, we showed it to a focus group in our country, and sent it to the KickStarter `a team for evaluation.  But today we received an answer that the format of our idea does not fit into the concept of the site itself ... Sorry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/252/fe7/615/252fe761566fb4e647123f784bd7c416.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And it's all?! <br><br>  No, this is just the beginning.  We are on the right track, and continue to correspond with the team.  We want our project to become available to the world community, and even if now our activity does not coincide with the Kickstarter development plan, it is important for us to know the potential of our idea. <br><br>  We are counting on your support, even if it is just a kind word, a link on Twitter, or a one-dollar pledge (when we get into PROJECT OF THE DAY) :) <br><br>  And here we communicate: <br>  blog: <a href="http://kickstarterrussia.tumblr.com/">kickstarterrussia.tumblr.com</a> (team blog in English) <br>  home: <a href="http://kickstarterrussia.ru/">kickstarterrussia.ru</a> (chronology of communication in Russian and English, do not judge the site strictly) <br>  email: kickstarter.russia@gmail.com <br><br>  Thanks to all!  We are waiting for critics, advice and constructive. <br><br>  ps: I wanted to place a post in ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù, but ‚ÄúYou do not have enough karma.  To write to this blog, karma must be at least 20 ". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118291/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118291/</a></p>
