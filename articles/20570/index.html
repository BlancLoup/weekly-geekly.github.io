  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New E-xecutive: what's hidden</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A little less than a month has passed since <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/community_life/34623.html">the launch of the</a> updated version of the <a href="http://e-xecutive.ru/">E-xecutive</a> managers' community site, and on Wednesday its owners held a press conference for its first official presentation.  This event thoroughly shook up both the community members themselves (the most impressionable of them, accustomed to long-term stability, at first even demanded that everything be returned in the old way, and very emotionally), and all those interested in the topic of social networks.  The latter, it seemed, no longer expected changes in the form and content of the first professional community in RuNet, which was created almost in strict accordance with the spirit of Web 2.0 even before the term ‚ÄúWeb 2.0‚Äù appeared, but which had exhausted its innovativeness for a long time.  And a whole new generation of Web users who have come to it in the last year or two have hardly heard anything at all about this, indeed, the dinosaur of the domestic Internet. <br><br>  But the dinosaur no longer wanted to be such, and, turning from the path of evolution, decided to turn itself into a kind of light doe.  And if the external commercial aspect of the issue is the expectation of an audience growth of up to 900,000 visitors and some of its ‚Äúrejuvenation‚Äù as a result of a big step towards modern media and social services - this will be an occasion to summarize only after some time, the technical part appeared in a relatively designed form now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As Pavel Mitrofanov, IT director of <a href="http://www.b2bmedia.ru/">B2B Media's</a> management site, told us at a press conference, after Bitrix was chosen as a new technical platform.  Continue to understand the old engine, a complete picture of which had not a living soul, was already fraught.  And among the ready-made CMS, only Bitrix was supported by a large number of domestic integrator companies, among which a tender was held to transfer the resource to new rails.  Many potential contractors, assessing the complexity and risks of the order, refused it (among them are really strong companies that have been working on the market since the very beginning of the Russian Network). <br><br>  As a result, the tender was won by QSOFT, which already has experience with large-scale relocations to Beatrix.  Its executive director, Denis Mitrofanov, said that over the year of work on E-xecutive, many useful improvements were made to the original CMS, which were later included in its new releases (in particular, support for the folksonomy).  With the result, everyone is generally satisfied.  The problems that are traditionally attributed to this system, for example, unstable operation on parallel servers under high loads, ‚Äúarise only for those who cannot properly configure Bitrix,‚Äù says Denis.

      Among other exciting topics at the press conference discussed the issue of well-known critic of the site administration Sergey Khromov-Borisov about the fall in the number of views after the update.  Pavel explained this by the fact that about 40% of the traffic now goes to the <a href="http://old.e-xecutive.ru/">old version of the</a> site, where all the forum threads that were indexed by search engines were left to read and will be of active interest to readers for a long time.  However, at the same time, the total number of views of the old and new versions has increased. <br><br>  Other materials of the site were transferred to the new platform (which took quite a while: only the texts were uploaded to the server for a week), and their indexation at the old place was closed. <br><br>  About the partnership of E-xecutive with Google, whose services were integrated with the site in just a couple of days, you can read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/google/36236.html">here</a> . <br><br>  Among all these interesting positive news, and the resource of the team that has clearly risen in a month, still catches the eye a weak interest in the press, which raises doubts about the feasibility of plans to increase the popularity of the resource.  The site is loyal to the administration of ‚Äúopinion leaders‚Äù in the community who could bring new users with them, the site is still not enough.  An innovation, the Higher League, the elite inside the elite, which gives its members special rights and opportunities on the site, will help attract them.  Show it to us promise in the near future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20570/</a></p>
