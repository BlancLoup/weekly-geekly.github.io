  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Acronis Research Labs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day!  Starting from the new year, we are planning to significantly update our blog, talk about a bunch of interesting things, arrange a virtual tour of our divisions, attract new specialists and show how our products are developed, but we still need to live by January 1st, so for now we‚Äôre only ready to warm up Your interest in the upcoming changes interesting posts.  Today, for example, we will tell you about our R &amp; D center, Acronis Labs, which (by the standards of the company itself) was organized quite recently, but has already borne fruit, and most importantly, continues its work and is pleased with the results of its activities as the employees of the parent company , and those whose minds and hearts he combined in search of answers to the question posed: how to protect your data in the most effective way. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Almost thirteen years ago in the Acronis office there were no more programmers than fingers on one hand.  Now we have more than 700 people working, their jobs are scattered in 18 countries of the world, and the word Acronis automatically appears in many people when it comes to backups and data recovery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/67b/8d7/345/67b8d7345d971bddc73bd01322190310.jpg" alt="image"><br><h4>  Acronis Labs: what, where, when? </h4><br>  Literally in the first days of December, we launched a new structural unit, which, frankly, is more like a research and development center, a forge of high technologies in the field of backup, than just a ‚Äúdepartment for developing new software‚Äù. <br><br>  The Acronis Labs division is housed in our Moscow office, ‚Äúat the helm‚Äù is <b>Maxim Lyadvinsky</b> , the co-founder of the company and the head of its key development.  The main objective of the R &amp; D center is to help the company maintain its leading position in the market for the protection of user data.  Note that this is no longer just a matter of backup (which certainly plays an important role in preserving important information), but it‚Äôs about data protection: an integrated approach to ensuring integrity, availability, recoverability and data deduplication allows you to achieve far better results than simple making copies of information in various ways.

      Acronis Labs has quite specific tasks and goals: <br><ul><li>  Improving the efficiency of existing technologies; <br></li><li>  Creation of new solutions for further implementation in products; <br></li><li>  Development of unique high-tech products; <br></li><li>  The introduction of a unified testing system; <br></li><li>  Patenting new technologies. <br></li></ul><br><br><h4>  Internal R &amp; D Lab </h4><br>  In our view, Acronis Labs will be a symbiosis of the four internal units that closely interact with each other: <br><br>  <b>Core Lab</b> : a division for creating strategic technologies that will be the foundation for future Acronis products.  Development of new technologies and solutions will be fully transferred to the scope of this laboratory, while product teams will continue to focus on current versions and technologies, business logic of products, customer service and sales. <br><br>  <b>Performance Lab</b> : a unified methodology for measuring the performance of Acronis products and approaches to improving their effectiveness will be developed here.  To evaluate the performance of current products, Performance Lab will work with product teams, and with Core Lab, for testing and analyzing the performance of new technologies and solutions of next generations.  A large part of the investment will be aimed at equipping the laboratory with the most modern equipment. <br><br>  <b>Intellectual Property Lab</b> : The role of IP Lab will be not only to register patents on concepts and technologies (created by Acronis Labs developers and experts), but also to stimulate promising ideas among all employees of the company and to obtain registered patents.  I would like to remind you that Acronis is also one of the leading Russian IT companies in terms of the number of existing patents for final products and algorithms.  We hope that the activity of IP Lab will only strengthen its leadership position. <br><br>  <b>Product Lab</b> : the team of this division will create high-tech solutions with the latest technologies for a small group of advanced users.  This will allow to run in new technologies before turning them into products for the mass market. <br><br><h4>  People and money </h4><br>  Naturally, how many R &amp; D centers do not run, they don‚Äôt cost anything without funds and without people: after all, it‚Äôs talented mathematicians, programmers and data recovery experts who work on new products, and Acronis Labs is just a handy tool that allows people realize their potential and at the same time receive a worthy reward for their work. <br><br>  For the first time, a budget of $ 10,000,000 was allocated for the development of the laboratory (ten million, not a typo).  The backbone of the team is the most experienced specialists and programmers who have many years of experience and have been working in our company almost from the day of its foundation, but there is not enough just one core in order for the laboratory to live and move forward. We need ‚Äúmuscles‚Äù, fresh blood.  In addition to cooperation with leading technical universities of the country (which, of course, though they graduate young specialists, but obviously not in the amount in which we would like), we want to replenish our ranks with highly qualified specialists already working in the industry. <br><br>  We know for sure that Habr is a cake, and with a high degree of probability we are read not only by students, mobile application developers, web developers and bearded system administrators (their work is also important and clear to us), but also by system programmers hardened in battles with bugs , deadlines and complex tasks.  In the next couple of days we will update the vacancy block, take a look, perhaps, find the job of your dreams.  ;) <br><br>  And finally, I would like to share the words of the company's general director, Sergey Belousov: <br><br>  - ‚ÄúThe success of the company depends on how it looks to the future.  We are launching Acronis Labs to stimulate the emergence of new technologies, to increase the efficiency of development and the innovativeness of our solutions.  Acronis Labs experts will create new technologies for next-generation products, and product teams will be able to concentrate their efforts on releases, business logic and increase the speed at which products enter the market. ‚Äù <br><br>  It is interesting to work in Acronis, to take part in the development of a new project?  Look at vacancies on Huntim, write about your desire in the comments or in private messages, we will be happy to answer you, because we need you.  ;) <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> <br>  Since you have climbed under the cut and bother to read the text, please answer a couple of questions, it is really important for us to know your opinion! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206690/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206690/</a></p>
