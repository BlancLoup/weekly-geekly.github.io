Here's how to understand their interests and motives, before they leave the site, in time to bring them to the purchase or other targeted action. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We spent several months working on a completely new direction in the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Dlive">Carrot Quest</a> service (who still do not know, this is a service for working with visitors and communicating with them so that you will not miss a single customer).  The service combines the main marketing tools: e-CRM, online chat, email newsletters and pop-up windows. <br><br>  But we want to tell you about the new features, about the Live section, which will help you: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  Increase online sales at the expense of those users who are currently on your site; </li><li>  Analyze user behavior and improve activation, understanding of value in the product; </li></ul><br>  In the Live section, you can see in real time everyone who is currently on your site and the actions that each user performs.  And also, write to any of them via chat or several pop-up windows.  Below is shown how it looks in the service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ce3/628/901/ce36289018665f030b02f753ac95e388.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Imagine, you know what all users on your site are doing right now, you see the individual actions of each visitor.  For example, you know that the user "Vasily Petrov" on your website right now began to make an application for a tour to Italy (cost 70,000 rubles), but for some reason it didn‚Äôt finish it in a few minutes, it is likely that there were questions (problems) and he can leave. <br><br>  Most visitors, faced with a small problem, simply leave.  Therefore, they need additional work.  If earlier it was impossible to track such users in real time, now we have gone even further.  You do not want to miss such a profitable potential client, the more he is 90% ready to buy?  Therefore, you can contact the conditional Vasily Petrov, help him and bring to the purchase.  Sometimes it is enough just to ask a question and it will encourage the user and increase confidence in the purchase. <br><br>  Recently, we wrote a detailed article ‚Äú <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/38-prodazh-za-schet-onlajn-konsultanta-dlya-sajta-kak-dobitsya-takogo-pokazatelya/">38% of sales at the expense of an online consultant ...</a> ‚Äù in which they said that in the final stages of buying people‚Äôs sense of risk increases and how it can be mitigated by communicating with the client. <br><br>  At that moment, when he stopped in the design of the order, you can write to him in 3 ways: <br><br><br><h4>  <b>Chat message</b> </h4><br>  This is the most "democratic" way to communicate with the user.  The chat message does not jump on the half-screen, but gently addresses the visitor to your site.  Then he will decide whether it is relevant for him.  If he is busy placing an order, as in the example above, but he does not need help, you will not distract him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/85d/071/db0/85d071db0e901b8362e87e5dbbc8a05f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Earlier, we described in detail about our chat in the article ‚Äú <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/kommunikacii-3-0-ili-novyj-seksualnyj-chat-ot-carrot-quest/">Communication 3.0 or new sexual chat</a> ‚Äù <br><br><br><h4>  <b>Show small popup</b> </h4><br>  You can send the user a small pop-up that does not interrupt the user's session.  It will appear in the corner of the site and if the user is ready, he will take the target action in this pop-up window. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c8c/696/66a/c8c69666a8b40ebf94481982fafd6301.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is important to note that you will immediately receive a notification about the user's response and you can continue to <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/7-vazhnyx-izmenenij-v-kommunikaciyax-s-polzovatelyami/">chat</a> with him <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/blog/7-vazhnyx-izmenenij-v-kommunikaciyax-s-polzovatelyami/">in the chat</a> . <br><br><br><h4>  <b>Show large popup window</b> </h4><br>  If for some reason you decide to interrupt the user's session and show a large pop-up window that he cannot miss, then this can also be done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c3f/e3e/451/c3fe3e4514bb5f04e13e628d1b9062e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Such a pop-up window interrupts the user's session and until he closes it, he will not be able to scroll the site.  Sometimes it is useful, but not always.  Here it is important to understand that it is worth sending it only when you are 99% sure that the user will see this as a benefit. <br><br><br><h4>  <b>You can select a user segment and send a message to the entire segment.</b> </h4><br>  If there is a large flow of visitors to your site, then in the Live section itself you can filter them (divide into segments by their actions).  This will allow you to work and track in real time only those who are very important to you (for example, those who have already started to place an order or have looked through the same product several times - because these are the hottest leads). <br><br>  We understand that often there is no time to write to each user.  Therefore, we made it so that you could send a message to the entire segment at once (for example, those who did not complete the application, came to the UTM tag or came from Germany, etc.). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f7e/9f5/64a/f7e9f564a6c80561645b344c3139fbe5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It is important to catch many users on your site, because they may never return.  Taking into account the fact that not ordinary visitors leave email, there is a risk that there will be no other opportunity to sell them.  Therefore, periodically it is necessary to track the segments of such visitors on your site and using different tools to bring them to the purchase.  Moreover, many are already ready to buy from you, only they lack just a little of your attention. <br><br>  With pleasure, the <a href="http://www.carrotquest.io/%3Futm_source%3Dmegam%26utm_medium%3Dcontent%26utm_campaign%3Dlive">Carrot Quest</a> team.
