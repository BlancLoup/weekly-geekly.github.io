  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Caution: Intruders</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, users have complained to us about ads in which they are supposedly offered money as a gift on behalf of Yandex.  In this case, the person is asked to enter the mobile number, and then the activation code from the received SMS message.  If the user does so, then, without knowing it, connects a paid SMS subscription.  They start sending SMS to him, for example, with the weather forecast, and every day they charge him money from his mobile account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba1/1c9/275/ba11c927586a1bfd7c9fe7abcd095690.png" width="612" height="208" alt="Caution: Intruders"><br><br>  We are not related to such ads, even if they appear on the background of Yandex.  And, for our part, we are trying to protect you from the actions of intruders.  Now Yandex is actively identifying pages created to lure a phone number.  The warning that it is better not to enter these pages appears in the search results, in the Yandex Browser and other software. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In addition, we identify sites where the code is installed that triggers the display of ads of intruders.  The presence of such code reduces the quality of sites, so they will appear in the search results lower than better quality resources. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Scammers deliberately fake web pages for well-known sites that people trust.  They use the name of not only Yandex, but also other popular services, such as VKontakte or Odnoklassniki.  In addition to promises, there are threats and warnings - for example, ‚ÄúYour account has been hacked‚Äù, ‚ÄúAnti-Virus is outdated.  Urgently update. <br><br>  Be careful not to fall for the tricks of the intruders and help your less advanced technically friends and relatives.  We have even prepared a ready list that can be shared with not quite technically advanced people who have fallen for such a scam. <br><br><h4>  If someone is already caught, here‚Äôs what you can do: </h4><br><ol><li>  First of all, turn off the SMS subscription.  How to do this, you can find out from your mobile operator - on the website or by calling its support service.  You can also inform the operator of the fact of fraud and ask for a refund for the service, which you have been imposed by deception.  Below you will find links to the relevant sections of the sites of the largest operators. <br><br>  <b>Mts</b> <br>  MTS Contact Center - <a href="http://www.mts.ru/mob_connect/help/service_abonents/contacts/">www.mts.ru/mob_connect/help/service_abonents/contacts</a> <br>  How to find out the cost of services by short numbers and block SMS subscription - <a href="http://www.mts.ru/mob_connect/entertainment/short_voice/">www.mts.ru/mob_connect/entertainment/short_voice</a> <br>  Cases of fraud can be reported to 911@mts.ru. <br><br>  <b>Megaphone</b> <br>  Inquiry service - 8 800 550-05-00 <br>  How to block SMS subscription (for Moscow Region subscribers) - <a href="http://moscow.megafon.ru/services/content/stop_content/about.html">moscow.megafon.ru/services/content/stop_content/about.html</a> <br>  MegaFon Anti-Fraud <a href="http://stopfraud.megafon.ru/">Project</a> - <a href="http://stopfraud.megafon.ru/">stopfraud.megafon.ru</a> <br>  Where to report fraud - <a href="http://stopfraud.megafon.ru/feedback/">stopfraud.megafon.ru/feedback</a> , phone - 0500 (from MegaFon numbers). <br><br>  <b>Beeline</b> <br>  Support Center - 0611 (from Beeline numbers). <br>  How to block SMS subscription - <a href="">safe.beeline.ru/cpa/bw.wbp</a> . <br>  How to enable or disable subscriptions - <a href="">safe.beeline.ru/cpa/podpiski.wbp</a> . <br>  Where to go in case of fraud - <a href="">safe.beeline.ru/smc/if/index.wbp</a> . <br><br></li><li>  Check your computer using antivirus.  You can use, for example, the free Yandex version of <a href="http://kaspersky.yandex.ru/">Kaspersky Anti-Virus</a> or antivirus programs from the list <a href="http://help.yandex.ru/webmaster/%3Fid%3D1116618%26ncrnd%3D4878">on this page</a> (paragraph 2).  After that, you can see if the virus has changed the DNS address on the computer or entries in the hosts file (in case of a substitution, the browser can open the wrong site).  If you do not understand this, ask someone of your friends. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Network security </h4><br>  Fraudulent ads are shown not only on web pages that are tampered with by Yandex or popular services.  A message such as ‚ÄúYour account has been hacked‚Äù may appear on any site where the code that launches the display of such ads is installed.  By clicking on them, users navigate to the page created by the attackers.  In addition, the cause of the messages may be a virus settled on your computer.  Here are some simple tips on how not to fall for the tricks of a scam: <br><br><ol><li>  Try to be critical of the tempting or intimidating ads you meet on the net.  Do not buy on ‚ÄúGiving you 500 rubles‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour browser is outdated and will be disabled‚Äù, ‚ÄúYour account in VK has been hacked‚Äù.  It is unlikely that someone will just throw money away, and browsers never warn about their disconnection.  Consider if there is a link between the site on which you are located and the message that appears.  For example, can a bank of abstracts know that your Odnoklassniki page has been hacked.  If you want to make sure that everything is in order with your account, go to the social network in the usual way - without clicking on the dubious message. <br><br></li><li>  If you are asked for a phone number or other personal information, figure out who exactly is asking.  Look at the address of the web page: if it has errors or other oddities, the page is most likely unsafe.  For example, the address of Yandex is yandex.ru, and the address of yandex.ru.546827.84756.ru is no longer Yandex. <br><br></li><li>  Use software that reduces the likelihood of being hooked.  We advise you to install, for example, Yandex Browser or our build of Firefox.  They warn of pages that are better not to open.  If you are used to another browser, you can add elements to it.  This is an extension that also warns about unreliable pages.  To protect your computer, install an antivirus program. <br><br></li><li>  Tell us about the new way of luring money to your loved ones, especially children and older people who are not well-versed in the Internet.  The more people will be in the know, the less money will get the scammers. <br><br></li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/171749/">https://habr.com/ru/post/171749/</a></p>
