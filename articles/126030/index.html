  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Intellectual property protection in the aerospace and defense industries</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The abduction of intellectual property (IP) is one of the biggest and potentially dangerous risks for a modern business, both for a private entrepreneur opening a auto repair shop and for a multi-billion aircraft manufacturer.  This is a risk for which most companies are very poorly prepared.  Intellectual property is most often stolen, made available to competitors and may be compromised in one of two ways: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Open technology theft by unscrupulous employees <br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúLeaks‚Äù resulting from the unintentional disclosure of information and occurring in the process of interaction between people from different departments or external partners from among suppliers <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Regardless of what is causing the loss of IP, it carries a destructive impact for the company.  IP theft often results in counterfeit products on the black market.  Using a stolen design, attackers make products that copy original goods up to the logo, and thus mislead consumers.

      According to a report by the US Department of Commerce published in January 2010, from 2005 to 2008, the number of counterfeit electronic goods in the defense industry more than doubled.  When it comes to protecting intellectual property in the aerospace and defense industries, general contractors have to face special risks. <br><br>  The need to reduce the time and cost of creating sophisticated products, such as airplanes and weapons systems, forces companies to devote more and more responsibility for developing and integrating major subsystems to their contractors.  At the same time, contractors get access to valuable data that should not fall into the hands of competitors.  And one of the top priorities for aerospace and defense companies is national security considerations and, accordingly, information security. <br><br>  Currently, most companies seeking to protect intellectual property use one of two approaches: <br>  ‚Ä¢ The so-called "manual method" - implying the development of special procedures, the execution of which is monitored by a small group of people, united in the department of control of document flow.  The tasks of this group include tracking and controlling the process of moving and using data. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Automated method that requires separation of data in several systems according to their location, and providing access only to persons belonging to these systems. <br><br>  Both approaches have significant drawbacks.  The first one does not offer any real protection for the IC, since manual methods are easy to circumvent.  The second approach essentially transfers responsibility for controlling the company's IT staff responsible for controlling access to the information system, which ultimately complicates access to the necessary information, hampers collaboration between stakeholders and leads to unnecessary IT costs. <br><br>  Currently, a more convenient approach is available to manufacturers, making it easy to find a reasonable balance between the needs for close cooperation and constant control over intellectual property. <br><br>  This approach focuses on the deployment of a new generation of product lifecycle management (PLM) systems.  PLM-platform allows you to combine data from several control systems and create a central repository of information for all projects.  Thus, the PLM platform performs the task of monitoring product development and protecting intellectual property. <br><br>  When using PLM solutions, all requests for access to intellectual property within the framework of any project are controlled by a single system capable of determining in real time the user's access rights to the requested information, based on his authority and physical location.  Thanks to the use of PLM solutions, the international teams of all the countries participating in the project can work more efficiently together, following the rules of export control (ITAR and EAR), as well as intellectual property laws.  The risk of intellectual property theft is a big problem for companies, but it can be solved with a competent approach to the organization of all technical processes.  With the proper construction of a system of interaction and management in the field, manufacturers can conduct business without fearing that their most valuable asset, know-how, will be stolen or depreciated. <br><br>  Dassault Systemes PLM-systems provide not only complete control and simple management of all information about technological processes associated with the design, development and maintenance of products, but also reliably protect all information about the production process.  They are used in the defense and aerospace industry of many countries of the world.  Dassault Systemes cooperates with aircraft manufacturers such as Boeing, Airbus, Kamov Design Bureau and Antonov ASTC. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126030/</a></p>
