  <section class="page js-page"><h1>For Wi-Fi, you will answer or 6 ways to increase the profit of the institution due to the software that identifies users</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  With the introduction of fines for the lack of mandatory identification of users, the owners of cafes, restaurants, hotels, cinemas and other establishments that provide visitors with free Wi-Fi, were at a crossroads.  You will go to the right (you will install the necessary software) - you will spend on software.  Go to the left (ignore the requirements of the law) - you risk getting a fine.  But it turns out that there is a third way: to go straight ahead, so that both the law can be fulfilled, and it turns out to be profit, to acquire software, quickly recoup it, and then also earn money from it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/643/18e/21e/64318e21e23e42618e529b7f5edd46ac.jpg">  " <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><blockquote>  Today, when everyone around is doing what they say about the crisis, the activity of any company should be subject to one rule - maximizing profit at minimum cost, but not at the expense of reducing the quality of a product or service.  Any software that you buy, even for the sake of a high purpose - to become a law-abiding entrepreneur - can be a dead weight of the cost of the company, while it is ultimately designed to increase the profits of the enterprise.  In addition to the main functionality - blocking pages by the registry of resources prohibited by Roskomnadzor, filtering content that is not intended for children, restricting access for all kinds of users and their mandatory identification - we have integrated tools into our system to attract additional customers to your business.  A lot of mechanisms.  We provide customers with a ‚Äúwhite‚Äù page for requesting access to a free Wi-Fi network and tell you how to build an audience with it, educate loyal customers, increase sales conversion and launch a pre-sale technology.  All this ultimately leads to payback of the software product and to making money on it.  In addition, we give the SMM manager a powerful tool that motivates him to work with the tripled force to promote the goods and services of the establishment. </blockquote>  <i>Andrey Davidovich,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>General Director of <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/">Smart-Soft</a></i>

    <h3>  <b>6 ways to increase the profit of the house through software that identifies users of free Wi-Fi networks</b> </h3><br>  <b>Attract visitors to institution accounts in social networks.</b>  After authorization via SMS, the system will offer the client to go to the establishment page on the social networks ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù, ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù, ‚ÄúInstagram‚Äù, ‚ÄúOdnoklassniki‚Äù, ‚ÄúTwitter‚Äù.  The network owner has the right to provide access to the network only after the visitor likes the page / checks in the institution / places the post in his profile / subscribes to the group. <br><br>  <b>Improve the quality of service by getting customer feedback.</b>  The functionality allows the customer service specialist to place a questionnaire on the quality of service / menu / setting on the start page when connecting to Wi-Fi or in groups of institutions in social networks.  Feedback from visitors will not only eliminate shortcomings in work, increase employee motivation and increase their productivity, but also increase the profits of the entire company as a result. <br><br>  <b>Use the page for requesting access to a free Wi-Fi network as an advertising channel to promote products and services.</b>  On the start page you can post information about promotions and special offers.  Here you can implement the technology of sales, making customers an additional offer to the main order. <br><br>  <b>To educate loyal customers.</b>  <b>The functionality allows you to implement a customer reward system: create his personal page in a social group in social networks, load a regular customer badge into profile.</b>  Subsequently, on the pages of loyal customers, you can post information about new promotions, which his friends will see when updating the tape. <br><br>  <b>To rent a "white" sheet.</b>  The institution can place on the request page for access to the Wi-Fi network advertisements of third-party companies / partners of the institution. <br><br>  <b>Promote brand institution.</b>  The login page can contain any information that works for the company's image and increases brand awareness. <br><br>  In addition, as a bonus from the use of software, the owner of the institution receives full analytics: connection statistics for an hour / day / week / month, clicks of various advertising modules and other information important for building a system for selling goods and services. <br><br>  How long will it take to pay for investments in the purchase of software to identify users and when can I start earning on it?  According to the experience of our company's clients, the cost of acquiring <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/products/restaurant-edition/">Traffic Inspector Restaurant Edition</a> pays off within 4-6 months.  And then - the net profit, the value of which depends on how effectively you learn to use the advertising features of the functional: to communicate with customers, to make special offers, to engage in social networks, to implement loyalty programs. <br><br>  PS And yet, making money on software is just a pleasant addition to its main function: making friends with your business with the law and avoiding possible fines from regulatory authorities. <br><br>  * Begin publication ‚ÄúFor Wi-Fi Answer‚Äù: <a href="http://spark.ru/startup/smart-soft/blog/10880/za-wi-fi-otvetish">Part 1</a> , <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/smart_soft/blog/18892/">Part 2</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295190/</a></p>
