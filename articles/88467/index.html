Because he is expensive.  In any case, it is usually more expensive for physical persons than it should be in our first sense, is it?  Why such software is expensive?  Because in our country few people buy it, so the price is only a consequence of the law of supply and demand.  Is it possible to break this vicious circle and make the licensed software equally comfortable for both the buyer and the developer? <br><br>  Six months ago, several desperate guys, in the past - graduates of Moscow State University (MehMat, VMIK) and the Faculty of "K" MEPI, who had gained experience in large corporations, decided to answer this question in the affirmative.  They registered a company and started to implement a startup, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich seemed interesting to them.  They set themselves a very ambitious goal: to change the market for Russian licensed software for the better. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  These guys were us.

In short, the service allows you to use micropayments to pay for the usual licensed software under the monthly subscription scheme.  Now, for example, an <a href="http://antivirus.popodpiske.ru/%3Ffrom%3Dhabr2-1">antivirus storefront has been</a> launched: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce3/c2a/80e/ce3c2a80e818233b6ba70889ff2e911f.png"></div><br>  Our startup is only 6 months old.  Three of them were preparatory: we registered the company, entered into contracts with copyright holders, rented an office, installed servers, chose technical solutions, etc.  Another three months took the development itself.  The road was very difficult, but on the way we never quarreled, did not disagree, and as a result we are at the starting point ... of our project, of which we are very proud. <br><br><h4>  Briefly about the service <a href="http://antivirus.popodpiske.ru/%3Ffrom%3Dhabr2-3">www.popodpiske.ru</a> </h4><br>  So, we have created a platform on which to place any software or digital content (games / audio / video) in order to distribute it on a monthly subscription basis.  Already, you can buy a licensed antivirus for just 59 rubles per month.  Why pay more than 1000 rubles to be immediately tied to software for a whole year, when you can pay for 59 rubles a month?  There are also better deals: for example, NOD32 antivirus from ESET, which you can buy a subscription for just 89 rubles, and install it on <i>three</i> computers.  Those.  you get a licensed antivirus for less than 30 rubles ... <br><br>  A startup is very simple from the point of view of understanding who needs it and why, but it is complicated from the technological side.  In total, our pen (no, perhaps - our keyboards!) Has more than 200,000 lines of project code in PHP, Java, Perl, C ++.  We had to create a new metalanguage and implement our own billing system on it.  We spent many nights in search of the best design solutions and site navigation.  It turned out with us or not - you decide! <br><br>  In our opinion, a software subscription has a lot of advantages compared to a regular purchase: <br><ul><li>  No need to pay the full cost of the program to start using. </li><li>  You can try different antiviruses and choose the most suitable. </li><li>  You can pay for the program exactly for the period for which you need it. </li><li>  If you do not use, you do not pay.  Paid - started to use again. </li></ul><h4>  ... ‚Äúwait, but where's the margin and how about free cheese?‚Äù </h4><br>  Great question!  Judging by the reviews, some users do not believe that our service is ‚Äúhonest.‚Äù  They think that we (quote) "barges keys".  It intuitively seems to them: if you multiply your monthly payment by 12 months, you‚Äôll get an amount that exceeds the cost of buying a ‚Äúregular‚Äù software key by a year.  Otherwise, where is the margin? <br><br>  And the margin is not in the amount, it is in the "wholesale".  For some products on the platform, a 12-month subscription is even <b>cheaper</b> than buying a license key for a year.  Why?  It's simple: the subscription is based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãmicropayments, so popular on the Internet.  That is why the potential audience of ‚Äúsubscription‚Äù software is much wider than the audience of software with the sale of a key.  As in the case of print publications (for example, newspapers), a subscription is a more massive service than a purchase.  So according to the law of supply and demand, the price for it, as a rule, is lower, not higher. <br><br><h4>  ... but we were distracted </h4><br>  In our service you do not buy the program, but take it as if for rent for 1 month or any other period.  With this, you can manage your subscriptions.  You can suspend a subscription, and then you stop paying for it.  Do not pay if you do not use.  Right?  Yes, I think so! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/30f/239/f06/30f239f06ed4a7e2c8c0a22f2f42bcbb.png"></div><br><br>  If you don‚Äôt want to replenish your account on Popodpiska.ru every month, you can immediately put on it an amount that is enough, for example, for 3 months.  Charges will be made automatically on a monthly basis, and unused funds can be returned or spent at any time on some other software. <br><br>  But a low subscription price is not the only benefit for the buyer.  You can block the antivirus for the period when you do not plan to use it (for example, during holidays, summer vacations, etc.). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/096/862/7ed/0968627ed6abf985ff3bdce054a6233a.png"></div><br><br>  During the period of blocking payment is not charged.  You can remove one service and connect another (if you want to choose the best option; it‚Äôs convenient to test different ones and stop at one option that suits you best). <br><br>  Well, if you have little computer experience (although in this case, how did you get on Habr?), And there were difficulties in choosing which antivirus would suit you best, then you can use a selection helper ( <a href="http://antivirus.popodpiske.ru/wizard/antivirus/">wizard</a> ) by answering a number of simple questions. <br><br><h4>  What software is now available on the alpha version of the platform? </h4><br>  Now our platform hosts the main anti-virus programs from Dr.Web, ESET, Panda.  With each of these manufacturers, we have entered into license agreements under which we have the right to sell their products directly to end users or through third parties (agents). <br><br>  But this is only the beginning, the minimum required to run.  We continue to develop the service by adding new services and products that can be consumed under the subscription scheme.  (Fortunately, from a technical point of view, connecting a new supplier or partner takes up 200 lines of code).  A subscription to another software, games, movies, series, music, books, etc. will appear.  We will say thank you, if you tell me, what would you personally have bought under this scheme? <br><br>  A significant barrier for Popodiskika.ru in alpha version is that they need from time to time - not necessarily once a month, or even less often - to explicitly replenish their account (with electronic money, via bank transfer, via SMS - are supported any types of payment).  Therefore, we went further and launched an integration pipeline with Internet providers.  Several of these integrations are already in full swing and will be presented to the public in beta.  The scheme is as follows: the subscriber, as he is accustomed to, pays 559 rubles a month to his provider, of which 500 (for example) go to pay for the Internet, and 59 - to pay for antivirus or other services Rentsoft in the provider window.  Everything is a single payment, a single check: our billing system takes care of the synchronization of debits.  It is convenient for the user. <br><br><h4>  They write about us </h4><br>  Immediately after the launch, several publications wrote about us: <a href="http://internet.cnews.ru/news/line/index.shtml%3F2010/03/16/382893">CNews</a> , <a href="http://internet.cnews.ru/news/line/index.shtml%3F2010/03/16/382893">CommNews</a> , <a href="http://ruformator.ru/news/article06378/default.asp">Ruformator</a> , <a href="http://3dnews.ru/software-news/588442">3DNews,</a> and a dozen others.  Dr.Web, our partner, has also published its <a href="http://news.drweb.com/show/%3Fi%3D1014%26c%3D5%26p%3D0">press release</a> .  The CITI-FM radio station suddenly and absolutely free of charge made a <a href="http://www.moskva.fm/stations/FM_87.9/programs/%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B2_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5/2010-03-16_11:16:37">small report</a> about us, which caused jubilation and dancing in the office.  But we understand that this is only the beginning, the service requires improvements and the development of functionality, which we are planning to do during the whole of 2010. <br><br>  We ask all friends to come to visit and congratulate the owners!  The address is very simple: <br>  <a href="http://antivirus.popodpiske.ru/%3Ffrom%3Dhabr2-5">www.popodpiske.ru</a> <br><br>  We will be happy if you look at our service and give constructive comments.  Is it clear whether it is convenient to use - we welcome any opinion.  If you yourself become our customers, tell us about your friends or post information about the service in your blog - we will fall at your feet with words of gratitude! <br><br>  We really need your support, first of all, of course, moral. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88467/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88467/</a></p>
