  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ode to young professionals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Talk about our future, our hopes?  About young professionals who come to work in various sectors of the national economy, including  in IT?  The ‚Äúyoung specialists‚Äù can be attributed to a conditional group of people under the age of 30. They recently entered the profession, most likely from a university, not necessarily from a specialized one.  There is little experience: either the first job, or somewhere, something is already up, but there is room for development. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <s>This pig</s> is a young specialist because how.  Almost knows nothing.  Well, maybe something can.  I saw somewhere how to copy-paste correctly.  Kaleidoscope of modern technology and does not imply a deep study.  Quickly pierced the tutorial, spied the answers in the stackflow - and in the prod! <br><br>  Problems begin when the person is required to understand the process as a whole.  Well, quite roughly speaking: here is Frankenstein, he needs to be able to open the doors.  According to the mind you need to sew a hand.  In a hurry, you sewed your leg, with it, too, in principle, it can.  But it will outweigh on the move, and ugly awful.

      Why think about extending a function if it can be copied three times, changing the set of parameters a little?  Why exclude the race and transform the process into a sequential one, if you can just set a timeout and check that it works on the developer‚Äôs machine?  Why remove extra code when you start a new project based on the old one, if this old code ‚Äúdoes not affect the quality, and it also works!‚Äù?  Why write comments and documentation if ‚Äúasked when needed‚Äù?  And the truth - we cut off all the "extra", efficiency at the forefront! <br><br>  What does <s>this horned beast do</s> this young specialist, when he sees the requirement to think systematically, even at a very simple level?  - He stupidly cut in a fool.  Here, he says, it worked for me when I coded.  To think within the framework of the concepts ‚Äúproduct‚Äù, ‚Äúsubsystem‚Äù is not, difficult.  To ask a colleague is difficult.  And why: in the tutorial it works, it means that it should be in our sale too.  Technical debt accumulates, then it will be impossible to support this govnokod?  - Naive flapping eyelashes.  There is no future.  Make and forget - it's probably called agile ... <br><br>  And what does a <s>Krivoruk ram</s> young specialist do when he is put on the look of his flaws and asked to remake taking into account high matters?  - He immediately turns out to be an introvert!  When he enters the company for cookies, table tennis and a cheerful positive atmosphere - he is a relaxed, confident, promising employee with a portfolio on github, and when he needs to work with his hands and head, because the older ones have asked, he is a very busy employee who suddenly dared ask for something over the formal description of the task in jira. <br><br>  Naturally, the <s>freak</s> young specialist begins to make excuses if he is clearly pointed out to his shoals, and even forwards the correspondence with the customer laying aside bricks.  In the openspace smell of responsibility, but our hero does not like this more than anything else.  This is hemorrhagic, stupid, let them clarify the requirements, and in general, there is QA and PM, let them have a headache, if that, the task will arrive.  In short, it is impossible to crush here, and in general, all opinions are equal, each Personality is taught this way! <br><br>  And our <s>brazen impudent</s> young specialist is constantly learning.  He is often absent from the workplace due to attending conferences, listening to courses.  At work, he is often in headphones, he is listening to some Ted's talks (of course, in English), he constantly wants to learn something new.  The only thing he does not want to learn is his main job: how things are arranged here, where to do better.  He rarely makes practical considerations on optimization within a company, it is extremely difficult for him to take and say: ‚ÄúI will do it!‚Äù Because he will begin to do when he becomes the co-leader of a young successful startup, and there is no point in digging into some trifles. <br><br>  There is almost nothing to influence <s>such a rotten radish of</s> such a young specialist.  Firstly, he is not afraid of dismissal.  If anything, support mom.  If you do not support, then do not care.  There is no connection between work skills and long-term success by a young specialist.  Everything is unreliable, everything is incomprehensible.  Yes, and how to live in this country in general? .. Secondly, there are few young people: a demographic hole.  In some industries, in the same IT, it lacks catastrophically.  Expelled - quickly find another place.  Thirdly, he does not understand what ‚Äúdo according to conscience‚Äù means.  Why soar?  The beauty of the code, the beauty of the craft, the beauty of the case are some kind of abstraction.  But translated task in the "solved" - this is real, this is success!  The tester will check that everything works - it means it works!  Test Driven Development is the same! <br><br><hr><br>  Sometimes it seems to me that the world rests solely on us, simple middle-aged peasants.  No, we also have a lot of flaws, gaps in knowledge, there are significant jambs and then a heroic struggle with ourselves.  But we understand something about life that they do not understand ... ‚ÄúIt is necessary‚Äù, ‚Äúit is necessary‚Äù, ‚Äúbeautifully‚Äù, ‚Äúaccording to the mind‚Äù - these concepts on the scales are difficult to measure, but we still do so and not as easier.  And when all the floors of all kinds of hierarchies are finally occupied by young co-hackers, who have no moral imperatives, then the Great World P ... P ... Breakthrough! <br><br>  PS: Of course, if you, dear reader, are young, you can take this libel into your account.  However, I hasten to note that it is you who do not enter this cohort.  Still, on Habr√© the best writers and readers!  A text about the bad. <br><br>  PPS: Does it hurt IT?  Well, substitute any other industry.  For example, the "young journalist."  And look what you did, for example, with "Tape.ru". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/354240/">https://habr.com/ru/post/354240/</a></p>
