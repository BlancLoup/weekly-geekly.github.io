For example, WikiLeaks does not just contain the Wiki prefix, as conceived by the creators, anyone could edit the information contained on the WikiLeaks pages.  In general, the development team believed that this way of working should bring success to the resource, as happened with Wikipedia. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Instead of using small groups of experts to verify documents, WikiLeaks promised its users to allow information to be edited on the site by the ‚Äúentire Internet community‚Äù in order to ‚Äúinterpret documents and explain their significance.‚Äù  In addition, several specialists from several countries of the world initially worked on the resource, mainly mathematicians.

      As we see, now, after almost four years, WikiLeaks is a project of one person, Essendz, who is now associated with WikiLeaks, and WikiLeaks is associated with Essendge.  He gives a press conference and sets the general direction of development of the resource. <br><br>  Instead of being a commanding resource, as it was at the very beginning, WikiLeaks is actually in the same hands, and several of the project‚Äôs co-founders left it immediately after Essend published the documents of the US military regarding the Iraq war without agreeing on the publication with colleagues. .  Those turned around and left. <br><br>  Changed the direction of the resource.  At the very beginning of its existence, WikiLeaks was supposed to work on informing the public about the work of non-democratic regimes in the countries of Asia, the CIS, Africa and the Middle East.  Starting this summer, WikiLeaks began to work exclusively with the United States. <br><br>  Interestingly, all documents that were on WikiLeaks earlier, and had no relation to the war in Iraq, were deleted from the servers of WikiLeaks, and now the filing of documents for the resource by third-party users is now completely closed.  Instead of allowing ‚Äúthe whole Internet community‚Äù to participate in the work of the resource, WikiLeaks gives exclusive rights to work with the resource for various media and the Pentagon, whose experts checked the originality of the documents hosted on the WikiLeaks servers.  Moreover, public comments are now closed. <br><br>  As it was written earlier, the identity of Essenge, since it is an integral part of the resource, is now the No. 1 target in the US, and many leaders have already proposed, if not to remove Essendge himself, then by means of hacking to eliminate the resource. <br><br>  In general, a lot has changed, and much continues to change.  The main thing is that WikiLeaks is no longer very similar to the democratic resource it was at first, now it is the empire of one person ... Maybe this is good, who knows? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288810/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288810/</a></p>
