  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Definition of uptime site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Formulation of the problem</b> <br><br>  Good afternoon friends! <br><br>  Many of us have our own projects on the Internet.  But, as you know, any project is done for people.  There are visitors - there is a development, there are no visitors - there is no development.  But if we believe that our site is very good and should be developed, especially those moments when it is simply unavailable become annoying.  The reasons for the mass, 95% of cases - any problems on the hosting. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      What is most unpleasant - such problems start at the hosting provider exactly when the influx of visitors should be particularly high.  The launch of an advertising campaign, the placement of a link on a popular resource - and it is at this point that the site stops opening (the channel disappears, the server freezes, the disks are gone - the required underline). <br><br>  But even if we leave aside such important points, it still remains the daily life of the site.  How do I know that the site turned out to be unavailable for 3 hours tonight and, say, 1 hour at the weekend?  It is not in the interests of the host to disclose this information.  But this is a big brake on the development of any site, the loss of people who could enter it, but alas, they could not ... <br><br>  Therefore, our task is <b>to find out for ourselves what uptime our site has</b> (and, based on this, to make a decision to stay on the hosting or switch to another). <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Solution Method</b> <br><br>  The way to solve a problem that quickly comes to mind is <b>to start ‚Äúpinging‚Äù the site at regular intervals</b> .  Easy googling on this issue brought me to the site <a href="http://host-tracker.com/">host-tracker.com</a> .  This system has a network of domains all over the planet, from which the required site is pinged.  It seems that everything is like, there is a free tariff with ping every 30 minutes, but here's the statistics they somehow pumped up.  Therefore, slightly modify all the file. <br><br>  For advanced statistics, I wrote two scripts (you can take it <a href="">here</a> ).  The first script (ping_me.php) needs to be given some kind of non-expressive secret name, and locate it on the site under study.  Then the address to this script is registered in the host-tracker system. <br><br>  The task of the script is extremely simple - to write in the text file the moments of the pings that reached the site.  If the ping did not pass - the corresponding record will not be. <br><br>  Then we wait a week, a month or how much.  Our text log file collects the required amount of data, and then analyze it with the second script (analize_ping.php).  He builds a table if a red value appears in her second column ‚Äî this is the time during which the site was unavailable.  Then you can already draw conclusions. <br><br>  <b>Possible errors</b> <br><br>  In my opinion, the following errors can be in all this verification: <br><br>  1. Uptime pinging servers themselves.  We will, however, assume that the host-tracker system itself understands which of its servers are working and which are inaccessible.  So uptime = 100%. <br><br>  2. Big ping period (30 minutes).  Who knows, maybe the site was unavailable for 40 minutes, and two pings fell into this gap, which was considered as one hour. <br><br>  Despite such reservations, the statistics collected on my hosting are not very impressive to me.  Alas, I thought - this is a very stable hosting.  But it turned out ... :-( Well, let's wait for the results for the month. <br><br>  <b>Appeal to the public</b> <br><br>  1. Friends who want to test the system and post their results - you are welcome!  I am particularly interested in <b>knowingly stable</b> hosting - to check how well the host-tracker itself works.  Thanks in advance to everyone who agrees to participate! <br><br>  2. How do you know your uptime?  (if you find out at all) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68955/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68955/</a></p>
