I hope someone will find it useful. <br><br>  Sincerely, Reanimator. <br><br><h4>  Not in megahertz happiness </h4><br><h5>  - ‚ÄúComputer powerful?‚Äù <br>  - ‚ÄúEnough for the eyes and the ears!‚Äù <br>  conversation in a computer store </h5><br>  It all started in the winter of 2005;  from the fact that the ‚Äúhome council‚Äù made a decision to purchase a home computer, it is also a PC, it is also a ‚Äúcomputer‚Äù.  On acquiring this insisted all friends, friends, and - in particular - school teachers.  Well, of course, in this age of information technology, living without a PC is the same as lighting candles in an apartment in Moscow.  The younger generation (in my face) should rapidly master the basics of computer literacy, scribble abstracts and in general become a significant person. <br>  It was decided, it means that it was decided - and in December 2005, a raid was organized to find and catch a suitable instance.  Fortunately, acquaintances immediately suggested a knowledgeable person (and he was really knowledgeable: he was an IT specialist at a large enterprise), and he picked up everything very quickly.  Since in those early years I didn‚Äôt understand computers completely, the only thing I asked immediately was ‚ÄúIs the computer powerful?‚Äù.  The answer was brief, but eloquent;  with the implementation of the gesture "to the throat."  Naturally, I calmed down.  Already then I, in principle, knew that computer games are creatures very demanding on hardware.  And, although the PC was purchased "for work", it was clear to the hedgehog that the games there would appear in the very near future.  Almost before the essays.  So it happened. <br>  The years went by, the laptop was used for the most part as a gaming station.  Gradually, I figured out the architecture and components of the iron box, even overclocked what I could overclock.  Well, the "composition of the PC", of course, memorized.  AMD Sempron 3100+ on the Palermo core, motherboard Epox 8KDA3I (remember this wonderful company, peace be upon her ...), Palit GeForce 6600 128 mb video card.  The RAM gradually grew from 512 to 3x512 mb.  The machine, i.e., powerful for its age, with a good margin of safety.  And it took her a long time. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  I want more powerful! </h5><br>  Yes, this is the standard lust of any gamer or just an avid computer geek.  And this has not gone around the cup.  Exactly at that moment, when he began to slow down S.......  You can laugh for a long time, but our acquaintance happened only in the fall of 2010.  So, 5 years the computer is completely satisfied. <br>  Not such a short time, by the way.  The standards of Western European and American companies provide just such a lifetime of office PCs;  after they expire, they are replaced. <br>  Overwhelmed with a thirst for renewal, I began to rustle on the "iron" sites, gradually saving money.  For six months, such information would have been enough for a dozen consultants in the electronics retailers.  And as time went on, the more and more AMD, Intel, and NVidia moved forward.  Came out the GeForce 500th episode, Radeons 6000th, Sandy Bridge, Brazos, Liano.  Such monsters as Lynnfield and Phenom II managed to become obsolete, Wolfdale Mohicans and much younger Clarkdale retired.  Prices fell, power grew.  It only remained to wait a bit until some Phenom x6 can be bought for cheap. <br>  Of course, I figured out those goals for which such capacities would be needed.  After all, the old computer arranged almost everything, except for some toys, for the sake of which - and only for the sake of which - to change the laptop already then seemed at least foolish.  Typing, surfing the Internet, watching videos, music, photoshop, presentations - all this was enough and enough power so far, even despite the transition from XP to Seven.  The only task for which the strong PC was clearly not enough was video conversion.  Games and work with video are obviously a small circle of tasks.  I needed at least one more to complete the troika, but it wasn‚Äôt - and this was an additional stimulus for waiting.

    <h5>  Is it necessary? </h5><br>  This question arose very spontaneously due to the fact that the game somehow completely got sick.  Perhaps the thing is growing up, perhaps just tired.  The experience of almost all of my friends shows that players sooner or later cease to be insane zadroty.  Moreover, the less they are attacked, trying to tear off the screen, the faster. <br>  And suddenly it turned out that the old PC continues to suit me.  And completely.  Not without reason, AMD 64 was recognized as the most powerful single core processor.  Pentiums 4 no longer pull the weight of modern applications, there are complaints about the brakes.  And AMD Sempron continues to cheer up the strap. <br>  Moreover.  Despite the increase in frequencies, the number of cores, the cache in the processor, despite the huge steps forward in terms of architecture, subjectively, the speed of work in everyday mode (Internet surfing, Word, video) differs very, very slightly.  AMD Athlon 6000+ (old dual-core old man), Celeron 5200 (trimmed Wolfdale), Core2Duo 7600 (almost full-fledged Wolfdale), finally, the newest Core i5 2300 doesn't respond as quickly as you expect, looking at the technical specifications.  Let's see what will happen next (ahead of the long-suffering Bulldozer), but in any case, the priority will not be a race for power, but the achievement of a balance of component performance and minimum energy consumption.  Because the power of modern processors and video cards is abundant. <br>  Unlike the funds going to pay for electricity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128375/</a></p>
