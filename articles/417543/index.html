The goal of the government is to create a single social rating for absolutely all citizens.  And the life of the Chinese will directly depend on this rating.  If the rating is low, they may not give a loan for studies or even not let a suspicious citizen out of the country. <br><br>  In 2016, <a href="https://habr.com/post/372929/">it was reported</a> that the initiators of the project have so far created only a project concept, which, nevertheless, is gradually being developed and implemented.  Even then, in 2016, various versions of this system were tested in several regions of China.  Well, now, it seems, there are already some results.  So, one of the students of a famous Chinese university was almost dismissed due to the fact that his father had a low social rating. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The problem arose from the fact that the student‚Äôs father had once taken a loan of about $ 30,000 from a local bank and could not pay it off.  As a result, he fell into the "black list" of those citizens who can not be trusted.  The officials decided that in this case the son was fully responsible for his father and decided to punish him at the same time, lowering him by several steps in the ‚Äúsocial status sheets‚Äù.

      When the question arose that the son could not continue his studies at the university due to his father‚Äôs debt, he began to pay the loan in order to improve his social rating.  The student continued to study, but the story itself was made public.  The news very quickly spread throughout the country, because here the study at the university is a "social elevator".  The Chinese have to study hard, and this is very difficult, because the education system is quite complicated.  Plus, the path to the future can be closed by a bad mark on the unified state exam in high school. <br><br>  The news <a href="http://opinion.people.com.cn/n1/2018/0712/c119388-30143750.html">reached the</a> state-scale media, and after that, officials from education in the region where the incident occurred were advised not to link the parents' problems (in any case, their creditworthiness) with the fate of the children.  The following article was published in the People's Daily media: ‚ÄúThe opportunity to become a student at a prestigious university should not depend on the provision of parents, the main thing here is hard work and effort.  Artificial restrictions on students' chances of studying at universities violate their right to receive an education. ‚Äù <br><br>  So far, the social rating system that works in the country is fragmentary.  In each province, it is individual, individual fragments are tested and then, if all is well, merge into a single whole. <br><br>  You can lower your rating not only by not paying the loan, but also because of drunkenness, trying to travel without a ticket, deception of a tax inspector, violation of family planning rules. <br><br>  Last year it was reported that both the country's leadership and the leadership of several dozens of PRC regions are working on the implementation of this system.  It is not easy to create such a system, so it is unlikely to become one in the near future.  Interestingly, in some cases the formation of such a system is hampered by local officials.  It is simply unprofitable for them to open information on their region to the central government, otherwise they will either have to justify themselves for many years of deception, or work daily on improving indicators - and most likely both. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhether we will be able to implement this project or not is still unclear, we are in a state of uncertainty.  In any case, this is better than what worked all previous years, when we had no data, and the police judged people based on information received from other people, ‚Äùsaid Meng Tingguang, a political scientist from <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582_%25D0%25A6%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2585%25D1%2583%25D0%25B0">Tsinghua University</a> . <br><br>  As an example of a real punishment of those who have a low social rating, there are several cases of refusal to serve in the army, followed by punishment from the authorities.  Refusing to serve in the army, a citizen of China falls in a position of social rating so much that they cannot study in high school or get a higher education.  As far as one can understand, after refusal, it is necessary to re-train, besides, such ‚Äúrefusers‚Äù are not allowed to go abroad and buy real estate. <br><br>  As one would expect, representatives of foreign human rights organizations consider the Chinese system to be something like the ‚ÄúBig Brother‚Äù, in any case, its prototype.  But some Chinese are quite satisfied with this system.  ‚ÄúI have a feeling that over the past six months, people's behavior has gotten better and better.  For example, at the wheel now we always stop at pedestrian crossings.  If you don‚Äôt stop, you lose points.  At first we were worried about losing points, but now we are used to it, ‚Äù <a href="https://habr.com/post/412263/">said</a> one of the Chinese last year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/417543/">https://habr.com/ru/post/417543/</a></p>
