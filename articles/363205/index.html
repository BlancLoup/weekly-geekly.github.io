A team of 12 high-level IBM employees representing eight countries worked on developing recommendations for four weeks.  The IBM Service Corps, often referred to as the ‚Äúcorporate version of the Peace Corps,‚Äù is IBM's global initiative, driven by the company's desire to contribute to solving social, economic and environmental problems in countries with growing economies.  Project clients include business associations, non-profit organizations, small businesses, educational organizations and government agencies. <br><br>  The subject of the projects is at the intersection of business, technology and society.  IBM experts worked closely with various public organizations to help them attract foreign investment, promote the development of the IT community in the country, develop a strategy for various organizations and help improve the business environment.  To address the challenges facing public organizations in Uzbekistan, IBM experts have used technologies such as mobility, the creation of online portals, business analytics, as well as the experience of the most successful implemented projects in the field of marketing, personnel management, finance and project management.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  As part of the IBM Service Corps, projects have been completed for the following organizations: <br><br>  - <b>Association of International Business and Technology (AMBiT)</b> : As part of the project for AMBiT, a team of IBM experts developed a plan for introducing a specialized solution that will allow for a more efficient work of the front and back offices of the Association.  AMBiT, through the use of best practices in project management, will be able to optimize their business processes and improve operations.  In addition, IBM experts offered the Association specialized seminars in the field of project management, building partnerships, personnel management and talent. <br>  <i>‚ÄúFour weeks of hard work with IBM experts was a turning point for the Association.</i>  <i>IBM employees with whom we interacted changed our approach to work.</i>  <i>I was pleased to see with what enthusiasm and motivation the IBM team of experts worked on the project.</i>  <i>I hope that the recommendations of experts will help us bring the development of the Association to a new level and will significantly improve the efficiency of our work</i> , ‚Äùsaid Khikmat Abdurakhmanov, Chairman of the Supervisory Board of AMBiT. <br><br>  - <b>BePro</b> : The IBM Service Corps team helped the BePro Programming Center develop and implement a plan for the creation of an Innovation Center in Uzbekistan.  As part of the project, IBM experts developed a detailed business model and a plan to attract partners of the future Innovation Center, and also offered options for the organizational structure and consulting department in order to organize more efficient processes directly at the BePro programmers center.  The plan, developed by IBM experts, is distinguished by a high degree of detail, which will enable BePro to proceed with the immediate implementation of the Innovation Center project.  Moreover, the business model proposed by IBM will promote the use of best practices directly by the BePro programmers center, which can increase the chances of the center to receive support from the government and vendors. <br>  <i>‚ÄúWe were pleased to work with the IBM team of experts on a project for BePro.</i>  <i>During the four weeks of the project, a strategic model for the development of the Innovation Center was developed, the advantages that its creation, as well as the implementation methodology were defined.</i>  <i>In addition, a plan for implementing this initiative was written, which will allow us to track our progress in the future.</i>  <i>The knowledge and skills that the IBM Service Corps employees brought to the project will allow implementing the initiative to create an IT Innovation Center in Uzbekistan more successfully</i> , ‚Äùadded BePro CEO Abduvoitjon Gafurov. <br><br>  - <b>Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Uzbekistan</b> : a team of IBM experts helped the Uzbek Chamber of Commerce and Industry to develop requirements for the preparation of a technical task for creating an online office (eCabinet), which will be focused on providing electronic services to entrepreneurs.  These services will include online company registration, submission of information to the tax inspectorate, provision of statistical and other types of reports, payment of taxes and other contributions, and other services required by entrepreneurs.  The IBM Service Corps team that worked on this project also introduced to the CCI of Uzbekistan a project management methodology called Agile Software Development, which allows you to continuously improve processes, use adaptive planning methods and a quick response to changes. <br><br>  - <b>Nazar Business and Technology (NBT)</b> : IBM experts advised NBT on the development of an organization‚Äôs strategy that will improve management systems.  In addition, a team of IBM experts made recommendations on optimizing the organizational structure of NBT, managing work with staff, and improving the company's online representation. <br>  <i>‚ÄúThroughout the project we were very pleased to interact with the IBM team of experts.</i>  <i>We are grateful for the professional and transparent approach to work that IBM employees have adhered to at all stages of the project.</i>  <i>We hope that the end result of our cooperation - the implementation of the NBT development strategy - will exceed our expectations and allow us to provide professional solutions both in our region and around the world</i> , ‚Äùsaid Azim Nazarov, NBT Managing Director. <br>  <i>‚ÄúWe were pleased to accept the first team of the IBM Service Corps in Uzbekistan.</i>  <i>We believe that the teamwork of IBM experts is a powerful tool that allows you to develop projects for municipal and public organizations of Uzbekistan, comparable in level to those projects we are working on for customers in the corporate sector</i> , ‚Äùcommented Uktam Irgashev, head of IBM in Uzbekistan.  ‚Äú <i>We see a high potential in Uzbekistan and a stable interest in developing innovative solutions that will contribute to the further development of the economy and society</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363205/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363205/</a></p>
