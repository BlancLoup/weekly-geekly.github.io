New series of all-welded telecommunication cabinets TM "KUB"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> This review was made in the continuation of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/muk/blog/185434/">post</a> , in which we would like first of all to highlight the question of the prerequisites, possibilities and necessity of manufacturing and improving competitive products in the local market.  This requires professional training and equipping the material and technical base in accordance with international industrial standards.  In general, not an easy task. <br><br>  We are talking precisely about the production of products capable of competing in the average price-quality range (Conteg, Estap Triton).  Since  For aesthetic reasons, I am not interested in cheap, low-quality cases that are made to compete with Chinese "crafts." <br><br>  The cost of delivery of imported cabinets for distributors comes to 25% of their shipping cost.  Is the game worth the candle?  It is worth ...  if there is no alternative.

      Today we will consider a new line of all-welded telecommunication cabinets of the KUB brand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/975/cc3/278/975cc32785cbafe6ad8cbb26d6929282.jpg"><br><br>  According to the manufacturer, the main reasons for the ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù of the series were: <br><br>  1. A number of advantages of an all-welded cabinet design over collapsible models. <br><br>  2. The worked-out production technology for this series, which provides a wide choice of frame sizes (11-19-24-33-37-42-46U / 600x600, 600x800, 800x600, 800x800, 800x1000mm) <br><br>  3. Universality of construction with a gap on the expansion of the range of accessories and the introduction of "nishtyakov" from third-party manufacturers (climatic equipment, cable management systems, etc.) <br><br>  4. Compliance with protection classes IP20 / 30 / IP54 (optional) <br><br>  5.Reversible doors with four-point lock <br><br>  6.The back wall can be easily replaced with a door. <br><br>  7. Possibility of in-line connection of cases <br><br>  But let's not drag out with the text, but let's move on to the most important thing - to the images. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The first photo shows the frame of the XL-IT 24U 600x800mm cabinet (prototype), from which all side walls, the ceiling panel and the bottom protection panel are removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/54b/087/6f4/54b0876f4048d32de4e90806db0a358b.jpg"><br><br>  In this ‚Äústate‚Äù, the cabinet is optimal for mounting equipment, laying cables, etc.  Simply put - thrusting, screwing, connecting and pulling :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/895/785/33d/89578533d333a11436c6a9041b081e7b.jpg"><br><br>  In the new series of cabinets (in other respects, as in the previous ones), the manufacturer focuses on the use of raw materials, materials, components used by European manufacturers.  Since  aims to compete on this particular field. <br><br>  In standard, there are front observation doors with 4mm tempered glass.  Optionally, solid, perforated or non-standard with ‚ÄúWish-Wings‚Äù that can be made to order can be installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2dd/2d2/45f/2dd2d245f41f1705f6cf007b4f066def.jpg"><br><br>  !!!  The improvised test for rigidity and strength of the structure (the declared permissible load is up to 800 kg).  There was not enough space for 10 people, but we wobbled it enthusiastically :) <br><br>  Rear wall mounts can be easily replaced with door hinges.  In other words, the cabinet design allows the door to be installed both from the front and from the rear, both with a left-sided and right-sided opening.  Need a Phillips screwdriver and 10 minutes time.  The glass is fixed firmly and reliably thanks to a special system of sizing, sealing and fixation with ribs (for many others, the manufacturer uses glue or double-sided tape :( <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/19f/d6d/052/19fd6d0529f44a3467adc703830c2c71.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/514/1c8/fc8/5141c8fc850d6108b62478419dca916a.jpg"><br><br>  Cabinets have 2-point (for cabinets 24-28U) and 4-point (33-37-42-46U) locks.  This ensures reliable and ‚Äútight‚Äù locking of doors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/373/b2b/6b5/373b2b6b542682326f66afbe92188c31.jpg"><br><br>  The bottom protection panel and the ceiling panel are unified.  There are notches for the installation of the fan unit and two cable entries (protection cover for the edge of the cable entry is included). <br><br>  At the moment, the factory has the possibility of placing an order for cabinets with adjustable cable glands in the ceiling panel (or bottom protection panel) and IP54 degree of protection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/349/fad/bd0/349fadbd00e59a0edf0224aff6e1e8da.jpg"><br><br>  Easily removable side walls with cylinder locks and latches.  As already noted earlier, the doors can be solid, survey or perforated. <br><br>  Pay attention to the color of the hardware (handle lock, latches).  It is selected in accordance with the color of the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/158/3c5/379/1583c5379c1c04cafa84d0eb3b80cb52.jpg"><br><br>  The design of the cable entry allows you to remove the back wall with the already established cable, or mount it "upside down" if you plan to supply the cable from above.  Cable entry height 8 cm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e38/929/195/e38929195cc1ed480e5fbcca501751e5.jpg"><br><br>  Quick and easy removal of the ceiling panel and bottom protection panel (screw mounting). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd4/b2f/be3/fd4b2fbe3829ddca4d06c96a73426a3a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e1b/de3/860/e1bde38603448fa3917f931486e016ac.jpg"><br><br>  Adjustable 19 "galvanized rails, steel 2 mm.  Perforated profile with a pitch of 25 mm under the standard nuts for installing additional constructs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/50a/d3b/380/50ad3b3804841909ab2da3bb20979d30.jpg"><br><br>  A grounding kit for removable cabinet elements is included as standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/34a/058/acc/34a058accd6211afd6dac338cb041e77.jpg"><br><br>  Opportunities!  XL-IT versions in black (RAL 9005) with 19 ‚Äùpainted guides. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d2c/df4/f5b/d2cdf4f5b4af8ba8d2e94f5e52e142fa.jpg"><br><br>  The main additional options and accessories are: fan units (2,4,6), shelves (5 kg, 20 kg, 100 kg), 19 ‚Äùground bus bars, 100 and 200 mm high plinths, front panels, mounting kits for connecting to the shield , information panels, suspension loops. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/310/8be/7fe/3108be7fe26ee2c5eddea3d1283ff46d.jpg"><br><br>  The cabinet can be installed on: <br><br>  - screw support (supplied) <br><br>  - wheel support (the model is selected depending on the planned load) <br><br>  - base height 100 and 200mm <br><br>  Now about the package.  It includes: <br>  1. All-welded frame with ceiling panel <br>  2. Survey door with lock <br>  3. back wall <br>  4. Side wall with cylindrical locks and latches (2pcs) <br>  5. A set of 19 "guides. <br>  6. A set of ground wires. <br>  7. Support screw (4 pieces), set of edge protection <br>  8. Keys, cardboard packaging, marking tag, pallet, product passport <br><br>  Conclusion: <br>  In general, comparing with the cabinets of other manufacturers that came across my arm in the last 10 years, the all-welded cabinet of TM ‚ÄúKUB‚Äù has aroused interest and a certain patriotic enthusiasm (given the country of origin). <br>  The frame of the cabinet and the door perfectly.  For variety, you can develop several additional cable entry options for the ceiling panel and protection panel. <br>  But on the whole, a product with an original design is worthy of attention at an adequate price. <br><br>  UPD: ALL ALL ALL !!!  WRITE WHAT YOU NEED TO ADD, CHANGE, INSERT <br>  ANYTHING BETTER THAT YOU LIKE! <br><br><hr><br>  <a href="http://www.service.muk.ua/">MUK-Service - all types of IT repair: warranty, non-warranty repair, sale of spare parts, contract service</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190992/</a></p>
