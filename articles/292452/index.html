I hasten to share a completely non-typical business book.  Immediately make a reservation with the popular Nlper statement that ‚Äúa map is not a territory‚Äù, and in the context of this article it only means that my short story will not be able to convey all the advantages of the original, which is why I did not post the outline. <br><br>  So, <i>"45 tattoos manager"</i> <a href="http://batyrevmaxim.livejournal.com/">Maxim (Kombat) Batyrev</a> .  First, the book was published by <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/">all well-known publishers</a> , to whose work I always take great care, and I confess this time they have surpassed themselves. <br><br><h4>  What is not typical and pleasantly surprised by the book? </h4><br>  The author is the current Russian practitioner.  Everything, on it it would be possible to finish, but I will allow myself to describe a little more in detail. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Often, people who have already retired begin to write books, which almost always pursues the goal of earning money.  In this case, it seems to me that the author wrote a book only for another test of himself for strength, and at the beginning of the book Maxim himself makes it perfectly clear.  Such an approach is often covered with a thick layer of pathos, and I confess, at first skeptically folding my eyebrows with a house, I continued reading.  How I was amazed when I realized that there was no double meaning!  Combat, indeed, wrote the book just for fun.  The secret ingredient is real stories, experiences, mistakes and work on correcting them, principles and recommendations that one wants to believe.  Especially when you consider the fact that I had to deal with many things described in the book myself.  But what I expected in the book is not.  No moralizing or reinforced concrete axioms, only confirmed by the practice of the hypothesis.

      Recently, one must admit the rather long, high rank of a manager in Russia has been tarnished.  Our managers call anyone, but not those who really are.  After all, a manager is a manager whose main task is to manage people.  Throughout the reading, the vague sensation of the author‚Äôs surprise from the misunderstanding by many people of this simple and seemingly elementary thought did not let me go.  And here it seems to me you can bring one of the "tattoos" of Maxim. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúWhat is obvious to you is not obvious to others.‚Äù </h4><br>  The fact is that Maxim studied at a military university where everything is permeated with the essence of management and management.  So the fact that it is almost as natural for him as breathing is not so obvious to many others.  Although he did not graduate from college, the training was not in vain, and practically all the described Maxim principles grow his legs just from here, no wonder his nickname is ‚Äúcommander‚Äù. <br><br>  To be honest, first of all in the book I was attracted to the main metaphor.  The principles and the experience gained are transformed into ‚Äútattoos‚Äù on the human body.  This is an interesting metaphor of experience and bribed me to buy and read this book.  The structure of the book is built on the principle of the samurai Bushido code, first a thesis (‚Äútattoo‚Äù), and then an explanatory parable.  The result was 45 chapters, "tattoos". <br><br>  Pleasantly surprised by the absolute ultimatum ultimatum.  Maxim Batyrev does not pretend to be the ultimate truth, but describes real-life cases that may be useful for someone, but they will not help someone.  In general, business literature is now in great favor, but, unfortunately, while foreign sources prevail, even though there is nothing to be done, we have not come to the market economy for a long time.  This is the value applied to the Russian business, it is very much delaying.  Yes, we like to read about the successes of Steve Jobs, Bill Gates and other foreign experts, but no matter how wonderful it would be, foreign models almost never fall into the domestic Procrustean bed, the marketing is longer, the sales stick out.  And extremely often from a slender borrowed system it turns out, absolutely not working, miserable and poor stub. <br><br>  All the "tattoos" of the battalion commander reminded me very much and not a foreign experience of the army.  As we were told during the service, the statutes of the garrison and guard service were written in blood of guards, to paraphrase, I would say that ‚Äú45 tattoos of the manager‚Äù are written by the ‚Äúblood‚Äù of the manager and his subordinates, and at least that's why I recommend <a href="http://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/books/paperbook/tattoos/">this book to</a> everyone, regardless of their position . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292452/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292452/</a></p>
