Everything changed in the new century: more and more companies are dealing with the topic seriously.  They create functional and new inventions.  Among the innovators is the Swedish company Foreo, which produces cult devices for skin and oral care. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  3G, graphene and silicone </h3><br>  The Foreo company was founded in 2013 by the Swede Philip Sedic.  He was born in Bosnia, but this is not the most interesting moment in his biography.  The fact is that he likes to invent different things, and at the moment he has registered more than 200 patents.  What did you invent?  From an eye massager to a Kegel simulator, from a finger-ring massager, to a light skin cleaning method. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aq/rg/qg/aqrgqgso360hmwvy_1x7og4zfm4.jpeg"><br>  <i>The person who invents what you are afraid to even think</i>

      Sedicz actively applied his inventive talents professionally.  At one time he headed one of the first digital marketing agencies in Sweden, he worked on 3G technology at Ericsson and on graphene condoms at LELO. <br><br>  In 2012, Sedich's wife, Ivana, bought herself a brush for the face of a famous brand.  As is often the case, the skin on the face of a woman has become worse due to the brush.  Problem device fell into the hands of a meticulous husband.  He concluded that it is better to wash your hands than to rub your face with such a thing: the nylon bristles and the removable brush head were probably infested with bacteria, and the material was too hard. <br><br>  Surprisingly, a more gentle and hygienic alternative did not exist.  Therefore, an enterprising Swede took matters into his own hands.  This is how the first Foreo product - LUNA face brush.  Hard nylon is replaced with a gentle medical silicone that does not irritate the skin.  Silicone bristles were set in motion by sound pulsations.  In the process of creating a prototype, Sedic actively consulted with his wife. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0z/pq/xo/0zpqxoagao3fvvt69ftmhod2amk.jpeg"><br>  <i>First generation of brushes: Luna mini on the left, LUNA on the right</i> <br><br>  Foreo started with a couple of people, but the company grew quickly.  In 2014, the team assembled by Sedich developed its own version of an electric sonic toothbrush, called the ISSA.  It, compared with competing products, cleaned the teeth delicately, without sacrificing the quality of cleaning. <br><br>  In the following years, several iterations of both brushes came out, and hygienic products appeared for use with them.  In 2018, the company launched a new product: the ‚Äúsmart mask‚Äù of the UFO, a replacement for Korean cloth masks.  The device became another hit and as a result took part in London Fashion Week.  The clever mask refreshed the skin of models that were on the podium during the Victoria Beckham show.  Either the cunning inventor managed to circle the finger of the beauty guru, or a small gadget that looks like a glowing puck really works. <br><br><h3>  Brushes for the face LUNA </h3><br>  Electric brushes LUNA instantly became a hit, once they go on sale.  The company relied on word of mouth and social network.  The approach is fully justified, especially the popularity of new brushes contributed to Instagram. <br><br>  This is not to say that LUNA had no competitors.  The American company Clarisonic, founded in 2000 in Seattle, has been selling its own electric sonic brushes since 2004.  Apparently, this is exactly what Sedic's wife used, but this is not certain.  These priborchiki have replaceable nozzles, and they need to be changed every three months - because of the "fatigue" of the bristles and for hygienic reasons.  On the face there are many bacteria and microscopic creatures such as skin mites, but it is dangerous to replenish the "zoo" with vaginal staphylococcus.  Now Clarisonic belongs to the concern L'Oreal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rf/sv/cv/rfsvcvumnwnwu3knjlpjgxsouve.jpeg"><br>  <i>On the left - Foreo LUNA mini, on the right - Clarisonic brush</i> <br><br>  LUNA does not look like a competing product.  The case of the device is more like a large sponge or washcloth.  The above-mentioned medical silicone, from which the entire surface of the brush is made, is devoid of pores and therefore does not overgrow with colonies of bacteria.  It is enough to rinse the brush under water - and it is again as new. <br><br>  To drive on the face you need to part, where are the silicone bristles.  It is necessary to use the brush together with the means for washing, which is whipped into the foam with the help of vibrations.  These vibrations contribute to the fact that the remnants of cosmetics, sebum and dead cells are actively removed from the skin surface.  In general, it is faster and more efficient than washing with a sponge or with hands.  A massage with bristles additionally gives the skin elasticity, as blood flows to it. <br><br>  Compared to LUNA, the Clarisonic brushes and their copies wash the face ‚Äúto the creak‚Äù.  But leather is not a parquet to rub it up to a mirror shine.  Hard cleaning irritates delicate tissues, contributes to premature aging and is absolutely contraindicated in the presence of inflammatory elements.  Simply put, "Clarisonik" can not be polished acne, because they will become more.  In case of rosacea (vascular "asterisks" and dilated capillaries), the gadget also cannot be used, and aggressive brashing does harm to sensitive skin.  There are no such problems with gentle LUNA. <br><br>  The number of LUNA models has exceeded a dozen.  Let us consider in more detail the new ones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lt/fq/ql/ltfqqlzuvhrvm4p_osavimgu1f0.jpeg"><br>  <i>Foreo LUNA 2</i> <br><br>  <b><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-luna-2/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dforeohabr">LUNA 2</a></b> brush was released in January 2016.  The gadget has four options: for normal, combination, sensitive and oily skin.  To find out what kind of skin you have, the manufacturer offers to take a test on the site before buying, and the models of different types themselves are visually different from each other in color.  The size of LUNA 2 is almost with palm with fingers.  It is just convenient to hold it for the lower part and clean the skin with a wide upper brush.  And if the brush still slips out of the hands and falls into the water - that's okay, the case is water resistant. <br><br>  The brush is controlled by three buttons at the base: in the middle is the power button, the other two switch the intensity of work.  There are only 12 intensity modes. On the back of the brush - a ribbed surface for anti-aging massage.  These ‚Äúribs‚Äù need to massage nasolabial folds, the skin at the corners of the eyes and other parts of the face where wrinkles form within a minute.  It is clear that the gadget should be included. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4t/0i/ea/4t0ieanmdldfcfv61awnaavlpui.jpeg"><br><br>  Foreo brushes can be used with almost any cleanser.  Since the brush is silicone, it should not be applied to it on the basis of clay, silicone, as well as exfoliating compounds and scrubs.  Life hacking: serums, masks, jelly gommazhi and so on are ideally suited in the "partner" brush.  Their action is expected to be enhanced by the massage. <br><br>  LUNA 2 has a ‚Äúmale‚Äù version called <b><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-luna-2-for-men/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dforeohabr">LUNA 2 for men</a></b> .  Now the market of cosmetics for men is growing, largely compensating for the fall in sales of razors due to the fashion for beards and stubble.  LUNA 2 For men is a typical new product.  Actually, what distinguishes the gadget from the "female" version: it is slightly larger, it is brutal black and exists only in one version.  Men's skin is also diverse, but a rare potential buyer spends time trying to figure out a million cosmetics, lotions and compositions.  So brush one, but good! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6a/b1/-e/6ab1-e9cr6dunnr4pqr3fzi2qa0.jpeg"><br>  <i>LUNA 2 For men</i> <br><br>  The logical question is: <b>why is this gadget needed?</b>  It facilitates shaving.  Regular washing softens and tones the skin.  The better the skin, the less cuts, and the longer the razor blades will last (they will be less dull).  Plus, all the same benefits as for women: a massage from age-related changes, a fresher look, less inflammation.  The reverse, ribbed side is good to handle the area under the eyes.  An important point: men suffering from acne and rosacea ("rosacea") should definitely consult with a dermatologist before using such a device. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gZt06uQwVMI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Both brushes are charged from the USB port.  The charge is enough for 450 sessions of 1 minute.  Each washing is like this: you lather your face with a product, and LUNA 2 is dipped into the water.  You can do the opposite and apply the tool to the brush.  Turn on the device, begin to massage one area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe face - forehead, cheeks, chin, nose.  After 15 seconds, the vibration stops, and thus the brush makes it clear that you need to move to another area.  The process takes a minute, after which the remnants of funds can be washed off.  Such automatic help pushes the user to thoroughly wash.  Regular and thorough water procedures, in turn, have a beneficial effect on the skin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ui/mq/9e/uimq9ebnimqn4-pqn_f4krriu38.jpeg"><br>  <i>LUNA mini 2</i> <br><br>  In the same 2016, a reduced version of the brush - <b><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-luna-mini-2/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dforeohabr">LUNA mini 2</a></b> went on sale.  The whole gadget fits in the palm of your hand.  It is devoid of a ribbed massage surface on the reverse side - there are thicker bristles for cleaning oily skin.  The intensity levels are 8, but the strength is the same as that of the large LUNA 2. The brush is universal and has a bristle configuration that should suit any skin type.  Including masculine: for the ‚Äústronger sex‚Äù a black <b>LUNA mini 2 for men</b> brush is offered. <br><br>  The device works just like LUNA 2. You soap your face or brush, turn it on.  Every 15 seconds, it freezes, so that you begin to treat another area of ‚Äã‚Äãskin.  One charge is enough for 300 sessions;  the brush is charged from the USB port in an hour. <br><br>  Foreo's newest brush is called <b><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-luna-fofo/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dforeohabr">LUNA fofo</a></b> .  It is distinguished by the presence of smart functions and sensors of the skin water saturation level.  With their help, the gadget analyzes the state of the skin, and then the mobile application is a personalized skin care program.  Including individually adjusted the processing time of each part of the face. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mc/xz/15/mcxz15b0cdas_pq3_jcqqmogjc4.jpeg"><br>  <i>Foreo luna fofo</i> <br><br>  To get started, you need to download the application Foreo For You and register an account.  It will ask about your age, skin type, the amount of water you drink per day, and the level of activity.  Then LUNA fofo is connected to the smartphone via Bluetooth.  Tying the brush to the application, you need to start the analysis process in the application and touch the four facial zones: the forehead, chin, right and left cheek.  After analyzing the humidity, the application creates a profile for the skin and adjusts the brush. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fd/fk/io/fdfkiogoolv93bw2qzgc8sspmaa.jpeg"><br>  <i>Foreo profile settings</i> <br><br>  The washing process with LUNA fofo is identical to the washing with LUNA 2 and LUNA mini 2. That is, the brush stops the motor each time it is time to move to another part of the face. <br><div class="scrollable-table"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="5">  Comparison of electric facial brushes </td></tr><tr><td>  Title </td><td>  Luna fofo </td><td>  LUNA mini 2 </td><td>  LUNA 2 </td><td>  LUNA 2 For men </td></tr><tr><td>  The size </td><td>  70 x 66 x 38 mm </td><td>  75 x 80 x 28.5 mm </td><td>  102.3 x 82.3 x 35.7 mm </td><td>  102.3 x 82.3 x 36.7 mm </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight </td><td>  70 g </td><td>  67 g </td><td>  135 g </td><td>  135 g </td></tr><tr><td>  Material </td><td>  Medical Silicone / <br>  ABS plastic </td><td>  Medical silicone / ABS plastic </td><td>  Medical silicone / ABS plastic </td><td>  Medical silicone / ABS plastic </td></tr><tr><td>  Frequency </td><td>  150 Hz </td><td>  125 Hz </td><td>  100 Hz </td><td>  100 Hz </td></tr><tr><td>  Noise level </td><td>  ~ 50 dB </td><td>  50 dB </td><td>  50 dB </td><td>  50 dB </td></tr><tr><td>  Speed </td><td>  Depends on skin type </td><td>  2 x 8000 pulses / min </td><td>  2 x 8000 pulses / min </td><td>  2 x 8000 pulses / min </td></tr><tr><td>  Timer </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Intensity levels </td><td>  Auto </td><td>  eight </td><td>  12 </td><td>  12 </td></tr><tr><td>  Anti-aging massage </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Suitable for all skin types </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  4 separate models for each type </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Skin moisture sensors </td><td>  Yes, two </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  Bluetooth </td><td>  there is </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  Nutrition </td><td>  2 AAA batteries </td><td>  Li-Ion 200 mAh battery </td><td>  Battery Li-Ion 530 mAh </td><td>  Battery Li-Ion 530 mAh </td></tr><tr><td>  The number of sessions per charge </td><td>  400 </td><td>  300 </td><td>  450 </td><td>  450 </td></tr><tr><td>  Charging time </td><td>  - </td><td>  1 hour </td><td>  1 hour </td><td>  1 hour </td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><h3>  UFO smart masks </h3><br>  Even if you diligently bypass the topic of cosmetics, you probably have seen the ubiquitous bags of cloth masks in supermarkets.  It is the most famous part of the Asian skin care system.  They owe their fame to ease of use.  The mask, soaked with a special serum, is applied to the face for 20 minutes.  Depending on the composition of the impregnation, the mask operates in different ways: it softens, moisturizes, cleans and evens the skin tone.  Of the minuses - a universal cut, because of which the masks are not suitable for every person, and the large time costs of the procedure.  To show the result, once to put on a mask is not enough.  They are used regularly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ng/ze/u6/ngzeu6hkcdmkdm1zxwjsj6gesiu.jpeg"><br>  <i>Foreo UFO Smart Mask</i> <br><br>  The popularity of fabric masks prompted the Foreo team to an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa beauty gadget that possesses positive features of masks and is devoid of their shortcomings.  After four years of development, the company presented a device in the form of a washer, or a flying saucer.  In honor of the last "smart mask" and got its name - <b><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-ufo/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dforeohabr">UFO</a></b> . <br><br>  What does the smart mask do?  In short: allows you to distribute useful serum over your face with maximum efficiency.  To enhance the effect of the impregnation components, the gadget heats and cools them, and highlights and massages the skin itself.  It turns out the spa procedure at home. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ae/pa/h-/aepah-hrkhq2gdp3bfhdfjtm5dg.jpeg"><br><br>  Serum applied to fabric "mask".  Yes, they have not gone away, but have decreased to the size of a large cotton disk.  This consumable is fixed on the gadget ring.  There are several types of masks: day, night, for oily skin, for moisturizing, for lightening, for the skin around the eyes, and collagen (anti-aging). <br><br>  At this point you should mention a smaller version of the UFO called <b><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-ufo-mini/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dforeohabr">UFO mini</a></b> .  A small ‚Äúplate‚Äù does the same thing as a large gadget, except for cooling.  Therefore, UFO mini is not compatible with eye masks and oily skin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tt/1k/qp/tt1kqp5wofmzag1_iaf-08bauvi.jpeg"><br>  <i>Foreo UFO mini smart mask</i> <br><br>  The mask connects to the smartphone via Bluetooth and works with the same application as the LUNA fofo brush.  First you need to get the wet consumables from the bag and fix it on the gadget.  Then - scan the bag to set the desired setting.  After that, it's time to start the procedures.  You can do without a smartphone and repeatedly press the button on the gadget, but then what's the fun? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bi/hj/xg/bihjxgm3pgewayizwbxyrdrb1dm.gif"><br><br>  The procedure consists of two or three phases, depending on the type of mask.  The first phase usually vaporizes the skin, the other two - activate the components and soothe the skin.  But this is in terms of the gadget.  The user simply turns on the UFO and drives the device for 90 seconds in the face. <br><br>  Heating occurs in the range of 20-50 degrees.  Increased temperature opens pores and increases blood circulation.  What Foreo calls ‚Äúcryotherapy‚Äù is cooling to a maximum of 4 degrees.  It is used only in two masks for the effect of tightening the skin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mw/o8/kl/mwo8klwsjn2grr7ydrkx1ioaofs.gif"><br><br>  LEDs under the UFO mounting ring may seem frivolous, but light therapy is actually used in cosmetology.  The whole thing in the spectrum: blue kills bacteria and helps fight acne.  Green removes pigmentation and the effects of premature aging of the skin, evens and brightens the tone of the face.  And red - improves blood circulation, stimulates the production of collagen and elastin. <br><br>  The UFO vibrates in much the same way as LUNA brushes.  Vibration is not configured in any way and turns on automatically.  It enhances the absorption of the components of the mask, but it seems that its main meaning is to give pleasure to a light massage of the face. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-g/14/mm/-g14mmqmvhlvhqnmngwq3rmohaq.jpeg"><br><br>  Cases "smart masks" are protected from water.  Gadgets from built-in batteries work, each charge is enough for 40 procedures. <br><br>  Both smart devices launched on Kickstarter in early 2018, the campaign raised $ 1,572,093 dollars.  Serious success is due to Foreo's reputation and the viral fame of its previous gadgets. <br><br>  Apparently, the backers trusted the Swedish inventors for good reason, dozens of laudatory comments were made about the ‚Äúsmart masks‚Äù of the UFO.  The point is the speed of the effect.  Positive consequences from the use of a new cosmetic product are visible after a month of use, not earlier.  Only allergic reactions are fast when the face turns red and peels off at the first touch.  And UFO does many things at once with skin and immediately, so that changes are felt after the first procedure. <br><br>  In the world of facial care this happens rarely.  Reasonable restrictions exist: a smart mask will not destroy acne and the scars from them; there is no magic.  But, if you wake up after a merry feast and treat your face with the help of a UFO, then the appearance will noticeably change for the better. <br><div class="scrollable-table"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="3">  Comparison of UFO and UFO mini masks </td></tr><tr><td>  Title </td><td>  Ufo </td><td>  UFO mini </td></tr><tr><td>  The size </td><td>  72.5 mm x 31.4 mm </td><td>  72.5 mm x 31.4 mm </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight </td><td>  146.2 g </td><td>  100 g </td></tr><tr><td>  Material </td><td>  Silicone PC / ABS </td><td>  Silicone PC / ABS </td></tr><tr><td>  Frequency </td><td>  180 Hz </td><td>  180 Hz </td></tr><tr><td>  Noise level </td><td>  ~ 50 dB </td><td>  ~ 50 dB </td></tr><tr><td>  Session duration </td><td>  90 seconds </td><td>  90 seconds </td></tr><tr><td>  Vibromassage </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Thermotherapy </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Cryotherapy </td><td>  there is </td><td>  Not </td></tr><tr><td>  LED therapy </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Nutrition </td><td>  Battery Li-Ion 1050mAh 3.7V </td><td>  Battery Li-Ion 1050mAh 3.7V </td></tr><tr><td>  The number of sessions on one charge </td><td>  40 </td><td>  40 </td></tr><tr><td>  Standby mode </td><td>  180 days </td><td>  180 days </td></tr><tr><td>  Charging time </td><td>  2.5 hours </td><td>  2.5 hours </td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><h3>  ISSA Toothbrushes </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yl/ap/fd/ylapfdgyv1_drqsgtv4pqflpshc.jpeg"><br>  <i>Toothbrushes Foreo ISSA</i> <br><br>  In 2014, Foreo broke into this new market with a serious offer - the ISSA series of sonic toothbrushes.  Their heads can be changed once a year, and the brushes themselves charged every six months.  Long-lived heads were made of silicone, so beloved by the company.  Silicone bristles do not harm the gums, and due to the absence of pores, colonies of bacteria do not breed in them. <br><br>  The Swedes first presented the gadget at the CES 2014 exhibition of innovative technologies, and then launched a crowdfunding campaign at Indiegogo.  The gadget has collected about $ 80,000, which is very good for a toothbrush. <br><br>  The second generation has changed somewhat, since the main heads have become hybrid.  Along the edges of the brush are silicone bristles that do not harm the gums.  In the middle, instead of them, bristles of rigid PBT-polymer are inserted for more effective cleaning of the deposit.  But the service time was reduced by half: these heads recommend changing every six months.  Silicone heads are still sold as they are well suited for sensitive teeth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cb/_j/yz/cb_jyz_vy-jgjr24i4yq9xs8z9k.jpeg"><br>  <i>Foreo ISSA 2</i> <br><br>  The <b><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-issa-2/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dforeohabr">ISSA 2</a></b> brush comes with a hybrid head.  Her work time, according to the manufacturer, is up to a year on a single charge.  It depends on the intensity and frequency of cleansing;  To save battery, the brush turns itself off after 3 minutes. <br><br>  The brush is sonic, not ultrasonic, since its vibration frequency is 11,000 movements per minute.  This is enough to clean your teeth.  Every 30 seconds a brush with a short vibration reminds that it is time to clean the other quarter of the mouth.  After two minutes, the indicator light will come on, indicating that you can finish brushing your teeth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ca/-_/1w/ca-_1waxvq-hvge59gijtyfizky.jpeg"><br>  <i>Foreo ISSA mini 2</i> <br><br>  The peculiarity of ISSA 2 is that its head is very large.  For those who need a smaller brush, <b><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-issa-mini-2/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dforeohabr">ISSA mini 2 is</a></b> better suited.  Unlike the ‚Äúbig‚Äù version, the brush has no intensity settings.  But there is a reminder that you forgot to brush your teeth.  After 12 hours, a sad LED smiley will light up on the handle of the gadget without brushing your teeth.  And when you have just completed your morning or evening toilet, ISSA mini 2 will ‚Äúreward‚Äù you with a cheerful emoticon. <br><br>  The cleaning process is exactly the same on a timer.  The battery should last for 8‚Äì9 months. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://madrobots.ru/p/foreo-issa-play/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dforeohabr">ISSA play</a></b> is the most democratic Foreo brush.  It is disposable, its head does not change, but it costs much less than similar devices.  It is comparable in size to ISSA mini 2 and has a hybrid head made of PBT polymer and silicone.  The brush works from two AAA batteries, which are enough for 6 months of work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g9/0h/vd/g90hvdbdjd6u5kuveifiri5e8us.jpeg"><br>  <i>Foreo ISSA play</i> <br><br>  The device was conceived as a test for those who do not know if he wants to use an electric toothbrush at all.  In addition, the small size and lack of charging make it a good travel accessory. <br><br>  Interestingly, all ISSA models have the same ‚Äúfuturistic‚Äù design.  So futuristic that such a toothbrush was used during the filming of the series Star Trek: Discovery.  The very continuation of the legendary show greatly disappointed hardhearted fans, but the brushes really deserve a place on the spaceship. <br><div class="scrollable-table"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan="4">  Foreo Sonic Toothbrush Comparison </td></tr><tr><td>  Title </td><td>  ISSA play </td><td>  ISSA mini 2 </td><td>  ISSA 2 </td></tr><tr><td>  The size </td><td>  159 x 30 x 24mm </td><td>  184 x 37 x 76.4 mm </td><td>  195 x 32.4 mm </td></tr><tr><td>  Weight </td><td>  61 g </td><td>  57.7 g </td><td>  67.8 g </td></tr><tr><td>  Head material </td><td>  PBT polymer / medical soft silicone </td><td>  PBT polymer / medical soft silicone </td><td>  PBT polymer / medical soft silicone </td></tr><tr><td>  Handle material </td><td>  Silicone / Plastic </td><td>  Silicone / Plastic </td><td>  Silicone / Plastic </td></tr><tr><td>  Speed </td><td>  9000 pulses / min </td><td>  9,000 pulses / min </td><td>  11,000 pulses / min </td></tr><tr><td>  Intensity levels </td><td>  one </td><td>  one </td><td>  sixteen </td></tr><tr><td>  Timer </td><td>  Not </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Tongue scraper </td><td>  Not </td><td>  there is </td><td>  there is </td></tr><tr><td>  Frequency </td><td>  216 Hz </td><td>  180 Hz </td><td>  166 Hz </td></tr><tr><td>  Run time per charge </td><td>  Up to 6 months </td><td>  Up to 265 days (8.8 months) </td><td>  Up to 365 days (12 months) </td></tr><tr><td>  Service time of one replaceable head </td><td>  Does not change </td><td>  6 months </td><td>  6 months </td></tr><tr><td>  Noise level </td><td>  ~ 50 dB </td><td>  Unknown </td><td>  50 dB </td></tr><tr><td>  Nutrition </td><td>  2 AAA batteries </td><td>  Battery, 420 mAh </td><td>  Battery, 420 mAh </td></tr><tr><td>  Charging time </td><td>  - </td><td>  1 hour </td><td>  1 hour </td></tr></tbody></table></div><br>  You can purchase Foreo gadgets at Madrobots.ru online store.
