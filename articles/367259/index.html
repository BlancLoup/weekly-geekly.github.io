However, the echoes of the harsh 90s that came to my school years, partially plunged me into the already ending golden age of IT, when I got into the hands of a motherboard with a Ti486DLC-40 processor, 8 megabytes of memory, a multi-card, a sound ESS1868, 170 MB megabytes ... and black a white Hewlett Packard monitor, managed by some Oak video card with a huge 256 kilobytes of memory.  I got a book on dosu and wrap everything up ... <br><br>  And 15 years later, while sorting out in the closet, I unexpectedly came across a completely unusual find, which in the very distant 2009 I was presented by one remarkable person ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is a mini Carry-1 computer with an AMD Am386SX-33 processor, an IIT 3C87SX-33 coprocessor, a built-in video from Trident with a breathtaking megabyte of memory, and of course, a bottomless 2 megabytes of RAM (which saddened me later on, putting an end to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpunching up Windows 95 / 98 / NT). <br><br>  It looked like this in the original, like this (the photo is not mine):

Another approach to searching for ancient parts revealed to the light that my first hard drive Quantum Prodrive LPS of 170 megabytes miraculously survived, and suddenly for me an extremely unusual relic that saved me at the beginning of the distant 2000s - a 5-inch 4.3 gigabyte Quantum BigFoot CY hard drive (with a 300 megabyte zone spilled into the bed). <br><br>  Old Quantum: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef8/774/a53/ef8774a539e0451fbd73af840200ae83.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unusual Bigfoot: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97e/010/152/97e0101527a44fb3a9488a8722717858.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To assess the differences: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd8/d85/e80/cd8d85e80cde467a8784b400323408d8.jpg"><br><br>  As it turned out later, the 170-megabyte disk did not survive numerous moves, having met its next inclusion with the horrific sounds of a streak of deformed positioners, which saddened me extremely. <br><br>  The next sticking point was my lack of a keyboard with an AT interface, but an old PS / 2 keyboard found in the bins of the motherland, a piece from an old AT-PS / 2 adapter and a soldering iron with Google solved the problem. <br><br>  Next was the non-working native Epson drive, which reads floppy disks once and in general, periodically stops responding to external stimuli.  He was promptly replaced by his more modern fellow from mitsumi, which, however, turned out to be larger and did not allow the hard drive to physically fit into the case (although due to the death of a standard-sized screw, this was not so important). <br><br>  Next, I had to tinker with the creation of a bootable (or as they used to say ‚Äúsystem‚Äù) diskette with dos.  At the time of the current general domination of NT systems, the sys c: a command: for many (including the OS itself), this is an overwhelming spell.  I was saved by VirtualBox with MS-DOS 6.22 installed and a floppy disk drive stuck on it.  A little later, on a couple of the remaining floppy disks, I uploaded the main distribution of the dos. <br><br>  And here is the first boot and bios, quite colorful.  By the way, in those days it was very fashionable to make colorful multi-colored interfaces: my old 486 even had a separate BIOS option that allowed you to choose interface color schemes.  Extremely fun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/131/e82/4b8/131e824b81a94ef8884714a49caacc52.jpg"><br><br>  As we can see, problem 2000 is irrelevant.  Already had time to forget, but in ancient times, the BIOS did not know how to automatically configure the disk and had 46 (in this case) standard disk settings and the 47th version for manual configuration.  His and choose, first asking Google to find us the specification of our fossil bigfoot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fad/49c/ee7/fad49cee7dd64a66b59e1f19442fa7c9.jpg"><br><br>  reboot and ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20f/533/ede/20f533ede16b4bc5aaa6afbcf715c947.jpg"><br><br>  PS: It is clear that ‚ÄúNumeric processor: None‚Äù - for some reason, by default, it stands in the BIOS as Absent.  After changing to Present, everything returned to its place. <br><br>  We quickly transfer the most necessary software of the 90s.  Unforgettable Commander Norton: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09c/765/973/09c765973ced40449a253fca1d568464.jpg"><br><br>  And what does he think of us: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c81/6fe/bff/c816febff2e54d3a92955afdcbb963a4.jpg"><br><br>  Known utility of those times: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/656/4d3/2a4/6564d32a4e2941cb8938682426f222bd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/378/347/03e/37834703e8504f60b7e4e79cd02ec22b.jpg"><br><br>  Very fast! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e2/d0d/48a/4e2d0d48ac844524a3b418fd1cc70d2f.jpg"><br><br>  Remember the button to clean the disk in Windows (hurried with a screenshot, about Windows a little later)? <br><br>  Point ‚Äú8‚Äù is particularly pleased, pay attention to the list of found files: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c2/f9b/506/3c2f9b506011487dbd173627b902c6a6.jpg"><br><br>  In order not to bother a dozen diskettes, I uploaded the Windows 3.11 distribution kit to the disk directly and entered setup.  My God ... this installer lived to XP! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1df/3aa/eab/1df3aaeabfdb45c58fa13e1c049ed2dd.jpg"><br><br>  In the process: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6b/693/950/d6b693950f5e44149fbcf0bb36d80fb1.jpg"><br><br>  I deliberately kept the old ISA network card with BNC-AUI-Ethernet ports for such a case, but it touched somewhere when moving, so for now the searches will be unsuccessful: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b4/ef2/feb/7b4ef2feb5dc488da7325e695283ef71.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, yes, the serial number, I did not even know about the existence of such a question before Win98. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/de6/41b/91d/de641b91dbd44037af62fdc64890c2de.jpg"><br><br>  Go! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ea/313/e74/0ea313e74ad240099e928a4955627f44.jpg"><br><br>  I really wanted to play Doom, but 2mb is unfortunately not enough for him. <br><br>  The next step will be an attempt to connect to the Internet through a com-port, as soon as I get the necessary pieces of hardware.  Also now I‚Äôm looking for a Linux distribution that can climb 2 megabytes of memory and want to do Qemm and still run doom (can anyone know if qemm can help me?) <br><br>  Here, while at the moment everything. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367259/</a></p>
