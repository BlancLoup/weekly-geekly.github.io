  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft: Russia is ahead of the US and Europe in the implementation of artificial intelligence</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Microsoft Corporation today <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/ru-ru/business-leaders-age-of-ai/">published the</a> results of an analysis of the processes of active implementation of artificial intelligence in the United States, Russia and Europe.  As it turned out, the Russian Federation reached the highest rate in this work among all the countries participating in the survey.  The average result in the world is 22.3%, in Russia it was 30%, that is, a third of Russian companies are actively introducing artificial intelligence. <br><br>  According to Microsoft experts who presented the Business Leaders in the Age of AI study, Russian leaders are using business intelligence more actively than their foreign counterparts.  If we take the average rate of introduction of AI in 22.3%, as already mentioned, in some countries it is much lower than the average value - for example, in France it is only 10%. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition, the authors of the survey believe that Russian leaders are more practical in the use of AI in business than foreign colleagues.  Experts have identified the following as the main priorities for the use of AI: <br><ul><li>  setting the right goals (32%); </li><li>  development of business ideas (26%); </li><li>  identification of new market opportunities (25%); </li><li>  decision making (23%). </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/abb/335/c85/abb335c852647b70f297456823c32dcf.jpg"><br>  Directors of Russian enterprises ranked second in terms of a positive attitude towards AI.  About 73% of managers believe that technology will positively influence their management activities.  Directors of domestic companies have demonstrated a higher willingness to learn and develop new skills in the field of AI.  90% expressed a desire to get the support of professionals in order to work better and more efficiently with the new technology.  On average, the world, the figure is 67.3%.  In addition, 30% of domestic managers are willing to allocate time to adapt to new working conditions.  On average, the world figure is lower - 20.3%. <br><br>  Russian company executives are responsible for the introduction of technology.  More than 65% believe that the responsibility for the ethics of the use of AI lies with the company's manager.  The same point of view in the world holds 53.9%.

      ‚ÄúToday, one of the main qualities of a manager is the ability to change and adapt to the new realities of the market.  Artificial intelligence as a technology has enormous potential for business, and anyone who earlier than others will begin its meaningful implementation will certainly gain a competitive advantage, ‚Äùcommented Dmitry Khalin, technical director of Microsoft in Russia. <br><br>  800 top managers from France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Russia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States took part in the survey (sample - 100 respondents per country).  Considered large companies with a staff of more than 250 people.  The study was conducted from January 18 to January 27, 2019. <br><br>  As for the most actively developing areas of AI, the online edition of the AI ‚Äã‚ÄãIndex helps to determine them.  It has been analyzing various trends in the development of artificial intelligence for more than ten years, proposing to use the number of scientific publications to evaluate the most active trends.  We are talking about articles in peer-reviewed scientific journals that are devoted to the issue of AI.  According to the <a href="https://vz.ru/society/2019/3/5/963688.html">latest</a> AI Index <a href="https://vz.ru/society/2019/3/5/963688.html">report</a> , the most active areas are machine learning (approximately 33,000 publications for 2018), then neural networks (over 30,000 publications) and computer vision (25,000 publications). <br><br>  It is worth noting that the majority of publications are not from Russian scientists.  The leader is the European Union (about 17,000 publications), then China (approximately 15,000 publications) and the United States (about 10,000 publications).  Perhaps the problem with the assessment is that AI Index evaluates, mainly, English-language scientific journals, and many Russian scientists post articles in Russian. <br><br>  If we talk about patents, then from 2013 to 2016, as many inventions in the field of AI were patented as patents were obtained in 60 previous years.  But patents are not the main indicator, because technology companies can patent something simply to improve ‚Äúpatent statistics.‚Äù <br><br>  The general trend in the introduction of AI in business solutions is visible to the naked eye - technology is gradually becoming an integral part of many digital solutions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/442730/">https://habr.com/ru/post/442730/</a></p>
