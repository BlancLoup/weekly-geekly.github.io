  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Autodial: Good and Evil</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We must admit that our <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iptelefon/blog/348300/">previous material</a> , to put it mildly, did not produce a furore.  Firstly, the topic is so toxic for Russian realities that all the participants in the discussion naturally tried on the result of the work of such a tool for themselves, and in the very application where the auto redial looks like a means of almost aggressive flooding.  Moreover, it is not necessary to imagine anything: almost everyone has the experience of such a ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù impact.  Secondly, stubbornly pretend that this is almost an innovative, independent tool in marketing and sales definitely not followed. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f58/0c1/b62/f580c1b62a38a31404eee74e2098132e.jpg" width="600"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, modern Automated Dialing Systems is just a refined, good old auto redial from the 80s of that very last century.  Yes, due to the fact that the tool was transferred to the software environment, it became more intelligent, for example, there appeared such a variety as Predictive dialer - but ... However, we refrain now to refer to some new evidence of the process technology, while the whole idea continues to look like a devilish typewriter hands of scoundrels. <br><br><h2>  Everything has its place and time </h2><br>  In fact, none of the respondents who hotly responded to the article, in our opinion, look like those who should have been on the list of this ‚Äúcalling machine‚Äù.  In our view, the Auto-Dial in the commercial field is for the most part a tool for automating communications in B2B sales.  This is the first.  And secondly, yes, we, of course, support the fact that the country has effective working legislation on regulating the relations of consumers and sellers using automatic redial, as in some countries.  Thirdly, we agree that outbound sales have long since begun to give way to the scale of new types of buyer-seller relations and technological means of inbound sales.  But for the time being, in B2B they somehow refuse very little.  And this may seem surprising, but a lot is still being decided on the phone.  "Stakeholders" and people who make decisions, for example, in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãbuying and selling businesses, are not all ready to even arrange a meeting by means of a message in the messenger. <br><br>  We are talking about increasing the productivity of sales, when there is a business process that attracts dozens of requests through the same digital marketing, and there are confirmed phone numbers of decision-makers in businesses who themselves are waiting to be contacted for consultation.  And there is a seller who spends 15 minutes out of 60 minutes of time directly on negotiations, the rest on dialing, searching and entering information in CRM, carrying calls due to busy people at the other end and re-dialing ... Why not make life easier for everyone?

    <h2>  Addition, not the main tool </h2><br>  Ideally, efforts in ‚Äúoutgoing sales‚Äù should be complementary to the well-tuned process of ‚Äúincoming sales‚Äù, and it is clear that not in any industry.  The seller in such an organization is not engaged in the primary lead generation activities, but appeals to companies that have already received some individual information, at least there are strong assumptions that for this particular company the seller has value in the form of a new product (version) or service and it is possible to establish contact with decision makers in this field <br><br>  Of course, the rules of good tone, taking care of your own image and respect for people with whom you may be built as a result of long-term relationships will require the correct timing of the call and the right script, where you first need to make sure that the addressee is comfortable and he generally ready to listen to you.  But in practice, of course, often the software systems for automatic mailing and auto-dialing ‚Äúcharge‚Äù the databases purchased anywhere and launch such a ‚Äúsuccessful innovation sales process‚Äù. <br><br>  Among our customers who use autodial functionality are companies that process up to hundreds of applications per day from businesses whose representatives previously want to discuss some of the individual parameters of their request before switching to a formalized document exchange mode and passing the procedure for signing contracts and ordering.  We will not argue that automatic redial for them is the main tool of work.  However, when there are a lot of applications, the call center gets the opportunity to quickly and efficiently communicate with the leads, fixing the necessary information in CRM. <br><br>  We encourage you to consider auto dialing as a possible element in a wide range of strategies and tools, which can serve to a greater extent as a means of optimizing the work of operators / sales, rather than being considered a sales tool.
