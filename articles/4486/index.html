  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How many good cards we have ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Have you ever dealt with corporate systems?  One of the main problems for the sake of which they are embarking on long and extremely expensive projects for the implementation of complex industrial solutions like Sun Identity Manager or various ERPs - data fragmentation: for example, information about user login-password-groups is stored in Active Directory, management data is in 1C , plus access system, accounts in any electronic trading systems, etc.  The same thing is happening with information about orders, stocks, etc., etc. ... The consequences are clear - data entered in one place reaches other systems (if they do), with deceleration and changes are often made manually.  In small companies, these problems are solved due to the fact that ‚ÄúVasya already remembers everything‚Äù and everything in sight, the big ones - regulations, procedures and expensive projects for the integration and implementation of various solutions. <br><br>  The starting point is clear - the data stored in one system must be accessible from the other, otherwise their inaccessibility is in fact equivalent to the absence.  The inaccessibility of data reduces the freedom of users and developers, reduces the effectiveness of the IT structure as a whole. <br><br>  A global approach to solving such problems across the Internet seems somewhat ... utopian, however, we also saw similar projects - remember, at least MSN Passport.  Many companies launched less ambitious solutions within their services - Google Account, Yandex.Passport and many others perform the same functions.

      However, let's finally move on to the cards, for good reason this word is in the title.  It seems that now no search portal can be considered as full-fledged, if it does not have a map service.  Well, of course, Google has, MSN has, Yandex has, Rambler has, even RBC has!  Recently, Mail.Ru has its own map. <br><br>  There are many maps, but in most cases the basis of domestic map services is the same.  For example, Yandex and Mail.Ru use the same source cartographic data from <a href="http://www.resident.ru/">the Resident company</a> , ‚Äúspecializing in Geographical Information Systems (GIS) since 1993‚Äù.  However, the interfaces are slightly different.  Decide which one is better, which one is worse for users.  Personally, I like Yandex better; there, at least, you can copy the link to a specific map fragment. <br><br>  One of the methods to increase the utility, and hence the popularity of such a service, is to saturate the map with additional data.  About the building of the palace to tell its story, put a link to the corresponding site, link a link to its repertoire to the building of a cinema, etc.  It is both useful and interesting to users and can generate income.  Examples of this approach are quite numerous now: there is a project <a href="http://adresa.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Adresa</a> , developed jointly <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/">by Yandex.Maps</a> and <a href="http://yp.ru/">Yellowpages.ru</a> , where address information is supplemented with data on firms.  Mail.Ru is going to integrate maps with its other services - <a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/">Afisha@Mail.Ru</a> , <a href="http://afisha.mail.ru/">Travel@Mail.Ru</a> , etc.  RBC is trying to create a loyal community of users, who will take care of filling the card, as part of its <a href="http://mos2.ru/">MosDva project</a> ( <a href="http://www.ajaxplanet.ru/mosdva-nu-i-esche-odna-karta/">see review</a> ).  Well, the idea is quite in the spirit of Web 2.0. <br><br>  All this is good, but the trouble is that our developers do not allow users to create their own applications based on their maps: there is simply no open API to do this.  And numerous examples of using maps from Google or MSN do not inspire them.  A pity ... I have one strange hobby - I like to ride roller skates.  In the past 2 years, not so often and fanatically, as before, but still.  So, at one time I <a href="http://rollerpiter.ru/forum/index.php%3Faction%3Dvthread%26topic%3D258">really wanted to make an asphalt quality map</a> . <br><br>  The quality of asphalt is a critical factor for a roller, this idea appeared to many and constantly stuck with the fact that there simply were no easily accessible map data and interfaces for working with them.  What is the benefit of an accessible API for developers, but what is it for the service hosts?  I am ready to use a similar service if advertisements will be attached to this map.  Perhaps I would just be glad to know that a new cafe or shop opened next to my route from work home.  The theory is simple - give the mechanisms to use your card, I, in turn, will provide visitors who can show ads.  Openness promises big enough benefits, but also requires a different level of preparation: security, documentation, developer support, add.  server power ... The main problem that will become in Russia in the way of such services is the relative small number of potential add-on service developers and their users.  Investments may turn out to be more profitable ... It can be even more interesting for us - remember the <a href="http://www.ajaxplanet.ru/nuzhna-li-reklama-v-fidah-runetu/">technology of contextual advertising in RSS, which the Runner has developed</a> : there is technology, but users are not ready yet.  So it turns out that today the St. Petersburg asphalt map is most conveniently done using ... a service from Google or Microsoft.  Most likely Google - there is a Russian-language map.  Although, let's say honestly, in terms of functionality, <a href="http://local.live.com/">live.local.com is</a> richer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4486/</a></p>
