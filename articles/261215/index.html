My name is Oleg, I am the project manager of Mail.Ru for Business.  It so happened that we regularly <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/223667/">talk</a> about changes in the service in Habr√© in order to get feedback from you on how to improve the product (the ‚Äúwishes‚Äù of habrayers are marked in our backlog with a separate tag). <br><br>  Continuing our good tradition, we give any habraiser an opportunity to try our service in action.  In the comments under this post, you can write that you want to try "Mail.Ru for business", and we will send you a promotional code for a free domain with a connected service.

      Here is the most important thing that we managed to do lately: <br><ul><li>  online office document editor </li><li>  DNS hosting </li><li>  admin levels </li><li>  two-factor authentication </li><li>  new user creation interface </li><li>  block users </li><li>  synchronization with Active Directory </li><li>  Exchange Migration: Closed Beta Testing </li></ul><br>  And now about all this - more. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  Online Office Document Editor </h1><br>  The Mail.Ru for Business package has an online editor for documents, spreadsheets and presentations that is integrated into the Cloud.  We see that this functionality turned out to be especially important for corporate users. <br><br>  It happens that on the road or on vacation you need to urgently edit the contract, correct the table with the budget or change a couple of slides in the presentation.  And you only need a couple of changes, but as long as you download the file, until you open Word or another necessary program (which may not be on the device at all) ... Now for this we have an online office document editor, which can be used directly from the web interface Mails and Clouds. <br><br><h1>  DNS hosting </h1><br>  Since the launch of the project, DNS hosting has been one of the most popular queries - and now we have one!  We have implemented the ability to transfer to us free of charge DNS records of any domain and put care of their hosting on Mail.Ru servers.  First of all, this is economical - after all, some domain registrars provide the same service for money (you can transfer to us from paid hosting by saving domain DNS records).  Secondly, it is convenient, because it is possible to manage from one interface not only mail, but also the necessary DNS records, eliminating the need to contact the registrar once again.  And thirdly, this is the easiest way to connect a domain to us and set up mail.  Enough to register new NS-servers, and you do not need to spend time on the rest of the settings that are required for a normal domain connection to Mail.Ru for Business, such as changing MX and SPF records, DKIM-signature settings.  Everything will happen automatically.  Manage DNS-records can be directly in the admin mail. <br><br>  You can delegate an already connected domain to <a href="https://biz.mail.ru/">biz.mail.ru</a> in the administration interface in the ‚ÄúDNS hosting‚Äù section of the menu.  To connect a new domain via DNS hosting, enter its name on biz.mail.ru and select the tab "DNS Transfer". <br><br><h1>  Admin Levels </h1><br>  Another very important opportunity is the separation of levels of administrators.  It allows the business owner, on the one hand, to delegate part of the duties, on the other hand, to be sure that the employees, having obtained admin rights, do not break the firewood - for example, they will not remove all other administrators. <br><br>  So, we have two new admin levels: <br><ol><li>  <b>"Domain Administrator"</b> - allows you to manage all users, but does not allow inviting and deleting other administrators. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúGroup Administrator‚Äù</b> - these access levels can be set to the heads of departments: the head of the administrative department will manage his subordinates, and the head of the sales department - his own. </li></ol><br>  You can change the current role of the administrator in the "Administrators" section on <a href="https://biz.mail.ru/">biz.mail.ru.</a> <br><br><h1>  Two-factor authentication </h1><br>  No matter how complex the protection for the mail we have come up with, the weak point is the password - it can always be ‚Äúled away‚Äù.  For this, alas, there are quite a few methods: viruses, brute force and so on.  Breaking mail, in any case, is an extremely undesirable thing and often has unpleasant consequences.  But if, in the case of a personal account hacking, a user loses, for example, a game account or access to an iPhone, then the ‚Äúprice‚Äù of hacking a corporate mailbox is significantly higher - after all, the work of the entire company can be paralyzed.  Therefore, two-factor authentication, which we implemented at the beginning of this year to increase the security of mailboxes, is especially useful for our corporate users.  In our implementation, the second factor is the code sent via SMS to the phone number connected to the account.  So we recommend that anyone who uses Mail.Ru for business and has not yet configured two-factor authentication, do this. <br><br><h1>  New user creation interface </h1><br>  To work with the service has become even easier and more convenient, we have updated the most important interface of our system - the form of creating a new user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/747/782/c98/747782c98c204f6d92c1aa4bf157d6b0.gif"><br><br>  As part of the update, we also added an important feature that simplifies the life of administrators: you no longer need to invent strong passwords, the system will generate them automatically. <br><br>  Immediately after creating a new user, you can send him to the old mailbox all the necessary data: the name of the new mailbox, password, address to log into the account. <br><br><h1>  Lock user </h1><br>  Many managers found themselves in a delicate situation (for example, when an employee was dismissed) when it was necessary to promptly close access to the information stored in the box and to the address book.  To do this, in the ‚ÄúMail.Ru for business‚Äù interface, you need to select a user and click the ‚ÄúBlock‚Äù button opposite him. <br><br>  If this is not about a ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù mailbox, but about an account that is ‚Äútied‚Äù to a specific position (for example, sales@greatstartup.ru), the administrator will be able to block access for the former employee, and after changing the password, open access for the new employee with preservation of archive of correspondence and the address, habitual for clients.  Thus, the new sales manager will immediately get access to the correspondence and the database of clients who have gained his ‚Äúpredecessor‚Äù. <br><br><h1>  Synchronization with Active Directory </h1><br>  Many companies connected to Mail.Ru for Business use Active Directory to store information about all employees.  For them we made a special application for synchronization with the Active Directory database.  It allows you to automatically create accounts in the corporate mail when you add them to the database, as well as create all users in the domain in one click. <br><br>  In winter, we conducted a closed beta test of this application, and the second version was launched quite recently, so we will be happy to receive feedback.  Download the application and learn more about how it works, you can <a href="https://biz.mail.ru/ad">here</a> , and share your impressions of the work - in the comments or on <a href="">o.parinov@corp.mail.ru</a> . <br><br><h1>  Exchange Migration: Closed Beta Testing </h1><br>  And finally, the feature we are working on right now.  We talked a lot about the fact that Mail.Ru for Business provides a simple and understandable migration procedure that allows you to transfer mail from any service that supports POP3 and IMAP (by the way, as our internal statistics show, about a third of all comes to us).  However, until recently, we did not have migration from Exchange.  Considering how many users want to switch from Exchange to a free solution, we decided to fix it and announce the start of a closed beta test of the new functionality - transfer of mail from Exchange to Mail.Ru for Business.  We will be grateful to everyone who will help make this process as simple and convenient as possible.  To take part in the PTA, you can leave a request on the <a href="https://help.mail.ru/biz-support/exchange">link</a> . <br><br>  So, here is the most important thing that we managed to do lately.  Once again I remind you that we are distributing domains for free to Habr's users with the connected Mail.Ru for Business service - so that you can try it in action and tell us about your impressions.  The first one hundred people who left a request in the comments will receive a promotional code for registering a free domain in the .ru zone with a connected mail service (with the ability to change the A-record). <br><br>  PS And we also made a special promotional version for those who are tired of all sorts of new-fashioned parallaxes and flat-design, but want to know what Mail.Ru is for business.  A small hint: this is the case when you are not ashamed to use the help :) command <a href="https://biz.mail.ru/terminal">https://biz.mail.ru/terminal</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261215/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261215/</a></p>
