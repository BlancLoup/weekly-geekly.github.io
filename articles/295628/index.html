  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hello, SaaS | Clinical to Patient Communications at Dental Cloud</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, our colleagues discussed what SaaS 2.0 will be like.  A curious and logical hypothesis happened - in the front end b2b systems, the de facto standard would be to provide the user with all types of communication with his client.  The time is coming ‚Äúmulti-channel communication of software‚Äù.  In <a href="https://dentalcloud.pro/">Dental Cloud,</a> we are well aware of and implement all possible clinic-patient communications today.  Links to the same discussion of SaaS 2.0 at the end of the post for the curious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/370/e92/65e/370e9265ea294140bcde8935da36d08f.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Today we have implemented the following communications</b>

      <u>Form on the website of the clinic with the possibility of making an appointment.</u> <br>  The form represents a line of code that must be installed on the clinic's website.  After installation, a VitJet appears on the website with an image of all the doctors and the patient can make an appointment at the website itself.  The administrator of the clinic in a separate window of the site sees all applications that automatically fall into the calendar of visits and the schedule of doctors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/765/552/63e/76555263e5214fd39b039ea796972d71.png"><br><br>  <u>SMS patient alert</u> <br>  This is a simple and customizable tool that will help reduce the number of pending visits.  Within several hours the patient will receive sms on his smartphone with a reminder of the visit to the clinic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71e/0c3/a4a/71e0c3a4a0244cacbfac96ee128515e2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>What are we doing</b> <br><br>  <u>Virtual PBX with <a href="https://voximplant.com/">voximplant.com</a></u> <br>  In the near future, <a href="https://dentalcloud.pro/">Dental Cloud</a> will become a full-fledged virtual PBX.  The clinic staff will be able to make outgoing calls from the browser, and the administrator will receive incoming calls using a SIP softphone or hardphone.  Dialing up to the employees will be possible via the call forwarding function to the extension number, just like on a regular phone.  Calls between employees within the system will be free.  Accordingly, the clinic management will not need to install an office PBX - Dental Cloud will be able to completely replace the standard telephone infrastructure, which will save tens of thousands of rubles.  The key advantage of using the Dental Cloud telephony module: all calls are recorded in the system, including incoming unpleasant ones.  Such accounting will help to organize the control of business processes in the clinic - to understand whether there are missed and unanswered calls and how actively the administrator communicates with clients.  Tariffs for using the built-in module of calls are lower or comparable to bills for regular communication, while there are no capital costs for organizing communication. <br><br>  <u>Communication and information via messengers</u> <br>  If we talk about the prospects for the development of Dental Cloud, then in the future it is planned to implement the ‚Äúdoctor-patient‚Äù communication through messengers in two modes: notification and consultation.  These communication channels tomorrow will be the most common and will replace sms. <br><br>  <u>Communication via related services</u> <br>  Dental Cloud is an accounting system that integrates with services that position themselves as marketing tools to attract and retain patients.  One of these services is <a href="http://medicalapps.ru/">medicalapps.ru</a> .  It helps the clinic to get new patients through linking the clinic to the location on the map, as well as the ability to review all the specialists of the clinic and make an appointment.  Through the application you can organize communication with the doctor and view the medical card.  Thus, the clinic receives an additional channel to attract patients, and the bundle as a whole is shifted in positioning towards the marketing tool. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f3/e80/36e/7f3e8036e37d492982dbb48c4fc3ebab.jpg"><br><br>  <u>Personal account of the patient</u> <br>  One more step to bring the patient closer.  In future versions of Dental Cloud, we will attach importance to ensuring that the patient of the clinic has constant access from any device to information about the current status of treatment, the financial component of treatment, and the history of treatment. <br><br>  <b>Values ‚Äã‚Äãof communication</b> <br><br>  <u>Benefits of integrated communications in Dental Cloud:</u> <br>  ‚Ä¢ All communication tools in one environment: calls from the browser, automatic reminders, the site integrated with the Dental Cloud. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Control of business processes - calls are ‚Äútied‚Äù to the employee and patient, hence the absence of missed calls and accounting for staff development. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Personalization of communication - the choice of communication options with each patient, where all the preferences of the patient are realizable. <br><br>  <u>What the clinic gets when using the communication component of Dental Cloud:</u> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Multiconality of communication with the patient. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Unloading staff.  For example, 15% of patient records occur through the clinic site, the number of incoming calls is reduced accordingly, and the staff is unloaded. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Reducing the number of pending visits due to reminders. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Increased loyalty to patients - the patient himself can choose the appropriate channel of communication for him. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Economic benefits.  The head of the clinic translates capital costs into operating expenses, the cost of ownership of the clinic office is reduced. <br>  Well, in general, you can earn money on external integrations. <br><br>  <a href="http://rusbase.com/opinion/saas-future/">Link to a discussion of the issues of SaaS 2.0</a> <br><br>  Previous author's materials <br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Megamind</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Habrahabr</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295628/</a></p>
