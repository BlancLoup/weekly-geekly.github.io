      On March 17, Brad Fitzpatrick and Dmitry Vyukov from Google, Jessie Frazelle from Microsoft and not only will perform in Moscow.  There are already 11 selected speeches in the program, which we will discuss in detail under the cut, and you can still offer your report to the <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/MjQsdpDjXHWpWybr2">CFP</a> before January 20. <br><br>  There will be two parallel streams, simultaneous translation in both directions in the main hall, fiery afterparty, steep activities from our partners (hello to you from Gett, JetBrains and Google).  We are waiting for 400 participants, <a href="http://gophercon-russia.ru/"><b>join you</b></a> ! <br><br>  <b>So, what's in the program:</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rq/ud/_b/rqud_b-q-vvjch0ykioggocfqwu.jpeg" align="left" alt="image">  <b>Dmitry Vyukov</b> , Google.  The creator of the race detector and execution tracer in Go, the author of many improvements to the runtime language.  I put my hand to the support of parallelism and multi-core: parallel garbage collection, gorutin scheduler, channels, synchronization primitives, etc. <br>  <b>The subject is specified</b> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tk/jv/78/tkjv78_06lnzvksc7z_wn2py-hi.png" align="left" alt="image">  <b>Jessie Frazelle</b> , Microsoft.  Works on supporting Linux and containers in the Microsoft ecosystem.  Former Maintainer Docker, contributor to RunC, Kubernetes, Linux and Go. <br>  <b>101 Ways to Compile a Go Binary</b> <br>  If you‚Äôre a little bit different, you‚Äôll find out where to go. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gq/2w/ja/gq2wjab7jknd8ljel2hcfjfv7bi.jpeg" align="left" alt="image">  <b>Brad Fitzpatrick</b> , Google.  Go team member, author of many standard library network packages.  Previous creations: LiveJournal, OpenID, memcached. <br>  <b>The subject is specified</b> <br><br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oo/ll/m0/oollm072dfprmz6q9u6ke1qzfug.jpeg" align="left" alt="image">  <b>Marco Kevac</b> , Badoo.  System programmer, specialist in high-load services.  Thanks to his products, millions of people around the world have found their soul mate. <br>  <b>Introduction to the s2 geo-library from Google and examples of its use in Badoo</b> <br>  Taxi services, social networks, games, maps - they all regularly collect and process the location of users.  Marco will introduce us to one of the libraries for easy work with coordinates.  Consider the main examples of its use, learn how to use it in high-performance services on Go and hear what s2 is used in Badoo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/be/ab/jx/beabjxqif_orcxbfd3nxegqlvrc.jpeg" align="left" alt="image">  <b>Alexey Akulovich</b> , VKontakte.  Backend developer, engaged in "deep back" and the project infrastructure.  Promotes Go both inside and outside the company. <br>  <b>Networking Go</b> <br>  Consider options for working with HTTP, TCP, UDP as from stdlib, and some third-party solutions.  From high-level to direct siskol and their options.  There will be code examples, implementation comparisons, mandatory benchmarks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/mz/cz/aamzczped2tht42pn5c8thyvctq.jpeg" align="left" alt="image">  <b>Andrey Smirnov</b> , Virtustream.  Development manager, developer, fan of Go, Python, DevOps and heavy loads.  Today he is developing an exabyte cloud storage facility. <br>  <b>Creating an effective statsd client library</b> <br>  Step-by-step story about creating an effective (both in memory and in CPU) client library for the statsd protocol.  As in the case of statsd, aggregation is performed on the server side, the application sends metrics to statsd at a very high speed, several metrics for each measured action.  The monitoring library should not be a bottleneck and should not have a significant impact on application performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bl/-k/-4/bl-k-4952furxrw2ui81-6xc88e.jpeg" align="left" alt="image">  <b>Stanislav Afanasyev</b> , Juno (Gett).  He worked in game development, hardware, social networks and analytics, he was familiar with Java, Perl and Ruby.  For two years, he has been developing high-load backends on Go in Juno, namely geo-services and implementation of algorithms. <br>  <b>We write our own cryptocurrency on Go</b> <br>  Stas will write proof-of-concept cryptocurrencies and in practice will show how cryptocurrencies work under the hood: generating wallets, creating a transaction on one side, turning on the transaction in the block and confirming this block by the miners, receiving this transfer on the other side, etc. .  We will focus on how Go falls on this case - its pros, cons, existing solutions and libraries, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ff/et/of/ffetofgvbv3op-vtdwlb9fibdgy.jpeg" align="left" alt="image">  <b>Grigory Eleskin</b> , Mobalytics.  Playing games, he manages to do cool things in the field of gaming analytics.  While no one sees, is engaged in reverse game protocols and recreates their server part in the form of emulation. <br>  <b>Go: pros and cons on the background of the language Pony</b> <br>  Let's talk about the main advantages of Go and compare it with the Pony language - the main future competitor in the recycling of multi-core systems.  Let us understand what cons Go has acquired due to the direction of easy learning of many employees in the company and maintaining the overall style of the code during development.  And find out what advantages can be obtained in the future from Pony, which is developed taking into account the experience of Go / Erlang / Scala in the aggregate of ideas based on actors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qo/ai/mk/qoaimkeaiev7h4q4wrexo4ozppy.jpeg" align="left" alt="image">  <b>Sergey</b> Kamardin, MailRu Group.  Works in the mail team.  Engaged in the development of messaging services between mail systems and end users. <br>  <b>Restarting Go applications gracefully</b> <br>  What is a graceful restart?  What is it for?  How does it work on Linux?  How to implement it on Go?  How is the possibility of graceful restarts dependent on the protocols?  Let's talk about this and some of the wrapper processes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yb/9n/rc/yb9nrcp1ylc-gqywmsngealdqti.jpeg" align="left" alt="image">  <b>Alexey Naydenov</b> , ITooLabs, CEO.

These scripts are written in the language embedded in the platform - Javascript implementations.  Discuss why embed an interpreted language in a product on Go, how to link it with the Go performance model, how to embed interpretable tasks in a cluster for scalability, and more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ba/nt/aw/bantaws-pvkrgupny8sa36_zxcq.jpeg" align="left" alt="image">  <b>Andrey Minkin</b> , Mad Devs.  Timlid, loves Go and writes on it for more than 3 years. <br>  <b>Backend on Go + grpc in production for mobile applications</b> <br>  Report on grpc on real case - alternatives, rakes, benefits, exploitation.
