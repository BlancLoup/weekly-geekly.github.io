Only the term is longer and the amount too. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is a loan?  According to the apt national expression, "you take strangers for a while, and you give yours forever."  That's right: in the current consumer lending schemes (including mortgages), the bank pays for me to someone who sells some goods to me, after which I pay the bank.  In the scheme, there are sometimes mortgage brokers, credit experts and other okolopaschayuschiysya people who exploit the general lack of literacy of the population in the matters of filling out papers and the legal basis for lending. <br><br>  However, making money on ignorance is normal, here everyone is responsible for himself.  Do you want to pay?  - go learn <s>Albanian</s> materiel: legislation, rules, arithmetic and economic terms.

      So, the bank gets into my pocket and turns it into a source of its regular income.  Well, this is the job of the bank - to make money spin.  But why, then, are cases of lending scandals becoming more frequent? <br><br>  1. Banks hide information.  Understand the pile of paper, and the contract, which podosyvaet bank - very hard when you can not see the scheme from the inside.  I tried, and, despite the legal background, I did not understand much.  I did not encounter such difficulties even when I understood cryptography!  RSA and Elliptic Curve Public Key Encryption - Serious!  - simpler than the scheme for calculating interest under a consumer loan agreement. <br>  <b>And I never sign contracts that I could not understand.</b>  <b>This is a way to voluntarily give oneself in bondage, because ignorance does not exempt from liability for obligations</b> . <br><br>  2. Banks do not work with the client.  Try to change the loan agreement - at best, you will be denied politely.  And they can get nasty, referring to the fact that ‚Äúthis type of agreement is an agreement of accession and it cannot be changed!‚Äù.  I wonder how it turns out: I have to pay for what is profitable for the bank, but I cannot lay my own benefits.  This is a <b>bad deal</b> . <br><br>  3. Using financial illiteracy, banks gain their income from consumer lending at the expense of ‚Äúhidden payments‚Äù and complex formulas laid down for calculating interest.  Moreover, the vice is very tight: delayed the payment?  - fine.  Payment is not entirely?  - fine.  Early payment?  - fine. <br><br>  This is a personal example: my relative took a loan for kitchen appliances and furniture.  They <b>even called</b> from the bank <b>with threats</b> !  I had to intervene and explain to them that they, in doing so, are seriously at risk - I write a similar conversation on tape, and even in the presence of a notary - and the bank manager at best gets off with a large fine in my favor, bank issue.  What-what, and the court is not in the interests of the bank. <br><br>  How many papers do you need to collect in order to get the desired property in the mortgage?  That's it.  This time spent is also worth the money.  Therefore, I would rather hire an intelligent lawyer from realtors, to whom I will explain what I want, and let him work - it will cost me less: in the time I save, I will pay less than I earn in the same time. <br><br>  But not a mortgage broker!  - these guys, if not on the side of the bank, then certainly not on mine. <br><br>  However, I will take a loan.  But not consumer!  And one that will allow me to earn more than I will pay on interest.  So far there are no such offers on the credit market.  And 40% is too ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3981/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3981/</a></p>
