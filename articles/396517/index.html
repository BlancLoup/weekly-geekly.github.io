  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HyperX Cloud Drone - decently does not mean expensive</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi GT!  More recently, I <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/278974/">told</a> you about the flagship headset HyperX Cloud Revolver, everything is fine in it ... except for the price.  No, it costs its money, but not everyone has the opportunity to pay 10-12 thousand rubles for "headphones with a microphone."  Today's post is about another headset, which occupies the opposite position in the HyperX Cloud lineup.  The Drone model is the ‚Äúentrance ticket‚Äù to the world of comfortable communication and online battles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2cc/536/32b/2cc53632bef8df980aa7bbef5fceb181.jpg"><br><br>  And if after reading the post you can find a better option for that kind of money - I will have to eat my hat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  The most important </h2><br>  In the last post, we already talked about what is important in a gaming headset: clear sound positioning (especially when it comes to shooters), ‚Äúnormal‚Äù frequency response in terms of frequency response, comfort and lightness, reliable construction and good noise-canceling microphone.

      To provide all this and a comfortable price is quite difficult.  Of course, the first thing under the knife will go premium materials, decorations, packaging and assembly complexity.  The simpler the product will be in the end, the greater part of its price can be given directly to the audio path: speakers, microphone, high-quality soldering, wiring, good wires.  You can call me Cap as much as you like, but here the logic is simple and it is easy to trace it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4d/b61/9fc/b4db619fc1e8ac4c05292b356be408da.jpg"><br><br><h2>  HyperX Cloud Drone </h2><br>  The required minimum is seen in everything.  Packaging - a simple cardboard-plastic blister with an empty molded plastic inside.  Completion - a leaflet with basic information, headphones, extension cable.  Everything. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/94d/e7a/cac/94de7acac601aa77ad2b0d125bd60cf8.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Construction and materials </h4><br>  The headphone case itself is completely made of plastic: a sliding headband, a cup of speakers, a hinge connecting them to the headband ... To be honest, at first glance, the design looks frighteningly fragile.  But if you look at the details more closely, you will notice that the tips of the plastic parts are specially maximally elongated and distant from the attachment points.  The bending forces will be evenly distributed over the headband and will not break the screws out of the plastic threads.  The headband is adjustable on the flight: up to 4 centimeters on each side, in increments of 0.5 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff2/e26/088/ff2e26088111e8c52365a90367cdd808.jpg"><br><br>  Cups speakers mounted on a hinge with two degrees of freedom.  The adjustment angles are not the biggest, the headset does not fold into a ‚Äúrecumbent‚Äù position for carrying around the neck, but there is enough reserve for a comfortable position on any, even the reptilian head itself. <br><br>  The microphone and the wire are on the left, both are inseparable, on the right cup there is a built-in volume control.  The speakers are 40 mm, with neodymium magnets inside.  The wire is the most common, in a fabric braid, with a four-pin connector on the end.  Length - meter.  Included is an extension cord by two meters, ending with two standard mini jacks.  With this connection, the headset is suitable for lovers of laptops, and for PC users, and for console gamers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ed/1d4/78e/8ed1d478ef113601d8156945a1f37a9c.jpg"><br><br>  Microphone - capacitive (electret), on a flexible rod, folding, the mechanism is combined with a switch.  You don't need a microphone (well, as it happens: the mother came into the room, asked the small one what she didn‚Äôt do, and the party members are laughing at you) - they picked up the microphone and no sounds would go anywhere.  A click between the on / off positions feels great, inadvertently turning off the microphone or turning it on will not work, decent force is required. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/176/65b/269/17665b2696a3ce2b4c3eb83cb8a9be97.jpg"><br><br>  The sensitive element itself - narrowly targeted, with passive noise cancellation and competent protection against "blowing out" - you can even sit opposite the fan, but nothing will go off the air except your voice.  Sensitivity is not bad - you can talk in a quiet and calm voice, while the explosive "P" and "T" will not be felt by the interlocutors, like a headset. <br><br><blockquote>  Note  Author: <i>I have SS Siberia Elite Prism, and so ... their fan blows out.</i>  <i>And the voice on them all my life was like from a toilet.</i>  <i>: - \ But the backlight is configured ...</i> <br></blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/225/051/0b9/2250510b966efd019659e9f17f8dd1d5.jpg"><br><br>  Ear pads made of leatherette.  It is simpler than on models of Cloud X or Cloud Revolver, but the filling is completely the same - material with a memory effect, it remembers the shape of the head when heated and returns the original one when it cools.  Ears do not sweat, outside noises are well cut off, the headset does not press on the head, what else is needed for happiness? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b47/bcb/4d5/b47bcb4d57b1cf9c6db2a99c319eb70e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Sound </h4><br>  Frankly, there was a surprise waiting for me.  From such a compact headset with a small amount of resonator available to the speakers for any miracles in the reproduction of sounds, I did not expect: in the end, the manufacturer itself positions this thing as a Pro Gaming Headset. <br><br>  On a neutral equalizer, the music is frankly ‚Äúflat‚Äù, the sound is too dry and absolutely inexpressive.  I would call this sound (not in terms of quality, but in terms of atmosphere) acceptable for ‚Äúmonitor‚Äù headphones: it‚Äôs appropriate for their status.  With a flat EQ on the field and tediousness HyperX Cloud Drone can compete with the Fostex T50 RP. <br><br>  But with the appropriate settings ... audiophilism will not work, but just listen to the music - completely.  The speakers lack some sharpness of sound, fast guitar riffs barely noticeably ‚Äúeat up‚Äù and sound a little dirty, but this is just a contrast effect: in everyday life I use much more expensive headphones and I have something to compare with.  Oh yes, I also recommend slightly expanding the stereo base by turning on the appropriate setting in the player. <br><br>  If you take any classmates in a similar form factor, the sound can be called "at the level."  There are low frequencies, medium ones are well divided, the tops are OK.  The only thing I wrote above, without an equalizer, listening to music is simply unbearable.  Affects sharpening the game.  But in the games ... It's all gorgeous. <br><br>  Yes, the sound is flat, and artistic explosions and shots from any artillery sound different from the movies, but ... enough to understand what is happening.  But the shots are perfectly audible from everything that is smaller, and even with a clear sense of the direction of the sound.  Perfectly audible steps and jumps.  In terms of shooters (CS, BF, ARMA, Day-Z) everything is fine.  In addition, you will always perfectly hear the party members, the headset transmits their voices cleanly, loudly and clearly.  Here, rather, a question to their microphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/935/4f3/a7a/9354f3a7a3abed4cbc0530e06ccb6c10.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Microphone </h4><br>  There is not much to say.  Electret microphone, condenser, narrowly targeted, with noise cancellation.  It works perfectly, it turns off with one movement, it does not catch breath, it transmits voice to five plus.  Nothing better in terms of the microphone in this price segment, you just will not find. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f41/5dd/313/f415dd31359f847810916b7f9878ff64.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Specifications </h4><br>  If anyone is interested in digital characteristics, here they are: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">"TTX"</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  Headphones </h4><br>  <b>Speaker:</b> Dynamic, 40 mm; <br>  <b>Type:</b> covering, closed type; <br>  <b>Frequency response:</b> 20-20000 Hz; <br>  <b>Resistance:</b> 24 Œ©; <br>  <b>Sound pressure level:</b> 94 ¬± 3 dB SPL / mW at 1 kHz; <br>  <b>Nonlinear distortion factor:</b> &lt;2%; <br>  <b>Input power:</b> nominal 20 mW, maximum 100 mW; <br>  <b>Weight with microphone and cable:</b> 220 g; <br>  <b>Cable length and type:</b> Headset (1 m) + PC extension cable (2 m); <br>  <b>Connector:</b> Headset - 3.5 mm plug (4-pole) + PC extension cable - 3.5 mm stereo and microphone plugs. <br><br><h4>  Microphone </h4><br>  <b>Element:</b> Electret condenser microphone; <br>  <b>Pattern:</b> Unidirectional, with noise reduction; <br>  <b>Current consumption:</b> &lt;500 ŒºA; <br>  <b>Resistance:</b> &lt;2.2 kŒ©; <br>  <b>Operating voltage range:</b> 1‚Äì4.5 V; <br>  <b>Frequency response:</b> 50‚Äì10000 Hz; <br>  <b>Sensitivity:</b> -45 ¬± 3 dBV (0 dB = 1 V / Pa, 1 kHz). <br></div></div><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f10/893/68e/f1089368e0f4c6abe936fcbfa4119358.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Worth every ruble </h2><br>  So, we have reached the most interesting.  Since August 15, HyperX Cloud Drone is available exclusively <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesDrone">in the DNS at a price of 3,990 rubles</a> .  For this money you get an ultra-light (220 grams) gaming headset with a stunning microphone.  Great sense of direction of sound, well-thought-out design, a microphone that does not transmit everything that is happening outside your window, even if you communicate in a whisper at night. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ae2/0eb/8be/ae20eb8be8ad36a9733bf90a7eaf2e8f.jpg"><br><br>  In terms of audio quality, of course, it will be slightly inferior to ‚Äúmusic‚Äù headphones in the same price category, but, once again, this is a gaming headset with appropriate sharpening. <br><br>  If you open Yandex.Market, put the price "up to 4.999" in the filters and start looking for wired headsets there, you will be shocked.  Either non-directional microphones on the speaker cup, or some kind of misunderstanding on the wire.  Strange form factors, glossy cases, a bunch of reviews with one star and "broke after 2 months."  The closest at least some decent option among popular models - Razer Kraken Pro costs ... from 6 to 7 thousand.  In the same price segment, and SS Siberia v2 / v3 / 200. True, they still have a dynamic microphone (rather than a condenser microphone), and for that kind of money you can already take the HyperX Cloud Core, which makes the Krakenov in all stats, and costs a little less. <br><br>  Well, if you play honestly, put the filter "up to 4000", and look at the most popular models - then there is nothing but how to cry bitterly (after all, until August 15 there is still a week to wait) and there is no more.  And after the fifteenth, you can safely go to DNS for the <a href="http://hyperx.gg/GeektimesDrone">best gaming headset up to four thousand rubles</a> .  I have it all.
