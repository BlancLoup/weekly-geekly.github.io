Therefore, we are experimenting with the formats of productions: user expectations, briefs, functional requirements, so-called technical tasks, and so on. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, now it seems to us that for small sites with an emphasis on content two documents are enough. <br><ol><li>  Questions grouped by visitor roles. </li><li>  Life situations, grouped by the same roles. </li></ol><br>  With these two lists, it is already possible to continue to write content, select functionality, design, impose, adminit a bit, shamanize and run a little. <br><br>  It is possible to draw designer beauty, too.  But we are not on this part, so we will not give a tooth.

 Do not need to make this answer brighter?  How?" <br><br>  On life situations - and even easier: ‚ÄúImagine that you are in this situation.  What will you do on the site? ‚ÄùIt may be more correct to call these situations user scenarios, but this is more of a place for a boring holivar than a significant question. <br><br>  The main magic, of course, is that the lists are both quite voluminous and quite compact.  That is, all the specialists who work on the project physically deal with two pieces of paper, and not with a pile of waste paper. <br><br>  This dramatically increases the readability of the discussion.  Yes, and evade important requirements are now more difficult.  Yet in plain sight, it is difficult to cut the corner and convince yourself that you can not do a specific page - the user's question will remain unanswered then, and it is easy to notice.  You can't fool yourself when the list of requirements fits into one sheet. <br><br>  The second half of the magic is that nothing else is needed.  Absolutely nothing.  Especially do not need multi-volume technical specifications with passages like ‚ÄúWWW - the World Wide Web‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe site should work in browsers A ‚Äì B ‚Äì C ‚Äì X‚Äù. <br><br>  Most of all we like to compare with these lists when deciding the question ‚ÄúIs it necessary to create such a page or implement such a functional‚Äù. <br><br>  Well, in the second most popular place - the situation "Let's understand, is a good site or a bad one."  Considers situations and answers questions - good.  Ignore - bad.  Plus, it is immediately clear what and how to fix it. <br><br>  Of course, we love and know how to write honest user scripts, work out user profiles, build an object ‚Äì information model, draw a customer journey map and juggle with some OLAP ‚Äì cubes of requirements.  But all these stories are quite expensive for web projects.  And when it is possible without them, we try without them. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/217771/">https://habr.com/ru/post/217771/</a></p>
