You will learn from today's article.  Yes, sir, have to read.  Of course, it will be interesting. </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/77f/9ef/6d8/77f9ef6d8b5d47b4a99dddc4593ffe2d.jpg"><br><br>  Without an abundance of theory and complex statistics, in this article we will talk about how to form a ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù, principles of business projects, motivation for development and the dark side of cookies.  Only real examples of companies and personal experience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Every person faced a low ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù, whether it was an insult to a courier who brought cold pizza, without even putting a couple of napkins (!) To order, or to a partner company that was breaking the deadlines for providing the page layout of the site.  The fact is that the name of the company is built on such details, and you, as a client, were dissatisfied with the result. <br><br>  Even if large companies sin by periodically turning a blind eye to the need for timely improvements and innovations, is it worth talking about companies with a small budget?  Although, without improving the product, without expanding the range of services and without developing its business, focusing on the needs of customers, the risk of being burned out and not earning the desired millions is very great.  And what could be sadder for the company than the lack of net profit?  If you dig deeper, it becomes clear - problems begin with terminology. <br><blockquote>  Customer service is not only the personal contacts of consumers with the service department.  This is the level of development of the company, including its positioning in the market, multiplied by the attitude to current and potential customers.  The result of the customer service can be called the company's reputation. </blockquote><br>  Take internet marketing.  In 2006, the first online chat rooms began to gain popularity (thanks to ‚ÄúWebim‚Äù).  This system turned the understanding of what level of feedback a company should provide on a website.  Chats provided a ready-made solution that does not require additional resources for development and implementation, setting a new standard for receiving feedback from customers online: personalized handling, convenient data entry and the speed of receiving responses from managers.  But a few years later there was an explosion of foundations: the first <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3Dspark.ruClient%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">widget of the callback</a> appeared and took away part of the market. <br>  This is one of the many examples of how a business project went bankrupt due to a cursory study of the market for the relevance of a similar service, the lack of developing a better version for its customers. <br>  <i>Read more about the death of chat in the blog " <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/carrotquest/blog/13960/">Carrot quest</a> ".</i>

      If you give the leading position to the competitors for a couple of months nothing good, but terrible, it will not happen.  Worse, if the firm persistently does not notice or reject the innovation, promoting the convenience of an outdated model to the end. <br>  Funny  But after all, most do so, because  It is unrealistic to develop a product cheaply, but to constantly invest part of the profits in analysis and development is difficult, apparently psychologically. <br><br><h5>  <b>Catch if you can.</b> </h5><br>  Briefly squeezing the results of the Zendesk study will help you look at your business in another way: <br><ul><li>  All research participants believe that the quality of service plays a key role in forming opinions about the company. </li><li>  66% of clients from the B2B sector and 52% of clients from the B2C sector refuse to cooperate with a company that is unable to provide a decent service. </li><li>  72% explained their dissatisfaction with the need to explain the essence of the problem to several people. </li><li>  45% of dissatisfied and 30% of satisfied customers share their experiences on social networks. </li><li>  39% are not ready to contact a firm that did not provide quality service, even after two or more years. </li></ul><br>  You probably noticed how easily a number of banks lost their clients when in 2005 Tinkoff took the stage.  He came to the established market, using email distribution to distribute his credit cards, serving clients through telephone and Internet only.  Offering convenient card design, cashback and high interest rates, he was able to lure a large audience. <br><br>  Consider: <i>Tinkoff's customers are customers of other banks that they simply could not keep</i> . <br>  Without proper work with clients, you can assume that you do not have them.  Constantly remind yourself of this. <br><br>  Another <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2015/08/05/pomoshnik-site-anons.html">example</a> , ‚ÄúApple and Google are developing a unique assistant who can predict the user's desires ‚Äî the information he wants to request.‚Äù <br>  Google and Apple anticipate expectations by constantly searching for ideas and creating opportunities.  They cannot be late and, if something has appeared on the IT market, they will soon have their own version of the service, but better! <br><br>  At one time, we saw Clicktex, a feedback button for the mobile version of the site.  Having studied the demand for such a service on the market, having learned the opinions of our customers, we began to work on a better version.  Having released ‚Äú <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3Dspark.ruClient%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">Easycall</a> ‚Äù in April, we successfully hit the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/cashmyvisit/blog/16800/">Mobilegeddon</a> wave (Google announced that sites with a mobile version would be ranked higher in search results), which helped advance the B2B market. <br><br>  Over the next 4 months, competitors began to think about the need for such an option for their services.  The reason was the recognition by customers of the effectiveness of the product. <br><blockquote>  ‚Äú57% of smartphone users call after searching for information.  In RuNet, 70% of sales occur through calls, ‚Äùsays Yevgeny Vlasov, CEO of Calltouch. </blockquote><br>  The funny fact is that within 3 months only 2 companies could satisfy this request.  Think "only 2 companies", taking into account the abundance of competition in the market kolbek. <br><br><h5>  <b>The dark side and cookies.</b> </h5><br>  A significant number of companies are called shareware services, providing consumers with basic functionality at the lowest price, sometimes even for free.  We have been taught since childhood that there is no possibility in the world to get a high result for free, everyone knows the phrase ‚Äúfree cheese is only in a mousetrap.  Then what's the catch? <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b06/a7d/4eb/b06a7d4ebf9448c2b559001ee8c5cbba.jpg"><br>  Without paying for the service, you get a low-quality product, compared to other market offers, with a slow speed of development and implementation of technologies that increase efficiency, or without them at all.  Shareware companies at low prices give low conversion.  You save costs by allowing you to experiment on the result, which in the future will still require costs.  A reasonable question arises: why pay more?  :) <br><br>  We were taught by our own experience that a bias towards price is always a minus in conversion and visitor convenience, which means less profit for the company.  Why? <br>  Consider an example.  In the window of many callback widgets, after hours, the client is offered the choice of a convenient time for connecting with the manager on the basis of the company's work schedule.  In our service, by default, the call is transferred not to the first working hour, but to 3 hours of work, if the client did not enter a specific request. <br><br>  We made this decision, because the collected statistics showed that <b>87% of</b> site visitors do not choose the time, they just press the confirmation button, because they want to get a call as early as possible.  The widget processes all incoming user requests, distributing them one by one, so that the flow of accumulated calls to the manager‚Äôs number is not simultaneously merged. <br>  These little tricks lead to a higher conversion, and it is with such details as the unobtrusive provision of the desired service and time for a morning cup of coffee to the visitors for the partner company manager that we provide ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù. <br><br><h5>  <b>So how can you not be dumbfounded in front of clients and how not to become ‚Äúinjured‚Äù yourself?</b> </h5><br>  Unfortunately, the ideal scheme does not exist and there is no solution, promising at minimal cost, the mountains of gold.  But there is a right direction that will work for you - the <i>development of customer service</i> . <br>  This is what the 5 reasons previously mentioned for reconsidering priorities in the choice of partners for cooperation and the principles of building your own business are reduced to. <br><br>  For example, having gained the loyalty of website visitors, you will be able to maintain the reputation of a reliable company that provides high-quality and timely <a href="http://cashmyvisit.com/%3Futm_source%3Dspark.ruClient%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3DCashMyVisit">feedback</a> .  With such details, you guarantee business longevity and prosperity. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e06/780/244/e0678024434045f488674aa7ef8f1da6.jpg"><br><br>  In the comments, tell us about your positive or negative experience in obtaining ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù.  How do you provide it to your customers? <br>  We will be glad to hear your opinion! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296762/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296762/</a></p>
