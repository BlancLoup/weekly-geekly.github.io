Today is the day of a PR specialist who has been celebrated in our country for the tenth year.  This is not a new profession, and it can be treated differently.  After all, like any tool, PR can serve for good or for harm.  But we tend to consider it a ‚Äútool of good‚Äù and use it only in a positive way.  As examples, we want to present you a selection of positive and original PR campaigns that were conducted on different sites. <br><br><h1>  TripAlertz </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efa/ed4/025/efaed4025901340d6cc83dc6fb6f7ab0.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The travel agency offered to vote for sending one of the celebrities into space on the Lynx Mark I spacecraft.

      In 2009, the world spread news about finding a person for the best job in the world.  They were offered a salary of $ 150,000 per year, the duties included: taking care of a tropical island, cleaning the pool, feeding fish.  As a resume, it was necessary to make a 1-minute video with a story about why you should get this job.  And that's all.  The campaign attracted about 7 million visitors to the official website, 34,000 applications from 200 countries were submitted.  The event was initiated by the Queensland Tourism Authority, Australia.  And this job <a href="http://blog.queensland.com/2013/03/21/how-to-get-best-job-in-the-world/">was received by</a> Ben Southall, who subsequently received a post called the Queensland Tourism Ambassador. <br><br><h1>  Like one ball </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa2/f17/38d/aa2f1738d777a705449242e737bd8e58.png"><br><br>  Brazilian division Heineken decided to increase the number of visitors to its page on Facebook.  To do this, they launched the campaign ‚ÄúOne Like - One Ball‚Äù.  When one of the visitors clicked on the Like button, Heineken employees blew one green ball in their office, the whole process could be watched online.  As a result, the room was soon filled with a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãballoons. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jw_OiEzH5j0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgV2GSO19ZT5kkzPkyAOMEz92n2Mw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h1>  Dwarf at the South Pole </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6c/dd8/301/f6cdd8301adcd86ec2ea8027c3b5b6f9.jpg"><br><br>  Kern, a manufacturer of precision laboratory equipment, decided to attract attention and strengthen its image in the scientific and educational sector.  For this, the campaign "Experiments with a gnome" was launched.  The site could request a set of figurines gnome and laboratory scales.  It was necessary to accurately measure the mass of the figures in different parts of the world and publish the measurement results.  The bottom line is that the gravity of the Earth varies depending on the geographic location of the observer.  Thanks to this campaign, the gnomes were noted even at the South Pole and in the hadron collider CERN. <br><br><h1>  Million dollar page </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/447/47e/02d/44747e02dd48b956b8079a01ddffdc56.jpg"><br><br>  Old, but very interesting and original project.  In 2005, an American student decided to earn money to pay for his studies.  To do this, he created a web page of 1000x1000 = 1 000 000 pixels, and invited everyone to place any images on the page.  The bottom line is that it was necessary to buy the required number of pixels (for $ 1 each, the minimum order is 100 pixels).  Less than six months later the page was completely full, and the author earned $ 1 037 100. <br><br><h1>  Jumping on the bed </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/198/c61/374/198c61374527866e5f7ab148e2b6a4b1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d6/6fa/648/1d66fa6489a5d6775feb11bf0a7bdc47.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f34/9c5/e9b/f349c5e9be90d7d845492a78f1b518f7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1a/49a/971/b1a49a971daf96b5b22be2b94208a6e3.jpg"><br><br>  At the height of the holiday season, one can not fail to mention this promotion.  Search service hotels HotelsByCity launched a separate page, where users publish photos in which they are captured jumping on the bed at the hotel.  What a sin to conceal, very many people like to ‚Äúgo flying‚Äù on a hotel bed, a lot of people are indulging in this.  So if you have someone at your side with a camera, then this is a great excuse to capture another memory of your vacation. <br><br><h1>  Top managers simpsons </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e8/419/2e1/6e84192e198df1b59104f7c71fef35f4.jpg"><br><br>  By April 1, on our corporate website, we redrawn portraits of top managers in the style of the Simpsons.  It turned out mentally.  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/37f/4c3/efd/37f4c3efd6dafe690ec6f8ce2dbd7e8d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d9/3ee/6ea/7d93ee6eab05bba416c3a054097ee186.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/579/a0c/6b3/579a0c6b323bc98f9416b699fcc934ae.jpg"><br><br>  We congratulate the PR people who are currently reading this collection doubly - you have a very interesting job.
