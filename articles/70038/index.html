As it turned out, the current president of the United States, Barack Obama, has the same :).  I will start, perhaps, with the appearance (below in the photo) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e83/9e3/605/e839e36056b5b449bd02b6aa29a299e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We immediately see that the device is designed for the corporate segment, strict forms, metal edging of the case, the back cover is trimmed with leather, which is very pleasant to the touch, plus a strict black color and a glossy display all this leaves the impression of a good and high-quality phone.  It is worth mentioning that in the complete set, and it was this I got, there are good headphones (3.5 mm jack), a charger, which pleasantly surprised with its replaceable plugs for different types of sockets, a CD with software and a cable for connecting to a PC, as well as a leather case, which bears the ‚Äúblackberry‚Äù logo.  The presence of the latter was pleased, since the device is not small (114 x 66 x 15, 136 grams) and it will not be possible to simply carry it in your pocket.  Let us proceed to the description of sensations when working with the device.

      I‚Äôll just make a reservation that for the last three years, I used exclusively Windows Mobile communicators equipped with touch screens, and so at first I felt some discomfort from not being able to just poke the screen with the stylus.  But the adaptation was surprisingly quick and painless, I was very pleased with the trackball, the devices in which it would have been qualitatively made can be counted on fingers and the BlackBerry also succeeded.  The trackball is the main element of navigation both in the menu and in the web browser.  The small keyboard also appeared to be convenient, and after some adaptation it was convenient for speed dialing sms and working with e-mail.  The last way was the goal of testing. <br><br>  So, what did I get by working with mail on Exchange from my communicator on my BlackBerry? <br>  As it turned out the results of this test drive a lot.  Firstly, the traffic is saved, the connection to the Exchange server is not directly, but through special BES servers and thanks to proprietary protocols, although the phone is always connected to the server, the traffic is minimal due to compression technologies, and messages arrive almost instantly.  Secondly, this is the convenience of viewing attachments, again, the server magically transmits to the screen only the necessary piece of attachments at the moment, be it a Word document, an Excel spreadsheet, or a photo. <br><br>  For example, I came up with a weighty table of 1MB in size from which I only needed one sheet, the smart server did not send it to me entirely, but just threw me that piece of attachment that I decided to see, given the recent brutal increases in GPRS traffic, the savings were significant .  Thirdly, the functions of remote work, synchronization of the address book, use of search by contacts in the corporate directory of the company and synchronization of the calendar all this greatly simplifies living outside the office, business trips and helps to keep abreast of events, even in a traffic jam on the way to work. <br><br>  Of the goodies of a communicator not related to work with mail, I would like to mention a very elaborate web browser that can easily replace Opera Mini, and given the presence of a trackball and, accordingly, a cursor for its ease of navigation, it is superior.  Also in the "blackberry" did not forget about the support of ICQ, Gtalk and the popular in the west of Facebook.  The built-in player produces quite a decent sound, and the standard headphone jack allows you to connect decent sound, especially since the power is enough to shake quite serious models. <br><br>  I was pleased with the function of recognizing the voice input of a phone number, unfortunately not Russified, unlike all the other functions of the device, but even my pronunciation was enough to dial numbers with a voice while walking along a noisy street.  A good integrated map service and GPS made it possible not to get lost in noisy Moscow. <br><br>  In general, the impression remained very pleasant both from the communicator itself and from its work as a client of the Exchange-mail service.  In terms of communications, the device was very pleased, it took into account everything that an office worker might need in our time, all functions for working with Exchange mail, support for instant messengers, GPS navigation, weather forecast, stock informers, viewing and editing DOC \ XLS \ PPT documents, Work with a convenient calendar, web browser that supports modern technology AJAX \ JavaScript \ CSS.  There is a player as audio and video, and even a set of several games.  By the way, for those who do not have enough built-in applications directly from the phone, a service is available for downloading ringtones, pictures of the desktop and applications similar to Apple's AppStore. <br><br>  UPD: comments indicated that no minuses are indicated.  So, I used it, as a corporate phone with a link to the corporate mail and with the exception of the price (around 22-25 tr.) I did not reveal any specific flaws. <br>  With the exception of the security-related peculiarity of using only allowed or closed wifi passwords (which was specified in the security settings), the device completely satisfied me. <br><br>  And the work time in the region of 2-3 days without recharging was generally very pleased, considering that I was very actively sitting on twitter, ICQ and listening to music. <br><br>  UPD2: photos of the animal <br><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Irq0xh7R0wo/SriDHR6w1-I/AAAAAAAAAJI/tZJGCG6PjkY/SDC11522.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_Irq0xh7R0wo/SriDHXCWHII/AAAAAAAAAJM/z9r97ovxyew/SDC11523.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_Irq0xh7R0wo/SriDHQhDrRI/AAAAAAAAAJQ/vRyERog2HEc/s576/SDC11526.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Irq0xh7R0wo/SriDHuVAQgI/AAAAAAAAAJU/Yprk-0PwLWQ/s640/SDC11529.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_Irq0xh7R0wo/SriDHlFwwWI/AAAAAAAAAJY/fJR2oYKji4M/s512/SDC11533.JPG" alt="image"><br><br><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_Irq0xh7R0wo/SriDODIZqMI/AAAAAAAAAJc/9epGTrJcxnE/s512/SDC11535.JPG" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70038/</a></p>
