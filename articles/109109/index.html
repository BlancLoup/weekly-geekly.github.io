  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PotokFM - monitoring of regional radio</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is an opinion that everything that got into the Internet remained there forever.  With broadcasting, the situation is reversed: in most cases, what was not heard went into oblivion. <br><br>  The impossibility of repeating or analyzing the content of at least yesterday's broadcast inspired the creation of a monitoring complex that would allow working with radio archives as with a regular database.  The difficulty lay not so much in the audio data format, as in the need for physical presence in each of the connected cities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/6070015b/eec27044/3ad7e0d1/542eef78.jpg"><br>  To implement such a complex, it was necessary to create a geo-distributed network of storages and teach it to work with sound. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To connect the city to the complex, a server is installed, the main task of which is to receive and analyze the broadcast of all FM radio stations in this particular region.  Having connected in a similar way 25 cities, we combine all the pieces of iron into a hardware-software complex with user access through the website.

      The output is an infrastructure that writes and stores the archive of the country's regional broadcasting, and allows you to work with it remotely in the future.  On the basis of such an infrastructure, it is possible to implement a number of interesting analytical and search services. <br><br><h4>  Ether Monitoring </h4><br>  The first and fundamental service is the Monitoring of Ether (ME).  Its task is to automatically analyze the air of a given radio station for inconsistent overlaps in regional broadcasting, as well as to determine the interference or silence. <br><br>  It is no secret that the content of the air of one radio station differs in different cities of its broadcasting.  Local news and broadcasts, weather forecasts, advertising grids, traffic jams and other blocks create a unique broadcast in a given city, and its uniqueness can reach 100% (24 hours).  As a rule, the schedule of overlappings is coordinated in a regional grid, but in practice it is extremely difficult to track its compliance. <br><br>  Users who have connected the ‚ÄúME‚Äù service get access to daily reports on the real situation in the region.  Any segment of the air, causing questions or requiring confirmation, you can request from the archive of the ethers and listen.  Thus, a tool is created to monitor and control compliance with agreements or fulfillment of commercial obligations. <br><br><h4>  HabrFM </h4><br>  For example, imagine that the Moscow Radio "HabrFM" opens broadcasting in Omsk.  Habrabossa and colleagues from Siberia vdali hand and agreed that on weekdays the regional grid of allowed ceilings, determining the value of the franchise, will look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b5475d9c/991be691/0687d53a/fbd70eb7.jpg"><br>  <i>Comment: everything that falls on the layer of the regional grid (yellow) can officially (but not necessarily) be covered with other content for the end listener.</i>  <i>The discrepancy of broadcasting outside the grid is unacceptable.</i> <br><br>  But the air day passed, and the real situation was different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/544eb45c/7f5486bc/b046a7bd/38be7e2a.jpg"><br>  <i>Comment: 2 hours 37 minutes 45 seconds (almost 11% of the air) - amounted to inconsistent overlaps on the air of "HabrFM - Omsk" for November 30.</i>  <i>Any of the segments of the sound can be requested from the archive and listen for confirmation.</i> <br><br>  During the period of overlap, Omsk students did not receive the content that the owners expected to convey to them, and no matter what it was: federal advertising, the announcement of the event or the speech of the president. <br><br>  In any case, there is a reason to talk, substantiate claims or other compensation measures, which will be used by the owners of HabrFM.  And it's not just about lost money.  In the long run, the image and security of the media business is much more important.  Efficiency and the absence of the human factor influence on reporting make the Monitoring of the Ether service a serious tool for managing regional media streams, especially with a developed regional network. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I can answer questions in the comments.  I do not give references, but for those who want to feel personally - I will provide free access to the system (contact your personal email).  I plan to participate in the weekend in Startup Weekend (Moscow). <br><br>  In the next part I will talk about the second basic service - ‚ÄúMedia Search (PM)‚Äù, which allows you to search for a given sound pattern in the archive and provide statistics on its rotations.  The service confirms outputs on the regional air of advertising, music and other content. <br><br>  Thank you, happy winter. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109109/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109109/</a></p>
