Then we want you to know: until January 27, 2015, you can take part in the contest ‚Äú <a href="https://kontur.ru/ib2015%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dibs2015">I am a Businessman</a> ‚Äù and with the help of your own brain and creativity win various useful pieces and 300,000 or 200,000. Rubles, not dollars, but not bad in light of the current economic situation. <br><br>  Why do we want to talk about the competition here?  At a minimum, IT people are people with brains.  Anyone who was able to launch his IT startup and put into practice an idea will be able to talk about his business interestingly. <br>  This is exactly what is required - to make a video about your business with the help of any technology.  The main thing is to keep within 3 minutes, and the business owner at least once appears in the frame. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The competition is held for the third year in a row.  Two previous times the finalists were determined by the number of votes collected in the Internet voting.  This time we decided to give more chances to those who deleted their accounts in social networks (accidentally or intentionally) or simply not a fan of crowdsourcing.  Winners in the main nominations will be determined in different ways: <br><ul><li>  if there is an interesting idea, you can count on 300,000 rubles in the nomination "Jury Choice".  Which movie will be chosen by experts and it is impossible to predict by what criteria.  They can encourage both the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãbusiness and the creativity of the author when creating a video. </li><li>  know how to get people to vote for their video?  Fight for 200,000 rubles in the nomination "Internet voting".  Friends, friends of friends, advertising in social networks - all honest ways are good.  But cheaters will be punished. </li></ul><br><br>  What else?

Your video will be watched not only by your friends and partners, but also by experts, young businessmen from all over Russia, and potential clients.  This is a real opportunity to expand your business, to find customers, franchisees, partners or just practical advice. </li><li>  In addition to the winners, there will be finalists and winners of special categories - all of them will not remain without prizes either. </li></ul><br><br>  If you are looking for ideas on where to get money for business development and what to do in the New Year holidays, this information should be enough for reflection. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246237/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246237/</a></p>
