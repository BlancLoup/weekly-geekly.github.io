  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A selection of high-tech fitness innovations on Kickstarter</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, on Kickstarter, several interesting new products have appeared, designed for athletes and anyone who seeks to lead a healthy lifestyle.  Among them are useful devices that monitor the process of training and the daily activity of their owner, as well as gadgets that help control their diet.  Today, <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/">Medgadgets Blog Shop</a> offers a small selection of unusual and functional devices that will make your sporting interest more exciting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/faf/639/c3d/faf639c3da5eb4f318adb501299816a4.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Goccia is the smallest activity tracker in the world: its weight is only 3 grams and less than 2 cm in diameter </h4><br>  The Goccia miniature activity tracker, which tracks the owner‚Äôs activity throughout the day using LED technology, attracts attention with its elegant appearance and versatility.  Compared with rather bulky trackers in the form of bracelets and key chains, which are inconvenient to use in everyday life, this miniature waterproof device the size of a shirt button (17.9 mm in diameter) and weighing only three grams does not create any inconvenience when it is worn.

The Goccia tracker can not only calculate the number of steps you take or the calories consumed, but also monitor your sleep mode, allowing the owner to analyze your lifestyle and make the required changes.  There are two main modes of operation - day and night, switching between which occurs automatically.  An interesting feature of the tracker is the presence of algorithms for various types of activity - for example, for walking, cycling, swimming, golf, tennis, etc.  An additional advantage is the possibility of wireless charging, with one charging device enough for 14 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/797/457/d89/797457d89bb9a6830503555792f0ac2b.jpg"><br><br>  Synchronization of data with a tablet or smartphone is not via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi, but through light pulses from the built-in LEDs.  As the developers promise, to synchronize the data, just put the tracker on the front camera of your smartphone.  At the moment, the device is compatible with gadgets on the iOS platform, in the future, its creators are planning to implement support for other platforms - Android and Windows Phone.  The required amount for the project is $ 50 thousand, while a little more than $ 35 thousand has been collected, the gadget is planned to be delivered this spring and summer. <br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1269010520/goccia-the-worlds-smallest-and-simplest-activity-t">Link to the project on Kickstarter.</a> <br><br><h4>  SITU - smart scales that determine the content of calories and nutrients in your food </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ddc/d96/d5e/ddcd96d5e5a83479486450eb7d72575b.png"><br><br>  The unique SITU smart scales automatically determine the calorie and nutrient content of the foods you consume based on their weight.  Through the Bluetooth interface, the device can connect to the iPad and display accurate information about your diet in a special SITU app, including data on calories, salt, sugar, vitamins and minerals.  Such a device will be extremely useful not only for those who follow the diet in caring for the figure, but also for those who are forced to control their diet because of the disease - for example, diabetics or hypertensive patients. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31c/76b/634/31c76b634b6e3fcd1f6e319c71344df7.png"><br><br>  For athletes, it will provide important information about the amount of protein in certain products.  There is a convenient opportunity to save the history of data about your diet.  In addition, the device is able to warn about the achievement of the established limits of calories, making power control simple and convenient.  The author of the project is a former Apple employee and journalist Michael Grothaus (Michael Grothaus).  For the first five days since the launch of the campaign on Kickstarter, the project has collected more than half of the claimed amount of 35 thousand euros.  There are 18 days left until the end of the fundraising campaign, deliveries are planned for November of this year. <br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/situ/situ-smart-food-nutrition-scale">Link to the project on Kickstarter.</a> <br><br><h4>  Insight - tracker for athletes, tracking the increase in lactic acid </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76d/af7/d25/76daf7d254d64f3449b63b99035c5101.jpg"><br><br>  The BSX Insight multifunctional sensor allows you to monitor heart rate, calories burned, movement speed, and also determines the anaerobic (lactate) threshold, thus replacing four specialized devices.  This is the first of its kind, equipped with the function of synchronization with ANT + and Bluetooth 4.0, which allows you to transfer data to a sports watch.  BSX Insight provides an opportunity not only to thoroughly control the training process, but also to manage it.  The sensor monitors the state of the muscles and, on the basis of the data obtained, gives out signals when it is necessary to add tempo and when it is possible to take a rest.  The ability to determine the anaerobic threshold is of particular importance - according to experts, after reaching this threshold, training becomes more effective.  BSX Insight is able to provide invaluable assistance both during training and at competitions, helping to adhere to optimal tactics to achieve the best result.  The project raised almost $ 122,000, with a plan of $ 50,000. <br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1655571865/insight-smarter-tech-for-the-smarter-athlete">Link to the project on Kickstarter.</a> <br><br><h4>  Hoop Tracker - the first smart watch for a basketball player </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bd/24f/2fb/2bd24f2fbaedff4c7a4c1c22a05e37b8.jpg"><br><br>  Another interesting gadget for athletes is designed specifically for basketball players.  Hoop Tracker is a smart sports watch that allows you to track the number of shots made, their accuracy, the number of misses, elapsed time and other parameters.  This is actually the first device that allows basketball players to track the growth of their skills and to identify points that require further improvement. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1d/953/28b/b1d95328b8c1c854c7ee19f0cfba38e7.jpg"><br><br>  The device weighs 65 grams and does not interfere with the game.  The built-in battery makes it possible to work autonomously for up to seven hours.  The device memory stores information about the last ten games.  Two weeks left before the completion of the fundraising campaign for Kickstarter, the project has already collected over $ 36 thousand. <br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hooptracker/hoop-tracker-basketball-shot-tracking-smartwatch">Link to the project on Kickstarter.</a> <br><br><h4>  XBand Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãPro - tracker for professional runners </h4><br>  Physical activity trackers, such as Jawbone, PUSH, iHealth, Bowflex Boost, Fitbit Force and others, allow you to count the number of steps taken per day calories, track many useful indicators.  But for professional athletes, in particular runners, this is not enough.  Fitness tracker XBand Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãPro is positioned as a tracker for professional runners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/354/166/acd/354166acd5a7c1fb6db39a35699c8a74.jpg"><br><br>  The device allows you to analyze and improve your results without putting a lot of money for the services of a personal trainer.  The gadget provides accurate data about the time of the race from the moment of the start to the crossing of the finish line, the maximum speed of the athlete, as well as his reaction to the starting signal and the time required to reach the maximum speed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b0a/d72/c25/b0ad72c253c8bd79b7158e226b4e3325.jpg"><br><br>  Information about each training session is recorded using several modules.  The bandage with the sensor unit is mounted on the arm, a special registration module is installed on the finishing line to fix the exact time, and the adapter for the smartphone interprets the results in a special application.  You can access training history via the Internet. <br><br>  With the help of Kickstarter, manufacturers are planning to raise $ 150,000. So far, about $ 4 thousand has been received, there are 23 days left until the end of the fundraising campaign.  Deliveries of the gadget are planned in October 2014. <br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1641367336/xband-speed-pro-wearable-technology-for-real-athle">Link to the project on Kickstarter.</a> <br><br><h4>  PROMiXX - Sports drink blending bottle </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8b9/9ef/69f/8b99ef69febdf0ac07629c71f7ad349d.jpg"><br><br>  True sports fans will undoubtedly be interested in the sports bottle PROMiXX, in which you can prepare healthy drinks based on food additives at the touch of a button.  Now you can make your favorite drink or cocktail anywhere, even if there is no mixer or blender nearby.  The technology used by Vortex Mixing Technology makes it possible to obtain absolutely homogeneous mixtures, simultaneously enriching water with oxygen and improving its bioavailability.  PROMiXX can be used to prepare a wide variety of beverages - from sports blends containing proteins and dietary supplements, to milkshakes, baby food mixes, and even alcohol-based cocktails.  The bottle has an optimal capacity of 600 ml and is made of impact-resistant plastic that does not absorb odors.  The electric motor that provides mixing can be easily removed for quick and easy cleaning of plastic containers.  The inventors of the device also provided a self-cleaning function - just add a drop of detergent to the bottle and press a button.  The intellectual "shaker" collected almost $ 60 thousand on the Kickstarter crowdfunding site, with a plan of $ 30 thousand, deliveries are planned this spring. <br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/promixx/promixx-the-original-vortex-mixer">Link to the project on Kickstarter.</a> <br><br>  If you want to be the first to learn about the latest medical and fitness gadgets, follow the company news, subscribe to our pages on social networks.
