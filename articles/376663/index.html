  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sony SmartEyeglass and other smart glasses</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9e3/a4d/753/9e3a4d7530f64188821b2c54cc1ebba2.gif"><br><br>  So far, Google, judging by numerous facts and confirmations, undertook to rethink the strategy of Google Glasses, in the Sony laboratory, it seems, they decided to force the project of augmented reality glasses.  How else to explain the presentation of the prototype of the custom version of SmartEyeglass Attach glasses!  in January at SEC2015, and the opening of the pre-order for the developer version of SmartEyeglass Developer Edition SED-E1, which can already be purchased in the US for $ 840. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And from March 10, application developers will be able to get acquainted with the potential of the updated version of the software development kit (SDK).  So some kind of feedback in the near future can be expected.  After all, there are a lot of questions, even in terms of the utility of this glasses model. <br><br>  Firstly, the working kit consists of three gadgets at once - directly the glasses, the wired remote and also your Android smartphone.  With that, Sony‚Äôs SmartEyeglass capabilities are largely replicated by Google‚Äôs.  Although the price, of course, is not the last.

      <br>
      Secondly, to grace and titanium in Google Glass oh, how far these points, not to mention the overall design - angular, with only one type of greenish lenses. <br><br>  In the meantime, in the ‚Äúshock asset‚Äù of the model: a gyroscope and an accelerometer, an electronic compass, a microphone and a light sensor, a camera with a resolution of 3 megapixels.  They weigh almost twice as much as Google‚Äôs - 77 grams, and the work time is about two hours. <br><br>  In general, we are waiting for the activity of the developers: they will take up the applications - this will be the first step to success.  No - well, let's forget about them. <br><br><h4>  Ora smart glass </h4><br>  California-based developer Optinvent, who successfully completed last year‚Äôs funding for Kickstarter of the project with its version of augmented reality glasses - <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/optinvent-ora1/ora-1-smart-glasses-developer-version">ORA Smart Glass</a> , is not far behind Sony.  The prototype is also presented for developers so far, but in the middle of the coming year, the manufacturer already promises to release a custom model. <br><br>  According to the stated specifications, the glasses are superior to Google Glass in everything, including the patented projection technology.  More information about the model can be found <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/optinvent-ora1/ora-1-smart-glasses-developer-version">here</a> .  True, it is written, though beautifully, but when you look at the glasses themselves, one question arises: ‚ÄúCouldn't you have thought more terrible?‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/495/18b/21d/49518b21d0054405bab3842229e6a8cd.png"><br><br>  The only thing that really pleases so far is the price of $ 399. <br><br><h4>  Glassup </h4><br>  The problem of interference with privacy with integrated cameras in smart glasses stands in the way of the development of all gadgets of this kind.  No wonder that visiting many public places - from bars and restaurants to lectures at universities and exhibitions in them is prohibited. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c3/f07/40c/4c3f0740c5dc4b858fa9c3a2e91af435.png"><br><br>  Therefore, the developers of GlassUp have changed the very concept of SmartGlasses, removing the camera and leaving only the projection system of all the events in your smartphone.  That is almost the same headphones, working on Bluetooth, only supplemented by visualization.  Messages, work with all kinds of applications - and they have already been given a lot by developers, social networks and so on - in fact, all the functionality of a smartphone is in front of your eyes.  And for only $ <a href="http://www.glassup.net/features.html">299</a> . <br><br><h4>  Meta 1 </h4><br>  <a href="https://www.getameta.com/">META</a> engineers believe that in the very near future, smart glasses will crowd out not only smartphones, but also personal computers.  And the main argument in their favor is called the breakthrough technology of three-dimensional information visualization: two embedded LCD-displays with a resolution of 1280x720 create a realistic hologram - almost like in the laboratory of Tony Stark in ‚ÄúIron Man‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/912/2bf/db9/9122bfdb9f6845a3abf2d61f2ca44044.png"><br><br>  In February, the set consisting of the glasses and the operating unit will go to the developers, and in June, Meta hopes to announce the release of a serial user sample.  Well, wait and see, what will fill the reality for $ 667. <br><br><h4>  Recon jet </h4><br>  The world's first "smart" points, focused on athletes.  Combining all the current capabilities of augmented reality with the functionality that is necessary for people leading an active lifestyle, Recon Instruments introduced its model <a href="http://www.reconinstruments.com/products/jet/">Recon Jet Smart Glasses</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/723/de6/e05/723de6e053d6410dbc3c0a7e15e5b0e7.png"><br><br>  Navigation, training and activity parameters, social networks and applications - much of this model has a lot, a word for the developers.  And although the official release of the mass series is scheduled only for September of this year, you can place a pre-order now - the announced price is $ 599. <br><br><h4>  Oakley Airwave 1.5 Snow </h4><br>  Specialized "smart" glasses for fans of freeride and dizzying stunts on the mountain slopes last year released one of the leaders of sports optics - the American giant Oakley.  The model resembles standard sports models for snowboarders and skiers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c42/bf5/419/c42bf5419bf24f2695a005b105457962.png"><br><br>  From the hardware, these glasses are supplemented by a camera, a patented prism projector, which reproduces a picture similar to that of a 14-inch monitor viewed from a two-meter distance.  Naturally, there are built-in gyros, accelerometers, GPS-module and navigation system on the slope. <br><br>  It should be noted that the software part and most of the applications that are directly related to the tricks and descents are written in Recon Instruments, and everything is downloaded from them.  And you can buy Oakley Airwave 1.5 Snow today for <a href="http://www.oakley.com/en/mens/goggles/snow-goggles/airwave/product/W0OO7049%3Fvariant%3D700285844398%26fit%3DGLOBAL%26lensShape%3DSTANDARD">$ 649</a> . <br><br><h4>  Technical Illusions CastAR </h4><br>  Starting with a small startup on Kickstarter, which, however, ended up with a million and a half dollars collected, the former Valve engineers, Jerry Ellsworth and Rick Johnson, today represent the fourth generation of augmented reality 3D glasses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bab/ad0/6c4/babad06c4ecb47ca91ca69deff67df91.png"><br><br>  But they complement this very reality, for the most part, with the holographic characters of games and three-dimensional projections of cities, buildings and objects, mixing illusions and the real world.  In general, as you understand, the CastAR glasses from Technical Illusions are intended for entertainment.  You can read more about them <a href="http://technicalillusions.com/">here</a> , and pre-order is accepted <a href="https://technical-illusions.myshopify.com/">here</a> , the declared price is $ 345. <br><br> <a href="http://litemf.com/ru/price"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73c/16f/590/73c16f59056a41469dce57f8d06f3150.jpg"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376663/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376663/</a></p>
