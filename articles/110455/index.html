Skeptics are confounded again. <br><br>  Already as a month the project is getting up on its feet, growing stronger, overgrown with new convenient features and making friends.

      But first things first‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The scheme of the project is very simple: <br><ol><li>  The author has an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa socially useful project. </li><li>  He proposes an idea to the people and says how much money he needs for it and by what time. </li><li>  Financing of the project continues until the end of the stated period. </li><li>  Or the project collects the entire amount claimed, or does not receive anything. </li></ol><br><br>  Now a little more. <br><br>  What kind of ideas can be financed from the C-world?  The answer is obvious, if at all distance from the Internet, a specific site and look into the essence of the phenomenon.  This may be a music album, an exhibition of paintings, a new device, a book, a performance, etc.  Anything, the result of which can be useful to those who invest.  Hence the requirements: creativity and sociality. <br><br>  The second point is important because  creates a non-chisel entry criterion, eliminating 99% trash.  Here the author‚Äôs rationality, the level of trust in him, and other social factors that affect whether funds flow into the project or not, work.  For example, if a well-known indie artist asks to collect $ 25,000 per month.  to complete studio work on a new album, then why not help it?  A famous person, we all love music ... what else do you need? <br>  The third point is direct financing.  For assistance to the project, the author promises rewards to those who support him.  For example, transferred to the project from 100 rubles.  he promises to print the name on the album booklet and on the website, from 300 - an autograph disk, or a signed souvenir (if a person prefers mp3), from 500 - free admission to the concert.  Thus, the creation of a common cause turns out to be interesting for both parties.  Everyone gets pleasure from the process, satisfaction from the work done and pleasant additions.  The author of the project chooses the thresholds and rewards.  And here he should show ingenuity and ingenuity - the success of his entire enterprise may depend on the right choice. <br><br>  The fourth point is at the same time a guarantee, and let's say, a peppercorn idea.  If the project has not collected the amount that was collected, then the funds are returned to those who invested them, or they can be transferred to another project of interest.  The project does not receive any money and is frozen on the site.  If the amount is collected, then it is transferred to the author of the project and he begins work.  Now he is responsible for implementing the project as he described, and to ensure that he has invested money for what he promised for it.  By the way, the project can recruit more than what was intended, and it did.  So do not think, there are still people who do not spare money for a good cause. <br><br>  Thus, the scheme is closed.  Everyone benefits, the scheme has already proved that it can attract interesting ideas and help them to be accomplished.  Now it‚Äôs up to support, popularization and development of this topic in Russia. <br>  The main questions that worried people found the answers: <br><br>  Question: Why should I invest in some project?  What will I get from this? <br>  Answer: Firstly, this is moral satisfaction from the fact that you are helping someone, a sense of belonging to a good cause.  You can talk as much as you want around this topic, but all questions disappear when a person sees that something has been done on his money.  He becomes like an important bird, walks and says to everyone: ‚ÄúIt was me who helped him to record an album,‚Äù or ‚Äúwithout me there would be nothing of that‚Äù.  It looks funny, but it's true happiness :) When we completed the first project with successful funding, the adults simply clapped their hands and smiled to the ears from the realization that this was all possible. <br><br>  Question: Why not raise money and not dump?  We are constantly cheated in this way, what guarantees? <br>  Answer: Help those you love and trust.  Be curious, study projects, meet people, ask questions and ask for answers.  Maybe sometime you will come here with your project. <br><br>  So, what's new for the month and what are the nearest plans: <br><ul><li>  We finished the design of all legal issues and now we are absolutely legal. </li><li>  Docked with Robokassa and now we are able to accept payments in all possible ways. </li><li>  Significantly improved the appearance (although it is still far to a good level, but do not worry - everything will be. New Year holidays ahead;) </li><li>  Made it possible to share information about projects in social networks, bookmark aggregators, etc. </li><li>  We financed one project and are already helping five others. </li><li>  Made a form for feedback and suggestions. </li></ul><br><br>  We plan in the near future: <br><ul><li>  Make a multilogin, work on which is already underway.  And then you can come to us from many popular networks and comment on projects, to take part in them.  And also run your own and receive support from other users, no matter where they came from. </li><li>  Widget for posting on other sites information about projects. </li><li>  Redesign the interface to make the site more convenient and understandable. </li></ul><br><br>  As already noted, for the month we found several good projects.  There is a website for a music band, there is a SteadyCam for photographers.  The projects are different, the projects are interesting, and this is very good.  People understood how all this should earn and joined the topic.  I was very pleasantly surprised that many of them wrote and called us, telling me how they were pleased when the first payments came to their projects. <br><br>  As we expected, the distrust had to be kindled, and today the project participants have begun to help each other; the number of projects is gradually replenishing.  After the first wave of interest, when we received up to 700 visitors a day, the excitement subsided a bit, but we hope that this is a temporary phenomenon and we expect a surge! <br><br>  On the approach there are already different projects, which, if they relate to the subject of Habr, we will tell you.  Already we can say that some of them will be very interesting for the local audience.  I will not get ahead with the details, but I will say that among them is printing a small edition of books, shooting a video clip and financing city projects in one small, but highly developed, settlement. <br><br>  This is the progress for the month.  Given that the work is done by one and a half people, it is quite good, as it seems.  Ahead of the New Year is the time of miracles!  I hope, and we can sell you something on these holidays.  We will work hard for this.  And we are waiting for you on the <a href="http://s-miru-po-nitke.ru/">C-world-by-thread</a> ! <br><br>  And a small announcement: <br><br>  It so happened that our team distributed across Mother Russia with the whole team after the New Year will meet in Novosibirsk.  We decided not to miss this opportunity and <a href="http://nayk.sphere-software.org/index.php/2010/12/20/s-miru-po-nitke-v-nii-kuda/">organized a friendly meeting</a> at the club of the Novosibirsk Academgorodok Research Institute of Culture and Technology.  The meeting will be held on the 4th of January and will begin at 16:00.  The event is open to all comers, so come on, it will be interesting - we will tell and show everything. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110455/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110455/</a></p>
