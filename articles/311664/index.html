      CIOs are becoming more influential, and their priorities are also changing.  Traditional priorities, such as improving operational efficiency and ensuring stable IT productivity, have decreased by 16% and 27%, respectively. <br>  Roles and priorities are changing. <br><br>  Lisa Henegan, head of the KPMG global network advisory service, told Computer Weekly that while traditional IT priorities are important, but new technologies and problems have changed them. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis sets new requirements for CIOs.  We are witnessing the evolution of ‚Äúcreative IT directors,‚Äù who are both techies and business strategists, as well as authors of innovative business models, ‚Äùshe said. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe role of the CIO is a transition from control to cooperation, when more and more time is spent not on control, but on other functions,‚Äù she said. <br><br>  The study found that 4 out of 10 CIOs now spend at least one day a week working on tasks that are not their own, and 55% believe that their career will move beyond IT in the next five years. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe scope of attention is now much wider.  CIOs spend more time with their business colleagues and customers, and we need to understand which technologies need to be brought into the organization, in particular, those that provide growth opportunities. ‚Äù <br><br>  Harvey Nash CEO Albert Ellis said that CIOs deal with a greater variety of problems than ever, "many of which are very far from traditional IT." <br><br>  ‚ÄúAdaptability, which affects skills and the ability to keep a clear head in turbulent times, are becoming increasingly important skills for a modern IT director,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  However, they still have to play the role of traditional CIOs.  ‚ÄúWhatever happens, the equipment should work reliably and safely, this task will not go anywhere,‚Äù Heneghan added. <br><br><h3>  Lack of skills </h3><br>  CIOs also face challenges, and especially skills.  About 65% of the IT directors interviewed said they believe that a lack of ability would prevent organizations from keeping up with the times. <br>  Analytical data, digital skills and safety skills are most in demand, and Heneghan said that all industries suffer from a shortage of qualified personnel, and that this is the highest figure since the Great Recession. <br><br>  Retaining talent is also a problem.  While 44% of CIOs plan to grow their teams in 2016, 89% have ‚Äúsome‚Äù or ‚Äúbig‚Äù concerns about retaining talented employees. <br><br><h3>  Lack of cybersecurity skills </h3><br>  One of the areas where skills are lacking is safety.  Only about 22% of respondents said that they are confident that their organization is able to identify and respond to cyber attacks. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAlmost all organizations we deal with work a lot in this direction,‚Äù Heneghan said.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs disturbing that less than a quarter of IT executives feel they are well-versed in cyber attacks / IT security,‚Äù said Adam Woodhouse, advisor to the IT director at KMPG UK, in a report. <br><br>  ‚ÄúOnly 40% of respondents noted that internal problems are causing considerable concern, but the proportion of cyber-incidents that occur inside the organization is growing.  Several CIOs underestimate this risk and overestimate the threat of organized cyber crime? ‚Äù <br><br>  The survey also showed that the number of women in the leadership role has increased by a third over the past year.  However, this figure is still only 9% in the UK, and 11% worldwide.  Norway topped the table, there women occupy 26% of the leading positions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311664/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311664/</a></p>
