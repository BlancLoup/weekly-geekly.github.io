      It should be noted that the platform of ITU events (ITU) is becoming an aggregation of the desires of individual governments to increase control over the Internet environment through some nationalization and balkanization of the Network along state borders. <br>  It is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159831/">not the first year that the</a> international non-profit organization <a href="https://www.icann.org/ru">ICANN</a> has <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/159831/">wanted to select a</a> number of functions and transfer this to the ITU.  And if we talk about affairs within Russia, then transfer the functions of the Coordination Center of the national domain of the Internet ( <a href="http://cctld.ru/ru/">CC</a> ) to the subordinate structures of the Ministry of Communications and Mass Media. <br><br>  In a word, active steps are being taken to nationalize the Internet and remove it from the hands of public organizations. <br><br>  All this is happening under the auspices of protecting the rights and freedoms of citizens of our country, which causes great doubts - it is only necessary to analyze the <a href="http://rublacklist.net/8765/">trend of domestic lawmaking</a> in the state regulation of network space. <br>  Since 2012, many laws have been passed to regulate the Internet (and <a href="http://rublacklist.net/8518/">many</a> more <a href="http://rublacklist.net/8518/">are being trained</a> and read in the State Duma), but most of them bear only new restrictions, prohibitions, leveling citizens' rights on the Internet and burdens for the IT business. <br><br>  Speaking at the conference, Nikoforov essentially proposed to segment the Global Network along state borders. <br>  As an argument, he cited information that allegedly high risks of shutting down the Internet from the outside, although in fact such cases did not yet occur, there were cases on the contrary when the Internet was disconnected from within the country itself for its own citizens.  The example given about Syria, which occurred in 2012, is rather a ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/233331/">funny case</a> ‚Äù after a hacker attack to establish a backdoor, and not a deliberate Internet shutdown by another state. <br><br>  Actually the direct speech of our sectoral Minister at the international level: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúDear Mr. Chairman!  Your Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen! <br>  The 2014 Plenipotentiary Conference is held on the eve of the 150th anniversary of the International Telecommunication Union.  The main task of the ITU was and is to connect people around the world.  With the help of ITU and based on the norms of international law and standards developed within the framework of the Union, we all managed to achieve much-needed results in the development and use of telecommunications. <br>  The world is changing, and the union must adapt to new challenges that arise in connection with the evolution of telecommunications and its convergence with information technology. <br>  Mobilization of the international community is required to prevent the use of ICT for purposes contrary to the UN Charter, Constitution, Convention and ITU regulations.  For successful, reliable and safe use of ICT, international norms and rules governing relations in this area are needed. <br>  The Russian Federation believes that such norms should be developed under the auspices of UN institutions.  They should proceed from the adherence to the principles of non-interference in the internal affairs of states, their equality in the management of Internet infrastructure, the sovereign right of states to manage infrastructure in the national segment of the network and be based on international law and respect for basic human rights and freedoms. <br>  Today, the Internet penetrates all spheres of personal and professional life of people, opening up not only new opportunities, but also making the world more and more vulnerable.  And this is not only about interfering in the private lives of people, destabilizing the political situation in entire regions.  There are great risks of deliberately disrupting the work of national segments of the network or completely disconnecting countries from the Internet without explanation and without reference to the norms of international law.  And these threats are relevant to all ITU member states.  Recall the information that Edward Snowden voiced about the targeted disconnection of Syria from the Internet in 2012.  At the UN site, we have to offer such an evolution of relations on the Internet, so that states regain their sovereignty on the network, and their citizens the jurisdiction of their countries! <br>  We perfectly understand that without business, without competition, new technologies will not develop.  But personal data must be protected.  And it is the states that act as guarantor of the rights of citizens and the protection of their personal data.  When the opening ceremony of the conference began, we all turned off access to the Internet and all the phones in the hall.  Who did this?  Did this business?  No, it did not business.  Or maybe it was a decision involving all interested parties?  No, it did the state in whose territory we are.  And did it for safety.  Someone in the hall stood up and protested?  Not.  Obviously, it is pointless to deny the role of states in the management of ICT infrastructure. <br>  But let's move from the form to the point.  For example, in Russia in February 2014, President Vladimir Putin signed amendments to the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Communications‚Äù, where we guarantee the availability of a fiber-optic communication line in almost every locality in our country, where more than 250 people live.  We need to build more than 200 thousand kilometers.  This is one of the largest construction projects in the world.  And 97% of Russian citizens will get Internet access. <br>  All distinguished heads of delegations of communications administrations in this room are implementing their national plans for the development of broadband Internet access.  And we need to be sure that the networks we create will be safe and stable. <br>  On the basis of how the Internet works, we see potential vulnerabilities in the operation of the domain name system, the threat and corruption of information in the registry database, which makes it impossible to verify routing address information, is relevant. <br>  These are threats of network unity. <br>  It is obvious that the process of changing the management of the Internet infrastructure should be consistent, transparent, focused on the needs of the people.  We consider it possible to discuss the need for the development and adoption of an international convention on the management of Internet infrastructure. <br>  The International Telecommunication Union in the preparation and holding of the High-Level Event of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS + 10) this year reaffirmed its ability to find mutually acceptable solutions to the most complex issues involving all interested parties. <br>  It is advisable to send the achieved results to the high-level event on WSIS in December 2015 and approve it at the level of the UN General Assembly.  It is also necessary to analyze the implementation of the Tunis phase of the summit, including the management of Internet infrastructure. <br>  Traditionally, we have put forward our candidacy to the ITU Council, as well as the candidature of Viktor Strelets to the Radio Regulations Board.  We ask to support our candidacies. ‚Äù <br><br>  The issue of protecting the Runet from possible provocations from the outside was discussed at the beginning of October 2014 at a meeting of the Russian Security Council.  Presidential Aide Igor Schegolev reported to President Vladimir Putin on the results of the summer exercises, the purpose of which was to find out how stable the Russian segment of the Internet is to external influences.  It turned out that the runet is rather unstable.  And in a recent interview, Schegolev explained why this is so: "The key elements of the Internet are outside of Russia and are not controlled by us."  Names and addresses are assigned according to the rules of the ICANN organization, and ‚Äúit is not only a legal entity established under US law, but also controlled by the Department of Commerce of this country‚Äù.  As a result, access to any site can be blocked at any stage.  ‚ÄúUltimately, the RuNet can be blocked entirely,‚Äù concluded Schegolev and called for the creation of a ‚Äúkey Internet infrastructure‚Äù in Russia, including national root servers and a national route-address information system. <br><br>  The representative of ICANN did not comment on the statements of Nikiforov and Schegolev. <br><br>  Unfortunately, it is Russia that is becoming one of the centers of destruction of the Global Network and setting in it artificial borders and restrictions. <br>  The elephant has already not only entered the canteen, but also began its restructuring according to his own understanding. <br><br>  Will the Network and those organizations that stand on its protection (integrity, stability, freedom and the exclusion of unnecessary bindings) defend their right to a full existence, or will everything turn into local Cheburashka? <br><br>  Google's video featuring Wint Surf on what constitutes ICANN, how this organization works and the domain / server infrastructure it controls, and why all this is needed (from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/230959/">this post</a> ): <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vd3dH90tdhk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjo8QB0JnqTkEQxb8dvp8l_zBS0ng" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Based on: <br>  <a href="http://www.itu.int/">itu.int</a> <br>  <a href="http://minsvyaz.ru/ru/news/index.php%3Fid_4%3D44922">minsvyaz.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://rublacklist.net/">rublacklist.net</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/34996261/rossii-nuzhen-svoj-internet%3Ffull">vedomosti.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362095/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362095/</a></p>
