What is this market?  What can modern robot-toys do?  What is the average cost of a robot and which robots are suitable as a gift?  I will tell you about all this a little now. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>A bit of theory and numbers</b> <br>  Currently, robots have entered human life in different areas, but there is still no clear separation among robotic devices, as well as a single software platform.  Different manufacturers make different and totally incompatible hardware.  Technologies and tools are sharpened every time for specific problems, it is almost impossible to reuse them.  The main stumbling block when creating robots is artificial intelligence. <br><br>  Many decision-making devices, based on data received from sensors, can also theoretically be considered robots.  But in this case, such devices can include elevators that we use every day, and anti-lock braking systems that help avoid accidents.

      Nowadays, the leader in the density of robots per capita is Japan, where there are 295 robots per 10,000 enterprise workers, the United States and Europe are far behind, the gap with other countries is even more significant.  In Europe, there are 50 robots per 10,000 workers, the majority of which are engaged in heavy industrial production, pharmaceuticals and the automotive industry. <br><br>  Compared with the rest of the world, Russia as a whole is scientifically in no way inferior, including robotics.  However, technical implementations are far behind after the collapse of the USSR. <br>  Robots focused on the leisure and entertainment industry, as well as helper robots (vacuum cleaners, lawn mowers, pool washers), are in the greatest demand in Russia. <br><br>  <b>Android robots (toys and semi-professional)</b> <br>  The most simple android robots are mainly represented by the goods of the American company <a href="http://wowwee.com/">WowWee</a> .  The most famous series of Robosapien is a humanoid robot that can be controlled, both from the console and programmed a sequence of movements.  What can such robots?  First, how strange it sounds, they can walk!  As I already mentioned, mechatronics is a complex science, and to teach a robot to walk properly is not an easy task.  Therefore, in low-priced products like Robosapien, naturally this is implemented relatively simply.  Robots of this series can also move hands and head, and the built-in camera allows them not only to orient themselves in space, but also, for example, to memorize some objects (the Robosapien V2 remembers the color of the ball using a color sensor).  The most interesting feature of Robosapien is its programming.  You can easily program it to perform any movements, and this is done manually: you set one position yourself with your hands, then the next, and so on.  The average cost of Sowen robots from WowWee is about 7-10,000 rubles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9b/c96/d0a/a9bc96d0a845e6cba2b33a655c74b5b9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A more serious model is, for example, i-Sobot from <a href="http://www.isobotrobot.com/eng/">Tomy</a> .  First, it is the smallest in the world, according to the Guinness Book, a humanoid robot that is mass-produced (height 17 cm).  Developed in 2007, it is still quite advanced in its class.  The robot already has several modes: ordinary remote, voice, programming and special effects.  Can perform up to 157 commands.  17 servos (and the same degrees of freedom) plus a gyro sensor - a good filling for a robot, costing less than 10,000 rubles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3c7/820/5d5/3c78205d5edb10eaa3d414d8060a34dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, from the series ‚Äúvery cool, but available for order‚Äù I want to present the NAO robot from the French company Aldebaran Robotics.  Nao can pick up small objects and even process audio and visual information to navigate the world around.  The creators of the robot say that they managed to create "the first robot capable of creating and developing emotions, as well as adopting the emotional state of man."  Due to the fact that the machine has the functions of recognizing and memorizing people, Nao remembers with whom and how he communicated.  ‚ÄúIn essence, the robot behaves exactly like a child.  He also has an intelligence system that allows him to get a little experience in communicating with people. ‚Äù  The robot can be ordered in some Russian online stores, and its cost will amount to about 700-750 thousand rubles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/582/e86/802/582e86802d1a8dcfb3b9f07f3a956f95.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, they can even be controlled using Kinect, as in the video: <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tygf23A6ezw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgHbvSgGNMeplCLoQ2_8GK2KfBC1A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>Toy robots (animals, insects, etc.)</b> <br>  In this category I will take the goods of the company WowWee, HexBug, Pleo, WALL-E and others. <br><br>  The most primitive, the so-called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BEAM_robotics">BEAM-robots</a> , the logic of which is fully implemented using fairly simple circuits.  Very often, the BEAM-robot only knows how to drive a light or sound, and make some sounds (or blink an LED) - if it's time to recharge the battery.  This level of robots presented the company <a href="http://www.hexbug.com/">HEXBUG</a> , wrapped in a beautiful case.  It should be noted that the product has been very successful.  All ingenious is simple!  HEXBUG are bugs, which in fact can only run.  There is one great ‚Äútrick‚Äù of such a product.  With the help of additional accessories, you can build nanodromes and organize competitions between robots.  Very entertaining and fun.  Such insect robots cost about 500-700 rubles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0c2/6c4/028/0c26c402806a9b69db49cf03f9fe32a4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  About the company WowWee, I have already mentioned.  Among the range of toys series Roboraptor, Roboquad, Alive and others.  In general, all the toys are fairly standard and in functionality correspond to the Robosapien series.  Therefore, I will not dwell in detail.  The cost of toys varies from 1000 to 8000 rubles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea3/04a/32f/ea304a32f830ec7f917661dfb195abc9.jpg" alt="image"><br>  One of the best and most well-known animal robots was Sony AIBO at one time.  Sony stopped the release of this remarkable product in 2005 mainly due to competition from WowWee, and not because AIBO is less functional, but because the cost of such a dog was almost $ 2000, which is 10 times more than the cost of WowWee solutions. .  The artificial intelligence program (AI), which forms the basis of the robot, is used in Sony consumer electronics.  Thus, the ‚Äúsoul‚Äù of the robot dog received a second life. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d54/2e9/452/d542e945286f4534c9aef7d468fd17c8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And in conclusion of this section I will note the fun and quite ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù <a href="http://www.pleoworld.com/Home.aspx">Pleo</a> dinosaur robot.  Pleo imitates the appearance and behavior of a baby dinosaur of the species Camarasaurus, who is only a week old. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e6c/06e/6eb/e6c06e6ebcf6e71c52bc15fce1ba1183.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The creators chose this type of dinosaur because their body has an elongated shape and a relatively large skull - this makes it ideal for hiding a large number of sensors and engines necessary for realistic dinosaur movements. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e3c/33f/5be/e3c33f5bef67ba10428a422c263b97aa.jpg" alt="image"><br>  38 sensors, the ability of autonomous interaction with the host through a set of commands, various moods turn a dinosaur into an unpretentious pet.  Pleo feels hunger and fatigue, has a craving for learning everything new and is constantly evolving.  He will fall asleep or stroll slowly around the room when he himself considers it necessary.  The cost of such a wonderful toy robot is 11-14,000 rubles, depending on the store. <br><br>  <b>If you decide to buy</b> <br>  In RuNet, there are now about 25 shops selling robots, and usually either this is a robot toy store or vacuum cleaner robots.  The latter have become quite popular especially among the residents of the capital, who do not have enough time for cleaning and are ready for 20,000 rubles (the average price of a vacuum cleaner robot) to get rid of this headache.  The most useful shops in RuNet: <br><br>  <a href="http://roboticslab.ru/">RoboticsLab</a> - a fairly wide range of thematic store will allow you to pick up various robots, ranging from toys, to designers and components. <br>  <a href="http://robotronic.ru/">RoboTronic</a> is one of the oldest stores, in which, in addition to robots, other gadgets are represented. <br>  <a href="http://nanojam.ru/">NanoJam</a> - here you can buy not only toys, but also research models and platforms. <br>  <a href="http://www.lefutur.ru/">LeFutur</a> is a famous store, part of the range of which is also represented by WowWee toys and funny little retro robots. <br><br>  At present, the commercial market for domestic robots is growing at an average of 15% per year and, according to experts, a big boom awaits us soon, as it happened with computer technologies and products. <br><br>  <b>Instead of conclusion</b> <br>  I would like to tell a lot more interesting things from the world of robotics and highlight more serious products, but perhaps we will leave it for the next review article.  In it, I will touch on the topic of teleprezens-robots ( <a href="http://www.anybots.com/">AnyBots QB</a> , Russian <a href="http://rbot100.rbot.ru/">R.Bot 100</a> , <a href="http://www.gostai.com/">Gostai Jazz</a> and others), <a href="http://www.anybots.com/">helpers</a> robots (vacuum cleaners, lawn mowers, for cleaning floors) and intellectual designers Fischertechnik and Lego. <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117302/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117302/</a></p>
