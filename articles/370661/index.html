Not only because it is called the ‚Äúreinforcement legend‚Äù at every step (although everyone has flaws), but also during its long history.  We will tell you more about everything right now, but today we are gathered primarily to see the second coming of the legend in the face of the <a href="http://etymoticrus.ru/cat/%3Fmodel%3Der4">ER4SR and ER4XR models</a> - modifications of ER4. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hfhe/blog/291307/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3dd/c80/88b/3ddc8088b37368827efca0a1850eeffd.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The leader and innovator in the field of sound prostheses, Etymotic in the early 90s released its line of in-ear headphones Etymotic Research ER4.  Later, the company began to expand the model range, releasing ER4RB and a special version for traveling (ER4PT), but it became widely known thanks to two models: ER4P and ER4S.  The latter are recognized even by picky experts as the best in-channel reinforcement headphones in history with almost linear frequency response and incredible accuracy.  One reinforcing emitter and a decent sound source (this is important) can literally give the standard of music reproduction.  Those who have ever listened to these headphones will not let them lie. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d88/a2a/707/d88a2a707db7eadf60278b4a9ad833d8.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Etymotic ER4S with third-party cable</font></i>

      At one time, audiophiles went crazy about ER4S - they shared their impressions of the ‚Äúpeak at 3 kHz‚Äù, tuned resistance with the help of original accessories.  It got to the point that they were interested in each other. ‚ÄúDo you have a direct auditory canal?  After all, these headphones should be drowned as deeply as possible. ‚Äù  Fever, not otherwise.  But there were reasons for her.  Did Etymotic reincarnation succeed, and was it worth it for the manufacturer to raise a hand to the holy in general?  Let's try to answer this question. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2e/a04/732/a2ea04732b1948ec24487ad4678bff47.png"><br><br>  In appearance, ER4XR (Extended Response) and ER4SR (Studio Reference) headphones are no different, except that the inscriptions on the boxes are different.  Moreover, the main characteristics of them are also the same - the resistance is 45 Ohms and the sensitivity is 98 dB.  For comparison, the old ER4P and ER4S had a resistance of 27 ohms and 100 ohms, and the sensitivity was 102 dB and 90 dB, respectively.  In other words, the manufacturer chose average values: compatibility improved with reduced resistance, and ER4S didn‚Äôt really have enough sensitivity. <br><br>  At the same time for the new models have made a new emitter, but according to the sound characteristics, as the manufacturer claims, the headphones are still different.  If the ER4SR has a more even sound, then the ER4XR is clearly more ‚Äúleaning‚Äù towards the bass, there is a slight boost at low frequencies. <br><br><h2>  Etymotic ER4SR and ER4XR features </h2><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  Driver type <br></td><td>  Reinforcement one <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Headphone Type <br></td><td>  Closed <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Frequency range <br></td><td>  20 - 16000 Hz <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Impedance <br></td><td>  45 ohm <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Sensitivity <br></td><td>  98 dB <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Headphone Sound Pressure (SPL) <br></td><td>  122 dB <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Cable <br></td><td>  Straight Y-shaped <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Ear cushions <br></td><td>  Silicone <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><h2>  Etymotic ER4SR and ER4XR </h2><br>  The habitual but spectacular box hides another one under it, and only in a black hard fabric case do the headphones themselves hide under this whole structure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/35d/42b/422/35d42b42268023b390ed7d1ec35fda61.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/767/1da/5b2/7671da5b2a068b6eef2a5c10b7915f14.jpg"><br><br>  The delivery set is not just ‚Äúrich‚Äù - everything is there that is needed: several pairs of three-petal silicone nozzles of various sizes, a set of foam nozzles (it would be strange not to see it here), two pairs of interchangeable acoustic filters with a tool to replace them, an adapter with 3.5 mm by 6.3 mm, if you want to be completely "bad", as well as a small clip for attaching the cable to clothes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ccf/15a/a4e/ccf15aa4ecf54e40343d0cd7ea032870.jpg"><br><br>  Carrying case deserves special attention - in few places you will see such attention to detail.  It is divided into several compartments, small pockets with zippers.  In general, not only the headphones themselves, but also a small player in addition, for example, our Astell &amp; Kern AK 70, with which the testing was carried out, went perfectly in size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/88c/7b6/40a/88c7b640a244544dac48c6b647646dd4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ccf/15a/a4e/ccf15aa4ecf54e40343d0cd7ea032870.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef4/7be/ddc/ef47beddcbc0e0f72473ee7c1c58d31f.jpg"><br><br>  For headphones of this level the equipment is more than enough, let's take a closer look at them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/91b/8fa/09f/91b8fa09f2306cb51bf46b263a83eb01.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Appearance and innovations </h2><br>  First of all, it is worth noting the use, as it is now fashionable, of anodized aluminum, thanks to which both models look much more spectacular (and in many respects also because of the inscriptions using laser engraving), the manufacturer used black plastic earlier.  At the same time, the headphones almost did not change from the ER4S, Etymotic obviously wanted to keep the concept of their headphones, which was once warmly received by audiophiles around the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e2/d2d/26c/8e2d2d26cbf4c9e27e0017a3b721c21e.jpg"><br><br>  Significant changes have affected the cable, which has become more subtle, soft and elastic and less susceptible to the microphone effect.  Although it remained replaceable, but now it has not its own branded connectors, but standard widely used mmcx.  This solution will obviously please the owners of steep, high-quality cables, and the rest will easily be able to replace the wire in a couple of movements if such a desire arises.  In addition, the cable sits in the socket is much more reliable, due to the presence of the holder, which prevents the rotation of the plug.  It may seem to someone that is too long, but if you use the clip from the kit, the friction of the wire on the clothes does not affect the sensations from listening. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2fe/5da/f45/2fe5daf4575b75257422ecc3c0fd5510.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dda/8d5/6be/dda8d56be24ab3c8faf7468eaa020ed6.jpg"><br><br>  Owners of the previous model will surely remember how the protrusion around the cable plug did not allow to connect headphones to some models of players and mobile phones.  In the new versions, the manufacturer listened to its users: the cable is truly universal, there is a ‚Äúslider‚Äù for fixing the headphones in place, and the clip began to look more solid. <br><br>  Headphones are designed for deep planting in the ears (it seems that the joke about the ‚Äúdirect auditory canal‚Äù does not seem so funny anymore), as evidenced by triple nozzles in the form of ‚ÄúChristmas trees‚Äù.  If you are not used to it, it can be difficult to insert them; you need to rotate the radiator body very carefully in order not to experience discomfort.  Etymotic claims that they have eliminated the shortcomings of this design, so now you can listen to the headphones for several hours, without getting tired, due to the lower sound pressure with complete isolation.  We still have to verify this, but looking ahead we say that it took about 2-3 days to get used to it.  Much actually depends on the ear structure, which is individual. <br><br>  By design, both models are identical to each other - the only difference is in the inscriptions on the headphone housings.  It‚Äôs good that Etymotic is faithful to traditions, especially decades ago the manufacturer actually managed to create an attractive design.  But we are not here to describe which headphones are beautiful, let's move on to the sound, because by this criterion the devices turn out to be completely different. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd3/b6a/cbd/fd3b6acbdf2a4d1a613106b5f2481fae.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7c6/b54/cda/7c6b54cdadcfd23bb9e3085d7699602e.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Sound </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1f/b8d/d31/a1fb8dd319e7af60a2581d10a6ba402e.jpg"><br><br>  Paired with Astell &amp; Kern AK 70 and <a href="http://etymoticrus.ru/cat/%3Fmodel%3Der4">ER4SR, and ER4XR</a> proved to be very good, although in general they can be shaken from a more budget player.  If you insert the earphones as deeply as possible, in both cases an excellent noise isolation is achieved, so literally you are left alone with the music.  In the subway music is heard perfectly, and if you are surrounded by several workers with jackhammers, the situation is unlikely to change. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c61/ad9/a61/c61ad9a61af518950cb802ca88cb1811.jpg"><br><br>  It is best to start right away with the most interesting - the differences.  ER4SR produces a smooth, but at the same time dynamic sound, the legendary accuracy of the ER4 can really be traced in this reincarnation of the model, as well as the characteristic monitorability.  The frequency response of this version is smoother than that of the ER4XR, there is a slight rise after 2,000 kHz.  Distortion if there is, then already at the very top, only few will be able to catch it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/305/ba5/279/305ba5279f2b5a3631f1875d49e22f19.png"><br><br>  But ER4XR seemed to be created specifically for those who were unhappy with the lack of bass in previous models.  In this version of the bass abound, the fullness of low frequencies is carried out by a smooth transition, and not just the usual rise on bottoms.  The frequency response is less even, the owners claim that the XR is slightly larger than the SR, but in order to recognize them, you need to have a really sharp ear.  It is impossible to buy blindly for sure: you need to listen to each model in advance and find out which one will be more to your liking.  Here, by the way, measurements on XR and SR separately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/076/c5f/8f3/076c5f8f355195c00a9f407d795b11e6.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Etymotic ER4SR</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d3/545/fc5/1d3545fc56407250a155d21a893b374a.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Etymotic ER4XR</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f5a/bb9/9bb/f5abb99bb33c379e539930bc7eae2b3d.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Etymotic ER4SR</font></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f1d/36d/322/f1d36d322004b1da40fe211478146470.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Etymotic ER4XR</font></i> <br><br>  The XR sound is clearly more voluminous and detailed, the upper frequencies are slightly more distinguished, but the SR impresses with evenness and full sound, while both models are distinguished by decent accuracy, for which at one time they loved the ER4S.  So the choice here is not made by the characteristics, since the model is essentially the same, and the sound variations are completely different.  We have liked the <a href="http://etymoticrus.ru/cat/%3Fmodel%3Der4">ER4XR more</a> , but here, again, we should rely only on our own feelings.  The cost of both models is almost the same, and both roll over 20 thousand rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32c/7fc/273/32c7fc273df5c16b92e39fdfc1d68e8d.jpg"><br><br><h2>  No longer pioneers </h2><br>  Nevertheless, it is not for nothing that Etymotic is famous for its achievements among headphones - the manufacturer knows, as it were, in advance what kind of sound 99% of buyers need (knowingly, he is an innovator in the field of sound prostheses).  Pioneers of these guys can not be called, glad that the company was expected to be able to repeat the success of past models.  The main indicator of success, of course, will be customer reviews, but from what we have already found on the network, you can create a positive picture.  Some may be deterred by the price, but in this case it is justified, and there is no 50 percent overpayment for the brand, as is often the case.  And who in our time will surprise you with the phrase that you need to pay for high-quality sound. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370661/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370661/</a></p>
