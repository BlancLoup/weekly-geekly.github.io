On May 14, 2007, the European Parliament approved a declaration on the third industrial revolution, supporting Rifkin‚Äôs ideas on the proliferation of hydrogen fuel cells for energy storage from renewable sources and the development of smart energy networks. <br><br>  Rifkin spoke at the Open Innovations in Moscow forum. <blockquote>  When I studied history, I realized that Russia has excellent cultural DNA.  In Russia, the first man went into space.  Recall the achievements of Vernadsky, discoveries in engineering and physics.  Russia is able to take the appropriate place in innovation.  But all innovations will not make sense if they rely on fossil energy resources and nuclear energy. </blockquote><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/9da/ea7/dbf/9daea7dbf6f6f5d008ea83b86f6a580b.png" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8">Jeremy Rifkin</a> is an American social philosopher, economist, writer and social activist.  He is the author of the concept of the ‚Äúthird industrial revolution‚Äù and consultant to a number of politicians, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel.  He has written the books "European Dream", "The Age of Access" and "The Age of Biotech". <br><br>  Speech by Jeremy Rifkin began with the fact that he spoke about the reduction in the rate of growth of gross domestic product in the whole world.  This is due to a decrease in productivity.  Unemployment is rising among young people.  Experts believe that GDP will also grow slowly for another twenty years.

      In the current financial crisis, there is a natural crisis.  The issue of climate change is on the agenda.  Experts argue a lot about the factors that caused the five waves of global extinction, but now we are on the crest of the sixth wave, which is caused by human activity.  Half of all living beings on Earth will disappear in five generations. <br><br>  There were two industrial revolutions.  To save the lives of many creatures and create a decent future for us - we need an economic vision for new realities, a new economic plan.  Such paradigm changes have occurred.  Jeremy Rifkin noted that the Open Innovations forum will discuss a roadmap of how Russia will help the world change. <br><br>  New communication technologies, along with other components, are changing the way we fulfill our needs.  We are creating technologies, building infrastructure, working on new energy sources and new transportation solutions. <br><br>  The industrial revolution took place in Britain with the transition of the economy of England from the agrarian-feudal to the industrial-capitalist one.  Steam cars and railways improved communication.  The second industrial revolution occurred in the United States, when centralized electricity generation appeared and telephone lines spread.  Henry Ford at this stage increased the mobility of people. <br><br>  In the future, the cost of oil has grown to 158 dollars in July 2008. And collapsed.  Passed the peak of the price of this energy source.  We see the same in many sectors of the economy today - the same decline. <br><br>  We are in the center of the new revolution.  When Angela Merkel became the chancellor, she invited Jeremy Rifkin to Berlin to talk about the economic power of Germany.  Rifkin said that on the existing platform with internal combustion engines and gasoline, the country has already reached its peak. <br><br>  Rifkin named three performance factors.  This is the capital for the purchase of equipment, the effectiveness of the units and communication.  The existing communication technologies, plus renewable energy sources, plus transportation ‚Äî this could be the basis of a new platform.  With the help of Big Data technology, we will all be connected by 2030. <br><br>  The new economy is based on sharing and production.  Three billion people are both consumers and producers at the same time.  Thousands of new innovative start-ups appear, they create platforms, applications and provide this kind of economy. <br><br>  Let's look at Germany with the arrival of Merkel.  The costs of using renewable energy are falling.  Solar and wind develop, technologies become cheaper.  The sun and wind bills do not send.  This energy can be used to develop the Internet of things, increasing its efficiency. <br><br>  Mobility of the population continues to grow.  Already there is no need to have your own car - <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/17282/">you can use them together</a> .  Today there are huge traffic jams on the streets, but what awaits us in the future?  80% of vehicles will be joint, cars will use electricity, will continue the development of 3D printing.  Already have the opportunity to use <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/264602/">unmanned vehicles</a> .  We are moving to a world where there will be a general economy, where the young people who are engaged in production will exchange property.  Capitalism will continue to exist, but it will not enjoy exclusive property rights. <br><br>  Analytics based on mobile devices will reduce costs.  Technology will use less energy and produce more output.  The sharing of cars and other property leads to cyclicality in the economy. <br><br>  Jeremy Rifkin spoke separately about Russia, because the event itself takes place in Moscow.  Russia has enormous energy resources, according to experts, Russia has five times more renewable energy sources than is needed on a national scale. <blockquote>  When I studied history, I realized that Russia has excellent cultural DNA.  In Russia, the first man went into space.  Recall the achievements of Vernadsky, discoveries in engineering and physics.  Russia is able to take the appropriate place in innovation.  But all innovations will not make sense if they rely on fossil energy resources and nuclear energy. </blockquote>  Over the next century, we must move to a different platform.  Large companies understand this and expand the portfolio of innovative solutions. <br><br>  At the St. Petersburg International Economic Summit, Vladimir Putin said that it was necessary to use new forms of energy.  For Russia, Germany and China to help the world pave the way for the third industrial revolution, we need to do this.  We must develop the entrepreneurial spirit of nations and produce a huge number of new jobs, Rifkin said.  In the end, we will hope for a new generation, a generation of the Internet, which is ready for a new world.  "I hope that the new generation will be able to create and flourish on our planet." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295810/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295810/</a></p>
