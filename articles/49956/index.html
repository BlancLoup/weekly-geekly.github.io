  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Startup behind glass - minds are invited. Part 2</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It must be said that the first post attracted the attention of the community, collecting under two hundred comments.  And I received a personal message on three pages.  For all this, I am very grateful.  But more on that later.  First about the project. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  There was some criticism that I myself do not know what I want.  That I want something abstract.  But it is nice that some saw in which direction I bow.  And even called a similar project - <a href="http://ning.com/">ning.com</a> .  It really looks like something I would like to create.  This is what I want to discuss. <br><br>  Obviously, users are becoming more active every day.  And many already lack widespread services.  LJ is only blogs, Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki is only communication.  And many would like to build their own small niche social programs, to gather their community.  Especially when there is a service that allows you to do this without special knowledge, the involvement of specialists and investments. <br>  The whole difficulty, in my opinion, is to correctly determine which services should be included in the project.  And it is convenient to implement it.  The last time I freely listed the most demanded functionality (from blogs, circles, ratings to customized topics).  But here the risk of subjectivism is very great - one person can mix so much that is unnecessary into porridge that no one wishes to deal with it later.  Therefore, in order not to spread over a long time, I immediately formulate the task for the first stage and invite you to solve it: <br><br>  - it is necessary to list and briefly describe the basic necessary functionality.  Some rudiments I have.  Next, I am going to work them out with those who have responded or will still respond to personal ones, and put them in the next post for general critical discussion - weed out the excess, add the missing and prioritize.  Then we will spend the first portion of finances on the preparation of technical documentation, which, again, will be presented to the community court.

      Now for the feedback received.  Everyone who offered their participation - thanks.  Who did not have time to answer - I will answer, everything was read.  We will assemble the core of developers as soon as we describe the project and determine the scope of work.  I am glad that people responded, having, judging by the portfolio, good development experience. <br>  But while communicating, a somewhat unexpected fact surfaced for me - many perceived me as a person who wanted to ‚Äúbuy a startup‚Äù.  I was shown / expressed projects / ideas, some of which are interesting - from the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãpoker social sphere to navigation service, tied to a network of mobile operators.  What is surprising, I was shown two projects that are very similar in concept to what I would like to implement. <br>  One was allowed to look and feel under the invite, promised that until the end of the month it would be opened and announced on Habrahabr (Although a week remained, such periods almost always linger) <br>  The second project is ready.  This is (url show with permission) klub.ua.  In terms of functionality, it is much simpler and seems to be focused on b2b, the potential of which I do not dare to evaluate yet.  But there is an API.  And in this project I was asked to ‚Äúinfiltrate‚Äù. <br>  In general, it is certainly more reasonable - to reduce the risks, buy already ready and modify it according to their ideas.  But in this case, the meaning of the action is lost - to think over and implement the project with the critical and demanding participation of the collective mind.  And the goal was just such. <br>  Definitely pleased that I'm not the only one looking in this direction. <br><br>  So, the <b>question of the day</b> - what do you think should be a ning-like project in order to be in demand?  What should be added?  Or just a better and more modern implementation? <br><br>  <b>PS</b> Morning warm-up for the brain - what word would you come up with to call such projects?  ‚ÄúNing-shaped‚Äù sounds unsuccessful, social, bloghosting, etc.  - not quite fit. <br><br>  <b>PPS</b> Or maybe I'm wrong, and it is worth trying to buy one of the projects, ‚Äúbuy a startup‚Äù?  And to develop it collectively? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49956/</a></p>
