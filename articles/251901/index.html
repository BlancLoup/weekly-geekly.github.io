      Very convenient and understandable transport system.  From one part of the city to the other one can be reached by any public transport, both on the subway and on a two-tier bus with a minimum number, and sometimes without any transfers.  It is important to note that in Singapore, in contrast to many other large industrial cities with a population of over one million, there is a very high level of security, be it the center of the city or the outskirts.  Locals are very friendly and friendly, respectful to all visiting visitors to the city.  Here you can meet people from almost all corners and parts of the World. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/936/777/c53/936777c5301143928ae2b01629225518.jpg"><br><br><h4>  University </h4><br>  Acquaintance with the University began with a visit to the academic campus - this is a large, separate part of the territory, which includes various faculties, administrative, business centers and technology parks, sports grounds, public catering centers, medical centers, everything that every person needs in everyday life. life without a long break from study or work.  Inside the academic campus, special university buses run, equipped with an electronic geolocation system, by installing a mobile application for which you can accurately navigate in time so as not to be late for the desired bus.  In general, what is especially striking is the widespread introduction of various information systems in the learning process and daily activities.  This is one of the main missions of the University and the task of the Faculty of Information Technologies, namely the development and implementation of innovative solutions in society, designed to create the necessary conditions for successful activity and prosperity not only of the University, but also beyond.  Therefore, so often there are various kinds of international and inter-university conferences, contests, meetings and conversations with famous and successful people in their field.  The Faculty of Information Technology itself is also one of the main pride of the University, as it not only occupies a leading position in all of Asia, but is also included in the world ranking of the top 10 best universities in the world in terms of education and information technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/494/770/423/4947704232ae4cc48099ac9edd198e55.jpg"><br><br>  My studies at the Faculty of Information Technology began with orientation week, where I had the opportunity to visit any classes and choose the most interesting and suitable subjects in my <a href="http://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/graduates/m_application.html">area of</a> study.  Of the variety, I chose the following courses: System Security, Topics in System Security, Business in Software, Data Structures and Algorithms.  Following the results of the past semester, in brief, I can say that the training is very exciting, intensive, which includes not only inter-semester exams and individual tasks, but also a lot of attention is devoted to working in groups, protecting projects and presenting their solutions.  Tasks are initially set at a very high level, for the most part, based on the latest research and advances in information technology.  In projects and assignments, the main emphasis is on the use of free software, for the protection of which the principle of competitiveness is applied, and the evaluation is carried out not only by the teacher and his assistants, but also by university students. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a80/503/f57/a80503f57b9e4fd08bef96c4fd35d8d4.jpg"><br><br>  Summarizing, without exaggeration, it becomes clear why for the citizens of Singapore, this University is one of the main attractions, since it is here that great efforts are made to conduct research and create innovative solutions and industries in various fields of activity for the whole country. <br><br><h4>  How to get a grant </h4><br>  Innopolis University - a new Russian university specializing in education in IT and robotics, is being built in partnership with leading <a href="http://university.innopolis.ru/about/international-co-operation/">IT universities in the world</a> .
