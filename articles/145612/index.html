Just know that you can‚Äôt avoid meeting long lines.  You will <i>surely</i> come across them at some stage of your activity, and you will have to solve problems that arise.

      Fortunately, there are several relatively simple things you can do to save yourself from defeat.  The problems caused by long lines can be easily seen <i>(with the help of an oscilloscope. - <b>Approx. Transl.</b> )</i> , And then I clearly, with a lot of pictures, try to show you what happens to the signals of different frequencies in different transmission lines. <br><br>  Here, for example, the oscillogram of the signal at the cable output: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/efc/7b5/bcd/efc7b5bcd5087dc716cef6c2ac13f14c.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 1. The signal at the line output without taking special measures.</i> <br><br>  Our beautiful signal is now disfigured. <br><br><a name="sect_theory"></a><h1>  What is the long line? </h1>  Any connection can be considered as a long line.  However, characteristic effects are not always observed.  That is why there are several definitions, which line is considered to be long.  It depends on what area you work in.  You should understand that the signal takes time to travel from one to the other end of the cable.  That's the whole point. <br><br>  In the copper wire, the signal is transmitted at a speed of about 2/3 of the speed of light (about 2 ¬∑ 10 <sup>8</sup> m / s).  This means that every 20 cm of cable will give 1 ns delay.  These numbers allow you to estimate how much you can lengthen the line before trouble begins. <br><br>  When you transmit a variable signal through a cable, at a certain frequency a situation will arise that the input voltage has already changed phase, and the signal has not yet reached the output.  In fact, the problems will begin long before the whole signal period in the cable begins to fit. <br><br>  The following long line definitions are commonly used: <br><ul><li>  a line transmitting signals of such high frequencies that the wavelength must be taken into account (Wikipedia); </li><li>  a line transmitting such a signal that a half-wave or more fits along the length of the line; </li><li>  line, the length of which fits a significant part of the wavelength. </li></ul><br>  This theory ends.  Let us show in practice what is happening, trying to use the minimum set of devices and parts. <br><br><a name="sect_setup"></a><h1>  Measuring installation </h1>  The <a href="http://osaa.dk/">OSAA</a> site kindly provided all the necessary materials.  Here is what I used: <br><ul><li>  20 meters of unshielded twisted pair of the 5th category; </li><li>  another half a meter of the same twisted pair (to show that with short cables is not so simple); </li><li>  signal generator; </li><li>  two oscillographs with a 100 MHz bandwidth; </li><li>  dual power supply; </li><li>  breadboard; </li><li>  two RJ-45 connectors. </li></ul><br>  The following scheme was assembled: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/12b/701/5a6/12b7015a674d5adc7b9f8155689c2560.png"><br>  <i>Figure 2. Line power supply circuit with low current output</i> <br><br>  The circuit is simply a 74HC04 inverter loaded on a cable.  The power supply voltage is 5 V. The oscilloscope No. 1 is connected to the IN_SIG / IN_GND points, and the oscilloscope No. 2 is connected to the OUT_SIG / OUT_GND.  It is important to note that the oscilloscopes are <em>not connected to a common ground</em> .  Connecting their common wires together will mean shorting the line.  An Rterm resistor, called a <em>terminator</em> , can be connected or disconnected.  When Rterm is disabled, the line is called <em>open</em> or <em>non-terminated</em> . <br><br>  The second circuit is a cascade with a high-current output.  Several 74HC04 inverters are connected in parallel, each equipped with a current-leveling resistor of 10 ohms.  This should provide a current of up to several hundred milliamps.  This scheme simulates the power line from special driver chips. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/003/9e0/f98/0039e0f9895d77402afea8e7c10b7bd9.png"><br>  <i>Figure 3. Line power supply circuit with high current output</i> <br><br>  <em>Note:</em> diagrams are for illustration purposes only.  In real life, additional requirements may be imposed on circuits, which are described later in this article. <br><br>  The assembled installation looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c9/47b/a68/2c947ba685f47e3823b66a0736639ae7.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 4. Measuring installation</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fb/6ec/93a/9fb6ec93a82235c0278fd75fe1594009.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 5. Development board and connectors</i> <br><br>  The RJ-45 connectors, as shown in Figure 5, were connected in a special way.  The cable consists of four twisted pairs, and thus we can explore a line of greater length if we connect different pairs of cables in series.  Jumpers on the connectors connect the pairs between each other, that is, the effective cable length is quadrupled.  From the 20-meter cable turns 80-meter transmission line. <br><br>  Since most of the equipment was donated, it was a problem to find two devices of the same brand, model and version.  The cables of the oscilloscope probes used for measurements differed from each other by 30 cm in length.  As mentioned above, this introduces a delay in signal propagation through the cable.  So, if you connect one oscilloscope with different probes to the same signal source, you will notice a slight difference in the results: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/998/e37/be1/998e37be16ef06291a0f91fdd74e973b.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 6. The propagation delay caused by a 30 centimeter difference in the length of the wires</i> <br><br>  The measured delay was 1.6 ns.  This may seem a bit, but when trying to match two signals that are close to each other in time, you need to take into account the length of the cable. <br><br>  <em>Note: the</em> oscilloscope shows the resolution on the Y axis of 2 V / div and 0.2 V / div for different channels.  Both probes have a 1:10 divider, but only one of them has a special label that allows the oscilloscope to recognize the type of probe and correctly display the vertical resolution.  In fact, the resolutions of both channels are the same. <br><br>  The first measurement shows the delay introduced by 80 meters of cable.  Here, the input and output signals are fed to the same oscilloscope.  This is the only measurement where it is permissible to use a single oscilloscope, since the common wire of the line is short-circuited, as mentioned above.  Nevertheless, it is possible to show the signal delay in a simple way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fcf/55d/f78/fcf55df787caa5ce602cb6a052417819.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 7. The delay of signal propagation in the 80-meter cable (the upper channel is the input, the lower one is the output)</i> <br><br>  The enlarged image (Fig. 7, right) shows a delay of 402 ns, which corresponds to a line length of 2 ¬∑ 10 <sup>8</sup> m / s ¬∑ 402 ¬∑ 10 <sup>-9</sup> s = 80.4 m. Very close to what was expected, so we can assume The result is acceptable. <br><br><a name="sect_measurement"></a><h1>  Long line measurements </h1>  When the installation is ready, you can start the real measurements.  What happens if you apply a 100 kHz square wave to an 80-meter cable?  Answer: depends on how well you <em>agreed on the</em> line. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ca/db8/228/0cadb8228f77b392ae5bfabd3ab700f8.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 8. Cable 80 m, signal 100 kHz, low-current line power.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Upper row: non-terminated line, on the left - the entrance, on the right - the exit.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Bottom row: the terminated line, on the left - the entrance, on the right - the exit</i> <br><br>  What's going on here?  Non-terminated cable gives a bunch of garbage, both at the output <em>and at the entrance</em> .  When the resistance of 100 ohms is connected to the cable, everything looks good.  The answer lies in the properties of the long line.  When you bring a signal to the cable, you transmit energy to the cable.  This energy spreads through it until it reaches the end, <em>which takes time</em> , and then it must come out of the cable.  However, if there is high resistance at the end of the cable, energy cannot escape from the cable and is reflected back to the input.  <i>(At too low resistance (short circuit) at the end of the line, the energy is also reflected, only the phase of the reflected signal will be different. - <b>Appro. Transl.</b> )</i> <br><br>  Some of you may have seen a rope experiment in a physics lesson in school.  You take the rope, fix it with one end against the wall, stretch it and swing the free end.  You can see that the impulse sent along the rope reaches the wall, is reflected and runs back.  The long line does the same thing, only with electricity. <br><br>  Any long line has a parameter called line <em>impedance</em> .  No matter how long the cable is, it has the same characteristic impedance.  To pick up the energy that is transmitted through the cable, the end resistance must be equal to the characteristic impedance of the line.  In the case of a twisted pair is 100 ¬± 15 Ohms.  For any cable, the characteristic impedance is either known or can be measured. <br><br>  The reason for which the resistance of the terminator should be equal to the characteristic impedance of the line is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_theorem">the maximum power theorem (Jacobi theorem)</a> .  To transmit the maximum power, the internal resistances of the source and the receiver of the energy must be the same.  Any terminator whose resistance is not equal to the line impedance allows part of the energy to be reflected back into the cable from it. <br><br>  You can measure the characteristic impedance of any cable by changing the terminator's resistance (take a variable resistor) until the reflection disappears.  For the applied cable, this technique gave the result of 114 ohms.  According to the cable specification, this is within the normal range. <br><br>  If you are thinking now: ‚ÄúWhy can't I use a cable with infinite characteristic impedance?‚Äù, I have to disappoint you, because the attenuation of the signal in the cable is due to its characteristic impedance.  The higher the cable impedance becomes, the harder it is to transmit a signal through it.  Energy is absorbed by the cable, but nothing comes to the output.  Conversely, an impedance equal to zero will give a cable without attenuation (lossless), the output will have to create a short circuit, which means that the output voltage will be zero. <br><br>  <i><b>Note</b></i>  <i><b>trans .: The</b> above is not quite right.</i>  <i>Attenuation coefficient does not depend on wave resistance.</i>  <i>Both of these parameters depend on the geometric dimensions of the line and on the properties of the materials from which it is made.</i>  <i>By applying ideal conductors and insulators, it is possible to create a line without attenuation with any given characteristic impedance.</i>  <i>On the other hand, when using real materials, a higher impedance cable will have greater attenuation, ceteris paribus.</i>  <i>Another reason why high-resistance lines are not used is the difficulty of matching them with the signal source.</i> <br><br>  As can be seen from Figure 8, even a not very high-frequency 100 kHz signal is littered.  Let's raise the frequency to 1 MHz and see what happens: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a7/c5d/083/0a7c5d08363cabe891108425118b332a.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 9. Cable 80 m, 1 MHz signal, low-current line power.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Upper row: non-terminated line, on the left - the entrance, on the right - the exit.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Bottom row: the terminated line, on the left - the entrance, on the right - the exit</i> <br><br>  At high frequencies, there is a new effect.  Signal fronts are no longer steep, but of exponential form, even with proper matching.  A driver on one logical element cannot transfer energy to the cable fast enough.  Each cable has its own capacity, which is usually specified per meter or kilometer length.  According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat5e">specification, the</a> cable of the 5th category has a capacity of 52 pF / m.  With a length of 80 m, the capacity is 4.16 nF. <br><br>  Looking carefully at Figure 9 (bottom right), one can see that the front beginning is steep and almost linear.  The voltage rise on the first 1.8 V is almost linear in 40 ns.  During this short time, the output buffer of the inverter outputs a current I = (U ¬∑ C) / T = (4.16 nF ¬∑ 1.8 V) / 40 ns = 187 mA (!) <br><br>  Then follows the exponential part of the curve.  Its shape depends on the driver settings, as well as on the resistance, capacitance and inductance of the cable.  The exact calculation of this curve is a complex integral calculation, beyond the scope of this article. <br><br>  A source is required that can deliver a much higher current in order to overcome the cable capacitance and again make the waveform look like something ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.  So, once again we will carry out measurements at low and high frequencies for a high-current circuit (Fig. 3): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e76/d62/4d2/e76d624d272e264b0d3cd57ab30f9450.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 10. 80 m cable, 100 kHz signal, high current line power.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Upper row: non-terminated line, on the left - the entrance, on the right - the exit.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Bottom row: the terminated line, on the left - the entrance, on the right - the exit</i> <br><br>  Using a powerful scheme has two implications.  First, the energy pumped into the cable is much higher.  Thus, a large amount of energy will be reflected in the mismatched cable (Fig. 10, upper right).  This may cause damage to the equipment, since the output voltage is much higher than 5 V. <br><br>  Secondly, with the correct alignment, the edges of the signal are again steep and clear.  You can also see that the voltage is at an acceptable level for digital circuits of 3.8 V (Fig. 10, bottom right). <br><br>  The output voltage of the installation is limited by the resistances of the cable and the DC load.  The entire cable has a DC resistance of 2 ¬∑ 80 m ¬∑ 0.188 Œ© / m = 30 Œ©.  Please note that cable resistance consists of the resistance of <em>two</em> wires of 80 m each.  The cable together with the 100 ohm terminator form a voltage divider.  The maximum voltage at the output of the divider is 5 V ¬∑ 100 Œ© / (100 Œ© + 30 Œ©) = 3.85 V. The measured value is very close to theoretical.  Not bad for a "knee" assembly. <br><br>  Cable resistance is one of the reasons why you cannot close IN_GND and OUT_GND pins between each other (see fig. 2 and 3).  The return path from OUT_GND to IN_GND has a resistance of 15 Ohms, and the voltage drops to about 0.58 V. <br><br>  If you close the ground, you eliminate part of the cable from work and actually create an <em>earth loop</em> .  Part of the reverse current will flow through the cable, and part through the point of the circuit.  The problem, however, is that the length and properties of the cable and the shorted section are not the same, and the difference in signal propagation along these two paths will play a significant role.  That is, the <em>Bad Stuff ‚Ñ¢</em> will happen if you close the land between them. <br><br>  Consider a 1 MHz signal with a high-current driver: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d89/f09/d11/d89f09d11d1e1fc075909be9e8e2ce9d.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 11. 80 m cable, 1 MHz signal, high current line power.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Upper row: non-terminated line, on the left - the entrance, on the right - the exit.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Bottom row: the terminated line, on the left - the entrance, on the right - the exit</i> <br><br>  As can be seen from Figure 11, the signal at the output of a cable with high-current power has an acceptable shape if it is matched.  The estimated peak current is (4.16 nF ¬∑ 2.5 V) / 20 ns = 520 mA (!).  You can imagine what a huge load falls on the driver during signal transmission. <br><br>  The high impulse current required to transmit a signal through a cable is the reason for which specialized chips are used - line and bus drivers.  These chips are designed to provide very high currents for a short time without burning out.  You should also make sure that you have supplied these circuits with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/146987/">proper decoupling capacitors</a> . <br><br><a name="sect_short"></a><h1>  Short cable, big problems </h1>  So far, we have only considered long cables.  However, the feature of the long line is that its characteristic impedance does not depend on the length.  Translating into human language: even using a short cable, you can not relax. <br><br>  Remove the 20-meter cable, replace it with a half-meter piece and measure the signal propagation delay: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e5/06b/0c2/8e506b0c2458b27ccd345f2bdeebfd60.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 12. Propagation delay in the 2.3-meter line (top - input, bottom - output)</i> <br><br>  The expected delay in a 4 √ó 0.5 m cable should be about 10 ns, but measurements show a value far from the calculated one.  There are several explanations for this: <br><ul><li>  test leads have different lengths: 1.6 ns errors; </li><li>  the connectors are connected to the board with a 15 cm wire: twice 0.75 ns; </li><li>  The purple wire from the driver to the cable (Fig. 5, left) has a length of 10 cm: another 0.5 ns errors; </li><li>  The signal speed in the cable is less than 2/3 of the speed of light.  In accordance with the cable specification, about 0.64 ¬∑ s: 4% error; </li><li>  Twisted pair has a greater electrical length than the cable itself, due to the fact that the conductors go in a spiral: the quantitative difference is unknown. </li></ul><br>  Summing up these errors, except for the last one, and taking the cable length along with the leads (2.3 m), we obtain a calculated delay of 12.7 ns, which corresponds to a line length of 2.4 m. Already much closer to reality. <br><br>  What happens if a 100 kHz signal is transmitted over this not-very-long line? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/276/0de/1d5/2760de1d5297a8cae2dcc6f915f3fd0b.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 13. Cable 2.3 m, 100 kHz signal, high current line power.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Upper row: non-terminated line, on the left - the entrance, on the right - the exit.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Bottom row: the terminated line, on the left - the entrance, on the right - the exit</i> <br><br>  Answer: if you do not agree on the cable, there will be a lot of high-frequency "ringing". <br><br>  As can be seen from Figure 13 (top right), a lot of noise appears at the exit after each front.  This noise is nothing but a signal that walks back and forth along the cable, repeatedly reflected from its ends. <br><br>  The 2.3 meter cable has the same characteristic impedance as the 80 meter cable.  The ping almost disappears if you connect a resistance of 100 ohms, which means that the energy that enters the cable leaves it freely. <br><br>  The repetition of the experiment at a higher frequency allows us to better understand the reason for the "ringing": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c5/ee1/d4e/6c5ee1d4e4378c7272c95b90b9f6e09d.jpg"><br>  <i>Figure 14. Cable 2.3 m, 1 MHz signal, high current line power.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Upper row: non-terminated line, on the left - the entrance, on the right - the exit.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Bottom row: the terminated line, on the left - the entrance, on the right - the exit</i> <br><br>  In the non-terminated line, resonant oscillations occur.  The top right waveform in Figure 14 shows this.  In this case, <em>none</em> of the ends of the line is consistent.  The energy that enters the cable is reflected from its end, moves back to the beginning and is reflected again.  This leads to a resonant wave in the cable.  This wave will exist until all its energy is dissipated due to attenuation in the cable. <br><br>  The resonance frequency, according to Figure 14, is approximately 20 MHz.  The reason that this is the frequency is the length of the cable.  The propagation delay, as measured earlier, is 12.7 ns.  The period of resonant oscillations is 50 ns, that is, almost exactly 4 times longer, plus or minus the measurement error. <br><br>  The resonance frequency corresponds to the wavelength of the signal (denoted by the letter ‚Äúlambda‚Äù: Œª).  You can imagine this ‚Äúringing‚Äù as a standing wave in a cable <i>(a standing wave is a superposition of two oppositely directed traveling waves. - <b>Approx. Transl.</b> )</i> .  When you excite an oscillating system, it will resonate at a frequency where the wavelength corresponds to the length of the cable.  For resonance, a length of 1/4 Œª or a higher overtone is needed.  Useful advice: do not let your lines ‚Äúring‚Äù like this, it can damage the circuit. <br><br>  The output voltage with proper matching (Fig. 14, bottom right) is ‚Äúnormal‚Äù 5 V. In contrast to the 80-meter cable, the resistance of the DC line is very small (about 0.86 ohms).  Thus, the effect of the voltage divider, noticeable on a long cable, is not so pronounced here.  However, the input and output conductors of the earth are still not the same point, and their connections should be avoided. <br><br><a name="sect_recovery"></a><h1>  Signal recovery </h1>  Sending a signal to the cable is only half the battle, you need to turn the output signal back into something understandable.  Here are three main problems with the signal after passing through a long line: <br><ol><li>  ugly signal fronts; </li><li>  signal imbalance; </li><li>  ground level offset. </li></ol><br>  The first problem is solved by adding a buffer.  This buffer should contain <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580_%25D0%25A8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">a Schmitt trigger</a> to avoid possible undefined states during signal transmission. <br><br>  The second part is a bit more complicated.  The signal balance in digital technology is related to <i>what</i> will be interpreted as ‚Äú0‚Äù and what will be interpreted as ‚Äú1‚Äù.  Logical levels correspond to their voltage ranges, and they are quite strict and depend on the type of logic (CMOS, TTL, TTLSH, etc.).  An experiment with an 80-meter cable showed that the amplitude of the output voltage is significantly reduced.  All logic levels are proportionally reduced by the voltage divider, and they no longer meet the standards for the chips used.  Schmitt's trigger can correctly restore the signal at the receiving end only if the levels are strictly specified.  If there are deviations, they will manifest themselves in a change in the duty cycle of the received signal. <br><br>  The third problem, as was said earlier, is related to the fact that the source earth and the receiver earth are not one and the same point.  For an 80-meter cable, this most often does not pose a problem, since each side of the cable has its own independent power source.  However, when using shorter cables, a common power supply is often used, and therefore a common ground. <br><br>  It has already been said that the union of earth conductors is <em>Nasty Stuck ‚Ñ¢</em> when it comes to long lines.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You must make sure that the power supply circuits are untied into two separate areas, both along the ‚Äúhot‚Äù conductors, and along the earth </font></font><sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(*)</font></font></sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Note that you only need to decouple the power supplies to restore the signal from the long line. You may well have one global earth, but you </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">must</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> deal with local earth conductors designed for data lines. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(*): There may be exceptions if you clearly understand what you are doing.

This is done by adjusting the Rterm resistor so that the bias voltage at the cable output is somewhere in the middle between the Schmitt trigger thresholds. The threshold voltages for 74HC14 when powered from 5 V are equal: V </font></font><sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">T +</font></font></sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> = 2.4 V, V </font></font><sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">T-</font></font></sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> = 1.4 V.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It will be logical to set the divider to offset 1.9 V (midway between the thresholds), but this must be confirmed experimentally. A terminator with a setting of 1.9 V has a composite resistance of 82 Ohms, which is slightly less than the required one hundred, but still acceptable. The resistance of the power supply to the alternating current is very small, so we can assume that the upper and lower pins of the divider are interconnected by alternating current. From the point of view of the signal at the end of the cable, the upper and lower shoulders of the divider are </font></font><em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">connected in parallel</font></font></em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . Offset 1.9 V correspond to the resistance of the shoulders: 217 ohms - to the power conductor and 133 ohms - to the ground. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c4/080/6ae/1c40806ae1c88ec0a17cfa307600706e.jpg"><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Figure 16.

Figure 16 (top right) shows what happens on the inconsistent line. The pulse duration from the source, 251.4 ns, is not equal to the duration at the output of the Schmitt trigger. The output pulse is 40 ns longer or nearly 16%. If you connect several transmission lines in a cascade, then just a few stages from the signal nothing remains </font></font><i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(that is, the fill factor reaches 100% and the pauses between the pulses will disappear. - </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Approx.

A small change in frequency may have a significant impact, while other changes may be invisible. The fact that the problem is not visible is not always a sign of the absence of a problem. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Adding a terminator with an offset (Fig. 16, bottom right) results in a perfect match of the pulse durations. To restore the duty cycle, the displacement level is set at 1.81 V (instead of the theoretical 1.9 V). Perhaps this is due to a small deviation of resistance from the nominal.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In real life, you would perform several construction tests, and then recalculate all the values ‚Äã‚Äãto make sure they are correct. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Nobody needs trimming resistors in the final design, but they are usually not required. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Most schemes, if properly designed, work normally with deviations within a few percent.</font></font><br><br><a name="sect_resonance"></a><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Resonance effects </font></font></h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Reflections in a long line can cause significant problems if the input wavelength is a multiple of the cable length.

Sequential matching at the line input</font></font></i> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> When a signal is sent to the cable, it is reflected from the output and moves back to the beginning of the line. Since the input is properly matched, all energy leaves the cable without multiple reflections. In Figure 19 it can be seen that the reflection is superimposed on the useful signal only at the point IN_SIG and nowhere else.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no resonance in the cable, since there are no conditions for multiple signal reflections. Thus, the output voltage is always stable. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The main advantage of this scheme is its simplicity. The second advantage is that energy consumption is reduced. The driver is always loaded with a resistance of 100 Ohms, which limits the peak current to 50 mA (at 5 V). However, power reduction is also a disadvantage, since it does not allow you to quickly ‚Äúshake‚Äù the cable capacity. This means that the bandwidth of the line will be limited. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Another disadvantage of this circuit is that the line driver must have a low output impedance and cope with the reflected signal. In practice, protective diodes may be required to limit overvoltages.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> A few notes about the solution described: </font></font><br><ul><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">load resistance should be much greater than the line impedance. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is important because the reflection of the signal is artificially caused. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When using the Schmitt trigger (Figure 18), this does not cause difficulties. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Too low a load resistance (but still above the wave resistance) affects the desired value of the terminating resistor;</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> You can balance the output of the cable with a high impedance divider; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> this installation does not resolve land allocation issues, as discussed earlier, and you must solve them separately; </font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The installation is not insured against problems occurring near resonant frequencies. </font></font></li></ul><br><br><a name="sect_dualside"></a><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Bilateral negotiation </font></font></h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As follows from the theory, and as described in the previous paragraph, the line should be consistent at the beginning and at the end. Why not do it? </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Additional resistance makes signal recovery challenging. It has already been said that 80 meters of cable with a 100-ohm terminator will give a maximum output voltage of just 3.85 V due to the effect of a voltage divider. The introduction of an additional resistor at the beginning of the cable for matching on both sides will reduce the output voltage to 5 V ¬∑ 100 Ohms / (100 Ohms + 100 Ohms + 30 Ohms) = 2.17 V. With such an amplitude, the Schmitt trigger threshold (2.4 B) will never be reached, and the signal will disappear. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A short cable will give you 2.5 V at best, which does not leave a large margin for stable operation.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Transmitting a digital signal requires that the minimum amplitude at the cable's output comply with the specification. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no other way to achieve this, except for the use of additional circuits for signal amplification.</font></font><br><br><a name="sect_power"></a><h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Isolation of power </font></font></h1><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Several times in this article the problem of earthen loops was emphasized.

Unfortunately, this problem is simply formulated, but does not have a simple solution. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The best solution is to ensure that the earth's conductors cannot connect, even through the hull, screen, or external ground.
