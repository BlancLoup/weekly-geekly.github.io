The German company <b><a href="https://www.boschrexroth.com/ru/ru/">Bosch Rexroth is</a></b> known throughout the world, but this does not prevent it from continuing to work on optimizing business processes.  The problems of warehouse accounting, familiar to each organization, also affected the Russian representation of this company with a large office and logistics center in the city of Khimki, Moscow Region. <br><br>  <a href="http://scanport.ru/"><b>The Scanport team was</b></a> assigned a responsible task - to automate the main warehouse processes at the company's large logistics warehouse.  We present a case with a detailed description of the key points and results of our work. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Bosch Rexroth products are electric drives, conveyor lines, control systems, etc." src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ql/0h/9x/ql0h9x1geayyj0xoji8sssi6lss.jpeg" alt="Bosch Rexroth   :      "></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What problems had to be solved </h2><br>  <b>Bosch Rexroth</b> is engaged in the manufacture and maintenance of specialized equipment: electric drives, hydraulic components, assembly and conveyor lines, control systems.  The company's products are of different sizes, which complicates their storage and movement.  But it was, as shown by a business survey at the facility, not the only problem.

    <ul><li>  Due to improperly organized acceptance, the goods were not in their places, which subsequently hampered their search. </li><li>  Employees spent a lot of time manually distributing storage locations. </li><li>  Due to irrational use a significant part of the area was idle. </li><li>  Inventory took a lot of time, accompanied by staff errors. </li><li>  Orders were completed manually, it took a lot of effort to find the right positions in the list (and it was not always successful). </li><li>  Errors also occurred at the packaging / labeling stage, which adversely affected the company's reputation due to a large percentage of returns. </li></ul><br><h2>  What are the priorities </h2><br>  The business survey showed that difficulties arise mainly due to the lack of an address storage system and automated inventory accounting (TMC).  With its introduction, according to forecasts, it was possible to solve almost all problems.  Therefore, we set ourselves the following tasks: <br><br><ol><li>  Organize convenient and ergonomic storage of goods and materials. </li><li>  Reduce the timing of the inventory. </li></ol><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Well, you can take inventory here without automation. But to produce the necessary books without address storage ..." src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zc/im/vo/zcimvoi3dbxmrq9rhs2ponqel40.jpeg" alt="     "></div><br><br><h2>  What we have offered to the management of the Bosch Rexroth warehouse </h2><br>  Before offering anything, we carefully studied the business processes, defined the requirements for the organization of the office and warehouse complex, described the algorithms and developed the warehouse topology.  As a result, we recommended equipment and software for automation, which was optimally suited for the implementation of the tasks: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile/"><b>Software DataMobile</b></a> with flexible settings and ease of use; </li><li>  Honeywell Dolphin 6500 data collection terminals, as well as a modification of the Honeywell Dolphin 75e based on the Android OS. </li></ul><br><h3>  What we have achieved: short for each task </h3><br>  <u><b>1. Simple and effective address storage (acceptance, labeling, placement).</b></u> <br>  We marked each object with internal labels printed on a mobile printer.  Now the goods arriving at the warehouse automatically receive a specific storage address - this information is displayed in the accounting system. <br><br>  Articles of goods and materials on production labels are used in the future for initial product search in the program and labeling with bar codes.  This work no longer needs to be done manually.  Large deliveries in this scheme can be taken in stages, attracting several operators, which increases the productivity of the warehouse. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="The application of bar codes has simplified many business processes, including the search for goods in a large warehouse." src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_o/43/w4/_o43w42harrucetat7jmxvsl7jq.jpeg" alt="   ‚Äì    "></div><br><br>  <u><b>2. Easy and error-free movement of goods in the warehouse.</b></u> <br>  Each address storage location has its own barcode fixed in the system, therefore internal movement of goods no longer causes difficulties and does not create confusion.  The main thing is to work with the TSD and record the changes in the location of inventories. <br><br>  <u><b>3. Fast and efficient inventory.</b></u> <br>  <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile/"><b>DataMobile software</b></a> performs inventory in three steps. <br><br>  Initial - general recalculation of objects by storage. <br>  The second stage takes place in areas where discrepancies with the accounting amount are found. <br>  If there are still inconsistencies after that, they are clarified at the third stage. <br><br>  This approach increased the accuracy of the inventory, and the introduction of automated tools seriously reduced the number of errors due to the human factor and reduced the time for inventory. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="With the introduction of new software, the inventory has become easier, faster, and the percentage of errors has decreased significantly" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c6/lb/lu/c6lblu8azm5y9wfrhkm2bptj-9i.jpeg" alt=", , ?  !     "></div><br><br>  <u><b>4. Simplified formation of orders.</b></u> <br>  Assembly orders are generated automatically - using the TSD, which reads the bar codes of the storage locations.  To collect the names in a separate area, there is no need for a long time to search for the goods by cell: the system itself will tell you what is stored. <br><br>  <u><b>Full set of orders.</b></u> <br>  So, the goods for the order are collected.  <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/"><b>DataMobile</b></a> system helps to form and fill the packaging space, taking into account the characteristics of weight and size.  All is ready?  The TSD will check the correctness of the assembly when packing products: returns due to incorrect picking of the order are excluded! <br><br>  Look at the updated warehouse business processes in practice, see in the video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTIuBt_TCDw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  How we did it: technical details </h2><br><ul><li>  To implement the project, our team created a separate outline of warehouse documents and reference books in the Bosch Rexroth product accounting system. </li><li>  We ensured the uninterrupted operation of the Wi-Fi network throughout the office and logistics center so that each employee could receive a task in the system at any time and fulfill it. </li><li>  <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile/"><b>Software DataMobile</b></a> takes into account the new automated storage system at the customer‚Äôs warehouse <b>‚ÄúModula‚Äù</b> , tasks for the TSD can be sent to the addresses of this system.  This expanded the possibilities of automation and made it possible to reduce the cost of purchasing new equipment. </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="Three whales warehouse automation - software DataMobile, Honeywell TSD and Wi-Fi" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gz/x5/gu/gzx5gurleawlom28lc1u42sgrfk.jpeg" alt="       Wi-Fi"></div><br><br><h2>  results </h2><br>  The following goals have been achieved with the introduction of an address storage system based on <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile/"><b>DataMobile software</b></a> in the <b>Bosch Rexroth</b> warehouse center: <br><br><ul><li>  The whole process of distribution of goods - acceptance, movement, formation of the order - is taken under control by marking all goods and materials with bar codes. </li><li>  Inventories are conducted with more accurate results due to several stages of reconciliation. </li><li>  All business processes - from acceptance and marking to shipping and inventory - are carried out in a short time. </li><li>  The number of shortages and regradings decreased, which had a positive effect on the overall balance and profitability of the company. </li><li>  Formation of analytical reports for the KPI system is on stream. </li><li>  Assisted management in the organization of an effective system of staff motivation. </li></ul><br>  Thus, almost any warehouse can be automated.  <a href="http://data-mobile.ru/datamobile/"><b>Software for automation</b></a> copes with its task, and we will help you find the right equipment, implement it and adjust the process. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342606/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342606/</a></p>
