This plug'n'play device, which on the one hand connects to the operator‚Äôs macro network via the Internet (for example, over the local office network), and on the other hand provides cellular coverage within its range. <br><br>  Simply put, it is a small custom cell that is connected to the operator‚Äôs network over the Internet.  It can provide special tariffs in its coverage area and provide coverage where it is difficult or impossible to obtain it by other methods, plus provide a number of special services.  Coverage can be used by everyone or, for example, according to the list of permitted SIMs.  Femtocell is taken from the operator and placed at home, in the office or somewhere else where all these services are needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0800bfdb/1b087bd1/b9822851/9111d142.jpg"><br>  <sup>Home device</sup>

    <h4>  Why would such a thing be useful to me? </h4><br>  ‚Ä¢ For offices (discounts and local telephony) <br>  ‚Ä¢ For various events (to improve coverage) <br>  ‚Ä¢ For hard-to-reach places (remote objects or network access in the interference area) <br>  ‚Ä¢ In "smart homes" <br>  ‚Ä¢ To control access (for example, informing you that a child has come from school) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  What are femtocells? </h4><br>  There are Home Femto for home use, Enterprise Femto for small and medium businesses and Outdoor Femto for outdoor use. <br><br>  <b>Here are the indicators for one of the manufacturers of femto points:</b> <ul><li>  Home Femto: maximum power 10-20 mW, 4-8 simultaneous voice calls / packet sessions, DL / UL 7.2 - 14.4 / 5.7 Mbps. </li><li>  Enterprise Femto: maximum power up to 100 mW, 8-32 simultaneous voice calls / packet sessions, DL / UL 7.2 - 14.4 / 5.7 Mbps. </li><li>  Outdoor Femto: maximum power up to 250 mW, 16-32 simultaneous voice calls / packet sessions, DL / UL 7.2 - 14.4 / 5.7 Mbps. </li></ul>  One femtocell can provide coverage of up to 1000 square meters, however, the more partitions / walls in a room, the more attenuated the signal from the femto point is and, accordingly, the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe femtocell decreases. <br><br>  <b>Schematically femtocell looks like this:</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/f252dae5/b8abf5df/70bd7137/daddde78.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Coverage improvement </h4><br>  For both private and corporate customers, the femtocell primarily improves the quality of 3G coverage, where necessary (first floors of buildings, basements, factory premises, warehouses, offices outside the city), and also saves subscribers from the problems associated with network overload during peak hours. <br><blockquote>  Example: you can deploy such a cell in the office or in a warehouse without a 3G coverage and get it in place. </blockquote><br><h4>  Additional services and reduced rates </h4><br>  Femto allows you to provide subscribers with a number of useful additional services, such as, for example, a local discount on calls through a femtocell.  In the ‚Äúhome zone‚Äù defined by the femtocell range, calls to subscribers can be provided with a substantial discount, as well as practically free mobile Internet. <br><blockquote>  You can put a cell in the office and call with a substantial discount.  If during a call to go beyond the cell, the call will still be charged at the starting point of the call. </blockquote><br><h4>  Access control </h4><br>  Private and corporate clients will certainly be interested in the SMS alert service about the registration of certain subscribers in the femtocell. <br><blockquote>  Example: a cell may report the arrival of your child from school or the time of arrival and departure of employees. </blockquote><br><h4>  Synchronization and local social networks </h4><br>  Femtocell-based services can provide content synchronization services on mobile and stationary devices, plus provide other technology-based services. <br><blockquote>  When a subscriber enters home and registers with a femtocell, all changes made on his smartphone (contact list, photos, videos, etc.) are automatically synchronized with a desktop computer through the operator‚Äôs appserver and applications on local devices.  This is useful for owners of "smart home". </blockquote><br><h4>  PBX </h4><br>  For corporate users, it is possible to provide a mini-PBX service, as well as a number of other office telephony and data transfer services. <br><blockquote>  Properly configured honeycomb solves the problems of receiving calls in small call-centers and sets the rules for the transfer, plus implements another functional PBX. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7f555086/afe7708d/5c5fbfce/ea67b9d2.jpg"><br>  <sup>Corporate femtocell</sup> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8bd53bc3/26482500/af2dcc1f/b25ec56c.jpg"><br>  <sup>Femto Cell</sup> <br><br><h4>  When can I buy one for myself? </h4><br>  Now the femtocell networks are deployed in trial operation in the Central and North-West region, in 2012 it is planned to commercially operate the femto networks.  Also in 2012, subscribers of the Moscow region will be able to use femto cells. <br><br>  At the first stage of the network deployment, the femto offer will be mainly focused on improving coverage of corporate customers, while non-corporate subscribers will also have the opportunity to install a femtocell at home. <br><br>  As the femto network is being deployed, the range of services based on femto cells will expand and the range of femto cells for home users will increase (a built-in Wi-Fi router, a set-top box will appear).  In the future, it is planned to use them for the organization of 3G networks - in remote small towns, in areas of the city where it is difficult to organize to serve standard base stations and so on. <br><br><h4>  Already someone uses them? </h4><br>  Yes, femto networks already work for the largest European, Asian and American operators, such as Vodafone UK, Telefonica, StarHub, NTT DoCoMo, Softbank Mobile, Verizone, Sprint. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129424/</a></p>
