Of course, there are failures, but if we compare it with many other non-moderated social network resources, progress is clearly evident.  At the same time, the trend of intelligence over the period of my work with this site has only intensified.  And in fact, with whom you lead ... <br><br>  The number of participants in the community is constantly growing, there have been, there are more and more interesting authors and interlocutors.  Many of them parallel with Habrom keep their blogs in their own resources and / or on popular blogging platforms.  For the overwhelming majority, Live Journal is the last one.

      However, interestingly, for some reason, there is a clear tendency to suppress one‚Äôs involvement in Habr.  In any third-party profile, if you specify your own blog, then this is usually anything, but not a blog on Habr√©.  Shy or what?  And if so, what, exactly? <br><br><h4>  A bit about karma and traditions </h4><br>  They began to talk less and less about karma.  Maybe only sob about her or dare to criticize her newcomer to immediately get a reminder from the old-timers that this business card of the resource "is either good or not at all."  At the same time remind you that you cannot beg for karma.  These postulates, as well as the collective shout of ‚Äúhabracut‚Äù, turned into a kind of school for the young Habraboeyc. <br><br>  There are also some other entertaining traditions.  Many like these habratraditsii, some do not.  However, as you know, tastes do not argue ... And the presence of traditions, no matter how you treat them, is, nevertheless, a characteristic sign of the maturity of any social community. <br><br><h4>  Trusting on the laurels, or I said everything </h4><br>  The resource has not yet formed an institution of experts, carriers of the collective wisdom of its participants.  I do not know why, but at some point, many owners of high karma sharply slow down their activity.  They are less likely to be ‚Äúprinted‚Äù and less and less involved in the discussion of other speeches. <br><br>  "I said everything."  It seems that, precisely, the temporary leaders themselves come to this conclusion.  New "activists" are replacing such "all who have said", so that after a short time, relying on their laurels, give way to the next "generation" of troublemakers.  So, "hello, the tribe is young, unfamiliar" is like a refrain of all habrawan existence. <br><br><h4>  Collective portrait in Habrav interior </h4><br>  A typical habrazhdrazhdanin seems to me as a young man aged 20‚Äì25 years old who proudly calls himself an IT person.  From Russia or its near abroad.  He is studying at a technical college or has recently graduated from it.  From childhood to ‚Äúyou‚Äù with a computer, on the Internet it feels like a fish in water.  Familiar with his technology and tools;  he built himself or is going to build his own social network resource.  Already by virtue of his own age, he is not burdened with excessively deep fundamental knowledge and work experience.  The fact that such industrial programming and real business, as a rule, can only be heard.  There are exceptions, of course, and in very different directions, but they, these exceptions, it seems to me, only confirm the painted portrait of the typical Habr resident.  One of the most conspicuous, from my point of view, the exception is a large group of Russian-speaking "foreigners." <br><br>  Themes on Habr√© are the most diverse.  However, among the prevailing themes, I would nevertheless single out the Internet-related ones and, above all, with its social networking services.  A lot of attention is also paid to startups.  At the same time, the latter, like other popular issues affecting business here, again, in many respects, revolve around the same ‚Äúsocial sphere‚Äù.  Sometimes it even occurs to the thought that, suddenly, disappear these services, their technologies, methods, design and tools, but I will fight somewhere the content of Habr will decrease by an order of magnitude. <br><br><h4>  About professorship at Habr√© </h4><br>  There are very few professors both literally and figuratively in Habr√©.  They often look here like the white crows and usually do not stay long. <br>  Not so much, according to my observations, here are top managers and decision-makers.  Perhaps it is precisely from this that the purely pragmatic, momentary and personified interest in information - ‚Äúcame, saw, ... applied.‚Äù <br><br>  One of my acquaintances (in the literal sense) in a conversation with me so directly stated: ‚ÄúReal professionals do not participate in discussions on social networking resources‚Äù.  Of course, he is mistaken.  Enterprise 2.0 and other current trends in the development of the Internet are a clear indication of this.  However, even realizing his delusion, will he become an active resident of Habr?  And if, after all, he and his like pessimists come to Habr, will their students and employees not leave the resource in this case?  Why do these different categories of potential users fail to coexist in parallel worlds of one resource?  Worlds that intersect only when it is beneficial, useful or interesting for both participants.  How to make an intelligent resource become at the same time a resource for intellectuals? <br><br>  <i>Questions, questions, questions ... For some reason, Habrahabr today somehow reminds me of a famous fairy-tale hero at a crossroads: go to the right, old users can be lost;</i>  <i>you will go to the left, a large influx of new users can hardly be expected.</i>  <i>I would choose the ‚Äúright‚Äù way, but this is my personal, and, as I said, very subjective opinion ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>PS It seems, however, that the owners of this popular resource (now superHabra) have chosen the ‚Äúleft‚Äù path, which in reality is a continuation of the old one.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Let me remind you that the full text of this note is in my <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D112982">iTech Bridge-blog</a> .</i> <br><br>  <b>ps And the rating system they seem to have stopped working at all.</b>  <b>Judge for yourself.</b>  <b>In the old version I had a karma of 53.69, habrasila - 55.32 and rating - about 280. After that, a month later I published only ONE note!</b>  <b>The result is obvious!</b>  <b>Apparently, having changed the scale of polls in the new version, they did not even try to somehow count the karma and habrasil from the old users.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/36924/">https://habr.com/ru/post/36924/</a></p>
