Why and who is there?  Learn about SCADA exploits in US prisons?  Look at the flight of woodpeckers in the Mayan jungle?  All truth from one of the summit participants in this post. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/378/ff8/313/378ff831315ea4d8005a44b206892911.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Today I would like to tell you about such an event as <a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/sas2012">Security Analyst Sammit</a> .  This is a young conference organized by Kaspersky Lab for the fourth time ... or the fifteenth - depending on how you count it.  The constant chip of konfa is the communication of experts in the field of computer security in an informal setting: not just without a tie, but right in beach slippers, shorts and Hawaii.  This year we decided to hold an event in the winter, and there was a problem with beach slippers, which no one wanted to refuse.  Therefore, it was decided to fly closer to the equator, and the choice fell on the Yucatan Peninsula.  By the way, it was previously inhabited by precisely those same Indians with a vulnerable calendar: in December of this year, a buffer overflow occurred, but the universe did not fall, and did not even hang, which is good news.

As you understand, the choice of participants who are ready to work in such inhuman conditions is not a simple matter.  This year there were specialists from a dozen companies, including Adobe, Boeing, CrySyS Lab (guys who found DuQU), Kaspersky Lab (well, without us;)), Microsoft, Team Cymru, and cyber police from Interpol, Germany , Holland, Romania and independent writers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ad/683/a44/4ad683a44d4c70c8be33ad337088f7e1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Hall with participants.</i>  <i>Many, by the way, tweetted: look for the hash tag # SAS2012</i> <br><br>  This is the fourth time we invite external people to konfu, and this year, in addition to LK, Adobe, Barracuda and ThreatPost have become sponsors.  Interest in the conference is gradually growing and, I hope, in the foreseeable future we will grow to the level of Industry Events.  More precisely, to be honest, it has already grown - the level of reports and speakers spoke for itself. <br><br>  Now about the <s>meat</s> prezah.  For starters, I‚Äôll say that they were richer than AVARs and VBs presented recently in the disguised AVAR.  The speeches were really interesting and incendiary with real facts based on real surveys, incidents and operational activities, in the case of cyber policemen.  By the way, the speaker was mega-fun: each preza ended not only with stormy applause, but also with a shot of tequila, and each block with another shot.  The moderators of the long sessions were of course the hardest of all, however, we chose the most trained specialists, who hardened their will at previous summits: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/10a/4d6/8ec/10a4d68ecdd50934f91d48f8703975ef.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, in the appendage each keeper got a keg of tequila, drunk with a company of fresh acquaintances in the evening.  On the second day, when we got enough kegs of tequila and were able to put a part on the tables in front of the conference hall, coffee breaks became even more fun: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ec/a6d/2a3/5eca6d2a3be7d078a0a5625792a99807.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/626/93b/d9b/62693bd9bc540b684fe8f8890112553b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Coffeebreak - Kaspersky style;)</i> <br><br>  The most credible speeches were from the Dutch cyber police: about the <a href="http://www.securelist.com/ru/blog/40153/Gollandtsy_nagolovu_razbili_Bredolab">closure of Bredolaba</a> , the calculation and, most difficultly, the collection of evidence on the owner, the fight against child pornography in the network;  Interpol about the organization of <a href="http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Cybercrime/Cybercrime">cyberinterpol</a> (Finally! Casper has already <a href="http://www.interpol.int/Crime-areas/Cybercrime/Cybercrime">buzzed</a> <a href="http://e-kaspersky.livejournal.com/89191.html">all</a> this in <a href="http://www.securitylab.ru/news/212909.php">ten years</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a1/483/7c2/0a14837c2737d612f2b83121e3635346.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Peter Zinn (Dutch police) answer questions from the audience</i> <br><br>  An interesting research team of independent researchers from the United States, who managed to develop and conduct a test attack using the exploit for SCADA, which allows you to gain complete control over the entire control system of a particular prison: from the doors to the cameras, to the perimeter defense.  It turned out that the Internet in prison is like a gopher: you don‚Äôt see it, but it exists!  The plan of such institutions naturally does not imply any Ethernet, and even more no Wi-Fi.  However, time goes on, and in prisons, too, they pull wires, and they do connect critical computers to the web.  And what do the guards do at night for these computers, I will not tell you;).  The exploit, by the way, was written to SCADA from Siemens, but in principle nothing prevents this from being done for another supplier.  The whole research cost $ 2500 - agree, a frivolous amount for those who want to leave the prison "ahead of time". <br><br>  I also remember the reports about <a href="http://www.securelist.com/en/blog/208193370/The_Chupa_Cabra_malware_attacks_on_payment_devices">Malvara attacking POS-terminals</a> (those that are in each store), the treatment of legal sites (webmasters only in 3% of cases respond to the messages that they have an infected site), <a href="http://www.securelist.com/ru/find%3Fwords%3Dduqu%26searchtype%3D">‚Äúthe whole truth about Duqu‚Äù</a> , the <a href="http://barracudalabs.com/blog_4.html">identification of fake Facebook accounts</a> , analysis of fresh APT, about the <a href="http://www.darkreading.com/vulnerability-management/167901026/security/application-security/232600179/adobe-calls-for-defensive-approach-in-security-research.html">fight against exploits in Adobe</a> and Malware by mail (in the literal sense of the word, that is, transmitted by Russian Post :). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/87f/6b0/31c/87f6b031c1e7c944e3c3f3253db74750.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Brad Arkin from Adobe about bugs (apparently, rather big)</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efe/94c/83a/efe94c83a620c14f79f7df7ab34b1f1f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Levy from team Cymru is broadcasting a 60 Gbit / s DDoS attack analysis</i> <br><br>  Those who work well, also rely and have a good rest.  The consolidation of new acquaintances and the team spirit of the fighters against viruses, Trojans and their authors took place in the setting of the wild jungles and the Mayan pyramids on the third day.  At the general council they decided not to sacrifice anyone ... well, almost;).  Suddenly, it turned out that different types of woodpeckers work in the company: flying, running, and even woodpecker: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/44e/609/70e/44e60970e03c7b23600af2a02e4fee9f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>Although some representatives even in the jungle talked about work</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1c8/957/c1a/1c8957c1a7eade194b4123ca43f93ca7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  SAS has grown into a useful, interesting, and not unimportant, very positive event.  Yes, disputes of privacy fighters, experts and cyber police officers were sometimes very hot, but a great atmosphere (well, barrels with fiery water) helped to defuse the situation and find a common language, as well as truth.  The main message of the conference: ‚ÄúLet's take the bull by the horns‚Äù - I mean, all the interesting stories should be supported by the case: Malvar Detective, treatment sites and catching criminals.  Looking forward to next year! <br><br>  <b>Summit participant: senior virus analyst at Kaspersky Lab Yuri Namestnikov</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137892/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137892/</a></p>
