Only in 2018, one of them showed a profit.  This pioneer was Spotify.  In the Swedish company, however, do not celebrate the triumph.  We delve into how Spotify made a profit, why it reacted to its achievement with coolness and what prevents streaming services from getting a plus. <br><br> <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/433648/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5c/ud/tm/5cudtmwjz74n6jnrx8_andjjpi0.jpeg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>Photo of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/sunil_soundarapandian/32986364685/">Sunil Soundarapandian</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  Why streaming platforms are not profitable </h2><br>  Despite popularity among users, streaming platforms are losing money.

      Some companies do not meet the ends because of the imperfection of monetization models.  SoundCloud has <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5640.html">not made a</a> profit for the past ten years.  At first, the startup tried to follow the path of Spotify and sell subscriptions, but did not gain a sufficient subscriber base and almost went bankrupt.  Now SoundCloud is trying to make money on services for musicians.  However, so far this has not brought the company a plus. <br><br>  Pandora has a similar situation.  Until 2017, only ‚Äúradio stations‚Äù were available in the service according to genres or the style of individual performers, and the listener could not play specific songs and albums at will, which <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/29/media/pandora-internet-radio-future/index.html">led to an outflow of the audience</a> .  Recently, the platform introduced the ability to listen to music of their choice, but the moment was lost.  User activity in Pandora <a href="https://variety.com/2018/digital/news/pandora-q1-2018-earnings-1202797588/">continues</a> to decline, and most of them do not pay for a subscription. <br><br>  Another reason for the lack of profit - the cost of payments to music labels.  Apple Music and Spotify have encountered it: the second <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/03/05/spotifys-truly-disruptive-potential.aspx">spends</a> on royalties and does <b>about 80% of the income</b> . <br><br>  For Apple Music, short-run profit is less important.  The main task of the product is to attract users to the Apple ecosystem.  However, with Spotify, the issue of earnings is acute. <br><br>  The Swedish company worked at a loss from the very start: it lost up to <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/spotify-ipo-comes-amid-questions-over-streaming-services-profits/">one and a half billion</a> dollars a year.  It would seem that the first profit in the history of the service should have inspired the leadership of Spotify, but not everything is so simple. <br><br><h2>  How Spotify Profits </h2><br><blockquote>  According to the financial <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2018/q3/Shareholder-Letter-Q3-2018.pdf">report</a> for the third quarter of 2018, Spotify really managed to get a plus.  The organization announced a net profit of ‚Ç¨ 43 million. Although this amount is only 3.2% of Spotify's turnover, financial results for the third quarter were better than the first two: since the beginning of 2018, the company has lost $ 563 million. <br><br>  For 2017, its loss resulted in ‚Ç¨ 1.24 billion. </blockquote><br>  The reason for the unexpected profitability "in the moment" is a reduction in costs.  Compared to the previous quarter, Spotify spent less money on developing new features and marketing.  Also, according to company CEO Daniel Ek (Daniel Ek), costs <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-just-turned-the-first-net-profit-in-its-history-and-its-not-particularly-happy-about-it/">have decreased</a> due to a reduction in the number of employees. <br><br>  In addition, there are other prerequisites for potential growth.  For example, getting a share in Tencent Music (China).  In 2017, these two companies exchanged minority stakes of their shares, as a result, Spotify now has 9.1% Tencent Music, and the latter has a 7.5% share in Spotify.  In the third quarter of 2018, the Chinese organization submitted an application for an IPO in the United States.  Prior to that, she reassessed her value, which <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/spotify-is-profitable-for-once-hits-87-million-subscribers-keeping-it-worlds-biggest-streaming-music-service/">led</a> to an increase in the share price of Spotify. <br><br><h2>  Why is the company dissatisfied with the financial situation </h2><br>  Spotify does not express enthusiasm for these financial indicators.  We are talking only about the third quarter, so there‚Äôs no way to talk about a plus for the year. <br><br><blockquote>  In fact, the Swedish company <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2018/11/12/why-wall-street-tuned-out-spotifys-surprising-prof.aspx">continues</a> to lose money.  This negatively <a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/11/22/goldman-sachs-spotify-price-objective/">affected</a> the attitude of investors to its securities: several large financial institutions, such as Goldman Sachs, lowered the <a href="https://www.conomy.ru/zachem-nuzhna-celevaja-spravedlivaja-cena/">target price</a> of Spotify shares. </blockquote><br>  It is expected that following the results of the IV quarter of 2018, the company will again go into negative.  Including because it <a href="https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/spotify-just-turned-the-first-net-profit-in-its-history-and-its-not-particularly-happy-about-it/">invests</a> in the development of new functionality.  According to Spotify CFO Barry McCarthy (Barry McCarthy), this is her top priority. <br><br>  The financial situation of the Swedish music giant threatens to deteriorate in the long term.  The company expects a fall in average revenue per user (ARPU) due to growing popularity in the markets of Latin America and Southeast Asia (see page 3 of its <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/540910603/files/doc_financials/quarterly/2018/q3/Shareholder-Letter-Q3-2018.pdf">report</a> ).  There are popular cheap rates for students and family subscriptions to the service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kj/hq/sp/kjhqspwydzaunwwzwde_oyyxquk.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dordrecht-holland/33870840882/">Paul van de Velde</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC BY</a> photo</i></font> <br><br><h2>  What Spotify will do </h2><br>  In the near future, the company hopes to start earning more from developing its own product.  Possible points of growth are advertising and podcasts. <br><br>  Advertisers Spotify <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4218254-can-programmatic-ads-save-spotify">plans</a> to use Ad Studio's automatic ad placement technology, which is designed to provide more effective advertising targeting.  The company expects this to increase the demand for advertising. <br><br>  Podcasts are interesting to streaming service by <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pandora-spotify-look-to-podcasts-to-boost-profits-2018-11-18">increasing the</a> time spent by users in the application, and hence the number of advertisements per listener.  Moreover, releasing podcasts is cheaper than buying license rights to use music.  While Spotify users spend on this format only 1% of the total time in the service, but the company plans to increase this figure. <br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  Multi-million subscriber armies <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/05/03/spotify-earnings/">do not help</a> streaming services to be a plus in the short term: companies spend too much money on royalties. <br><br><blockquote>  The financial situation of Spotify and Apple Music may deteriorate even more with the introduction of new laws in favor of performers.  In the US, they recently adopted the <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/428724/">Music Modernization Act</a> , which will oblige streaming platforms to pay more to musicians.  Although Spotify and Pandora <a href="http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/spotify-formally-backs-music-modernization-act/">supported</a> the law, it is not clear how it will affect the welfare of companies. </blockquote><br>  A way out of this situation for services can be podcasts.  Today, they are already <a href="https://habr.com/company/audiomania/blog/430894/">attracting</a> large advertisers, such as Chanel and BMW, and are bringing more and more money to the authors.  In addition to Spotify, pandcasts are being developed by Pandora: the company has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18129052/pandora-podcast-genome-project-personalized-recommendations">developed a</a> new recommendation algorithm for audio shows. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Microposts about sound are in our Telegram channel:</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/665">New Year's sale in Audiomania is still open</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/669">Our Telegram Podcast - Discussing Home Audio Systems</a></i> <i><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xq/5o/_r/xq5o_rmc8w8juvbckkxdgn5adaw.png"></i>  <i><a href="https://t.me/audiomaniaRU/670">Brand history: talking about Sennheiser</a></i> <i><br><br></i> <hr> <i><br></i>  <i>We have opened a <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/hot_price/">New Year sale</a> with discounts up to 75%.</i>  <i>The action involves a variety of categories: from portable to professional audio.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/433648/">https://habr.com/ru/post/433648/</a></p>
