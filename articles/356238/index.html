      Editorial opinion on the absurdity of the requirements: <br><blockquote>  Has a similar requirement been received in CrimeaSpas to remove material, it has not yet been possible to find out.  And we ought to demand.  Then no one will know who, from what and how much was saved in the Crimea.  After all, the concealment of information, and not concern for reducing the mortality rate of the Russian population, is the goal of prohibitions on the use of words. <br><br>  If the officials really cared about saving our lives, then in Sevastopol in the evenings there would be more than one pediatrician for 500 thousand people.  Then the children's hospital would have the necessary equipment, and the children who arrived by ambulance would not wait for the doctor for hours.  Then, in pharmacies for beneficiaries, there would be insulin and painkillers for seriously ill people who are increasingly committing unbearable agony [Roskomnadzor].  Then the state would be engaged in the prevention of the reasons for the desire of its citizens to accomplish [Roskomnadzor], - poverty, injustice, lack of life prospects, - and not concealment of already accomplished facts.  What can I say, then much would be different in the country.  But while we prefer with one hand to ban the name of the action, and the other - to push them.  And this is absurd. </blockquote><br>  The editors pro-Rosrolnadzor using the insert <b>[Roskomnadzor]</b> instead of the trigger word <i>which cannot be mentioned</i> . <br><br><blockquote>  On the morning of November 5, the rescue service received a message that an unknown woman threatened to commit <b>[Roskomnadzor]</b> on top of the White Rock near Belogorsk.  The help of rescuers in evacuation is required, the Emergencies Ministry reported.  <i>The word supervised word was used on the organization's website, from where we actually took this heading.</i> <br><br>  Upon arrival, rescuers found that a 45-year-old resident of Belogorsk was sitting on the edge of a cliff, not letting anyone near her and was actually threatening to commit <b>[Roskomnadzor]</b> . <br><br>  According to rescuers, the situation was complicated by the fact that the victim did not let anyone near her and threatened to jump.  To save a woman from <b>[Roskomnadzor]</b> , it was necessary to act quickly, but at the same time with extreme caution, so as not to provoke a potential <b>[Roskomnadzor]</b> .  The woman was very nervous and could jump at any moment. <br><br>  Together with a woman, negotiations were held, after some time she agreed to take the phone from the rescuers to call relatives.  When the woman reached for the phone and was distracted by it, the emergency officials took the moment to take it away from the edge of the cliff, and then transferred it to the ambulance staff.  At the moment, the life of a woman is not in danger. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356238/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356238/</a></p>
