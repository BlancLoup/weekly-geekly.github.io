After analyzing the ‚ÄúWishlist‚Äù of users and problems of monitoring commercial vehicles, we took a step forward and implemented remote control of device settings, added analysis of the operation of additional onboard equipment and not only.  As usual, screenshots, a description of the work of the main mechanisms, and a couple of bonus buns for those who use mobile phones (PDAs) as wearable trackers. <br>  You are welcome to roll! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Disclaimer (instead of intro) </h4><br>  So that our <s>friends are</s> not told by competitors - the service was \ is \ will be free for the average user (who has hands and brain to set up the device himself), and who wants to see where his wife \ child \ service car is located.  All the <s>goons</s> take money for it - we do not.  Our service is developing faster than any paid one, and we are immensely happy about it. <br><br><h4>  Discrete sensors (about analog - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/105448/">read here</a> ) </h4><br>  Our service is becoming more and more users who use GPS monitoring of commercial vehicles - such as trucks, dump trucks, loaders.  All innovations and developments in this direction are made exclusively at the request of our customers and at the expense of the funds they <s>donate to</s> transfer to the development of the program. <br>  For them it is important not only to know where and when the transport was located, but it is also important to have information about its work.  Now this possibility is on our service.  Namely: tracking of important events with the help of information processing from discrete sensors.  Those.  the user assigns arbitrary variables to the sensor values ‚Äã‚Äã(sensor1 = door \ body \ ignition, sensor value: 0-closed, 1-open).  Also, the user can assign a color change to the left column with cars (only for usability, I quickly looked and I can see who works and who doesn't).

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a217794b/7e9eaab2/78e8fdc9/05f06f7b.jpg"><br><br>  On the screen you can see the jackdaw - Voice alarm, Bender for the alert will be screwed the other day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/9b053a80/d93b1c31/73ed86ec/178a5842.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Alarm button </h4><br>  Well, it's hard to add something here, it was not there before - now it has been implemented.  Everything is simple - there is a tracker, there is an alarm button (or exit from the alarm system, bolted as an alarm button), when a sensor is pressed or triggered, the image is centered on the object, it produces a <s>lousy</s> beep until the event is processed.  Works on wearable GPS trackers, as well as on car trackers with discrete outputs.  Variations on the alarm button you can think of any, it is desirable to use the dispatcher, who would monitor the objects and respond immediately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/180a1652/e4b6ea27/2d77d91e/cefde4f4.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Star of David Filter </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/715a73fa/ecaee553/9b0aee32/9a30c000.jpg" align="left">  There is such a phenomenon when when parking vehicles because of the curves of Chinese hands that collected GPS antennas (options are also possible with the installers' hands or simply because of the dense building in large cities), during the night / parking there is an independent release of coordinates, and the system counts them as mileage, which sometimes can be up to 20 km (or even more).  You can get rid of it in several ways.  The easiest -program filter, but it will lead to errors in traffic jams, or when the vehicle is moving slowly.  The second method (the <s>most correct</s> , implemented by us) is to connect the ignition as an event for which the motion will be processed, i.e.  key turned \ inserted - we consider the movement.  You can develop this option indefinitely - you can connect the cheapest accelerometer for motion processing, included dimensions, lowered handbrake, etc. <br><br><h4>  Remote control of devices via GPRS channel </h4><br>  The management of modern GPS trackers is usually reduced to SMS commands, CSD (archaism), and GPRS commands.  When spinning one or two GPS trackers on the login, configuring sms is not a problem, and it takes no more than a couple of minutes, but when you manage a large fleet and, say, there is a need to change the coordinate sending intervals over the whole park - you can‚Äôt do without GPRS.  To do this, we made the most simple and versatile chat mechanism with the device.  Those.  You send configuration commands to a device or a group of devices (a list of commands, a template or hands) - they respond via GPRS, to receive a command, sending the execution status.  Total - we save time, money, we get the results as quickly as possible.  At the moment, the mechanism is debugged and works with several manufacturers (for whom this is possible, as it turned out there are not so many of them).  This mechanism can also implement a direct tunnel with a device - for polling, for example, ground stations, sensors, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/808e4332/7fce6201/40b0313c/fc7ffcce.jpg"><br><br><h4>  GPS trackers </h4><br>  At the moment we support all popular software trackers.  FAQ is already registered by our users on the <a href="http://forum.gps-tracker.com.ua/">forum</a> (all low bow).  For <a href="http://forum.gps-tracker.com.ua/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D13">Android</a> , our application (already presented on Habr√©), for WinMob there is a choice: <a href="http://forum.gps-tracker.com.ua/viewtopic.php%3Fid%3D56">our software</a> (the <a href="http://tarakan.habrahabr.ru/">author</a> has already been mentioned) or Franson GPS Gate, for Symbian - Aspicore (the price bites, but Google knows where to find), for J2ME - <a href="http://mapnav.spb.ru/">St. Petersburg guys</a> .  In the next month there will be a mobile version of the service itself for viewing the location of objects, small reports, viewing the status of sensors on any phone with a browser. <br>  The protocols of all wearable GPS trackers, which are currently known and popular in the CIS ( <s>100,500 variations of the Chinese TK-102</s> ) are connected and disassembled, and we continue to connect the devices of our manufacturers subject to the provision of protocols. <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  Plans, as usual, a lot.  We are implementing a step by step quality product that will be useful to many. <br><br>  <i>Thanks for the support!</i> <br>  Your <a href="http://gps-tracker.com.ua/">GPS-tracker.com.ua</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114561/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114561/</a></p>
