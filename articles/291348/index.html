Facebook has noticed this and is now turning its Messenger into a full-fledged work tool through which online retailers connect with their customers.  The Business function is not yet available to residents of Russia, but on the whole it is already possible to discern what Facebook is going to do in the end. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7f/f11/f99/d7ff11f9940b4c56b7d2895263b55ba8.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  What was first a simple messaging among friends, eventually grew into a separate application, which, in turn, is rapidly becoming the main communication tool not only on a personal level, but also on a business level.

      Now there are 600 million Messenger users, new features appear every month - first curtsy towards XMPP, then stickers and the ability to make audio calls, then video calls, and just the other day, the ability to share geolocation and send the interlocutor a place on the map.  Messenger, now, perhaps, the very product of Facebook, to which all forces are thrown and which is developing at a super-fast pace. <br><br>  At the same time, the convenience of communication is improved: checkboxes and display of the interlocutor's avatar as an indicator of message delivery, integration with gadgets, the ability to send a friend an article or link directly from the chronicle, the ability to draw and edit images, share audio and video recordings, and more recently, gif -pictures. <br><br>  In Russia, according to our observations, Facebook is rarely used for correspondence, and Messenger as a main messenger even more so.  Nonetheless, it was him all over the world (especially after Facebook bought and practically froze WhatsApp) becomes the No. 1 communication tool.  And this is explained by the fact that today Messenger has a wide range of tools and, oddly enough, amazing reliability of message delivery, and instantaneous (after Skype, WhatsApp, Viber and Telegramm, it seems like a miracle).  It‚Äôs no joke if we have communication with Americans through Messenger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba8/9b0/6e7/ba89b06e7dc949219d1a47da769252f6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Unlike its competitors, Messenger is still turning into a tool for working communication - no, it‚Äôs not just group chats, although they are very convenient.  Here we mean Messenger Business, about which we have somehow <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/rocketcallback/blog/14352/">written</a> . <br><br>  If you look at what Facebook promises us, then it becomes obvious - Messenger is planned to be used as the main tool with which online stores, and all other companies, will communicate with their customers.  It would seem that a clear desire to scale - the same is done by everyone else.  Line in China, which began as a regular instant messenger, now allows you to order a taxi and book seats in the cinema.  Snapchat, too, has long grown out of messaging almost into a mobile social network, which is only its Discovery. <br><br>  But Messenger is special - he decided to bet on personalization, bringing it to painful perfection, when communication does not take place at seller-buyer level, but ‚ÄúJohn Greaves, manager of Everlane, Linda Scott, 33, Columbus, Ohio‚Äù.  Messenger is already working with two major online stores - Everlane and Zulily. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73d/7e2/940/73d7e294079a4d0b897219e1c1e6b070.png" alt="image"><br><br>  What does it mean?  We all know how important it is to get as much information about a client as possible.  Messenger, in fact, allows you to get all of your client‚Äôs Facebook information.  Yes, today there are services that allow you to find a client in social networks, but Messenger connects directly, and the client has a history of dialogue, and the company has a client account.  And if you consider that Facebook is a social network No. 1 not only in the USA, then it is obvious that practically all companies that are somehow present on the Internet will want to take advantage of this opportunity. <br><br>  Unfortunately, Russia is unlikely to be included in this list.  Firstly, Facebook is not so popular - well, the client will come, well, he will discuss, next time he will go into the account now in 3 months (if he comes at all).  The value of such a contact tends to zero.  Secondly, it is not known whether the Facebook API of the messenger will open and whether it will work for Russia at all (Graph Search, for example, lived in its original extended form for a little over a year, but never reached the Russian-speaking users).  But these are all pessimistic forecasts, we personally hope that Facebook will have a growing audience in Russia (11 million in May 2015, although it was 500,000 5 years ago), which will make it possible to take advantage of all the nishtyaks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/753/a58/7e3/753a587e36fc41498e8cdc1ae8ccf7e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Returning to the trend.  One Messenger, with all its 600 million users, does not, of course, set the trend.  Here, in addition to him, there is also a chat <a href="https://www.zopim.com/">Zopim</a> , a small startup that started with 5 people, and today is one of the most successful projects.  The guys have very emotional <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/zopim">videos</a> , by the way. <br><br>  Zopim is slightly simpler than Messenger, although it works on its technology.  Despite this, Zopim has the same valuable asset - personalization.  In the window, you can log in via social networks and start chatting.  What is interesting is that the client‚Äôs history is not saved anywhere, but the company‚Äôs yes, just like the social network account through which the client was authorized.  Tomorrow it will be possible to knock and say: ‚ÄúHi Joe!  You asked a week ago on the site if we have 22 inch wheels.  We then told you that no.  So, we are pleased to announce that they have now been delivered!  Do you still need them? ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d16/9de/e0c/d169dee0c66d44a0a65d7a8533174d46.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  No online consultant or chat today does not allow it.  Yes, you can save the source of the call, the client's phone number, his location, but his social network account, which for many has become the point of entry into the Internet, is almost impossible to obtain.  If you only ask him in the dialog box leave the link. <br><br>  We do not want to disclose all the cards, but we in <a href="http://rocketcallback.com/">Rocket Callback are</a> now also working on personalization.  Ideally, of course, make sure that the visitor knows which of the managers will now pick up the phone (brunette Konstantin, blonde Maria, brown-haired Julia - photos, naturally), and the managers knew that they were calling (well, or called) Yuri Samoilov, 26 years old from Ryazan.  And all on a voluntary basis and legally. <br><br>  The future is in the means of communication for an affordable price, a wide range of tools and settings, as well as personalization.  The first two we already have - the lowest price in Russia for a minute of conversation and the full setting of both the appearance and the window's obnoxiousness.  The third is implemented partially so far - you can put a photo of the manager.  We will try to finish to the ideal. <br><br>  Thank you for reading us! <br>  Subscribe to our <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/rocketcallback/">blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291348/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291348/</a></p>
