      I reluctantly opened Gmail and found a letter with a single link leading to the site <a href="http://ithappens.ru/">It happens</a> .  For those who do not know, this is the project of the creators of the bashorg, collecting various stories from the life of technical support, system administrators and other IT people close to them. <br><br>  The link opened a story that I read in one breath.  It was published in the fall of 2011, when we just launched the first version of our service.  Despite the fact that the rating of this story was not bad, for some reason we only heard about it now.  Apparently, due to the lack of links to our site. <br>  I liked the presentation style, and Ivideon just really needs a good author for a blog. <br>  I thought, why not publish this story here?  Suddenly, the author will be one of the users and we will be able to cooperate?  And if we can't, I still want to donate to the person who wrote our <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/microdigital-mdc-i4240/">camera with Ivideon cloud support</a> .  In the meantime, under the cut quote the story itself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  What I love </h4><br>  To be honest, I do not like red wine at all.  I can drink it, but I actually prefer other drinks.  On the shelf behind my books Alexandrescu and Straustrup there was old good tequila.  And in my hand was a glass of wine, and I looked at Christina. <br><br>  How damn cool when you have an analytical mind and you can calculate everything.  Even the fact that this beautiful girl will sit in your room across from you on the evening of the first date.  Or was it fate? <br><br>  A month before these events, I bought an iPad.  Not that I needed it - rather, a tribute to fashion and a desire to understand this gadget in order to be aware of the direction of development of modern technology.  In the end, I'm a programmer, and this device is very popular. <br><br>  Like many, I started with Angry Birds.  Then there were strange applications that did nothing, but looked very beautiful.  And after that I read about the Ivideon program.  Free video surveillance via the Internet: you put on the computer a lightweight software and watch your webcam on the iPad.  It was nothing to me, but once free ... From time to time I looked through my camera, sometimes - even just lying on the couch in the next room.  It is like buying the first computer.  Familiar feeling?  You sit and drive with your mouse on the desktop.  It seems that nothing is needed, but I don‚Äôt want to get away from this mouse. <br><br>  Christina was very good.  Tall, slim.  Like "McDonald's" is what I love.  Something reminiscent of Nancy from the series Weeds.  Smart.  This is some elusive feeling that you communicate with an interesting person and want to know him better.  I realized this before I went on a date in a cafe.  I sincerely wanted to invite her to my place and show my collection of stamps, so I prepared in advance. <br><br>  We are sitting in a cafe.  Latte and cappuccino are drunk, cakes are eaten.  The bill is already carried.  I can't help thinking that I want her to look at my marks.  Therefore, I use the trick that I have prepared for it. <br><br>  When you invite a girl to visit, she may want it, but she is afraid of an unfamiliar place, so she refuses.  I take out the iPad and open my camera. <br><br>  The first thing she saw was a table in my room.  Glass.  Near the bed.  A bottle of wine, two glasses.  They reflected the flame of candles that burned on the table (I neglected the fire safety technique, I confess).  True, the room left the lights on: my webcam shows poorly in the dark.  Vase, rose.  She kissed me, as if at once she understood what it was for her. <br><br>  The account was brought, and we watched the saved records.  As I am a few hours goodbye, I wear around the room in my underpants and tidying up the unwashed plates, bottles, and everything that is usually found in the bachelor's apartment.  My house was no longer an unfamiliar place for her, and we went to me.  I didn't even have to ask her about it.  This is despite the fact that I did not have a cool carpet on the wall. <br><br>  And in the morning I was very sorry that my camera does not see in the dark.  Not that I like that ... But no, what am I talking about? <br><br>  The original was taken <a href="http://ithappens.ru/story/7891">from here</a> . <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> After the publication of this topic, we were written using a feedback form by several users, and is it possible to become our author, even if they did not write this story?  Of course you can.  True, I would like to, in addition to the desire to become our author, you have already written other interesting technical or not so articles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149359/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149359/</a></p>
