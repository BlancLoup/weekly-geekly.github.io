  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Return of Geektimes to Habr</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This is true, and it has already happened.  Hiktimes returned to Habr. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nj/yn/dx/njyndxfb-429b4rcv45rhxrztg4.gif" alt="image"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In a recent <a href="https://habr.com/company/tm/blog/93946/">publication,</a> we announced the transfer of Habra to the domain habr.com and told about the upcoming internationalization of the resource.  After 24 hours, this publication <a href="https://habr.com/top/yearly/">has become the best for the year</a> , and we have never received so many comments, letters of support and offers of cooperation.  It became clear that the audience supports our chosen motion vector;  it's time to tell you what will happen next. <br><br>  From the moment of its creation, Habr was an extensive resource that, in addition to its basic value ‚Äî content placement ‚Äî also offered other possibilities.  These are job search, question and answer service, calendar of events.  Habr grew, internal sections grew together with it. 
      <br>

      Over time, it became clear that if the subdivisions were divided into a separate project and given independence, having untied the Habr system, which was complex from the outside world, they could get a new breath.  So it happened.  The section with vacancies after several moves donkey on <a href="http://moikrug.ru/">My circle,</a> user questions - on the <a href="http://toster.ru/">Toaster</a> .  Then we launched a separate project - <a href="http://freelansim.ru/">Freelance</a> , but this is a separate story. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c_/22/3h/c_223hk0czjdybrphrjs7lfy8yo.png"><br>  <i><font color="#999999">What Habr looked like 10 years ago, in the lower right corner is the larva of My Circle.</font></i> <br><br>  Overall, the separation helped.  The toaster is now alive and vigorous, growing well in all respects.  My circle helps to find a job for more and more people, knows even more about <a href="https://moikrug.ru/salaries">salaries in the market</a> , and very soon will show how employees evaluate their experience in the companies where they worked.  Freelance is also updated and will soon restart, become more mature and offer a long-awaited deal without risk. <br><br>  Hiktayms also stood out from Habr and over the past since 2014, the time has been formed into an independent community.  This division had several motivations. <br><br>  First, we wanted to carry content to a separate project, which can be called ‚Äúentertaining‚Äù, or expanding the horizons, so that the user could also follow the current news agenda.  Secondly, we wanted only professional content to remain on Habr√©, practically useful, explaining and explaining, carrying value for IT specialists.  That Habr was not perceived as an entertainment project and did not treat it accordingly.  Such perceptions often created all sorts of problems, including with Roskomnadzor, which, at the request of the FSB, entered our Russian company LLC, Habr, into the register of information distributors according to <a href="https://rg.ru/2014/05/07/informtech-dok.html">97-FZ</a> . <br><br>  We have long thought what to do with Hiktaimes, which did not quite fit into our plan to focus on one brand and grow a global multiservice project - Habr, focused only on IT-specialists and providing a wide range of services.  We considered the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãallocating Hicktays into a separate company in order to leave the project independent, so that it would be on its own, as an independent player in the local market, but we saw difficulties with management.  And even after the <a href="https://habr.com/company/tm/blog/357978/">announcement</a> of the transfer of part of the hubs from Hiktaymes to Habr and comments, we felt that the time had come to do what intuition and user feedback suggests.  We return Hiktimes back to Habr, before starting a large return of all previously allocated projects back to Habr. <br><br>  In addition to the joy of a large part of users, such an association will have quite a few consequences, which can also be regarded as a fair wind: <br><br>  - Increase the speed of development and testing; <br>  - Simplify administration; <br>  - Simplify workflow; <br>  - Users and companies will no longer be torn between projects; <br>  - There will be less unnecessary movements with RSS feeds and subscriptions; <br>  - Mobile application will lose weight, update and become more understandable and integral; <br>  - We do not have to write two publications with the results at the end of the year; <br>  - It is easy to get many more points, but more on that in future announcements. <br><br>  A few nuances about the transfer: <br><br>  - While all hubs returning from emigration to Hicktimes will be in a separate stream - <a href="https://habr.com/flows/geektimes/">Hicktimes</a> ; <br>  - Earlier, profile hubs on hubs will remain profile on Habr√©, but changes will follow in the future; <br>  - If on two projects you had accounts with different rights, then Habr√© will have the highest rights.  For example, if you had <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/registration/">Read &amp; Comment</a> authority on Habr√©, and Hiktimes had a <a href="https://habr.com/info/help/registration/">full</a> account, then after gluing, the Habr√© account will become full (if it is not under sanctions for breaking the rules of the community, otherwise it will remain readonly until the expiration date sanctions); <br>  - If on two projects you had a different karma, after the transfer it will have the greatest of values; <br>  - If your company had two blogs, then the validity periods are summarized. <br><br>  Okay, you thought, it all looks like a good plan, but why aren't you afraid of the difficulties you wanted to avoid by sharing projects?  After all, now everything comes back to Habr. <br><br>  First, the merging of projects under the wing of Habr is now possible, because we have learned how to work with a multi-level system of accounts with different user rights.  Not only karma and rating regulate the capabilities of the user, but also the types of accounts.  This system is somewhat similar to the system of obtaining citizenship in a particular country.  We are able to distinguish between user rights, which gives us flexibility in making decisions. <br><br>  Secondly, we focused on internationalization and plan to make multilingual not only Habr, but also other projects that will become part of the same brand.  My circle will move to career.habr.com, the toaster will be located on qa.habr.com, and freelance on deals.habr.com.  Developing one project is easier than several.  We understood this through blood, sweat and tears. <br><br>  And thirdly, combining will allow us to refresh the stack of technologies and approaches used in projects and the development of technologies.  This is also one of the motivations of the union.  We have long wanted to rewrite many things, but for various reasons it was impossible to do what we would like. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  This summer there will be a lot of releases and announcements.  Sit back, stock up on popcorn, we are starting a new big story.  Very soon we will offer to test the new mobile version of Habr, and later we will show and tell in more detail how internationalization will work.  We have already translated the interfaces and documentation, but there is still a lot of work to do before the feature becomes available for <a href="https://habr.com/company/tm/blog/347068/">beta testing</a> . <br><br>  And this Saturday, Habra turned 12 years old - on May 26, 2006, the first user of <a href="https://habr.com/users/habrahabr/" class="user_link">habrahabr</a> was registered.  For any Internet project, 12 years of life is a pretty solid age (‚ÄúYes, this is more than a third of my life!‚Äù - <i>Burum comment</i> ), but Habr is still young and full of energy, so all the fun lies ahead. <br><br>  Stay tuned for updates, they will follow soon. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Technical work on the union (transfer of publications, recalculation of all indicators) began yesterday afternoon and will end today in the evening.</b>  <b>Please have patience.</b> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93947/</a></p>
