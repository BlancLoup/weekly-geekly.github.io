I want to tell you one story, the story of our project. <br><br>  It all started back in the 2005th year, in one of the local portals (I must say that I live in the city of Barnaul, Altai Territory), then I indulged in photoshop and exhibited my processed photos in the gallery of this portal.  There were a lot of such spoilers, with different levels, with different successes, we took photos and processed them.  There was also a forum on that portal, in one of the sections of which people posted their poems, in fact, what I also did. <br><br>  It was all so scattered, disorganized and crumpled, that individual users constantly had thoughts and suggestions to make a separate resource for these creative efforts.  What we actually do with my friend.  The project was ready on March 2, 2006, and its main goal was to unite the creative personalities of the city and provide a platform for discussion and communication.  There were four sections: photos, graphics, poems and prose.  Sections were replenished by user forces and supervised by moderators who added or removed new works.  The site was quite popular in the city, mainly due to the fact that due to the expensive global Internet, people sat on local resources.

      With the advent of cheap Internet, people gradually began to crawl away from the site.  Attendance fell sharply and we decided to take a risky step: change the engine, design, slightly change the concept and most importantly - go out into a big and terrible runet, the blessing is what it is. <br><br>  On March 2, 2010, <a href="http://creobox.ru/">creobox.ru was</a> opened on a separate domain.  Now, among other things, we have the opportunity to add music and write posts to the alablogging forum, we wound up a lot of agax (I‚Äôll make a reservation, the programmer is not professional, so the code is very far from ideal), but most importantly, we introduced a collective moderation system.  Moderators was not one / two, as it was before;  Now each registered and active user is a moderator.  We have already experienced such a system on our other resource and it showed itself from the best side, if someone becomes interested, I will tell about its essence in the comments.  We saved the accumulated base of creativity, and all works can be viewed and read right now. <br><br>  We do not have great illusions about the novelty of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating creative catalogs, but we are sure that since it was done here, no one has done it yet.  It remains only to invite those interested in registering, and skeptics and lovers to criticize comments. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87841/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87841/</a></p>
