  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How does it feel to write articles</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most recently, I published my first article on Habrahabr, thereby changing my status from <i>silence</i> to <i>habron</i> .  For me personally, the decision to <i>write</i> was not easy.  What pushed and what it cost, I will tell in this article, while everything is fresh in my memory.  Who cares, welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Who is this article for? </h2><br>  First of all, this is an article for those readers who have something to tell our community, but who in no way can take the first step.  I will try to tell you briefly what I have experienced, what I received and how to answer the question - ‚Äú <i>Is it not for nothing that</i> '?  And each of you, the silent people, will decide for himself whether it is worth it or not.  If there are dozens of articles on your list, here you can just remember the feelings about your first ... <br><br><h2>  Fears and uncertainties </h2><br>  I have long been tormented by doubts about writing or not.  Therefore, one day I asked myself: <i>What, in fact, hinders</i> ?  I am old enough to answer this question honestly and self-critically.  It turned out - fear of the <i>public</i> , on the one hand, and uncertainty, and whether it is necessary for someone else - on the other.  I am ashamed to confess, but it took me 3 years to overcome these 2 states.  It‚Äôs not that I thought every day during this time, it‚Äôs just that much time has passed since that first thought.  And I'm glad I could overcome myself.  It is hard to give relevant advice to the doubters, except how - take the first step.  I dare to suggest that some authors do not see the problem at all in the foregoing, if you think about it, write an article ‚Äî it‚Äôs also a feat.  But believe me, this is all too individual and for some people to get out of the comfort zone and take a little risk - that is still a problem. <br><br><h2>  With sweat and blood </h2><br>  Of course, article article strife.  There are very simple ones, like this one, and there are those according to which you can safely write a dissertation, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/321292/">an example here</a> .  But one thing is certain: the article is work.  From my experience it was like this - I wrote one in 4 hours about the interview at the meeting.  And the other, small, was born, thanks to 2 years of development, during which 2 Talmuds 600 pages each were read, some chapters of which were re-read 20 times, more than 3 projects were studied on the githaba, over 1000 java classes were written.  Of course, all this was done not for the sake of the article, but they are born thanks to such work.  Yes, the first step is not easy, but if you have something to say, tell me.  At a minimum, the server logs will not forget you :)

    <h2>  Emotions and special condition </h2><br>  Emotions are what you get, regardless of whether you want it or not.  And these are not just emotions.  I have never experienced such a thing: on the one hand, a basin over my head with a fetid liquid still splashes, tipping over you sometimes after a 'good' comment and immediately filling up again, waiting for my moment.  On the other hand, these are the hormones of joy that start to stand out quickly when the stars and huskies grow and you realize that your work has come to your taste.  So, the state in which you are after the first article is a thermonuclear mixture of positive and negative that gets on you at the same time.  I am not a fan of such a pun of emotions, but I know for sure that many of these states are simply necessary, like air.  It is useful for someone to shake things off and look at some things with different eyes.  But in all cases, one must be psychologically prepared for a completely unexpected development of events. <br><br><h2>  Comments </h2><br>  After the written article, you will find an unpredictable journey into the minds of readers.  And this journey begins after the first comment.  But get ready, in them you will find everything in general - on the topic and in offtopic, praise and blasphemy, anger and joy, and much more.  But I would like to dwell on specific comments from attentive readers and very smart people.  It turns out this, with the question that in order to answer it, you have to learn more than you have learned in the last 3 months, for ooooochen short lines.  You start to respect yourself, that you could understand and answer so quickly, but if you make a mistake, polite people will indicate this to you.  To be honest, you can write more than one article about comments and their informative part, just let your imagination run wild. <br><br><h2>  They are somewhere near </h2><br>  They are the people with whom you work every day, who have a huge background, but who for unknown reasons are silent.  They have something to say, but they are silent.  What is wrong?  For example, I know one who could tell how he managed to write a transformer and translator of the code base of an application written in Java (UI in Swing, logic in LISP) into an application under the Browser (HTML5, CSS and JavaScript).  The total source of more than 1,000,000 lines of code!  Another one has a life story of what he got during an interview in 2002 with a task - to write a mini DBMS for a JAVA application.  And you know what?  This mini DBMS has been running for 15 years now.  There is also one that is silent about the modifications in Proguard for obfuscation of JavaScript, working under Rhino / Nashorn.  And many others. <br><br><h2>  Wishes </h2><br>  Try it once.  Take a quill, ink and white parchment.  Write what you have long wanted to share.  And get in return thanks, a new circle of people, new knowledge, a bouquet of emotions and self-esteem. <br><br>  Good luck and new articles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/323402/">https://habr.com/ru/post/323402/</a></p>
