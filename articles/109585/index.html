  <section class="page js-page"><h1>When will they die? ..</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This story began yesterday, when, interested in the history of speech and music, I found in the wonderful book by Joseph Jordania ‚ÄúWho asked the first question?‚Äù A reference to the book ‚ÄúSinging Neanderthals‚Äù by Professor Stephen Miethen.  Judging by the quoted passages, this book is of great interest to me, since, apparently, Myten is the first who began to seriously consider the emergence of music as a process that has direct evolutionary significance and happened before the appearance of speech.  So, I decided to read this book. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Internet kindly offered to buy for some 19 bucks <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Singing-Neanderthals-Origins-Music-Language/dp/0674025598/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1291793783%26sr%3D8-1">on Amazon</a> .  Freebie, pliz.

      No, I would love to put 20 bucks - but a) why do I need a paper book?  b) I need it now, and not in February (and this is if our valiant post handles the whole book delivery quest at all). <br><br>  ‚ÄúMaybe somewhere they are selling electronically?‚Äù I thought hopefully.  Horseradish.  Do not sell.  Bypass.  Indeed, how can one sell an electronic book of 2006 edition ?! <br>  There is, however, another book by Miten, 1998 - ‚ÄúCreativity in Human Evolution and Prehistory‚Äù.  Only <a href="http://www.booksamillion.com/product/Q1822403%3Fid%3D4917945070170">185 bucks</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúSo immediately Google opened its own store!‚Äù - I remembered.  There is anyway! <br>  Yeah, wait.  Twice.  The book and the truth is in guglobuksah.  In this form: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b0c97308/59d66f4b/a01905c0/23f00b39.png"><br><br>  Buy offer.  All in the same Amazon and Barnes Noble. <br><br>  "Maybe even in Russia somewhere there, and maybe for nothing?" - I thought, seeing in the <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/shes/about/staff/s-j-mithen.aspx">list of publications</a> and Russian.  Right now.  In general, no one was holding, judging by <a href="http://yandex.ru/yandsearch%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%2B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%2B%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D1%258E%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%2B%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2586%25D1%258B">the search results</a> . <br><br>  Maybe there is on Ozone?  And the truth is!  The cheapest English-language paperback edition, and only for 1504 (one thousand five hundred and four) rubles ( <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3928814/">proof</a> )!  The expected date of transfer to the delivery service is December 29!  It is a pity that they did not specify which year. <br><br>  Your mother, this is an academic publication!  Harward University Press!  Not Joan Rolling what, not ‚ÄúTwilight.  Saga".  A serious scientific study, and, apparently, the first in its direction.  What kind of nonsense?  Who will die of hunger, if you sell this book in electronic form, I don‚Äôt say - to put in free access? <br><br>  That is, it turns out that there is nothing for some amateur enthusiasts (for example, me) to be interested in modern scientific literature.  We will manage. <br><br>  Dear copywriters.  Please die soon. <br><br>  <strong>UPD</strong> .  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/copyright/109585/">Addition</a> from VovixLDR <br><blockquote>  All surprised, and here is a copyright. <br><br>  The point is not that the copywriters do not want to distribute the book in electronic form, which will not bring them the Big Pins. <br><br>  The fact is that, under the threat of a court, they prevent this from being done by those who would really like to tackle the ‚Äúlong tail‚Äù of scientifically-yet-not-very-popular literature.  For example, I would not mind slightly rewarding those who scan a book published in the last century, a little-known to the general public and not for sale in the nearest offline book, and put it on the net.  But there are none, because publishers have all the rights, and publishers are like a dog in the manger. <br><br>  This is the real problem of copyright - not that someone asks for money in some markets, but that many markets simply do not exist due to copyright.  And this is a guarantee that once the desire of society to share information, this very copyright with its exclusive rights and bury. <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109585/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109585/</a></p>
