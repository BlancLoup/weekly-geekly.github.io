      But first a little intro. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>How do DLP / SLA 3D printers work?</b> <br><br>  Photopolymers are used as consumables for SLA printing.  Under the influence of light, these liquid substances become solid. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5b/05c/e56/f5b05ce56346481897a543804ee9ee71.jpg"></div><br><br>  There are two ways to start the photopolymerization reaction.  The first method is to use a laser to ‚Äúdraw‚Äù the layers of an object and is called stereolithography (SLA). <br><br>  The second way is to design the whole part of the object using a digital projector, exactly the same one that is used when watching movies.  This process is called digital light processing (DLP). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cc0/63e/7be/cc063e7be977460b8c8eb9d64fd40377.jpg"></div><br><br>  Each of these technologies has its own advantages and disadvantages. <br><br>  In our list, we are considering 3D printers that cost about $ 5,000 to 10,000, which means we have set aside expensive professional 3D printers from companies such as EnvisionTEC, DWS, Prodways, and others. <br><br>  In the lower limit of the price range, we did not include DIY SLA 3D printer sets or SLA 3D printers that come with external projectors in the list. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/formlabs-form-2.html">Formlabs Form 2</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/186/3fc/a9c/1863fca9c3714f4d95dd7d098c1083c9.jpg"></div><br><br>  In the wake of the success of the Form 1+ printer, the Formlabs team has set itself a bigger challenge.  After all, they single-handedly sold more SLA 3D printers than anyone else in the history of the industry.  The company has gone beyond the usual with Form 2, a new, easy-to-use SLA 3D printer with plug-and-play technology. <br><br>  Compared to its predecessor, the Form 2 working platform is much larger: 145 x 145 x 175 mm with a resolution between 25 and 200 microns. <br><br>  It works faster, plus there is a wireless connection.  However, the main innovation is the cartridge system, which has made the process of replacing materials faster and safer (cartridges also have an ‚Äúopen mode‚Äù that allows you to work with third-party materials).  Just keep in mind that containers for composites are considered consumables, and you will have to periodically replace them. <br><br>  Amazingly, the cost of Form 2 does not differ from the price of its predecessor, despite the fact that Form 1+ has dropped even more in price. <br><br>  Currently, <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/formlabs-form-2.html">Form 2‚Äôs</a> official waiting period is about 10 weeks, but in fact it has been increased by + 2-3 weeks due to the huge popularity of this 3d printer. <br><br>  <b>Recommended price in Russia:</b> ‚Ç¨ 5,500 <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/formlabs-form-2.html">Buy Formabs Form 2 SLA 3D Printer</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/dws-lab-xfab.html">DWSLab Xfab</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfb/4b9/812/dfb4b98128164768a72ce6b563efc8b6.jpg"></div><br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/dws-lab-xfab.html">Xfab</a> was first announced almost two years ago. <br><br>  Yes, it is not as affordable as Form 2. However, the price is completely offset by the high quality of SLA 3D printers from Digital Wax Systems.  A company from northern Italy boasts the highest level machines for the jewelry and dental industry, starting at ‚Ç¨ 10,000. <br><br>  The <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/dws-lab-xfab.html">Xfab</a> printer was released at a low price due to the company's desire to distribute this technology and make it as affordable as possible.  The dimensions of the cylindrical inverted Xfab print area are 180 mm in height and 180 mm in diameter.  10 high quality DWS materials are suitable for printing, including nano-ceramics, rubber-like, cast and transparent composites, all in convenient containers. <br><br>  Recommended price in Russia: about 8 000 ‚Ç¨ <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/dws-lab-xfab.html">Buy SLA 3D Printer DWSLab Xfab</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/autodesk-ember.html">Autodesk ember</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1af/7f6/68c/1af7f668cce74fa6afd87ff75abf3b74.jpg"></div><br><br>  The <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/autodesk-ember.html">Ember</a> project is considered the first step by Autodesk, a software company, in the hardware market. <br><br>  And although the decision to create and sell a publicly available DLP 3D printer did not excite major DLP manufacturers, this project showed how important 3D printing is for market leaders in software. <br><br>  Ember effectively leverages the entire ecosystem for online connected and multi-item 3D printing, as well as a foundation called Spark, which funds all 3D printing companies that contribute to what Autodesk calls the ‚Äúfuture of making things‚Äù (‚Äúthe future of things ‚Äù).  HP and 3D Hubs take part in the fund, as well as exciting projects like Carbon3D and Voxel8. <br><br>  Recommended price in Russia: about $ 9000 <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/autodesk-ember.html">Buy Autodesk Ember DLP 3D Printer</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/formlabs-form-1-plus.html">Formlabs Form 1+</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/186/3fc/a9c/1863fca9c3714f4d95dd7d098c1083c9.jpg"></div><br><br>  Form1 +, created by alumni of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is probably the coolest desktop SLA 3D printer in terms of external parameters.  You probably noticed him in a recent film from the studio Marvel "The Ant-Man." <br><br>  The previous Form 1 was the first low-cost SLA 3D printer to hit the market in 2012.  The subsequent modification, Form 1+, was released in 2014 and today remains the best-selling 3D printer in its class. <br><br>  With the discontinuation of Form 1 production, <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/formlabs-form-1-plus.html">Form 1+</a> became the real standard of Formlabs printers.  Both printers have stereolithographic technology, and to date, no company has been able to offer a comparable product at a similar price.  The printer does not depend on the projector (laser is used instead), which, in turn, means image resolution independence and the ability to create larger objects with high resolution (up to 125 x 125 x 165 mm). <br><br>  Sold along with four different types of composite materials, including cast and new Tough Resin. <br><br>  There are no queues for this printer and you can get it pretty quickly. <br><br>  By the way, in detail, we analyzed his predecessor in his review on this page. <br><br>  Recommended price in Russia: 4 500 ‚Ç¨ <br><br>  <a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/formlabs-form-1-plus.html">Buy Formabs Form 1+ SLA 3D Printer</a> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://top3dshop.ru/kupit-3d-printer/xyzprinting-nobel-1.html">XYZ Printing Nobel 1.0</a></b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af4/085/1ab/af40851ab2f1434bacc68ef32510c2c6.jpg"></div><br><br>  Taiwanese company XYZ Printing is one of the companies that are serious about the consumer market, delivering unimaginably cheap products of acceptable quality.

The price of materials ranges from $ 100 to $ 200. <br><br>  A DLP 3D printer also comes bundled, which reduces its cost to $ 3,490.
