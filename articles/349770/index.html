The software industry is not an exception, where the Free Software community is the most striking example of such interactivity, giving everyone the opportunity to take part in creating software products of any complexity, from a simple text editor to the most complex operating system kernel. <br><br>  Vivaldi is a modern company, we try to be at the forefront of technology development, and, naturally, we actively use the possibilities of creating a browser together with our users.  And today we will tell how this happens on the example of the localization of the Vivaldi browser. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, as you might have noticed, Vivaldi is localized into several dozen languages.  In this case, we do not have a localization department.  At all.  And also we do not use the services of relevant agencies.  Absolutely all translations are performed by our volunteer assistants from among users, and in the company one manager is responsible both for interacting with this international team of over 200 translators and for updating translations in Vivaldi products, as well as performing the technical part of the work, correcting various errors and flaws in the browser code related to localization.

      The technical side itself is solved simply: we installed the Weblate translation system on our server and invited everyone to participate in the translation of the browser.  And today in our team there are already more than two hundred translators from 50 countries. <br><br>  Almost all Vivaldi translators went about the same way before joining the volunteer team: <br><br><blockquote>  I used Opera 12 in the past, but then it stopped its development and I began to look for a replacement - I tried Chrome, Firefox, Lunascape, Sleipnir, CoolNovo and other browsers, until I stopped at Maxthon, which I used for two years. <br><br>  Then I learned from a news article that the Vivaldi browser, developed by former Opera employees, has appeared.  And since then I am a user of Vivaldi. </blockquote><br>  <i><b>R3gi</b> , Czech Republic</i> <br><br>  And this path was not always straight: <br><br><blockquote>  A friend told me about the browser.  He said that the new browser is engaged in the development team, which left Opera Software.  I downloaded and installed the browser (it was one of the first TP builds) and ... I didn‚Äôt like it!  Fair!  But over time, the parties that pushed me away began to attract - a custom interface, plenty of settings, and dissimilarity to the fellows. </blockquote><br>  <i><b>Kurai</b> , Ukraine</i> <br><br>  Similarly, the motivation of people who decided to help us with translating the browser into different languages ‚Äã‚Äãroughly coincides: <br><br><blockquote>  I was one of the first users of Vivaldi in my country, and at that time the translation of the Vivaldi interface left much to be desired.  Most menus and dialogs have been translated partially or not at all.  And I realized that the growth in the number of users is possible only when the browser is clear and comfortable for them to use. </blockquote><br>  <i><b>Drahomir Dubina</b> , Czech Republic</i> <br><br><blockquote>  From the very beginning, I realized that this is my browser, and I wanted to take part in improving it.  Having become a translator, I got a lot of pleasure, and also contributed to the way Vivaldi browser looks like, at least in my language. </blockquote><br>  <i><b>Bart≈Çomiej Trzewiczek</b> , Poland</i> <br><br>  It should be noted that all translators understand the importance of localizing software products - in fact, this is also one of the motivating moments: <br><br><blockquote>  Not all users understand English and try to avoid using programs that do not have a translation into their native language.  I thought that it would be nice to have the largest possible number of browser localizations, it is very important for its distribution throughout the world. </blockquote><br>  <i><b>Andrea Gramegna</b> , Italy</i> <br><br><blockquote>  On my computer, I prefer to use only localized software.  The same applies to the operating system that I use.  And I fully understand people who have the same beliefs. </blockquote><br>  <i><b>P.</b> , Poland</i> <br><br><blockquote>  If you want to manage your software, you need to understand it.  If you do not understand it, then many functions will be unknown to you and you will not be able to use the full potential of the program.  It is therefore very important that people understand the software that they use. </blockquote><br>  <i><b>Mat√∫≈° Ba≈àas</b> , Slovakia</i> <br><br>  And finally, people just like to do what they do - it gives them pleasure and the opportunity to make the world a little bit better: <br><br><blockquote>  I do it in my free time, a bit of a hobby.  I just like to create something new. </blockquote><br>  <i><b>Tom Evin</b> , Hungary</i> <br><br>  There is another important aspect in the localization process of Vivaldi - we try to support as many languages ‚Äã‚Äãas possible technically.  And even if the actual Chromium core does not support any languages ‚Äã‚Äãor dialects, we try to give people the opportunity to use the Vivaldi browser in their everyday communication language: <br><br><blockquote>  I will not say that this is something critically important, but it is a good step towards the preservation of various dialects.  Therefore, we must not only translate English terms into the main languages, but also offer programs in dialects that people speak in everyday life. </blockquote><br>  <i><b>Matthieu Gissler</b> , Swiss German</i> <br><br>  So, what are the results of our collaboration?  Today, we have the Vivaldi browser interface, fully translated into 38 languages, while the browser translators themselves have 72 languages ‚Äã‚Äãon the server, the translation process into which is not yet complete.  It should be noted that 29 of them are not supported in Chromium. <br><br>  But this, of course, is not the limit.  We can do much more with our users.  Therefore, if you want to take part in translating the browser into your language - write in the comments to this post or in personal messages to get all the necessary instructions.  Together we can create a truly unique and the best browser in the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/349770/">https://habr.com/ru/post/349770/</a></p>
