Human-oriented design of interactive systems</i> . <i>"</i> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Ergonomics?</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Fi, this is not it!</b>  <b class="spoiler_title">Usability is wider than ergonomics, you say.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Yes, the concept of "usability" includes ergonomics.  But wait: how do they define the ‚Äúhuman-oriented design‚Äù of which standard? <br><br><blockquote>  Human-centered design (human-centered design) is a way of developing interactive systems aimed at creating usable and useful systems ... </blockquote><br>  And here's usability!  ‚ÄúSuitability‚Äù is not a clear phrase, but this is how they translate the word ‚Äúusability‚Äù.  Probably, when the universal comes <s>to ...</s> minimalism, then the GOST of usability will be called the "GOST of usability."  But so far. </div></div><br>  I want to briefly explain why this document is not an empty sound.  Let's go in order. <br><br><h3>  1. Tasks of the document </h3><br>  Who needs it? <br><ul><li>  Managers - to show the place of the human factor and ergonomics in the design process. </li><li>  UX-specialists - to tell how the design takes place, and what is their participation in this process. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  2. Definitions </h3><br>  Russian translation needs some work, but it's a matter of time. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Snarling mode</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Accessibility is usability ‚Äúfor people with the widest range of possibilities.‚Äù  Go guess that the "wide range" refers to people with <i>disabilities</i> . </div></div>  The main thing - the meaning of the document ISO 9241-210: 2010 did not disappear anywhere in the translation.  For example, a couple of quotes: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
    <blockquote>  Systems with high usability have a number of advantages, including better performance, stress prevention, increased availability and reduced risk of harm. </blockquote>  (usability = usability) <br><blockquote>  Suitability, if interpreted in terms of users' personal goals, may include perceptual and emotional aspects, usually associated with user experience.  Usefulness criteria can be used to assess aspects of user experience. </blockquote><br>  GOST - about emotions!  A pleasant surprise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac1/f1e/cd3/ac1f1ecd3a0c837208fe74e568e92fa4.png" alt="GOST on usability. Cover"><br><br><h3>  3. Why think about usability </h3><br>  In the third section, on the whole A4 sheet, various advantages and benefits of human-oriented design are described.  That increasing usability saves millions of dollars is understandable.  But here, down to private work issues: <br><br><blockquote>  ... has a beneficial effect on other aspects of system design, for example, by simplifying the identification and formulation of functional requirements. </blockquote><blockquote>  ... increases the likelihood of successful completion of the project on time and within budget. </blockquote>  :) <br><br><h3>  4. Principles of human-centered design </h3><br>  This standard does not come up with new methodologies, but teaches us how to introduce a human-oriented approach to existing processes.  Just a shift in emphasis. <br><br>  Briefly, the ideas-principles in subsections: <br><br><h5>  4.2.  User needs </h5>  Accurately identify users, tasks, terms of use. <br><br><h5>  4.3.  Involving users in development </h5>  Not only "to order", but also when creating a universal / consumer products. <br><br><h5>  4.4.  Feedback from users </h5>  User feedback (including at the design stage) is the most important source of information. <br><br><hr><br>  How to interpret this information?  The GOST is not written, so I want to stay more.  Let's call this <b>mutual destruction of illusions</b> . <br><br>  The illusion of the designer: <i>"the user's thinking is arranged about the same as mine</i> . <i>"</i> <br>  User‚Äôs illusion: <i>‚Äúcars do not exist, only horses exist‚Äù</i> <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">(fast and slow)</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  "If I asked my future buyers what they needed, they would ask for faster horses." <br><br>  <i><a href="http://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/07/28/ford-faster-horse/">Henry Ford</a> , Founder, Ford Motor Company</i> </div></div><br>  The user does not know what can be done more conveniently. <br><br>  The designer does what is convenient for him.  He has a handy set of user stories - from which the obvious decisions follow - which the user has to <b>put up with</b> . <br><br>  Not. <br><br>  To make a really cool product, you need to get out of your comfort zone and <b>understand what the user needs</b> , provided that he cannot explain it himself. <br><br>  Not a designer, not a user - it should be the third person who will destroy their illusions.  And this will be a new dimension. <br><br><hr><br><h5>  4.5.  Iterative improvement of the project </h5>  This, again, is about user participation in design.  At the beginning it is impossible to provide every detail.  Many needs and expectations of users are revealed only during the design, as developers improve their understanding of users and their tasks, and users describe their wishes in response to the presented design solutions. <br><br><h5>  4.6.  Consider user experience </h5>  Given the previous user experience, you need to keep in mind many aspects.  User‚Äôs personal goals, emotions and perceptions, expectations and satisfaction, packaging and brand image, non-monotony and much more. <br><br><h5>  4.7.  Other design participants </h5>  In addition to UX-specialists and users - who else is involved in the development of UX-design?  These are specialists with different points of view on a project, possessing knowledge in different areas.  Marketers, technical writers, system analysts, all sorts of managers, and even designers. <br><br><a name="HCD_scheme"></a><h3>  5-6.  Project Planning and Implementation </h3><br>  These two sections govern the implementation of the above principles.  I do not want to go into much detail (the purpose of this post is to give a brief overview, to interest).  The document is well structured, so those who wish will quickly find the necessary information. <br><br>  There is a scheme, I signed to it, what issues are considered in each paragraph: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cc5/d63/b60/cc5d63b6036276c8f47f30e8aabb1599.png" alt="Human-oriented design. Scheme"><br><br>  In paragraph 6.3 you can find a couple of interesting points: <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt is necessary to determine the needs that should be met (and not the ways in which these needs should be met)‚Äù.  (6.3.2) <br><br>  "The specification of user requirements should be made taking into account the possibility of testing at later design stages."  (6.3.5) <br><br>  That is, two things are said directly, see above <b>about two illusions</b> : <br>  6.3.2.  The user does not know what he wants.  No cars, only horses. <br>  6.3.5.  We initially could very seriously make a mistake about what the user needs. <br><br>  The axiom about the iterative approach is repeated several times ... Probably, in the future, PMs can safely write: <br>  <i>"Based on clauses 4.1 (d), 4.5, 5.3 (f), 5.5 and 6.4.3 (d), we need to allocate time for another iteration."</i>  :) <br><br><a name="Sustainability"></a><h3>  7. Sustainable development </h3><br>  It says that human-centered design (as described in the standard) plays an extremely positive role in the sustainable development of humanity.  Here I would argue.  The authors of the standard constantly talk about some unconditional, thoughtless maximization of comfort for the consumer. <br><br>  If all our future is to sit on the couch and chew popcorn - then yes, there is everything for sustainable development.  But I think that habrayusers have another idea about the XXII century, to which one of us will live, which means that there is still a very difficult choice: to give a fish or a bait? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203308/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203308/</a></p>
