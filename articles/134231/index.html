  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We work with EMS on violation of the delivery time of packages - instructions</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A recent post in ‚ÄúI resent‚Äù about the work of EMS in our country and the complete carelessness of postal workers revealed the need for instructions on what can be done so that sometime problems with EMS packages have ceased. <br><br>  Immediately upset - the package can not be controlled.  If it doesn‚Äôt "fly" to Russia for a long time (i.e., the Export status is worth it, but Import is not), then it is unlikely that something will help.  However, we insure, we follow the steps described below. <br>  I can also please: 95 percent of the parcels still reach.  The volume for comparisons is about 10 parcels per month from the USA and Europe. <br>  I draw attention to the fact that I receive many parcels (60 percent of all shipments) ‚Äúfrom myself‚Äù using a service like Shipito.  In some cases, this means that the mail cannot refuse claims for the reason that they appear to be "not the sender."  However, in many cases I recommend to go and fight for your package using the processes and documents presented below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Almost always, when the parcel flies to us, we have already obtained its tracking number by some means or by crook (for tracking).  By emspost.ru or russianpost.ru we can track the current status of the parcel. <br>  The most frequent violation of deadlines and loss is the status between Export and Import.  Import may simply not occur.  At this time, by phone they say that "the parcel is prepared for shipment by another country, but the information that it has been sent is not."  The procedure is as follows: after export from the sending country, the parcel arrives at the Customs in Russia, and after that it is ‚Äúreceived‚Äù by EMS (Russian Post). <br><br>  Go: <br>  1) <b>Export status does not change to Import more than 7 days</b> (2-5 days in practice is the norm) - there are many opinions on the Internet about what happens with the package at this time.  Ideally, she came to Russia, admitted by the Customs, but the Post does not take it in time.

      <br>
      In any case, at this stage, a ‚Äúkick‚Äù in the FCS (Federal Customs Service) is needed. <br>  Written appeals can be sent directly via the Internet: <a href="http://reception.customs.ru/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_questions%26Itemid%3D67">Turn to the FCS</a> , section - Non-receipt of IGOs <br><br>  Message content may be as follows: <br>  ‚ÄúDear FCS! <br>  My customized package from ( <i>specify the sending country</i> ) with tracking number "____________" (you <i>specify your tracking number</i> ), has not been sent to Russian Post for more than 7 working days. <br>  I ask you to clarify the situation and explain why you are violating the terms of processing and checking IGOs.  And also provide me with information about the location of my departure. <br>  What actions should I take to receive my shipment? "(The question at the end should sound, but in what form - think out how you are closer)." <br><br>  2) <b>Import status appeared, further plugging</b> <br>  Here it is the work of our Post (or EMS), the actual deadlines for parcels can be found here: <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/rp/servise/ru/home/postuslug/termsdelivery/termsdeliv_external">www.russianpost.ru/rp/servise/ru/home/postuslug/termsdelivery/termsdeliv_external</a> <br><br>  Accordingly, in this part of the violation are addressed to the post of Russia.  I draw your attention that the maximum period in Russia (after Import) for today is 11 days.  If the parcel has not been received within the time specified for your city, we write an application for a search right in the Russian Post office.  There is a difficulty: you will need a document (receipt) of the shipment, so usually I ask the seller to send me a scan of it.  The application is registered (sometimes with fights, but obliged to be done) and now only wait for the results. <br><br>  At the same time, here you can also send a complaint to the Ministry of Communications: <br>  <a href="http://minsvyaz.ru/ru/directions/questioner/">minsvyaz.ru/ru/directions/questioner</a> - briefly describe the situation, at the end spice up the question "how to get?" or "what to do to get?", etc. <br><br>  3) <b>The most interesting.</b>  <b>When the parcel is delivered, but the deadlines are violated</b> <br>  Upon receipt of the parcel apply for compensation in connection with violation of delivery times.  As a recipient, you are entitled to it.  The application is submitted at the post office on the index where the parcel is expected.  With your passport and scan of the receipt of departure.  Sometimes with fights. <br><br>  At the same time, we also create a complaint in the Ministry of Communications: <br>  <a href="http://minsvyaz.ru/ru/directions/questioner/">minsvyaz.ru/ru/directions/questioner</a> - describe the date of passage of the parcel, indicate the number of days, the cost of sending.  Wait for the reaction. <br><br>  When we demand compensation, we follow this document: <br><br><habracut></habracut>  Appendix ‚Ññ 1 <br>  to the order of the FSUE "Russian Post" <br>  14.01.2008 ‚Ññ 1- <br><br>  POSITION <br>  on the procedure for payment of refunds to users of international and domestic express EMS service <br><br>  3.1.2.  The amount of reimbursement for violation of the control dates of shipment and delivery of EMS items (both domestic and international EMS shipments): <br>  In case of violation of the established and valid in the current period of the deadlines for the shipment and delivery of EMS items, the sender shall be paid compensation in the following amounts: <br>  - in case of violation of the control dates of delivery and delivery up to two days inclusive, the sender is paid a refund in the amount of 30 (thirty) percent of the tariff for shipping; <br>  - in case of violation of the deadlines for shipment and delivery from three to five days, inclusive, the sender is paid a refund in the amount of fifty (50) percent of the tariff for shipping; <br>  - in case of violation of the deadlines for shipping and delivery over five days, the sender is paid a refund in the amount of 100 (one hundred) percent of the tariff for shipping. <br><br>  4.1.1.  Terms for making claims by users of EMS services <br>  - on international EMS shipments - within six months from the day following the day the mail was submitted, unless otherwise provided for in bilateral agreements concluded between the FSUE Russian Post and foreign Postal Administrations. <br>  4.1.2.  Terms of consideration of claims <br>  EMS Russian Post considers the application for payment of compensation and gives a written response to the applicant within two months from the date of receipt of the application. <br><br>  <b>While everything is ready to answer emerging questions and share experiences.</b> <br>  I took a lot of information from the sites of ebay-forum, shophelp, but still all the steps described and passed and now described independently. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134231/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134231/</a></p>
