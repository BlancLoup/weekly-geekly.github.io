As a result, artifacts were discovered that have not seen the light for many years. <br>  Photo report inside. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is only a little of the heap of cans with disks that happened to be processed in the past.  A strange feeling arises when you see it all.  Each disc causes, it would seem, completely forgotten details and memories of a particular game.  In each game there was some kind of zest, or a surprise over which it was necessary to work hard before ordinary users can use the translated version.  As if on a time machine, you return to those events. <br>  I sit here and think now what to do.  It's a pity to throw it away ... Maybe everything is in the figure and make an online archive of old toys?  I think a lot of this now is hard to find, even if you want. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/06/04/07/43/3890925_640x480.JPG" alt="Disks">

      And here is the old console, the SEGA Dreamcast, which produced a shock at the first acquaintance - the graphics at that time were so cool.  Somewhere else lying a couple of disks.  Probably I‚Äôll find and try to start it - suddenly and now the graphics will look good? <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/06/04/07/43/3890926_640x480.JPG" alt="Sega dreamcast"><br><br>  Sony Playstation 2. Probably the most popular console of all times and peoples in recent years.  Although I am sure that the owners of the Nintendo GameBoy will be against such a statement.  And yet, almost 10 years on the market is a serious time. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/06/04/07/44/3890928_640x480.JPG" alt="Playstation 2"><br><br>  Just a couple of years before the Playstation 3 was released, a lightweight console was released - the Slim version.  Much smaller and several times smaller in weight than the previous model.  In addition, the developers of something namudri with firmware, so that some games did not want to work normally on this model.  I had to suffer and check that the localized games worked both on the old model and on the new one. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/06/04/07/44/3890935_640x480.JPG" alt="Playstation 2 Slim"><br><br>  Here they are nearby.  What is called, feel the difference. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/06/04/07/44/3890936_640x480.JPG" alt="Playstation 2"><br><br>  Drum roll ... The first Xbox.  Or as it is called the X-box.  For some reason, I remembered when I had the opportunity to communicate with foreigners, then they didn‚Äôt understand our X-Box pronunciation, and somehow their X-Box wasn‚Äôt our liking.  In essence, an ordinary PC with a video card from Nvidia of the GeForce 4 type and a 700 MHz processor (if my memory does not fail me).  But due to the fact that the games were tailored "for iron" - everything flew and produced a very, very good level of graphics. <br><br><img src="http://www.picamatic.com/show/2009/06/04/07/44/3890947_640x480.JPG" alt="Xbox"><br><br>  I think many will find rarities of the game era of past years in the closet or somewhere under the bed.  Maybe try to make a virtual museum?  Although for sure there is already something like that.  It will be necessary to search.  But if not, then the idea has the right to life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61376/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61376/</a></p>
