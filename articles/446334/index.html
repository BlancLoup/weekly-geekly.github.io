  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thinking about IT careers and tips for beginners</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr!  I recently thought a lot about career, the future of our industry and so on.  I decided to write an article for those who are just going to enter here, and in general maybe someone will be interested, all of the following is purely my IMHO and much of what I say applies to other areas, and about half of this is also a caption, but let's start . <br><br><ol><li>  The first thing you need to know: many programmers see themselves as latent millionaires, this is a fundamentally wrong approach.  Do not go here for huge sums of money, the century of startups has passed, but a single programmer takes little value.  95% of developers is a resource that does not solve anything, it makes a profit by reselling its man hours, you will not be able to remove the cream of your labor, as in many professions. </li><li>  The salary of an itnik always has a ceiling, above which 99% will not jump, they will not become evangelicals, stars and other technical directors. </li><li>  Based on the preceding paragraphs: if you really want to make a career or at least not be in the garbage when the industry boom will pass (I don‚Äôt venture to make predictions, but unfortunately it all looks like a bubble, which is also being blown away).  Then pump over soft skills, coolly pump over, give it no less strength than technical skills.  Even Java can die off, but boltology is an effective tool for advancing itself along the career ladder out of centuries, it does not come up with new frameworks, your ability to push something will never become obsolete. </li><li>  Following the same arguments: Learn English.  I understand, you think, what did I say about this new one?  After all, everyone writes everywhere that you need to learn English?  Nevertheless, English is far from being well-known not even by half of it-shnik.  And this part loses to those who know it.  At the moment there is a trend in machine learning, big data and other artificial intelligence.  In Russian, you will not find or practically will not find information to start a career in new areas.  All you can do is wait until some enterprising guys run paid courses, but then the number of people willing to take such positions increases dramatically, wages fall, and how to develop further if areas go ahead, and you cannot raise your qualifications from for the language?  You will be waiting for the courses again. <br><br>  And again, English will not become obsolete, you want to change the scope of activities, and this will be a plus wherever you go. </li><li>  Do not believe those who say that QA / QC / 1C / ‚Äúinsert the name of a 'prestigious career' is stupid, boring, only fools and losers work there.  For some reason, young specialists are drawn in java, angulyara, python and other languages ‚Äã‚Äãand technologies that, as it were, say: look, I am the elite.  Most likely in your career as a programmer, you will write form and drive data from the base to the base, which is not much different from what your colleagues will do with 1c-nicknames.  The difference will be that 1c-nick is needed by any business, always, and will be needed for a long time.  In addition, such experts are often pumped in related areas such as accounting, and generally keep abreast of the business, if it is a regular 1snik.  They are much more likely to open their non-technological business, as they know how the processes are organized.  They know how to communicate with aunts from accounting and sales, they themselves, of course, always complain that we‚Äôre tired of it, we don‚Äôt want to communicate with them, but the use of this skill cannot be denied, the ability to get along with such an audience opens up different possibilities in life.  Not to mention the fact that useful business dating there is much easier to get there than in an outsourcing company.

      While among qa a record high concentration of random people, there are far fewer good specialists than in development.  Absolutely real case: a person with an outstretched hand was knocking thresholds for an intern / juniora position, having a good background, but without fanaticism, was denied even $ 500, because the market was crawling with all sorts of djunas with burning eyes.  Tired, disappointed, spat, I learned the theory of testing, in the end, because of real skills in writing code and working with a debugger (which is not particularly superfluous in the train) I got 4 offers for the week and starting salary of $ 1000 without work experience. </li><li>  Do not become attached to frameworks, study the base.  The frameworks are new every year. </li><li>  Do not put eggs in one basket, maybe you will burn out, you will want to leave here, but the world is big and scary, and all you can do is write code.  Learn related and not-so areas, digital marketing, smm, law in the end, something that you are interested in and that you can apply in the future.  By God, once they were able to master Java and cope with it somehow. </li><li>  Watch your money, IT at the moment is an amazing area where you can earn good money, being an employee, but, as I already wrote, it will not make you a millionaire.  I know many experts in our area with salaries ranging from $ 3,500, who nevertheless live from paycheck to paycheck, because by their 35 years they have managed to amass a huge pile of liabilities, which monthly extort money from them.  Do not fall into this situation. </li></ol></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/446334/">https://habr.com/ru/post/446334/</a></p>
