  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SCRUM and its implementation in my company. Start</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The beginning is prosaic.  Namely - how I work.  The owner of the company comes, tells me the task, I crush it myself and do it.  Then another team appeared in my team and I began to split up the tasks into two of us.  If I had something that did not work or there was some kind of gag, I turned to the developer on another technology.  He helped me and was a kind of my technical supervisor.  For example: when I wanted to write a new project on Zend, and not on Codeigniter'e (in which we have all the projects), he gave me two weeks: if I don‚Äôt have time, then on Codeigniter'e quickly in two days, I did.  The only minus that I saw in my work is the complete lack of testing on my part and the tester as such. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why did you decide to implement SCRUM </h4><br>  So, next door there is another project.  The people in it constantly argue, shout and discuss something for two, three hours.  Expressed leader as on our side, they do not.  And everything would be fine, but then Scram came to our abode, which in essence was intended to make a team out of this department, and our department was taken as a company, if implemented, it would be like that everywhere.  At first I was delighted, we now had one tester for two teams.  And in the development of scams, you must write unit tests.  "Cool" - I thought, now I will not write on Saturdays: "repair - something does not work."  And everything will be in openwork. <br><br><h4>  And the training was held </h4><br>  The impression is twofold, I realized that now not only the neighbors will have shouts and discussion for an hour, two at a time, now it will come to ‚Äúour land‚Äù.  Now everyone has a personality, everyone expresses his weighty opinion.  And no one is responsible for anything, because now all the team is responsible for everything.  We had a task at the training, there was a Lego, there was a customer and there were two teams.  Two hours of time.  The task is to build a city.  We began by identifying the most important things for the customer.  Without which, his project simply will not exist.  Smashed the complexity of the task.  Started to do.  And then the mess became in all its glory.  Whoever grabbed the leaflet with the estimated task first, does it, and to the question, let me help you, sends it far into the forest.  In this iteration, the designer was the most agile, the others simply poked around in the details and pretended that they were doing something important.  At the next iteration, in order not to stand aside again, everyone grabbed a task that he could not pull.  Overwhelmed.  Well, not everything to be overwhelmed, the customer received somewhere between 50-70% of what they set up.  It is worth noting that the assessment of complexity and the very tinkering in the constructor in time was strikingly different.  Estimated more than an hour ... What else should be noted, the people were delighted when they learned that the sprint can be failed.  And yes, we built a city, but without a shop.  The store failed and the customer‚Äôs money ran out.  Now residents will eat worms.

    <h4>  Results </h4><br>  What I have made for myself so far, we will now work in an emergency mode during the sprint, in fact, not bad, because I can now beat out the time to write tests during the rally (I call the meetings myself, the beginning and end of the sprint).  What I definitely like.  After all, I used to work this way all the time, in emergency mode, and now I will have a sprint and tasks for it.  And the tasks ‚Äúit was necessary yesterday‚Äù I hope will disappear from my life, and the whole project will be covered with tests.  Another plus, I will communicate more with people.  Although this is a minus because the meetings have the tendency to develop into hours-long disputes, at the end of which, everyone already by and large accrues to the result, if only it is over.  There will be creativity in the project, that is, when one person decides - this is one thing, and what is born during the discussion is usually better and the reasonableness of the issue becomes greater.  The disadvantage of this approach is that the meetings have the tendency to grow into disputes for many hours, and the work will be in place. <br><br>  In general, we hope for the best. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118658/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118658/</a></p>
