  <section class="page js-page"><h1>California is asking Apple to explain why the company does not allow users to repair their phones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e49/d5a/868/e49d5a868a6b8b6460341a95dc0bea01.jpg"><br><br>  Companies that prevent the DIY-repair of their devices and systems have long been known.  First of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/278644/">all,</a> it is a manufacturer of tractors and agricultural equipment John Deere.  This company is a true professional in the repair bans, which was repeatedly <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/287192/">written</a> to Geektimes.  In addition, Apple also creates problems for users who want to repair their devices. <br><br>  In the case of the Cupertino company, this is not a direct ban on repairs ( <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/277178/">although ...</a> ).  But Apple does not sell parts in open access, anyone can not buy them.  Yes, you can purchase a used item or a new part, which is a replica of the original.  However, you cannot buy a new screen directly from Apple.  Original spare parts are only certified service centers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the US, they have been trying to stop this practice for a long time, forcing Apple to sell its parts to anyone who may need them.  In addition, the company has ways to get the user to contact their own service centers.  For example, in the iPhone with a button equipped with a fingerprint sensor (models 5s to 7) there is a chip that ‚Äúmonitors‚Äù which motherboard is installed in the phone.  If the one with which the button was originally supplied, the sensor will work.  If the button is rearranged to another phone, or to order a replica of the button in China, the sensor stops working.  In the "sevens" besides the sensor, the button itself will refuse to function, so it will have to use the on-screen one.

      The ability to reflash the button so that it works with the new phone, only Apple has, it uses specialized systems that are secret (at least a network of photos of such devices is on the network).  The Chinese button is on eBay a few dollars, and this is a complete copy of the original, and you can put it yourself, it is not very difficult.  But if you need a dactyloscopic sensor, you will need to contact Apple's service center, where a few dozen, if not a hundred, US dollars will be taken for the correct replacement while maintaining the sensor functionality. <br><br>  Apple says that "protectionist policies" are caused by customer care.  Allegedly, the company does not want its phones to be repaired by non-professionals, which will damage the image of Apple - after all, poorly repaired phones will not work well.  Well, in fact, the corporation just gets a lot of money from its service centers and does not want the river to suddenly dry up the money. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eb0/9d8/c9e/eb09d8c9ee6aeb662cebbe4c1b9fe675.jpg"><br>  <i><font color="gray">Apple Pros and Cons</font></i> <br><br>  Users don‚Äôt really like it, so in the US Apple is <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/nz85y7/apple-is-lobbying-against-your-right-to-repair-iphones-new-york-state-records-confirm">actively fighting</a> for repairs.  Lawsuits are filed in 11 US states, and several more are being prepared right now.  Consumer Technology Association, representing the interests of service centers and electronics manufacturers, also opposes Apple‚Äôs policy, as unauthorized service centers and vendors are simply unable to carry out repairs at the level of those organizations that have been certified by the corporation. <br><br>  It is clear that not only Apple, but also a large number of other, large and not very large, companies earn on maintenance and service. <br><br>  Now legislators, in particular, senators, have noticed the problem.  Thus, California senator Susan Talamantes-Eggman (Susan Talamantes-Eggman) announced its intention to introduce a <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xdp94/right-to-repair-california-bill">bill</a> obliging companies like Apple, Microsoft, John Deere and Samsung to sell their parts to everyone.  Also, the bill will provide an opportunity to carry out equipment diagnostics with the help of licensed service software to any service centers and independent stores. <br><br><img src="https://www.deere.ua/assets/images/region-4/products/tractors/row-crop-tractors/row-crop-group/8family-rowcrop-r4d054782.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúApple is a very important company for the state of California, and I respect her very much.  But I would like to hear from them an explanation of why we cannot repair our own things, and how much damage the company can cause to change such a policy, ‚Äùthe senator said.  She will fight not only for the rights of owners of electronics, but also for the rights of those same owners of tractors, which are restricted by John Deere. <br><br>  Interestingly, even Apple authorized service centers have no right to carry out complex repair of devices.  If, for example, the backlight of the phone screen stops working, the service center is obliged to send such a gadget to Apple, where the company will repair or replace it.  Of course, hundreds and thousands of craftsmen do not pay any attention to the ban, but this is a violation of Apple‚Äôs policy, for which, in theory, the company can sue. <br><br>  If the prohibitive policies of monopolistic companies are removed, the repair and maintenance of their systems and devices will become much cheaper, which, of course, buyers want.  It is rather strange that the owner of a device or mechanism cannot do anything with it, but is obliged to seek permission from the manufacturing company or the licensee. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/411007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/411007/</a></p>
