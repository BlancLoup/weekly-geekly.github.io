On the first day of the iPhone 5s sales, I managed to get the Space Gray color novelty.  I would like to share with you my impressions about the week of life with Apple's flagship and, of course, to demonstrate a detailed review and comparison with the iPhone 5. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>First, the review itself</b>

Before the presentation, as usual, you sit and think: ‚ÄúI know everything about this 5s, I don‚Äôt want it, I don‚Äôt need it, I‚Äôm like with the 5th year more‚Äù.  The presentation ends and the thoughts are already blowing in a completely different direction.  That is how the iPhone 5s appeared on my very first day of sales. <br><br>  I got a model from Munich, this is the A1457 model, which can work with Russian LTE networks, but more on that later. <br><br>  So, <b>iPhone 5s</b> <br><br>  OS: iOS 7 <br>  Processor: Apple A7 + Apple M7 <br>  RAM: 1 GB <br>  Weight: 112g <br>  Dimensions: 58.6x123.8x7.6 mm <br>  Screen: 4 ', 640x1136 px, PPI 326 <br>  Camera: 8 megapixel, dual LED flash <br>  Front camera: 1.2 MP <br>  Battery capacity: 1560 mAh <br>  SIM card type: Nano-SIM <br><br>  We always value new devices ‚Äúby clothes,‚Äù just like people.  And this is not without it, Space Gray-color is very different from the usual black, but the appearance of the 5s is much more presentable than its predecessor, since the edges became silver, some chrome elements appeared and the color of the back cover itself became slightly lighter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/b35/68c/4f4/b3568c4f492366ded49d97bf26ac6c35.png"><br><br>  The second thing that made love to 5s in a jiffy is Touch ID.  I'm sure you read a lot about this feature, so I don‚Äôt see any sense in describing how it works.  Let me just say that the biometric sensor performs its role by almost 100%, since the finger definition in 9 out of 10 cases occurs accurately and instantly. <br><br>  By the way, the button itself looks very much even nothing, it is now ‚Äúpuffy‚Äù and straight, and it is more pleasant to press.  Although it is probably a new sensation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/7d4/49e/7fb/7d449e7fbc3e4d9ac84c79837e98e80e.png"><br><br>  The phone itself looks, feels in hand, weight and tactile from the iPhone 5 is no different.  All the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f09/26d/295/f0926d29533a09ba7804967233b4e0fa.png"><br><br>  <b>Camera</b> <br><br>  The third thing you liked.  Slow Motion Video!  This is really a very cool feature of the device: it‚Äôs like a children's toy, but I already have all the memory of the phone full of slow-motion videos, as shooting my friends, their faces, some smoke rings are all very fun.  And considering that now the main ‚Äúfixer‚Äù of drunken parties is a telephone and that it has already become common with our life - it becomes even more fun to shoot at 120 FPS. <br><br>  Here are a few examples that I took: <a href="http://instagram.com/p/emJuf7nb5H/">one</a> <a href="http://instagram.com/p/ek6kPpnbw0/">two</a> <a href="http://instagram.com/p/enPvQZHb3j/">three</a> <br><br>  Also, in the review itself (above) there are other shots in sunlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/677/2ef/10b/6772ef10b490c61dee0db7b1282d9622.png"><br><br>  With the photo, too, everything became much more optimistic, especially the front-facing camera.  She began to shoot much more detailed in light and much lighter in the dark. <br><br>  Happy: <a href="">iPhone 5s</a> and <a href="">iPhone 5</a> <br><br>  Night: <a href="">iPhone 5S</a> and <a href="">iPhone 5</a> <br><br>  Main camera <br><br>  Crop 100% <br><br>  iPhone 5s <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/92f/94f/916/92f94f916b9a0e57065adf3cfd480da5.png"><br><br>  iPhone 5 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/0a5/a83/ceb/0a5a83ceb6026c63d8f29cf07347dba2.png"><br><br>  <b>Rest</b> <br><br>  In addition to all this, the iPhone 5s has other distinctive features.  64-bit iOS 7, Apple A7 processor, M7 coprocessor, which is responsible for motion sensors and removes the load from the main chip.  But in fact for me personally, for my needs, all this is ‚Äúnonsense of a marketer,‚Äù which does not affect the daily use of the phone.  64 bits, new processor?  My iPhone 5, which is still working with me a little worse than 5s, then what could be the reasons? <br><br>  Yes, in the iPhone 5s the graphics in Infinity Blade 3 are better, but in the mobile version of iMovie, the rendering is 2 times faster, but wait ... Is the render in iMovie on the phone?  It seems to me that few need it.  Infinity Blade 3?  I play only in the Impossible Game for the 2nd year already, nothing else is needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/4f9/730/966/4f9730966e6a5563d8cb9b81316d9683.png"><br><br>  Hence the conclusion: the iPhone 5s is good for its new, but not numerous functions, like Touch ID and Slo-Mo, but the technical component is not much different from the iPhone 5, so for those who want to buy 5s for themselves, but not very inclined to give their fingerprints to the FBI or not to use the camera on the phone at all - they can sit quietly on last year‚Äôs model.  But still there is one "but" ... <br><br>  LTE network.  iPhone 5s should work in the Russian 4G-frequencies, but at the moment the phone is software deprived of such an opportunity.  And judging by the articles, perhaps only the official PCT 5s will get this opportunity.  Although, a couple of days later, after the start of sales of the novelty, I called up with Megafon's PR manager, Pavel Larin, he replied that most likely they would fix it. <br><br>  It seems to me that it is necessary to wait for the start of official sales and already look at the prices, and then decide whether the phone is needed at all and need gray or official 5s. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195646/</a></p>
