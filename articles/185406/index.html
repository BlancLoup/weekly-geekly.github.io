Today to be <br>  We cheer for jumper lifters. <br>  In the semi-finals of our Russians <br>  One made its way from the entire application - <br>  From Syktyvkar young athlete. <br>  From the coaching did not put on him <br>  None of the headquarters, but in the semifinals <br>  The guy broke through contrary to forecasts <br>  And it will qualify for the final ... <br>  Cheer for Beslan Shpindaraki! <br><br>  <b>Vaskin</b> <br>  Yes it is Beska! <br><br>  <b>Anna</b> <br>  What, your friend? <br><br>  <b>Vaskin</b> <br>  I studied with Beskoy in one class! <br>  We sat at a desk with him. <br>  He used to be teased by Shpendik - <br>  He cried in the corner, that's an eccentric! <br><br>  <b>Anna</b> <br>  I thought athletes are in olympic <br>  Sports schools are trained. <br><br>  <b>Vaskin</b> <br>  Him <br>  In the sports school from the second took the class. <br>  Beskoy and I were selected to watch: <br>  Competitions for children on the jump. <br>  I got sick, caught a cold <br>  And Beska won a prize <br>  And a year later I went to a sports school. <br>  Just think, Beska Shpindaraki! <br>  In the semifinals!  But I told him <br>  Envied then - not in vain, as you can see! <br>  How he felt that he would be chosen, <br>  On training in Syktyvkar ukatit, <br>  And I will stay.  So worried <br>  He spat on his plate of frustration. <br><br>  <b>Anna</b> <br>  What, right on the plate? <br><br>  <b>Vaskin</b> <br>  Very funny: <br>  Buddy in the bowl of soup spit. <br>  To whom you will tell, will not believe after all - <br>  Fifteen years ago, it was all. <br>  You imagine?! <br><br>  <b>Commentator</b> <br>  I represent everyone <br>  Members of the current zapryga. <br>  On the inside track will start <br>  Ethiopian athlete famous - <br>  Ngujahu Babihone.  He is a winner <br>  Past world cup <br>  Indoors.  The second <br>  French jumper lifter starts <br>  Anselmo Perez, light middleweight, <br>  In this season, the leader. <br>  Following the Frenchman lead the projectile <br>  Thirty Years Old Cuban <br>  Gotana Salvasore.  Him <br>  Of the semifinalists highest <br>  Current rating.  Oh so hard <br>  We'll have Syktyvkar athlete! <br>  But he is focused and ready <br>  At least from the stands of the tribune to jump. <br>  Cheer, Shpindaraki, for you - <br>  All Russians support you. <br>  And now the irresistible gong sounds! <br>  Fortunately, without a false start ... Shpindaraki, <br>  At the start, linger, on the second <br>  Cast while on the jump track <br>  But nothing, everything can make up ... <br>  But what is it?  What happened?! <br>  Salvasore began to smoke jump. <br>  Technical problems with jump! <br>  Cuban who captured from the start <br>  Second - extremely profitable - a place <br>  Bypassing Perez, and behind him, and our <br>  Athlete from Syktyvkar gifted. <br>  Together they pursue the fact <br>  Who is ahead - Nguzhadzhu Babihone. <br>  But is it really going to go the distance <br>  Gotana Salvasore ?!  What can you say? <br>  Yes, in sport there are no trifles: <br>  The tiniest one flaw, <br>  Second delay - and the athlete <br>  Deprived of a well-deserved reward. <br>  Cuban curb at the brakes, <br>  At the Olympic Games performance <br>  Finishing ... How upset he is, <br>  The wife of an athlete is his whole team! <br>  After all, preparing for the Games to begin <br>  Comes with an infant diaper. <br>  Attention!  For the first charge <br>  The Frenchman leaves.  From the side track <br>  The charger is approaching it. <br>  Remind you: no right <br>  Contenders to prevent the charger. <br>  And if prevented, warning <br>  May be rendered.  Sometimes <br>  Guilty from the track even asking ... <br>  Oh, it is!  Did you notice <br>  French charger error? <br>  He jumped the road jump <br>  Beslan Shpindaraki as a result <br>  What athlete lost our speed. <br>  Punished such ... Where are the judges? <br>  Slovak brigade of judges where ?! <br>  Is it possible not to notice? <br>  Ile rules do not comply <br>  Allowed? .. Well, thank God, red <br>  Judge jump hurries to intercept <br>  Frenchman to remove from the competition. <br>  No, just fine?  One hundred and fifty points? <br>  But still: Frenchman Anselmo Perez <br>  No hope for the final - <br>  One hundred and fifty points will not win. <br>  Hanging up, he jumps <br>  Back in the locker room with unfeigned <br>  Offended on face.  Bad luck! <br>  But lucky maybe Shpindaraki <br>  Meanwhile after twenty laps <br>  Lead Ngujaja Babihone. <br>  Recharged, fast Ethiopian <br>  Flies on the wings to the finish line, <br>  And Shpindaraki from last forces <br>  At the tail of Babihon hold on <br>  Tries  It all depends on <br>  Moral-strong-willed athlete qualities: <br>  He will win, who has a stronger attitude, <br>  Who is more focused on winning ... <br>  Ay-yay-yay-yay!  Have you seen which <br>  Confusion occurred at Babihone? <br>  Sank at the turn of the Ethiopian <br>  Allowing a liftingist from Russia <br>  Get close to a distance of two <br>  Three meters from the projectile.  Shpindaraki <br>  I did not miss my opportunity: <br>  Oscillating motion of the jumper - <br>  And now dangles there - <br>  Here in her projectile Babihon, <br>  And our cold-blooded winner <br>  Crosses the finish tape. <br>  Oh, let the spirit translate! <br>  And I do not remember right away how to win <br>  Technical knockout at the end <br>  Such a hard race got it. <br>  Ay yes Beslan!
