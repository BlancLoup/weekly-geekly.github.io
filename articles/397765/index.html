  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Turkish company has developed real autobot transformers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39e/5a4/07d/39e5a407dc1c45de904fb0f6d6e602f6.jpg"><br><br>  Transforming robots became mainstream long before the first movie about them came out in 2007.  For several decades, the most popular goods in toy stores have been them - anthropomorphic robots transforming into cars and other mechanisms.  Some of these toys can be called high-tech - they can turn into a car, a dinosaur or a plane by pressing a button.  The advanced ones have electronic components and a remote control system. <br><br>  Enthusiasts for the love of robots turned their cars into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D04G76L8gW8k">something similar</a> to the transformers.  But such projects are technically difficult to implement, so they are few.  Now the Turkish company <a href="http://www.letrons.com/index_eng.html">Letvision</a> decided to correct this defect.  Her specialization is the creation of real cars that can drive on roads, and which at the touch of a button turn into Letrons robots. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And this is not at all a concept - the company showed working prototypes of transforming robots.  One of them is based on the platform of the 2013 BMW.  The authors of the idea take a real car and modify it, turning it into a robotic system.  Car models can be almost any.  Perhaps there are some limitations, but so far the authors of the project have not reported anything about this.

The fact is that you can only drive such a car remotely.  There is simply no room inside the cabin.  And there is no salon, per se.  All internal space is occupied by electronic components and hydraulics.  In the near future, developers are planning to solve the problem with the dimensions of the electronic-hydraulic system of the robot.  In this case, the robot can be controlled in the folded state by a person who is in the cabin itself. <br><br>  According to the company, robots will be able to move independently after completion.  Transformer models (there are four of them) can and should be improved, according to the developers.  But for this you need to carry out additional work, which requires funds.  The manufacturer‚Äôs website states that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating the Letronov emerged from a discussion of the need to launch some kind of unique and futuristic project.  Not so much time passed from the appearance of the idea to its realization - only 8 months. <br><br>  The Letrons team now includes 12 engineers and 4 technicians.  The mechanical part of the models is created in the main office of the company in Ankara, the software is written by a remote team. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-RHTwdVTer8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3>  Letron specifications </h3><br>  Each robot can rotate its head by 120 degrees due to the presence of a servo in the ‚Äúneck‚Äù.  The ‚Äúneck‚Äù and the main functional part of the robot are connected by a special actuating device with a force of 1000 N. In the theory of automatic control, an actuating <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">device</a> that transmits the effect from the control device to the control object is referred to as the actuator. <br><br>  Fingers, hands, wrists of transformers are mobile due to hidden servo drives. <br><br>  The process of transforming a car into a robot with reverse transformation is possible thanks to a powerful hydraulic system of 35,000 N divided into several auxiliary systems.  The engine system with a torque of 400 Nm takes up little space. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LCAMH_E8rbM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  It is controlled by a transformer remotely using a wireless system.  The data transfer rate over the Wi-Fi channel is 54 Mbps (802.11a standard).  The robot is equipped with a video camera that transmits real-time video to the operator.  The system has sensors that allow the robot to respond to sound.  On the "belly" of the robot developers have placed the display.  With it, a transformer can communicate with people, showing important information for the operator.  Front and rear security sensors are located.  If the computer detects an obstacle, the robot stops.  The transformer receives energy from batteries with a 4 kW inverter. <br><br>  Now the company has shown 4 models of robots based on different cars.  Video is only for one of the models, all the others are shown in the photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/492/27a/85f/49227a85f963b42ab8cf7efd6026f870.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/221/8e6/e61/2218e6e61dafd8c8047111c7f66aeb5f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0cf/4a3/e16/0cf4a3e162f9786c7bd7d0c7bf1d8958.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/562/91b/c00/56291bc00a1ada6ee3eb7893a35e53e8.jpg"><br><br>  If you are thinking about buying, for now you have to wait: Turkish transformers are temporarily not sold.  But if the project receives sufficient funding (the developers do not explain what ‚Äúsufficient funding‚Äù means), then the project can become commercial, and robots will start to be made for sale. <br><br>  In principle, it is quite possible that all this is a duck, and the Turks simply decided to draw attention to their company or to themselves.  This version also can not be completely dismissed. <br><br>  On its website, the developers <a href="http://www.letrons.com/index_eng.html">claim</a> that the company is supported by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Turkey.  It is also reported that the company has repeatedly received awards and grants, because the company Letvision recognized successful.  Levision collaborates on a number of projects with INTEL and Microsoft. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/397765/">https://habr.com/ru/post/397765/</a></p>
