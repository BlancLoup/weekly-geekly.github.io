  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Competition "NOKIA LUMIA 920 REVIEW": the best</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Two months ago, a contest about the posts on Nokia Lumia 920 started on Habr√©, we received many good works and would like to mention the most interesting ones. <br>  The most popular category of posts is ‚ÄúFirst acquaintance‚Äù.  This is not surprising, for many participants of the contest Nokia Lumia 920 became the first device on the Windows Phone 8 operating system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e51/db7/3cc/e51db73cc888581ea1761aad6e17c359.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Most of the participants chose the way of comparison with products from other manufacturers, and both with top models ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/nokia/lumia920/post/1159/">Is there life after Android</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/nokia/lumia920/post/929/">Overview of the most intriguing smartphone of the year</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/nokia/lumia920/post/327/">Life of others</a> ), and with devices that are representatives of a completely different niche, both in terms of price and functional ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/nokia/lumia920/post/1187/">Nokia Lumia 920 vs BlackBerry Bold 9900. Unusual comparison</a> ).

      A small quote from the post "The <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/nokia/lumia920/post/327/">Life of Others</a> ": <br><blockquote>  All devices are very different for different people.  It was the life of others - a life in which there is no place for desktop wallpaper and time wasting on any settings.  And I respect the choice of these people. <br>  In the end, the Nokia phone first of all told me "Goodbye." </blockquote><br><br>  We especially appreciate the desire of most authors to be objective and to write not only about the merits, but also about the shortcomings that they encountered in the testing process. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/darkbyte/" class="user_link">DarkByte</a> as a whole built his review ‚Äúby contradiction‚Äù: instead of writing the pros, what a huge amount of materials are devoted to, he talks about what flaws and roughness he sees in the model.  17 votes cast for his post, talking about the validity of this approach.  We will be happy to answer some of the comments. <br><br>  For example, Darkbyte writes: <br><blockquote>  First of all, I decided to see how the camera works, and was just shocked.  Of the 10 photos taken, eight turned out to be blurry.  What kind of optical stabilization is there?  Later it was found that the phone is much better, compared to other models, shoots in poor light conditions than in daylight.  That is, the developers have tried to adapt it to the conditions of poor light.  But why did the quality of frames suffer under good light conditions?  Unclear! </blockquote><br><br>  From ourselves we can only comment on what we have already told about software updates, which significantly improves the quality of images taken in daylight.  If you missed - look in our post ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Nokia/blog/174969/">Nokia Lumia 920 against the spring sun</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote>  Connect to the phone mouse and keyboard either via USB or via Bluetooth did not work, which is a pity.  Actually, it was not possible to connect the phone to the computer ... </blockquote><br><br>  Here we are confused, because other testers on the contrary noted the ease of connecting the phone to a computer. <br><br>  In the end, the author concludes: <br><blockquote>  As always, Nokia was on top in terms of iron.  Although with the software this time somehow did not work.  It remains to be hoped that problems will someday be fixed - it‚Äôs not for nothing that the phone sends up to 10 megabytes of error reports to Microsoft every week. </blockquote><br><br>  And here DarkByte is a bit crafty, because the screenshots presented speak of sending 2 MB of reviews per week, and the figure of 10 MB is indicated as the maximum possible. <br><br>  One of the most burning topics, which the participants of our competition paid close attention to, is the cartographic services and navigation of Nokia. <br><br>  Alexey aka <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/boomburum/" class="user_link">Boomburum</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/nokia/lumia920/post/989/">spoke</a> about our maps: <br><blockquote>  ... before the trip, I uploaded 300 megabytes of Spain, which allowed me to navigate in my new place like at home.  Map detailing is very cool - both streets, and POIs, and that‚Äôs all.  Any "Yandex.Maps" is not yet dreaming, and most importantly - no binding to the data on the server - the map is already in the phone, it does not load in chunks for hours, it scales instantly and without loss of quality. </blockquote><br><br>  Of course, we are very pleased to read such reviews.  Although there are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/nokia/lumia920/post/325/">opposing</a> opinions: <br><blockquote>  The phone could not be used as a navigator.  Nokia's built-in navigator simply did not know the street I needed in the near Moscow region, so I had to immediately exclude it from consideration.  Yandex maps in navigator mode ... This is not at all Yandex. Navigator.  And of course, without much-needed driving voice search. </blockquote><br><br>  Both positions are supported by personal experience of use.  Note, however, that the majority of users highlight the positive performance of maps in offline mode as a positive feature. <br><br>  If you want to argue with the participants of the competition, support them or join the fight for the prize fund yourself, hurry: the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/nokia/lumia920/rules/">works are accepted</a> until April 20, inclusive. <br><br>  We, in turn, wish good luck to all participants. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177325/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177325/</a></p>
