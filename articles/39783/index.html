  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The rule of one gift</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  And so, my past thought about the night essence of the workers in the IT industry has generated quite a heated discussion.  (http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/39723/) Therefore, I considered it necessary to somehow develop this topic, or at least to write something that would interest the readers and give rise to an idea for discussion.  According to the tradition I have adopted, I want to again introduce some research into fiction in the topic and draw a parallel.  This time, I was interested in the rule of the so-called ‚Äúone gift‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Many of my computer programmers (let me use this word) fall under this rule 100%.  The essence of this rule is: <i><b>‚ÄúThere are no two real talents in the human soul ... ... You cannot be both a great warrior and a sophisticated wizard.</b></i>  <i><b>Only one thing.</b></i>  <i><b>Your body serves either as a weapon in and of itself, or it is simply the means by which you turn to transcendent forces</b></i> . <i><b>‚Äù</b></i>  That is, if you chose a path, for example, a programmer, then an artist, or even a musician, will not make you so that you do not.  In principle, a stupid and meaningless rule, but if you think about it ... <br><br>  After all, computer skills are real talent.  Otherwise, how can you explain that some people, even having been born in the age of Pentiums and Athletes, are not able to do anything more serious than decomposing Solitaire Solitaire ... Besides, you may have noticed that after someone else was sitting behind a fully functional computer, then the machine starts to hang, to brake and in general, to behave inadequately.  That is, it can be assumed that the technique itself rejects certain people, and takes others in its arms.

      Perhaps all this comes from the fact that obtaining certain skills requires a lot of time, which is never enough.  However, I think a lot of people, in particular those who studied at the university, had to help people do different things with the computer who in other subjects were ‚Äúabove all praise and worthy of imitation‚Äù. <br><br>  In contrast to myself, I want to say that many, of course, have abilities to completely opposite elements (as I know a person who is well versed in the code, plays the guitar, rolls on the board, etc.) However, to develop all these directions to the level that he would like to, still does not work. <br><br>  Maybe, of course, everything depends on a person, and you just need to learn to do what is necessary ... And maybe there is someone who still gives people a certain gift, and even all human will and desire is powerless against it ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39783/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39783/</a></p>
