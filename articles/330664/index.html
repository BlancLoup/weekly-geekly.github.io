An autoscale load-balanced web service using the example of Bitrix in the Google Cloud Platform</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Immediately it is worth making a reservation that this article was written more likely not to show the possibility of the work of this product on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), it will work without it.  Bitrix was taken for experiences simply as a popular platform.  He himself is able to build pools, nodes, etc. in his ‚Äúweb environment‚Äù, though with his own rakes.  And that is why even Debian machines were taken for tests, and not the CentOS beloved by all. <br><br>  In fact, the material is applicable to many web projects.  More precisely, this is a simple guide to building fault-tolerant and distributed applications based on Google Compute Engine virtual machines, Google Cloud SQL databases and Google load balancer. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Dear Bitrix experts and professionals, there are a lot of options for implementing this solution, only one is given here.  You can consider virtual machines, containers, and Google App Engine as a cloud platform.  Plus to all will be the ability to connect storage Google Storage, which was included in the engine for quite some time.  In general, I will be happy to discuss the possibility of sharing Bitrix pilot on the GCP, perhaps it will be your experience that will be described next time as applicable specifically to Bitrix.

    <h3>  Let's get started </h3><br>  What is Bitrix, we will not explain for a long time.  This is a professional web project management system and a huge number of corporate sites, online stores, portals and communities work on it. <br><br>  Despite the volume of text with pictures, the whole deployment procedure took me about two hours, taking into account the caught grabelek. <br><br><h3>  Start by creating a database </h3><br>  <b>Menu ‚Üí Cloud SQL ‚Üí Create Instance</b> <br><br>  Choose MySQL, ‚ÄúNext‚Äù, ‚ÄúCreate a second generation database‚Äù. <br><br>  Specify the database name, location, zone, machine size, disk type, storage size, backup schedule, root password, timeout for those.  Service, add network.  I chose a 1vCPU machine, 1.7Gb RAM and 200GB of normal HDD storage for the test, then we can change it.  When you create a database, pay attention to the zone, it will be located virtual machine. <br><br>  The allowed test network can be set to <i>0.0.0.0/0</i> (all) and connected directly.  But we will do the right thing and do it humanly, we will not indicate anything here, safety is more important. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/24d/2d1/bfa/24d2d1bfabde7dfc76444bf98e81922a.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Next we need to set up a service account.  Immediately make a reservation for what it is needed.  If you connect to the database directly by its IP address, you can skip this step.  We will need an account for a secure connection through a proxy.  Otherwise, the machine will be created with a default entry that does not have access to other services. <br><br>  So, open the menu, go to <b>IAM and Administration ‚Üí Service Accounts ‚Üí Create Service Account</b> .  Name and ID indicate your taste, choose the role of <b>Cloud SQL ‚Üí Client Cloud SQL</b> .  OK, done. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/422/34b/7a5/42234b7a56febcbfe747da4b6fd87dcd.png" alt="image"></div><br>  Deal with the base. <br><br><h3>  Create a virtual machine </h3><br>  Click on the ‚Äúsandwich‚Äù <b>(Menu) ‚Üí Compute Engine ‚Üí VM Instances ‚Üí Create Instance</b> . <br><br>  Take the image of Debian 8 or whatever.  We take to start a simple machine: 1 core, 3.5 GB of RAM. <br><br>  We change the service account of the machine to the one we created in the previous step (to communicate with our Cloud SQL. We put the checkboxes ‚Äúallow HTTP‚Äù and ‚Äúenable HTTPS‚Äù depending on the planned protocol. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/167/2ed/f3e/1672edf3e45c032b6488a37a6187a7b8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, we need to slightly automate our machine, or rather run a SQL proxy on it.  To do this, expand the settings ‚ÄúConfigure management settings, disk, network and SSH keys‚Äù and in the section <b>Automation ‚Üí Start Script</b> we write: <br><br><pre><code class="bash hljs">sudo wget https://dl.google.com/cloudsql/cloud_sql_proxy.linux.amd64 sudo mv cloud_sql_proxy.linux.amd64 cloud_sql_proxy sudo chmod +x cloud_sql_proxy sudo ./cloud_sql_proxy -instances=&lt;INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME&gt;=tcp:3306 &amp;</code> </pre> <br>  <i>&lt;INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME&gt;</i> - we take from the properties of our database, this is the <i>‚ÄúName of the connection with the instance‚Äù</i> .  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/connect-compute-engine">Proxy Connection Article</a> <br><br>  Why is that?  In fact, only the last line is needed for the launch, all the rest is enough to be done once when setting up the machine.  This is an example so as not to break into an entire article in pieces. <br><br>  Next, an important point.  Go to the "Disks" tab and uncheck "Delete boot disk when deleting an instance."  Yes, we will delete our car after setting it up. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58d/267/040/58d26704014c1fc47ae3146a39499bed.png" alt="image"></div><br>  With the creation of the car finished, click "create" and wait. <br><br>  When the creation is complete, we connect via SSH to our virtual machine and configure it.  About the configuration of the machine itself under Bitrix, I will not write much, the materials are full and on Habr√© and on the Internet.  There is even a ready-made script ‚ÄúWeb environment‚Äù, but I did not use it for religious reasons.  It was easier for me to start everything with my hands than to understand someone else‚Äôs sandwich.  I will describe only what I did to run.  And without any optimization and tuning, otherwise I could be overwhelmed with comments from the optimization gurus of PHP, Zend, NGINX and others, without offense. <br><br>  To begin, update: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade</code> </pre> <br>  MySQL client: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">sudo apt-get install mysql-client</code> </pre> <br>  Apache: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">sudo apt-get install apache2</code> </pre> <br>  PHP: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">sudo apt-get install php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mysql</code> </pre> <br>  Restart Apache: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">sudo systemctl restart apache2</code> </pre> <br>  Next, we will need a Cloud SQL proxy for a ‚Äústraightforward‚Äù database connection.  We wrote the startup script when we created the machine, it works every time it starts.  Check if it works: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">mysql -u root -p --host 127.0.0.1</code> </pre> <br>  Enter the root password from the database, enjoy the line: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">mysql&gt;</code> </pre> <br>  If the first time does not work, then check the startup script of the machine and reboot it. <br><br><h3>  Maximize Bitrix </h3><br>  Normal wget download directly from the site: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">Wget https://www.1c-bitrix.ru/download/start_encode_php5.tar.gz</code> </pre> <br>  The link is provided for example on the starting version.  Next, unpack the files in the web server directory, I left the default. <br><br>  With a machine like they finished, go to the list of virtual machines on Google Cloud and open our machine via HTTP (or HTTPS, if configured): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/98d/979/0f9/98d9790f91503cb3429fb279531d64c4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  During the installation, we specify the MySQL server 127.0.0.1, the <i>root</i> login and password from our Cloud SQL database, and then go along the path we need in the wizard until the installation is completed.  When everything is ready, we can check the performance of the configuration.  What I got: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ac/d64/868/8acd64868fcd3523220ae23d9a0de5cd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I, of course, drew attention to the performance of MySQL and at first was surprised.  But, as it turned out later, this is quite adequate data, the base in reality gives out normal performance, it's just that it is still cloudy. <br><br>  Everything works, move on to the next stage. <br><br><h3>  Create a scalable group of machines and put it behind the load balancer </h3><br>  I will do it in one region, in Europe.  But to understand the service, it is still possible to spread it across regions (for example, if we have partners in Asia).  The principle of operation is similar, only you will need to create two groups in two regions and a replica of the base there. <br><br>  First you need to create a disk image.  We delete our virtual machine.  Yes, yes, we delete it.  Here it is important to remember whether we removed the checkbox ‚ÄúDelete boot disk when deleting an instance‚Äù when creating it.  If you have forgotten, then we clone (when the machine is opened, the button is on top) and remove it in the parameters.  After removing the machine, we will have its disk available for creating an image. <br><br>  Go to the section <b>Compute Engine ‚Üí Images</b> , click "create image".  When creating nothing tricky, we indicate our vacant disk and everything is ready. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/338/1d7/2f7/3381d72f7f9b246be1709dc9ac734ec7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Next, create a template for our future machines with Bitrix. <br><br>  Go to <b>Compute Engine ‚Üí Instance Templates</b> .  We create a template by analogy with our virtual machine, but already from our image. <br><br>  Specify: <br><br><ul><li>  Name </li><li>  Size (we need the size of one VM, then they will "multiply") </li><li>  Image (in the section "Custom Images" indicate the one created earlier) </li><li>  Service account (created earlier by us with ‚ÄúCloud SQL Client‚Äù rights) </li><li>  Allow traffic on configured HTTP / HTTPS protocols </li><li>  We decompose "Configuring management parameters, disk and SSH keys" and write the startup script: </li></ul><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">sudo ./cloud_sql_proxy -instances=&lt;INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME&gt;=tcp:3306 &amp;</code> </pre> <br>  Again, this script was included when creating the machine, now only the last line is enough.  The template is configured.  Remember that we take <i>&lt;INSTANCE_CONNECTION_NAME&gt;</i> from the properties of our PaaS database. <br><br>  Create a group of instances: <br><br>  Open <b>Compute Engine ‚Üí Instance Groups ‚Üí Create Instance Group</b> . <br><br>  Specify: <br><br><ul><li>  Name, </li><li>  Zone (I specified the base location zone), </li><li>  The template (which we just created), </li><li>  Enable autoscaling, </li><li>  Basis for autoscaling - balancer </li><li>  We specify the minimum and maximum number of copies as we need </li><li>  We can create a state check.  We specify the HTTP path and if the machine does not respond, then another one will be nailed and launched. </li></ul><br>  Created. <br><br><h3>  Load balancer </h3><br>  Click on the "sandwich" at the top left, <b>Network ‚Üí Load Balancing ‚Üí Create Load Balancer</b> . <br><br>  <b>HTTP / HTTPS load balancing -&gt; Start configuration</b> . <br><br>  Specify: <br><br><ul><li>  Naming, as it is convenient for us </li><li>  <b>Server VM configuration -&gt; Server services and segments -&gt; (decomposed) Server services -&gt; Create Server service</b> .  Specify the group of instances that were created.  We include the balancing mode we need (I included in the frequency of requests), indicate the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the indicators, Done.  Immediately indicate the status check of the machines that we created, or create a new one.  We can enable CDN. </li><li>  Interface interface configuration.  This will then look to the outside world from our decision.  We specify the name, the HTTP / HTTPS protocol, the address type (static of course), we load the certificate (if needed). </li></ul><br>  Done, create.  Work starts almost immediately, you can not wait. <br><br>  After creating the balancer, open the tab ‚Äúinterface VMs‚Äù and see its external address.  According to it, our Bitrix will work in the Google Cloud Platform.  Go to the address, enjoy.  We can write this address in DNS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/662/560/8b8/6625608b896b8178b6330390d56f1703.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Finally, a couple of performance and scaling tests </h3><br>  First, what we have: <br><br><ul><li>  Cloud SQL base - 1vCPU, 1,7Gb RAM </li><li>  Group of virtual machines with scaling from one to seven, each 1vCPU, 3,5Gb RAM (you can choose the optimal one for your project, I took standard machines) </li><li>  Load Balancer with one external IP address </li></ul><br>  I configured the launch of additional instances of machines first with 100 simultaneous connections to show how it works.  For combat decisions can use your own options.  Testing was conducted during the trial period of GCP with a limit on the number of cores for all machines of only eight, therefore the eighth core was taken by the machine with which the test was directly launched. <br><br>  First, we got the following test schedule: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a6c/fb9/ebe/a6cfb9ebe9383caa9d97a8a032ee41d5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It became clear that the machines do not have time to run.  Therefore, their minimum number was increased to two, the number of connections per machine was reduced to 50, and the maximum load was reduced to 80%.  The result was: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06a/360/ce4/06a360ce4b0236c409a7d39b34a3886c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In the end, everything took off, automatic scaling worked as it should. <br><br>  Of course, a lot of things can be added to our solution.  For example, server tuning under Bitrix itself, copying and replication of the base, failover, etc. This topic is already for other materials.  This article is written more likely not to show the possibility of Bitrix and other web and mobile projects on Google Cloud.  This is a simple guide to building fault-tolerant and distributed applications based on virtual machines using Google load balancer. <br><br>  To organize a distributed application, we just need to replicate the database to another region, create another group of virtual machines in another region, and turn on the machines in our global balancer.  Google itself will choose the best route and direct users to the application in the nearest location. <br><br>  A little later, another article will be published on how to run Bitrix on Google App Engine.  I think it will be more interesting. <br><br>  Finally, let's touch the cost of services: <br><br><ul><li>  In the minimum configuration - 2 VM web servers (1 vCore, 3.5 Gb RAM), 1 VM MySQL (1 vCore, 1.7 Gb RAM), load Balancer) ~ 100 $ / month </li><li>  In the maximum configuration (7 VM web server, 1 VM MySQL, load Balancer) ~ 230 $ / month </li></ul><br>  Prices are naturally approximate, for a specific combat solution may require a powerful database, the distribution by region and so on.  Everything is designed for location in a European data center without excesses. <br><br>  In addition to the modest price for impressive resources, it is also pleasing that the Google Cloud Platform has finally become available in Russia for cashless payment to organizations. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330664/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330664/</a></p>
