  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Making Money on the Online Games</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://iqseo.ru/sites/default/files/goblin.jpg" align="right"><h4>  Prehistory </h4><br>  It all started with my younger brother, who for several years in a row has been aimlessly killing his life while playing online games.  I used to bypass them, knowing that I, too, would be delayed, like Ultima Online in due time.  But, once, ‚Äúfrom idleness, getting sick,‚Äù with the next rearrangement of ATI drivers, I agreed to 10 days of the trial World of Warcraft.  So a couple of months of my life flew by unnoticed :) <br><br><h4>  First thoughts </h4><br>  But if the first month was just fun to play, then in the second month I wanted to become the coolest of all and I began to google Yandex on the topic ‚Äúhow to quickly speed up a character‚Äù.  But instead of the expected guides, the whole dozen were filled with sites that ‚Äúquickly pump your spell for loot.‚Äù  And the first thought in my head was - ‚ÄúOh, the people of the grandmother are doing here.  And I have a whole company to promote their sites.  Now I‚Äôll do my saytik, put it in the first place, put the extra person in the office, let him play, and give me an extra penny. ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a>  I called my younger brother right away, voiced the idea.  We conducted an investigative experiment and realized that despite the fact that he has been playing Warcraft for 2 years, we cannot raise more than level 40 in a day of the game.  And the 40th level for those who are in the 10-ke Yandex costs $ 50.  And the day of the game is 3 working days for 8 hours.  As a result, at 5 days we get $ 350 a month, of which we have to pay the person who plays, pay for the office, for the Internet, for the links for optimization, and all that remains is our net profit.  At such moments I get the feeling that the skis do not go. <br>  Began to look on the subject of records.  Who, what kind of records puts on fast gain levels.  One American per day was able to get the 70th level, and that‚Äôs 200-300 dollars, which is not bad, but he has 3 heads and 8 hands, and I realized that it‚Äôs impossible to find such a person in St. Petersburg.  And records of ordinary mortals are very disappointing. <br><br><h4>  So where is the money itself? </h4><br>  But then, in the process of searching, the world of bots for WOW opened up for me.  And what I saw plunged me into shock.  On the botovodov forums, I saw site owners who pump over characters and sell gold, I immediately understood everything, but I was not shocked by this.  A shock caused the scope of the community.  Recently, they celebrated a sad date, when a year ago, in a single day, the Blizzard banned 400 thousand botovodov accounts.  But it does not stop anyone.  I read forums and I understand that people who have played with bots can no longer exist without them. <br>  And now that we have, there is only one really working bot.  People pay monthly subscription fees for it.  Bot is very buggy.  With a terrible interface in which nichert is not clear. <br>  And while Habr is sleeping, the developers of this buggy software earn millions. <br>  And I would even fit in with the development of my bot, but the stupidest thing is that I have no familiar programmers and I don‚Äôt even know how much such a development can cost.  Will the budget be measured in thousands or tens of thousands of dollars.  So I decided to ask the habrasociety community for advice.
