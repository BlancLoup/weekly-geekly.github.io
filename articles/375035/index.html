  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Facebook: the secret of correspondence or preventive justice?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the US, Facebook is judged for violating the privacy of correspondence and invading privacy due to scanning messages.  At the same time, the British public blames the social network for not helping the police prevent the killing of a soldier: plans for this ‚Äúaction‚Äù were discussed on Facebook. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/81f/59a/c3c/81f59ac3cbeb3ca91308a1418494df2a.jpg" width="600"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The California District Court reports that the case of scanning messages by the social network Facebook will continue.  Although the company tried to close this case, it turned out to reject only a couple of accusations. <br><br>  There are currently three claimants alleging Facebook‚Äôs violation of various state and federal laws.  The essence of the violation is scanning users' messages for more accurate advertising targeting.  Also, users are not satisfied that the mention of companies in messages automatically turned into a "like" corresponding page.  According <a href="http://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/facebook-campbell.pdf">to the plaintiffs</a> , the message service ‚Äúdeveloped to allow users to communicate with other users privately,‚Äù therefore, working with their content violates privacy laws and privacy laws.

Therefore, the social network can not illegally intercept them.  When this position became useless, the company's lawyers began to say that scanning is a common business practice that cannot fall under the aforementioned laws.  In any case, Facebook stopped it in 2012, because the case must be stopped, the defense thought. <br><br>  The court went an unusual, ancient way: read the rules of Facebook.  And he decided: ‚Äúthe document does not establish that users agree to scan their messages for advertising purposes.  There is no mention of the term message. ‚Äù  Based on this, the user expects that his correspondence remains closed. <br><br>  Facebook has an argument: scanning is a standard, common component of messaging operations.  After all, e-mail services do not intercept messages while they are on their server - these messages should be there, otherwise nothing will work.  After this argument, the court ruled that the company did not convey enough information about the operation of its message service, so that the practice could be called ‚Äúnormal‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  Preventive justice </h4><br><blockquote>  Civil authority, considered as such, seems to be a combination of that class of natural rights, which a person is not capable of exercising independently and which are thereby useless for her, but being gathered together, they become useful to everyone.  (Thomas Payne, Human Rights) <br></blockquote><br>  The state has the power because we allow it to do so.  We give a part of our freedom and rights in order to receive social protection, protection from external aggressors, the possibility of a comfortable life.  But with the advent of the Internet, we have less and less ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù information: many contacts can easily be found in the profile on Giktayms, you can find the address and the name of a person by his car number.  You <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/242492/">can listen to</a> our telephone conversations. <br><br>  Few people want to somehow invade his privacy.  And while many use social networks and are looking for answers to questions on the Internet, <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/241916/">forgetting</a> that we are already being carried out total surveillance in order to earn more money.  Facebook even <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/90737/facebook-sohranyaet-dazhe-postyi-kotoryie-polzovatel-tak-i-ne-reshilsya-opublikovat/">keeps draft posts</a> . <br><br>  At the end of November, there was a sensation in the British media about a crime committed in the spring of 2013: British soldier Lee Rigby was killed in protest at the murder of Muslims by the British army.  In this case, the criminals left a lot of traces, and, tell Facebook information in intelligence at the right time, the murder would not have taken place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/ea2/6c3/24fea26c325078bfea77d2df2cddeac3.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  This is about preventive justice: the concept on which <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">activities</a> are <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5">carried out to prevent the commission of illegal acts by bona fide actors</a> .  A similar type serves the Latin type notary.  An interesting fact from Wikipedia: in the USA, where there is no Latin notary, the costs of legal proceedings in 1996 amounted to 2% of GDP, and in Western Europe, where there is such a notary, the cost is five times less - 0.4% of GDP. <br><br>  So the question is: are you ready to agree to scan your correspondence? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375035/</a></p>
