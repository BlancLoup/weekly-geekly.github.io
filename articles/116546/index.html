Of the tapes of several hundred thematic subscriptions, approximately 5% of the worthwhile publications are selected that are interesting to share.

      <strong><a href="http://flowingdata.com/2011/02/10/a-study-of-ipad-usage-via-fingerprints/">A study of iPad usage via fingerprints</a></strong> <br>  An unusual way to do user research on touch interfaces is by using fingerprints on the iPad screen, left when working with the application.  In fact, this is an analogue of heat maps, transferred to the physical world. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/design/ux-ideas-in-the-cards">UX Ideas in the Cards</a></strong> <br>  An overview of specialized sets of playing cards that can be used in design work ‚Äî for example, design methods or game mechanics.

With the development of modern interfaces, the issue of specifying such dynamic effects has become particularly acute - traditional wireframes will not help much here. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/01/developing-your-interviewing-skills-part-i-preparing-for-an-interview.php">Developing Your Interviewing Skills</a></strong> <br>  A series of articles by Mia Northrop, in which she shares her experience in conducting interviews with users and customer representatives.

Such a matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa two-dimensional plane that compares different approaches to design according to two characteristics. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.allaboutux.org/">All About UX</a></strong> <br>  Knowledge base dedicated to design methods and approaches.  The selection is rather impressive, although not all articles are ready yet. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2011/01/20/aristotle%25E2%2580%2599s-storytelling-framework-for-interactive-products/">Aristotle's Storytelling Framework for Interactive Products</a></strong> <br>  Jeroen van Geel talks about an unusual method of using the principles of storytelling in the design.  The article compares the interface with the plot of the film in order to work with the product was just as exciting. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.userfocus.co.uk/articles/uxvision.html">Why do you need to create and publicize it?</a></strong> <br>  The article is devoted to the vision of the future product - this is an important part of the design process, which should clearly and visually convey the basic essence.

The article tells how to take into account the peculiarities of their behavior and perception, and also gives recommendations for designers and designers. <br><br><h3>  Instruments </h3><br>  <strong><a href="http://openexhibits.org/gesturelibrary">Open Source Gesture Library and Gesture Illustrations</a></strong> <br>  An extensive collection of multi-touch gestures that can be used in wireframes.  Icons are available in vector and raster formats. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.userfocus.co.uk/resources/prototype.html">Paper Prototyping Helper Kit</a></strong> <br>  An excellent set of elements for paper design from the company UserFocus.  <a href="http://www.userfocus.co.uk/pdf/paper_prototyping_elements.pdf">Direct link to PDF</a> . <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.volkside.com/2010/12/introducing-wirify-the-web-as-wireframes/">Introducing Wirify - The web as wireframes</a></strong> <br>  Unusual and extremely useful bookmarklet that allows you to show any site in the form of wireframe.  This is a great way to compare your experience on the interface with the products of competitors, as well as use them in discussions with the client. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://jasonfurnell.wordpress.com/2010/12/02/business-model-canvas-facilitator-cards/">Business Model Canvas - Facilitator Cards</a></strong> <br>  A set of playing cards for working groups to develop business models.

Restrictions relate to both technical and political aspects of the issue. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/design-diversity-process.html">Parallel &amp; Iterative Design + Competitive Testing = High Usability</a></strong> <br>  Jakob Nielsen talks about a series of usability studies that measure the effectiveness and quality of the final interface for different project management processes.  The parallel creation of several versions of pages with their subsequent testing and selection of the best one had the greatest effect. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.designing-media.com/">Designing Media (Bill Moggridge Book)</a></strong> <br>  The Bill Moggridge book is about the design of classic and online media, which includes a series of interviews with leading designers of the NY Times, Twitter and other companies.

The authors mainly describe the game menus and describe the weak points of the first decisions.  A similar study was <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/kinect-gesture-ux.html">conducted in the Nielsen-Norman Group</a> . <br><br><h2>  Theory </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/01/the-power-of-comparison-how-it-affects-decision-making.php">The Power of Comparison - How It Affects Decision Making</a></strong> <br>  Colleen Roller describes the effect that comparison has on human decisions.  In addition, she talks about how you can apply these features in the design.  Her second article continues the topic and describes the <a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2011/02/the-nature-of-choice-sets-and-their-affect-on-decision-making.php">comparison of option sets</a> .

Extremely interesting and informative material. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/learning-recall.html">Test-Taking Enhances Learning</a></strong> <br>  Jakob Nielsen describes research results that prove the effectiveness of tests as an effective way of learning.  The article proposes ways to use this approach in interfaces in order for users to better remember important information. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.measuringusability.com/blog/top-2010.php">Top 10 Research-Based Usability Findings of 2010</a></strong> <br>  Jeff Sauro has published a list of the findings of various usability studies of 2010.
