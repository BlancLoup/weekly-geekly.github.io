But today we can say the same about all other devices (including laptops) - after all, as you know, at the beginning of the year Intel introduced many new processors from the Core family. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eae/898/535/eae89853581af23cfebd232707acf83a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I managed to get one of these laptops ... well, then you know. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, the name of the model involuntarily causes some associations - yes, yes, with the legendary Ka-52 <b>Alligator</b> helicopter.  But that's where all the similarities end.  The five in the model name signals us about the diagonal of the screen (15 inches, respectively), and the two - just indicates that we are facing a second-generation model.

The novelty is complemented by a fairly productive stuffing - a discrete <b>ATI HD5470</b> video card with a gigabyte of memory, 4 gigabytes of RAM and another 500 on the hard disk.  Interesting?  Still would! <br><br>  <a href="http://asusnb.ru/cgi-bin/catalog.pl%3Foption%3DFullModelInfo%26id%3D234"><b>Full Specs</b></a> <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Appearance </h2><br>  Since this laptop is a logical continuation of the K-series, there is nothing surprising in the fact that the design is almost entirely inherited from the pioneers.  However, there are minor differences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d8a/df3/5ed/d8adf35ed6b201e92bb7108a40009b5e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For example, now, opening a laptop, the user can put his hands on a nice rough (textured) surface, and not on the "lacquered piano."  It seems that the manufacturer really understood that the matte surface is more practical - I hope it will continue to be used in more and more devices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e47/e91/438/e47e914383bec5e8c11e1bd97b3d95e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e47/519/9bd/e475199bdc73c8773e81184ec1392979.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e5b/36d/96e/e5b36d96e45378c2bcb06092eb71fabf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the sides there is almost everything you need - 3xUSB, HDMI, D-Sub, card reader, two audio connectors, a gigabit RJ-45 port and a drive for disks (DVD). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ea/09f/c6f/5ea09fc6fb9e060f8f28f27d3d5191be.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9b4/e44/4dd/9b4e444dda3c02740eb9fafcbf0f4aa5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/93c/dd0/7d2/93cdd07d2927077bb2659a2d477e8460.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d9e/600/99a/d9e60099a085d34ffa62050c1b6e5d21.png" alt="image">  The screen has a diagonal of 15.6 inches, while the staff resolution is 1366x768 (16: 9).  LED lights, all things - the picture is really good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca6/876/6f3/ca68766f3633f233fd42f97d967f0b03.png" alt="image">  The keyboard is full, with a digital unit.  The buttons are large, with rounded corners, separated by small gaps.  The layout is standard, although with such a large number of keys sometimes the second Fn button was missing (to the right of the space).  The key travel is small and they do not click when typing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f66/0f9/d27/f660f9d272231835f45588d3d6c91524.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/736/a50/60f/736a5060f3d3eb8384d4559c63a10756.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c55/982/5b9/c559825b943055ea24111ea15195b956.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The touchpad is made in the form of a small rectangular recess in the part of the case under the keyboard - this solution will not allow dust to accumulate (there are no corners or dissimilar materials), and, at the same time, will contribute to the "blind tactile" search.  As elsewhere, under it is a large combined chrome button and several LEDs (they are already on the front panel). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d95/92c/99e/d9592c99ef78518e3e162bce37242129.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/213/17d/246/21317d24660410cef95dbbf4b8db7670.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The weight of the device is 2.6 kg with a battery, and with a charger - all 3. The dimensions of the laptop are 380x255x34.5-35.7 mm. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8fa/170/f3d/8fa170f3d6592461ce50add2e7cc52f0.png" alt="image">  Performance </h2><br>  Immediately after switching on, on the front of the netbook (under the touchpad), several status LEDs light up.  Noise from work is almost unheard of - the device works really quietly. <br><br>  Due to the fact that Hyper Threading is working on both cores of the dual-core Core i5, the processor is capable of processing up to 4 threads simultaneously - only recently it was available only on processors like Core 2 Quad.  Apparently, this is due to the high performance of the processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f99/468/b41/f99468b41b97915b7ace7141b45b1c00.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Judge for yourself - in the arithmetic test <a href="">Super Pi</a> , the number Pi is up to a million on a K52Jr laptop counted in <b>17.815</b> seconds.  While the fashion laptop <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/asus/blog/70632/">ASUS VX5 Lamborghini</a></b> (just on the Core 2 Quad) does the same in <b>22.324</b> seconds!  And this is despite the fact that K52 is three times cheaper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ff/271/eac/5ff271eac31d8292accd1cfdacbda14c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  An interesting point in this model is the <b>ATI Mobility Radeon HD5470</b> discrete graphics card with 1GB DDR3 and support for DirectX11.  More precisely, it‚Äôs interesting not so much the presence of the card itself as the ability to switch from the integrated (into the processor!) <b>Intel HD Graphics</b> video system to the discrete one - depending on the needs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfa/8cd/5be/bfa8cd5beaa76e55d4781b78603e3ec8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For example, working from the network, you can not save the battery and "squeeze" to the full, while on the road it may well be enough and embedded video.  This technology is called <b>Intel Switchable Graphics</b> and definitely has the right to life.  For comparison, in the synthetic test 3D Mark 2006, integrated vidyuha gains 1350 parrots, while the discrete - 4180. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/40b/31e/64e/40b31e64e7fd6c116994bb1df07f88b6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside there is a 500GB hard disk installed, the speed characteristics of which are as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/880/7b6/f4d/8807b6f4d00f3b51c8ca42fa292ab26a.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/39a/4e5/c88/39a4e5c88b1921f8e9363f21d6ea373d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The laptop initially installed the initial version of Windows 7, the image of which, just in case, is recorded on a hidden disk partition (you can get a fully working Axis from which you can be in 15 minutes).  The performance index is decent 5.1 (out of 7.9), and the video card is the weak point (the hard disk is behind it). <br><br>  If we talk from a consumer point of view, then the laptop is enough for full-fledged work - starting with the messing around with text and Internet content, ending with editors such as Photoshop.  No problem went HD-movies, up to 1080p (while the processor will be only about 10%).  You can also play - in many modern games ... but, of course, not at the maximum settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2ae/267/009/2ae2670099e1ee4ae8a2f66a5b832578.png" alt="image">  The battery life is about 3-3.5 hours. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af2/94a/228/af294a2281f2c106ec7aac2f877a8602.png" alt="image">  Check weighing </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Stylish matte (inside) case; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Comfortable keyboard and touchpad; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  High performance; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/881/117/ccb/881117ccbc836c685868fb19a2bf46c1.png" alt="+">  Availability of drive and HDMI-connector; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  Glossy cover (though almost no brand) and screen frame (brand); <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  There was no ExpressGate technology; <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/24f/0ae/920/24f0ae920b085ead2e6d649649177122.png" alt="-">  High enough price. <br><br>  About the second minus, perhaps some do not know what they mean.  And we are talking about the wonderful <b>ASUS ExpressGate</b> technology, which is a small operating system that runs on laptops in 7-8 seconds after launch.  It has many functions - a file manager, a player, full Skype and Firefox, an IM client for several protocols (including ICQ and GTalk) - it was strange not to see this chip on the new device. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cc7/eb7/275/cc7eb72751786cfc4fa8252f390bd319.png" alt="image">  There are two versions of the model of <b>ASUS K52Jr</b> laptop - with a <b>Core i3 350M processor</b> and with a <b>Core i5 430M processor</b> .  The second one, of course, is more interesting - it was about him that was discussed in this article.  But the price for it starts from a mark of 29 thousand rubles, while asking for a ‚Äúyounger‚Äù version from 26. It‚Äôs not the most anti-crisis proposal, but it seems to me more than competitive.  On the other hand, new items, yes, on the new platform, have never been cheap. <br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af9/2a7/40a/af92a740a6d88eb7bf72752fca2cf022.png" alt="image">  The end </h2><br>  New processors from Intel are definitely good - productive, thought out, compact and with a moderate ‚Äúappetite.‚Äù  At least, I managed to verify this with the example of another laptop, and perhaps I am even glad that there will be only more of them.  It is also very nice to see that ASUS is able to do work on the bugs - a stylish matte body in the continuation of the series is proof of that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a36/eda/386/a36eda38660300d6b8f4697842eb1373.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The review notebook is a good example of how a laptop should be.  Convenient, practical, with all the necessary interfaces - exactly what many may need for everyday computer activities.  The only thing left of the sediment is a fairly high price, comparable to equally attractive devices from the UL-series.  Although for some reason I always thought that ASUS‚Äôs ‚ÄúK‚Äù series is a budget one. <br><br>  Sorry about the helicopter so little.  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87059/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87059/</a></p>
