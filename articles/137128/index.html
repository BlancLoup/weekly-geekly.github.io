  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Medicine + IT: what can you do with the data</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Dr. Kraft is a person who talks about the future of medicine in relation to IT.  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/digitaloctober/blog/136252/">past topic</a> was his interview for Habr and a couple of announcements, this is the report on the results of the lecture in Russia. <br><br>  One of the main topics of the lecture was an exponential increase in the rate of technical progress: now there are already many times more data and opportunities than we can handle.  We need people and companies that understand how all this can be used.  Dr. Kraft, in fact, says that the area is completely open to new projects and ideas.  Mobile medicine is here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/693/da9/274/693da92743ce2b81b882e9650ac192b5.jpg">

    <blockquote>  <b>In whatever field you work, be it computer science or game creation or data processing, statistics, robotics, I urge you to think about how to apply your skills in these areas to the world of health and medicine.</b> </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  The main paradigms of technology development </h4><ul><li>  <b>Faster</b> : all medical processes accelerate.  For example, an ECG can be taken at home simply by attaching an iPhone with a sensor and transferring the data to a doctor in a matter of seconds. </li><li>  <b>Less</b> : Devices that diagnose and monitor, decrease in size. </li><li>  <b>Cheaper</b> : the more accurate the tests, the less they need to be done.  The sooner you can catch signs of the disease, the less money will be spent on its treatment.  In essence, medicine will become largely preventive (this trend has been observed since the beginning of the last century). </li><li>  More <b>qualitative</b> : the cheaper and faster everything becomes, the more opportunities there are to implement personalized medicine based on the human genocode. </li></ul><br><h4>  Modern problems </h4><ul><li>  The high cost of health care (medicine can be many times cheaper) </li><li>  Low access to medical care (it should be faster and already in place) </li><li>  The difference of medical approaches. </li><li>  Ineffective use of patient information. </li><li>  Fragmentation among the doctors themselves: often do not communicate with each other </li><li>  In the United States, all possible tests are done in order to avoid legal problems (and this reduces efficiency). </li><li>  Any forward movement is limited by regulatory frameworks and a lack of funds. </li><li>  The structure of the health care system is confusing and ill-conceived. </li></ul><br>  Dr. Kraft believes that modern healthcare is wasteful and inefficient: <br><blockquote>  <b>We spend huge amounts of money (up to 80% of health care funds) on the treatment of chronic diseases, such as diabetes or heart disease.</b>  <b>Using new technologies we will be able to send more money to prevent the emergence of diseases.</b> </blockquote><br><br>  To solve such problems, a University of Singularity was created - a place where new integrative technologies are considered to solve global problems, for example, poverty, pandemics, lack of energy or pollution, and so on.  Specific projects emerge from the university‚Äôs mission, here are a couple of examples: <br><ul><li>  MATTERNET - deliver vaccines to remote areas using remote-controlled aircraft / robots. </li><li>  Getaround - ‚Äúthe future of shared transport‚Äù - share your car. </li></ul><br><h4>  Mobile technology for medicine </h4><br>  Today more than 20 thousand mobile applications are available for download.  They help determine whether the drugs are falsified, keep a diet, remind you about taking medications, and so on.  Even more interesting is how mobile devices and medical equipment are integrated.  An example is a blood glucose meter that connects to an iPhone for the sake of a screen, for logging and sending data to doctors. <br><br>  Dr. Kraft calls this the era of mobile health.  The major players in the technology world (for example, Bill Gates and Aneesh Chopra) are already interested in the development of the sphere.  Medicine is distributed outside hospitals in order to become more mobile (Health Summit). <br><ul><li>  Today, there is already a digital stethoscope - a $ 10 iPhone case and a free app make it possible to conduct an ECG using a phone.  Modifications for the camera phone allow you to examine the ear and send this data to doctors or to conduct an ophthalmological study and even make a recommendation for glasses. </li><li>  More and more patients are using online methods: these are consultations via a video channel, and sending data from their medical devices. </li><li>  New technologies are based on computer power, and the more powerful, faster and smarter computers become, the more opportunities appear for analyzing and visualizing situations.  Using MRI images and molecular imaging, you can combine data to create three-dimensional reconstructions of problem areas and a better understanding of these problems. </li></ul><br>  <b>Quantitative example</b> : complete reconstruction of the brain took 2 weeks 2 years ago, now it is 4-5 days.  <b>Qualitative example</b> : it is possible to carry out reconstruction under the patient, and on the basis of the model to practice the operation. <br><br>  Daniel has been a military medical pilot for a long time and says that ‚Äúwe learn from the world of flights‚Äù - we simulate processes just as we simulated flights.  This gives us the opportunity to practice in situations that occur only occasionally, for example, once in a thousand operations. <br><br>  True, today there are more urgent problems: 70% of all medical documentation still exists on paper: the banal digitization of known data will make it possible to quickly and fully access them from anywhere on the planet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c65/56c/e93/c6556ce93d49227effad27a3bc1f1a07.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare </h4><br>  An AI for medicine is an opportunity to systematize a multitude of data and predict a situation with a patient.  At the recent CES 2012 exhibition, X Prize and Quallcomm presented the doctor‚Äôs artificial intelligence integrated into a mobile device.  It is clear that when Kraft talks about AI, he means complex expert programs, but the benefits of them are already obvious - as is the potential. <br><br><h4>  Gaming technology in medicine </h4><br>  Microsoft Kinect is already being used for healthcare, for example for recognizing signs of a stroke or for physiotherapy.  It is worth adding that doctors and the military are always interested in convenient interfaces: natural and fast access to data, intuitive control, accuracy and other advantages always mean saved time, and, therefore, saved lives. <br><br>  Monitoring your sleep (Lark) and your health (Fitbit) already exist.  There are ribbed brushes that allow you to collect statistics on how often you brush your teeth.  They can be used to keep track of how often your children brush their teeth. <br><blockquote>  <b>It's not about the data, but what you do with it.</b> </blockquote><br>  Another example: before, one scan occupied 50 Mb, now the data is already 20 Gb, and very soon it will be 1 Tb.  Proper use of this data allows you to replace invasive methods with non-invasive procedures: virtual colonoscopy using CT scans (instead of swallowing the probe using external sensors), virtual angiogram - non-invasive imaging of the heart muscle and designing to look for anomalies and testing possible treatments (HeartFlow, Stanford) . <br><br>  In the future, health monitoring will be implemented through practically everything: clothes, watches and even tattoos with indication of infections.  The question is in the collection and processing of data.  Information can be used both to prevent critical cases in resuscitation and for such household things as diapers, which send you an SMS about the fact that they should be changed. <br><br>  Augmented reality will be able to show you how you will look if you stay on a diet or if you do not stop smoking. <br><br><h4>  Devices are reduced in size </h4><ul><li>  The accelerometer once cost $ 100,000, and now there is in every phone. </li><li>  The camera is inserted into a capsule and can be swallowed. </li><li>  Pacemakers can now be programmed from a mobile phone. </li><li>  Laboratory for the analysis of blood connected to the phone. </li></ul><br>  There is a good example from the military industry - a wounded soldier was diagnosed on time and operated on by the robot right on the battlefield. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/de8/09d/efd/de809defdb0937ecf9b0e7c31c6238a3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  The era of medicine 4P </h4><ul><li>  Predictive - guessing problems before they appear. </li><li>  Preventive - elimination of problems prior to their treatment. </li><li>  Personalized - individual medicine. </li><li>  Participatory - effective participation in the process of diagnosing and treating all the necessary people. </li></ul><br>  Social networks in medicine and game mechanics will help more effectively involve patients in the struggle for health. <br><br><h4>  Medicine will become exponentially better </h4><br>  Personalized drugs are planned - a cocktail of drugs based on individual parameters of the genotype to increase the effectiveness of treatment.  Research on the use of stem cells will soon make it possible to ‚Äúreprogram‚Äù any cell in the body into a stem cell, which means the appearance of ‚Äúrejuvenating apples‚Äù.  3D-printing of organs and tissues will provide an opportunity to solve many medical problems.  Remote examination of patients will save them from having to go to the hospital.  Medicine will be available in remote regions and where there is no qualified personnel. <br><br>  Summarizing, Dr. Kraft noted that our tasks are to seek convergence (combination of technologies), use data and link patterns, plan with allowance for exponential growth.  Daniel believes that now begins the time when competent information processing becomes the most important part of medicine: this is a direct intersection with IT.  As he said in a past interview, the doctor of the future is a programmer who can sew up a wound in a field. <br><br><h4>  Briefly about the event </h4><br>  The project Knowledgestream.ru was created in order to provide a direct flow of knowledge about modern technologies for business.  Several times a month, similar events are held at the Digital October site, where you can greet a picture of a lecturer, listen to his report, and then ask any questions. <br><br>  This lecture was the first to use 3D holographic telepresence technology (for more details, please refer to musion.co.uk, a high definition 3D holographic video).  You can see the most vivid examples <a href="http://knowledgestream.ru/event-09.html">in the second segment of the video lecture</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a37/171/a21/a37171a21a9fa6da63d27a62233f1f02.jpg"><br><br>  Next month more lectures are expected: they can be found <a href="http://knowledgestream.ru/">here</a> or in the ‚ÄúEvents‚Äù of Habr. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137128/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137128/</a></p>
