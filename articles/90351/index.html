He undoubtedly has a lot of advantages: <br>  + everything I need - you can always find <br>  + Single records are not lost. <br>  + Having developed certain notation, I was able to structure the records, mark the priority of the tasks, indicate the type of the record, and so on. <br>  But, again, for me they became a minus: <br>  -It is impossible to decompose everything in sections. <br>  Dimensions of the diary that satisfied my needs, left much to be desired - with a small book.  No mobility - to take a diary - you need to take a briefcase with you. <br>  - every time you need to write something down - you need to pull the diary out of the briefcase.  Plus, every time you have to burn a laptop (alas, oh, I don't live in the best area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe city) <br><br>  Once again, being angry with myself and my diary, I decided to look for a solution not on stationery, but on the Internet, because I‚Äôm not the only one.  And found the same. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So, I present to your attention Hipster PDA.  Not to be confused with new-minded hipsters, the device has nothing to do with them.  Hipster - back pocket of pants, PDA = Parietal Disgorgement Aid - (literally) cure for vomiting of parietal lobes of the brain, well, or more civilized - a means against brain overflow.  Hipster PDA was poppularized by Merlin Mann, unfortunately I did not find out who invented it <br><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_GnNy1V3A5D4/S7yuYiO2CQI/AAAAAAAAATo/oTJ-FZmMyiM/s512/P4075778.JPG"><br>  Hipster is a DIY device, you create what you need and how.  All that is necessary for its manufacture is a set of templates of various forms, a small pile of A4 sheets, colored cardboard for dividers, a stationery clip, and optionally a plastic folder for the cover.  Although, all you need is sheets a4 and your imagination, because you yourself form what you need <br><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_GnNy1V3A5D4/S7yuUM-iKJI/AAAAAAAAATs/0rygz0Hz90g/s912/P4075771.JPG"><br>  The principle of operation is based on the principle of GTD, described in the book by David Allen "How to do everything / Getting Things Done, GTD": <br><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_GnNy1V3A5D4/S7y8nqPP_hI/AAAAAAAAATc/RnPdumsna8I/s512/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BD%D0%BE%D1%8D%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%8F%20%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%81%D1%8C%2007.04.2010%20230852.jpg"><br>  (I apologize, I didn‚Äôt find any good ones in Russian, I post the original. In principle, everything is clear) <br>  I used 4Up-Version (A4 sheet is divided into 4 sheets).  Page size - 71x119 mm - almost with a wallet. <br>  For my hipster, I formed the following sections: <br><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_GnNy1V3A5D4/S7yuXMgnNcI/AAAAAAAAATg/ni_jheDBryM/s512/P4075775.JPG"><br>  1) return information cover, GTD principle instruction <br>  2) (the first silver separator) - current affairs.  Todo lists, plans for the current day, week, month, year <br>  3) (second silver divider) - planning for the next day, week, month, clean forms of the day, week, month <br>  4) (red separator) - finance: cost and income accounting <br>  5) (yellow separator) - clean todo lists <br>  6) (orange separator) - projects, project ideas, potential projects <br>  7) (blue separator) - warehouse: useful information, thoughts, ideas <br>  8) (gold separator) - blank sheets for records <br>  9) (blue divider) - basket <br>  In my case, there was no special logic in the choice of colors, but I recommend sticking to the scheme: <b>red</b> for unassembled, <b>green</b> for Next Actions (‚ÄúGo!‚Äù), <b>Blue</b> for waiting for (Frozen), <b>yellow for</b> sometime ". <br>  The only drawback of the described design is the possibility of leaflets spilling out with the clip open.  For two weeks of use - this has never happened to me. <br><br>  Useful links on the topic: <br>  <a href="http://www.43folders.com/2004/09/03/introducing-the-hipster-pda">The official Hipster PDA website</a> - there is still a lot of useful information on it.  Principles of work organization and so on. <br>  <a href="http://www.diyplanner.com/templates/official/hpda">Information on Hipster PDA, open templates for various forms</a> - also a lot of useful <br>  <a href="http://www.lifehacks.land.ru/hipsterpda.htm">For those who are too lazy to read in English</a> - in fact I myself discovered Hipster from this very page. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90351/</a></p>
