Interview with Linda Liukas (Linda Liukas)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The start of the 12th Moscow Rails Club is very soon - only 11 days are left!  By the way, we recommend not to postpone the <a href="http://railsclub.timepad.ru/event/76008/%3Futm_refcode%3D95c73ccecc305e313977a72d1c6f02260353ae99">purchase of tickets</a> .  Tickets for 8 000 rubles still in stock, but their number is limited. <br><br>  Relentlessly continue to tell you about the guests.  We have already met <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/railsclub/blog/191888/">Ernie Miller</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/railsclub/blog/193172/">Eric Hodl</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/railsclub/blog/192552/">Jeremy Evans</a> . <br><br>  Now it's time to learn more about, perhaps, the most charming of the conference guests - Linde Liukas.  The owner of the Ruby Hero Award 2013, author of the book ‚ÄúHello Ruby‚Äù and an activist of RailsGirls agreed to answer some of our traditional questions.

      Interviews are published with original answers in English and our free translation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c9/1f8/40a/5c91f840abec3cf5bee2a888d0e66288.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>When and why did you start programming?</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I was 13 and I was literally in love with the then Vice-President of the United States, Al Gore (sometime in 2001).  In those days, neither Tumblr, Twitter, nor Facebook were yet available, so learning HTML and CSS was for me, a teenage girl, the only possible realization of my hyperactivity.  Ten years later, I happened to take part in the Ruby on Rails weekend workshop, and I again experienced the same emotions! <br><br>  I was 13 years old, and then vice president of the United States (somewhere in 2001!).  It was the girlfriend of the teenage girl excitement.  Some ten years later, it was a rush of excitement. <br><br>  <b>What are you working on right now?</b> <br><br>  I am working on a children's book on the basics of programming: it deals with such basic things as cycles, sequences, variables and functions, as well as such principles as open-source culture and object-oriented programming.  All this is told from the face of a little girl (whose name is Ruby!) And her friends (among them are the lonely Snow Leopard, clever penguins and little stupid robots).  Perhaps this is what now fascinates me the most. <br><br>  It is a concept that it can be used as a guideline.  Shepherd (who is called a ruby!) And her friends (she is a girl who is called Ruby!).  This is the project I'm probably the most excited about. <br><br>  <b>What is the best and worst part of your job?</b> <br><br>  I have to work with developers from all over the world.  For a native of a small country it is a great honor to work with people who are really passionate about their special craft and have gained recognition at the world level. <br><br>  The worst thing is that there is still too much to be done, and I would like to have a little more time to focus on certain aspects of my work and develop in them. <br><br>  I like working around the world.  It is a privilege to get it. <br><br>  It‚Äôs a little bit different. <br><br>  <b>What do you consider your main achievement in life / career at the moment?</b> <br><br>  The fact that I found the strength to get off the usual career ladder.  At school I had a master‚Äôs degree in business, but soon my hobby became more important to me - from a professional point of view.  It was scary to take on startups and software development (and never bring it to mind), but it was worth it.  I would like to hope that the most important discoveries are still ahead of me, but often I don‚Äôt need much to be happy - balloons, kids and rabbits. <br><br>  Stepping out of the traditional career ladder.  I was a ‚Äúbusiness major‚Äù in school, but my hobbies ended up being much more important for my career.  It was scary, but it was definitely worth it.  But I tend to get really excited about it. <br><br>  <b>What is the purpose of your career and professional development?</b> <br><br>  I admire people who never stop at what has been accomplished, who are constantly improving and uniting various worlds (as well as creating their own).  My role models are Tove Jansson (the author of a children's Moomin book) and Army Ratia (founder of Marimekko). <br><br>  I admire people who don‚Äôt want to stay, but they reinvent themselves.  I usually mention Tove Jansson (a finnish children's book author Moomins), Armi Ratia (founder of Marimekko) as my personal idols. <br><br>  <b>What helps a programmer to grow professionally?</b> <br><br>  I cannot say that I am a professional programmer, but I believe that I owe all my skill to my sympathetic colleagues, who gave very lively and sincere feedback.  The ability to give and receive feedback is very evolving.  I also think that it is very important to periodically stop and analyze what you are doing.  I try to keep a diary of my achievements in order to be able to detail my professional growth and not engage in useless work. <br><br>  I‚Äôm not a very professional programmer, but I‚Äôm very interested in feedback.  Makes me feel better.  It is important to take a step back and reflect what you‚Äôre doing every so often.  I try to keep myself accountable to the workplace. <br><br>  <b>What book would you recommend to read to any programmer?</b> <br><br>  I love interesting quotes (and I follow too many literary Tumblrs).  Here is one of the favorites, owned by Ira Glass <br><br>  I love quotes (and follow too many literature Tumblrs!).  One of my favorites is from Ira Glass: <br><br>  ‚ÄúNobody says this to newcomers, but I would like it to be told to me in due time.  Anyone who is engaged in creative work, does it because he has good taste.  But there is one nuance.  The first few years you do not get very.  Almost ‚Äúgood,‚Äù your work has potential, but they cannot be called good.  The matter is in taste, your good taste influences what you do and bothers you.  Good taste is the reason why the fruits of your labor do not make you happy.  A lot of people leave, and not having managed to survive this phase. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNobody tells me what I‚Äôm talking about.  We have good work.  But there is this gap.  For the first couple of years you just made it.  It is potential, but it is not.  But your taste is still a killer.  And your taste is why your work disappoints you.  A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. <br><br>  Most of the people who are known to me for their interesting and creative works, for years went to this.  We understand that in our work there is no inspiration that we would like to see in it.  We all went through it. <br><br>  Most people I know who‚Äôs interesting, creative work.  We want it.  We all go through this. <br><br>  And if you are only at the beginning of the journey, it is important for you to know that this is normal, and the only thing you can do is just to work a lot.  Every week, set a new goal for yourself and manage to accomplish it on time.  Only by working tirelessly will you be able to get rid of this shortcoming and get results that will correspond to your ambitions.  In order to realize this, it took me much more time than anyone.  You just have to wait a bit.  This is normal.  Get ready to make your way upstairs! ‚Äù <br><br>  If you‚Äôre still a lot of work.  Put yourself on a deadline so that you can finish one story.  It is not a problem.  And I never met.  It's gonna take awhile.  It's normal to take awhile.  You've just gotta fight your way through. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>What do you like to do when you don't write code?</b> <br><br>  I rarely do coding during work hours, so coding is just what I enjoy in my spare time.  I also love to cook for big companies and have culinary parties.  I also like to design something and I dream to learn Japanese one day. <br><br>  I get it so I am doing it.  I also love cooking for large crowds and hosting dinner parties.  I like japanese. <br><br>  <b>Thanks for the interview and see you in Moscow!</b> <br><br><h5>  The conference </h5><br>  We invite everyone to the RailsClub'Moscow 2013 conference. Traditionally, we will feed, give presents, hold contests and lotteries, play good music :) There will be a lot of interesting and informative. <br><br>  <a href="http://railsclub.timepad.ru/event/76008/%3Futm_refcode%3D95c73ccecc305e313977a72d1c6f02260353ae99">Registration and payment of participation in the conference</a> <br><br>  Hurry up!
