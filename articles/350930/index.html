    <h3>  1. ‚ÄúThis is unprofessional ... </h3><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ... it was done by some armless students.  Yes, I myself draw it in five minutes.  Hire already normal experts.  Your level does not reach this project, ‚Äùread Lenya da Vinci in his medieval mail message to the boss. <br><br>  Well, the truth is, I constantly observe how the strongest people in the industry are scratching their turnips, having received complaints about the curvature of a young teenager who just came to work.  Somehow the fate was such that she was the boss, and they, therefore, were in the position of idiots dreaming about ... Where are the kittens drowned there? <br><br>  <b>How to:</b> <br><br>  Before proceeding to insults, at least ask about the status and biography of the performers.  And you better do without it and immediately announce what you don‚Äôt really like. <br><br><h3>  2. ‚ÄúMy experience suggests that there is no soul in this text ... </h3><br>  ... it is exactly the same as most companies, faceless and does not cause sympathy.  I need five theses that are cult, and you sent me five phrases that can be found in any blog for training and self-improvement. ‚Äù <br><br>  One warrant officer with extensive experience was beaten by benches in the canteen when the lights suddenly went out.  When the lights came on, all the soldiers were at one end of the canteen, and the benches with the leader were at the other end.  Whom to punish, it is not clear. <br><br>  <b>How to:</b> <br><br>  Do not be like an ensign, avoid in criticizing common words.  Let's get closer to what exactly does not like! <br><br><h3>  3. ‚ÄúUsers will not understand </h3><br>  ... customers will not like it, partners will not appreciate it, my chuyka, eldest daughter, wife and grandmother will not approve ‚Äù <br><br>  Yes, burn them in hell, your damned relatives!  It‚Äôs already impossible to plug another damn button somewhere on this screen in a mobile application! <br><br>  <b>How to:</b> <br><br>  In order not to substitute all of your family, and so that people around you would not dream of tearing off your chuiku, you must first test the application on real users, and not invent something for them.  And yes, do not forget to talk only about what specifically does not suit. <br><br><h3>  4. ‚ÄúIndecent Design ... </h3><br>  ... it only causes laughter and malice ‚Äù <br><br>  Of course, after such a feedback the designer will not be able to overcome the irresistible desire to show you 10 more ‚Äúdecent‚Äù options.  Or maybe he immediately rushes to look for the most competent replacement for himself, will provide a choice of 20 candidates who will perform competitive works, and then leave without severance pay? <br><br>  Okay, stop dreaming!  Speaking of dreams.  One of my friends artdir watches only BDSM-porn, because there, in his opinion, ‚Äúthey at least squeal for real‚Äù.  Comrade often represents some of their leaders instead of porn actors. <br><br>  <b>How to:</b> <br><br>  Use as few adjectives as possible regarding the project and the identity of the author - this, shall we say, distracts from work.  And yes, when will it be about what specifically does not suit? <br><br><h3>  5. ‚ÄúAnd if we paid you like this, how do you work?‚Äù </h3><br>  Well, how can it be without hints that you are ready, if anything, to throw a specialist with payment?  Of course, the subordinate will immediately change his mind and correct!  Of course, for the sake of several minimum wages, everyone is willing to endure your cries and insane claims.  After all, everything in the world for the sake of money! <br><br>  Not really.  After such threats, you can easily get reciprocal curtsies in the spirit of dismissal by the whole department. <br><br>  <b>How to:</b> <br><br>  Well, tell me, finally, what exactly does not suit you!  And if you can not say, then admit: "Something does not suit me, but I can not articulate it."  And they will help you! <br><br><h3>  And now step by step instructions on how to give feedback: </h3><br>  1. Tadam!  Did you get some feces instead of work? <br>  2. Start by studying the TK - maybe it was exactly what you ordered? <br>  3. No TK?  Then read my article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315046/">"Without TK</a> . <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315046/">"</a> <br>  4. If you have a TK, then refer to it, so that everything is strictly in the case, as agreed. <br>  5. TK - crooked?  So explain it!  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/320476/">"TZ High Definition"</a> to help you. <br>  6. With proper perseverance and a sufficient number of iterations, you will sooner or later get what was ordered in the TK.  One eye is worth looking <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/340052/">"not according to TK"</a> <br>  7. According to experience, it is cold-blooded perseverance and clarity of requirements that iron leads to success.  Screams, threats, insults, theatrical sneers at mistakes only distract everyone, for this you can see: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/327126/">‚ÄúHow to get rid of smart employees in your company‚Äù</a> <br><br>  * If you like Agile, then instead of TK there should be a card on the Agile Board where the micro task should be briefly described, preferably with a check sheet!  Experienced fighters know that one does not interfere with one another: it is possible to cut TK into cards.  At the same time, the cards themselves need to be sculpted not as horrible, but in the general structure of a large TZ. <br><br><h3>  Life hacking: </h3><br>  1. Tell us what you specifically dislike, or even better send a list of what needs to be done. <br>  2. But do not tell us what you think about work and artist.  Less adjectives! <br><br><h3>  UPD: </h3><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/zharikovpro/" class="user_link">zharikovpro</a> suggests that during the critique it is necessary to set tasks with a measurable result and clear criteria: <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/350930/">habrahabr.ru/post/350930/#comment_10705604</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350930/</a></p>
