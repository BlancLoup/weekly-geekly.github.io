  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Doctors believe that in the near future, vaccine making machines will appear in homes and pharmacies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/344/252/b02/344252b02239941d77269da7560f396b.jpg"><br><br>  Medical organizations in many countries are developing a wide variety of vaccines, from influenza to Ebola.  Government and private research institutes are preparing vaccines not only against existing dangers, but also against those that can only appear - such work is needed to ensure the safety of citizens in the future. <br><br>  The current capacity of doctors to create vaccines is very limited.  So, there are sets of vaccines only for a specific list of diseases.  In addition, vaccines are strongly influenced by external factors.  Many of them should be stored in special conditions with constant temperature and lack of sunlight.  If a new threat appears, a solution for it, at times, has to be searched for for many months (as was the case with the Ebola pathogen). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Humanity is threatened by many dangerous factors, including ‚Äúbioterrorists.‚Äù  The latter, using the achievements of science and technology, can learn to form pathogenic microorganisms according to a given list of dangerous properties.  Several manipulations with the genotype (if it is not about viruses) and a highly dangerous organism is ready, which can affect 99% of the human race.  All this has been repeatedly demonstrated by the authors of science fiction books and movie writers.

      The model of effective resistance to dangerous organisms is our own immune system.  It does not always work very quickly, but is able to adapt to various threats.  And technology can enhance the sensitivity and selectivity of human immunity.  Biotechnology is now quite developed, so there is every chance that in the near future, people will create technology that is able to cope with the most dangerous threats. <br><br>  This, above all, is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/06/printing-vaccines-at-the-pharmacy-or-at-home-will-be-the-way-of-the-future/">to make vaccines as accessible as possible</a> , and their development is relatively simple.  According to experts, the system will be effective when vaccine development technologies are available to everyone, including individual pharmacies or even our own homes. <br><br>  Such reasoning is not based on nothing.  So, back in 2017, a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59zj9b/craig-venters-digital-to-biological-converter-is-real">miniature DNA printer</a> was <a href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/59zj9b/craig-venters-digital-to-biological-converter-is-real">introduced</a> that can be used for various purposes, including the development of vaccines.  Yes, this is not the case today, but still the development in this direction is underway.  According to market players, bio printers that are adapting to different conditions, which can be used in the formation of a vaccine against various biological threats, are not far off. <br><br>  So, now vaccine development is similar to carpet bombing, which affects a large number of potential threats, with the hope that the one that is most dangerous will be hit.  DNA printers and gene technologies in particular make it possible to use cells from an infected organism in order to identify a threat and immediately create a vaccine that is effective against a specific biological factor. <br><br>  One of the practical applications of such a printer is the creation of an "antidote" to the influenza virus, its various strains, which each year affect almost the entire planet.  As soon as several cases appear, a pathogen is analyzed in a pharmacy with special equipment and a vaccine is formed against a specific virus strain. <br><br>  Everything goes to the fact that in the near future there will be "system-on-a-chip", which can be the basis of complex mini-laboratories that produce vaccines on request.  How all this will comply with the laws of different countries, who will develop laws and regulate the entire sphere - the second question.  But if the system will prove to be really effective, then most likely there will be no problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/457906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/457906/</a></p>
