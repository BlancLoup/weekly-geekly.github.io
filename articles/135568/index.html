What the Bolsheviks were afraid to ask so long ago happened!  In the wake of cloud computing today we open the era of fog calculations! <br><br>  Misty calculations - and it sounds like something vague.  I will try to briefly convey this paradigm to the reader, unarmed by Wikipedia and Google.  For the armed ones, it‚Äôs necessary to say that this phrase has already been blown away by one of the types of cloud computing, which are fundamentally no different from them.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  So foggy calculations.  As you might guess, ‚Äúfog‚Äù is, like the ‚Äúcloud,‚Äù some related distributed computing power.  Let's apply a differential approach to the cloud and suppose that instead of a single discrete cloud node (yes, there are no nodes in real clouds and this is where the term is false) consisting of: processor, RAM, ROM, input / output devices, we have a scalar field (distribution in the amount of density) computing power, operational and permanent memory, as well as the vector field of data streams. <br><br>  At this point, you can exhale and continue to try without these problems.  Computers are getting smaller.  Computers are getting cheaper.  Now the MP3 player has a computational power much more than the first computer created for solving overly responsible military and scientific tasks.  About the size and most importantly - energy consumption, I am silent.  Now the density of computing devices is so high that it is fitting to apply statistical methods to it.  Once I saw an excellent article, where the total calculation was given.  power devices in the context of the calculus.  power of one device and it turned out that all power is not in supercomputers, but in cheap mobile phones. <br><br>  Along with cheaper computers, communication systems also became cheaper.  Bluetooth is almost everywhere and I am not sure that it is not in my sneakers.  And right now there are no obstacles left in order for all these small weak computers to unite into one big lilac computing fog. <br><br>  The ‚Äúfog‚Äù is based on a ‚Äúdrop‚Äù - a microcontroller chip with a memory and an interface for transmitting data on board, and a wireless communication chip like Mesh (sensor network).  Meals receive a ‚Äúdrop‚Äù from a small battery, which nevertheless is enough for a couple of years of work with regular breaks for sleeping (Atmel picoPower taxis).  Input devices (sensors of all colors, from temperature and voltage to position in space and ultraviolet radiation level) and output (LEDs, LCD and ice indicators, dry contacts, etc.) can be connected to the ‚Äúdrop‚Äù. It already smacks of SkyNet, not is it true <br><br>  ‚ÄúAnd when we are two steps away from a pile of fabulous wealth ...‚Äù - as the hero of a famous multi-musical sang, the most interesting thing remains - information not directly connected with these sensors can be stored and processed in this network.  Obviously, for most tasks, the performance of modern microcontrollers is more than enough and we get a field of excess computational power.  And money, cartridges and computing power, as you know, is never superfluous. <br><br>  To provide more efficient data transfer, additional tunnels will be created in the fog - some ‚Äúdrops‚Äù can have high-speed interfaces and provide better fog connectivity.  In less than 10 years, computational fog will cover the entire habitat of a reasonable person and will leave the commercial private clouds into a fog that does not have an owner.  Programs will parasitize on the computational fog and compete with each other.  This will be an ecosystem, much more lively than the Internet. <br><br>  Here is such a thing we get.  We will wait and see whether S.Lem was right in his ‚ÄúFuturological Congress‚Äù and I am in the computational fog? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135568/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135568/</a></p>
