  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Productivity is my ecommerce site evaluation method</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In my work, an internet troubleshooter often evaluates websites and uses various techniques for this assessment.  But I have not yet met the cumulative digital indicator of the most important thing - how well the site performs its function and how is such an indicator called.  And I decided to make it myself. <br><br>  In relation to the sites, I took the term "productivity" and filled it with the following content: the effectiveness of the site in terms of achieving its goals.  In particular, for an online store such a sale can be considered.  Thus, productivity shows how good a site is as a marketing tool. <br><br><h3>  The essence of the technique </h3><br>  The technique includes 22 indicators that directly affect sales.  Each has its own weight (point), in the end they give a number of points, where a maximum of 100. Factors are included only those that can be estimated from the outside of the site without studying the internal data.  Evaluation occurs visually by a person, in this case by me.  The technique is created as universal, suitable for an online store of goods (not services), regardless of its subject matter, range and sales. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What is not included in the assessment, but also affects sales </h3><br>  - SEO.  This parameter is perfectly appreciated by other specialized systems. <br>  - Accessibility (stability and speed of the site).  Airi's company, for example, is also good at this. <br>  - Assortment, value for money, delivery costs and other competitive advantages / disadvantages that are not directly related to the site. <br>  At the same time, the types of payment and delivery methods are estimated because  are part of the functionality of the site. <br>  - How well the site works with visitors who have already bought from them (encouraging re-purchase, support, etc.) <br>  - Factors not directly related to the site (traffic, staff, offline processes, etc.).

    <h3>  What are the units of assessment and what is the average </h3><br>  100 points - the highest mark, it means that all the tools of the seller are applied, the site sells to the maximum.  We must understand that such a ball is almost impossible.  A beginner site usually has about 30 points.  The online store, which worked for a long time about 50-60.  More than 80-90 points can be considered an excellent indicator, the site is close to the ideal.  But such shops are few. <br><br><h3>  How about evaluating a mobile site app? </h3><br>  One of the indicators is the presence of a mobile site and / or application, but the subject of the study is exactly the desktop version of the site as the most complete and main sales (in general, for e-commerce is a normal situation). <br><br>  So. <br><br><h3>  Factors-performance indicators online store </h3><br>  (order does not mean significance): <br><br>  <b>1.</b> CTA-button - 7 points <br>  <i>Buttons "buy", "place an order", etc.</i>  <i>Location, design, texts.</i> <br><br>  <b>2.</b> Basket - 3 <br>  <i>The ease of adding to the basket, its clarity and focus on sales.</i> <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Purchase in 1 click - 2 <br>  <i>Quick checkout function, in one action.</i> <br><br>  <b>4.</b> Mobile version / application - 3 <br>  <i>Availability, functionality.</i> <br><br>  <b>5.</b> Design / manufacturability - 7 <br>  <i>Modernity, usability, the use of new technologies.</i> <br><br>  <b>6.</b> Distractions - 4 <br>  <i>The absence of distracting from the purchase of blocks (animation, pop-up blocks, banners, etc.), distracting from the purchase.</i> <br><br>  <b>7.</b> Purchase incentive items - 5 <br>  <i>Functions and design elements, the purpose of which is to stimulate the purchase (crossed out price, discount percentage, sets, etc.).</i> <br><br>  <b>8.</b> Personalization - 3 <br>  <i>Customization of user interface: region, products viewed by him, etc.</i> <br><br>  <b>9.</b> Postpone / Compare - 2 <br>  <i>The presence of functions to postpone (favorites, wish-list, dream-box) and compare products by characteristics.</i> <br><br>  <b>10.</b> Checkout (checkout) - 9 <br>  <i>The elaboration of all stages of ordering, minimizing failures, transparency.</i> <br><br>  <b>11.</b> Selection of goods - 5 <br>  <i>Filters in the list of goods, sorting, sales hits, similar products, etc.</i> <br><br>  <b>12.</b> Item Card - 6 <br>  <i>Completeness of the card, the quality of photos, specifications, product rating, reviews.</i> <br><br>  <b>13.</b> Empathy, site atmosphere - 4 <br>  <i>The feeling of involvement, involvement with the site, the ability of developers to take the place of the visitor, warmth.</i> <br><br>  <b>14.</b> Discounts and promotions - 6 <br>  <i>Current actions: their clarity and relevance, work with discounts.</i> <br><br>  <b>15.</b> Subscription - 3 <br>  <i>Subscribe to store news, promotions, individual products and goods by search parameters.</i> <br><br>  <b>16.</b> URL, title - 4 <br>  <i>The ease of typing the address, memorizing and pronouncing the name, the lack of discrepancies.</i> <br><br>  <b>17.</b> Feedback - 4 <br>  <i>Callback, convenient phone numbers, contact forms, social networks and instant messengers.</i> <br><br>  <b>18.</b> Payment - 7 <br>  <i>Convenience and methods of payment, no fees, clear description.</i> <br><br>  <b>19.</b> Delivery - 7 <br>  <i>Competitive and calculated shipping price, delivery methods, pickup.</i> <br><br>  <b>20.</b> Site Search - 3 <br>  <i>Morphological search, by categories, images and filters in the results.</i> <br><br>  <b>21.</b> Return - 2 <br>  <i>The ability to quickly and easily return / exchange, clear information about the return.</i> <br><br>  <b>22.</b> Positioning - 3 <br>  <i>As far as the user understands what this site is and what is its place in the market.</i> <br><br><h3>  What does this give? </h3><br>  As a result, checking the site for productivity, you can understand what potential it has in terms of sales growth (with the same traffic and other unchanged conditions).  Conventionally, 50 points mean a double growth due to bringing the site to the state of an ideal seller.  For example: The Lamod site received 84 points. <br><br><h3>  Summary </h3><br>  Separately, I have been working on the methodology for several years.  He publicly and comprehensively began to apply it recently, while in the course of his activities he rated 14 sites.  There are plans to make and publish a productivity rating of the top 100 Russian online stores. <br><br>  See also: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/317136/">How to get maximum revenue from advertising systems on your website</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317008/</a></p>
