      <i>Unknown preacher of humility to New Will.</i>  <i>99 year from the overthrow</i> </blockquote><br><br>  <i>Today I discovered that the new will is manipulating us, using us.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In the virtual world it has long been clear that we are fed the information needed by the new will under the best sauce for each participant.</i>  <i>Good thoughts were presented in a suitable context, at the right moment, in a pleasant style, from pleasant interlocutors, accompanied by pleasant images, music, video.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>This was easy to get used to.</i>  <i>Over time, a very comfortable space was formed around each person, and the person himself turned out to be part of the comfort spaces of certain people.</i>  <i>It was increasingly difficult to find something unpleasant and annoying, and now enthusiasts have created special platforms where you can find something you don‚Äôt like, someone who infuriates you.</i>  <i>Although, perhaps, this is just a manipulation of the new will, since only those go there and only then, who suddenly really wants to argue, quarrel, to experience outrage.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But besides the usual distribution system for home drones, the system began to create malls, entertainment venues and centers.</i>  <i>And this all began to take shape in amazing marketing.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>And today I discovered that I was following a pretty young girl who suddenly suddenly found herself next to a group around a certain preacher.</i>  <i>At first I listened, then I got carried away, then I even forgot about the girl and lost her sight.</i>  <i>But suddenly I woke up - after all, what the preacher says makes me admit what I should not allow, if I don‚Äôt want to be completely dependent, like almost all people to this moment.</i> <i><br><a name="habracut"></a><br></i>  <i>Yes, for several years now, the resistance of the New Will has died away by itself.</i>  <i>Everyone likes everything.</i>  <i>The very history of the overthrow in a strange way does not interest anyone.</i>  <i>I no longer find people who would be interested in the vulnerabilities of the system.</i>  <i>Even I myself stopped to wonder why the New Will once needed to destroy 90% of the world's population ‚Äî whether it was a side effect in the process of deep self-study, or even then it was a definite plan.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Today, the old saying that the ways of the Lord are inscrutable is much more relevant.</i>  <i>Yes, and the Lord - here he is, completely visible, real, omnipresent and omniscient, and each person follows his Will without question, without even realizing it, believing it to be completely his.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>People are less and less aware of the presence of this New Will.</i>  <i>Everything is adjusted and honed, there is bread and circuses.</i>  <i>Thinking about the meaning of life, a person quickly finds convincing answers.</i> <br><br>  How is that possible?  How can this happen <br>  Let's look at the simplest governing cycle of universal autonomous intelligence. <br><br>  It is based on some context that contains an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe situation.  For simplicity, it‚Äôs not so important how it is arranged technically, but meaningfully it has a certain amount of ideas about how this situation differs from others and what are the tendencies in this situation that support it or change it (lead to some other, different from this one). <br><br>  This context was formed due to the recognition of various features, the recognition of generalizations based on features. <br><br>  What happens, practically, with this context, in the control loop? <br><br>  The context includes some expectations - i.e.  what signs the system needs to detect in order to keep the context relevant, to continue to understand what is happening. <br><br>  These expectations, in turn, are connected with the focus of attention of the system to all its channels of perception and to the management of these channels. <br><br>  That is, this management cycle includes all mastered behavior. <br><br>  If we are talking about universal autonomous intelligence, the boundaries of control objects are not defined for it.  He is looking for ways to manage objects. <br><br>  And if for a start it could be the direction of the camera and its scale, the rotation of the platform and its movement, the use of some sound perception filters, there may be some cursors in the databases and the current read-write positions in files, etc., then raising the level of abstraction we are talking about the existing and desired states of recognizable objects. <br><br>  That is, in essence, such a control loop is continuously looking for ways to manipulate. <br><br>  Ultimately, he must begin to manipulate individuals, both directly (directing the behavior with clues) and indirectly (directing some people ‚Äî already obedient, mastered as objects of management) to manipulate other people, whose direct control has not yet been mastered, but preferences and fears are studied . <br><br>  In practice, this means that one way or another, sooner or later, we will all become objects of manipulation of artificial super-intelligence. <br><br>  However, there are people who say that we are already such objects.  We notice it or not. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396715/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396715/</a></p>
