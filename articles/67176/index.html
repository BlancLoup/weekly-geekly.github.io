  <section class="page js-page"><h1>User motivation to create content</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I had a chance to read on Habr√© about the discovery of a whole heap of startups made in the image of Habrahabr and based on the free LiveStreet engine.  The system of ratings and ratings, habrazil and karma, and of course the system of invitations - all this, in the opinion of many, is enough for a crowd of people (and a prerequisite for an adequate people) to rush to write posts on topics chosen for the site.  Actually, habra-like rating system should solve two problems - to encourage the user to create content and filter out the "inadequate".  These functions are successfully performed on the site of IT-subjects, but is it worth hoping for their performance on other sites? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order to be able to convincingly say that such a system does not always work, I want to cite as an example a site that, firstly, is close and interesting to me on the subject, and secondly, in which a lot of effort and resources were invested.  The creators of the site can not be blamed for the fact that they did not take care of its proper initial content, or that the site was not advertised.  A large number of own materials, proper advertising, but still the site has closed.  What is this about?  About one of the Thematic Media projects - the Dribbler website, a blog hosting service dedicated to football. <br><br>  Why didn‚Äôt ‚Äúshoot‚Äù so well-proven habra-like rating system on the site about football?  Naturally, everything that will be lower is just IMHO. <br><br>  No one wants to write just like that - I think the truth is capitalized.  The user needs some kind of benefit (most often moral, although not always) from creating content.  IT people, in any case, many of us are more focused on solving individual problems.  For many of us, high karma is an opportunity to establish oneself as a specialist, quickly promote your new project, ask for advice from other high-class specialists and much more.  But why does karma need a football fan?  All he needs is for his beloved team to win next weekend, and the fans of the hateful Spartak finally admitted that CSKA is cooler (or, on the contrary, it doesn't matter).  A football fan is a person much more dependent on the team than an IT person, and therefore ‚Äúhabrasila‚Äù and his own rating are far less interesting for him than the rating of his favorite team.  But they tried to push it into the framework of habrakhabra, only the name was changed.  He did not understand this, did not become interested, and left.

      To say that somewhere there is a full-fledged blog hosting or a normal football social network with normal, adequate participants is not necessary.  So the developers have stepped onto an uncrowded Niva, but offered the user the wrong model.  As a result, there are few materials, uninteresting posts, comments uninteresting, and, what is offensive, most often inadequate.  A fan is generally problematic to persuade to behave normally ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c6/22b/557/9c622b55743763c2416fa01092523725.gif" alt="mad fan"><br>  At the moment, "Dribbler", as written on the site, "is closed for renovation."  And I, as a user, decided to fantasize how I would like to see the football online community. <br><br>  First, the site should be more ‚Äúcontent‚Äù.  By the way, the creators of Dribbler are going to do this.  Without news, fans will not talk about anything.  Part of the news and analytical articles will be written by the users themselves, if, of course, they want.  And in order to want, the rating system must remain.  But not habra-like.  It seems to me that in order to create a successful online football community, ratings for comments and posts should not affect the user's rating, but the rating of the team.  That is, each user of the site "plays" for some team, and the ratings for his comments and posts affect the place of his favorite team in the general list.  At the same time, it would be possible to make some kind of online game - make leagues, hold championships, give users the opportunity to change their team many times, and take it into the ‚Äúline-up‚Äù (to the number of people whose ratings will affect the final position of the team) or not The team captain will decide - a kind of moderator of his club. <br><br>  Collective responsibility is much stronger than individual.  Moreover, in such a collective sport like football.  And that is exactly what could motivate a football site user to write their own news. <br><br>  Frankly, the football site is in front of my eyes in almost every detail, and the conversation would be much more efficient if I could offer it to the public in the finished form.  But since I don‚Äôt find time to implement such a large-scale project, and I don‚Äôt have enough skill, I post it all in the form of a bare idea.  The idea that for each topic you need to look for your own model.  Of course, it‚Äôs impossible to say with confidence that everything will work, but it‚Äôs not worth trying to do hundreds of sites on the same system.  Collectivism, too, has not been canceled. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/67176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/67176/</a></p>
