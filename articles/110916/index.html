  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Filmbase a year later: what should be the site about the movie</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://kinobaza.tv/"><img align="left" src="http://kinobaza.tv/img/logo-white.png"></a> <br>  A year ago, I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/79739/">told</a> here, on Habr√©, about the first version of the <a href="http://kinobaza.tv/">Film base</a> . <br><br>  Many sites for the year have time to break out and die before you need to renew a domain.  But with Kinobaza everything turned out differently.  Despite the absence of any advertising or promotion service, except for posts on Habr√©, its audience is constantly growing and has <a href="http://www.liveinternet.ru/stat/kinobaza.tv/index.html%3Fperiod%3Dmonth%3Btotal%3Dno">grown</a> to 20,000 people per day per year.  So we are doing the right thing that people enjoy using and talking about to their friends. <br><br>  About what was, is, and perhaps there will be a service that we strive to make the best Russian-language film site, I will try to tell in this post.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  When I started writing, I realized that I want to tell so much that the text goes over the edge of the ‚Äúmany words‚Äù, so only the main theses remain, without flashbacks and lyrical digressions. <br><br><h2>  Why and for whom? </h2><br>  This is the main question for someone who reads this text and has not yet been at the Filmbase. <br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe service for the year has not changed.  It is intended to answer three questions: <br><ul><li>  What to watch? </li><li>  Where can I download? </li><li>  When will [right] appear online? </li></ul><br>  But the quality of the answers to these questions has increased many times over time. <br><br><h2>  Selection </h2><br> <a href="http://kinobaza.tv/filter"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4546041f/ed2875f6/9cedddf2/7767c27f.jpg" title="Film catalog"></a> <br>  There are more than 400,000 films and TV shows in the database, of which about 40,000 are available for download (these are almost all the films and TV shows available on the web).  Films and TV shows can be <a href="http://kinobaza.tv/filter">filtered</a> by various parameters (genres, ratings, release year, countries, actors / directors, video quality, voice acting language) in any desired combination. <br><br>  When you find or choose a movie / series, you can see all its distributions on the largest Russian-speaking torrent trackers (there are 14 of them and new ones are added).  You can filter and sort torrents by quality, size, translation, file type, number of peers and download the best of the distributions found. <br><br>  You can also watch the desired movie / series online (video is searched in real time on the basis of the video on VKontakte, because there it is most of all). <br><br><img title="Torrent filter" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/18544aff/d37a1a49/ada074d7/ff667efc.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Subscriptions </h2><br>  You can subscribe to notifications about the appearance of the desired movie in the desired quality and voice acting on the desired trackers. <br>  It is also possible (and necessary) to receive notifications about the appearance of new series of series that you are watching. <br><br>  Notifications can be sent to you via E-mail, via Jabber, and also via RSS. <br><br>  The frequency of sending notifications via e-mail can be configured (for example, sending notifications about the release of movies / TV shows only once a week). <br><br><h2>  Recommendations </h2><br>  After you put (or import from another site) estimates for a couple dozen films, two things will become available to you: a personal forecast of your assessment of films that have not yet been watched and recommendations. <br><br>  Also on the site you will find the feature ‚Äúmovies that rate the same as this one‚Äù, which displays those films that you should like if you liked ‚Äúthis‚Äù. <br><br>  We did not reinvent our own curve bike, so the recommendations and predictions work on one of the best engines in the world - the service recommendations <a href="http://imhonet.ru/">imhonet.ru</a> . <br><br><h2>  Personalization </h2><br>  Someone watching TV shows, someone movies.  Someone needs recommendations, and someone knows what he wants.  It is difficult to make the interface of the movie site so that it fits all.  Therefore, we leave the choice to the user.  The main page of the Film base (for those who introduced themselves to the site) has a modular structure and is fully customizable.  You can add blocks to it, delete them and move as you like. <br><br>  Want to always keep in mind the schedule for the next episodes of your TV series - please.  You need a list of movies that you recently downloaded and want to rate - move it higher. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2e3c22d0/324dce59/13800e24/d924ff2c.jpg"></div><br><br><h2>  Socialization </h2><br>  In addition to the fact that recommendations are compiled for you based on the ratings of other users, there are some other social functions on the site. <br>  You can add your friends to the ‚Äúfriends‚Äù on the site and see what they watch, evaluate or comment on. <br><br>  In addition, each user has his own page, on which you can see his film achievements :) <br>  This, of course, is not enough, so we plan to seriously improve the social component of the site in the near future. <br><br><h2>  We have cookies </h2><br>  I will not describe all the functions that are on the site, because you probably will not finish reading to the end.  I can only offer to <a href="http://kinobaza.tv/">go to the site</a> and try. <br><br><h2>  Where is the money? </h2><br>  All year the site was developed as a hobby and did not bring money (but consumed them regularly :).  We decided that the time had come to change this situation and came up with the following: a voluntary-compulsory payment is introduced on the site.  And more specifically, improved accounts appear that allow you to make the most of the site‚Äôs functions.  It is worth the improved account exactly as much as everyone appreciates the benefit of the film base for themselves.  You can pay any amount and enjoy all the benefits of an improved account. <br><br>  All money earned will be used for the development of the service.  Soon there will be a section of the site where everyone can vote with money spent on an improved account for one or more ideas on how to improve the project.  Ideas that will win in this ‚Äúvote the ruble‚Äù will be implemented first. <br><br>  And for those who carefully read up to this point - the bonus level.  Do you have time until the new year to use the promotional code ‚Äúhabrahabr‚Äù to get an improved account for a month completely free of charge (but this will not prevent you from paying if there is a strong desire;). <br><br><h2>  Future plans </h2><br>  Our service development ideas are much more than the time to implement them.  Next year we plan to do quite a few things: custom editing information about films, adding TV programs to the base of films and TV shows (with links to torrents, of course), creating an API for websites and applications, and something else. <br><br><h2>  Copyright </h2><br>  If copyright owners or their sympathizers read this text, then we have a message.  We, like you, are not quite satisfied with the current situation with copyright and the distribution of content on the web.  If you are ready to look for solutions to copyright problems not only prohibiting, but also providing an alternative - we can always agree.  Write to.  We have ideas. <br><br>  <strong>ps Foreign trackers.</strong> <br>  We are periodically asked to connect tracking foreign (especially serial) trackers.  And soon their time will come.  And if you are the happy owners of an invite to the popular foreign closed trackers - Kinobaza will gratefully accept it from you, and will subsequently be able to send you notifications about the appearance of films / series on them.  freshon.tv, tvtorrents.com, bitme.tv - some of the list. <br><br>  <strong>pps for writers</strong> <br>  If you, the reader, want to write about the film store in your blog or in any other place, we have a <a href="http://kinobaza.tv/help/blogger-special">special offer</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110916/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110916/</a></p>
