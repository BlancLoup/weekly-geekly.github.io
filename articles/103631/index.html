  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thoughts about IFA: 3D, tablets and other imposed crap</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So I returned from the IFA exhibition, but our materials on it have not yet ended - now in Moscow the active phase of montage filmed in Berlin begins, today there should be a video with all the IFA tablets. <br><br><img src="http://sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/hs216.ash2/47883_430560574711_845974711_4797097_4875517_n.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And while I'm thinking about trends.  The main trend remains the same - three-dimensional television, aggressively imposed on the population, which is visible in Germany even without glasses: 3D demo zones are installed in all large supermarkets in Berlin, and the amount of advertising for three-dimensional televisions is simply off scale.  Everything here is clear: when the production of televisions became less profitable, brands needed a new driver, because the HD-picture with all the special effects did not give a wow effect.  We got cardboard glasses with multicolored glass pieces from the mezzanine, shook off the dust from them, made a rebranding and - voila!  - Already that year the television industry is rolling in a 3D direction.  Let me remind you that the first 3D-TV was shown here, at the IFA, in the already distant 1998.  Manufacturers are not stopped by the unconditional fact that when they look at a volumetric picture, many eyes start to hurt and headaches appear, they don‚Äôt think about it yet and forge furiously while it‚Äôs hot.  It seems to me that manufacturers will soon expect a series of lawsuits from those whose health has been undermined, and in the future 3D-films will be accompanied by the words "not recommended for children and with contraindications to health."  Be that as it may, this train cannot be stopped, and those brands that did not have time to jump on its steps, did it at IFA 2010.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Technological leaders, meanwhile, have consolidated their position.  For example, Panasonic was the first to offer a complete, complete 3D ecosystem, it is logical to assume that it is not enough for consumers to only watch the 3D, but they also need to produce it.  This is still the only company that produces the entire range of consumer products of this class: using a Panasonic camera, you can shoot a 3D image on an amateur SDT750 camera, using a Blu-Ray / 3D player of a company, you can play it, and, of course, broadcast on 3D tvs  And not only LCDs, the Japanese also were the first to give out ‚Äúthree-dimensional plasma‚Äù - a new model range of 3D / FullHD-TVs of the GT and VT series.  Only Samsung has similar developments, although Koreans do not emphasize their marketing efforts on them, focusing on LED technology.  The Dutch company Philips acted smoothly, having prepared its already existing models for a 3D picture, and it was at the Philips stand that I heard the term 3D-Ready for the first time at the IFA, by analogy with the recent HD-Ready.  A high-end cinema television with an aspect ratio of 21: 9 also turned out to be ‚Äúready‚Äù for 3D.  But another trend of the company is especially impressive, which Philips is not particularly pedaling for the time being - the Dutch are actively developing technologies for watching 3D television without glasses, and, apparently, will show commercial samples next year.  This is already quite interesting - while the main limitation of this technology is that the picture looks three-dimensional only from a right angle.  However, not a single 3D - LG, for example, in the new LEX8, in addition to supporting three-dimensional images, withstood a super-thin design (1.25 cm thick!) And added a good sound, for which two seven-watt speakers are responsible.  In addition, the TV has a nano-backlight (Nano Lighting), whatever that means. <br><br><h5>  Internet + TV </h5><br><br>  The second trend was also obvious, it migrated from the two previous IFA exhibitions, at which TV manufacturers found out that the consumer, it turns out, wants to go online from the TV without getting up from the sofa.  And they don‚Äôt give them ‚Äúnaked‚Äù Internet, but already specially selected, tuned and optimized for viewing on large screens and controlling from the remote control.  Technological developments are not so important in this trend, as the ability of companies to negotiate - lawyers who actively communicate with suppliers of online content went into battle, and those who find an approach to a larger number of companies will win in the end.  Almost all large companies have their own TV-Internet-projects: Philips, LG, Samsung, Panasonic, Toshiba ... Most often, ‚ÄúTV‚Äù is amenable to video (Youtube) and photo hosting (Flickr), weather and news services, sports online communication resources and services - both text messengers (Gmail) and voice, for example, Skype.  Manufacturers use different technologies of adaptation - they re-invent browsers, develop all kinds of widgets, but everything goes to one thing: soon Internet services can be used on the TV in the same way as TV channels.  By the way, at IFA 2010 a number of companies presented several new applications based on open standards, which transform the usual teletext into something completely new, this service, of course, is also based on Internet technologies. <br><br><h5>  Tablets </h5><br>  It is much more surprising that, as a result of convergence, the mobile platform Android has also penetrated IFA - here it was brought on its fragile touch-screen tablets, they are also ‚Äútablets‚Äù.  Thank you, Apple: if earlier, after the release of the very first iPhone, most manufacturers have long realized the prospects for the product and turned up their nose, but now this is not observed - after the release of the iPad, those companies that can produce tablets immediately began development.  At IFA 2010 with the "pills" debuted several brands.  So, the main characters of the ‚Äúzero‚Äù day (day for the press) were not TVs, but tablets - Galaxy TAB from Samsung and Toshiba Folio 100. And if the Koreans, without further ado, ‚Äújumped‚Äù from the Galaxy S smartphone, leaving their 7-inch the ability to call the tablet, then the Japanese planted a more serious technological and ideological concept under Folio.  They say that one and the same content can be viewed on different screens, and if you join Toshiba Places and Marketplace programs, it will be convenient to do this with TVs, laptops, smartphones and now Toshiba tablets.  New services make it easy to upload data to the network from any device, view them and share content, and they are not strictly tied to specific gadgets, this is also a kind of rethinking Apple's hardware and service ideas, but for now everything looks foggy.  In the tablet market, debuted producer of monitors ViewSonic with its ViewPad, and the company LG, whose product is logically called Optimus PAD.  Although the Koreans did not dare to show the tablet to the public - apparently, there is something to tune.  Android was found not only on tablets, but also in players - Archos, with perseverance worthy of better use, moves its multimedia combines on Android, although, frankly, the future of these products seems vague to me, especially considering the pricing policy of the French.  Philips has updated its GoGear multimedia handheld device line by showing the Connect mini player, which, in fact, is a mobile phone on Android, but without a cellular module (3.2-inch resistive display, all Google services in a wide range). <br><br><h5>  Apple trail </h5><br>  As is known, Apple refuses to speak at techno fairs, traditionally inviting everyone to the MacExpo exhibition of itself, but the presence of this company is felt at every big event of this kind.  So, at IFA, a separate iZone zone first appeared, emphasizing the relevance of iProducts.  Here are all sorts of accessories for Mac laptops, iPhones and iPads.  Although these accessories are regularly found on company stands - for example, Philips has been actively pedaling a music docking station designed for iPad, although, of course, you can install an iPhone in it, because the connector is the same. <br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  So, the jubilee, 50th international consumer electronics exhibition IFA 2010 was one of the brightest in recent years.  And although this is largely to blame for the "non-core" for IFA tablets, it was to look at anything besides them.  It‚Äôs not a fact that this is the beginning of the revival of the techno-fairs culture, which recently have somehow lost their former authority.  I think that the IFA organizers have asked brands to save their loud announcements until September, like in the good old days, to celebrate their anniversary more loudly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/103631/">https://habr.com/ru/post/103631/</a></p>
