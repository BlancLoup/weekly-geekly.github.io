The increase was less than 2%.  According to the <a href="http://tmt-consulting.ru/category/napravleniya/">TMT Consulting</a> agency, during the same time, the base of users of broadband Internet access (BBA) in Moscow at the Moscow City Telephone Network ( <a href="http://mgts.ru/">MGTS</a> ) increased by 55,000 subscribers (or approximately 5%) - up to 1.24 million.  The subscriber base of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">Rostelecom has</a> grown by 30,000 (a 4% increase) - to almost 800,000 subscribers.  In the Moscow market, MGTS was ahead of the largest operator in the country. <br><br>  Analyst of TMT Consulting, Kirill Tatus, calculated that in the third quarter of 2015, the growth of the MGTS client base was twice as high as that of Rostelecom.  Thus, MGTS base grew by 20,000 subscribers against a growth of 10,000 from a competitor.

      Compared to last year, the situation has changed significantly. <a name="habracut"></a>  In January-September 2014, the base of broadband access users in Moscow at Rostelecom increased by 90,000, and at MGTS - by 85,000. In Moscow, the subscriber base grows only at Rostelecom and MGTS.  The base of private broadband users <a href="http://www.akado.ru/">"Akado"</a> decreased by 0.1%, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB-%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8">"VimpelCom"</a> - by 0.2%, says Tatus.  According to him, until mid-2015, Rostelecom was the fastest growing Moscow Internet provider, as the point of entry was in those houses where the competition between providers was relatively small. <br><br>  But when all such houses were completed, the number of Rostelecom connections decreased.  An intensive connection of subscribers in the new Moscow (the territories included in the city limits from July 1, 2012) could accelerate the growth rates again, Tatus believes. <br><br>  However, in the third quarter of 2015, the net growth of the subscriber base of Rostelecom in Moscow was several times more than a quarter earlier, said company spokesman Valery Kostarev, despite a slowdown in market growth rates.  According to him, the transition to a single six-month system of accounting for broadband access users, which ended in the second quarter, had a positive effect. <br><br>  The broadband access base of MGTS users grew mostly due to the re-connection of subscribers of other operators to its fiber-optic GPON network.  This is explained by the fact that MGTS has one of the lowest tariffs in Moscow.  In addition, GPON subscriber devices allow you to easily and quickly connect additional services, Tatus argues. <br>  Dmitry Kulakovsky, director of marketing and product development for MGTS, also explains the leadership in the number of connections in Moscow by the high penetration of GPON in Moscow apartments, attractive package rates and an improvement in the quality of services. <br><br>  In Russia as a whole, Rostelecom remains the leader in terms of user base growth.  In Q3 2015, it increased by 150,000 subscribers (versus 66,000 in Q2).  The second place is occupied by MTS (owns MGTS), having added 65,000 subscribers against 5,000 a quarter earlier. <br><br>  From the end of July to the end of September, the broadband subscriber base in Russia grew by 330,000 users.  Approximately 90% of the increase came in regions where the income of the population is less than average, whereas in 2014 and the beginning of 2015, the largest increase was recorded in Moscow, Tatus <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2015/10/25/614220-mgts-internet-polzovatelei">told</a> Vedomosti. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295702/</a></p>
