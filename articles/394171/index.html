GEO-alarm - a mobile application that warns at the right moment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Who, when approaching the house, didn‚Äôt find himself thinking that you might be in trouble at the entrance or behind the fence?  And what's around the corner?  Yes, even in the house or apartment you can suddenly meet a lot of dangers that appeared during the time that you were not there ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ea/ccc/ad1/1eacccad1c804574ade9c1bbd0a8001f.JPG"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  By the way, the majority of contract killings are committed at the entrance or at the door of your own house.  Recently, at the entrances of high-rise buildings, just a general invasion of drug addicts is registered, especially in the winter period.  Unfortunately, there are no special statistics on how many such inadequate people attack the residents, but to get under the distribution even from a drunken company - there is always such a probability.  Stop, security requires calm when discussing such issues, therefore we dilute the degree of unpleasant reality with the classics of the genre on this topic: ‚ÄúStirlitz returned to himself late at night.  He unlocked the door, reached for the light switch, but he heard a voice - very familiar and quiet: - Do not turn on the light.  ‚ÄúHoltoff,‚Äù Stirlitz understood.  - How did he get here?  Something happened, and, apparently, very important ... "

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc5/325/bff/fc5325bffce94a9395eba50b9aeda7ab.jpg"><br><br>  In order not to bring ourselves to maniacal suspicion, not to ask your acquaintances to go home, not to call back to your loved ones, so that they would take control of your vitality at the approaching part of the path, and at the same time stay alive and unharmed, we created solves this problem in many ways.  <a href="http://ip-concierge.com/">The IP-Concierge video service</a> completes testing of the GEO-alarm system module, designed to inform the owner of a house or apartment about possible threats before entering the deserted zone: the entrance of an apartment building, the stairwell, the courtyard of a private building or any other object with a threatening absence of witnesses. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/640/539/20c/64053920cfdf4786b89c7546447959b0.jpg"><br><br>  The principle of operation is simple, but it works on non-trivial logic.  The very moment when you need to warn about the danger, of course, is determined by the GPS coordinates.  The owner of the smartphone indicates a point on the map at the location of his home and the radius of activation of the warning.  But to warn about something or not, decides the logic of external devices that can be installed in front of the apartment or between the gate and the house.  Of course, motion sensors or cameras register a potential threat only when people are directly in front of them, and we have already said that no one will ever be confronted by security attributes.  Therefore, the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ip-concierge/blog/275624/">presence sensor</a> principle is applied: if there is at least one triggering 30 minutes before the host approaches, notify! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/940/afb/68f/940afb68ff4c408ba6af25f03b796a40.jpg"><br><br>  This algorithm fits into the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ip-concierge/blog/275426/">picture of the behavior of the attacker</a> : no one stands in front of the cameras, but no one lies in anabiosis.  For example, at the entrance these individuals constantly go up and down, adjusting to the standard behavior of the passerby.  Sensors usually operate at intervals of 2 to 5 minutes.  They try not to walk in front of cameras, only to get to the object, they still have to go past them.  Someone will ask: what will happen if the camera or the sensor is twisted?  This fact itself is easily registered by the security systems and immediately communicated to the host through the same mobile application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a27/3df/024/a273df02421a455bb7e9849b156b6422.jpg"><br><br>  Moreover, the program from Ipikonszhera, provided to the user, constantly polls the survivability of all its devices, so the person is FULLY warned about any even unpredictable problems! <br><br>  All risks are calculated by electronics, GEO-alarm system thus solves the problem of paranoia.  You no longer need to twitch and look around when you go to your home, if your phone does not beep, then the path is clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2df/217/b26/2df217b26e27471ba0ad167afcec38de.jpg"><br><br>  Although one problem still exists - the phone must be turned on.  But only the one who does not use the security outsourcing service has it.  Operators of Aipiknszherzha can check the client‚Äôs entire path in a dangerous area and take administrative measures in case of problems. <br><br>  But the application itself GEO-alarm will be available to people and autonomously, and for free.  Everyone can put a sensor in front of the door or a video camera and get warnings about their recent activity when approaching the house. <br><br>  Well, let's give your question here, we already feel, how can you not wait for you to ask it: what to do if the GEO-alarm system issued a warning?  If you are limited to a cheap option on the motion sensor, then: be more careful and, maybe, warn your friends in advance.  In this case, if you are a girl, it is better to ask some young man to hold. <br><br>  If you have a camera, and even better a few, then the phone will send you not just a control beep, but also a video of the event that caused the warning.  In a split second, you can assess the degree of threat!  Naturally, such an option, in addition to the camera, requires an additional video analyzer, and we have already crossed some video intercoms with video analytics on board, with the GEO-alarm system attached. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f77/b64/050/f77b64050ab442e98cee43c4039c8bb8.jpg"><br><br>  If you are connected to <a href="http://ip-concierge.com/">the</a> Ipikonsier <a href="http://ip-concierge.com/">outsourcing service</a> , then you don‚Äôt need to do anything - in case our person doesn‚Äôt find any reason for concern.  If there is a real threat, the operator works out a set of actions according to your choice in the contract being concluded: from calling you and your relatives to calling the police. <br><br>  <i>PS: We apologize for not being able to answer the entire flow of your questions, such are the rules here.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394171/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394171/</a></p>
