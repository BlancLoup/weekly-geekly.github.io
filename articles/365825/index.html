As it turned out, it‚Äôs not so easy to find them in regular stores, I had to go to the factory ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is no shop in the factory to buy something - you need to go to the territory.  They were greeted warmly and told that 3D printing is a new enough direction for the plant that is developing quite actively.  They even made a separate <a href="http://mz3d.ru/">website for it</a> , I'm sure that you have not heard about it, like me.

      In addition to the hot-houses and the steel frame, which I mentioned earlier (by the way, very inexpensive, I didn‚Äôt see anything like this on the market, aluminum was much more expensive), the plant presented its version of the <a href="http://mz3d.ru/shop/3d-printer-mz3d-256/">printer</a> .  It turns out that July 14, there was his presentation, about which I have not seen any references anywhere.  Probably, a few people came to it :) The printer is striking primarily with its compactness, compared with my Prusa i2, it is one and a half times less in all dimensions.  True, the printing area is also not huge: 160x160x155 mm (x | y | z). <br><br>  Ready printers in stock: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b98/a33/240/b98a332404d34c1da50b039d9176d1ae.JPG"><br><br>  Printers willingly show visitors, I was invited to see how it prints, however, I was in a hurry, so I had to refuse.  According to the representative of the plant, the aluminum table heats up to 120 degrees, the hot end up to 240. As for the hotend, I somehow doubted that it could not be heated more, since there is an E3D Volcano, which heats above 300 degrees without any problems.  Probably, the operation of the printer has not yet been checked on high-temperature filaments. <br><br>  Extruder Construction: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42f/357/645/42f357645d2846838973a5385fa39601.JPG"><br><br>  A direct-drive extruder, judging by the design, should normally press soft filament (Flex, Rubber), when I asked if it was heating up with fast nylon printing - again they didn‚Äôt answer, they probably didn‚Äôt check.  Mechanics on ballscrews, GT2 belts, thick guides with plain bearings, Y-axis on rails: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17d/545/efd/17d545efd9dd43d2986f334ad82c12da.JPG"><br><br>  I rolled the table on a semi-assembled printer, there are no backlash to the touch, it gives the impression of a rather rigid construction: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f53/845/1a5/f538451a5f754c7d9acc9bf4c24dcba9.JPG"><br><br>  I don‚Äôt know what the hammer on the table is for :) At me the collector used only a caliper and a screwdriver :) Inside - the standard Arduino Mega and RAMPS (that means if there is a need to reflash, there will be no problems) and the power supply from the LED strip.  Some doubts were caused by a small fan in the base of the printer; on my Prusa i2, a fan blows three times bigger in megu. <br><br>  Of the main advantages of the printer - print speeds up to 150 mm / s.  I was shown some details printed at this speed.  The quality is not great, but for large parts is good.  At lower speeds, the result is more positive.  There are no reviews of this printer on the Internet, there is such <a href="http://3dtoday.ru/blogs/filamentarno/adventure-printer-mz3d256-on-the-karelian-village-practical-applicatio/">an article</a> about a pre-production sample. <br><br>  And finally, awesome positive yellow frame for Prusa i3: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b39/11f/e08/b3911fe088574d849fd38a4172fbd17a.jpg"><br><br>  MZTO employee is not :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365825/</a></p>
