  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Windows users can not break away from solitaire?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many of us have seen an accountant or office manager sitting at his Windows computer and playing solitaire with enthusiasm, shifting cards from place to place throughout the workday.  Surprisingly, this <a href="http://justsolitaire.com/history.php">French game is</a> so addictive that people are able to play it every day for weeks, months and months.  What is the secret of this phenomenon, and can <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2191295/">Slate journalists try to</a> push Tetris and other competitors for the title of the most popular game of all times and peoples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/fda/8e6/06d/fda8e606d4c7a5d35f0d8ef701a3a80a.jpg" width="450" height="173" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  It is curious that during the birth of the Slate web magazine, its editors wanted to choose such a slogan for their project: ‚ÄúSlate is solitaire for a thinking person‚Äù to emphasize how annoying the habit of going to the Slate website every day to read something new can be. and interesting (for Habr, this motto would also fit in this context).  However, it was decided to abandon the idea, because such a slogan "would be too honest."

      Indeed, in terms of its fame and degree of obsession, which game can compete with the Windows card solitaire is not enough.  By the ability to ‚Äúkill time,‚Äù this game is considered canonical: from time to time almost everyone played it.  They say even George W. Bush <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html%3Fres%3D9B04EFDC1E3FF935A25753C1A9669C8B63">liked to play a couple of hands</a> on his computer when he was still the governor of Texas.  Two hundred years ago, Napoleon spent his days playing solitaire while referring to the island of sv.  Helen. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In ‚Äúpre-digital times,‚Äù the popularity of card solitaire was held back by the fact that after each hand it was necessary to mix the deck thoroughly.  That is why computers gave a second life to this game.  Automatic shuffling of cards and statistics contributed to the revival of the old entertainment.  Already by 1979, gained popularity a new version of the game, which was called FreeCell.  People played it back in the days of mainframes and terminals.  Further more. <br><br>  On PCs, <a href="http://www.teawamutu.co.nz/fun/games/solitare/klondike.html">Klondike</a> Solitaire version for the first time appeared, which was included in Windows 3.0 to help neophytes figure out how a computer mouse works.  Dragging cards and clicking on the deck, people acquired the skills necessary to work in other Windows programs.  Then such a need has disappeared, but because of the wild popularity of the game, Microsoft already, in fact, could not control its distribution and was forced to turn on solitaire in Windows 95 and all subsequent versions of Windows.  Now almost every PC has three versions of the game: Spider, Klondike and FreeCell.  However, in our time, they, too, in some way perform a teaching function, helping people to master multi-tasking work. <br><br>  According to one of the Microsoft programmers, solitaire is now the <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx%3FPostID%3D2744">most frequently launched program</a> of the entire software bundle that comes with the Windows operating system.  Three versions of solitaire belong to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/05/461035.aspx">more than half of all the time</a> that Windows users devote to games. <br><br>  Without understatement, we can say that ‚ÄúKosynka‚Äù forever changed the modern office culture.  Due to the loss of working time, according to rough estimates, Windows solitaire causes damage to the global economy in the amount of $ 800 trillion annually. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25708/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25708/</a></p>
