    <ul><li>  effective exploration of near-Earth space; </li><li>  promising near-earth spacecraft; </li><li>  man out of the earth; </li><li>  deep space; </li><li>  space services market. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Participants must provide an innovative scientific and technical idea or advanced design, technological solution for the development of promising space technology. <br><br>  The winners of the competition are developing documentation for the project at the expense of the Advanced Research Fund (up to 3 million rubles for up to 12 months).  At the same time, the winners of the competition and their working teams are employed on the condition of full employment in the youth laboratories of the FSUE ‚ÄúTsNIImash‚Äù.  Three million rubles is the budget for the development of documentation to determine the required amount of funding. <br><br>  Participate in the competition can one person.  If his project wins, he will set the staffing requirements for the implementation of his project, and free vacancies of the youth laboratory will be replaced on a competitive basis. <br><br>  <b>Requirements for bidders</b> <br>  Participants can be citizens of the Russian Federation at the age of 21 to 30 years old (if there is a candidate of science degree - up to 35 years old; if there is a doctor of science degree - up to 40 years old), as well as their creative teams. <br><br>  A mandatory requirement is the presence of higher education in one of the following areas: mathematical and natural sciences;  engineering, technology and engineering;  health and medical sciences. <br><br>  Accepting applications for the competition is open until August 1, the winners will be announced before October 4. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://fpi.gov.ru/files/kosmos/621467913.pdf">Tender documentation</a></b> <br>  <b><a href="http://fpi.gov.ru/files/kosmos/832612930.docx">Appendices:</a></b> application for participation in the competition, confidentiality agreement, information on the applicant's qualifications, consent to the processing of personal data, a form for describing an idea or decision on the development of advanced space technology, an agreement on the preparation of documentation for the implementation of the advanced project of the Advanced Research Fund. <br><br>  The participant can attach any other documents to these documents: drawings, documentation, business plan, etc. <br><br>  The confidentiality agreement imposes restrictions on the parties when working with information that has become known to them as part of the competition.  Thus, inventors whose ideas are not protected by patents can participate. <br><br>  Created youth laboratories "will be able to contribute to the technological superiority of the Russian Federation in the field of space activity in the 21st century, carrying out breakthrough research and development related to a high degree of risk of achieving qualitatively new results." <br><br>  The organizers emphasize that they are ready to consider any (even fantastic) ideas.  However, the following conditions must be met: <br><br><ul><li>  the idea must be based on well-known physical principles and not contradict the laws of logic; </li><li>  implementation of the idea should not contradict the principles of economic expediency. </li></ul><br>  Seems like an interesting suggestion.  Why not try? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e24/7e2/85a/e247e285adf7442db5a873869f960372.jpg"><br><br>  It should be borne in mind that the implementation of their ideas at public expense has consequences: the results of intellectual activity obtained from the results of the implementation of a scientific and technical project based on a laboratory at TsNIImash <b>are the property of the Russian Federation</b> .  The conditions state that for practical use they may be transferred to state authorities, state corporations or authorized organizations (for use in order to carry out the state armament program and other programs in the interests of national defense and state security). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396027/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396027/</a></p>
