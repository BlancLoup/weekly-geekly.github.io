And it just so happened that at this very moment another trouble happened - the cash ran out.  Those.  in some quantity they were present, but this quantity was not enough for purchase.  Nevertheless, in the wallet was a credit plastic card on which the necessary finances were. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      And I, in a sinful affair, conceived the impossible (as it turned out later): to find a reasonable price for me for the camera I need through Yandex.Market or Price.ru, come to the store I found and pay for the purchase with a card. <br><br>  Why card, you ask?  Because in our rapid age of technology it is very cool to pay for some things with a cashless transaction, since it eliminates the need to carry large amounts of money with you and reduces the risk of staying without this money. <br><br>  Why then is the impossible, you ask?  And because in our rapid age of technology, most stores deprive customers of the opportunity to pay for goods otherwise than in cash. <br><br>  I visited more than 20 websites of small and medium-sized stores selling digital equipment and rang the same number - and they all told me that they only accept cash as payment.  But most of all I was struck by the store Pleer.ru, which placed a link to the text <a href="http://pleer.ru/contacts_article.html">on one of the pages of its site</a> , why using cash is more <b>economical</b> and offering to receive cash in an ATM located on the territory of the store.  Could it be that the store management simply does not know about the fees charged by banks for withdrawing funds from the card?  Where is the profitability? <br><br>  Most recently, I returned from Egypt, where I clearly saw that almost every shopkeeper selling beads and other souvenirs would be happy to accept your cashless payment for their goods.  So why in Russia (and not somewhere in the outback, but in Moscow) there are such problems with it?  After all, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/37993/">how much is written about the merits of plastic cards</a> , and credit cards are issued at every step. <br><br>  I know that among the readers of Habr there are a lot of people engaged in business activities related to the sale of goods to consumers.  And I appeal to you: use the terminals for receiving payments with plastic cards and make this means of payment more affordable for buyers.  Who knows, maybe at the moment someone is considering the range of products presented on your website and hopes that even though you are from the hundred stores that you‚Äôve previously viewed, you will agree to sell the necessary thing to him without requiring you to carry a lot of paper with you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61610/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61610/</a></p>
