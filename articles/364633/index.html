If this happened in the garage, where there is a current source, all is well.  But, as a rule, the battery does not sit in a warm garage.  But rather - in the winter outside in a weak frost.  What to do?  If you are in the city and you carry with you the wires for "lighting up", then you need to "just" find another motorist who will help start the engine.  But it has become increasingly difficult recently.  Some foreign cars react to attempts to ‚Äúlight up‚Äù them in an unpredictable way - from blown fuses to dead electronics. <br>  And if there are no wires with you, the task becomes more complicated at times.  Not to mention the situations when you are not at all in the city, but very much in the village or in the country, and even fishing in a deserted place.  Whoever has been in such a situation once, as a rule, remembers her with humor, but does not want to repeat it. <br><br>  And, most likely, will be delighted "AvtoStart".  With a size with an average powerbank (139 * 75 * 15 mm, 200 grams), this djadt allows you to start the car's engine without help.  Even with the battery fully seated.  Even in the bitter cold. <br>  In the meantime, the battery of the machine does not sit down, you can recharge the smartphone or tablet - via USB, as from any ordinary powerbank. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  Help car </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d36/41e/39f/d3641e39f0c7a382eab3edde81584cf6.jpg" width="500"><br><br>  AvtoStart gives 150A current output, which is enough to start cars with a gasoline engine up to 2.5 liters.  According to the manufacturer, the device is most effective if its temperature is around 15-18 degrees Celsius.  What is not a problem if it is mainly used as a powerbank and is worn with itself.  But we started the car after the night spent in the freezer at -18 (details below). <br><br>  In order to start working with the device, you must press the power button, and wait until the charge indicator lights up.  After that, you can start work.  The scheme is quite simple, in fact - as when "lighting up" from another car: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/78a/ca9/965/78aca996576667470de1b1109a5e44a2.jpg" width="800"><br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><ul><li>  Capacity: 6000 mAh; </li><li>  Dimensions: 139 * 75 * 15mm; </li><li>  Current: 150A (peak 300A). </li></ul><br><h3>  Mobile Device Assistance </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/56c/132/328/56c1323283af84e03b21449a106c7e52.jpg" width="500"><br><br>  The capacity of the AvtoStar battery is enough for 2-3 one-time charging of the batteries of most smartphones and for fully charging the battery of any tablet. <br><br><h3>  Usage Examples / Tests </h3><br>  We asked AvtoStart's customers to conduct tests with the device, and some motorists responded to the request.  Below is a description of various problems with a car battery and various ways to solve problems with the help of AutoStart. <br><br>  <b>Test number 1</b> <br><br>  Volvo car, gasoline engine 2n.  The battery fully sat down, even the alarm did not work, I had to open it with a key.  The last time the car was started 10 days ago.  Air temperature - minus 4 degrees. <br><br>  After connecting the "Autostart" immediately began to work the alarm and the light in the car.  The car managed to start the second time. <br><br>  <b>Test number 2</b> <br><br>  Car Skoda Fabia with a 1.2 liter gasoline engine.  The car started the last time more than 2 months ago.  With the help of "Autostart" managed to start immediately. <br><br>  The second test was carried out on the same car with a cooled ‚ÄúAvtoStart‚Äù (the device was left in the freezer of the refrigerator at a temperature of minus 18 degrees).  When connecting the device to the battery, the car could not be started immediately.  ‚ÄúAvtoStart‚Äù was left connected for 3 minutes, and after 3 minutes the car started immediately. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion:</b> <a href="http://dadget.ru/katalog/avto-moto-velo/avtostart">AvtoStart is a universal charger</a> that can be useful in a variety of situations.  Start the car, charge the smartphone battery that is not in time, all this can be done with the help of AvtoStart.  There are analogues on the market, but they are all larger and difficult to carry around when using as a powerbank for gadgets.  And the dimensions of AvtoStar allow you to always keep it close by: in your bag, briefcase.  Some men with large pockets even carry it in these very pockets. <br><br>  <i><a href="http://dadget.ru/">Your djadget</a></i> <br><br>  Update: <br>  Dear users, <br>  there are many doubts in the comments about whether the device will work at all, if it will be in frost at X degrees, and if x * 2 ?, and if it is mineral oil, etc. <br>  I suggest that anyone who has a need for this device and have doubts in it, try.  Within a year after the purchase, without a talk, the dadget takes its goods back to the goods and returns the money - regardless of the good condition of the goods.  The risk is zero (except for jumps in the ruble exchange rate, but this will hopefully pass).  Why guess - try. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364633/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364633/</a></p>
