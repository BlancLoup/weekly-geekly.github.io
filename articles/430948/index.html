  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ministry of Communications proposes to tighten control over personal data</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a8/d2d/5a1/4a8d2d5a13a8f754bb1b6e744950ad60.jpg" width="350" align="left">  Recently, the Ministry of Communications made a proposal to prohibit both individuals and companies from creating publicly accessible databases with personal data collected from state information systems (GIS).  Processing of such data in this case will be strictly accounted for and certified.  As for the GIS, they should not have redundant information, as <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/11/22/787251-minkomsvyazi-pridumalo-kak-uzhestochit-kontrol-za-personalnimi-dannimi">reported</a> by Vedomosti. <br><br>  Operators of personal data who independently received them from people and transferred for processing to other persons should monitor and be responsible for this data.  Violators will be forced to pay fines.  So, private individuals will have to pay up to 2,000 rubles, officials - about 6,000, individual entrepreneurs - up to 10,000, legal entities - up to 30,000. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What can be stored in publicly available sources of personal data - names, surnames, year and metro of birth, address, subscriber number, information about the person's profession.  Also publicly available data is Incorporation, which maintains the Federal Tax Service, the Bank of Debtors of the Federal Bailiff Service, the register of suspected terrorists on the Rosfinmonitoring website, and the register of current powers of attorney on the website of the Federal Notary Chamber. <br><br>  As for fines, they threaten people who rob, process and publish a wide range of data, including the execution of these works in automatic mode.  This data includes information about property, TIN, debts, passports, border crossings.  Under the regulation, among other things, the reduction of such data in the database, the creation of sites that allow you to search for them.  In addition, it can be reference books, census data, consumer surveys, media audiences, opinion polls.

      Each GIS is now clearly described in the legislation.  In this way, publicly available data from already created GIS can be processed, if it is determined by their rules.  For example, the use of EGROUD data in databases like ‚ÄúSPARK-Interfax‚Äù, according to experts, does not violate the law.  The publicly available data that such companies collect is monetized by them - but the new regulation will allow for this type of activity.  If bills are adopted, the regulation of many GIS can be changed, and in such a way that they can not publish personal data. <br><br>  Experts say that the bills encourage personal data operators to develop and implement third-party control measures in such a way that they do not violate the law.  This, in turn, should increase the discipline of the operators, but the measures may not work, since the fines are very low.  At the same time, the new regulation will greatly complicate the transfer of personal data to processing - companies will have to take measures regarding the processing of transfer documents. <br><br>  As for telecom operators, they consider it reasonable to establish the responsibility of the operator for the actions of its contractors in the processing of personal data.  Representatives of MegaFon propose to clarify in the draft law the criteria for ‚Äúproper control‚Äù, the definition of which at the present time looks evaluative and uncertain. <br><br>  It is worth recalling that at the beginning of November, the Ministry of Communications and Mass Communications proposed creating alternative messengers.  The problem is that Russian and Chinese media face unfair competition and restrictions on the dissemination of information.  For this reason, <a href="https://habr.com/post/428784/">as stated by the</a> Deputy Minister of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media Alexei Volin at the IV Chinese and Russian media forum "Moscow and Beijing should be ready to create alternative networks and instant messengers." </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/430948/">https://habr.com/ru/post/430948/</a></p>
