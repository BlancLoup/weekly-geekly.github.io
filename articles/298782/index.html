      A diploma of a prestigious university is not the most conspicuous line in a resume, and it‚Äôs generally difficult to demonstrate your high potential on paper.  In the real business, first and foremost value experience.  Career mistake number one - to postpone its acquisition and hope that you will find a great job, having only theoretical training.  The truth is that in a fight for a good position, the grated roll wins with the realized projects in the background.  Or your classmate, who almost collapsed all the exams, disappeared after internships on internships and wrote about it in the summary.  Therefore, start preparing sleighs from junior courses - look for internships, participate in <a href="http://changellenge.com/tech/">case-championships</a> , student projects of your university.  Look for opportunities to get real work experience and not get into those 92% of students who can not get a good job because of his absence. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>2. Make career decisions based only on money.</b> <br><br>  Young professionals often take a course on more earnings, neglecting other important factors.  Few people want to work "for food", but if you're at the start of a career path, you should bet on other things.  Yes, we all have financial needs, but a career is a long game.  Career strategy and long-term settlement are the very investments that will more than pay for themselves in the future.  And do not equate happiness with money.  Remember the words of Steve Jobs, the founder of the most expensive company in the world: ‚ÄúWork will take up a lot of space in your life, and therefore the only way to be truly satisfied with life is to do what you think is great.  And the only way to do a great thing is to love what you do. ‚Äù  In general, follow your heart, not a large salary, and money will be a pleasant addition to the cause of your life. <br><br>  <b>3. Ignore the money issue</b> <br><br>  If the line ‚Äúexperience‚Äù is still empty, it is easy to go to the other extreme.  Sometimes young professionals are so eager to get a job that they don‚Äôt stutter at all about money.  ‚ÄúWhat a blessing that I was invited to an interview!‚Äù Thinks yesterday‚Äôs student and is afraid to utter the word ‚Äúsalary‚Äù.  Before the interview, do not forget to study how many competing companies offer at the same position, and during the meeting with a potential employer do not hesitate to ask about salary, bonuses, bonuses and other conditions.  It is important to learn about all the conditions still on the shore, so as not to be disappointed.  Remember: you need your company as much as you need it. <br><br>  <b>4. Go with the flow</b> <br><br>  When you are at the very beginning of your career and life, not knowing what you want is completely normal.  More than 35% of university graduates get a job, which has nothing to do with their profession in diploma.  One of the key problems of choosing in youth is the following: we do not know that we choose and often run between different career scenarios.  But it is precisely the presence of the goal that determines not only success, but also happiness.  Studies show that the happiest people in the world are people with a clear goal.  That is why it is so important to learn how to put them back as a student, and now try to understand what you really want. <br><br>  <b>5. To forget that there is a world outside of work.</b> <br><br>  Now it is fashionable to be a workaholic.  Many young careerists believe that the 8-hour working day is for weaklings, and I donate weekends for work tasks.  The saddest thing is when no one appreciates your work in the 24/7 mode, and the requirements for those who are ready to literally live at work never weaken.  Do not forget - unreasonable loads make us nervous and just miserable.  In addition, in the end, such an attitude toward yourself not only entails health problems, but also leads to a career dead end - spending all your life at work, you will stop developing.  Career expert Bernard Marr, in his article on LinkedIn, gives this example for notorious workaholics: ‚ÄúJust imagine a person who says on his deathbed:‚Äú Gosh, I should have spent more time at work! ‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>6. Too often change jobs</b> <br><br>  On the horizon, a more interesting prospect loomed, and you run to throw a statement to the boss on the table?  Millennials love to jump from one job to another.  Studies show that today's graduates by the age of 30 will have time to change a dozen or even more jobs.  There is nothing wrong with looking for different career opportunities and new ways of development, especially if you are young.  However, you still need to concentrate on your career goals and weigh each job and dismissal well.  Firstly, because an ill-considered job hopping can send your resume to the recruiter's basket with the note ‚Äúfrequent change of work‚Äù.  Secondly, an employee who has been working for a long time in one organization has more chances to become a manager.  According to a study recently published by the Harvard Business Review, the commitment of one company increases your chances of taking the top manager chair.  After analyzing the career path of all company executives from the Fortune 500 rating, the researchers found out that those who worked in the company for 15 years or more became CEOs. <br><br>  <b>7. Take seriously someone else's advice</b> <br><br>  While you are young, everyone strives to teach you how to live (yes, including us).  Let's be sincere with each other.  The most honest career advice is this: listen, analyze, shake your mustache and do everything in your own way.  Starting a career is the best time to take risks, break rules, try and make mistakes.  The overwhelming majority of the same moneybags from the Forbes 500 began their careers at very different times, in different economic and technological conditions, and therefore their secret of success may not be relevant today.  On the other hand, many of them achieved their goal precisely because they once did not listen to someone‚Äôs very sensible recommendations.  Seeing this with the examples of Gates, Jobs and Branson will help our article <a href="http://changellenge.com/billionaire-20/">‚Äú20 years - there are no billions.</a>  <a href="http://changellenge.com/billionaire-20/">More</a> . <a href="http://changellenge.com/billionaire-20/">"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298782/</a></p>
