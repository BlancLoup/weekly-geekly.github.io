      The main PHP 5.3 news that everyone is talking about is the namespaces and closures. <br>  However, in PHP 5.3 there is a lot of other new functional that makes this <br>  release of a significant milestone in the history of the project: Intl, Phar, mysqlnd modules, SPL improvements, <br>  late static binding (late static binding) and much more. <br><br>  Johannes works in the MySQL client library development team, <br>  creators of the world's most popular open source database and is learning <br>  at the University of Applied Sciences Munich. <br>  He is the release manager of the PHP 5.3 branch. <br>  and a frequent speaker at various conferences around the world. <br><br>  <b>MySQL Online Backup</b> <b><br></b>  Smirnova Svetlana MySQL Senior Support Engineer <br>  MySQL Bugs Analysis Support Group Sun Microsystems.  <a href="http://mysql.com/">mysql.com</a> <br><br>  Starting with version 5.4.x, MySQL users will have access to a new, fast MySQL [Online] Backup. <br><br>  You can backup / restore very quickly <br>  No locks - you can use your tables during backup <br>  There is no need to postpone backup until the time of minimal activity. <br><br>  The presentation will show the test results. <br>  A separate block will be devoted to comparison with existing techniques, in particular <br>  whether to abandon the decisions used in favor of the new opportunity. <br><br>  <b>Professional development of PHP-projects on the Microsoft platform "</b> <b><br></b>  Andrey Beshkov <br>  infrastructure expert, Microsoft <br><br>  <b>The practice of distributed development in open-source projects.</b>  <b>Methods, tools, problems</b> <b><br></b>  Alexander Veremev <br>  Zend Framework <a href="http://zendframework.com/">Developer's Project</a> (ZEND) <a href="http://zendframework.com/">zendframework.com</a> <br><br>  The report covers various aspects of the development in terms of the geographical distribution of the team involved in the project. <br><br>  The report is based on the experience gained from participating in the Zend Framework project at various stages of its implementation. <br><br>  The report will consider the open-source project management model used by Zend Technologies for the project. <br>  Zend Framework - responsibility for the quality of an open-source product from a commercial organization <br>  with the preferential right to make decisions, as well as the organizational features of this model - <br>  core team, representing Zend, third-party developers, <br>  interaction of the main team with the community, etc. <br>  The report particularly addresses the balance between <br>  collegial decisions and the associated overhead costs. <br><br>  The presentation will focus on the naturally evolving stages of the open-source project, <br>  as well as ways to keep the project manageable as it grows. <br><br>  Considered various tools for managing project data <br>  (versioning systems, task tracker, Wiki section on the project site) and developer communication <br>  (mailing lists, IRC, voice communication systems), as well as their applicability in different conditions. <br><br>  <b>PHP performance hints and tips</b> <b><br></b>  Alexander Veremev <br>  Zend Framework Developer's Project (ZEND) <br><br>  The report provides information on some aspects of the PHP language that affect performance: <br>  - slowing down the speed of processing strings when assigning a variable by reference; <br>  - processing of circular references in the structures of objects; <br>  - inefficiency. = Operator in certain conditions; <br>  - low speed serialize () / unserialize (); <br>  - manual ‚Äúmethods inlining‚Äù; <br>  - use of objects in complex structures, replacing them with arrays in some cases, performance. <br><br>  <b>Decba daemon Pinba - realtime statistics for PHP</b> <b><br></b>  Anton Dovgal by pinba, <a href="http://pinba.org/">pinba.org</a> <br>  developer, badoo.com <a href="http://badoo.com/">badoo.com</a> <br><br>  When developing large projects, it is often the case that performance problems emerge after implementation, in spite of all the preliminary calculations and tests. <br>  From this you can not escape, but this can not be tolerated.  Pinba helps developers monitor the performance of their project in the most detailed way - right down to specific operations on specific servers, which allows to reveal bottlenecks on a live, working project in real time. <br><br>  The target audience <br>  Developers, system administrators <br><br>  Application area <br>  Projects above the average size, with a large amount of code. <br><br>  <b>Sphinx 2009.</b> <b><br></b>  Aksenov Andrey by Sphinx <br>  <a href="http://www.sphinxsearch.com/">www.sphinxsearch.com</a> <br><br>  Overview of new features that appeared in the Sphinx for the 2009th year. <br>  - MySQL protocol and SphinxQL <br>  - RT indexing (alpha) <br>  - string attributes <br>  - query processing models (fork, prefork, threads) <br>  - new position format, without positioning <br>  - cache of common subqueries <br>  - "mixed" characters <br>  - aggregate functions <br>  - and 10+ other interesting features <br><br>  Flipchart session: Fear the forks: Undocumented subtleties of processing integers, real numbers and <br>  arrays in php and how to deal with them. <br><br>  <b>How to turn an application into a platform.</b> <b><br></b>  Vadim Kryuchkov (long), head of the development department at Oversan. <br><br>  Having started developing a cloud hosting control panel, we set ourselves <br>  The goal is to make the most convenient application for users.  Well, for us, <br>  developers, it should also be convenient - since in Russian <br>  no one has done this before, it was necessary to build a very flexible one <br>  an application so that it can be easily changed for requests <br>  user and marketing.  Our system consists of many individual <br>  applications that are written in different languages ‚Äã‚Äãand must interact <br>  between themselves.  How?  REST came to help us.  But then another one got up <br>  problem - you need to "protect" from advanced users who <br>  after analyzing the requests, you will build your applications using our <br>  API.  Then we decided to go from the reverse - open the API for developers. <br>  So how do you design a good API?  Why choose REST?  how <br>  to build an effective application and deploy it in the cloud?  About this and <br>  other goodies that cloud computing carries, i'm ready to tell in <br>  this report. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/68534/">https://habr.com/ru/post/68534/</a></p>
