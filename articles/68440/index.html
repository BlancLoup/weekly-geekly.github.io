The company introduced a browser with an elegant interface that includes a number of innovative technologies.  Opera 10 is available in 43 languages ‚Äã‚Äãin versions for Windows, Linux and Mac operating systems.  It can be downloaded at <a href="http://www.opera.com/">www.opera.com</a>

      Three innovations of Opera 10 that are definitely worth a try. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Opera Turbo - information compression technology that solves the problem of slow data loading when working on low-speed channels.  Whether you access the network using a 3G modem on the road or use an overloaded Wi-Fi hotspot at the airport - Opera Turbo will speed up data transfer and ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù the Internet. <br><br>  If you‚Äôre tired of waiting for Web sites to load, turn on Opera Turbo‚Äôs browser-embedded technology and work at speeds close to broadband Internet.  Opera Turbo automatically detects data transfer speeds and, in case of its decline, is capable of compressing the contents of a web page for faster loading.  Under laboratory conditions, the technology provided an acceleration of up to eight times compared with other browsers. <br><br>  Scandinavians obsessed with packing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DtYEUFwJXVvw">www.youtube.com/watch?v=tYEUFwJXVvw</a> <br><br>  2. Excellent interface <br>  Opera browsers have never looked so elegant.  For Opera 10, we have developed a new interface with a convenient and logical arrangement of the menu and buttons for calling options. <br><br>  3. Improved tabs <br>  Opera remains a pioneer in the use of tabs.  Opera 10 allows you to change their size by stretching the bottom border or by double-clicking the mouse.  The new browser is capable of displaying thumbnails of open tabbed sites. <br><br>  By default, Opera 10 tabs are rendered at the top of the screen, but they can be moved down or into the side panels, which is especially convenient when using widescreen monitors. <br><br>  Opera 10 includes other updates that increase productivity and increase efficiency in the Internet: <br><br>  - Customizable Express Panel <br>  The express panel Opera 10 has already received recognition from the Internet community.  Now it has become customizable in accordance with the personal preferences of users.  Do you have a big monitor?  Install 5x5 sites in the Express panel for quick access.  In addition, now your favorite picture or photo can be made the background in the Express panel. <br><br>  - Quick access to Russian-language services <br>  <b>"Yandex"</b> .  In addition to the search capabilities from the browser panel, now Yandex has become the default search in the Express panel. <br>  <b>VKontakte</b> .  Now, from the Opera 10 Search Panel, you can send requests to the largest VKontakte social network in RuNet. <br>  <b>Mail.Ru.</b>  Browser bookmarks by default include a link to the main page of the largest communication portal of the Russian Internet Mail.Ru.  From the Express panel of the browser, you can go to the Games.Ru project with one click.  You can search for information through Search@Mail.Ru directly from the browser search bar. <br>  <b>"OZON.Ru"</b> .  Searching for books, music, video and other products in the largest Russian online store has become even easier.  Now you can do this from the Opera 10 Search Panel, and download OZON.ru using Bookmarks and Speed ‚Äã‚ÄãDials, in which links to the main page of the site are set by default. <br><br>  - Automatic update for more security <br>  Opera 10 is now updated automatically, so you can always work with the latest version of the browser.  Thus, users benefit from all the innovations of the browser, and a powerful system for registering failures is designed to make it even more stable. <br><br>  More information about browser security is available at <a href="http://www.secunia.com/">www.secunia.com</a> <br><br>  - Check the spelling <br>  No more typos!  The spelling checker based on the open dictionary Hunspell supports 51 languages, including Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian. <br><br>  - Improved email system <br>  The built-in browser Opera 10 email client gives access to e-mail at any time.  Opera Mail has extensive capabilities for organizing email messages and contacts, as well as searching them.  It became even more convenient to follow the discussion with the option of sorting messages in the form of a tree, and the built-in spell checker eliminates errors and typos when typing text messages. <br><br>  - How to become the fastest on the Internet <br>  High speed browser is a combination of several factors.  First of all, we improved overall kernel performance and accelerated the loading of pages with large amounts of data (such as, for example, Gmail).  According to our measurements, Opera 10 was 40% faster than Opera 9.6, and that‚Äôs before you turn on Opera Turbo!  However, this is not all.  Opera browsers are not only light and fast, but also intelligent.  The system of adaptive management allows the most optimal use of computer resources with a small amount of memory and, conversely, utilize more PC resources with a large amount of free RAM. <br><br>  - ‚ÄúToy‚Äù for web developers <br>  Web developers will appreciate the latest version of the Opera Dragonfly website debugging and optimization application, available in Opera 10 browser. Opera Dragonfly, available in 36 languages, now allows you to edit Document Object Mode (DOM) and check HTTP headers.  In addition, Opera 10 is 100% tested for compatibility with ACID3 web standards and supports web fonts for CSS3. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAt Opera, we are constantly working on new tools for improving online work for everyone and for everyone,‚Äù said Jon von Tetzchner, chief executive officer of Opera.  ‚ÄúEach of us is confronted with slow Internet access channels, and I believe Opera Turbo will be useful for all users, no matter how often and at what speed they work on the Web.  Now the problem of slow Intenet has a solution, and it is absolutely free.  We are pleased to present the final version of Opera 10 and we hope that it will attract more users in addition to the 40 million that have already chosen our browser for safe, interesting and easy work on the Internet. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Resources</b> <br>  Download Opera 10: <a href="http://www.opera.com/">www.opera.com</a> <br>  Opera 10 Review: <a href="http://www.opera.com/press/reviews">www.opera.com/press/reviews</a> <br>  Video trailer: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DqHKGQ6sGauk">www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHKGQ6sGauk</a> <br>  Screenshots of Opera 10: <a href="http://www.opera.com/press/resources">www.opera.com/press/resources</a> <br>  Learn more about the unique features of Opera 10: <a href="http://www.opera.com/products/desktop">www.opera.com/products/desktop</a> <br>  List of changes in the latest version of the browser: <a href="http://www.opera.com/docs/changelogs">www.opera.com/docs/changelogs</a> <br>  Opera desktop browser developers blog: <a href="http://my.opera.com/desktopteam">my.opera.com/desktopteam</a> <br><br>  <b>About Opera Software ASA</b> <br>  The company Opera Software ASA has opened up new possibilities for viewing web pages on PCs, mobile phones and other Internet devices.
