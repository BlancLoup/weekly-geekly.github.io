Today we will talk with you about digital transformation (digital transformation), the very buzzword that everyone is talking about, but no one knows how to do it.  This is the first article in the cycle in which there will be more theory.  Under the cut, you will learn about how the transformation differs from automation in the example of the grandmother's business, find the top 10 cases from Microsoft, and also tell you a little about the new Tech Acceleration program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yh/hv/wt/yhhvwtrqvaqonddqz3v2e3dnuxi.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote><h2>  Series of Digital Transformation articles </h2><br>  Technological articles: <br><br>  1. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/341854/">Start</a> . <br>  2. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/342364/">Blockchain in the bank</a> . <br>  3.

      A series of interviews with Dmitry Zavalishin on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJuwCFeP6rhSUqk9gRMAwuw/feed">DZ Online</a> : <br><br>  1. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/342596/">Alexander Lozhechkin from Microsoft: Do we need developers in the future?</a> <br>  2. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/345662/">Alexey Kostarev from ‚ÄúRobot Vera‚Äù: How to replace HR with a robot?</a> <br>  3. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/346870/">Fedor Ovchinnikov from Dodo Pizza: How to replace the restaurant director with a robot?</a> <br>  4. <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/348670/">Andrei Golub from ELSE Corp Srl: How to stop spending a lot of time on shopping trips?</a> </blockquote><br><h2>  Digital transformation on the example of the grandmother's business </h2><br>  Most often there is confusion in terms of automation and digital transformation, and, consequently, in understanding the essence.  Therefore, we propose to start with this. <br><blockquote>  For ease of understanding, we will draw an analogy with the business of the grandmother, which knits socks.  Imagine that her name is Lydia Petrovna, she is 73 years old, she is from Russia and weaves 1 pair of wool socks a week, and then sells them on the market, not far from home. </blockquote><br>  As you can see, the example above is a typical example of a business based on manual labor.  Let's try to automate it. <br><blockquote>  Lydia Petrovna has a wonderful grandson, Vasily.  He worries that his grandmother has too much work, she gets tired, and you don‚Äôt earn much from 4 pairs of socks a month.  Therefore, he proposes to digitize the design of grandmother's socks, to buy a robot ‚ÄúSuper Knitter 2000‚Äù, which can knit 100 pairs of wool socks a week.  And why go to the market when you can create a website through which you can sell socks.  Grandma will only need to control the production process and fill the site with new products. </blockquote><br>  <b>Automation</b> - processes that previously required the involvement of "manual" labor, were differently automated, depending on the type and type of process. <br><br>  So, we go further. <br><blockquote>  As time went on, Grandma's knitting business grew and flourished.  With the onset of spring, Lidia Petrovna realized that she needed to look for new markets, agreed with ski resorts around the world and added thinner socks to the range especially for Australian buyers.  Innovations Basil greatly facilitated her work and she began to earn much more.  Lydia Petrovna began to look younger and was thinking of moving to a warm country for the coming winter. <br><br>  But, as always, not everyone was happy about her success.  The neighbor, Maria Ivanovna, realized that our grandmother was doing well and asked her grandson to buy her the same robot and digitize her ideas for socks.  At the same time, Grandmother Fernanda from Brazil, already dumping prices for Lydia Petrovna‚Äôs socks in some ski resorts.  And on the forums they talked about the mysterious grandmother Ataro from Port Elizabeth, who was going to offer an innovative design. <br><br>  It would seem that my grandmother's business began to lose ground literally.  But, Vasily did not become discouraged and offered to change the business model: create a global resource with delivery by drones, in which grandmothers from all over the world could upload their sock designs and sell them in all corners of the planet.  Lidia Petrovna was not sure that anyone would agree to this.  But Vasily explained that due to data collection and the use of machine learning algorithms, other grandmothers will be able to get more accurate analytics, which means they will improve their sock models using a data-driven approach.  And, of course, it is quite obvious that this will allow them to sell socks in much larger volumes.  Not to mention that they will no longer be concerned about the issues of logistics, wool purchases and purchases of the new model "Super Knitter X". <br><br>  This is how the resource super-knit-socks.lp came into being, which became the world's largest service for selling socks. <br></blockquote><br>  <b>Digital transformation</b> - changing the business process with the help of modern digital technologies, data-driven hikes, occurring under the influence of competition. <br><br>  Of course, in the real world, the transition from automation to transformation is much more complicated and involves much more detail, but nevertheless, we hope that you understand the general essence of the process.  Go ahead. <br><br><h2>  10 cases of digital transformation from Microsoft </h2><br>  It seems that we have never told on Habr√© about the mission of Microsoft: <b>to</b> help each person and every company on the planet achieve more). <br><br>  It sounds great and we are really imbued with this idea.  We can say that it forms the basis of the digital transformation and describes the desire to help various companies transform with the help of the latest technologies.  We will not dwell in detail on the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the company, since if you wish, you can find a lot of materials on this topic.  For example, a month ago there was a wonderful <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/tehnologii/350973-glava-microsoft-satya-nadella-mir-izmenyat-tri-tehnologii-i-nemnogo-empatii">interview on Forbes with Satya Nadella</a> in which he talks about three technologies that will change the world and a little about how the corporation has changed in a few years (by the way, this is all absolutely true). <br><br>  It will be much more interesting to talk about cases about which you could already hear: <br><br><h4>  1. <a href="http://www.else.shoes/">ELSE.shoes</a> </h4><br>  The solution that allowed fashion brands to open virtual 3D boutiques of customized shoes.  The uniqueness of the project lies in the fact that buyers can independently create for themselves the perfect match for their needs: taste, foot features and other preferences.  You can read more about the ELSE Corp solution and its implementation using Azure technologies <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/ru-ru/features/tech-couture/">here</a> and <a href="https://rb.ru/opinion/tehnologii-dlya-oflajna/">here</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FjHMDW6YB0s&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjjjY-etcuXQQBswB9jC5wWMuJo5w"></iframe><br><br><h4>  2. <a href="http://courseiq.golf/browse/club">Microsoft Course IQ</a> </h4><br>  In this project, created with the world famous golf course designer, Gilbert Hans, Microsoft shows a new perspective on working with data in the sports industry.  Information is collected from various sources of sources (ranging from analysis of the landscape and wind speed, to weather data at different times of the year), including using drones and aerial photography, and processed using Azure machine learning tools (for more than 13 thousand golf courses).  This allows designers to effectively evaluate the chosen landscape for future fields, and golfers to evaluate the best positions for playing on existing fields.  By the way, this project was the bronze medalist of the Cannes Lions Festival 2017. For more details, see the <a href="http://partners.wsj.com/microsoft/transforming-the-course/">WSJ</a> article. <br><br><h4>  3. <a href="http://www.lowesinnovationlabs.com/hololens">Lowe</a> </h4><br>  If you are watching the broadcasts of key Microsoft conferences, surely you should have had a demonstration of Satya Nadella on the keynote report Ignite, which took place a year ago.  On it we saw how using the technology of mixed reality and HoloLens you can create custom design for your kitchen.  The pilot project was launched in two stores: while in the showroom, customers can select their own kitchen design from all available products in Lowe stores using simple gestures.

MCSC (Canadian Missing Children Search Society) </h4><br>  Not all projects that can be attributed to digital transformation are commercial.  Last year, we already told you about a non-commercial project in which, using Xamarin and Azure, a solution was created to quickly collect information about a missing child and automatically send data to law enforcement agencies.
