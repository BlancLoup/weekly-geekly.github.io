The topic of conversation: how and what can get a software developer from Intel. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What devices can get developers Windows 8 applications?</b>  <b>(Including educational applications)</b> <br>  Intel Developer Zone members can get devices to test and develop their applications.  In our "pool" - tablets, smartphones and ultrabooks from well-known manufacturers (Lenovo, Acer, Asus, Samsung) based on Windows 8 and Android, as well as SDP (Software Development Platform), which are manufactured under the Intel brand (n. P. <a href="http://ultrabooknews.com/2013/07/30/windows-8-developers-this-is-your-ultrabook-introducing-harris-beach/">Harris Beach Developer Ultrabook</a> is a perfect exclusive, there are no such devices on sale and it is not expected).  We currently have 3 types of devices based on Windows 8 OS: Samsung ATIV Smart, Acer Iconia W510, Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 2. With the advent of the Bay Trail, we are looking forward to replenishing our stocks with devices based on new processors. <br>  No less important is the item ‚ÄúHow to get these devices,‚Äù since we, of course, do not distribute them to the right and left.  First of all, we look at applications with a hint of innovation, because  all developers who have received the device are candidates for participation in our co-marketing program.  To get a device, you first need to go through a formal stage - register in the <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru">Intel Developer Zone</a> program.  Next - send information about your application to <a href="">ispprussia@intel.com</a> .  We will evaluate your application based on the following criteria: innovation, performance, quality of the interface.  If we decide that your application has the potential, then you get a device for development and testing.  In addition, a personal account manager is attached to you, who will provide support during the development and, if necessary, involve Intel engineers to solve specific issues.  After a certain period of time (as agreed with the account manager, usually 3 months), you will be asked to provide a modified version of your application to test it and decide on your participation in the co-marketing program. <br>  The devices listed above, you get for long-term use.  If you urgently need to test your application on a specific Intel platform, including a server system, then you can send a request for a "Quick Test".  This initiative is relevant for developers from Russia and gives you the opportunity to access the equipment for a period of up to two months.  It is necessary to fill out an application <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/fastaccess-program">on the site</a> , within 48 hours we will respond to your request.  If the required device is available, then you can pick it up from the Moscow office of Intel on the same day or we will arrange remote access for testing. <br><br>  <b>How can I get marketing support?</b>  <b>(Including for the AIC contest application)</b> <br>  For the winners of the App Innovation Contest, marketing support is provided as specified in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/special/intel/aic2013/prizes/">the contest rules</a> .  This is a PR campaign, a success story and a video interview on the Intel DZ website, a demonstration of the application at events of Intel and partners (including Lenovo), mention in the Intel DZ mailing list, social media.  And, of course, marketing support is provided for the three winners in the Education category.  Contestants who are not among the winners can apply for marketing support on a general basis.  The requirements for the application were discussed in the previous paragraph.  Additionally, add that the application must be at least in the RC stage, i.e.  We will not consider demo applications.  Information about your application, including a description of the unique functionality, should be sent to <a href="">ispprussia@intel.com</a> . <br><br>  <b>I want to understand what a co-marketing program is in principle.</b>  <b>What is included in it?</b> <br>  A co-marketing program is an aid in promoting your product, expanding the audience of users.  One of the basic tools today is the demonstration of applications at our events and electronic catalogs.  During the year, Intel not only holds its own conferences, but also participates in many industry events.  At the exhibition stands we show devices based on our processors.  Visitors to the exhibition are interested to see the capabilities of these devices.  If your application is optimized for our platforms and technologies and has interesting functionality, then you are the No. 1 candidate for including your application in the list of demonstrations. <br>  An electronic software catalog is a recent initiative.  To date, we have a catalog of software partners for <a href="http://software.intel.com/pams/ultrabookdeviceapps/">Ultrabooks based on Windows 8</a> and a catalog of software for Android x86 devices is planned in the near future.  Why create another application catalog?  Here we had several goals.  In the Windows Store and Google Play today there are hundreds of applications, many of which are far from the highest quality.  Our online storefronts have partner solutions tested on our platforms.  For colleagues from other divisions of Intel (for example, the sales and marketing department), this is a single resource for finding interesting applications to be demonstrated in retail.  For an external user, this is a guarantee of software quality from Intel.  By the end of this year, we will launch a catalog of Russian developers, which will get 20 of the best applications for ultrabook.

      In each quarter, we have new initiatives for developers for different platforms.  In the current quarter, Intel launched a co-marketing program for developers of Android applications, which is associated with an increase in the number of devices based on Intel Atom processors.  You can get $ 5,000 for marketing your application.  The first will be considered NDK Android applications, as well as applications with the ability to implement technology WiDi.  If you are interested in this initiative, then before November 15, you need to send information about your application / link to the application on Google Play at <a href="">appslab@intel.com</a> .  Intel experts will evaluate your application for possible optimizations.  If you need to add x86 support, then you can get an Android device based on Intel Atom for testing.  Further, all applications submitted for participation in the initiative will be evaluated by 5 criteria: 1) availability of support for 86 architecture;  2) performance;  3) interface quality;  4) innovation;  5) use of Intel technologies (WiDi, Project Anarchy, IPP, GPA, etc.).  Top 5 applications will receive marketing support from Intel. <br>  You can learn more about the development of applications for Android x86 and WiDi technology from our <a href="http://youtu.be/d-SiN43IvC8">recent webinar</a> . <br><br>  <b>Pro NDA and release plans are definitely very interesting.</b>  <b>Let's say we are very interested in the development plan of the PerC SDK and everything connected with it.</b> <br>  As an Intel partner, you are sure to sign the NDA with us.  Companies that have a personal account manager receive quarterly information on our roadmaps and features of platforms being prepared for release in the near future.  If you have specific questions (in this case PerC), then you need to write to us at <a href="">ispprussia@intel.com</a> . <br><br>  <b>We once won <a href="http://hackday.ru/events/hackday-25/custom">the PerC SDK hackathon contest</a> , RC is about to hatch.</b>  <b>The question arises - what does this give us (and does it even provide?) In terms of co-marketing in addition.</b> <br>  Intel arranges hackathons and contests to tell you about new technologies, to encourage you to create an innovative product.  Our Developer Relations Division does not actively support startups.  Those.  there are no additional benefits in terms of co-marketing, besides what was mentioned above, you do not get. <br><br>  <b>Can Intel help find partners / customers (meaning b2b scheme)?</b>  <b>Let's say somehow ‚Äúreduce‚Äù with device manufacturers (for example, the same laptops)?</b> <br>  The answer to this question is very dependent on your goals, and each such request is more correctly addressed to <a href="">ispprussia@intel.com</a> .  We are often asked about the possibility of pre-installing their software on the devices of OEM partners.  In this case, the answer is no.  We do not help with questions of preset, since  1) decisions about software pre-installation are not made in the Russian OEM divisions, 2) OEM (Samsung, Lenovo, etc.) have a pool of their own applications for pre-installation.  We can only recommend OEM to pay attention to this or that application.  Ultabook Showcase, which I talked about in response to a question about co-marketing, is just such an advisory tool.  All OEMs are aware of the existence of our partner application catalog and can make their own decisions about pre-installing the application that interests them. <br><br>  <b>Please tell me how you can get information or advice on programming various hardware from Intel, ranging from processors (there are questions that SDM or datasheets cannot answer), and ending with xHCI.</b> <br>  The <a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru">Intel Developer Zone</a> site is the main resource where you can find answers to many of your questions.  In essence, Intel DZ is a huge library of content (technical articles, blogs, forums) created over the course of several years by Intel experts and experts from our community.  Most of the content is localized.  If you are unable to <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/search/site">find</a> the information of interest on the pages of the site, then you can always ask a question to Intel engineers on the <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/forum">English-language forum</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201248/</a></p>
