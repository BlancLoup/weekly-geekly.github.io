    <h4>  A short introduction to the Mesh Network, for those who are not familiar with them </h4><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/cK73sYM3g0Q%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhil8HdaB2xHu26w7aQY2jcrB4QgRg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  What is it ? </h4><br>  This is a peer-to-peer network that operates in two modes: <br>  1) Through the Internet creating an overlay network <i>(which works ten times faster than Tor and I2P)</i> <br>  2) Between routers directly. <br><br><h4>  How it works ? </h4><br>  As I already mentioned, the network operates in two modes, but the basic principles of operation are the same for both modes. <br><br>  To access the network, you need to install software that acts as a router - <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/">CJDNS</a> <br><br>  During the installation, your public and private keys will be created, a tunnel device will be created for which iPv6 address will be generated. <br><br>  Then, to connect to the network, you must: <br>  1) When connecting via a regular Internet, find an already existing network node and find out its address and key <br>  2) When you connect a router router - everything happens independently. <br><br>  After connecting, you will get access to the entire network, your traffic will be encrypted, it will not be possible to decrypt or censorize it. <br><br><h4>  Network goal </h4><br>  Create small islands of network freedom on the basis of a router-router and unite them together via Internet channels. <br><br>  Due to the fact that the network does not have access to the normal Internet, users submitting their channel will not be afraid to get a subpoena for breaking the bank through its router. <br><br>  In this way, the network will be able to grow and cover new spaces. <br><br><h4>  IPv6 </h4><br>  On the network, you generate an IPv6 address that belongs to the private part of the IPv6 address, which means there will be no collision between the real IPv6. <br><br>  In addition, <b>any</b> application will be able to work on the Hyperboria network if it supports work through IPv6. <br>  After installing the necessary software, the traffic is automatically redirected to this network, which allows you to avoid additional infusion of programs. <br><br><h4>  Anonymity &amp; Privacy </h4><br>  Hyperboria network is private - your traffic can not be decrypted by anyone except the node to which it should be delivered. <br>  The network is NOT anonymous, the purpose of the creation was not to make an I2P / Tor clone, but to make a new Internet, so using the trace you can find out the chain of nodes and find out your IPv4 address, it is obvious that when connecting a router-router type, this problem will disappear and the network will become same anonymous. <br><br><h4>  Traffic routing </h4><br>  Traffic routing is provided using a system similar to Kademilia DHT, more precisely, the route catalog is constantly updated due to the fact that the network configuration can change, thus the network maintains an optimal load through all nodes and selects the shortest path for traffic. <br><br><h4>  DNS </h4><br>  Currently, a system is being developed that could replace the DNS, making it decentralized, options for using Namecoin or similar services are being considered, now domain name conversions are performed using the existing DNS service of the regular Internet (prescribing AAAA addresses) <br><br><h4>  Is the project alive?  or is he dead like Netsukuku </h4><br>  The project is more than alive, it exists: <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cjdns">Article in the English Wiki</a> <br>  <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/">Short description on GitHub</a> <br>  <a href="https://wiki.projectmeshnet.org/Main_Page">Own Wikipedia</a> <br>  <a href="">WhitePaper</a> <br>  <a href="http://hyperboria.net/">Hyperboria network site</a> <br>  Direct communication with developers via <a href="http://chat.efnet.org:9090/%3Fchannels%3D%2523cjdns%26Login%3DLogin">IRC</a> <br>  The network operates in the <a href="https://wiki.projectmeshnet.org/List_of_Mesh_Locals">following</a> cities: New Zealand, Seattle, Philly, Dallas, Chicago, Ireland, Phoenix, New York, Vancouver, Denver, Minneapolis. <br><br><h4>  Supported Platforms </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58a/c83/164/58ac83164b7bb0a9f419ed013233d40d.png"><br>  Network creation software works great on all UNIX-like platforms, Linux, Mac. <br>  Most recently, the <a href="https://fund.meshwith.me/">collection of money</a> began in support of porting to Windows, the money has almost been collected, in addition, those who paid $ 125 will receive a router that works out of the box on this network. <br><br><h4>  How to install? </h4><br><br>  Then edit /etc/cjdroute.conf by entering the address of the peer that is already connected to the network. <br>  For all other operating systems, instructions can be found <a href="https://wiki.projectmeshnet.org/Getting_started">here</a> . <br><br>  <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns">Official</a> setup <a href="https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns">instructions</a> on any hardware <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Perhaps this is the first Mesh network that really knows everything about what was announced, which does not die due to the lack of a developer who has a live community. <br><br>  Now the network resembles the Internet of the 90s, there is no advertising in it, the sites are mainly made only for ‚ÄúFor Your Own‚Äù, here you can get free file hosting without ads, hosting wordpress blogs, a local search engine, and so on. <br><br>  In the end, I would like to say the following, when I, as probably many people, read the specifications of Netsukuku, hoping that a working sample would appear, so that it would be mono to test and see the work, I was very happy to hear about this network, which performs all the functions of the deceased Netsukuku. <br><br><h6>  Be careful when you are online you can access directly without NAT at your IPv6 address! </h6><br><br><h6>  If this direction will be interesting to you, what the voting will show, I plan to translate the whitepaper, to disassemble the principles of network operation (routing), to consider aspects of anonymity, and so on. </h6><br><br><h4>  More about Hyperboria: </h4><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/181862/">Hyperboria: Internet 2.0</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182652/">Hyperboria: How it all works</a> <br>  <a href="http://hype.rusblock.com/forum/index.php">Network Forum</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181862/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181862/</a></p>
