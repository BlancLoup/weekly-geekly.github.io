We too announced it on Habr√© this spring, however, then he was part of UniverTV and was on the subdomain.  Later we decided to launch the project on a separate site - <a href="http://interneturok.ru/">InternetUrok.ru</a> . <br><br> <a href="http://interneturok.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f2/cc/f2ccdaf5fde2d567e71dde463fd0a9f8.png"></a> <br><br><h4>  Why do we do it </h4><br>  For those who do not know, briefly tell about what InternetUrok.ru.  This is a collection of video lessons on the main subjects of the school curriculum - constantly updated, in the public domain and without advertising. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Not every school has teachers who are able to talk about their subject in an accessible and interesting way.  Some children study at home, some skip school because of illness, and there are those who cannot attend school at all.  Do not forget about the lagging students who need help (while not everyone has the opportunity to take a tutor). <br><br>  In addition, children study in the former Soviet republics, for whom Russian is their native language, but there are problems with teaching in Russian. <br><br>  It will not be a discovery for Habr's visitors that more and more often the society is broadcasting signals: ‚ÄúThe Internet is a cesspool‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe Internet is dangerous for your children‚Äù.  We believe that you understand how accessible educational, cultural, and educational projects are in such a situation. <br><br><h4>  What's the Difference </h4><br>  UniverTV began as a compilation of the best educational videos from around the world.  We searched, watched, selected lectures and speeches at conferences.  Some of them we translated, then began to attract teachers from Russian educational institutions to work on the project.  From individual lectures, we gradually move to the whole course. <br><br>  With the InternetUrok.ru resource, things are somewhat different.  Instead of a selection of individual videos in the directions, we began to move purposefully through the school curriculum.  In fact, the whole project is one big school course. <br><br>  Materials are systematized not only in subjects, but also in classes of the school program. <br>  On the content of any lesson, you can ask questions, you can discuss the material covered. <br><br><h4>  Taking into account the wishes and comments </h4><br>  Our visitors, including Habr's users, noticed that not all lessons were of good quality.  Still, not every teacher, even a good lesson in the classroom, continues to work just as well on camera, so we decided to retake many lessons. <br><br><h4>  How is everything done </h4><br>  It all starts with a lesson script.  The teacher, together with our curator, works out the script, determines which illustrative and additional material to use, what to focus on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/03/a3/03a3ab36053080bb5df2172ac01f9d57.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The director tells the teacher how best to stay in front of the camera, how to gesticulate, where to put your hands, how to speak. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9d/1f/9d1f173804b61701a4c53f8dac5ce94b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We take lessons at two sites.  One is equipped in Moscow, the other in St. Petersburg, based on Lennauchfilm. <br><br>  The studio has two cameras that allow you to vary the picture, periodically changing angles.  The sound is written through the microphone-buttonhole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7c/79/7c7918a19601cdeefb7675e47de90b1f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Then we assemble the lesson, our designers draw graphics to it, add interactive features and lay out on dedicated servers for this purpose, one of which works for Russia, the other for Europe. <br><br><h4>  What's in the plans </h4><br>  To consolidate the material covered, we plan to add quizzes, tests and exercises. <br><br>  In addition, we plan to make fuller use of the capabilities of the Internet and multimedia technologies: supply the lesson with additional materials, slides, and also make the lessons non-linear, so that the student can choose the sequence of presentation of the material, use interactive footnotes, etc.  Already, you can <a href="http://interneturok.ru/video/fizika/9_klass/mehanicheskie_kolebaniya_i_volny/kolebatelnoe_dvizhenie_i_ego_harakteristiki_svobodnye_i_vynuzhdennye_kolebaniya/">see the lesson with the accompanying slide show</a> , as well as <a href="http://interneturok.ru/urok_vov/">an example of a non-linear lesson</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5a/d6/5ad6e09922dcb8c52804c67cfccc1a8b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>At the 1st stage</b> , video tutorials on all subjects of the school curriculum are created and placed in open access. <br>  Terms: 6‚Äì10 classes - 2010‚Äì2011, 1‚Äì5 classes - 2012 <br>  <b>At the 2nd stage</b> , video tutorials of a new type will be developed, fully utilizing the possibilities of non-linear material presentation. <br>  Deadline: 2011‚Äì2012 <br>  <b>At the 3rd stage,</b> we will create a school, in the curriculum of which real and virtual lessons will be combined.  On the basis of the school will begin to operate a laboratory for the development of scientific foundations of Internet teaching and a studio that implements these developments. <br><br>  We want not only to provide for the wide access all the lessons of the school curriculum, but also to give users of the resource a choice: on each topic it is planned to post lessons in several versions conducted by different teachers.  After all, it is often the case that the incomprehensible becomes clear only because the new teacher placed accents a little differently, cited alternative examples. <br><br><h4>  We need your help </h4><br>  We are not the first time publishing materials on our projects on Habr√©.  We do this for a specific purpose. <br><br>  There are many people here who can help us with critical comments and suggestions for the development of the project.  We appreciate your opinion and as far as possible we try to embody the incoming ideas. <br><br>  In addition, we expect that Habr's users will connect to our initiative.  If you know teachers who can record a video lesson - please recommend them to us. <br><br>  Not all teachers are actively using the Internet or the same e-mail.  If you are ready to help them connect with us, help them with creating slides and recording video - it will be great. <br><br>  Perhaps even one of those present can record, say, computer science, math, physics lessons? <br><br>  And, of course, we hope for help in promoting our initiative.  Tell about us teachers, parents, students. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f3/5f/f35f905c2519c2285e244ddbf1f50099.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We are open for cooperation.  If you want to take part in the project - please email us at info@univertv.ru. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/109526/">https://habr.com/ru/post/109526/</a></p>
