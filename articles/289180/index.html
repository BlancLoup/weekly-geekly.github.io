  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The story of how students overnight the site gash</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Late hour, half past twelve ...</b> <br><br>  So it turns out that we often gather with the Faith.  She is always homely and warm.  And if we can create an atmosphere in any place, then it is more difficult with the situation.  And here also budget :) <br><br>  First of all, we decided on the need to draw up a meeting schedule.  We started with timing - ending at 5 am, mandatory breaks.  Vanya remembered the Pomodoro method - everyone liked the idea, and we immediately applied it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The essence of the technique in strict implementation of the points of the algorithm: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      1. We define the task on which we will work; <br><br>  2. Set the timer for 25 minutes; <br><br>  3.Work without distractions; <br><br>  4. After 25 minutes we take a 5-minute break, even if the task is not done; <br><br>  5.If the task is completed, we get an imaginary tomato, put it in the basket; <br><br>  6.If 4 tomatoes are in the basket, empty the basket and rest for another 30 minutes; <br><br>  7. Return to step 1 or 2. <br><br>  I will not tell all the subtleties, there is enough information in the network.  I will only say beforehand that we sat there all night and felt tired only once, having forgotten to set the timer and sat over the task for almost an hour and a half.  The method is effective, we were productive.  In 5 minutes, the brain manages to switch and rest, and Vanin also recalls a couple of stale jokes. <br><br>  The next item is the organization of the work process.  I wanted transparency and control, and most importantly visualization.  At one of the project management pairs, the teacher talked about Agile and, in particular, Kanban.  The basis seemed simple, so we applied some similarity to this methodology.  Very appropriate here was a reminder board, bought by Vera in IKEA on one of her trips to Kazan, and colored stickers.  The board was divided into three parts: ‚ÄúPlan‚Äù, ‚ÄúIn Work‚Äù, ‚ÄúImplemented‚Äù. <br><br>  So  planned tasks were described and pinned up in the ‚ÄúPlan‚Äù column, at the next iteration of paragraph 3 of the Pomodoro algorithm in the ‚ÄúIn Work‚Äù column there could be no more than 4 stickers with tasks at the same time (4 - in the case when each has its own task, less - in the case of joint work on the task).  After completing the task, the responsible person outweighed the sticker in the third column.  Again, I will run ahead and say that now we are using TRELLO - XXI century AD. <br><br>  The last organizational moment is the agenda and the planned result, i.e.  aim of the meeting.  It was necessary to immediately determine the main points for discussion and the final result - we needed a specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time-limited goal.  Yes, this is a goal setting on SMART, without this item we could sit all night and be distracted by other tasks - tasks that in no way bring us closer to the main goal. <br><br>  The purpose of our meeting is accessible and readable from any device, a <a href="http://weneedsomemoney.com/">page</a> on the network with a description of the experiment and an orange button for transferring funds by 5 am the next day.  At this point we stopped and wrote in large letters on an A4 sheet.  And also formed the top-level tasks: <br><br>  1.domain; <br><br>  2. hosting; <br><br>  3.page. <br><br>  Yes, in that order.  And yes, this is error # 1.  If I had a time machine now, I would have returned that night and slapped myself with the words ‚ÄúFirst, design and content, then buying a domain and hosting.‚Äù  But that was, that was.  As a result, this led to the fact that the whole month the paid hosting was used only for internal testing of the site.  But they could use free hosting, at the first stage adequate technical support was not required. <br><br>  So, the night.  We think about the name, stopping at the 5-minute coffee breaks. <br><br>  The name for the resource is not easy to come up with.  Vera compared this process with the choice of the name of the child.  There was no experience in either one, so read techniques from articles came to the rescue.  First, they took advantage of the brainstorming with the ejection of the most delusional options.  At first it seemed funny - fooling around, but after a certain amount of time t1, the following scheme unexpectedly began to work for us: <br><br>  XXX: "What if ...% idea_with_the_frediting_bred__bSh%"? <br><br>  YYY: ‚ÄúWell, what are you doing, then it's better ...% idea_c_coef.breda_ShSh / 2%‚Äù! <br><br>  ZZZ: ‚ÄúYou both got carried away.  Much more effective% idea_c_coef.bred__bSh / 4% "! <br><br>  By the time t2, we had 3 variants of the name: <br>  1.luckytrip.com <br>  2.weneedsomemoney.com <br>  3.shutupandgiveyourmoney.com <br><br>  Each defended his point of view, which is logical and brought up since childhood.  After two ineffectual iterations of Pomodoro, we used the Six Hats of Thinking method. <br><br>  The basis of the method of Edward de Bono is the concept of parallel thinking.  As a rule, a decision is born in a clash of opinions, in debate and controversy.  With this approach, preference is often given not at all to the best of options, but to the one that was most successfully promoted in the controversy.  Six hats of thinking, in the process of solving practical problems, help to cope with three main difficulties: <br>  1. Emotions.  Instead of thinking about a decision, we often limit ourselves to an emotional reaction that predetermines our further actions; <br>  2. Confusion.  Not knowing what to do or where to start, we feel insecure; <br>  3.Putanitsy.  When we try to keep in our head a large array of information related to the task, we try to be logical, consistent and creative-minded, to be constructive, and we also make sure that the people around us are such, usually all this does not lead to anything but confusion and confusion. <br><br>  Again, more in the network.  Alternately putting on imaginary hats of different colors, we stopped at option 2. Hooray, a little victory! <br><br>  Used registrar's services REG.RU.  At that time we had a promo code with a 25% discount, so I think this is the main reason for choosing this resource. <br><br>  After registering a domain, they received a promotional code for a discount on hosting, which certainly played a role - the hosting was immediately acquired.  And it became a mistake # 2.  Enough to conduct a half-hour analysis and what we see?  Rich choice, variety of services, a lot of tariffs. <br><br>  Sms about writing off payment for hosting violated the sleepy silence.  Vera yawned, Vanya did not stop.  In anticipation of boiling water, we sat in a circle and played in "Thirty-three."  In short, participants should say one after the other all the numbers in ascending order: 1, 2, 3, etc.  to 33. <br><br>  The peculiarity lies in the fact that all numbers that end in a number 3 or are divided by a number 3 cannot be pronounced, but must be replaced with a pop.  Mistake?  Again.  By the time of the successful completion of the quest, the teapot was naturally cooled.  But we have achieved the main thing - we were again vigorous, ready to work, more precisely, to coding. <br><br>  One thing was clear from our SMART goal, we need adaptability.  And given the lack of a designer in the company, tight deadlines and scalability in the future, we agreed on the template Bootstrap.  Mistake?  No, this time - success # 1. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSimple and easily customizable HTML, CSS, and Javascript tools‚Äù, ‚ÄúCreated by botans for nerds‚Äù, ‚ÄúFor everyone and for everything‚Äù - read the headings on the main page.  We bought, we are satisfied. <br><br>  <b>I summarize</b> <br><br>  Turnkey website in just 7 hours or 21 man hours.  I think we could have done it even faster if we all listed in the Gantt Chart.  But as you know, good ideas come apostles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289180/</a></p>
