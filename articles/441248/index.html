  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russia ranked 9th in the global SSL rating, ahead of China, Denmark and Switzerland</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The information security (IS) market has increased rapidly over the past few years.  Companies began to invest more in cyber security, to conclude more contracts.  The global market for goods and services in the field of digital security is growing, in particular, the SSL industry.  In the global market, the number of sites that have switched to a secure HTTPS connection has increased by an average of 2 times over the past year.  This dynamic applies to both developed and many developing countries. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9m/0m/mt/9m0mmt_feejouz3c3ugt6boqpbu.jpeg"><br>  The number of SSL certificates by country (according to the company Netcraft).  Data is given without self-signed certificates. <br><br>  The last five years, the primacy of the number of sites protected by SSL, keep North America, Western Europe and Japan.  This is due to the historically leading role that IS occupies in these countries, as well as the adoption of RSA / SHA cryptographic algorithms as national ones, which allows adhering to standards to introduce new information security products faster than in countries that have their own cryptographic standards and vague legal regulations in the use of SSL, as, for example, in Russia, where there are GOST cryptographic algorithms.

      However, Russia made a strong breakthrough towards safe traffic: since 2017, the number of protected sites with certificates has increased 3 times.  Today, Russia is ranked 9th in the world rankings, leaving behind not only South Africa and Denmark, but also China, Poland, Switzerland. <br><br>  <i>Features of the Russian SSL certificate market</i> <br><br>  The breakthrough jump of the Russian SSL market was facilitated not only by the appearance on it of various certification centers, but also by special programs.  For example, starting in 2015, REG.RU and GlobalSign launched the issuance of SSL certificates for 1 year complete with a domain or hosting as part of the SSL popularization program.  REG.RU clients have an opportunity to use a valid SSL certificate for free and test it in practice.  Since the work of the program issued more than 300 thousand certificates. <br><br>  According to the analytical resource StatOnline.ru, in January 2019, 896 thousand SSL certificates were active in the .RU zone, and 98 thousand RF certificates were included in the RF domain, including self-signed ones.  Moreover, the number of valid SSL significantly exceeds the number of invalid - 880 thousand certificates issued for domains in the zone .RU and.. <br><br>  In Russia today there are 3 leaders among certification centers for the number of SSL released in .RU: Let's Encrypt, COMODO CA Limited and GlobalSign.  A significant advantage to Let's Encrypt is due to the ability to receive free SSL certificates for up to 90 days in this CA. <br><br>  In .RU most certificates with a validity of less than a year (80%) and 1 year (18%).  The most popular format for using a single SSL certificate for a single domain.  But multi-domain certificates (SAN) are also in demand. <br><br>  In the regions of Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America, the growth of the SSL market share is low, but stable.  This allows us to say with certainty that the positive trend of the transition of sites to HTTPS around the world will continue in the coming years. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe can mention several changes that have occurred in the SSL industry in recent years and speak in favor of continuing to increase the share of secure sites: this is the rise in the position of HTTPS sites in Google‚Äôs search results, marking HTTP sites as unsafe in Chrome, increasing the demand for OV- and EV-level certificates, reducing the maximum validity of SSL certificates from 3 to 2 years, as well as the transition from the outdated SHA-1 hash cryptographic algorithm to SHA-2, ‚Äùsays Dmitry Ryzhikov, GMO Executive Director GlobalSign Russia. <br><br>  ‚ÄúToday, in the era of digitalization of the economy and the transition to the online prevailing part of goods and services, it is especially important to take care of the security of the Internet project and its customers.  SSL certificate is an integral element of commercial projects on the Web.  We and our partner, the oldest <a href="http://www.globalsign.com/ru-ru/">certification center GlobalSign</a> , will continue to provide an accessible tool for everyone in the Russian market, including an SSL certificate for one year complete with hosting or a domain, ‚Äùsays REG.RU CEO Alexei Korolyuk. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441248/</a></p>
