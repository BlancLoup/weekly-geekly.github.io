We did not notice how more than 3 years have passed since the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/readyscript/blog/228169/">previous publication</a> , as we enthusiastically developed the capabilities of <a href="https://readyscript.ru/">our eCommerce platform</a> and related services.  In this article we will explain what ReadyScript offers today to users and developers, what tasks can be solved with its help. <br><br>  During this time, our product has grown to the third major version, has got an adaptive administrative panel, integration with online cash registers, mobile applications for couriers and administrators, mobile applications for customers, Desktop applications for Windows and OSx, a framework for simple creation of external API, marketplace with a lot modules, as well as a whole ecosystem for working with users and developers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/py/go/yq/pygoyqmjk3p-e5gtb8nwdd7woci.jpeg">

      Even during this time, we have released the fourth, most functional edition of Megastore, which includes a built-in three-component security module, a CDN, a branch network module, as well as advanced statistics. <br><br>  We will tell more about all this under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Administrative panel</b> - it is now fully adaptive for mobile devices, including smartphones.  In it, you can not only view information, but also fully work with information: create, search, modify various objects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0l/tl/wf/0ltlwfvu5rotbrdch761m3omc24.png"><br><br>  The ideas that inspired us when developing a new design were described in detail in <a href="http://cases.cmsmagazine.ru/cases/3907/">our case</a> study on the administrative panel. <br><br>  We have refined the architecture of the platform for working with online cash registers, we have a new section ‚ÄúChecks‚Äù, in which information on fiscalization of transactions is visible.  Emboss checks can "cash modules".  We added support for one of ATOL ONLINE‚Äôs most popular ‚Äúcash register modules‚Äù to our product distribution kits, starting with the Market edition, and also refined the standard Yandex.Cash modules, Robokassa for transferring fiscal data. <br><br>  <b>Marketplace</b> <br><br>  We have a store add-ons, with which you can quickly extend the functionality of an online store.  It has integration with payment aggregators, delivery services, CRM-systems, modules for organizing bonus and discount programs, trigger mailings, rules for the basket, as well as many other useful modules. <br><br>  We strongly assist developers in the promotion of add-ons.  For example, all users in the administrative panel have a widget ‚ÄúUseful modules from the Marketplace‚Äù, and all the themes from the marketplace are immediately visible in the general dialog of the choice of themes in the system.  We also periodically conduct promotions for certain categories of modules in the marketplace and inform users about this. <br><br>  Packing a module for placement in the marketplace is easy, we have a <a href="https://readyscript.ru/dev-manual/dev_marketplace.html">special manual for this</a> .  Due to favorable conditions and a simple mechanism for placing modules, developers can repeatedly sell once written code. <br><br>  <b>Antivirus in "Megastore"</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kr/o-/uz/kro-uzgpa3aoslprlddecbtx7ue.jpeg"><br><br>  We have provided our most functional edition with a three-component security module, which includes: <br><br><ul><li>  File integrity control component.  The hashes of all distribution files are compared in our endless loop with our benchmarks.  In case of differences, the system signals this, showing exactly what changes in which file were detected.  Further in 1 click you can restore the file to its original state. </li><li>  Component of proactive protection.  Controls all parameters included in the script, comparing them with malicious templates.  When malicious activity is detected, the administrator receives a notification and detailed information about the source and type of attack.  There is an option to automatically block the IP addresses from which the attack is coming. <br><br>  The component also "knows" how to detect and block attacks with frequency requests from a single IP.  The component calculates the interval and the number of requests and, in the presence of abnormal activity, can automatically block the IP address and / or inform the administrator about what is happening. </li><li>  Component Antivirus.  Checks in an infinite loop all the files of the site for the presence of viruses in them. </li></ul><br>  The infinite loop runs in the background (via cron-tasks), the files are checked in chunks so as not to create additional load on the server. <br><br>  The security module provides the administrator with important information about external activity directed towards his site, greatly complicates the life of parsers and vulnerability scanners (due to blocking IP, from which frequency requests are coming), and also automatically copes with simple attacks. <br><br>  <b>Branch network in "Megastore"</b> <br><br>  We have prepared a convenient abstract model for stores with a branch network.  Such stores have a choice of a city or a store in the header of the site.  This choice affects the display of short contacts (phone number, address) on all pages, a unique link to a full-scale contact page, a display of the availability of goods in the warehouses of only the selected region and in some cases also affects the type of prices. <br><br>  This module does not spoil the SEO site map, since on the site from the new pages only personal contact pages for each city appear in the form of: <br><br> <code>/contacts/ /</code> <br> <br>  <b>Framework for creating external APIs</b> <br><br>  To develop Desktop and mobile applications, we needed comfortable JSON APIs on the side of the ReadyScript platform.  We have formed general API requirements: <br><br><ol><li>  The API must be extremely flexible, it must be extended with the help of third-party modules. </li><li>  It should be as self-documenting as possible, that is, the documentation should be built automatically on a specific URL in the context of versions, and even in several languages, and the system should maximally pull data types, default values, method descriptions directly from the code, or rather from the phpDoc sections code. </li><li>  It should be possible to differentiate access rights to API methods for different applications, as well as for different users of applications. </li></ol><br>  This approach to the API allowed us to efficiently organize the work of independent frontend developers and backend specialists.  A backend programmer will need to write more code than documentation, and this will certainly increase development speed. <br><br>  As a result, we developed a set of base classes, as well as a ready-made module for building documentation in ReadyScript, which allows you to quickly add methods to the external API. <br>  You can read more about how this all works in <a href="https://readyscript.ru/dev-manual/dev_external_api.html">our documentation for building external APIs</a> . <br><br>  <b>Mobile applications for administrators and couriers</b> <br><br>  Platforms for online stores have long outgrown the role of cashiers; now they manage various business processes within the company.  When there is a ready API, it's time to work on mobile applications, we thought and created our first application for couriers and administrators for iOS and Android. <br><br>  Administrators using the application can view sales statistics, view orders, assign couriers for delivery, edit some order fields, see the delivery address on the map, receive push notifications about orders. <br><br>  Couriers do not have access to sales statistics and ‚Äúreceive‚Äù only those orders that are assigned to them.  The rest of the functionality is similar to the administrator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8o/0q/we/8o0qwelvywi6phrmeeamttava5e.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Mobile applications for customers (SaaS)</b> <br><br>  After we mastered the competence of developing mobile applications, we could not stop and realized that we can now offer ready-made client eCommerce mobile application to all our clients for iOS and Android.  We were often asked about it by the owners of online stores who wanted to offer their customers the maximum service for repeat purchases. <br><br>  Having spent a year on development, we launched the SaaS rental service for ready-made, full-featured client mobile applications for online stores on our platform. <br><br>  The application turned out very functional, fast and, of course, perfectly integrated with our platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mx/1o/m8/mx1om8lqsl7gg6u-jt_fuhl54tu.png"><br><br>  So that users can evaluate how their future application will look like, we developed a special DEMO <b>RS Mobile</b> application in the <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/rs-mobile/id1239797895">AppStore</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.readyscript.mobilesiteapp">GooglePlay</a> , which can connect via the API with a customer store and show all the functions of the future application in real time. <br><br>  For end users, we provide services in the form of SaaS, for studios owning the development competence on IonicFramework, we are ready to provide a packaged mobile application solution with licensing for each client. <br><br>  We have identified a new service in a separate brand ReadyScript Mobile.  In the near future we will make a detailed review article about it. <br><br>  <b>Desktop notification application</b> <br><br>  Online trading today requires an instant response to any customer requests, as well as orders.  Especially for this, we mastered the stack of Electron.js + Angular + node.js and implemented a cross-platform Desktop notification application. <br><br>  The application is able to hang in the tray and inform about events that occurred in the online store.  The application stores the history of notifications in its own database, and is also able to re-notify about the event until it is viewed. <br><br>  We gave developers the opportunity to develop their own notifications for the Desktop application.  This can solve a huge pool of custom tasks that are associated with instant notification of staff. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q3/v1/uk/q3v1uku8byfaecp_onq_tg_atqm.png"><br><br>  <b>What tasks can be solved using ReadyScript?</b> <br><br>  A wide base functionality together with the possibilities of extending this functionality through third-party modules allows building projects of any complexity on ReadyScript eCommerce. <br><br>  ReadyScript is an extensive stack of technologies and software products with which you can run a full-scale online store, a convenient and intuitive mobile application for iOS and Android, arrange the work of couriers using an appropriate mobile application, and adjust the work of managers using auxiliary Desktop applications with notifications. <br><br>  <b>Ecosystem around the product</b> <br><br>  A forum, Helpdesk, video tutorials, documentation for users and developers, an online consultant, a hotline for support, a tool for holding tenders and finding developers - this is all we have right now. <br><br>  The ReadyScript platform is part of a large ReadyScript service, in which all components interact with each other, and the administrative panel of the online store is an aggregator of all information. <br><br>  <b>Work with partners</b> <br><br>  We have developed <a href="https://readyscript.ru/partners/">six types of</a> affiliate programs, two of which will be of particular interest to developers and specialists in the Web. <br><br><ol><li>  Affiliate program for professionals.  Provides a discount of up to 50% on our products, the possibility of participating in tenders for the development, as well as many other bonuses. </li><li>  Affiliate program for representatives in the region.  It provides for the possibility of placing on the page of our contacts with the right to sell our products according to an agent scheme in your region. </li></ol><br>  We invite web developers to our marketplace separately.  The competition in it is not too high, and the demand is already high enough, it can be seen in our <a href="https://helpdesk.readyscript.ru/wish/all/">service of wishes</a> . <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  In recent years, we have done a lot of work so that ReadyScript can be used as a studio standard for any eCommerce projects. <br><br>  Each business is unique, so we try to make the web studio or private developer get the maximum number of functions out of the box, and developing the remaining functionality for the client is quick and convenient. <br><br>  If the studio has any questions, we have come up with a number of convenient support tools, including free VIP support (from the partner‚Äôs office), within which we dive into the partner‚Äôs task and show the optimal solution through the ReadyScript platform. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/342716/">https://habr.com/ru/post/342716/</a></p>
