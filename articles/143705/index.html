  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Replacing WiMAX devices with LTE devices</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In February, YOTA announced the switch in April in Moscow from WiMAX to LTE technology.  We notified clients several times through all available channels for us: using personal calls, automatic page in the browser, in the personal account, by SMS, by e-mail.  The subscriber every time when accessing the Internet hit the page that had information about the need to get a new device due to the fact that on May 10, the WiMAX network would stop working. <br><br>  On May 10, 240,000 devices were issued in Moscow, which is 80% of the active user base.  Therefore, we postponed the launch date of LTE in Moscow to May 10, and extended the time to receive new devices until May 20.  There were also significantly strengthened three points of issuance of devices - in the shopping center "Atrium", the shopping center "Airport", the shopping center "Kaluzhsky" - and organized the issuance of devices in the YOTA office on ul.  Rusakovskaya, 13. On the day of network switching, May 10, at the Atrium, the average waiting time was 10-15 minutes.  For this day we gave out 12 thousand devices.  As a result, there are 20 thousand outstanding orders. <br><br>  In Moscow, YOTA issued 52.7% of devices through YOTA sales points, 15.3% came from Svyaznoy, 32% were delivered by couriers.  We worked with seven courier companies, but, unfortunately, not all of them were able to restructure their work in such a way as to provide us with the necessary paperwork process.  Opportunities for courier services for daily delivery were limited, and therefore unpredictable delays occurred.  We apologize. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  An active user of YOTA, who has already placed an order, can get a new device in 150 Svyaznoy stores and at YOTA sales points.  Users who have not yet placed an order can pre-order before May 20 - and we will execute it in early June.  You can buy devices in the networks of our partners - Svyaznoy and ION.  And from May 14 - in Euroset.

      Many of our customers rightly point out in the comments that it is impossible to reach technical support.  Please treat this with understanding.  The capacity of the contact center at the time of technology change increased five times, only from April 27 to May 10, 220 thousand calls were recorded, but the lines are loaded so that sometimes the beeps do not even start.  <b>For all YOTA users in Moscow, an additional multichannel contact center number is now available: + 7-495-640-64-00</b> .  If you can not get through, write in the comments about all the problems that you encounter, we will help you. <br><br>  In the coming days there will still be short-term difficulties with access to the network.  This is associated with round-the-clock technical work.  We did not find an analogue to such a process, the experience of switching to another technology in one night does not exist in the world.  But there was no other way to switch the network, since WiMAX worked on the same frequencies as LTE now. <br><br>  Speedtest is already running speed tests on the LTE network.  The average throughput rate per sector of the base station has doubled, only 6% of the sectors are overloaded.  1256 stations are already operating in Moscow. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143705/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143705/</a></p>
