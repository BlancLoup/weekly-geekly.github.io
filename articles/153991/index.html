Analysts predict that for the current year about 1 million of such devices will be sold, which is 2-3 times more than last year.  Agree impressive numbers.  Today we will talk about the Prestigio Roadrunner 500 model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b3c/430/248/b3c430248dbe373c1c45b05b1d578ca3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Prestigio Roadrunner 500 is made in the "monoblock" form factor, that is, the screen is not folding, it is built into the main body.  Although the part of the device in which the lens is located is attached to another part with the help of a hinge.  This is necessary for more convenient "aiming" the lens on the road.  For the same serves as a screen with a diagonal of 2 inches.  On it you can view the content captured by the device. <br><br>  Prestigio Roadrunner 500 is equipped with a 5 megapixel camera (based on CMOS-matrix), which provides shooting in Full HD 1080p format, the maximum frequency in this mode reaches 30 frames per second.  If you set the resolution to 848 by 480, then the frequency will be equal to 60 frames per second.  By the way, in this model, interpolation (software expansion of the resolution to a higher one) does not apply, that is, Full HD 1080p format is real. <br>  The device has a 1000 mAh battery, which ensures autonomous operation of the recorder for approximately two and a half hours.  This suggests that, if desired, you can use the Prestigio Roadrunner 500 as a portable camera.  Interestingly, the device is equipped with a Nokia-compatible battery, so you can buy a couple more batteries in stock and change them during operation.  The gadget is also equipped with a convenient and high-quality suction cup holder.  Sections of the holder are securely fixed, the device does not hang out.  At the same time, you can always, without problems, say, turn the camera into the cabin or quickly pull the recorder out of the mount. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e3f/066/472/e3f0664723bd2e49d554b059831c25bc.jpg"><br><br>  Video examples <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/8knATBg_f1k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj079E-SyTleuxf-ZW8XxNF2gwXTw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/6GoNABrjPdc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh21MEk980W3osnshSWTnT4HojnbA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <i>Videos taken from the network</i> <br><br>  The angle of view of the camera is 120 degrees - this is the standard for modern DVRs.  In fact, this angle can be called the ‚Äúgolden mean‚Äù: if it is less, the side edges of the curb will not fall into the frame, if it is more, the picture will be curved (the fish eye effect).  In general, the image quality is very good, this is also facilitated by the applied image stabilization technology EIS Anti-shake.  We also note that with the help of Prestigio Roadrunner 500 you can take photos with a maximum resolution of 12 megapixels.  However, in this case the already mentioned interpolation will be used, since the gadget is equipped with a 5-megapixel camera. <br><br>  In order to avoid unexpected filling of the memory card and, accordingly, stopping the recording, the Prestigio Roadrunner 500 has a loop recording function.  In other words, when filling a memory card, new fragments will be recorded over the old ones (the date and time is indicated in the file name).  Overwriting will begin with the file recorded first.  In the settings you can set the duration of the fragments: 5, 10 or 15 minutes.  In addition, the cyclic recording can be completely disabled.  Also in the settings you can set whether the date and time will be displayed on the video. <br><br>  It is also important that Prestigio Roadrunner 500 records overlapping fragments.  That is, approximately 1 second of the same video is present at the end of one video and the beginning of another.  This is important, as in many low-cost recorder models, 1 to 5 seconds of video between the fragments is lost.  To make it clearer, let's say that a car that moves at a speed of 60 km / h, passes about 80 meters in 5 seconds.  Agree, during this time anything can happen.  It will be a shame if exactly this moment will not be captured on video.  All recorded information is stored on a memory card, the device does not have its own memory.  The device supports SD cards up to 32 GB. <br><br>  Prestigio Roadrunner 500 is equipped with a built-in motion sensor (not to be confused with the G-sensor).  It is necessary for pictures in the parking mode, when the recorder reacts to sound or movement near the car parked and automatically takes several pictures in a row.  You can also customize the beginning of the video on the motion sensor.  The device has a LED-backlight.  It is designed to illuminate nearby objects.  Of course, road users who are several meters away from the receptionist are unlikely to be able to photograph in the dark with it.  But, for example, the face of the traffic police inspector who approached the driver's door would be nice.  For forgetful or lazy drivers, there is a function to start recording when the engine starts and stop it after you turn off the engine (in the settings you can set the delay time). <br><br>  Prestigio Roadrunner 500 has a fairly simple and convenient menu.  Even a person who is not particularly "friendly" with equipment can easily figure it out.  On the side of the device are the keys for quick access to the key functions of the device, so you do not have to wander around the menu for a long time to find what you need right now. <br>  The Prestigio Roadrunner 500 package includes everything you need and even more: the recorder itself, suction mount on the windshield, Nokia-compatible battery (BL-5C), HDMI cable (by the way, this accessory comes with recorders not so often) , USB cable, AV cable (tulip), cigarette lighter charger, carrying case, instruction manual and warranty card.  We also note a very nice package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c8a/c59/494/c8ac59494e8971160a83dac5d7beed5b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/853/a4e/008/853a4e00871f0e7fe0dab9909232c55c.jpg"><br><br>  Results  Prestigio Roadrunner 500 made a pleasant impression.  The device is a worthy representative of the class "car DVR."  In addition, the gadget is relatively inexpensive - less than 5,000 rubles.  This is a good price for a model that writes video in Full HD 1080p.  Well, the final touch is a two-year international guarantee: compare with the one-year local, which is standard provided by almost all manufacturers. <br><br>  PS Added a video in the mode of evening-night shooting. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ly9P14d2c0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjlGovsHJlvgcHULw0yjObIHzytFQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153991/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153991/</a></p>
