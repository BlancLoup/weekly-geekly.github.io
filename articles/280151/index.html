  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Extreme developer: how to relax programmers Veeam</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are many ways to escape from work.  The variety of entertainment services offered is sometimes confusing.  One like simple and affordable leisure activities like cinema and exhibitions, others like something more active and exciting. <br><br>  There is an opinion that programmers - people are by their nature calm and low-active - are mostly keen on going to bars and rarely barbecues in nature.  In rebuttal, we present you a selection of the most active and extreme hobbies among the developers of Veeam Software. <br><br>  Like many, our programmers are ‚Äúsick‚Äù with their work.  If you walk around the office on a weekday at 8 pm, few of them will be out of work.  The guys create a world-class product, their work requires maximum attentiveness and responsibility.  We chose four colleagues who were asked to talk about how they organized their time off.

It does not matter whether there are problems or, conversely, success in work, it is useful to stop thinking about it for a while, reboot. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Abdullaev:</b> <br>  To have a hobby is to be open, to be in the world, to be interested, to love, to live!  More importantly, not just a hobby, but to have interests other than work :) <br><br><h4>  About the most valuable </h4><br>  <b>Maxim Astakhov:</b> <br>  Bike tours give me an incredible sense of freedom.  No other mode of transport gives such a feeling. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/625/2a0/f79/6252a0f79f6542fe9a925ed254746a07.jpg" width="714" height="400"></div><br>  <i>Maxim Astakhov: Traveling on a bicycle, I am not tied to tickets, nor to fuel, nor to parking lots, nor to train stations, nor to cities.</i>  <i>With some experience and preparation, I am not even attached to the roads.</i> <br><br>  <b>Nikolai Kobzarev:</b> <br>  I like the places I visit on the rafting.  How else would I find myself in the most beautiful canyons or somewhere on the island in the middle of the river? <br><br>  Interesting people you meet in kayaking.  Their attitude to difficulties, injuries, desire to help each other.  Even when the danger is minimal, few people train on the water alone - so that just in case there is a comrade ready to help.  You get very close to these people. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/980/95f/ddd/98095fddd46747288d24964751a4b81c.jpg" width="606" height="400"></div><br>  <i>Nikolai Kobzarev: Stormy water attracts me the most.</i>  <i>When you try not to fight the flow, but use it for your own purposes.</i>  <i>I like that completely captures the current moment when surfing on a wave or rafting on the river.</i> <br><br>  <b>Alexander Baranov:</b> <br>  Nothing brings people closer together than joint preparation for going out to the water.  Personally, I really like the spring pre-season repair of the yacht, and the incomparable sensations when you ennoble the ship with your own hands with the great invention of mankind - a grinder. <br><br>  Repair is a good opportunity to rest your head and work with your hands, while filling your lungs with fresh spring sea air. <br><br>  It is communication, joint work and rest, perhaps, that are the brightest and most interesting moments of yachting.  And, of course, sea trips rest on the top of my personal charts of pleasure from this hobby. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eaa/cdb/816/eaacdb816e3d488295be1542a57ffebc.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Central River Yacht Club, August 2015.</i> <br><cut><br><h4>  About the benefits of the case </h4><br>  <b>Alexander Abdullaev:</b> <br>  Physical culture and sport leave their mark on life and outside the hall.  During classes, we constantly overcome difficulties - this is the basis of sport :) It is precisely overcoming difficulties that teaches a person to overcome difficulties, however simple that may sound.  In the gym, you can set yourself different goals: from small ones (to pull up on 1 times more) to large ones (to win the competitions) and even the biggest ones (to win the city cup, for example).  The ability to set goals, plan, achieve them, overcome difficulties, and, above all, my own weakness and fear, brings me great health, gives confidence in all aspects of life, including at work. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Baranov:</b> <br>  Yachting lessons are an extremely useful thing: at sundown sunset, I want to take a break from rest, so that on Monday I happily go to work! <br><br>  <b>Maxim Astakhov:</b> <br>  My hobby is directly related to regular workouts, cycling, going to the gym and other physical training.  All this, in turn, gives a practical understanding of what discipline and responsibility are, an adequate assessment of one‚Äôs own capabilities and preparation.  In my opinion, these are extremely important skills in any activity. <br><br><br><h4>  About success </h4><br>  <b>Nikolai Kobzarev:</b> <br>  My main successes are trips, new countries, interesting places, meeting new people.  For me, kayaking is, above all, fun on the water and rest, after which you want to return to work again. <br><br>  Uganda has become the most memorable trip for me.  Partly because of the big waves, which in themselves bring a lot of emotion, and also because I was first in the very center of the African continent! <br><br>  As a rule, on such trips we live in non-touristic places, so we have the opportunity to fully enjoy the country: see how the locals live in villages, see nature and beauty. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eeb/30d/776/eeb30d776fa2484381b04cbbefe43a24.jpg" width="606" height="400"></div><br>  <i>Nikolai Kobzarev: It all began with trips around the Leningrad Region: Losevo, Karelia, and also Lieksa in Finland.</i> <br><br>  <b>Alexander Abdullaev:</b> <br>  In the third grade, I became the champion of the school on pull-ups - pulled up 35 times.  This was my first public victory!  I became a headman - in parallel with sporting success, I was ‚Äúmathematician‚Äù.  Physical education and mathematics were my favorite subjects. <br><br>  Recall Pythagoras - was a smart man, is not it?  But he was also the champion of the Olympic Games!  This is to confirm the physiological aspect.  Sports activities help mental activity.  This is mental activity, only in its other manifestation.  In short, systematic physical training helped me to become an excellent student :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd0/c3d/7e1/bd0c3d7e1e5649a9b2a1509a8c7adfcd.jpg" width="350" height="350"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b97/79e/5d9/b9779e5d95f845b08b2169534cc1245b.jpg" width="549" height="350"><br>  <i>Alexander Abdullaev: Now I have a lot of awards, diplomas, medals, cups <s>and bruises</s> .</i>  <i>There are 2nd places, there is 1st place for various sports competitions of a small scale.</i> <br><br>  <b>Maxim Astakhov:</b> <br>  Considering that my hobby is directly related to the number of vacation days available to me, I managed to visit many places.  I rode across Russia, especially in the north-west: Karelia, Arkhangelsk, Vologda regions, Komi Republic, Kostroma region, Novgorod region.  Naturally (as a resident of St. Petersburg), very often and often in Finland. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/285/0b1/525/2850b1525a824615a4abaa6c40118959.jpg" width="606" height="400"></div><br>  <i>Maxim Astakhov: While cycling, I visited many European countries: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Italy ... in general, all in which there are the Alps.</i> <br><br>  <b>Alexander Baranov:</b> <br>  I used to have the fear of the sea, which, as it is easy to guess, passed with time. <br>  In June 2015, which was more like October, we went hiking on the route St. Petersburg-Khaapasari-Helsinki-Tallinn-Kotka-Haapasari-St. Petersburg.  A full set of weather conditions was caught: a very fresh wind with the excitement of the sea, and thick fog, and complete calm with almost zero speed.  Fear has been transformed from an animal into a controlled one. <br><br>  In the campaign, I first found myself in Finnish skerries: a phenomenon, though extremely picturesque, but just as dangerous for navigation. <br><br>  I especially remember the way back on Haapasari-Kronstadt shoulder.  The Finnish Border Guard is located in Haapasari and the Russian one in Kronstadt.  The distance between them is 76 nautical miles (about 141 km). At sunset we reached Sommers Island, on which the Russian border garrison is located.  In the conditions of complete calm, we could see a stunning picture of imagination: a crimson horizon, absolute silence, broken only by the sound of propellers that reach for miles.  After 6 hours, the clear sky was replaced by a thick, viscous fog, moreover in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe anchorage of the Krasnogorsk raid (near Kronstadt).  And the yacht, like a hedgehog in the fog, made its way through the structure of dry cargo and container ships, capable of moving at any time from the place at the command of the dispatcher.  Animal fear returned when a container ship emerged from the fog in two cables from the yacht (almost four hundred meters).  The experience of our captain helped me greatly. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee7/89d/736/ee789d7367394768886c12aee82f9955.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Svartholm, Finland.</i>  <i>June 2015.</i> <br><br><h4>  About goals and plans </h4><br>  <b>Alexander Abdullaev:</b> <br>  I continue to develop in my hobby for sports, and, despite the fact that I have been fond of it all my life, I still have a lot to learn, learn, test.  Now I am studying at the 3rd year at the University.  P.F.  Lesgaft.  So, in the nearest future - to pass the session, graduate from the university and get a second higher education, this time in the field of sports.  Now I am also preparing for the NWFD Powerlifting Championship according to AWPC / WPC, which will be held in St. Petersburg from April 7 to 10. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea8/d81/fc5/ea8d81fc595c422ab3f0db279fcab623.jpg" width="235" height="400"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/064/246/332/06424633293d41cb969de3e03852cbbc.jpg" width="601" height="400"><br>  <i>Alexander Abdullaev: Muscular activity is primarily a brain activity.</i>  <i>Muscles will never contract without an electrical signal.</i>  <i>The signal produces the brain.</i>  <i>The stronger the brain, the stronger the contraction of the muscle.</i> <br><br>  <b>Maxim Astakhov:</b> <br>  Every new journey is a new frontier.  Another level of difficulty and curiosity.  While they surrender to me one by one.  There were, of course, failures, including serious injuries.  Fortunately, every time I managed to fully recover.  I think the next stage for me should be a visit to the Himalayas and, of course, overcoming the Khardung-La pass. <br><br>  <b>Nikolai Kobzarev:</b> <br>  I have no competition goals.  Participate in them, perhaps I will get together.  But the result for me is not the main thing.  Of course, I want to develop and improve skills and skills, but I try to take it easier. <br><br>  Rather, I make plans to expand the geography of my kayaking trips.  I want, for example, to go to Canada to ride the famous "big waves", and also on a rafting trip to Norway and Nepal. <br><br><h4>  About confusion </h4><br>  <b>Alexander Abdullaev:</b> <br>  Throughout my training history, I tore my pants 4 times.  And they always diverged in the same place (not difficult to guess).  It was when doing squats, then when doing deadlifts, and, once, on the wheel (a big tire that needs to be turned over is one of the stations in a circular training session).  Tear your pants - and what to do?  The training is not finished, so you walk (or run) with your pants torn behind, trying not to turn your back on people :) Therefore, my advice to you is: choose the right clothes, depending on what you plan to practice. <br><br><h4>  On the aesthetics of travel </h4><br>  <b>Maxim Astakhov:</b> <br>  After a few hours in the saddle, in the forty-centigrade heat, crossing the plain in northern Italy, where there are not even bushes - only arable land, you unexpectedly drive into a small town where in the ice cream shop a smiling Italian in a white hat tells you "Bon Jorno!". <br><br>  Approaching the top of the next pass in the Kotsk Alps, you meet the French cyclists rushing towards you.  Seeing your face exhausted by the ascent, they smile and shout to you, ‚ÄúCourage!  Courage! ". <br><br>  At such moments you feel like a truly happy person! <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  While we were collecting interviews for this article, many colleagues appeared before us in a new, unexpected light.  It turned out that a huge number of developers Veeam in his spare time enjoys a completely different and unusual hobby.  For example: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f0/9d7/200/5f09d7200f9a4a9d9a8487de8d15de5c.jpg" width="579" height="400"></div><br>  <b>Ian Dimant</b> , quality engineer, <br>  more than 4 years old is interested in motor sports. <br>  Her dream is to go on a motorcycle tour in Europe. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2eb/0b6/4ca/2eb0b64ca76d41868df6bd79dc4f109e.jpg" width="400" height="600"></div><br>  <b>Daria Senishina</b> , developer of the Setup team, <br>  more than a year engaged in gymnastics on the tapes. <br>  ‚Äú <i>I'm just sure that you can learn to fly.</i>  <i>Of course, it is not sweet to plop on the ground, but you don‚Äôt have to start immediately from a great height</i> . ";) (C) <br><br>  There were so many people who wanted to tell about their hobbies that all the answers did not fit in one article.  Therefore, wait for the second part of the story soon! <br><br>  We always welcome new people in the team, so if you, like our heroes, are not afraid of difficulties, join!  Moreover, we are now <a href="https://careers.veeam.ru/departments/development">looking for developers</a> ! </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/280151/">https://habr.com/ru/post/280151/</a></p>
