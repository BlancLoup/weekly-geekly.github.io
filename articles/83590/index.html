Nowhere call</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  "They again took up their own!" <br>  It looks like the old school spammers do not give up and go to a new level.  Or they came out a long time ago, but I was covered just now. <br>  In general, the following case, a call with an unspecified number (Private) arrives on the mobile, probably from Skype.  At that end, a peppy voice in English begins to be introduced, calls my name and company.  I sometimes get called on the case by various foreign representatives, but considering that the call found me in the middle of the street and it‚Äôs impossible to hear anything normally, I ask you to call back another time and set a time. <br><br>  At the appointed time I receive the call again. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The girl seems to be an employee of a company located in Tokyo, says she received good recommendations about me, and decided to offer cooperation.  As a result, it all comes down to the fact that they offer me to take part in the purchase of shares of a company that, according to them, will literally rise almost 700% in a day on the stock exchange thanks to the latest development. <br>  I distinguish representatives of the ‚Äúfamous Canadian company‚Äù per kilometer, but I had some free time and decided to listen.  At first, I was eagerly convinced that they were a respected and reliable company, then that their offer was very limited and the chance to miss out was equivalent to throwing a wad of money in the trash bin.  Then went the classics of the genre.  I especially smiled at the offer to buy 2000 shares for only $ 57,000 in a telephone conversation. <br><br>  In short, I am breaking off the girl at the most interesting moment and I ask you to tell where did you get the number from and where did you decide to call me?  She hesitates at this and realizing that the case is breaking down, makes an attempt to ‚Äúread‚Äù a piece of her previous monologue.  In the end, they promise to ‚Äúgive me a shot‚Äù on soap too, which of course pleases me ...

      Oddly enough, google it by no have the name of the company ‚ÄúSource One International‚Äù and also what they wanted to do - some biotechnological company ‚ÄúDendreon Corp‚Äù.  Special mention of the scam did not notice.  And the domain name has been registered for a very long time.  So, if anyone needs it, go, I think they still have a lot of promotions :) <br><br>  Summing up, I would like to say that automated scanners are not asleep and databases with detailed information are available to anyone.  And this is considering that I registered my personal mobile only for participation in some exhibitions.  So it looks like confidentiality is unreal now and you will have to periodically listen to incoming calls as well, filtering real offers from mobile spam. <br><br>  I wonder when there will be antispam call filters? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83590/</a></p>
