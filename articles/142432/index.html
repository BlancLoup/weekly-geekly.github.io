In fact, he taught at the same time Rails and technical English.

      And now, exactly two years ago, I got the idea that such transfers can be useful not only for me, and I decided to make a website based on them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The first version of the site worked on Joomla, where I gradually posted translations of various Rails 2.3 guides.  Ideas that need to somehow maintain the relevance of translations, it did not occur to me at that time, therefore I took as a basis a piece of manuals in html, pulled from the office.  site, and paragraphs it translated and saved through the admin Joomla. <br><br>  At the end of the summer of 2010, Rails 3.0 came out, and then I realized that some of the already translated became irrelevant, which reduced the relevance of all manuals in general.  Well, I think, once got involved, you need to continue what was started, moved everything that exists into the section dedicated to 2.3, and began (by eye!) To look for what was remembered in the 3.0 manuals compared to 2.3. <br><br>  And then work appeared that was not related to Ruby, and I left the site for half a year.  These six months were enough for me to understand that my soul wants to chop, and not something else.  In addition, for the first time I talked live with real rubists at <a href="http://devmeetups.ru/">Krasnoyarsk Devmitapses</a> (who, by the way, also soon turns 1 year old). <br><br>  In general, I became determined to do everything ‚Äúgrown-up‚Äù.  First of all, I wrote a simple application on Rails, where I began to transfer translations, updating them for the pending version 3.1 and linking them to revisions of the original on the github. <br><br>  And so, on the day of release of version 3.1, I changed the domain binding to the new version, which I was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/127415/">eager</a> to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/127415/">share with Habr.</a> <br><br>  After that, it was decided to make the project completely open, but first of all it was necessary to maximally facilitate the work on updating translations.  Since originals are stored and edited in textile, textile was also used in Rusrails.  In addition, the translations were stored in the repository, and added to the database with a ractack at a delay.  That is, now the process of translating this is that a diff is taken between the current and current versions, and these changes are translated. <br><br>  Now the project is completely open (both the code and the translation texts are open), anyone can help both in improving the texts and developing the site (currently there are 3 such contributors).  The code is located in the <a href="https://github.com/morsbox/rusrails">repository on Github.</a> <br><br>  Also on the site opened <a href="http://rusrails.ru/discussions">a discussion section</a> where you can discuss either some part of the manual, or just ask a question.  The section is more designed for beginners. <br><br>  And finally, in honor of the two-year anniversary of <a href="http://rusrails.ru/">Rusrails.ru</a> , a pdf-version of the Russian-language translations of the official Rails <a href="http://rusrails.ru/">manuals</a> was prepared.  Link to download on the home page of the site. <br><br>  <b>UPDATE for moderators</b> : no need to transfer to ‚ÄúI am promoting‚Äù - firstly, there is no PR here, the project was done on a voluntary basis, I personally did not bring any benefit and is unlikely to bring it.  Secondly, if you think that this is unformat, you can simply delete the post, I will not be offended. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142432/</a></p>
