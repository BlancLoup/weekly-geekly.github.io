  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Disrupt NY 2012: the best of the best this year</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/tag/disrupt/">Disrupt NY 2012</a> was held in New York - a start-up competition organized by TechCrunch.  For three days, on May 21-23, an unprecedented lynch of young projects took place, seeking to win the coveted prize of $ 50,000.  Let's look at those five software projects selected for participation in the final contest. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Ark </h4><br>  A search engine that helps you search and build samples on Facebook, Google +, Twitter and many other services, so you can see if your classmates live in the same city as you, are not married, and so on.  Unlike Google‚Äôs social search, more than thirty formal conditions and filters are available in <a href="http://ark.com/">Ark</a> .  If Google is already showing success in this direction, then the social network number 1 is not very good: Facebook has already tried to buy Ark, but without success.

    <h4>  Babelverse </h4><br>  The service offers a universal solution for speech translation based on the community.  Since machine recognition of speech is inadequate in quality, the founders decided, then let those who can do it - people will do the translation.  In fact, the project is a platform, on one side of which there are translators who translate speech in real time, and on the other side - poor tourists who get lost in an unknown country or journalists who are too lazy to decipher the recording of the interview.  Who knows, maybe the guys were inspired by Rajesh's dream about Siri :) <br><br>  Nevertheless, if the project really gains popularity, then an online exchange of professional translators with an open market pricing mechanism will actually arise. <br><br><h4>  Open garden </h4><br>  By voluntarily sharing the details of my personal life, no one is surprised anymore, but so far very few have been eager to distribute their link to the ‚Äúneighbor‚Äù.  Well - <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/21/open-garden-lets-you-crowdsource-your-mobile-connectivity/">Open Garden</a> offers you exactly that: phones / tablets are combined into a single-level p2p-network, within which the Internet channel of each node is shared.  Applications are available for Android, Windows and Mac, but iOS support is still in the plans. <br><br>  By the way, Greg Hazel, one of the founders, was previously the lead programmer in ŒºTorrent. <br><br><h4>  Sunglass.io </h4><br>  Cloud social browser solution for 3D modeling, built on HTML5 and WebGL. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt's like Google Docs for 3D objects.  We take traditional desktop software from the world of architects and transfer it to the cloud, ‚Äùsays the founder of the project Kaustuv DeBiswas.  In addition to cloudiness, this solution also has a cost advantage: traditional software costs from $ 5,000 to $ 50,000, the basic version of the service, as always, is free, and payment goes for additional add-ons and applications. <br><br>  Naturally, this is not a complete replacement; rather, the service is intended for small groups of designers and for people involved in modeling as a hobby.  Perhaps it will become one of the specialized applications in Google Drive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f95/587/236/f95587236c150db565037d5c67ad203c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The idea is not new and not revolutionary, moreover, there have already been both successful projects and not so much on the market.  The Russian <a href="http://roomix.ru/">roomix.ru</a> , which provided, on the one hand, a convenient tool for virtual furnishing an apartment for buyers and, on the other hand, a virtual trading platform for furniture sellers, has not yet fired.  Let's not forget the well-known Google SketchUp, which is similar in purpose and business model, but is radically different in that it was cloudy only in terms of the model repository - 3D Warehouse.  Sunglass.io rises to the next level in the process of transferring 3D modeling completely online. <br><br>  As <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/tsmar/" class="user_link">tsmar</a> suggests, <a href="https://planner5d.com/">planner5D</a> ( <a href="https://planner5d.com/demo/">demo</a> ) picked up the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplanning a house / apartment and implemented it at a higher level (just like Sunglass.io, on HTML5 and WebGL). <br><br><h4>  Uberconference </h4><br>  Most startups were born and are born in the process of automating and simplifying the needs of their authors and founders, and this project is no exception.  According to the creators, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/21/uber-conference/">Uberconference</a> is an easy-to-use cloud solution for conference calls.  Killfiches of the service is postulated as follows: to enter the conference, just click on the link;  there is no need to register and log in to the service and enter other codes and passwords.  A convenient conference management and the ability to view information from the social profiles of the interlocutors during the conversation have been implemented.  The project is monetized according to the freemium model, features such as subscription and decryption of calls are assumed to be paid.  The service is executed in two isostachs - browser and for iOS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8f/3ce/7de/c8f3ce7dec2babe8a3b8328c3003e4bf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Winner </h4><br>  The winner and the owner of $ 50,000 is <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/05/23/uberconference-wins-techcrunch-disrupt-nyc/">already determined</a> (spoiler alert!), But try to guess or choose the best;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144591/</a></p>
