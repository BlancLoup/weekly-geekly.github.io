      So that's what I'll do next: <br>  I will talk about why saying this is nonsense. <br>  And I will help you cope with a lack of motivation. <br>  Is going? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why "I have no motivation" is a stupid excuse. </h4><br>  This is a universal excuse that is suitable for EVERYTHING ON LIGHT. <br>  It appears in different forms: <br><br>  "I do not need it". <br>  "I - pass." <br>  "I can not do it now - I have no motivation." <br><br>  All this sounds as if all your life energy, all your desire to do anything were sucked out of you, and you are by and large nothing more than a walking corpse.  So I imagine someone with a "complete lack of motivation": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/65b/4da/a29/65b4daa297924bcda8051abd331c089f.png"><br><br>  But the point is not the complete lack of motivation. <br><br>  It's just not enough for you to do certain things. <br><br>  You have no motivation to jog after a long day at work.  Ok, I understand that. <br>  You have no motivation to write 500 words early in the morning.  This is also understandable. <br>  You have no motivation to continue making video editing, the work with which you can‚Äôt stop, because returning to it alone will take you forever.  I know it. <br><br>  Can't you see what's going on? <br><br>  Now this universal excuse, which you can use for anything, becomes a specific problem. <br>  This particular problem is completely solvable.  And therefore it is so scary for you to part with your favorite ‚ÄúI have no motivation‚Äù. <br>  And now instead of endlessly asking an open question: <br>  ‚ÄúHow can I motivate myself?‚Äù, All you need to ask yourself: ‚ÄúHow can I motivate myself for a 10-kilometer run?‚Äù <br><br>  When you figure out what exactly you lack motivation, you can solve the problem. <br>  And this can be done in the following way. <br>  Three steps to help you find motivation for specific tasks. <br>  You can go through these three steps to get to the origins of lack of motivation, find the problem and then solve it using tools specific to the problem. <br><br><h4>  Step 1: Understand what it is that you are shelving </h4><br>  Do you really want to mow the lawn later or do you never practice it anyway - because there are always ‚Äúsome obstacles‚Äù in your way?  Maybe you are afraid of gardening and growing fruit just because you just don‚Äôt know anything about it? <br><br>  Here is a wonderful quote: ‚ÄúIf you really want to know, ask three times: why?‚Äù <br><br>  A whole business strategy has been built around this. <br><br>  Why do you never run after work? <br>  Because you have no motivation. <br><br>  Why you do not have motivation after work? <br>  Because your work is exhausting you. <br><br>  Why is your work exhausting you? <br>  Because you are bored by fellow workers, 90% of whom you hate. <br><br>  It is interesting.  It turns out that someone thought that he was avoiding runs due to lack of motivation, but it turned out that it might be worthwhile to look for another job.  So, maybe, to get motivated, you should take a side job. <br><br><h4>  Step 2: Before you take on something, find someone who does the same </h4><br>  Think, who can perfectly motivate you to write more?  Writer!  Notice, for example, Jeff Goins. <br><br>  Want to play basketball better?  I know a guy who plays well.  His name is <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BC%25D1%2581,_%25D0%259B%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">James</a> . <br><br>  Need a kick in the ass to bury your nose in your own business?  Let my friend <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DPIJElPStJpg">Gary</a> come to your rescue: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2dd/168/70e/2dd16870e12a41c78233253f7bf049a4.jpeg"><br><br>  As a result of the action of our "competitive" entity, when we see that someone does what we want to do, then we get the same reaction every time: "If he can, then I can." <br><br>  And no matter how much they can be ahead, you will always be visited by the thought: ‚ÄúHe is no different from me.‚Äù  And you have to ignite a raging flame with this spark. <br><br><h4>  Step 3: Voraciously watch inspirational videos. </h4><br>  See, read, listen and absorb everything that comes from the personalities that inspire you - everything that you can only find.  I'm serious. <br><br>  You are already pulling the cat by the tail, so you can pull it down before starting to work. <br><br>  Because after a certain period of time spent watching videos with your ‚Äúmentors‚Äù, listening to their inspiring stories and encouraging stories, reading about their success, you will eventually be fed up with all this and raise your own ass. <br><br>  That's all. <br><br>  The key to successful motivation is to motivate yourself in a particular direction.  Just spend all the time during which you are ‚Äúbusy‚Äù with nothing more than a procrastination to motivate yourself to do what you want to do. <br><br>  This is the fastest way for me to get from ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have enough motivation to run‚Äù to a 10 km run.  I am not kidding.  Because this is exactly what I did. <br><br><h4>  Result </h4><br>  June 14, 2015 I had a very bad day.  I lost a lot of time, putting off a run, and sawed myself for not running for several days. <br>  I really wanted to run 10 km in less than an hour.  I ran 10 km for the first time in February, but I just lacked the determination to meet 60 minutes. <br><br>  I "was not motivated."  I did not run for several days, I was tired, and in my head there was a mess. <br><br>  So I watched a motivational video with Greg Plitt, a fitness trainer who recently died in a tram crash.  I immediately thought: ‚ÄúGo crazy, but this guy literally died in training, and here I am sitting and Noah.  It‚Äôs not so difficult to run 10 km in less than an hour. ‚Äù <br><br>  I watched the video again.  And again.  And again.  As a result, by eight in the evening I put on my shoes and went for a run.  I listened to the audio track from that very video while running.  I must have heard it 100 times that day, but when I finished, the clock showed 56 minutes and 28 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b49/1d8/012/b491d8012d964587acf7ac530ee568d1.png"><br><br>  Bingo! <br><br>  I did exactly the same thing yesterday and today.  I vainly watched a video of Gary Varnaychuk's speeches in order to motivate myself to work more actively, which was the reason for the start of writing this article - at 9 pm on Tuesday, despite the fact that I already wrote 3 thousand words that day.  So "I have no motivation" is no longer considered. <br><br>  So: <br><ul><li>  Understand exactly what you are avoiding. </li><li>  Find someone who has already done what you are avoiding. </li><li>  Watch as much as you can about videos that inspire you. </li></ul><br><br>  So what are you really avoiding?  And what are you going to do about it? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295176/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295176/</a></p>
