  <section class="page js-page"><h1>It's time to change: what will happen to working sites and why they are not the same</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/potok/blog/323798/">publication of an article about the realities of the HR-technology market</a> , we were showered with questions about why there were no work sites in this ecosystem.  We answer: they were, you just watched inattentively!  Well, in general, we are convinced that this is a completely separate topic, which is time to discuss. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59f/27a/b34/59f27ab341bc40d59f0c6b97392e5dce.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Work sites are changing, or rather, they are undergoing change, because the HR technology market is boiling, boiling up, companies' requirements for candidates become different, as well as the needs of candidates for self-representation.  Here are 5 signs of death, which we believe should happen soon: <br><br><h4>  Social media take on the functions of work sites </h4><br>  A simple example of this: Facebook.  At the beginning of this year, Facebook <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/15/facebook-jobs/">announced</a> that they are launching an internal service for posting vacancies.  Now on the social network, all companies that have their own page will be able to post vacancies and receive feedback here.  The system is already working in the US and Canada, but when access will be given to us is still unclear.  Internal job boards will be at all companies, and suitable vacancies of various companies will be selected for candidates.  Here is how this illustration: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dee/83e/9dd/dee83e9dd41247b89a85b3511d553e65.png"><br><br>  <b>What does it mean?</b> <br><br>  <b>1.</b> This change will affect everyone.  It is only a matter of time.  The boundary between a person‚Äôs personal profile and his professional resume is blurred. <br>  <b>2.</b> Social media will allow you to increase the coverage of your job, as well as lead you to explore in more detail the sources of candidate responses. <br>  <b>3.</b> Companies will work harder on the brand of the employer and its promotion in social networks.  Now FB is the tool you have to deal with.  Here you can talk about the company, publish content, involve employees - the job boards definitely do not have such functions. <br>  <b>4.</b> You will be able to engage a passive audience.  After all, social media has profiles for everyone: both those who are actively looking for work, and those who adore their own and hold fast to the place.  What can not be said about working sites. <br>  <b>5. The</b> service will obviously become open soon and it will be possible to post vacancies from ATS directly to your page and collect feedback here.  This is convenient, it negates any mediation in the response (no working sites: we got photos of friends, read articles, and then ‚Äî oops! And responded to the vacancy). <br>  <b>6.</b> The new service has its flaws (we believe that they will be corrected, first of all, thanks to point number 5 - synchronization with ATS).  You get feedback from candidates right in Messenger.  That is, you communicate with friends here, and at the same time you have a ‚Äúdrop-drop-drop‚Äù - candidates' resume falls.  Uncomfortable, but maybe the FB will offer something? <br><br><h4>  Job boards are trying to become a platform for HR branding </h4><br>  Work sites begin transformation.  Surviving in the form in which they are now will not be easy.  Why?  There is one reason - candidates.  It is very easy to divert them from your vacancy, because on every page of job sites there are recommendations for this particular candidate, and also at least 5 banners with advertisements.  The job board becomes the Ad board and the ‚ÄúJobs of your competitors board‚Äù: /: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c4/b55/362/1c4b55362c664df2ab2dddaf68e85d97"><br><br>  So gradually, working sites will add new tools that will allow companies to promote a brand or automate some processes (which, as we know, job board giants are already working on).  That is, it is generally a different format, a different functionality.  If there is no change, they are probably doomed to the fate of newspapers with job advertisements.  You understand what we mean? <br><br>  And recently, someone leaked information to the network, that Indeed, the vacancy aggregator (website # 1 for finding a job in the world and the same working site by and large) creates its own career site designer so that companies can create their job boards, and also tell candidates about job opportunities at the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51c/bc7/7bb/51cbc77bbffa4c13a8517883fa7c8221.png"><br><br>  Officially Indeed, it seems, so far nothing has been said about this, but the stuffing is curious.  All this means that work sites will be cluttered with all sorts of additional tools - because this is their way to survive and help companies through their values ‚Äã‚Äãand culture, and continue to promote jobs, but in its format. <br><br><h4>  Referral systems, networking turn out to be more effective (like other channels) </h4><br>  According to statistics and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-survey-reveals-85-all-jobs-filled-via-networking-lou-adler">research</a> , more than 80% of vacancies are closed thanks to networking and referral systems.  The figure, of course, is not a bit about Russia, and yet.  It is important to take into account the fact that some of the positions are not published at all, because there is no need for this - companies can find a candidate through their sources: whether they are employees or friends of employees. <br><br>  In general, statistics on referral recruitment in international practice is convincing: 2 times faster, the cost of a job is 2 times less, and the conversion is not 1.3%, but 8%!  That is, 8% of candidates who come through referral systems will receive an offer.  But if you publish somewhere, then only 1.3% will go through all the stages of selection. <br><br>  <b>What does it mean?</b> <br><br>  Companies are beginning to use other sources of candidates, very slowly but surely, involving employees in finding new candidates through social media.  We repeat that the process is straight creeping, but the movement is visible. <br><br>  We somehow conducted an experiment with a well-known company (here are the secrets), asking them to stop using working sites for a couple of weeks and use all other channels of involvement.  The response has not changed at all.  Job boards were generally not needed by the company - so it was possible to save on them, and not waste time.  So, recruiters and HRs in general would even need to monitor their performance from time to time to analyze the effectiveness of the tools they use to attract candidates. <br><br><h4>  Analytics should be accessible (not like apartments in Moscow): D </h4><br>  Working sites do not provide any analytics in the basic functionality. <br><br>  Response dynamics, passive / active recruitment, candidate information?  Not. <br><br>  And it is impossible to track the primary source of response when publishing a link to a vacancy in social media.  That is, here you are promoting your vacancy everywhere, which hangs on the work site, but you won‚Äôt find out where the candidate saw it in the end.  And now it becomes a straightforward moment for those who will be engaged in recruitment marketing: segmentation of response channels is important for companies that are developing and who have many different vacancies. <br><br>  <b>What does it mean?</b> <br><br>  Either companies (however, like recruiting agencies) will begin to buy special tools that, however, it will be difficult to present integrated with work sites, or they will look for other systems for compiling analytical reports.  The point is not Big Data and straightforwardly complex algorithms that allow to open a new recruiting galaxy, but that it is time to learn how to use numbers and data in the interests of business and make decisions based on them. <br><br><h4>  It's time to take into account the specifics of the professions </h4><br>  The search strategy for candidates is changing: there are specific resources that are intended, for example, only for technical specialists, or for some creative specialties.  A simple resume is no longer enough for so many (especially IT and digital) professions - hence the emergence of communities like GitHub and new resources for response, like My Circle, for example. <br><br>  This applies to analysts and journalists, and in general, anyone who can present the results of their work in a more voluminous format than a couple of lines in the summary. <br><br>  Resumes of the same type, which hang on almost everyone on a working site (or even on several), of course, also have their advantages - everyone seems to be equal, it is more convenient to compare skills, experience and all that.  But candidates want to stand out and attract the attention of the employer, for this many opportunities: to collect your profile on Tilda, to start a blog, sip a resume in Photoshop.  Such cases, even if not very successful, at least attract attention.  Candidates who want something that go beyond that are really expensive. <br><br>  <b>What does it mean?</b> <br><br>  In a world where everyone wants to talk about what he thinks, how he sees his lunch / dinner, what he likes and what annoys him, a new resume format appears.  Soon, probably, it will be some kind of common portfolio, which will include a lot of data from social networks, and from the resume, and even from your shopping list in the store.  We already talked about this at the very beginning - the page on the FB is somehow inseparable from your resume and professional image, brand.  Either working sites will find a new format that will be able to satisfy the need for the presentation of the most extravagant personalities and those who have something to tell, or a community of professionals will emerge by field of activity. <br><br>  And if now you thought ‚Äúwell, okay, but as for those who do not need their personal website, like an accountant or even a teacher‚Äù.  Here, too, we think we need changes.  First of all, in order to be able to talk about the skills, important achievements and all the conferences attended, for example.  These are certain communities of professionals, each of which has the right to its own story about itself. <br><br>  // Subscribe <a href="https://t.me/hrtechnology">to our Telegram channel</a> , there we regularly share our thoughts, articles, and all sorts of useful things.
