  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we chose the tariff for our team</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Megamind! <br><br>  We are seven people, and we advise the company.  Our main job is to audit the quality of service.  We spend a lot of time in Moscow, but our work allows us to be at home often.  The geography of our small team is extensive: Moscow, Murmansk, Nizhny Novgorod, and Krasnodar Territory, and one of us, the designer, has lived in Thailand for about half a year.  Yes, we love to travel.  True, travels have recently been questioned due to economic changes.  Again, because of these very changes, it is necessary to revise expenses, look for ways to reduce everything unnecessary and minimize what is needed.  In this post I would like to talk about my brief analysis of the offers of mobile operators.  In a month I spend about 2 thousand rubles, not particularly embarrassed in conversations.  Almost half of my calls are communication with colleagues.  Therefore, we decided to choose a corporate tariff for small businesses, having studied the proposals of five main telecom operators: MTS, Beeline, MegaFon, Tele2 and Yota. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdb/97f/178/bdb97f178b5e4cca9d5f6d6d214ef4b8.jpg" width="450"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you use a <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A3%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589%25D1%2591%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">simplified tax system</a> with a differentiated tax rate</i> , when income is taxed (‚Äúincome minus expense‚Äù), then you can reduce tax deductions ‚Äî to do this, include corporate communication costs in expenses as required by the Federal Tax Service.  We use the form of the simplified taxation system, where the tax is calculated on the total amount of income, and our expenses do not affect the amount of taxes, so we can not save so much - we just have to choose the optimal tariff.

      In addition to teamwork, many of us also freelance, and we use the phone, of course, not only for work.  Since it would be wrong to pay for all of the total revenues, we decided, moving to the common tariff, to divide the costs among ourselves. <br><br>  From the tools we use mail, Todoist, Slack and Asana, we sit daily in social networks, we correspond and organize meetings in Skype several times a week. <br><br>  Our needs: <br><ul><li>  Unlimited communication between employees in the country. </li><li>  Ideally, unlimited communication between employees abroad or not very expensive roaming. </li><li>  Internet traffic at least 3 GB. </li><li>  Cost - the lower the better. </li><li>  Included minutes for calls to other networks in the country. </li></ul><br><br>  I started the search with rates for business.  Last year a <a href="http://www.comnews-research.ru/node/70">study</a> on this topic was published by Comnews.  The authors used a complex methodology, took several variants of the "baskets" - for companies of 10, 34 and 74 people.  They also considered three levels of services - low, medium and high.  It seemed to me too difficult.  We have only seven people, and each has clear requirements.  However, I decided to conduct a simple analysis. <br><br>  Corporate tariffs solve the main problem: make communication between employees unlimited.  The SMS and MMS package is not critical for us, but it's still nice to have some amount of prepaid messages in case of problems with the Internet.  The ideal rate for us should include free calls to Russia or give enough prepaid minutes.  And you need not very expensive roaming abroad, perhaps in the form of an additional package of minutes or another option. <br><br>  To begin, we define the upper bar.  The tariff "MTS" "Business XL" for 3500 rubles per month pleases 15 GB of Internet, but I am not ready to pay that kind of money.  A similar tariff for Beeline is Platinum from the <a href="http://moskva.beeline.ru/b2b/products/mobile/tariffs/details/vse-dlya-biznesa-zoloto/">All for Business line</a> for 3,500 rubles, although there is 5 GB more Internet.  Fortunately, at home everyone has Wi-Fi, so this amount of traffic is useful, perhaps, only for watching high-quality TV shows on the train.  It makes no sense to change to 2,000 rubles a month, so we set the bar for 1,500 rubles.  There will be no lower bound, sorry, there is no free connection. <br><br>  MTS has a Business Start <a href="http://www.corp.mts.ru/mob_connect/tariffs/all_tariffs/">tariff</a> , where you can choose the amount of Internet traffic included.  Calls to MTS in Moscow and the region under one contract are free, to MTS throughout Russia the first 150 minutes are free.  That is, with a colleague from Murmansk it will be possible to talk for about 5 minutes a day - not enough.  Then you have to pay 1.5 rubles per minute.  Without the 150 minutes package, you will have to pay 10 kopecks under the contract and the region and 2 rubles per minute in Russia.  Choose the package "150 minutes" and the minimum amount of Internet traffic.  For 600 rubles per month we get calls and 3 GB of Internet.  There are options for the Internet Maxi, Super and VIP. <br><br>  "Smart Business S" costs 450 rubles per month.  This amount includes unlimited calls with colleagues in Moscow and the region, 500 minutes of calls to all numbers in Moscow, the region and to MTS across Russia, 1.5 GB of mobile Internet.  For an additional fee of 350 rubles, you can increase traffic to 3 GB, for 600 rubles - up to 8 GB. <br><br>  ‚ÄúSmart Business M‚Äù for 1000 rubles includes 1500 minutes of calls to all numbers in Moscow, the region and to ‚ÄúMTS‚Äù in Russia, and 5 gigabytes of Internet.  Calls to colleagues in the country after 1500 minutes will cost 5 rubles per minute (with the option ‚ÄúAll Russia‚Äù connected for 100 rubles), to other phones in the country - 12.9 rubles per minute.  It is better not to go beyond the package.  Calls to Thailand will cost 63 rubles per minute. <br><br>  "Business Unlimited L" is on the top bar - 1500 rubles per month.  Calls within the contract and the region are included in the price, and for conversations with other regions (within the framework of MTS) there are 4,000 minutes - 133 minutes a day.  Mobile Internet - 10 GB.  Features are excellent if not for the price.  Yes, I want cheaper. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/2ec/d82/eb6/2ecd82eb6d3c9726c391ee4269269b11.jpg" width="450"><br><br>  ‚ÄúBeeline‚Äù to the crisis has updated its <a href="http://moskva.beeline.ru/b2b/products/mobile/tariffs/index/cellphone/">‚ÄúEverything for business‚Äù</a> tariffs and hung up a calculator on the site.  ‚ÄúPlatinum‚Äù is the most expensive, we will not consider it, this amount is beyond our budget. <br><br>  "Bronze" costs 600 rubles per month, for seven subscribers - 4200 rubles per month.  In the country between employees calls are not limited.  Mobile Internet - 3 GB each.  You can call to Thailand from Moscow for 20 rubles per minute, from other regions - 40 rubles.  If you are in Thailand, then an outgoing call to Russia will cost 17 rubles per minute.  The tariff includes 3000 SMS and MMS. <br><br>  The second option - "Silver."  It costs 1000 rubles, but for this money the Internet is already 9 GB - in case you have to travel long distances from Wi-Fi to Wi-Fi, and in case of unstable operation of your home or office network.  Talk here 1500 minutes to other networks.  A day is 50 minutes.  For another 500 rubles (the service "Everywhere as at home") all the minutes will apply to long-distance calls when traveling around Russia and entering abroad in a number of countries - including Thailand, which we need. <br><br>  The third option - ‚ÄúGold‚Äù - offers 15 GB of Internet and 5,000 minutes of calls for 1,500 rubles a month.  Almost the same conditions as MTS Business XL, but 1000 less minutes and 2000 rubles cheaper.  The monthly fee already included included in Europe, CIS, China, USA, Egypt and Thailand. <br><br>  As I wrote above, "Platinum" did not choose.  Still, 3,500 rubles a month for each person only for communication is a bust for a small company of freelancers.  Toad strangle. <br><br>  One of the main advantages of the line is a completely unlimited communication between colleagues, including calls, SMS and MMS.  In the tariffs of MTS and MegaFon for calls to colleagues in other cities you will need to either pay extra, or they are spent from the included minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f97/eae/4a6/f97eae4a68d247f1afd6028a248fb269.jpg"><br><br>  What about MegaFon?  On the site hangs a calculator of <a href="http://moscow.megafon.ru/corporate/mobile/tariffs/alltariffs/">"Corporate Unlimited"</a> .  Chose at a price of up to 1,500 rubles - received the "Corporate Unlimited S 5000+".  Without additional options the tariff will cost 1500 rubles per month.  For this money, we will get 5,000 minutes of outgoing calls at home and to MegaFon in Russia, 15 GB of Internet and 5,000 messages.  And for calls to other countries without additional options you will have to pay: for example, 50 rubles for Asia per minute, and in the CIS and Ukraine - 12 rubles.  So in the case of our lover to paint on the beach in Thailand will have to spend money.  Calls across Russia to other operators will be slightly cheaper - 10 rubles per minute. <br><br>  Slightly cheaper will cost "Corporate Unlimited M 1500+".  It costs 1,200 rubles a month, 9 Gb of internet are included in the tariff, 1,500 minutes for calls in the home region and MegaFon Russia, 3,000 SMS and MMS in the country. <br><br>  In general, I am slightly confused with MegaFon and called customer support.  The only tariff that is suitable when working throughout Russia is L, because it includes calls to other regions.  You can choose 500, 1500 and 5000 minutes.  ‚ÄúCorporate Unlimited L 500+‚Äù is unlimited communication with MegaFon in the home region, 500 minutes of calls to other networks in the region and Russia, incoming and outgoing in Russia and incoming calls in Europe.  Plus 3 GB of Internet and 3000 SMS and MMS.  Roaming for Thailand will have to be connected separately, this is the option ‚ÄúAround the World‚Äù - 9 rubles per day plus 9 rubles per sms and per minute of conversation.  Price does not bite.  But the Internet abroad will cost 329 rubles for 10 MB per day or 829 rubles for 30 MB per day - the amount is very high. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/ea1/7b9/1bc/ea17b91bc7d217587fedd168dc1629e6.jpg" width="450"><br><br>  "Tele 2" pleased with the generally low prices.  For example, <a href="http://spb.tele2.ru/business/">the Gamma tariff</a> is 250 rubles per month.  He offers unlimited calls between employees and 500 minutes of conversations with all numbers in St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region and Tele 2 in Russia.  And another 1.5 GB of Internet.  There is a minus: we need Moscow.  And the second minus is that only at the end of last year, Tele 2 began launching an already outdated 3G, so how can I spend this 1.5 GB of traffic?  The tariff "Beta" for 400 rubles per month has 3 GB and 1000 minutes of calls, but due to the lack of high-speed Internet, these tariffs still drop out of the fight. <br><br>  Yota has <a href="http://www.yota.ru/voice">tariffs for individuals</a> who, at first glance, are suitable for us.  700 rubles will cost 600 minutes of national calls, another 300 rubles for unlimited internet.  Inside the network "Yota" calls are not limited.  50 rubles - unlimited short messages.  Total goes 1040 rubles per month.  This is not a business tariff, but a tariff for individuals that satisfies our needs.  Calls from Thailand to Russia will cost 79 rubles, to other countries - 129 rubles.  But there is a problem with the coating.  The network is only in large cities, and not all.  In Murmansk, for example, there is no coverage - neither voice communication nor the Internet. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Operator, <br>  Tariff name, add.  options </th><th>  Subscription fee (rubles. / Month.) </th><th>  House calls (included min.) </th><th>  Country calls to colleagues (min included) </th><th>  Calls on the country to other operators </th><th>  Call to Thailand (rub / min) </th><th>  Included Internet traffic (GB) </th></tr><tr><td>  "MTS" <a href="http://www.corp.mts.ru/mob_connect/tariffs/business_start/">"Business start"</a> + 150 minutes + "Internet Mini" </td><td>  <font color="green">600</font> </td><td>  150 <br>  Unlimited calls to colleagues in Moscow and Moscow Region.

Silver "with the additionally connected service" Everywhere as at home ".  There are 9 GB of Internet, 1500 minutes of calls: in the home region and travel around Russia, long-distance communication and incoming calls in Thailand.  The most important thing here is complete no limit for conversations and messages between colleagues throughout Russia.  On a business trip in Thailand, an outgoing call will cost 17 rubles.  A call from Moscow to Thailand - 20 rubles per minute.  Monthly fee - 1500 rubles. <br><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Operator, <br>  Tariff name, add.  options </th><th>  Monthly fee rub / month </th><th>  House calls (included min.) </th><th>  Country calls to colleagues (min included) </th><th>  Calls on the country to other operators </th><th>  Call to Thailand (rub. / Min.) </th><th>  Included Internet traffic (GB) </th></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://moskva.beeline.ru/b2b/products/mobile/tariffs/details/vse-dlya-biznesa-serebro/">Beeline ‚ÄúEverything for business.</a>  <a href="http://moskva.beeline.ru/b2b/products/mobile/tariffs/details/vse-dlya-biznesa-serebro/">Silver "</a> +" Everywhere at Home " <br></td><td>  1000 + 500 = 1500 </td><td>  1500 </td><td>  <font color="green">Unlimited</font> </td><td>  1500 min <br>  Further 2 rub / min </td><td>  <font color="green">20</font> </td><td>  9 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  There is something to choose from, but everything is very individual.  It is important to understand how employees are scattered around the country.  If everything is in Moscow and the region - the options are full.  Their number is narrowed when you need to call in Russia.  In the case of Beeline, calls between employees are unlimited across the country, at no additional charge, and are free to Beeline.  MegaFon is free only at home.  Plus, it is important to understand the coverage of the operator, as in the case of the ‚ÄúYota‚Äù - everything is fine, if the voice communication worked everywhere, like in the Big Three.  And then you have to look how long someone spends abroad, where the calls are expensive.  Moreover, in particular countries, the conditions of each of the operators can vary greatly.  And, in the end, you have to look at the prices and compare who has more minutes / internet for less.  If smartphones for two cards - there will be a greater choice, but I only have an iPhone, and I do not plan to change it. <br><br>  The common problem of most mobile operators: in the process of segmenting the audience, they played too much and created a lot of tariffs, options and packages.  To understand the variety of conditions, you need a huge amount of time and effort.  Having plunged headlong into this hell, I gave preference to a specific Beeline offer - the selected tariff and option will allow us to get at least 40% savings.  But once again I will say that everything is individual.  I hope that the work I have done will be useful for those who are thinking about reducing communication costs and will definitely face a painful choice.  And yet, why operators complicate the choice for the consumer, and not vice versa, for me it remains a mystery. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289252/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289252/</a></p>
