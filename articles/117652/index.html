Much of what I described here I have not found anywhere on the net.  I hope this helps to pass this stage without common mistakes. <br><br>  So, here you have an application ready and it appeared in the AppStore.  The first stream of people to it is sent from the iTunes / App Store, by itself - due to the appearance in the "updates".  There is nothing to rely on him for - he both came and will leave in a couple of days.  During this time, you need to do everything to start writing about the program or game on the network.  If the program during this time can also collect an Internet audience, then it will be much easier to go to the tops.  And to collect it, at the time of launch in the App Store you need to do a lot already.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  To further it is a little clearer than I illustrate tips, a few words about the game itself. <br><br>  This is a Word puzzle, a puzzle, but at the same time abundantly filled with humor.  You need to collect phrases like " <i>Learn to cook soup with meatballs."</i>  <i>First you need to clear the dumplings from the peel ...</i> "or" <i>If you really love, then such a woman so that she would not be ashamed to appear in the eyes of his wife</i> "," <i>Reality is</i> <i>not necessary to</i> collect the phrase in a foreign language the language is also useful - in addition to the pleasant feeling of having understood the untranslatable wordplay, you practice, remember the rules of grammar, which articles are put before what, the word order in the sentence, and so on, which is very well absorbed in the game form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c8f/b41/666/c8fb4166651c8aee7aaae838b5afc8ff.jpg"><br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  In order for the audience of the game and the reviewers to be happy, even at the development stage I noted for myself the main points: <br><ul><li>  <b>There must be a fan in the game!</b>  For mobile phones, the software should be either very useful or entertaining.  Everything between - somehow does not go.  Humor is one of the ‚Äúinexpensive‚Äù but effective ways to influence emotions.  You can still ‚Äútake‚Äù super music and beautiful animation (for example, World of Goo, Angry Birds), but these paths are more difficult, longer, more expensive and your game may not even see the light at all due to the fact that you underestimated your strength.  Therefore, in Wordrive made a bet on humor.  On a very good humor. </li><li>  <b>Compatible with the entire Apple-iOS product line</b> .  IPad, iPhone 4 and iPhone 3G have a different distribution, and for each Wordrive released its own graphics.  This is often easy and not particularly expensive when you think about it at the ‚Äúzero‚Äù stage.  This has increased the size of the game, it is a small minus. </li><li>  <b>professional design</b> .  Very many developers decide on the design issue on their own.  For games, it seems so impossible, but rare instances make their way through excellent gameplay.  I decided not to save on this issue, and found a designer who specializes in game design for iPhones. </li><li>  <b>original soundtrack</b> .  This "trick" is also inexpensive, and gives both the program and reviews additional advantages.  I can't listen to this soundtrack - I tested the game for several months every day, but people like it, yes. </li><li>  <b>multilingual</b> .  What is there to hide, the Russian market, unfortunately, is quite small in order to recoup the game, for which there is not much money and opportunity.  To add interface localization to the main European languages ‚Äã‚Äãis usually very simple and inexpensive.  In my case it was more difficult - I attracted neytiv-speakers, three or four from each country to participate in the preparation of content (phrases). </li><li>  <b>multilingual website brand, logo and "beautiful domain"</b> .  First, you need to find a name that does not make its way in Google and Yandex, more or less euphonic and short.  Wordrive is a written word from the words word (word), drive (drive) or rive (split).  This well reflected the gameplay, where phrases should be collected from broken words.  the same idea reflects the logo.  Managed to register domains <a href="http://wordrive.com/">wordrive.com</a> , <a href="http://wordrive.ru/">wordrive.ru</a> , <a href="http://wordrivegame.com/">wordrivegame.com</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  In the course of the project, we added two more ‚Äúchips‚Äù to the project, which should ‚Äúwork out‚Äù and which are easy to implement: posting from a program to twitter / facebook and having a <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/wordrivelite/id430327258%3Fmt%3D8">free version of WordriveLite</a> .  At the end of the article I will touch on the resulting disadvantages associated with these points. <br><br><h2>  LOOK &amp; FEEL </h2><br><br>  The issue with design and logo is extremely important for promotion.  Sites reviewers do not have the particular joy of inserting an unattractive picture into their site, because they do it not so much for you, but for clicks on links like ‚Äúmore‚Äù - because, among other things, they need traffic.  Then it works, how well the editors selected the product for review - if the audience liked it, then these people will return to this site again.  But this is only later.  And first you need to appear on it.  After all, until people have tried your game or program, they see only screenshots and words.  If there is a flaw, only a few will be able to evaluate the game.  And reviews will be done more often for money and more often for more. <br><br><h2>  Press kit </h2><br><br>  To promote any product you need to provide the press with high-quality material.  Good resolution logo, soundtrack, videos, press releases, application icons in different resolutions.  We have done for this a <a href="http://wordrive.com/pk/">separate section with a short name</a> .  If the target market is the whole world, then the screenshots, the video, and the press releases should be translated into the main languages.  At the same time, and letters sent to sites with reviews of applications. <br><br>  The website has been translated into six languages, while the index page determines the region from which the user enters the website and redirects it to the appropriate language version.  It is also worth making a separate link that redirects the user to the appstore, depending on the region.  It makes sense to give this link to partners instead of a direct link so that you can track conversions.  Apple Software, unfortunately, is extremely laconic in terms of statistics.  So, we have <a href="http://itunes.wordrive.com/">itunes.wordrive.com</a> .  From America redirect to American appstore, from Russia - to Russian. <br><br><h2>  REVIEWS ON EXTERNAL SITES </h2><br><br>  For video recording, a plug-in to the iPhone emulator for Xcode was used, which was previously written on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/macosxdev/114675/">Habr√©</a> .  Recorded video requires, however, post-processing - in horizontal mode, video is created upside down and without sound, but iMovie quickly solves these problems. <br><br>  The devices themselves were used to create screenshots.  You need to tinker with screenshots - six languages ‚Äã‚Äãand two devices (iPhone &amp; iPad) are 12 screenshots of one screen.  If the game has three demonstration screens, as a result, 36 screenshots come out.  I got them twice.  But it's worth it.  Same with the video.  We made a separate video for the <a href="http://wordrive.com/ru/video/">Russian audience</a> , separately for the <a href="http://wordrive.com/en/video/">British</a> , separately for the <a href="http://wordrive.com/fr/video/">French</a> , <a href="http://wordrive.com/de/video/">Germans</a> , <a href="http://wordrive.com/es/video/">Spaniards</a> and <a href="http://wordrive.com/">Italians</a> . <br><br>  I did the translation into <a href="http://wordrive.com/en/about/">English and</a> <a href="http://wordrive.com/fr/about/">French</a> myself; for the translation of press releases into German, Spanish, Italian, I used the <a href="http://onehourtranslation.com/">onehourtranslation.com</a> service.  They have done a very good translation, and they have a ‚Äútrick‚Äù - after paying the order, they draw a big watch with a stopwatch and promise to issue a transfer no later than an hour later.  I had nowhere to hurry, I threw the task and went to the store.  I come - the entire mailbox in the exciting letters from the translator.  It is not cheap - the translation of one press release cost $ 20. But neyp-speakers.  And you can continue to communicate with them after the transfer. <br><br>  There is a way to spend 4 times less, which I have not experienced, but in terms of quality it will not be much worse.  There is a service <a href="http://fiverr.com/">fiverr.com</a> , where people from all over the world offer services for five bucks.  to translate three or four paragraphs into his native language from English for a French student is 10 minutes, and he earns five dollars a day for his tea.  Quality - you know, you can not guess.  But this is better than not having a translation at all.  For budget decisions - exit. <br><br>  By the way, geotargeting showed itself very well at <a href="http://wordrive.com/">wordrive.com</a> - opening the corresponding language version of the visitor's location.  Italians show Italian, Germans - German, etc. <br><br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td> <b>An example of why translations are important.</b> <br><br>  As for the importance of communicating in my native language, I will show an example from my own practice.  In response to an appeal to one of the French sites for a review, their manager sends the following letter: <br><br> <code>Cause of lot submission for free test to application. <br> The team of ... can be make review for 35‚Ç¨. <br> The website do 13k visitors per day for 600 000 views pages per month. <br> Tell me if you want a complete review for your app.</code> <br> <br>  35 euros is really dofiga.  I notice their website, and it‚Äôs really visited, but there is some kind of dead activity among users.  Look at the comments - the more of them, the better.  Everything else is from the evil one.  Googled, decided that it was still worth working with them. <br><br>  I answer him: <br><br>  <b><i>Salut!</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>Actuellement les prix sont tr√®s √©lev√©s pour moi.</i></b>  <b><i>Mais je comprends un compromise, me permettre d'accepter cette offre avec de l√©g√®res modifications.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>Je suis pr√™t √† payer 10 ‚Ç¨ online et je suis et je suis pr√™t √† vous envoyer 5 codes promo pour faire un concours.</i></b>  <b><i>Et aujourd'hui.</i></b> <b><i><br></i></b>  <b><i>Que pensez vous de cette variante?</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>Rauf.</i></b> <b><i><br><br></i></b>  <b><i>PS Je m'excuse pour mon mauvais fran√ßais, J'ai √©tudi√© le fran√ßais les trois derniers mois :-)</i></b> <br><br>  <i>(Hello! At the moment, something is dear to me. I propose a compromise with which I am ready to accept your offer with minor changes. I am ready to pay 10 euros, and in addition to give five more promotional codes. And that's all today. How's that option?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Rauf</i> <i><br></i>  <i>PS I apologize for my French, I have only been studying it for the last three months :)</i> <br><br>  Forty minutes this text "gave up", my French is very weak.  In a minute a letter arrives: <br><br> <code>Bonjour, <br> <br> C'est ok pour 10‚Ç¨ + 5 promocodes (+1 pour le test) <br> Dans l'attente des 10‚Ç¨ (...) ainsi que les promocodes. <br> Le test sera en ligne d'ici demain maximum. <br> En vous souhaitant une bonne journ√©e !</code> <br> <br>  Review made a chic, ten euros is not a pity. <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  You also need to be attentive to small frauds at this stage.  You have released a new application and information about the release immediately spreads to specialized sites that automatically collect new items that are inhabited by very specific individuals.  Depending on the degree of arrogance, they can either subscribe by a representative of a review site and ask for a small amount of money for the review, or they can promise to write a review for the promotional code.  I received several such letters - you need to be very attentive to the e-mails from which such letters are written.  Quite often, official e-mails, even rather big sites, are hosted on Google‚Äôs Microsoft Free Mail.  Changed one letter or symbol - and this is another e-mail.  Pay money, but there will be no review.  Those who beg for promotional codes often do so in order not to buy - after all, to unsubscribe them a letter takes half a minute, and for you the promo code is still free, and probably many people get new games like that.  Money needs to be transferred very carefully. <br><br>  It seems that some sites are specially created to sell reviews on them.  There are almost none of the visitors there, and these owners do not care at all, and all the content consists of those who broke up with a little money.  There is nothing illegal in such activities, but it will not ‚Äúwork out‚Äù those invested in the review of the media.  Google, pay attention to the comments on the forum activity. <br><br>  For example, I received an offer from the site <a href="http://appdictions.com/">AppDictions.com</a> .  The site is beautiful, some reviews, asking for bucks 20-40 for the review.  In this case, all the reviews come with zero comments, and these friends are not even shy of nickname appdictions to write in the forums <a href="http://www.ipadforums.net/ipad-reviews/18301-good-review-sites.html">reviews about themselves in the third person</a> , what they are good. <br><br>  It is worth having at hand pre-prepared letters on different situations in different languages.  Better yet, find (or invent, finally) a Western representative on whose behalf you will be sending out announcements.  If this is a real person, it will be easier with the "language".  To understand why this is necessary, you can imagine yourself in the place of the Russian webmaster of a resource about iPhones, to which a letter comes from China, in which in the field from hieroglyphs, everything seems to be in English, but half you don‚Äôt understand (if only because the Chinese were taught different English), he sent screenshots with the Chinese letters in the status bar - obviously it is necessary to redo it.  In general, he loses his letter to any letter from his native Vanya with his next Russian ‚Äúgallows‚Äù. <br><br>  Send announcements to quickly and immediately in a bunch of places in a pack, in a short period of time.  For this you need to prepare in advance not only the text, but also a list.  I used one of the mailing services - iSpreadNews.  They did a great job, they worked well, as a confirmation they sent a couple of hundred screenshots where my press release was hammered into forms.  Answers were poured into the mail, we agreed with someone, but not with someone.  Therefore, from the point of view of efficiency, this method has not yet paid for itself.  But, incidentally, a little more time passed. <br><br>  But just making a newsletter via macpr or iSpreadNews is not enough.  Almost every such site has a forum.  The sense of each individual forum is small, but the presence "at every corner" begins to work.  99% of Western forums work on engines with the same markup language (tags in square brackets).  Having well issued a post for one forum, it is almost always transferred to the others without any changes.  Such a workpiece is also worth doing, using as much as possible the possibility of a markup language. <br><br>  iSpreadNews in their ad writes that their trick is that besides the stupid work of driving in forms in a short time, they sell the knowledge ‚Äúwhere to drive‚Äù.  Screenshots from them come without an address bar, but there is a service that answers the question ‚Äúis there a site in their database‚Äù.  They are likely to receive links to new sites from this service, which were not in the database and immediately add them. <br><br>  How to find a list of regional sites with reviews? <br><br>  Each regional app includes in the top at least one or two programs developed strictly to the local market.  If we assume that since they are in the top, then with the promotion they are doing quite well (well, the software is interesting, of course).  Enter in Google the name of the application, limit the search by domain or language.  We get a list of sites where the game is mentioned.  There through one go sites with ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù domains, quite suitable for our needs.  We make a list, then we go through it. <br><br>  For example, take the German app.  On the website <a href="http://applyzer.com/">applyzer.com</a> we look at the ratings in Germany and we find in them obviously German software with a German-specific name.  Among other things, ‚ÄúJ.  Lafer - Meine besten Rezepte. "  We are convinced that the language of the application is German.  So the authors should promote mainly in the German segment of the network.  We try to search <a href="http://www.google.ru/search%3Fas_q%3D%26as_epq%3DJ%2BLafer%2BMeine%2Bbesten%2BRezepte%26as_oq%3D%26as_eq%3D%26hl%3Dru%26newwindow%3D1%26lr%3Dlang_de%26cr%3D%26as_ft%3Di%26as_filetype%3D%26as_qdr%3Dall%26as_occt%3Dany%26as_dt%3Di%26as_sitesearch%3D%26as_rights%3D%26safe%3Dimages%26btnG%3D%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%2B%25D0%25B2%2BGoogle">Google pages in German</a> .  As a result, we obtain the following set of sites: <br><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <a href="http://www.macwelt.de/">www.macwelt.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://macnotes.de/">macnotes.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://iszene.com/">iszene.com</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://appleunity.de/">appleunity.de</a> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://macpodcast.de/">macpodcast.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://appletrend.de/">appletrend.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://aboutmacs.de/">aboutmacs.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://apptests.de/">apptests.de</a> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://ipodmod.de/">ipodmod.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://apfelpower.de/">apfelpower.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://computerwissen.de/">computerwissen.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://admartinator.de/">admartinator.de</a> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://youmac.de/">youmac.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://apfelcenter.de/">apfelcenter.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://macinplay.de/">macinplay.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://textlab.de/">textlab.de</a> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://macnewsblog.de/">macnewsblog.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://application-store.net/">application-store.net</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://appsblog.de/">appsblog.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://iphone-notes.de/">iphone-notes.de</a> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://podcast.de/">podcast.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://macuser.de/">macuser.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://ipod-forum.de/">ipod-forum.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://iphoneblog.de/">iphoneblog.de</a> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://apfelmag.com/">apfelmag.com</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://apfeltalk.de/">apfeltalk.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://appfuchs.de/">appfuchs.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://macbug.de/">macbug.de</a> </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="http://loadblog.de/">loadblog.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://mobiload.de/">mobiload.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://chip.de/">chip.de</a> </td><td>  <a href="http://pcgames.de/">pcgames.de</a> </td></tr></tbody></table><br><br>  Another way to find regional sites on the topic is to feed Google a list that you already have and watch what comes out in response.  It does not always work, but if you now search for the domains that I have indicated above, then Google will point to this page.  Perhaps somewhere there are the same lists for other countries, on some forum. <br><br><h2>  BANNERS </h2><br><br>  Absolutely consciously invested money in AdMob, despite the fact that the entire Internet writes that the network does not work as it should for iPhone applications.  There were 250 conversions for <a href="http://itunes.wordrive.com/">$ 20</a> , good - zero.  There are 30 more left, I will be glad to any advice where to attach them (you cannot withdraw money from there). <br><br><h2>  SOCIAL NETWORKS </h2><br><br>  As for promotion in social networks, we also, as with banners, have more negative experiences.  Of course, it works.  Both twitter and facebook give their results.  But in terms of the ‚Äúwasted power / sales‚Äù ratio, this tool loses much to reviews ‚Äî even on some low-attendance forums.  In order for a social network to produce a result, it is necessary, as in nuclear power, to reach a critical mass.  While it will not, sense - zero.  The share of iPhones among friends on <a href="http://facebook.com/raufaliev">my Facebook</a> , most likely from the specifics of the industry, is twice as high as the market average, and the average is 1.5-2%.  Therefore, in order to promote in social networks, apparently, you need to attract professional services advertisers, and this is akin to spam.  Again, looking at the percentage is unlikely to pay off. <br><br>  Nevertheless, it is necessary to add posting services to social networks, connect the Game Center, create Facebook pages.  When it works, it‚Äôs pretty hard to predict.  But this is at least some feedback.  Here, for example, <a href="http://twitter.com/">someone quite often posts</a> English phrases to your twitter from our application. <br><br>  Facebook is especially bad because it is extremely opaque.  I do not know who wrote about my game on Facebook, I only see some transitions from there, it is not even clear from whom there are a few of those transitions.  Twitter is much more transparent. <br><br>  By the way, you should definitely check out such a thing - when your website is quoted on Facebook, it loads the picture itself and tries to pull out the first lines of the text.  So, on a large part of quite well-made websites, Facebook is mistaken with a picture and text and it comes out biliberda.  I am on my website for Facebook specifically giving another page, where the application icon and a special ‚Äúfacebook‚Äù text are substituted for it. <br><br>  It is <a href="http://wordrive-game.livejournal.com/">easy</a> to create an account in LiveJournal, he can even participate with might and main in ‚Äúpublic life‚Äù, but in order for him to work at least somehow, he needs attention, a lot of attention.  In order to somehow run an interest in social networks, I made the service ‚Äú <a href="http://my.wordrive.com/">create your own phrase</a> ‚Äù and sent it to a friend.  This is my next experiment and I will tell if the audience will be interested in how it will end.  Again, recalling the critical mass, I have no great hopes.  Although it turned out cool. <br><br><h2>  STATISTICS </h2><br><br>  This is very bad.  At first, I was surprised at how much the quality of Apple interfaces and services targeted at the general public and developers was different.  Statistics, and the back office of iTunes Connect, require a separate article for review.  For example, yesterday it took two hours for me to fill in in advance prepared screenshots for four language versions of the program - all these two hours I knew what to do and was on a very fast dedicated channel.  As an example of oddities from the ‚Äúnative‚Äù statistics: in the Safari browser, on MacOS X, the statistics section is executed on a flash, loaded once, and gives numbers in a very indecent way, very simplified.  For example, as I said, we have two products in the AppStore - a <a href="http://itunes.wordrive.com/">full</a> - <a href="http://itunes.wordrive.com/">featured Wordrive</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/wordrivelite/id430327258%3Fmt%3D8">its free version</a> .  So, when displaying statistics separately for paid and free numbers, there are, but for countries only aggregate, aggregate statistics are used.  Understand how much bought, for example, in the US - from standard statistics is impossible.  There is also a lack of realtime statistics, which Apple does not provide in principle, there is not enough information on referer to track sales.  It is impossible to find an application for iPhone / iPad iTunes Connect Mobile through a search in the AppStore, which is also frustrating - you need to follow the link from itunes Connect Web.  <a href="http://www.ideaswarm.com/products/appviz/">AppViz for Mac is</a> highly recommended as a good replacement for statistics, but this thing is paid and quite expensive.  I did not find free services of normal statistics, as well as free applications.  I also use paid, but online <a href="http://appfigures.com/">AppFigures</a> , it pulls out much more distinct statistics from the same iTunes Connect, superimposes it on contour maps ... <br><br>  <b>UPDATE:</b> In a nearby blog, I published <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/macosxdev/118032/">an article about statistics</a> .  It explains what statistics mean by ‚Äúyesterday.‚Äù  As it turned out, there is not so obvious. <br><br><h2>  FINDINGS </h2><br><br>  Probably, I will not reveal any americans with them - reviews work best.  I hope that with some examples from practice I have warned someone against mistakes, and some finds may be useful in creating my own projects for the readers of this material.  Probably the most valuable material on our project will appear when the project becomes successful and at least pays for the time and money invested in it.  So far this is not so, but only the beginning.  Despite the fact that at the start of the project, I deliberately did not set commercial goals for him, his success is extremely valuable to us.  If the audience of Habra will support this material, I will be happy to share the details of the promotion of this product and further. <br><br>  Continued: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/apple/118781/"><b>Press releases: sharing experience on the example of Wordrive and prMac</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117652/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117652/</a></p>
