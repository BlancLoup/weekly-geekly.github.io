  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Opportunities for students you may not have known about</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There are many reasons to dislike the current educational system - they teach poorly, technology is outdated, a lot of unnecessary information, etc.  I also thought so, and in one degree or another I think.  But despite this, students have many opportunities that they don‚Äôt even realize.  In this article, I decided to collect tips that should be useful to students during their studies.  Unfortunately, I learned a lot in my last year, or even after graduating from university. <br><br>  So let's go ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  ISIC </h4><br>  ISIC is an international student ID card that is valid worldwide.  With it, you can get big discounts (up to 50%) on air and train tickets, discounts on visiting libraries, museums of cinemas, shops, bars, restaurants, etc.  Discounts can vary from 5% to 50%.  Registration of such a ticket costs a penny, and you can get a big profit.  As a rule, it is necessary when visiting foreign countries (in Ukraine, ISIC is really valid only in large cities). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      It must be said that under international standards masters and graduate students are also equated with students. <br><br><h4>  Software </h4><br>  Software developers are very fond of students - as a rule, in addition to commercial licenses, vendors provide educational licenses for training completely free of charge (as a rule) or at a significant discount (less often). <br><br>  For example, Microsoft provides a large number of software within the DreamSpark program - registration with ISIC or with a student ID. <br><br><h4>  Olympics </h4><br>  Strangely enough, but every year a large number of competitions are held in different directions - and these competitions can take place both on the basis of universities, and on the basis of independent organizers.  I recommend to take part in those and others.  The papers and diplomas that you receive may not be useful to you, but the experience gained will be useful more than once. <br><br>  You should also pay attention to international competitions - for example, <a href="http://msug.vn.ua/Posts/Search%3Fquery%3DMicrosoft%2520Imagine%2520Cup">Microsoft Imagine Cup</a> - the opportunity to visit foreign countries, to get real experience in the development and performances. <br><br><h4>  Student exchange programs and summer schools </h4><br>  I always thought it was some kind of garbage.  But he was wrong.  Now you can easily send a couple of resumes and get an invitation to some university for a year.  There you can learn a language and compare education systems. <br><br>  A separate item is summer schools - the opportunity to visit foreign universities in the summer (2-3 months) as part of some specialty. <br><br>  In Russia and Ukraine, summer schools spend some universities, as well as Microsoft Research and Yandex.  The procedure is simple - send a resume (often asked for more scientific work and a review of the head) and wait for the results of the selection. <br><br><h4>  Working holidays </h4><br>  Many universities practice ala work and travel - work trips to work on holidays, earn money and at the same time pull up a foreign language.  As a rule, such trips are completely safe, it is better all the same before the final decision to check the entire "pedigree" of the employer. <br><br><h4>  Awards </h4><br>  If you are active enough, you can get special awards.  For example, Microsoft has the Microsoft Student Partners program to encourage active students, Opera has the Campus Crew program.  I am sure that if you google, then you can find a lot of similar programs. <br><br>  To do this, you must be a member of the community - to organize events, blog, etc. <br><br><h4>  Grants </h4><br>  If you try very hard, you can get a cash grant or the possibility of further study abroad.  In this place you can talk for a long time, if it is interesting - I will describe separately.  To do this, of course, you need to have a number of ideas, learn how to write business plans and conduct presentations. <br><br><h4>  Conferences </h4><br>  Students have a lot of free time.  If you are a student and think otherwise, then you are a bad student.  So, you have plenty of time, why not spend it on self-study?  And one of the ways is to walk through various events, get to know the speakers and specialists (they may even help determine the direction of work). <br><br>  And, of course, you can take an internship - and this is a completely different level.  You will be able to gain real experience and at the time of graduation you will have to wait.  In a good sense of the word. <br><br>  Disclaimer  I had a lot of experience on each of these points - somewhere good, somewhere deplorable.  The main problem is the lack of knowledge of their rights and opportunities. <br><br>  PS I cited Microsoft as examples, as I came across them more.  I would be glad if in the comments you write opportunities from other companies and organizations. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  <b>Update.</b>  At the request of workers add some links known to me: <ul><li>  <a href="http://unistudy.org.ua/">http://unistudy.org.ua/</a> - international programs and training abroad (in Ukrainian) </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A4%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0">Fulbright Program</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.opera.com/company/education/campuscrew/">Opera Campus Crew</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/rus/citizenship/news/2011_02_15.aspx">Microsoft Research Summer School</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://imaginecup.com/">Microsoft Imagine Cup competition</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_and_Travel_USA">Work and Travel</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118630/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118630/</a></p>
