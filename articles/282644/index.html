For example, coercion to buy unnecessary goods or go to the advertising link. <br><br>  The Dark Patterns collection is not a design error at all, quite the opposite.  This is the result of the work of competent professionals who consciously apply their skills for unscrupulous purposes.  They may call this an ‚Äúeffective design‚Äù or ‚Äúselling site,‚Äù but the point is in manipulating for the sake of profit. <br><br>  Unfortunately, recently some sites have returned to these dirty tricks.  This is <a href="https://rationalconspiracy.com/2016/04/24/dark-patterns-by-the-boston-globe/">illustrated</a> by the <a href="https://rationalconspiracy.com/2016/04/24/dark-patterns-by-the-boston-globe/">example of the online newspaper Boston Globe</a> , which, due to the crisis in the media market, resorted to tricks to increase the number of paid subscribers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Suppose you open the ‚Äú <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2016/04/22/open-letter-bernie-sanders/AfEtRwYJmTJ5lTNIuw4q8O/story.html">Open Letter to Bernie Sanders</a> ‚Äù article.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/964/e15/eb3/964e15eb3a6e4072970260dd57f4da1b.png"><br><br>  A pop-up window appears asking you to subscribe.  A small trick is used here: the ‚ÄúClose‚Äù button is drawn with a very slightly contrasting background, so it is difficult to notice.  In addition, it is moved to a non-standard left upper corner.  The developers expect that some users will not notice the button and subscribe. <br><br>  If you still click "Close", the manipulation continues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e89/f1e/8e7/e89f1e8e7ce14af9aacc2a64f8f2ad71.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a1/2e6/58b/4a12e658bb9c4ec8903d582976f477b2.png"><br><br>  At the bottom of the page a well-visible non-removable banner pops up, again with a proposal to issue a paid subscription.  Again, this banner itself is annoying, but quite acceptable.  However, the text says that a subscription costs "only 99 cents a week," but this is not true, as we will see below. <br><br>  Follow the link <i>Subscribe Now</i> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ea/d4f/905/7ead4f905b8f4ab5a6ec478a6b1371a0.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/66b/09b/987/66b09b98748146669c5e430521077968.jpg"><br><br>  Here it becomes clear that 99 cents a week is not a real price.  Commercial companies often offer a discount when connecting to a service or at the beginning of a subscription, this is normal.  The problem is that the Boston Globe does not indicate the real price at all, which it will begin to take in four weeks.  This is misleading the user. <br><br>  If you click <i>Sign Up</i> , we will see even more dark patterns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/700/944/341/7009443416534741820ea177c3d736b1.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/00d/942/60d/00d94260d6fc4246b7afaff24cfea10d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/983/55e/cf9/98355ecf9e584ea2a1afb36737922914.png"><br><br>  The page shows the amount that will be removed for the first month ($ 3.96).  The real price is listed below in small print.  It is selected in such a way ($ 3.99 per week) in order not to differ much from the stated red price, so that the user doesn‚Äôt immediately think that the price increases significantly: the countdown goes not by months but by weeks.  In addition, to the left of the user, by default, they subscribe to three marketing campaigns. <br><br>  At the next subscription stages, the real value is no longer shown once.  To learn it, you need to go to the FAQ section of the small link on the right side of the page. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bed/c19/c85/bedc19c853dc4055b53ac506f4905612.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23e/237/c3a/23e237c3ad4f47fbb27e4aa596a48d95.png"><br><br>  Among the questions about crosswords, obituaries and horoscopes, the question ‚ÄúHow much does a subscription to the digital version cost‚Äù is hidden. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2e/90d/f1d/a2e90df1d61742acaf635e254fae7b40.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cd1/a93/de4/cd1a93de479c45dbb285dc2cfe0a3511.png"><br><br>  It states that the real price is not at all $ 0.99 per week, as it was in an advertisement, and not even $ 3.99 per week, as reported on the subscription page, but ... $ 6.93 per week!  Almost twice as expensive or seven times more than on an advertising banner.  This price takes effect only after a year, so it will be difficult for an ordinary subscriber to notice that more money has been withdrawn from the account, if only he does not study bank statements in detail.  Very competent reception! <br><br>  And finally, the last move.  If the user still noticed something was wrong and tried to unsubscribe, then a small surprise awaits him. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2eb/3c3/7b8/2eb3c37b8e894eaca29d7a9353e93f62.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e36/3ea/6ec/e363ea6ecd044516bfe1505eff33a582.png"><br><br>  You can contact the editorial office via email or online chat, but you can only unsubscribe by phone (probably after a long wait on the paid line), while money will continue to be debited from the account until the end of the current ‚Äúfour-week period‚Äù. <br><br>  Unfortunately, these and other dark patterns are often found on quite respectable and decent sites, including Russian ones.  So you can increase sales in the short term, but in the long term, they damage the reputation of the brand. <br><br>  On the Dark Patterns website, all types of manipulative web design techniques are categorized. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Dark Pattern Library</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ol><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/bait-and-switch/">Bait and switch</a> .  The user performs one action, and something else happens instead. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/disguised-ads/">Disguised advertising</a> .  Banners are disguised as content or navigation to encourage the user to click on ads. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/faraway-bill/">Hidden detail</a> .  Instead of delivering detailed detailing to the user's inbox each month, service companies try to get the user to check it himself.  The implication is that he will forget to do this. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/forced-continuity/">Forced renewal</a> .  The user subscribes to a free trial service, but he is forced to extend the paid subscription. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/forced-disclosure/">Forced disclosure</a> .  In order to provide the user with a free or low-cost service, he is forced to disclose some personal information that is not really necessary to complete the transaction. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/friend-spam/">Friend Spam</a> .  The application asks for authorization, and then publishes messages on the social network on behalf of the user, sending spam to his friends. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/hidden-costs/">Hidden cost</a> .  At the last stage of payment for the product, the user is suddenly offered to pay a small amount (commission, insurance, tax, etc.). <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/misdirection/">Change of focus</a> .  The user's attention is specifically attracted to a foreign object in order to divert attention from the main one. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/price-comparison-prevention/">Prevent price comparisons</a> .  The practice of obfuscating price information in different ways: changing the quantity of goods in a package, changing the size of a package, etc. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/privacy-zuckering/">"Tsukering privacy</a> . <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/privacy-zuckering/">"</a>  The practice of using web design techniques and idioms to induce users to the right choice.  The term ‚Äútsukering‚Äù (zuckering) for such actions suggested using the Electronic Frontier Foundation. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/roach-motel/">Pitfalls</a> imply the creation of a situation where it will be as difficult for the user as possible to reject the choice made, to cancel his action (for example, to cancel a paid subscription to the magazine). <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/road-block/">Lock</a>  The interface makes it difficult for the user to perform the desired action by placing a foreign object in front of him on the screen.  For example, the appearance of advertising on the pause button in the video player. <br><br></li><li>  <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/sneak-into-basket/">Surprise in the basket</a> .  Adding excess goods to the shopping cart. <br><br></li><li> <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/trick-questions/">Questions with a trick</a> .  Appeal to the user to make a choice, when, after a cursory reading of the text, one impression is made, and if attentively, it is another.  This trick is based on the fact that users tend to inattentively read texts on the Internet (‚Äúscan‚Äù them diagonally). </li></ol></div></div><br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282644/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282644/</a></p>
