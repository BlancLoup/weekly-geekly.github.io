  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How was done "NeVerVHudo"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Instead of the preface ... <br><br>  How to translate the game?  Word by word? <br>  Try to preserve the letter and the thought of the person who invented it and what he put into it? <br>  Probably everyone asked himself this question.  After all, a well-translated story, but a game is first of all a story or a story about something, to some extent deserves a separate perception, sometimes completely different from the original.  Examples can cite a bunch. <br>  Well, at least "Buratino".  The basis is clearly taken foreign version of the story.  But the trouble is: our man cannot understand some realities of the life of a foreign boy.  And ours is another matter ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To begin with, I will immediately say that I am writing this opus only on my own behalf, and everything that has been said here is exclusively my opinion;  my comrades, with whom I happened to work, let them speak for themselves if they wish. <br>  I will not deny that after all this time I do not remember much, but I will tell you what I remember.  Do not feed me with bread sometimes - let me dilute demagogy on a specific topic.  I apologize in advance for those who are annoying. <br><br>  <b>Introduction</b> <br>  How do we look at a localized product that has been published / developed / coined for specific people, based on specific motives?  We always try on it to our worldview, ts  "to myself".  So is the game: someone wants to breathe the air of the original, to understand what the person who created this creation wanted to convey.  With pictures, for example, easier.  There is no need to know a special language.  There are eyes, mind is - stand / sit (hmm ... lie down), "perceive."  With a book a little harder.  It is necessary to know and understand the letters and symbols with which this book is written.  If you understand, then human fantasy will do its wonderful work of recreating the image.  Cinema - harder and easier at the same time.  The image has already been created, voiced and presented to us on a platter. <br>  You just have to see whether you like it or not. <br>  The game, in my opinion, the interweaving of so much and diverse ... <br>  The plot, dynamics, gameplay, world, characters, communication, sound, atmosphere ... just do not list.  Every aspect of the game includes a piece of the culture in which it was created.  And if you don‚Äôt understand what the author thought about when he created, you play only half of the game, or even some kind of parody of it.  And if we proceed from the fact that you want to make a parody of something and leave the gameplay in place, but in the parody everyone will understand everything ...

      <b>Idea?!</b> <br>  About our game, with which I will start, quite a lot has been written.  You can search, read ... <br>  Well, at least here: <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverhood">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverhood</a> <br>  Having seen it for the first time, we did not even hope (it seems to me) to convey what the author wanted to say, who had invented this world, by the way, since 1988 ... <br>  This is simply impossible in the 4 days that were given to us on the short word ‚Äútranslation‚Äù. <br>  It was done simply, in our opinion: beer was bought and brainstorming started.  I must say that a little earlier we had the idea to record our conversations on a tape recorder. <br>  And then, a few hours later, listen and discuss again.  I understand how people came up with such wonderful things as Waterfall and SCRUM.  Do not be surprised if they first had something similar (forgive me for such a comparison). <br>  We then drank the native local beer - ‚ÄúRogan‚Äù (emphasis on 'a', make no mistake).  But he was not in the store. <br>  The Tuborg was brought in wonderful, un-remembered-of-color bottles. <br>  They began to look again, but then the ‚Äúmiracle system‚Äù of Windows 95 interfered with us ... <br>  Delayed multitasking causes convulsions in a normal IT-developed person.  As in a joke, if to paraphrase it: "Now it will be copied, and we will look".  And since the CD-ROM (hehe) in those days was not very nimble, it was necessary to wait a long time.  When we launched it, we saw that the game was made in collaboration with Microsoft.  And our generator of ideas, Yuri, gave out to the mountain that it is impossible to leave it so easy ... :) <br><br>  <b>Some facts</b> <br>  A scriptwriter was invited - a wonderful girl Irina (hello to journalists!), Who together with us created the story that appeared in the game.  For quality work it was necessary to have the entire current story line and there should be a day in stock.  Those.  to transfer one day less.  :( <br>  And there is a lot of it, the text and sound are not yet picked out, the video in the outlandish SMK format looks all at once, which makes it difficult to translate. <br>  Translations of commercials, in the overwhelming majority of games, were performed ‚Äúby ear‚Äù, like listening to school.  :) <br>  An act sheet was created, where it was written what kind of character, what lives, what he says, how he says, with what expressions, what he is doing at that time.  The actor does not know how to say this or that phrase, right? <br>  I was then helped to read the script of the famous film "The Abyss" found on the web somewhere. <br>  From there, I learned what practically everything should be indicated, even what you sometimes think about ... :) And for all this one day, because in the evening they will come for the translation, and tomorrow there will be a dubbing.  And night + day + night to translate the rest. <br>  There were moments, especially after editing the text for the 8th hour in a row, with coffee breaks, when no motivation helped anymore, I just wanted to sleep and score everything ... <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúWant to try to sound?‚Äù</b> <br>  Take a break.  Already after the game was handed over, when working on another game, I was with a comrade, who performed the functions of sound processing and drawing pictures (circuit engineer, by the way, if I remember the name of the specialty correctly).  Then the actor was leaving him then, and then he said: ‚ÄúDo you want to try to voice?‚Äù - ‚ÄúI want it!‚Äù It‚Äôs interesting to leave your mark, ts  :) <br>  I was surprised to learn that I should speak with my mouth and not with my nose.  You can try ... Ideally, only the letters "M" and "H" are spoken using the nose. <br>  Those.  air and sound must go out through the mouth.  It seems that there is even an exercise when they pinch the nose and ask to speak the alphabet. <br>  If you do not do this, it turns out completely nasal and ugly, the actor then turned out much better. <br><br>  <b>Final assembly</b> <br>  On the assembly day, pictures were brought, the sound cut into correct pieces, and the texts after the night vigil, i.e.  game and a piece of the wall :) <br>  Our draftsman / sound engineer complained very much about life, he also got the full program ... Not only is there about 200+ frames in the screensaver, where the inscription ‚ÄúNot BelieveWood‚Äù is drawn, so is the wall on which the chronicle is written, all in different English characters, those.  also need to redraw. <br>  Said to somehow brighten up, he painted a "joke", but also brought normal ones, just in case. <br>  Then I repented that I had not translated the whole wall ... After several hours of manipulations with the software written for the disassembly, the game was assembled as a draft.  Began to watch. <br>  The result was 2/3 (I don‚Äôt remember exactly): two people liked what was happening, three said that it was complete nonsense and crap, but in some places it was fun ... That's it.  But there was no way back.  And rightly so. <br>  Now I already understand that probably in such a short period of time we would not have been able to do better. <br>  No ... <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, I hope you were interested ... <br><br>  PS: And maybe the continuation should ... <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/61255/"><b>Taki should</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60682/</a></p>
