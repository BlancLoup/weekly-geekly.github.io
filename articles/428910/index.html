After the successful release of the first phone, the <a href="https://habr.com/post/379471/">Original Light Phone</a> , which was supported by more than 10,000 people, the team is at the prototyping stage of its second Light Phone II model.  Since the launch of the <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/light-phone-2">campaign</a> on April 22, 2018, by November 2018, 615% of the requested amount - $ 2,036,234 - was collected on the Indiegogo crowdfunding platform.  The release is scheduled for April 2019, pre-order the phone can be purchased for $ 300, with a stated market value of $ 400. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wr/am/4i/wram4iflladc3iotgf7wggustxs.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to people who support <a href="https://habr.com/post/428720/">‚Äúdumb phones‚Äù</a> - ‚Äústupid phones‚Äù, in terms of design and usability, the Light Phone as a second phone is a worthy addition to the Iphone and other smartphones.  Despite the fact that the very need for a second phone is a controversial issue, the Light team itself, as a phenomenon of developers, whose philosophy is supported by consistent decisions at the moment of creating their products, in my opinion, deserves attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tw/kw/8t/twkw8trjnkh3j5ydoymiyp_gde4.jpeg"><br><h3>  Light Products </h3><br><h4>  Original Light Phone </h4><br>  Your second phone, which prompts you to leave your smartphone and devote yourself to doing things that you really like, without being distracted by anything else.  The creators call this experience of freeing time from the use of technology for other purposes - ‚Äúgo to the light‚Äù (‚Äúgoing light‚Äù).

      The functionality of the Original Light Phone is limited to the possibility of a telephone call and nine sets of numbers. <br><br><h4>  Light Phone II </h4><br>  A simple, 4G / LTE phone with a black and white matte display and electronic ink technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fa/rb/63/farb63ufhttcnwzzygn_ybxeyj0.jpeg"><br><br>  At the moment of prototyping, its functionality is expanded and allows you to exchange messages, set an alarm, but the device still remains a phone that respects your time.  Developers lead an open discussion with users about adding other tools that do not contradict the original concept. <br><cut></cut><br>  <b>Original Light Phone vs Light Phone II</b> <br><br>  A noticeable change in the phone in its second version was a matte black and white screen that allows you to clearly see the contents on the street in daylight.  This solution is energy efficient, and shades of gray are a healthy limitation to vision. <br><br>  A larger microphone and speaker, a USB-C, a zoom sensor, and simple up / down buttons were also added.  The team is exploring the possibility of using an aluminum case for higher strength characteristics.  Water resistance is in the plan, but does not promise to be implemented in this phone model. <br><br>  <b>The choice of operating system Light Phone II</b> <br><br>  In recent years, OS smartphones, whether Apple or Android, have become increasingly confusing, whose multi-level development requires more and more financial and human resources, which increases the final cost of the product on the market.  And as a result, instead of a simple screen device with the necessary tools, the user sees a lot of applications that are fighting for his time and attention. <br><br>  Light OS implemented several well-thought-out tools with single buttons for scrolling the ‚Äútoolkit‚Äù.  A typography-based interface is much easier and more enjoyable to use. <br><br>  <b>Light Phone II Tools</b> <br><br>  First, these are tools that do not distract you from the main business that you intend to do.  With 4G and an electronic ink screen, there is great potential to explore areas of user interaction with various tools.  Developers have open feedback that will help them navigate meaningful tools for future products. <br><br>  <b>Open conversation of developers and users about other additions to Light Phone II</b> <br><br>  According to the team, the exact assembly of the phone and the tools can be changed, since in the coming months the phone will be at the stages of tests and design. <br><br><ul><li>  Alarm clock: so you do not sleep with your smartphone </li><li>  Joint trips: want to make your way home, please </li><li>  Prelist: to abstract from the outside world and plunge into work </li><li>  Map: Go to the light and get lost, but still save the opportunity to return home </li></ul><br>  Now Light Phone II supports phone calls, speed dialing and sending messages.  Some functions, like an alarm clock, are simple to implement; others, like the ability to secure a trip home, require partnership. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/a8/9d/iy/a89diyap2bkmfxhnvdxijpw7bpo.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Specifications of Light Phone II</b> <br><br>  Dimensions: 91mm x 55mm x 6.5-7.5mm <br>  OS: LightOS (based on Android) <br>  Network: 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, GPS <br>  Memory: 1 GB DDR3 / 8 GB RAM <br>  Battery: 500 mAh <br>  Color: black / white <br>  Material: anodized aluminum <br>  Weight: 80 g (approximately) <br>  Processor: Qualcomm Snapdragon Wear 2100 platform <br>  Display: Electronic ink <br>  Battery: 5 days;  several hours talk time <br>  SIM card: Nano SIM <br>  Connector: USB-C <br>  English language <br>  Other: vibration, loud speaker, headset jack <br><br>  Cost: $ 300 by pre-sale at the stated final price of $ 400 <br>  <i>* Shipping and customs are not included.</i> <br><br>  <b>Delivery schedule</b> <br><br>  Deliveries of the finished product will begin by April 2019 (one year after the creation of the campaign).  Due to three different models for different regions around the world, different models (A, B or C) can be delivered a little earlier or later than April 2019. <br><br>  <b>Coverage areas</b> <br><br>  Currently, three Light Phone II models are planned, which will be optimized for different regions of the world. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.thelightphone.com/4gcoverage"><u>Coverage map</u></a> <br><br>  <b>SIM card</b> <br><br>  There is no SIM card provided for Light Phone II, you will need to purchase it yourself. <br><br>  Light Phone II is a standalone phone.  It works independently of your smartphone with a separate SIM card and cannot automatically use the main phone number.  When using Light Phone as a ‚Äúsecond phone‚Äù, developers will share about various ways of integrating into your lifestyle, for example, about the possibility to redirect calls, leave messages on the smartphone‚Äôs answering machine or, if your operator supports a duplicate SIM card, you can simply use the same number . <br><br>  <b>Due to the telecommunications landscape at the moment, you may not be able to fully maintain your main number for both phones.</b>  <b>Unfortunately, some of these things are beyond our control as users, but the Light team promises to continue to find solutions for more comfortable use of technology.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1p/hj/ik/1phjik4_28k0-r1g_8oshhtuahy.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428910/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428910/</a></p>
