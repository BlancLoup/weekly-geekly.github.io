It‚Äôs a pity, it‚Äôs possible to do it only once per conference ... In any case, today we have something to talk about: we have opened access to video recordings of the best reports of the DotNext 2016 Moscow conference and are nearing the end of the DotNext 2017 Piter program (Peter, May 19-20) about which I will also say a few words. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/p/324038/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c37/3a1/646/c373a1646e5d4c9391871fb0ecd4f048.png"></a>

But there are examples that clearly indicate that a good algorithm and elegant code are almost never enough to withstand high loads.  In the second half of the report, Marco demonstrates several optimizations that worked for Stack Overflow. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bd5WYql5vlg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  In ninth place we have a report by Vagif Abilov ‚ÄúMy life with actors: the experience of introducing the model of actors on F #‚Äù, dedicated to the process itself and the pitfalls of transition of a media project with a large amount of video content from C # SOLID architecture to F # from Akka.NET. <br><br>  Starting with a review of functional changes and new principles of system design, Vagif explains why the decision was made to switch to F # + Akka.NET, compares message driven development to the OOP, and shows how the new approach allowed us to avoid manual flow control and state control. shared access.  After that - another half an hour of analysis of the problems and solutions that were generated by the transition. <br><br>  At the end of the report, Vagif performs a <b>song about the life of an actor</b> (no, we are not on substances, he really did), which will allow you to remember everything he said before and shows examples of refactoring from C # to F #. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wRxO5ky7S8g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  In eighth place was Mikhail Shcherbakov's report ‚ÄúStrange affairs: vulnerabilities in the .NET platform‚Äù.  What types of vulnerabilities are found in the .NET Framework?  What could be the target of an attacker?  How does knowledge of typical attacks help develop protected applications?  Michael answers these questions, visually in the code showing examples of holes found in ASP .NET, .NET Remoting and in fresh .NET Core. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bL0U4CKVpu4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  In the seventh position, Filip W talk about the not very common topic of C # scripting.  We <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/322226"><b>interviewed Philip</b></a> on this subject, so I won't write much here.  From the core: Philip claims that due to the richness of the infrastructure, C # excels any other scripting language in efficiency.  Holivar?  Watch the video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/raO5BQahmlg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  What do we know about time?  Probably not as much as we would like.  And what do we know about the implementation of Date &amp; Time on .NET?  It turns out, is not all.  Ilya Fofanov in his report shows what the negligence in working with dates and time leads to: lack of dates when switching from one calendar to another, incorrect calculation of a person‚Äôs age, problems of planning future events, arithmetic on dates and time, and much more.  Of course, Illya also talks about how to avoid most of the problems and best practices. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/14l2JagZSlo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  In fifth place, we again have F # in the report by Roman Nevolin ‚ÄúF # to the glory of Data Science‚Äù, devoted to the capabilities of the functional .NET-language in working with big data: processing and analysis, interactive interaction and visualization.  The report has a review of not only the overview of the language, but also of the useful <s>bike</s> libraries: Fable, Deedle, Accord Framework, R provider and others. <br><br>  By the way, the report can be viewed even if you are with F # ‚Äúnot in the tooth with your foot‚Äù: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6r9aDfEI71U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  Moving on to hardcore cases - in fourth place is a report by Sasha <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/goldshtn/" class="user_link">goldshtn</a> Goldshtein, a performance engineer, the author of Pro .NET Performance, on how to extract maximum performance from iron: vectoring on parallel threads, optimizing your code in working with the latest instruction sets and cache structures.  On the tools that allow you to find and correct the "bottlenecks" in your algorithms without playing a guessing game. <br><br>  All this is demonstrated on living examples of building algorithms optimized by modern CPU and memory models in C #.  Report in English. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5jKLVGI3B4g" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  So we got to the top three.  It is opened by Dmitry Soshnikov, a technology evangelist of Microsoft, our regular speaker who consistently occupies the top lines of DotNext ratings, with a report on the creation of cognitive services. <br><br>  The report begins with a description of the developments of Microsoft in this area with examples, interesting demos and a detailed description of the API.  After that, Dmitry directly on the report writes a bot in the cloud. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rG0Sdzoljck" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  Andrei <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dreamwalker/" class="user_link">DreamWalker</a> Akinshin's report <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dreamwalker/" class="user_link">ranked</a> second, in which he continued the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dt8GuveyIV38"><b>topic of .NET arithmetic with DotNext 2017 Piter</b></a> , but if last time they were playful puzzle-makers, Moscow dealt with the fundamental theory and practical aspects of working with numbers. <br><br>  We discussed the accuracy of calculations and the speed of work on numbers, including those things that developers often do not think about: <br><br><ul><li>  Rake denormalized numbers; </li><li>  Features of ASM-code generation for the simplest arithmetic operations on the side of JIT-compilers; </li><li>  Unexpected consequences of minor changes in the source code for performance and accuracy of calculations. </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XEH0Hv54Fn8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><hr><br>  And in the first place we have, surprise-surprise, of course, Sasha Goldshtein with a report on the capabilities of WinDbg for a .NET developer.  From the report you will learn how to configure WinDbg so that it is more understandable and convenient;  how to work with WinDbg scripts and breakpoints;  about the tools for automating the work with the tool, as well as how to work with the performance remotely. <br><br>  Important note: 90% of the things described in the report cannot be done by Visual Studio. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8t1aTbnZ2CE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  See the video of all other reports on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLtWrKx3nUGBfBfOUlIA4xEF5MRzk9UbCQ">our YouTube channel</a> . <br><hr><br><h2>  <b>What's next?</b> </h2><br>  And then - DotNext 2017 Piter (May 19-20, 2017).  We looked at the ratings of all the reports and decided this time to reduce the hardcore degree, focusing on the technologies needed in the daily work of the .NET developer.  Of course, there will be something to listen to and performance, but most of the program is devoted to different areas: new frameworks, updates to familiar tools, the development of the right GUI and generally the right patterns and approaches. <br><br>  Let's talk about the Entity Framework Core, NuGet, Rider IDE, Xamarin.Forms and AvaloniaUI, REST frameworks - in general, see the <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/"><b>program, there are a lot of interesting things</b></a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/233/bb9/34a/233bb934aff248fd98a99c80c75fae8f.jpg"><br><br>  For each technology there will be an exhaustive overview, not in the style of "C ++ per hour", but sufficient to understand what is happening in a particular area.  <b>By the way, we already have 9 (!) MVP speakers, including Jon Skeet!</b> <br><br>  PS We still have several report slots in the program, if you have something to share - <b><a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/callforpapers/">submit a report to us</a></b> !  If there is no experience, we will help: put the speech, tell you about the correct structure of the report, do a few trainings - everything you need to ignite on the stage! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324038/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324038/</a></p>
