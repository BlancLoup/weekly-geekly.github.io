      But these days I often began to ask something like this <br><blockquote>  Hello!  Are you with PI HSE?  If yes, then you can answer a few questions about UI (I‚Äôm an applicant, I have to decide finally in the coming days). <br></blockquote><br><br>  And I thought, why not answer in detail and not put on Habr.  The questions are quite specific and refer to the first two courses. <br>  It is assumed that you are already familiar with <a href="http://hse.ru/">the HSE</a> and, in particular, with the <a href="http://se.hse.ru/rules">Faculty of UI</a> . <br>  This article was relevant a couple of years ago, now a lot has changed for the better, and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/217981/">Yandex and the Higher School of Economics are opening the faculty of Computer Science</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">Is it true that about half of UI students have 1 or more debts at the end of the session?</font>  <font color="0730a4">If so, what is the reason for this state of affairs?</font> </h4><br>  By the end of the year there will be even more. <br><br>  The reason is simple - people do not know where they are going.  Someone thought that the HSE is an ilitny ‚Ñ¢ university for the rich and there is no need to bot. <br><br>  Someone thought that PI is the same as Management or Logistics, only closer to the computer (and therefore closer to Dota2). <br><br>  Someone simply does not know how to program.  Bison, outline, write off ... PROGRAMS IN C #! <br><br>  By the way, some girls outlined the code in C #, and then wondered why nothing worked for them. <br><br><pre><code class="hljs php"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">Class</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">MainClass</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> </span></span>{ <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Public</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Static</span></span> Void Main (string[] args) { console.writeline(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"hello"</span></span>); } }</code> </pre> <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">At what level are programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãgiven?</font>  <font color="0730a4">Do they provide an in-depth understanding of patterns and anti-patterns, OOP, standard libraries?</font> </h4><br>  In the first year, only C # is taught from scratch to a very good level, including the GUI. <br><br>  Superficially do not slip in any way, the tests will drill deep. <br><br>  In the second year we have the first half of the year the Dutchman from <a href="http://www.tue.nl/">TU / e</a> via Skype (telepresence) gave lectures on Java. <br>  <a href="http://www.peeep.us/dc1f29f2">Software Construction for Higher School of Economics</a> ( <a href="http://www.peeep.us/efaf5d21">version 2012-2013</a> ). <br><br>  He taught Jave and Swing very competently and we saw the <strong>Big Project</strong> for several weeks, in principle a pretty good program turned out, you can believe it. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">Do they encourage you to write serious projects (especially in a team), or will this only happen on your own initiative?</font> </h4><br>  Yes, it is encouraged and this is all about.  In the third year, team assignments will be given, and in the fourth year we will be forced to have a team project. <br>  A lot of disciplines that are aimed at creating team spirit and the development of abilities to form such teams. <br><br>  This year (2011-2012, 2nd year) we did a team project - the creation of an Android application within the framework of the UU / UX course from TU / e. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">What kind of yap pass?</font> </h4><br><ul><li>  <strong>C #</strong> - all 1 course, the basis of the basics and the main filter against non-there; <br></li><li>  <strong>Java</strong> - half 2 courses; <br></li><li>  <strong>C ++</strong> - the entire second course.  Basically basic algorithms and STL containers, nothing productive; <br>  Homework and exam in the SSD5 (iCarnegie) course from Carnegie Mellon; <br>  After C # and Java, this is more boring, although now I know the difference between Vinograd matrix multiplication and Strassen. <br></li><li>  <strong>F #</strong> - optional, second half of the second course; <br></li><li>  <strong>Python</strong> - optional, summer practice in the first year; <br></li><li>  <strong>LaTeX</strong> - it is better to take a discrete mathematics in tech, and summer practice will go better; <br></li></ul><br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">I saw an example of a team project for UI students - a ‚Äúreading for the blind‚Äù program or something like that.</font> </h4><br><blockquote>  Was this project a pure initiative of the students, or was it done as a coursebook or something else?  How often do you do such things at the faculty (that is, really useful ones that you can even sell)? <br></blockquote><br>  It all depends on the people.  A lot of curts this year could be sold, someone even made freelancing for a real company, and then defended as a curc. <br><br>  Teamwork is a specific thing, this is not immediately learned.  Since the first courses teamwork means that someone is working, and the rest get credit. <br>  This makes it difficult to deduct the dunce, so the practice of team projects begins with the 2 course <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">Who teaches everything related to programming?</font>  <font color="0730a4">Have these people ever worked for serious companies?</font> </h4><br>  Differently.  Everything changes, how lucky.  Lectures on C # are read by <a href="http://www.hse.ru/org/persons/68153/">V. V. Podbelsky</a> himself, for example, I respect him. <br><br>  F # teaches Dmitry Soshnikov <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/shwars/" class="user_link">shwars</a> , evangelist from Microsoft. <br>  He is good at campaigning people, so everyone who has studied F # this year is very pleased. <br><br>  Java is <a href="http://www.hse.ru/org/persons/5487172/">run by the</a> most experienced <a href="http://www.hse.ru/org/persons/5487172/">Grinkrug E. M.</a> <br><br>  Construction and analysis of algorithms - <a href="http://www.hse.ru/org/persons/3807115">M. Ulyanov.</a> <br><br>  A head of the faculty (and conducts mathematical logic) <a href="http://www.hse.ru/org/persons/68174/">Avdoshin S. M.</a> , you can evaluate his contribution to science by reference. <br><br>  In general, with the staff at the HSE, everything is fine, I do not know a single teacher, who would not be a fan of his subject. <br><br>  If a person leads the economy, then this is necessarily an associate professor from the HSE Faculty of Economics. <br>  If programming - then some pros from the side. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">What is the real ‚Äúpartnership‚Äù with the University of Eindhoven?</font> </h4><br>  Is it real?  What is written on <a href="http://hse.ru/">hse.ru</a> , is the fact.  After the first year of the master's program, people are taken to <strong>TU / e</strong> for the second year, and the hostel and a lot of money are paid for a la scholarship for food.  At the end a person receives two diplomas, and is very much appreciated in the market.  By the way, at the same time you can work in the R &amp; D department of <strong>Phillips</strong> . <br><br>  Details may change, I described in general terms.  I have two more full years before that, but 10 people this year (2011-2012) have already successfully flown "there." <br><br>  Already, teachers from TU / e have been lecturing via Skype.  The first half of the second year, as I have already said, the Dutchman conducted Java, gave and checked homework, conducted tests and controls through their local system like ejudge. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.peeep.us/dc1f29f2">Software Construction for Higher School of Economics</a> ( <a href="http://www.peeep.us/efaf5d21">version 2012-2013</a> ). <br><br>  The second half of the year - interfaces and creation of applications for Android (they made a prototype of a thermostat with basic functionality). <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">‚ÄúPartnership‚Äù with the companies listed on the <a href="http://se.hse.ru/">se.hse.ru</a> website - what is it, what is the use for the student?</font> </h4><br>  I saw there two logos of the companies that offered summer practice with them this year (read the internship).  There is also a company logo, I know from there an employee who led the subject with us. <br><br>  HSE has cooperation with <strong>Microsoft</strong> - for example, for all Microsoft products except Office we have free full licenses - Visual Studio at least Ultimate, any Windows, even Server 2008 R2, and much more, about 100 titles (MSDN AA subscription). <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">The curriculum from <a href="http://se.hse.ru/">se.hse.ru</a> - is it true?</font> </h4><br>  <a href="http://www.hse.ru/standards/rup/archive/%3Ffid%3D24262">http://www.hse.ru/standards/rup/archive/?fid=24262</a> - plan. <br><br>  Corresponding, this is the actual plan (some disciplines of choice may not be, it depends on you).  Nevertheless, the plan changes for the better - new interesting disciplines are added. <br><br>  Two years ago, it all started with a basic plan <a href="http://files.kc.vc/hse/Struktura_BUP_BAK_PI.pdf">231000.62 HSE program and engineering</a> .  He hints at the essence a little, but the actual plan has successfully developed into something steeper. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">At the DOD, it was stated that in the HSE they try to ‚Äúprevent‚Äù students from working until the end of their studies.</font>  <font color="0730a4">What can you say about this?</font> </h4><br>  Here you need to clarify.  PI is the faculty of HSE, but I would not generalize rumors and principles about HSE as a whole to this faculty.  There is your leadership, your plans and even a separate campus. <br>  <em>Remove, at ns zds atsfrey ...</em> <br><br>  So, this statement does not apply to PI at all.  We have the opposite, from the second year of summer practice, students are sent to large companies for internship.  Everything possible is being done to develop team building skills and business skills in students so that by the third year we can come up with our startup and start it with the support of HSE. <br><br>  We have here an incubator of successful people, you probably did not understand the essence of the phrase.  Maybe it meant that HSE does not allow students to hang out in offices like plankton?  :) <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">Summer practice - where, for how long, was it good, what did you do?</font> </h4><br>  The first course this year (2011-2012) was an intern at the faculty - <strong>LaTeX</strong> , <strong>Matlab</strong> , they were trained in competent scientific work. <br>  When I was in the first year, we built <strong>UML</strong> diagrams and described interaction processes (for our own coursework). <br><br>  The second course this year was an internship in companies, the most popular was <strong>PingWin Sofware</strong> , this company won a tender for the creation of the Russian OS based on open source software.  We happened to pick up RPM-packages in <a href="https://abf.rosalinux.ru/">ABF</a> from <a href="http://www.rosalab.ru/">ROSA</a> .  Corrected errors in <strong>.spec</strong> files, cognized Zen Maintainer. <br><br>  I think the further, the more companies will be available.  The faculty of PI, which was created in the direction of "231000.62 Software Engineering" exists only 3 years (before PI was a sub-faculty of BI and the goals were different). <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">Optional disciplines.</font>  <font color="0730a4">Is your choice the law?</font> </h4><br>  Law.  If no one enrolled in the discipline - they cancel it (ha ha ha). <br><br>  This year we did not have diffur of choice, for at least 15 people. <br>  In the past year, limited by rating, selecting those who are higher.  But after a heap of complaints to the school from this year, <strong>who first managed to choose - that and sneakers</strong> . <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">Coursework?</font> </h4><br><blockquote>  What did you do as a term paper (all courses in order)? <br>  What kind of useful programs did you write for each year of study and on which PL? <br></blockquote><br>  Each course is a finished product.  There is a statement of the problem (you are free to choose it yourself or even to offer it), then, within the framework of <strong>Introduction to Software Engineering,</strong> you draw up with the scientific adviser TK in accordance with GOST, and then a set of documents in accordance with GOST ‚Äî an operator's manual, an explanatory note, and others. <br><br>  When I was in my first year, we were told about Microsoft Project and taught how to build Gant charts, we even distributed resources.  All as part of the course. <br><br>  By the course required presentation and protection.  You determine the complexity of the course yourself - you can do something banal and useless, but you can actually create a product, patent it, write a scientific paper based on the work done and much more. <br><br>  In the first year, you can only write in C # (it doesn‚Äôt matter for what), for the rest - what you want. <br><br>  For reference, my coursework: <br><br>  <strong>1 year</strong> - Emulator Turing Machines, the task was set due to the fact that there were no programs on the Internet that would satisfy the needs of the faculty.  Now this emulator pervaki chase.  In addition to this emulator, other guys did coursework, which later began to be used at the faculty. <br><br>  <strong>2 year</strong> - I asked the supervisor to give me a topic on hardcore.  Received as requested.  We didn‚Äôt even come up with the name immediately, and what happened turned out to be far from the terminology used in the west to describe such things. <br><ul><li>  Computing operations in idempotent semiring on cone-constrained sets program; <br></li><li>  What can be attributed to Event Systems; <br></li><li>  Materials: <a href="http://files.kc.vc/coursework/minmaxgd/about.pdf">Documentation</a> (on the first page is a stub) and <a href="http://files.kc.vc/coursework/minmaxgd/presentation.pdf">Presentation</a> with protection; <br></li><li>  The program in Java, in two parts, has no practical application yet. <br></li></ul><br><br>  References for coursework for the second year (approximately 20% of read and meaningful) <br><ul><li>  F.

This is one of the bricks for admission to the magistracy, for example.  And why?  Because the supervisor, it is primarily a colleague and he is interested in your development. <br><br>  By the way, in both cases, I used only the knowledge gained during my studies in C # and Java at the university.  Rather, I passed tests and had to have this knowledge, 100% control. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">At what level are non-programming items given (humanitarian)?</font> </h4><br>  Depends on the profile of humanitarianism.  I was extremely indignant at how we were hammered by microeconomics.  Fortunately, for me it is over. <br><br>  Another thing is psychology.  In general, many humanitarian things are trying to tell us in relation to IT.  In the case of psychology, this was an extremely useful experience, since we were led by an IT-savvy professional <a href="http://www.hse.ru/org/persons/9959502">Mandrikova E.Yu.</a>  with a full understanding of our interests. <br><br>  By the way, humanitarian aid in the first year is not enough, which is good news. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">Can I take the discipline in advance?</font> </h4><br>  Not.  With rare exceptions, you can write the exam a little earlier, especially before the winter holidays.  Or summer practice in advance to pass.  There is also an option to get a gun, having worked well for a year.  But you need to work for a year, yes. <br><br>  In general, we study here, and not get crusts.  This is me about PI specifically. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">Do they monitor attendance of classes?</font>  <font color="0730a4">If so, in what form?</font> </h4><br>  Each teacher follows his own way, but there are general principles.  There are lectures, and there are seminars - a list is filled in the seminars, in which students are active (and attending, yeah).  The lectures are usually celebrated at the beginning of the year, then everyone bothers. <br><br>  Items are different.  In the first year I tried not to skip anything extra.  In the second year, almost everyone begins to score lectures and go only to seminars (I mean unimportant subjects).  You will also be told that the seminars cannot be broken through, since the very essence and material for the exams and checklists are told on them.  It really is. <br><br>  We have here the principle that there is no ‚Äú <em>wtf ?!</em>  <em>O_o</em> ‚Äù, all tasks are sorted out along and across, the main thing is not to lose interest. <br><br>  By the way, on humanitarian subjects (psychology, type), it is the attendance and work at seminars that is evaluated. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">What items can safely skip?</font> </h4><br>  In the first year you should not score at all.  At this faculty with freshmen special treatment.  First, gain surplus, and then deduct half. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">Deduction - under what conditions?</font> </h4><br>  Deduction is just like two fingers in the sand.  The year is divided into 4 modules. <br>  Thus, there are 4 sessions per year.  The scores are ten, below 4 - not. <br><br>  <strong>Life cycle</strong> <br><ol><li>  Actually exam </li><li>  Retake (the same teacher) </li><li>  Commission (strictly to other teachers) </li></ol><br><br>  <strong>Ways to get missed</strong> <br><ul><li>  To be late with the filing of documents - for example, in time not to declare the topic of coursework or WRC; <br></li><li>  Get fail by formula (see below). <br></li></ul><br><br>  The final score can be a heap of criteria, usually weighted. <br>  <strong>EVALUATION = 0.2 * 1 MODULE + 0.7 * CU + 0.1 * EKZ</strong> <br><br>  By this formula, it is immediately clear that the exam can be written perfectly well, but this will give only 1/10 of the grade.  Yes, there were such failures. <br><br>  Now simple arithmetic - if a session received 3 failures or more, this is a deduction on the machine.  With no exceptions.  Money does not take. <br><br>  Bad luck can retake.  Retake takes place in the winter after the winter session and in the fall.  That is, spring nezachi can not be retaken until the fall, so 4 module is such an extreme, because if the two tails are already hanging ... I do not envy. <br><br>  <strong>How to deal with failures, if a lot of money</strong> <br><ol><li>  Buy a certificate of illness <br><ul><li>  Cheap; <br></li><li>  They can burn, then hold on; <br></li><li>  You can buy information after the fact (if already conveyor and communication :)). <br></li></ul><br></li><li>  Buy an individual plan <br><ul><li>  First you need to transfer to a paid one; <br></li><li>  A plan is possible only if there is no party 2 or less; <br></li><li>  The plan delays retake for 1 year, but the tail is hanging. <br></li></ul><br></li></ol><br>  We have people in whom they shoot, and they are still alive.  Go, you know, in two plans, it would be better to buy a car. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">How many people are left from the original composition to this point?</font> </h4><br>  After the first course, <strong>49</strong> out of <strong>97</strong> remained.  So, yes. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">Mathematics not related to programming directly (matan, linal, difury, etc.)</font> </h4><br>  Linal we had the first three modules.  Matan was our first year.  There is no difur at all. <br>  Something like this. <br><br>  Linal taught <a href="http://www.hse.ru/org/persons/4194475/">Chubarov I.A.</a>  , wonderful man.  He is from the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, and Linal also leads at MehMat MSU.  Judging by the site, the campaign is already a full-time associate professor of HSE. <br><br>  Matan led <a href="http://www.hse.ru/org/persons/65002/">Chubarova EI</a> , they together.  :) <br><br>  On matane and linal, they tell the very base, explain as much as possible, give standard tasks and then check on the exam. <br><br>  The exam is usually taken by the <em>number of</em> tasks.  Allowing to use everything - I pre-made a model version in advance and made up a plan for solving problems in a notebook, usually it‚Äôs not enough time. <br><br>  There is no more fundamental mathematics.  More precisely, you can get it at will - curtain to come up with a tough one, at the second course you will be subtracted at will, difuru at will, protection of information at will and so on. <br><br>  In short, we study with the expectation of self-study as necessary, forcibly do not push the "fundamental" things. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">Mathematics related to programming directly?</font> </h4><br>  She was full.  Discrete mathematics, led <a href="http://www.hse.ru/org/persons/10586198/">Lazarev A. A.</a> - Doctor of Science from MIPT.  Mathematical logic, the theory of automata and formal languages, computational geometry ... <br><br>  All math subjects related to programming are, and will be, see curricula. <br>  That's all right. <br><br><h4>  <font color="0730a4">Instead of conclusion</font> </h4><br>  I hope these answers will help you with the choice of the university in which you have to sit for 4 or 6 years. <br><br>  As for the decor, we study in a newly constructed building.  6 elevators and 9 floors.  All chairs are soft (such black).  All boards are white marker, All desks are whole (hungry students eat in the dining room, not wood).  All toilets are clean.  All the work on cleaning the premises, repairing the premises are done on the external resource, this leads to the good quality of such works.
