But in fact, such a thing often turns out to be a trick.

      An example of this is the container data center Sun BlackBox, widely distributed for several years ago, which the Russian customer then got rid of at the first opportunity - and now he doesn‚Äôt want to hear more about the container concept.  And all because the stand-up price in the container turned out to be exorbitant, the deployment time was comparable to the duration of the construction of a traditional data center, and the customer was not at all needed for the widely advertised mobility.  Why was this solution chosen?  The explanation is in the magic of the brand. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Meanwhile, in recent years, quite high-quality models of domestic-manufactured container data centers have appeared on the Russian market.  For example, the bill for the supply of container solutions of the company Telecore, which are produced at the plant in Tomsk and have proven themselves in various climatic latitudes of our country and abroad, has exceeded one hundred. <br><br>  Another example: GreenMDC modular solutions for outdoor and indoor use are reminiscent of the fact that Russia has traditionally been strong by designers and inventors.  Domestic talents take care of their name and strive to ensure that their products serve customers for a long time.  (One of these modules, GreenMDC Indoor24, became the basis of the commercial data center of the MIRAN company.) <br>  It remains only to dream that such times will come when the internal filling of domestic modules will be based on the decisions of Russian equipment suppliers. <br><br>  Of course, it would be unwise, and it is impossible to completely abandon the fruits of the advanced thought of the global industry of data centers.  But the Russian market follows the saying "Road spoon for dinner."  As long as electricity prices remained low, data center operators did not particularly care about investing in energy-saving technologies.  It was more important not to lose time, get ahead of competitors, to seize valuable market shares. <br><br>  Even five to seven years ago, data centers that were cheaper in terms of capital expenditures, but more expensive to operate cooling systems, were introduced in data centers.  However, as soon as the electricity tariffs were raised, free-cooling technologies, adiabatic systems, a Kyoto wheel and much more immediately appeared on the scene. <br><br>  However, here we have to keep our ears open: each technology has its own niche of use and, if misused, instead of saving costs, it can turn into ruin.  About this is the article by Mikhail Balkarov "Freedom or the conscious need for" free cooling. " <br><br>  Two technologies - container data centers and free cooling - became the themes of the current issue of TsODy.RF magazine.  It would seem that in common between them?  Principle of use: whatever innovative technologies are offered to the customer, they should be approached with a cool head and sober calculation.  Try to calculate a few steps forward, how much will the maintenance of such a system cost and what are the real payback periods. <br><br>  A specific task is dealt with in the section ‚ÄúDesigning a Fire Extinguishing System‚Äù.  Three experts comment on approaches to its solution. <br>  In the current issue of the journal, the reader will find detailed answers of the expert of ‚ÄúAMDtechology‚Äù to the complex questions that confront the designer every day.  Thanks to the cooperation with specialists of this level, TsODy.RF magazine has turned into an expert platform, a kind of textbook, interesting for all participants of this market. <br><br>  Natalya Zhilkina, Chief Editor <br><br>  The full contents of the issue can be found on the site <a href="http://dcjournal.ru/archive/ed7/">TsODy.RF ‚Ññ7</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221529/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221529/</a></p>
