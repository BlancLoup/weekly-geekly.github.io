Software for generating the main contour lines and counting them has been around for almost 50 years.  However, medium horizontals are drawn only where there is a place and it makes sense to show relief.  A version for ArcGIS can be found <a href="">on GItHub</a> . </li><li>  With the support of a number of large companies, the Linux Foundation has <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/linux-foundation-supports-community-development-to-improve-mobility-transportation-safety-and-infrastructure-with-new-urban-computing-foundation-2019-05-15">created a</a> new foundation, the Urban Computing Foundation.

Nevertheless, you need to go a long way, since Android <a href="https://osmand.net/blog/osmand-3-3-released">version 3.30 was</a> published in March 2019. </li></ul><br><h2>  Mapping </h2><br><ul><li>  Osmose now <a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/osmose_qa/status/1126102401616896000">uses</a> MapCSS-based <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapCSS">OpenRailwayMap</a> project validation <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/MapCSS">rules</a> to verify railway infrastructure. </li><li>  Dr. Erin Ryan discovered <a href="https://twitter.com/erinleeryan/status/1125939318638424064">several gaps and errors</a> in OpenStreetMap around the city of Charlottesville (Va.) While attempting to geocoding arrest information.  Several points were identified that signify a prison, as well as the lack of clarification of ‚ÄúAdvanced‚Äù on some roads, for example, on <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/42169173">Avon Street</a> . </li><li>  Not so long ago, Christopher Beddou of Mapillary traveled and was lucky: he found good weather in Scotland, and therefore <a href="https://twitter.com/cbed32/status/1124238906986307585">filmed</a> several magnificent landscapes. </li><li>  In the golf simulator, <a href="https://twitter.com/iandees/status/1127556847190278144">due to the</a> use of data from OSM, it is possible to display fairly accurately the fields for this game. </li><li>  Nick Bolten <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2019-May/045097.html">wants to</a> change the way he uses pedestrian crossings, because he believes that the existing tag <code>crossing=*</code> not quite true in terms of orthogonality, understanding and semantics.  With his sentence ( <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/crossing%253Dmarked"><code>crossing=marked</code></a> ) he stirred up the wasp nest: this tag is already in iD, but its use is only being <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/tagging/2018-October/040245.html">discussed</a> . </li><li>  Quincy Morgan, one of the developers of the online editor iD, <a href="https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD/issues/6332">introduced a</a> new tag - <code>nonsquare=yes</code> .  He suggests using it for buildings where some or all of the angles are not straight.  The idea is to thus avoid the display of such buildings when checking for errors.  Quincy Morgan was asked to discuss the introduction of this tag with the OSM community, but he ignored it.  This behavior is <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk/2019-May/082506.html">criticized by</a> several users on the Talk mailing list. </li><li>  TBKMrt <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Proposed_features/toll">wants to</a> expand the range of values ‚Äã‚Äãfor the key <code>toll=*</code> , which is now used in 98.98% of cases only with Yes / No values.  He suggests complicating the key type to <code>toll=&lt;COUNTRY CODE&gt;:&lt;TYPE&gt;</code> , where the values ‚Äã‚Äãof &lt;TYPE&gt; can be as follows: <em>fee</em> (fee), <em>vignette</em> (toll road), <em>meter</em> (parking <em>meter</em> ) or <em>no</em> (no).  The key <code>toll:type=</code> can also be used with <em>distance</em> (distance) or <em>time</em> (time) values. </li></ul><br><h2>  switch2OSM </h2><br><ul><li>  OpenStreetMap US <a href="https://twitter.com/OpenStreetMapUS/status/1125813052459376641">published a</a> link to the <a href="https://www.apnews.com/6f621c1c54734d0b95d374556c2cf5c0">Associated Press</a> article on how data from the US Census Bureau, Cal Fire and OpenStreetMap were combined to assess escape routes during fires. </li></ul><br><h2>  Community </h2><br><ul><li>  Osmer from Germany <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/dktue/">dktue</a> <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-at/2019-May/009875.html">inquired</a> (automatically <a href="https://lists.openstreetmap.org/pipermail/talk-at/2019-May/009875.html">translated</a> ) in the Austrian Talk newsletter why postal codes are not recorded in Austria throughout the country, as is done in Germany.  During the discussion, it turned out that he was talking about the designation of postal codes through drawing multipolygons, which cannot be so easily implemented in Austria, since the necessary data are missing. </li><li>  The famous Russian Osmer Ilya Zverev began to produce a podcast about GIS technologies - <a href="https://mapokalypse.podster.fm/">‚ÄúCartoklipsis‚Äù</a> (in Russian).  In each issue, he, Sergey Golubev and Maxim Dubinin (CEO of <a href="http://nextgis.ru/">NextGIS</a> ) discuss one specific topic related to GIS.  In the penultimate release, called <a href="https://mapokalypse.podster.fm/4">OpenStreetMap Kills</a> , they talked about the negative impact of OSM. </li><li>  alexkemp studied the flow of spam (30 thousand messages per day), which appeared in OSM diaries from the end of April.
