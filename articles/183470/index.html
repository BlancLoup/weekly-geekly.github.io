Restore playlist</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/242/a29/191/242a291916eac3472e12ddf813a13b39.png"><br><br>  If you have blocked several of your favorite tracks and you don‚Äôt want to leave the VKontakte audio recordings, there is a way out.  In connection with the blocking of audio recordings, this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/183386/">topic</a> has become popular.  Some believe that ‚Äúmusic‚Äù is a powerful argument in order to use VKontakte.  In this article I will tell you how I tried to restore the blocked songs, so that they do not fall out of the playlists. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Title </h4><br>  Already a lot of jokes were born, about the changes in the name of the composition.  If you try to download a song with modified or erased <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3_(%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5)">metadata</a> , then the download window will report an error.  I dare to suggest that even if you change the name of a song on VKontakte, it will still be blocked.  So, it makes no sense to change the name of the song. <br><br><h4>  Content </h4><br>  Now it is obvious that the content of the audio files is checked.  There are many mixes of different tracks, which, unlike the original ones, are not blocked.  For happiness, it remains only to learn the algorithm for checking the songs for originality.  The first thing that came to mind was to cut the silence at the end and try to load it.  This, in my opinion, is the most harmless thing that can be done with an audio file.  Oddly enough - it did not help.  It is understandable that in many audio files there is a long and unnecessary silence at the end.  And it would be foolish to leave the opportunity to simply cut it.  Just in case, I tried to cut the silence in the beginning, which also did not bring success. <br>  It became known that the file is checked only in the main part - without silence at the beginning and at the end.  It is very sad to cut a piece from your favorite song.  Therefore, you need to know the minimum cut off.  In this case, you can change the record so that the human ear and not notice.  For example, select two vertices and remove the gap between them.

Most likely, the audio file is greatly ‚Äúsimplified‚Äù and compared with the same patterns of original songs. <br><br><h4>  Quality </h4><br>  It turned out that you can get around the error in another way, without cutting anything.  It is enough to slightly lower the quality of the recording. <br>  To solve this problem, I identified 2 approaches: <br><ul><li>  Convert an audio file a couple of times with the same quality parameters as the current ones. </li><li>  To drastically reduce the quality of the recording, setting the parameters in the converter is worse than the current ones. </li></ul><br>  As a result, it is possible to pass the test and at the same time, the quality of the recording, for the human ear, will not differ.  For some files that you have downloaded somewhere, it will be enough to convert them once into the same format. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I prefer the method of cutting out, as it spoils the quality of the track less. <br>  There is a big chance that the algorithm for checking audio records will change after a while. <br>  I think that the music is not deleted, since some scripts still display information about the bit-rate and the size of the song file.  If this is the case, then it will probably be possible to play the locked recordings through the script. <br>  If you wish, you can share in the comments services such as audio recordings on VKontakte.  For me personally, the big plus was a free and extensive database of tracks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183470/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183470/</a></p>
