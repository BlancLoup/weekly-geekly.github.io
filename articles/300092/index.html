I found it only one, the rest began to search on the left side of the screen and in the search field.  Over the years, I realized that people do not scan the entire page - they <a href="http://www.gerrymcgovern.com/new-thinking/block-reading-how-we-read-web">divide</a> its contents into blocks and view only them. <br><br><hr><br><br><br><br>  The effect of scanning extends to print publications: books, magazines, brochures.  The study of this feature <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/serious-reading-takes-a-hit-from-online-scanning-and-skimming-researchers-say/2014/04/06/088028d2-b5d2-11e3-b899-20667de76985_story.html">told the</a> Washington Post.  Neuroscientists are concerned that the alternative way of reading is already competing with the classic deep immersion in the text, which has been formed for thousands of years. <br><br><br><br>  It is not so much worrying that it has become more difficult for people to focus on reading fiction, but how it affects the ability to absorb new information at work and at school.  The human brain was not originally designed for reading, so we quickly retrain to perceive the text.  On paper, we read page by page, and on the Internet we snatch text with chunks from different sites, switching attention from one topic to another. <br><br><br><br>  This heat map from the Chartbeat and Slate.com study shows areas of the article that are read more and less ( <a href="http://www.videodim.com/Eye%2520gaze%2520Patterns.html">study results</a> ).

The main principle: if you can show, do not write.  Accompany articles with images, infographics, videos, examples of documents - show.  Do not make people read. <br><br><br><br>  Neil Patel, Amazon, NBC, HP marketing founder and founder of KISSmetrics, <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2016/01/visitors-read-article/">advises</a> not to worry too much about this and gives instructions: <br><ul><li>  Do not worry that not everyone will read the article.  It is important that the most interested read it. </li><li> Know the audience: who specifically needs to read the article. </li><li>  Create content that helps solve the problems of your audience. </li></ul><br><br><br><br><h2>  How to choose a title </h2><br>  In the text ‚ÄúWhat I understand about content marketing when I analyzed 614 materials‚Äù ( <a href="https://blog.relap.io/2015/12/03/neil_patel_614/">translated by Relap.io</a> ) Neil Patel writes: ‚ÄúSubstantial headlines work better in the long run.  I looked at all the headlines in <a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/blog/">Quick Sprout</a> ( <em>Patel's blog about content marketing - approx. Relap.io</em> ) and noticed that some of them are very vague, while others are very specific.  Blurry headlines like ‚Äú <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2008/11/23/4-ways-you-can-become-rich/">How to become rich</a> ‚Äù receive an average of 44% more traffic from email.  But texts with more specific headings gain 29.1% more reposts on social networks. <br><br><br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen I studied long-term data, for a year or more, I found that meaningful headlines take much longer places and generally receive 65.2% more traffic.  In general, when I follow my heading <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/07/03/the-formula-for-a-perfect-headline/">rules</a> , I get more traffic. ‚Äù <br><br><br><br><br><h2>  What to write about </h2><br>  ‚ÄúMy most popular posts are mostly personal and at the same time ambiguous stories.  For example: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/12/10/how-spending-162301-42-on-clothes-made-me-692500/">Having spent $ 162.3 thousand on clothes, I earned $ 692.5 thousand</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/12/15/how-a-ferrari-made-me-a-million-bucks/">How I earned a million dollars on Ferrari</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2014/10/22/what-spending-57000-on-instagram-taught-me/">What I learned by spending $ 57,000 on Instagram</a> . </li></ul><br>  These three stories attracted many users.  After publication, I received many evil letters and comments and in many cases could be wrong, but this is normal.  However, these texts became the most popular on my blog. ‚Äù <br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  <strong>People judge you by the headlines of your publications.</strong>  <strong>Many do not read further: they simply make assumptions based on the title.</strong> </h2><br><br><hr><br><br><br><br>  As a guide to genres, you can use Patel's material ‚ÄúWhat to write in the company's blog: a detailed guide to 15 types of materials‚Äù ( <a href="https://blog.relap.io/2016/01/20/15_content_types_from_patel/">translation by Relap.io</a> ). <br><br><br><br>  Articles that remain relevant for several months or even years convert visitors into customers better.  They usually include high-frequency keywords. <br><br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/da0/f7e/8d2/da0f7e8d25bd7ce5c8f3c0760dfc64c3.png"></a> <br><br><br><br>  Amazon makes 57% of book sales due to high-frequency queries.  WPBeginner increased its traffic by 20% in two months with the help of ‚Äútweeters‚Äù.  The company KISSmetrics in 2012 brought 142,000 visitors to its site thanks to high-frequency queries.  Do not forget about keywords when making content. <br><br><br><br>  More cases can be read in the material "7 examples of how companies improve efficiency with the help of content with high-frequency search queries." <br><br><br><br><br><h2>  How to choose the right time </h2><br>  Your text may not be seen, the article will not be recognized, the letter will not be opened if you make a publication at the wrong time.  In social networks, the material may be lost due to the algorithms of news feeds, and the letter will be among hundreds of similar ones. <br><br><br><br>  According to the company Hubspot, which develops services for Internet marketing, 80% of emails are sent on business days, but more openness is in letters that arrive on weekends.  You can write to people when they are most active, on weekdays.  On the other hand, if you send a letter on a day off, it has more chances to be read: it is not lost among others. <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/901/d79/4cc/901d794ccf2a6cc6a93116539af66bd7.png" width="680"></a> <br><br><br><br>  And the results of the UniSender study showed less openability of letters at the weekend: <br><br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/605/812/ea6/605812ea6c14138bb59b832ba01e5f65.png"></a> <br><br>  In general, it is not yet clear.  Share your experiences in the comments. <br><br><br><br><br><h2>  The openness of email-mailing depends on the industry </h2><br>  Most of the letters of your newsletter will not read.  Humble yourself. <br><br><br><br>  On SmartInsights published detailed statistics of email-mailings with a comparison by industry and country.  In the first column - the industry companies that make mailing.  The following is the average open rate of their letters, then the highest and lowest rates.  The best of all are the letters of travel companies, and the worst of all are news publications: <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c07/d32/d4b/c07d32d4b06e540076e649639b373a2e.png"></a> <br>  <em>Opening letters in different business areas</em> <br><br><br>  Hubspot talks about three major mistakes that prevent emails from reading: <br><ul><li>  The subject of the letter does not match the objectives. </li><li>  You send letters at the wrong time. </li><li>  You send letters on behalf of the company, and not on your own behalf. </li></ul><br><br><br>  Deaconess Health System Content Webmaster David Huffman <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2011/01/email-marketing-case-study/">described</a> how he improved the opening rate of email messages in six weeks.  Four main conclusions: <br><ul><li>  Your subscribers will not open letters more often if they start receiving them more often. </li><li>  Subjects of letters with a clear appeal work better by 20%.  For example, a letter with the subject ‚ÄúPlan a Campus Tour‚Äù opens better than ‚ÄúTake a Campus Tour‚Äù. </li><li>  Recipients are more likely to open letters with success stories. </li><li>  The main thing - you need more content.  In six weeks, we earned on cold leads through enhanced content: blog articles, two e-books, video stories of success, and invitations to events. </li></ul><br><br><br>  Read about four more companies that managed to make their letters open more often with specific examples. <br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  <strong>They did not adapt the page for mobile devices - they lost half of the audience.</strong> </h2><br><br><hr><br><br>  First, Google improves search sites that are convenient to use from mobile devices.  Secondly, smartphones now have as many users as desktops. <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f72/050/c3a/f72050c3ad3cb0c1bd7e5517ddfd806b.png"></a> <br><br><br>  More importantly, up to half of visitors to content projects read them from mobile devices. <br><br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/28b/7d5/fae/28b7d5fae0b65ad9787f0a423b31ffca.jpg" width="680"></a> <br><br><br><br>  According to the Pew Research Center, smartphone users <a href="http://www.journalism.org/chart/ten-digital-news-outlets-had-more-mobile-time-than-desktop-per-visit/">spend</a> more time on news sites than visitors from desktops.  The chart data on major American media: <br><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/8e7/b6b/5f0/8e7b6b5f01c2a458b07002738e7866a7.jpg" width="680"></a> <br><br><br>  Another feature of mobile traffic: visitors <a href="https://twitter.com/lukew/status/629694224535957504/">start to</a> scroll the page before it has loaded.

Emotions are important. <br><br><br><br>  Debi Williams, co-founder of the marketing company SPROUT Content, <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2013/09/branded-content-make-emotional-connection/">advises</a> how to add emotion to branded content, and gives examples: <br><ul><li>  Write in ordinary language, as people say. </li><li>  Create something that others want to join. </li><li>  Be honest. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/d42/a38/881/d42a38881ef4e40484f1a9afc77abe0f.png" width="680"><br><br><br>  People think about anything, but not about your brand.  To write interesting, try the technique ‚Äú <a href="https://blog.relap.io/2015/11/12/so_what/">So what?</a>  ".  It helps to solve the daily problems of people with the help of services and products - to fill your texts with practical sense. <br><br><br><br>  Engage your readers in content creation or push them to the reaction.  Hobby consumers <a href="http://contentmarketinginstitute.com/2016/03/funnel-create-content-research/">stay</a> with the brand longer and make repeat purchases. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3f3/0b5/aaf/3f30b5aaf827f534b30d6acf2ada809e.jpg" width="680"></a> <br>  <em>Correlation of customer engagement and its life cycle for a brand</em> <br><br><br><br><h2>  Guest postings increase blog credibility. </h2><br>  <a href="http://socialmarketingwriting.com/how-to-build-a-credible-blog-infographic/">A study of</a> Social Marketing Writing about trusting blogs says that: <br><ul><li>  The very presence of a blog on the site increases the credibility of the brand among 68.52% of consumers. </li><li>  Blogs that publish articles by different authors cause more confidence among 62.96% of visitors. </li></ul><br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a35/b88/0a6/a35b880a6bfa6507405cfc3a8458e5b2.jpg" width="680"></a> <br><br><br>  Therefore, it makes sense to involve third-party authors.  In addition, you can try to <a href="http://neilpatel.com/2016/02/13/why-guest-blogging-is-the-best-inbound-marketing-strategy-a-data-driven-answer/">publish</a> articles in other people's blogs.  This will expand the audience. <br><br><br><br><br><h2>  How to publish on third-party sites </h2><br>  Guest blogging is not as effective as it was before, because now it makes no sense to publish articles on many blogs for links.  But you need to place high-quality articles on the sites where your audience is.  Find sites from your niche that post guest publications and check their credibility. <br><br><br><br>  Go to <a href="https://moz.com/researchtools/ose/">OSE</a> - the MOZ online service for SEO site analysis - and check your domain authority.  The higher the score, the better.  Even if the blog has a low indicator, but it is regularly updated - write text for it. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/7b4/df4/af7/7b4df4af793da894b3466e26861b01c8.jpg"><br>  <em>Vc.ru indicators</em> <br><br><br>  Evaluate whether there is traffic.  Ask for advice from a colleague who published on the site.  Do people actively comment on articles?  Does the blog have authority in narrow circles?

Email us at ads@relap.io. <br><br><br><br><br><h2>  Main rules </h2><br><ul><li>  Readers divide pages into conditional blocks and scan only theirs with a glance. </li><li>  On paper texts read the same. </li><li>  Dilute text with images, infographics, video.  Do not write if you can show. </li><li>  If your content is shared - it does not mean that it is read. </li><li>  It is important that the article is not read by everyone, but by the most interested. </li><li>  Write ambiguous and personal stories. </li><li>  People love emotional materials and share them more often. </li><li>  Substantial headlines work better in the long run. </li><li>  High-frequency keywords can bring a lot of traffic. </li><li>  Each business area has its own rules for emails, but if you are involved in entertainment and tourism, you are lucky. </li><li>  If it is inconvenient to read from a smartphone, you have lost half of the readers. </li><li>  Invite authors and experts to publish your article.  This will increase confidence. </li><li>  Publish to third-party sites where there is an active audience. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300092/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300092/</a></p>
