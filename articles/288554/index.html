      On January 4 and 5, rumors spread about the death of the spiritual leader of Iranian clerics Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on the Internet and, in particular, in the blogosphere.  Iranian media keep silence, official confirmation or denial of this information has not yet been.  The question of whether Khamenei is alive or dead has hung in the air.  The beginning of these rumors was put by Michael Ledin, a senior analyst at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, who reported on the death of Khamenei in his <a href="http://pajamasmedia.com/xpress/michaelledeen/%25202007/01/06/more_on_khamenei.php">online diary</a> .  No details followed, but Ledin‚Äôs solid professional reputation contributed to the widespread dissemination of this information on blogs.  As a result, it turned out that all these rumors were greatly exaggerated, but many news agencies, as they say, were led and with might and main called the death of the ayatollah.  Ledin apologized for the message of unverified information and complained about the difficulties of receiving news from Iran. <br><br>  Experts of Trend Micro, a specialist in Internet security, concluded that in 2007, the focus of hackers will be on virtual diaries (blogs) and instant messaging programs (ICQ, MSN), from which you can steal personal information.  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TECH/internet/%252012/12/cyber.crime.reut/index.html">According to</a> experts, lone hackers become an anachronism, giving way to professional groups.  The hacking motives will also change.  Banal money theft is a thing of the past.  Few of those who like chatting on ICQ suspect that his innocent conversation with friends opens up the way for the hacker to the data stored on the computer.  Meanwhile, hacking ICQ is becoming an increasingly attractive method for hackers.  After all, people have become much more cautious about ordinary spam.  Another ‚Äúparadise‚Äù for a hacker is online blogs.  The main danger for Russian bloggers is the publication in the profiles of their email addresses and other personalized information, which can be used for a ‚Äútargeted‚Äù attack on a user. <br><br>  Companies are looking for new ways to attract customers and some are paying attention to blogs.  A little-known design firm deda.ru decided to draw the attention of some " <a href="http://www.deda.ru/blogshow">Blog Show</a> ".  Here is what the inventors write themselves: ‚ÄúStudio's blog show is an interactive show based on diaries (blogs) of key employees of the company being created. Anyone can put their nose into the designer‚Äôs kitchen, evaluate whether there is enough pepper when communicating with customers add your fly in the ointment or honey in the barrel with assessments of what is happening or try to stir the composition of the participants every week. "  Well, I will follow the idea and then I will inform you about the results.  Although, in my opinion, the idea is interesting, but kind of sluggish. <br><br>  Famous bloggers get on the pages of not only our newspaper, but the <a href="http://kbke.livejournal.com/3876796.html">Rolling Stones</a> , and even " <a href="http://www.sb.by/article.php%3FarticleID%3D56090">Soviet Belorussia</a> ".  Although, after publication in the Rolling Stones, a <a href="http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/850088.html">scandal</a> has already <a href="http://dolboeb.livejournal.com/850088.html">broken up</a> in connection with the distortion of the words of the participants in the interview.  Well, in the SB, they just quietly and patriotically rejoice at the luck of their compatriot: ‚ÄúYoung Belarusian writer Tatyana Zamirovskaya started an online diary (blog) three days ago in LJ. Recently Tanya claimed the main award in the Russian segment of LiveJournal - the Rykov award in the nomination Writer of the year. ‚ÄùAlas, our blogger, Ekaterina Velikina, walked over our Tanya. We are talking about competition in LJ and, generally, the Russian-speaking blogosphere phenomenon with experienced LJ-user Zamirovskaya. By the way, Tanya was ahead of such well-known authors during internet voting  in like Sergey Lukyanenko and Alex Exler. " <br><br>  Among visitors to social Internet resources, the proportion of homosexual or bisexual users exceeds the proportion of heterosexual users.  Harris Interactive and Witeck-Combs Communications arrived at this conclusion as a result of a recent <a href="http://clickz.com/showPage.html%3Fpage%3D3624372">survey</a> .  About 27% of homosexual and bisexual users spend up to an hour per week on YouTube.com;  the corresponding proportion of heterosexual visitors is 22%.  To Craigslist.com, up to an hour is given to 20% of gays, lesbians and bisexuals and 13% of heterosexuals.  Users of homosexual and bisexual orientation also spend more time on sites that support social networks.  For example, 11% of the time spent on the web is gay, lesbian and bisexual, accounts for Friendster.com;  for heterosexuals, this figure is only 4%.  A similar trend is observed in relation to MySpace.com (33% and 28%). <br><br>  The audience of the Liveinternet.ru blogging service <a href="http://webplanet.ru/news/service/2007/01/09/lilj.html">turned out to be</a> much more active during the last New Year holidays than users of the so-called ‚ÄúCyrillic segment‚Äù Livejournal.com.  According to the statistics of the search on the blogs of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù, in the diaries of Li.ru from January 1 to January 8, 297 thousand entries were left, while the authors of the ‚ÄúLive Journal‚Äù unsubscribed only 258 thousand times, which is 38 thousand less.  At the same time, according to Yandex, the number of blogs on its LJ platform outpaces Li.ru by more than 100,000, but the activity of ‚Äúlive journalists‚Äù on holidays has sharply decreased.  If we consider the statistics for all holidays, including the 30th and 31st of December, which were also weekends, the gap between the number of entries on different platforms will be reduced to 33 thousand - users of LJ wrote 330 thousand posts against 363 thousand for live Internet users .  The giant domestic blogosphere company Mail.ru, which boasts the enormous popularity of its blog service, has added 115 thousand entries over the same period.  It is a pity that there is no similar statistics on the Belarusian services. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://net.compulenta.ru/301383/%3Fr1%3Dyandex%26r2%3Dnews">Kompyulenta</a> , Microsoft and AMD on the eve of the Christmas holidays sent a limited number of bloggers writing computer equipment reviews and samples for testing as part of a special event.  Some bloggers received a Ferrari line of Acer laptops, others received desktop PCs.  <a href="http://www.istartedsomething.com.nyud.net:8080/20061227/microsoft-free-ferrari">According to</a> Long Zeng, who runs his own blog and is also awaiting the New Year's ‚Äúgift‚Äù from Microsoft and AMD, companies leave bloggers with the option of leaving the device after testing themselves or sending them back to the manufacturer. <br><br>  Well, let's finish today's news digest with another optimistic report that they are going to plant another blogger.  <a href="http://www.jessicacutleronline.com/">Jessica Cutler</a> - this is a girl who first had sex with American politicians, and then described the impressions in a diary.  Of course, a book has already been written about it, a couple of lawsuits lie in the courts, and grateful fans exchange photos of the ‚Äúnew Monica Lewinsky‚Äù.  Maybe among our readers there are those who want to lead a sex column in the "KV"? <br><br>  <b>Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/186710.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/186710.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2007020601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 2, 2007)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288554/</a></p>
