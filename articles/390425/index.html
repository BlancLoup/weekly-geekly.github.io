Almost daily, exciting news comes from the world of robotics, and sometimes you are amazed at how quickly and successfully a person prepares a replacement for himself in various areas of contact with the surrounding reality.  Already, our mechanical assistants relieve us of many unnecessary problems, allowing us to forget about routine and labor-intensive operations, expanding the limits of our capabilities to new, inaccessible limits just yesterday. <br><br>  That new and interesting happened in this wonderful world a few days earlier we will tell in this article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/023/9a0/173/0239a01739995e605c0d4f78289a40b8.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Chinese robopovar will cook delicious ramen in 90 seconds</font> </h2><br>  The owners of the popular Chinese restaurant Toyako Ramen have concluded that they will be able to outrun the competitors and significantly increase the income of the establishment if branded <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD">ramen</a> (Jap. Men) for visitors instead of cooks who are experts in Eastern cuisine are prepared by robots.  90 seconds - just as many Koya and Kona robots spend on cooking ramen - a specialty Japanese dish with wheat noodles.  Of course, all the necessary ingredients and kitchen accessories at the same time must be available and located in their places.

      The development of a pair of robotic ‚Äúculinary masters‚Äù cost the owner Toyako Ramen 1 million yuan or 150 thousand dollars - the equivalent of the salary of two chefs paid for 6 years.  Despite the fact that the cost of a ramen bowl is 58 yuan, which is twice the cost of a similar portion of food in most restaurants in the city, the influx of visitors willing to try Koya and Kona cooking and appreciate their art has increased markedly. <br><br>  This is only the first step, a moment that reflects the emergence of a new trend.  In the near future, the robots involved in the catering industry will be assigned one of the key roles - the owner of the Toyako Ramen restaurant is sure, without denying the fact that the secrets of some oriental dishes passed from generation to generation were and will remain the property of a professional human chef and will be in demand while the Celestial is standing. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/UKSiUK45iQU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgjFAJNCWWgCfuQdl4DRRwm3cuRmQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Robokot changes the color of "wool" depending on the environment</font> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/498/558/6c4/4985586c4850207337b19f32f955aadc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A group of engineers from the Chinese University of Wuhan has developed a robot that can change its color depending on the color scheme of its environment.  Details of the work done are set out in the ACS Nano magazine.  Unique in its kind, the chameleon robot is made in the form of a cat, whose body elements are printed on a 3D printer.  Each of the elements of which the visible surface of the robot body is composed is equipped with an integrated sensor and a miniature plasmon ‚Äúdisplay‚Äù - a small glass plate with a recess with a diameter of 50 Nm.  The internal gilded surface of the recesses is coated with an electrolytic gel with silver ions. <br><br>  When each such ‚Äúpixel‚Äù interacts with the incident light, the thin upper layer of gold emits plasmons and becomes reddish.  When voltage is applied to the electrolytic gel, silver ions are in contact with gold, which is accompanied by a visual change in hue, and the change in the magnitude of the applied voltage allows the visible color to vary.  The absence or discharge of voltage to zero leads to leveling of the described effect.  The sensors used in the experiment to recognize the color gamut of the background and the magnitude of the voltage required for the supply responded to three basic colors (see video) ‚Äîblue, green, and red.  At the same time, the developed technology does not impose any restrictions on the creation of more complex structures with more advanced sensors that quickly and accurately respond to any changes in the background color gamut. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zT1AWwCBatQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhdPuesTS33oYtA_11kDq5vCi656A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Detailed results of the experiment are described on the pages of the online magazine ASC Nano.  A brief report is given in the edition of <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076384-robot-chameleon-changes-colour-to-blend-into-its-surroundings">newscientist.com</a> . <br><br>  Already in the short term, the engineers note, the developed technology of masking can be improved and will allow you to create instantly camouflage military camouflage or means that can hide any military equipment using the same principle. <br><br><h2>  <font color="¬´#6aa400¬ª">Why did you need to create a robot?</font> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b7/e7d/86d/3b7e7d86d48dc4d971df27fd998f6ee7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Researchers at the University of California at Berkeley have developed a robot belt, which has an amazing ability not only to carry multiple compressive loads, but also to move in such a state in tight spaces of confined space.  The development has been published in details in the <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/02/04/1514591113.full.pdf">PNAS</a> journal (via the link pdf-file) with a brief annotation <a href="http://news.berkeley.edu/2016/02/08/cockroach-inspires-robot-that-squeezes-through-cracks/">on the university website</a> . <br><br>  The researchers were inspired by the creation of a robotic cockroach, its living types from the family Periplaneta americana.  Having conducted many experiments on test benches specially created for this purpose, the scientists came to the conclusion that insects are able to withstand a load of 900 (!) Times their own weight.  At the same time, which is typical, cockroaches did not lose the ability to move quickly enough even when their body was squeezed 3-4 times in comparison with its natural state, and the ability to use the legs in accordance with their anatomical features was extremely difficult. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/81Zv8PPF8bE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhL80TrSB2TmPsZ8VScxEa2cBTY3w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As it turned out, effective movement in such a cramped state was possible thanks to the sensitive hairs on the legs, working in ‚Äúnormal mode‚Äù as a tactile organ.  In such conditions, excessive friction arises between the legs and the floor, while between the shell and the surface pressed from above is much smaller. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c1/6f8/026/2c16f80261ae487857de2bccce31f749.png" alt="image"><br>  <i><sub>CRAM and cockroach on the deformation stand</sub></i> <br><br>  By transferring the described principle to the construction of a robotic wire, the researchers were able to create a deformable CRAM robot.  The legs of a specific shape are fixed along the edges of the elastic shell.  When the exoskeleton is deformed, the legs rest against the bottom surface with another part of it, thus preserving the possibility of movement. <br><br>  CRAM robot is able to withstand a load of up to one kilogram, which is 20 times its own weight.  The robot keeps its movement ability almost doubled - from 75 to 35 millimeters.  According to the researchers, in the future, robots with similar capabilities will be in demand as ideal scouts in disaster areas, when they need to penetrate into the cracks, much smaller than the size of their corps. <br><br><hr><br>  Dear readers, we are always happy to meet and wait for you on the pages of our blog.
