This implies the case when the seals are on the side covers of the case, and there is no possibility to get inside. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Otmazhus advance  In no case do not claim the originality of the topic.  Let me just say that this piece of text was written personally and with the hope that it will help someone. <br><br>  The method is not difficult, but very much depends on the location and number of seals on (in) the case, and on the configuration of the case itself.

      First you need to make sure that you have the necessary connectors on the motherboard, as well as get acquainted with their location.  Manual in this should help. <br><br>  Dale need to carefully remove the front panel.  Usually it is mounted on plastic latches.  If the front panel could not be removed, you can remove the plugs on the front panel.  This can be done with a knife or other similar object, gently prying the cap.  After removing one of the plugs with the rest should not be a problem. <br><br>  Now, showing the extreme flexibility of your upper limb, you need to connect a SATA or IDE cable to the motherboard.  This is perhaps the most difficult part of the whole process.  If you can't do it yourself, you can ask a colleague or a friend with a thinner hand.  The best option if it is a girl.  Only depending on the level of her knowledge in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe PC device, it may be necessary to consult her, can be shown on the example of another motherboard, which is in a more accessible position. <br><br>  Further - easier.  We connect to the device a cable and power, which can also be obtained from the depths of the hull. <br>  If the device was a drive, then it is neatly inserted into the place put to it.  In the remaining empty compartments, you can optionally return the plugs.  If it was a hard drive, then you can gently put it on the bottom of the basket for devices of size 5.25, or come up with an alternative, such as a chassis for the hard drive. <br><br>  That's all. <br><br>  Thus, we connected the right device without losing the warranty. <br><br>  There is also known a method of obtaining access to the inside of the case by loosening the screws securing the power supply and pushing it inside.  But, in my opinion, this <s>perversion is an</s> extreme option.  Yes, and you need to be sure that the power supply is not glued with sealing stickers from the inside to the case, which is quite a common case. <br><br>  P.S.  Before starting the execution of this connection method, it is advisable to consider an alternative connection option for devices that do not involve penetration into the case (eSATA, USB, LAN).  You can also install an additional device in the company that sold you this system unit.  Sometimes they may ask for a fee.  I showed you one of the ways.  How to use - you decide. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88419/</a></p>
