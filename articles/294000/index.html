Let's see </h5><br>  Take a look.  Just look around you.  How many people around you are accustomed to act on the basis of the rules of logic, and not on the basis of emotional impulses? <br><br>  Open comments in most communities.  Is it often possible to observe how someone manages to convince his interlocutor about anything, using logic? <br><br><h6>  It is obvious that people tend to act on the basis of emotional state, but not on the basis of logic </h6><a name="habracut"></a><br>  People do not buy "goods" - they are interested in the feeling of happiness that arises in anticipation of the acquisition of this "product".

      The neurotransmitter dopamine (read "the hormone of happiness") is produced at the moment when a potential client mentally imagines the reward that he will receive if he performs an action in the form of a purchase. <br><br>  It works due to the fact that almost every person has a positive experience: ‚Äúgive money (action) = get what you want (reward)‚Äù <br><br>  Thus, not obtaining the desired product is the cause of happiness, and happiness due to the release of the hormone is the reason for the purchase. <br><br>  In addition, when a person feels happiness in anticipation of the purchase of your product, the connection ‚Äúyour product = happiness‚Äù is formed in his brain. <br><br>  Consequently, by provoking the production of dopamine, you can significantly increase the chances that a potential client will become your client, and not your competitor's client. <br><br>  As you can see, there is very little logic here, and a lot of emotions. <br><br>  It should be clarified that communication with the client is not just a correspondence by mail, or a conversation on the phone, Skype, at a meeting, etc. <br><br>  Communication begins at the moment when the customer begins to familiarize themselves with your products. <br><br>  It is proved that the best way to push a person to "fantasies" and the subsequent happiness from the anticipation of the purchase is a demonstration of what he will receive if he becomes your client. <br><br><h6>  As a demonstration you can use: </h6><br><br><ol><li>  Video presentation, promotional video </li><li>  Text </li><li>  Infographic in images </li></ol><br><br>  To understand what type of demonstration is the most effective, it is necessary to answer the question: <i>‚ÄúAnd which channels of information perception does the brain use?‚Äù</i> <br><habracut><br><ul><li>  Perception of information using text recognition </li></ul><br>  The text is great for drawing up contracts, agreements, protocols, etc., as it conveys only the essence, but does not convey emotions at all. <br><br><ul><li>  Speech recognition, words </li></ul><br>  Information "by ear" fit in the head a lot faster than using text reading.  Neither text nor infographics in images can transmit sound - this is only possible with the help of an audio track or video. <br><br><ul><li>  Recognition of tempo, timbre, intonation </li></ul><br>  The tempo of speech, the timbre of the voice and the intonation of pronunciation are the main way of understanding the speaker's emotions.  This is a complex ability of our brain that can be used to transfer the necessary "sensations".  Again, only with the help of audio and / or video is it possible to give a "liveliness" to your words. <br><br><ul><li>  Image perception </li></ul><br>  For example, many people have a well-dressed person riding an expensive car - an image of success.  Of course, people have their own, individual images, but since we all live in the same world, there are a number of images that almost coincide with most people. <br><br>  The text is not able to convey the image, but infographics and video are capable of this. <br><br>  Images very well convey emotions, convey the message, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyour product. <br><br><ul><li>  Recognition of facial expressions, gestures </li></ul><br>  Another reason why the text conveys bad emotions is the inability to demonstrate facial expressions and gestures.  Infographics in images is somehow capable of this, but a static image doesn‚Äôt compare with dynamically changing facial expressions in a video that is capable of creating a complex emotional construct. <br><br>  Mimicry and gestures, like intonation, tempo and timbre - this is a very subtle instrument in the ‚Äúhands‚Äù of the brain, allowing you to understand the emotions and intentions of other people. <br><br>  The more channels of perception you simultaneously touch on - the higher the chances that a person will feel happiness from the anticipation of purchase and, accordingly, the higher the chances that you will have a client. <br><br><h6>  Based on all the above information, we can draw certain conclusions, for this we summarize: </h6><br><br><ul><li>  The text is extremely inefficient transmits emotions, affecting only one channel of perception of information </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>  Infographics in the images is suitable for emotional contact with the client to a greater extent than the text, because it can affect three channels of perception at once: text recognition;  recognition of facial expressions and gestures;  perception of images </li></ul><br><br><ul><li>  Video presentations and advertising videos affect all channels of perception at the same time: a person sees the most ‚Äúshock‚Äù parts of the text;  hears the voice of the announcer, feels his intonation, tempo, voice timbre;  perceives facial expressions and gestures of characters in a video presentation, as well as perceives images. </li></ul><br><br>  From the above, I can once again draw a clear conclusion: your customers are not driven by logic, but by emotions, which you can evoke by influencing the maximum possible number of channels of information perception at the same time. <br><br>  Use this information and be sure - sales will grow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/750/1d5/385/7501d5385a1045d79be2950c8bcd5b76.jpg"></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294000/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294000/</a></p>
