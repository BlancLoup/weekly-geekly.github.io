Just walked past and caught sight of the design of the device.  This is exactly the style I like.  He seems to be considered "Asian" by professionals.  I certainly understand that my taste is old-fashioned, but I like and that's it.  And when I took the phone in my hands and started playing with it, for a long time I could not believe my eyes.  A real Android worked on this rather small little thing. <br><br>  I knew that this company does not manufacture its devices, but sells OEMs under its own brand.  I already had a rather pleasant experience using their simple phones.  They select the really high-quality models of different manufacturers, they are well prepared for sale and supported.  The model was completely new, the sellers did not know it very well, but it was difficult not to believe that there was a real Android inside, which, moreover, was working fairly well. <br><br>  I already stroked in the direction of Android, but here there is a chance to get experience in communicating with him, and on the communicator at the price of a smartphone (a little over 200 dollars).  Well, it's a sin to refuse.  And I did not refuse.  Therefore, this reviewer will be not only about the device, but also some impressions about Android in general.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="http://s3.sendpic.ru/i/91211/i/a4.jpeg" align="left">  Already at home, having climbed through the system settings, I found where my legs are growing.  This hardware base is listed under the name "Brava" and even released somewhere where under this brand.  I never got full information about what is there for iron and what are its characteristics, but I don‚Äôt really need it.  The system works quite lively and without any jams, which regularly haunted me on the rather powerful HTC Touch HD, and this is enough for me.  I don‚Äôt want to dwell on the boring technical characteristics, especially since nowadays even the ‚Äúyellow‚Äù equipment is on a good level according to these indicators.  Only a naked listing of what I found: <br><br>  - GSM 900/1800/1900 <br>  - GPRS / EDGE <br>  - Wi-Fi <br>  - BlueTooth (stereo) <br>  - Marvell 624 MHz <br>  - 256MB flash + 128MB DDRAM <br>  - WQVGA, LTPS, 260K, 3.0 ", 240x400 <br>  - Photo 3.2 mp <br>  - Video <br>  - FM radio <br>  - Micro SD up to 16 gig <br>  - Motion Sensor <br>  - Li-ion 1200 mAh, 220/7 h <br>  - 110 x 55 x 13.5 mm <br>  - 106 g <br><br>  The device, as I said, is quite small, almost the same size as my old love Sony Ericsson M600i, only slightly longer, but thinner.  Much smaller and lighter than Touch HD.  The front panel is made of solid glass with a dark gray mirror surface on the inside (except for the screen area).  Three buttons of the same color resemble <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582">hematite</a> .  The back cover of the battery compartment is also solid for the whole case.  It is made of plastic, but the painting imitates anodized brown aluminum.  The ends of the usual brown plastic.  It turns out in the case used three colors similar in tone and three textures of the material.  Perhaps this is not quite traditional, but I generally like it. <br><br> <a href="http://s3.sendpic.ru/big/91211/i/hJ.jpeg.html"><img src="http://s3.sendpic.ru/big/91211/t/hJ.jpeg" align="right"></a>  The camera in the phone has a rather average of 3.2 megapixels.  In general, I am interested in the cameras in the phone at the very least (if they are generally interested).  But for this review, I took test shots and it turned out that the camera is not the poorest. <br><br>  In one of the corners of the phone there was a mysterious stub.  Due to the fact that, at my request, my dear saleswoman, with her strong nails, tore out this plug with traces of glue from the display case, I did not have to do this with my own.  I confirm - a stub and nothing more.  Since the touchscreen in this model is capacitive and does not react in any way to extraneous stylus objects, I dare to suggest that this is the place for a telescopic antenna.  Probably the original case was developed for one of the kitsch models ‚Äú2 SIM cards + TV‚Äù. <br><br>  Android pleasantly pleased me with its functionality.  As I have already noticed, I was completely satisfied with the speed of work.  A huge plus that caught my eye is that the interface is completely under the finger and without a joystick.  In my latest Touch HD, in spite of all the ‚Äúfinger‚Äù twists on top of the usual Windows Mobile, glitches popped up here and there, when you can‚Äôt do anything without a joystick, or don‚Äôt get a finger.  Plus a known problem with the lack of a hardware keyboard in some programs.  In Android, everything is perfectly developed under the control of a finger without a joystick.  In addition, in the features of the device is listed "Full touch lens".  I have no idea what it is, but after working for a while, I begin to guess, this means that you can poke the screen with thick sausages, but it clearly identifies and focuses the center of touch.  Because of this effect, by the way, I had to relearn the way of working on the on-screen keyboard compared to the same Touch HD.  It was unusual and inconvenient at first, the dial speed dropped sharply, but by grabbing a different sensor essence, everything went much better. <br><br><img src="http://s3.sendpic.ru/i/91211/i/tI.jpeg" align="left">  I can not mention the onboard browser called "Browser".  Everything that Opera Mini has been proud of for so long is modestly surpassed here.  The most important feature is javascript, it works here with a bang.  I do not know how fully it is supported, but I had two sites that were necessary for work, with which I could not work from Opera Mini, but here they earned great money.  Opera, by the way, didn‚Äôt start at the first attempt, but I didn‚Äôt pick it up, because it‚Äôs not worth it. <br><br>  True decided to try Steel.  It started, but with a big "but."  In Android, the problem with the absence of a hardware keyboard is solved, so that when you press one of the buttons (medium, long), the on-screen keyboard appears on the screen.  And regardless of whether there are on the screen fields for text input or not: "You asked, you!".  (Of course, it automatically appears when focusing on the text field, but this is another way for every fireman.) So, in Style, I entered the address bar, but the keyboard did not appear.  I tried to call it on purpose, but it turned out that this click in Style was blocked (why?).  Everything else works, but you can‚Äôt dial the site address. <br><br>  What struck me unpleasantly (thank God not in the phone) - the official site of Android.  The collection of applications and the functionality of the site is so miserable that it is hard to believe that this is a Google product.  And for obvious requests, there is very little that is for Android.  Only indirectly, I somehow went to the site <a href="http://www.slideme.com/">www.SlideMe.com</a> , which found a more or less interesting collection of applications for Android.  True, this site was half non-functional (what kind of attack on Android?).  I did not immediately consider the microgd on 2 gig, which I was given as a gift with the device.  It turned out that she was stuffed with different applications, music, clips and wallpapers.  I had a solid collection under my nose that I never dreamed of the official Google site. <br><br><img src="http://s3.sendpic.ru/i/91211/i/S5.jpeg" align="right">  In general, the impression of my acquisition is more than positive.  Practically I am delighted.  I made this device my main one and it replaced me wonderful HD Touch.  It has a smaller screen, but because of the excellent font rendering, everything is remarkably readable and the loss is not felt.  In addition, it is not so small, at least more than the M600i, with which I have not parted for so long because of its Most Comfortable Keyboard in the World.  In fact, all the best of these two specimens were combined in it.  It is compact, lightweight, functional and modern.  He does not bulge elda out of his pocket, but at the same time I can solve on it remotely all the tasks that were assigned to more ‚Äúsolid‚Äù models.  So I want to congratulate myself on the acquisition. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77943/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77943/</a></p>
