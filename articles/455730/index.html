Himself created problems. <br><br>  I went abroad, with one bag, there was only a phone from the equipment) I thought I would buy a laptop on the spot, so as not to drag.  As a result, I bought my first, in my opinion, quite good MacBook Pro 8.2, 2011, i7-2635QM, DDR3 8GB, 256SSD.  Before that, there were ordinary laptops on the BIOS with Windows, on which the dog had already eaten, decided to switch to Apple, as I was very pleased with the phone.  It was installed High Sierra, I do not remember the version, but not the essence.  I decided that there was something left of the previous owner, passwords, etc.  I think I'll drop everything to zero <a name="habracut"></a>  , as on the phone, I assumed I would just go into the settings and choose to erase all the settings and content, but there was no such function ... Well, I‚Äôm Admin after all, the difficulties do not stop me, climbed into the Internet, and began to read how to reset the poppy.  Found some article, completely without reading, began to carry out the points: <br><br><ol><li>  Enter Recovery Mode (Command (‚åò) - R) </li><li>  Open Disk Utility </li><li>  Choose the railway and erase it ... </li></ol><br>  Then I got distracted when the laptop came back, it was already turned off, I started it, there was no apple, the OS was erased, I think it‚Äôs fine, now I‚Äôll continue the installation from Recovery mode.  I go into the Recovery mode, and it is not the same, it turns out, when I erased the hard drive, I erased the Recovery High Sierra area, and I downloaded the version for my Recovery Lion laptop from the Internet.  I think, okay, there will be a native system, it will not be stupid)) Already on the Internet I found how to install the OS, just in case, so that I don‚Äôt try again.  I click install OS X Lion, reach the authorization point, enter my AppleID and password, and then the problems started. First, I have two-factor authentication, the code comes to the phone, and the input window does not appear on the laptop, the password is not correct.  Here is the message:

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/im/sc/-i/imsc-ikilkiwja54yrqgwhdxiow.png"><br><br>  Looking again on the Internet, the problem is not new, and there is a solution, you need to get a code on your phone (https://support.apple.com/ru-ru/HT204974), I did it in ‚ÄúSettings ‚Üí [your name] ‚Üí Password and security ‚Üí Get the verification code. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qe/uz/ee/qeuzeeiqsaqzjnqzkwvftkqedrm.png"><br><br>  After receiving the verification code, you need to enter the AppleID credentials and password again on the laptop, but the password is already in a modified form.  For example, you have the password 12345678, and the verification code is 333-333, which means you need to enter the password in the password field as 12345678333333, without spaces or dashes.  So, I won this problem, and I‚Äôm already waiting for the new system to be installed, and then ‚ÄúWhat a surprise‚Äù, again the problem ‚ÄúThis item is temporarily unavailable.  Please try again later. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_v/po/ys/_vpoysygt0hb1dvuuturkxdmica.jpeg"><br><br>  Installation can not continue, I remind you only Mac and iPhone.  I am looking for how to fix this bug.  Only 4 options: <br><br><ol><li>  I tried to use AppleID with which I first entered this Macbook (I immediately rejected this option, did not want to pull the previous owner, as I was 90% sure that it would not work, or he was not the first owner, or even if there was zero access ... ) </li><li>  Change the date through the terminal (checked, the date is normal, I tried to change the sense of zero too) </li><li>  Via Safari in Recovery mode, log in to iCloud.com under your AppleID, and try again to continue the installation.  I tried, the Apple site says the browser is not supported </li><li>  Internet Recovery, the mode in which I am ... </li></ol><br>  That is, the options end there.  I'm already upset, I sit and see how to restore a MacBook, I find options only from under Windows with crutches to create USB from MacOS, and try to install.  This option did not suit me, firstly, I did not have where to get another computer, secondly, I was not satisfied with the version with the unofficial OS. <br><br>  I searched the Internet for several days how to put MacOS without having a second MacBook or a second PC at hand.  I read a lot of articles, found an article that was very close to me, but the guy had a second laptop, although I still partially used the installation principle (https://habr.com/ru/post/199164/).  I downloaded the system files from the official Apple site and found official links to the installer files on the Internet.  I entered the entire address bar manually. <br><br>  So, what exactly did I do (below I will describe the way how everything can be done completely without a flash drive, to this I have already guessed later when I figured out the system better): <br><br>  1. I went and bought a 32GB flash drive, and 16GB is also possible (it is needed for the installer). <br><br>  2. Boot into Internet Recovery mode (Command (‚åò) - Option (‚å•) - R). <br><br>  3. Run the ‚ÄúDisk Utility‚Äù and format our hard disk drive (I have the name of the hard disk Macintosh HD) and a USB flash drive with such parameters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_s/13/fh/_s13fhoucy_yj6fviwrqkykwzra.png"><br><br>  4. Then it would be possible to download an image from the terminal, but alas, Recovery mode of MacOS Lion does not support the elementary ‚Äúcurl‚Äù command for downloading files from the Internet, therefore I found another way out. <br><br>  Open Safari, in the top menu, go to "Safari ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Save downloaded to folder", and select our railway. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ul/gq/tm/ulgqtma3zjnhhumoloph-vijdoa.jpeg"><br><br>  5. Close the settings and enter the address in the address bar: <br><br>  <b><a href="">http://swcdn.apple.com/content/downloads/29/03/091-94326/45lbgwa82gbgt7zbgeqlaurw2t9zxl8ku7/BaseSystem.dmg</a></b> <br><br>  Press "Enter" and wait for the desired image to load. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qy/9y/n3/qy9yn3mqv-itqfluml4lafb0d-o.jpeg"><br><br>  6. Close Safari in the top menu ‚ÄúSafari ‚Üí Finish Safari‚Äù and open ‚ÄúUtilities ‚Üí Terminal‚Äù <br><br>  7. Next, mount the image "OS X Base System".  Enter the following command in the terminal: <br><br>  <b>hdiutil mount / Volumes / Macintosh \ HD / BaseSystem.dmg</b> <br><br>  (deviating slightly from the topic, a slash from left to right means a gap in the name, that is, you can enter this command like this: hdiutil mount ‚Äú/ Volumes / Macintosh HD / BaseSystem.dmg‚Äù) <br>  We are waiting until the image is mounted. <br><br>  8. Further, in the top menu ‚ÄúTerminal ‚Üí End terminal‚Äù <br><br>  9. Again, open the "Disk Utility" and restore the bootloader to our USB flash drive as in the screenshot (Note that when restoring, we select the source for the image itself, not the partition, and the destination is the flash drive partition): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zo/ut/za/zoutzajrb9mil4glogbyb7cwzyq.jpeg"><br><br>  10. Well, we have prepared a USB flash drive and can reboot the laptop with the Option key (‚å•) pressed, our USB flash drive will appear in the list, boot from it. <br><br>  11. We get into the Recovery mode, but now Mac OS High Sierra, and just select ‚ÄúInstall macOS‚Äù. <br><br>  Then everything is going fine, no problems should arise. <br><br>  <b>An option for those who do not have the opportunity to buy a flash drive.</b> <br><br>  The actions are identical, only we in the disk utility divide our railway into two sections, one makes 16 GB for the installer, it is advisable to add it to the end of the railway if there is such a choice.  Further actions are the same, download the image on the main partition, mount it, restore it no longer on the USB flash drive, but choose the partition we created on 16GB on the hard disk drive.  After rebooting with the Option key (‚å•) pressed, our recovery partition will appear in the list, boot from it, and install the OS on the primary partition. <br><br>  Have a nice day (or night).  I hope my article will be useful. <br><br>  PS: Screenshots were made after installation, because there are already more partitions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455730/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455730/</a></p>
