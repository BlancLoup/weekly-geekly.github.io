  <section class="page js-page"><h1>First Mobile Technology Day 2012 in Vinnitsa!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The popularity of gadgets and mobile platforms is growing in Ukraine with amazing speed.  Manufacturers increasingly delight us with new devices, and developers - incredible applications. <br><br>  To maintain the growing interest of developers in mobile technologies, the company EPAM organized <b>Mobile Technology Day 2012</b> - an event aimed at implementing unique ideas for mobile devices in the Hackathon format.  The task, as always, in 24 hours is to create a working mobile application for iOS / Android.  As it turned out, we were the first to spend Hackaton in Vinnitsa!  And therefore, such an event caused a pleasant surprise to many programmers. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  They decided to hold the event in Vinnitsa, from February 11 to February 12, at ul.  Cathedral, 24, in the conference hall "Panorama".  According to reviews, the room was chosen very comfortable, warm and cozy.

      On the street that day there was a strong frost - minus 18 in the afternoon and minus 22 at night.  Despite such harsh weather conditions, Hackaton did take place.  Almost all participants were from Vinnitsa.  Unfortunately, the registered Kharkiv did not arrive. <br><br>  The hackathon began with a welcoming speech from the head of the Vinnitsa branch.  Then the guys from the Vinnitsa office made presentations.  About 60 people gathered in the conference hall, some of them were present as guests. <br><br>  In addition to seamless coding, participants were able to attend a series of reports on topics related to mobile programming, in particular, IOS / Android platforms. <br>  Then we collectively discussed the topic of the Hakaton and chose the direction - SPORTS.  The guys shared on 5 teams.  And each team began to work on the project (it could be a toy or a program related to sports).  No alcohol, just healthy snacks.  Throughout the event, you could have a snack, drink hot tea, coffee or RedBull. <br><br>  At about 2 in the morning, some were drawn to sleep.  And we decided to sleep in the framework of Sport Hakaton and arrive at the conference hall by 8 am.  In the morning, having had breakfast, everyone went to work again.  The hall was very quiet, and only some of the participants periodically jumped or ran around the hall.  Subsequently, it turned out - the team developed a device that measures steps, jumps and at the same time gives out mileage and the number of calories burned. <br><br>  By 6 o'clock in the evening, the results were summed up and the prizes were awarded: <br>  For –Ü place - Tablet Tablet Apple iPad 2 Wi-Fi + 3G 16Gb <br>  For the second place - the phone Mobile phone SAMSUNG GT-N7000ZBA <br><br>  The winners of the Hackathon are: <br><br>  <b>1st place: Challenger Team</b> <br>  Reshetnik Alexander, Murzak Ivan <br>  The idea: the joint operation of multiple devices, the smart use of sensors. <br><br>  Project: Social Pong <br>  Android platform. <br>  The game is based on the game Pong.  Pong - computer game, ping-pong simulator. <br>  For the game you need two Android phones with an accelerometer and a gyroscope, and additionally one more phone (optional).  A tablet, laptop or TV is needed to demonstrate the game.  All devices must be on the same WiFi network. <br>  In the game you can play together, when each player controls his racket. <br>  The gameplay is controlled by the player‚Äôs movements.  The player needs to move (run or jump) with the phone left or right. <br>  The course of the game is broadcast on a third device. <br><br>  <b>2nd place: Epamzer</b> <br>  Igor Tyutyunnik, Andrey Morgunov <br>  Project: StepCounter <br>  IOS platform. <br><br>  In today's world, due to poor ecology, sedentary work, an uneven nutrition schedule and its quality, more and more people are paying attention to their health, keeping fit and weight control. <br>  To achieve the maximum efficiency of such studies, the StepCounter application is intended.  With the iPhone and the StepCounter app, you can train whenever you want!  And most importantly - to receive information about the results of training in the form of calories burned.  The application is a pedometer with the ability to count steps when walking and jumping (for example, on a rope).  The application has the ability to publish the results of training in social networks (Twitter, Facebook, etc.) <br><br>  <b>3rd place: 8</b> <br>  Evgeny Shemet, Vladimir Grechina <br>  Project: Hatesports game <br>  Platform: iOS iPad <br>  Game process: Playing on one device for two people.  One player throws items of sports equipment, the second breaks them.  For broken items, the second player gets points.  If he misses 3 items, players switch places.  The game is somewhat similar to Fruit Ninja. <br><br>  <b>4th place: R</b> <br>  Georgy Goryachev, Roman Gorenko, Alexander Vecherko, Vadim Zelinsky <br>  Project: Social Weight Manager - Lose Weight Together!  (LoseWeightTogether!) <br>  Platform: Android <br>  Essence: parameters (height, weight) are systematically entered into a given form, and thus a change in its weight is observed. <br>  The application has the ability to publish the results of training in social networks (Twitter, Facebook, etc.). On the Internet there are many different weight managers, but not a single application that would help to lose weight together! <br>  The application is available at <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dmast.avalons%26feature%3Dsearch_result">market.android.com/details?id=mast.avalons&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDEsIm1hc3QuYXZhbG9ucyJd</a> <br><br>  The guys perfectly coped with the task!  They embodied the idea in the application and managed to bring it to the people!  Well done! <br><br>  As a result, everyone unanimously decided as often as possible to get together and communicate more!  So see you soon! <br><br>  Photo report here: <a href="https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/105409122207643175834/albums/5711197088557731697">plus.google.com/u/0/photos/105409122207643175834/albums/5711197088557731697</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138801/</a></p>
