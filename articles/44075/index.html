  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Report from the past Startup Meeting in Novosibirsk</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The second meeting on startups was held on November 2 in Novosibirsk, a city with a real Siberian soul. <br><br>  <b>In November, two more meetings will be held in Yekaterinburg and Samara.</b>  Who wants, still have the opportunity to sign up. <br>  Details here - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Startpoint/42365/">http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Startpoint/42365/</a> <br><br>  At the same time, the meeting venue was lucky and unlucky ... ‚ÄúIl Patio‚Äù on Sunday evening gathered quite a lot of visitors who wanted to relax and talk with relatives more than listen to our frustration about startups.  The waiters, as they could, wriggled out of the situation, adding the volume of the music in the speakers, the benefit is that one of them hung right above us.  Then they began to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù merry grandmothers (who knows, he understood ...))) <br>  Nevertheless, we somehow managed to seat more than 30 people and get acquainted first.  At the meeting as such, the projects were not officially presented.  The people mostly communicated with each other in groups, at the same time asking me questions on any subject of interest to them.

      Now closer to the topic: guys, do not hesitate to openly discuss the projects that you are developing.  If your idea is a secret for us, then this is a secret for your users, remember. <br>  If you consider yourself a successful startup, share your experience with other people, you may find like-minded people among them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I was very surprised and pleased with the enthusiasm of the guys from Barnaul, who traveled about 300 km to meet.  Later we had a half-hour heated discussion of their ideas with them, they may well become interesting and profitable projects. <br><br>  A few more people were discussing with me complex technologies that carry enormous potential.  It was really felt that fire was burning in their eyes. <br><br>  It is a pity that Denis Boltikov was not at the meeting, whose blog I often read.  But, I think we will still have the opportunity to meet later. <br><br>  <b>The further format of the meetings</b> will still be more rigid, so that there are no ridiculous pauses.  Initially, if you have something to say, get ready so that there is no one-way communication.  If there is no project, think about the questions. <br>  Further, in order to get rid of the heap of people and loud music, I suggest holding meetings at an earlier time, around 11 o'clock in the afternoon.  Then, firstly, it will be easier to find us inside, secondly, no one will interfere with us, thirdly - they will bring food faster. <br><br>  Those who were at the meeting and did not have time, or were too ashamed to speak, write to me, I will insert your project into the report or answer questions. <br><br>  Gentlemen with cameras, lay out your phototapes :)) <br><br>  <b>Ps.</b>  By the way, what is your personal opinion - should we continue to hold meetings in public places, or should we organize everything in conference halls, more officially?  In our opinion, it is in a simple situation, even if noisy strong ties are made and people do not hesitate to talk openly. <br><br>  Your Mr.Twisterrrrr, waiting for comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44075/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44075/</a></p>
