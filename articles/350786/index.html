The announcement of tomorrow's Moscow <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crossover-moscow-hiring-tournament-software-engineering-manager-100kyear-tickets-43131919733">tournament</a> job seekers Software Engineering Manager suddenly became a " <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/crossover/blog/350610/">place for discussion</a> ." <br><br> <a href="http://xo-link.ru/tourney"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uz/0x/3-/uz0x3-uampkmghduxqzvmf-nrag.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  And the discussions are so keen that it became clear that it is impossible to leave the topic.  However, we will climb under the hood of the ‚Äúcrossover‚Äù job hierarchy, dismantle completed projects and the daily duties of employees.  But it is better to see once, <s>and even better to participate,</s> than hear a hundred times.  Therefore, we offer hablauser challenges: those of you who have seen or will see us - tell the truth about us on the pages of this blog without cuts. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At each of our tournaments, even without that, you can find a couple of users of Habr or Hiktimes.  Perhaps, someone from the habrakomuynity has already signed up for tomorrow's tournament?  If yes, please send Alsou to <a href="">alsou.ishkaeva@crossover.com a</a> link to your profile from the mail you registered (or register) for the tournament.  And leave a comment from this profile in the comments to this post.

      To everyone who does this, we publicly promise ‚Äúairtime‚Äù right on our corporate blog: you can post <i>any</i> feedback about <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/crossover-moscow-hiring-tournament-software-engineering-manager-100kyear-tickets-43131919733">tomorrow's Hiring Tournament</a> in our next post on Crossover offline events.  Only it is up to you to decide which text (which does not violate the rules of Habr and the laws of the Russian Federation) will be released under your blog in our blog - <u>regardless of the complementarity of the feedback for us</u> , regardless of the tournament results for you.  No one but a UFO can touch the comments - and will not be able to erase the records of your intentions and our promise. <br><br><h2>  However, the tournament </h2><br>  However, the tournament "Crossover" from this will not, suddenly, habrastrebele - we just do not understand our customers.  And we still, regardless of whether you are at Habr√©, invite only those who meet the requirements of the Software Engineering Manager job position: <br><br><ul><li>  Higher education in the field of IT. </li><li>  More than 5 years of experience managing multiple teams for various products and technologies. </li><li>  This is a management role of an international level for a person who already has experience in managing teams. </li><li>  The ability to focus on software development experience instead of product management. </li><li>  Proven experience in creating high performance teams and scalable best practices. </li><li>  5 years of experience in practical C ++, Java or .NET architecture development and programming. </li><li>  Relevant experience with DevOps and cloud architecture.  We literally live in the "cloud". </li><li>  Experience with high-performance corporate systems deployed in the infrastructures of large corporations. </li></ul><br><h2>  How many people will be employed? </h2><br>  The current demand for Software Engineering Manager is huge.  Of the 64 Crossover customers, nine have at least one open SEM position.  ‚ÄúNot less‚Äù is sometimes very much ‚Äúmore‚Äù - in the Aurea Software alone, there are now open 27 vacancies at Software Engineering Manager.  Like our other clients, these are international teams, on average only 10% Russian-speaking. <br><br><h2>  How long can the employment process take? </h2><br>  The tournament itself takes only four hours on your Saturday.  And since Monday, as the first results of the tournament are summed up, we will begin to lay out the best participants in the domestic marketplace for our customers. <br><br>  Then everything depends on the attractiveness of the applicant - some strong specialists received offers in a few hours.  The rest of the hiring process depends on both parties.  A successful tournament and an interview leads to a job offer with all the consequences.  A positive result of tomorrow's tournament will provide an opportunity to work on large international projects with a payment of $ 100 thousand per year (~ 474 000‚ÇΩ per month). <br><br>  Therefore, good luck in the tournament to our applicants.  And, of course, we hope that we can read and share your impartial views from the outside.  See you! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350786/</a></p>
