Comparison of alternatives</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The event of closing one of the most popular task managers for Android, was almost negligible for Habr.  In May, Yahoo bought this product, and literally last week sent some users emails ( <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2013/07/06/yahoo-finally-announces-astrids-fate-closing-down-august-5-2013/">text here</a> ) about its closure on August 5th. <br>  In this regard, many alternative services have prepared special tools for importing tasks from Astrid.  In this article I will review the most popular alternatives to this wonderful manager. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, what alternatives are offered in the letter itself: Wrike, Wunderlist, Sandglaz and Any.DO.  I will not consider products like Wrike and Sandglaz, as these are more project management managers, not task managers.  Plus, let's add GTasks, since this is also a popular task manager, and TickTick is a decent newbie in this field. <br>  Since I like it when the interface of the application matches the OS (I like the Holo themes), I will also describe a bit of impressions of it. <br><br><h4>  Any.DO </h4><br>  Ratings <b>:</b> 61512. <br>  <b>Rating:</b> 4.5. <br>  <b>Market Link:</b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.anydo">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anydo</a> <br>  <b>Website:</b> <a href="http://www.any.do/">http://www.any.do/</a> <br>  <b>Import from Astrid:</b> Install the application on your Android device, it will offer to do the import. <br><br>  An interesting application whose interface is made in white and blue with highly modified UI elements. <br>  Import problems arose immediately after installation.  Install from the market, open and register.  The application offers us to make import tasks from Astrid.  We agree and after a while we look at the result.  The application separates the tasks in blocks with their dates and I have 15 tasks in the ‚ÄúToday‚Äù block, although only 2 tasks were assigned to Astrid today.  All other tasks were also scattered according to incomprehensible logic.  I also failed to remove the due date.  It seems that they have such a principle. <br>  In the application, I never found how to delete tasks.  You can only execute, and then delete everything done in a crowd. <br>  By cons added the lack of a web interface, although the site indicates that it will be soon.  So far, you have to be content with an extension for Google Chrome. <br>  So, what can the Android version: <br><ul><li>  Mark a task as important. </li><li>  Search for a task by name in Google. </li><li>  Set the date, time, repetition.  After this date can not be removed. </li><li>  Attach a note. </li><li>  Share. </li></ul><br>  Import works or not correctly, or they have their own atmosphere there.  Personally, I did not like the result.  By the number of features, it clearly does not reach the level of Astrid.  I didn't like the interface for many reasons: <br><ul><li>  Editing the name in a modal window. </li><li>  Some kind of creepy background when you click on the settings button in the Action Bar. </li><li>  Many artifacts due to the Russian interface.  It is better to switch to English. </li><li>  Task actions icons look blurry on my Google Nexus 4. </li></ul><br>  In general, the <b>verdict</b> : either the developers went their own way, or the application is still very far from the level of Astrid.

    <h4>  Wunderlist </h4><br>  Ratings <b>:</b> 21,834. <br>  <b>Rating:</b> 4.4. <br>  <b>Market Link:</b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.wunderkinder.wunderlistandroid">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wunderkinder.wunderlistandroid</a> <br>  <b>Website:</b> <a href="https://www.wunderlist.com/">https://www.wunderlist.com/</a> <br>  <b>Import from Astrid:</b> <a href="http://astrid.wunderlist.com/">http://astrid.wunderlist.com/</a> <br><br>  The application is also very popular on the market and has its own design inspired, as I understand it, by iOS (rounded edges, bulging dies of tasks).  Android and Web applications are made in a similar style. <br>  Here, too, the import was not without surprises.  After the import procedure, going into the web client you can see one of two pictures: <br><ul><li>  Empty list.  Yes, completely empty without a single task, although a notification was sent to the email that the import had already passed.  To fix this glitch - you need to create a new task.  After this, the imported tasks begin to appear magically. </li><li>  The list has 2 times more tasks.  Tasks are duplicated after import and this is a <a href="http://support.wunderlist.com/customer/portal/questions/1066024-astrid-import-problems">known bug</a> . </li></ul><br>  Well, we delete duplicate tasks with pens.  Parallel feeling how the web interface lags.  The first time I installed the mobile app, I saw the entire list with duplicates, although in the web client I deleted half of the tasks after the import.  Now it seems already corrected.  The interface on Android is also a bit crammed. <br><br>  Synchronization takes place at regular intervals.  There is no push, as in Astrid you will not see here. The application weighs 14 MB, which is 2 times more than Any.DO. <br>  What can Android version: <br><ul><li>  Mark the task. </li><li>  Set date, repeat and reminder by time. </li><li>  Add subtasks to the task.  The quantity is limited in the free version. </li><li>  Add a description. </li><li>  Share. </li></ul><br>  <b>Verdict</b> : better than Any.DO, but worse than Astrid. <br><br><h4>  GTasks </h4><br>  <b>Ratings:</b> 28,928. <br>  <b>Rating:</b> 4.5. <br>  <b>Market Link:</b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dorg.dayup.gtask">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dayup.gtask</a> <br>  <b>Import from Astrid:</b> After launch, the application itself will offer to make an import. <br><br>  I used this application before Astrid.  Since I love Google products, I wanted to find an app for Google Tasks for Android.  I tried them a lot and stopped there.  The design of the application is made using standard UI components, which I really like.  Everything looks beautiful and tasteful. <br>  Import went through with minor problems.  The dates were set normally, but for tasks where there were no reminders by time, they appeared at 12 noon. <br>  What can the application: <br><ul><li>  Set date, time, repeat. </li><li>  Mark a task as important. </li><li>  Share. </li><li>  The description and title of the task are one entity. </li></ul><br>  There are significantly more settings in the application than in Any.DO and Wunderlist. <br>  Well, now the fly in the ointment ... The interface of Google Tasks web client, which can be seen in Gmail, is a little more than wretched.  It is impossible to adjust the reminder time there, mark tasks as important too.  In general, many of you have seen it with your own eyes. <br>  Fortunately, he is able to synchronize with the next product, which has a web interface. <br>  <b>Verdict</b> : it‚Äôs not convenient to use without a normal web client. <br><br><h4>  Ticktick </h4><br>  <b>Rating:</b> 73. <br>  <b>Rating:</b> 4.5. <br>  <b>Market Link:</b> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ticktick.task">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ticktick.task</a> <br>  <b>Import from Astrid:</b> <a href="https://ticktick.com/about/astrid/welcome">https://ticktick.com/about/astrid/welcome</a> or from the settings of the mobile application. <br><br>  I could not resist :).  Found this application while describing the article.  This application is created by the developer GTasks.  Apparently, he decided it was time to stop being dependent on Google and build up his backend.  The application is similar in style to GTasks, but there are a lot of differences: <br><ul><li>  A left panel has been added, on which lists are located. </li><li>  The settings are much smaller.  They are almost the bare minimum. </li></ul><br>  What it will please us: <br><ul><li>  Set date, time, task repetition. </li><li>  Setting importance. </li><li>  Description to the task is added in the same way as in GTasks. </li><li>  The task can be shared. </li></ul><br>  The web interface of the application is.  He is in the Beta state and looks fairly flat and simple, which personally pleases me.  Synchronization in the mobile client begins immediately after creating the task.  In general, semi-automated, no queues as in the Wunderlist. <br>  <b>Verdict</b> : mobile application is rather weak, but in conjunction with GTasks is a good thing. <br><br>  We summarize all the data for comparison in the table. <br><table><tbody><tr><th width="150">  Opportunity </th><th>  Any.DO </th><th>  Wunderlist </th><th>  GTasks </th><th>  Ticktick </th></tr><tr><td>  Web interface </td><td>  Is missing.  There is an extension for Chrome </td><td>  there is </td><td>  Simple in Gmail or TickTick </td><td>  There is.

If you need more features, then Wunderlist will be a good choice. <br>  Naturally, I did not consider all the task managers, but only those that I liked and are more suitable for switching from Astrid. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I can not place a post in the GTD hub due to lack of karma. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186558/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186558/</a></p>
