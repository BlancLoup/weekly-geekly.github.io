Of course, many will take our news with irony and inevitable smirks. <br><br>  Alas, the development of K-Meleon has stagnated for a number of objective reasons, the main of which is dependence on a single developer.  Our "father-developer" Dorian had several problems in a row, which had the most negative impact on the development, coupled with the turbulent revolutions in the Mozilla engine code, about which the community had long ago turned back and now continues to howl quietly.

      Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the development got up completely - our build is based on the code released in December 2016.  True, this is still the release candidate of the 76th version, based on the Gecko 38 ESR, so the browser deliberately moved into the category of oldfag tools, relevant for owners of outdated and weak equipment. <br><br>  No, it still works great on modern equipment, but modern web design with a swift jack brings down more and more new features of popular sites (often written against all web standards), which browser developers just GOING to support.  For where they (even such as Google) butt with the same facebook is more expensive.  Please insert a crutch into the code. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the 76th version of our browser is quite a working horse, overpowering the vast majority of sites.  And in some places already we substitute our crutches. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But enough of the preludes: we are introducing a new Russian Pro assembly, and I will tell you about its main features.  As before, our assemblies are aimed at making K-Meleon the most friendly, functional and convenient product. <br><br>  Traditionally, they contain a lot of dopfunktsional, which makes life easier for users. <br>  But above all, we supported the tradition of supplying each new large version of our assemblies with a new face face.  This time it is a specially modified Pinstripe skin that looks something like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d9/73d/686/2d973d6868d34cbdae3aaaef3f7dda23.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Here we immediately see the very new theme of the design, and the new start page, and a few buttons hinting at some additional functionality of the assembly. <br><br>  Let's go to him and move on. <br><br>  1) To accommodate additional functions, we created a new menu item ‚ÄúPro‚Äù, where the commands responsible for new functions will be placed.  Something similar (and very sophisticated) was in different assemblies of the old Opera (for example, Opera LE).  Everything is modest for now, but this menu will continue to grow.  Also, the items of this menu can be duplicated in the context menus that are relevant for a particular feature. <br><br>  2) We moved some features already in the previous Pro build to this menu - for example, opening a link in a new application (it used to be called ‚ÄúOpen in another browser‚Äù, but since it can transfer the link to any program, able to receive links directly, we renamed it).  In addition to browsers, it is very convenient to add, for example, media players for playing audio and video files. <br><br>  Even from the old in this menu now live settings IE-tabs and the choice of the download manager (good old oGet). <br><br>  Also here is the quick access to about: -pages. <br><br>  3) Now the actual new chips.  First, it is a tool to bypass <b>UltraSurf locks</b> .  Done through the integration of a third-party application of the same name. <br>  Turns on the button, it also turns off.  Also, <b>UltraSurf</b> will be automatically closed when exiting K-Meleon. <br><br>  It does not require any (!) Additional gestures and settings, it works in the background, without looking at the eyes, but just in case it is provided with a certificate displayed on the first launch of the machine, and then on demand (via the menu or via hotkey). <br><br>  4) <b>HTML5 media switch</b> .  This extension quickly deactivates the html5 media player, allowing those who wish (we know that they are there) to forcefully switch to a flash player.  Oldfazhit so oldfazhit! <br><br>  5) There are also commands for <b>quickly translating pages</b> using Google and Yandex.  This functionality is also duplicated in the context menu of the page, links and frame. <br><br>  6) Video saver is a means of integrating video saving services hosted on various sites - from classic YouTube to RuTube and Twitter (because on the very twitter, the video is played only in the most mainstream browsers - such is garbage). <br><br>  In general, the 76th branch, although formally a release candidate, has long been used in the community.  And since the Pro-assembly is noticeable - by the standards of a niche little-known product - popular (the latest version 75.10 Pro has been downloaded more than 30,000 times), now Russian-speaking (and not only) we are ready for the English Pro-assembly) users have a great reason to upgrade.  The main thing is that in the 76th version there is no insidious bug leaked into the previous version, which crashes the browser on Cyrillic domains. <br><br>  Now, no left-downs on the website of President. Rf!  ;) <br><br>  In the following publications (again, if we are extended) we will tell you more about the situation around the browser and its development, about the prospects, problems and our plans, which would have been a good thing. <br><br>  Because several tens of thousands of people are precisely interested in the fact that this browser lived. <br><br>  It is worth noting that for such an unevenly developing product, we still have very good development dynamics: yes, as far as K-Meleon‚Äôs fame leaves much to be desired, we have already been noticed by the developers of some OSes, and the coders of individual problem sites, and even authors of some extensions for Firefox.  Of course, this dynamic must be preserved and strengthened so that we can talk about a serious product, but our thoughts are devoted to this. <br><br>  And the news of the year was certainly the fact that Yandex noticed us - and in this build we are conducting an experiment with the search engine to integrate their search into our browser. <br><br>  While this cooperation is purely research in nature.  There is no monetization in this, and whether it is possible - just the life cycle of our new build, K-Meleon 76 Pro, will show. <br>  So far, it is published (as well as its official base) in the status of a release candidate.  In the course of running around it will be made the necessary corrections and additions. <br><br>  <a href="">Download assembly 76 Pro RC</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326618/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326618/</a></p>
