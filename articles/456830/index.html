About the eyes is not a joke: now, when these lines are published on the Internet, in our American office it is three in the morning, chipmunks and squirrels outside see walnut dreams, and our company's employees, traditionally gathered in June to work together in the Americas, launch an auto-update system , change the version numbers on the servers and are engaged in other release routine.  And, well, still the raccoons in the backyard of the office are not sleeping - they are gently rattling the lids of trash cans in search of something tasty and, sighing sadly, they are sent to neighboring yards.  Our smaller brothers do not understand that the most delicious thing today is a fresh stable version of the Vivaldi 2.6 browser.  That is about him now.

      So, in the new release we are waiting for: <br><br><ul><li>  Built-in ad blocker </li><li>  Personalization of user profiles </li><li>  Password filtering </li><li>  Display of unread pages in the sidebar </li><li>  Search engine icon in the search box </li><li>  Advanced search capabilities on the page </li><li>  Razer Chroma headset and headset support </li><li>  Improved performance when working with tabs and sidebars </li></ul><br>  Next, we dwell on these updates. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Built-in ad blocker </h3><br>  This option appeared in the browser due to changes in the Chromium code, dictated by the new policy of the well-known company in relation to the blocking of advertising.  We also decided to add such a function, but at the same time, we are not refusing to support the already familiar and well-proven blocking extensions.  Read more about our opinion <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/vivaldi/blog/454936/">here</a> .  The option is enabled by default, you can disable it in the browser settings in the "Privacy" section: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/291/0f5/1a6/2910f51a667c178dbc6578641c5c2846.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Personalization of user profiles </h3><br>  Profiles appeared in the previous version of the browser Vivaldi, and today we present the advanced features of the use of this function.  As you know, by default, the main profile icon was faceless, and when synchronization was turned on, the user's photo from the profile on vivaldi.net was loaded in its place.  Now for other profiles you can choose funny icons that will allow you to easily find the desired profile: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e1/470/16d/1e147016d1ad183c12a382e345744391.png" alt="image"><br><br>  We also added a small dialog to switch between profiles: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/722/446/931/7224469315fee34d53186923d6ed919e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, it would seem, little things, but they can significantly simplify the work with this useful feature. <br><br><h3>  Password filtering </h3><br>  Another little thing that will simplify the hard life of the Internet user.  As a rule, during our online life we ‚Äã‚Äãhave to register on many different websites and online services.  Logins and passwords for them are stored in the browser, but finding the right one among hundreds of entries is not the easiest task.  Therefore, we added the ability to filter passwords, allowing users to literally get the required data in a couple of clicks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/952/f7f/885/952f7f885bb858c4e375292524061aab.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A small hint: you can search by addresses and logins.  Very fast and convenient. <br><br><h3>  Display of unread pages in the sidebar </h3><br>  Working with a lot of tabs is sometimes quite difficult to understand which tabs you‚Äôve already looked at, and which others are still waiting for your careful study, and how many of them are open at all, these mysterious islands of wisdom, which haven‚Äôt been penetrated by a single well-known person.  We decided to simplify your life and added an indicator of open, but still unread pages to the Window sidebar icon: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/443/080/aae/443080aae831423d19477e6f501d52d7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At the same time, the headings of these tabs you have not yet visited will be displayed in italics so that you can easily distinguish them from all the others. <br><br><h3>  Search engine icon in the search box </h3><br>  This function is quite logical, but, by the will of evil rock or other force majeure, has not yet been implemented.  We are correcting this mistake and are pleased to announce that now the search field will display not a boring magnifying glass, but a bright life-affirming icon of the currently active search resource: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/560/fcd/64d/560fcd64df985ed9dfb8156620486f96.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I suppose that now many will start experimenting with the search field in their browser and will be perplexed - here it is, a magnifying glass, and where is the icon?  That's right, she's not there.  And it will not be as long as you do not enable the corresponding option in the settings: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/526/cc4/242/526cc4242784a9019a049ab8374a8945.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Advanced search capabilities on the page </h3><br>  And here is the novelty for real gourmets of keyboard management.  We all know the good old search function on the page, called by the keys Ctrl + F.  Of course, it can also be invoked through the standard menu, but in a decent society it is not customary to talk about it - everyone knows that only the keyboard belongs to the tools of a real computer guru, and the mouse is the devilish invention of the secret society of enikeyschikov.  In general, we opened the search on the page in one way or another, and then used it for its intended purpose - we entered the search word or phrase, having received the highlighted search results on the page.  And now the most important thing: if there is a link among the search results, then by going to it using the F3 key approved by the Ministry of Health, this link can be opened instantly using the key combination Ctrl + Enter.  After this kind of magic, any adept of the murmurous fuss will simply be speechless. <br><br><h3>  Razer Chroma headset and headset support </h3><br>  Since the support of the Razer Chroma devices, differing from their counterparts in the bright, mimicking content under the browsed content, appeared in Vivaldi, the forums began heated discussions about whether this feature is useful or not.  And no one noticed the sad eyes of the owners of sound headsets and headphones of the same Razer Chroma: they are supposed to be happy, but at the same time they are happy, and there is nothing - their devices are not included in the list of supported ones.  But now it's all in the past - this version of Vivaldi allows these users to enjoy the whole range of colors of the network through the browser's numerous luminous headphones. <br><br><h3>  Improved performance when working with tabs and sidebars </h3><br>  And now we come to the most difficult issue.  But you need to start from afar.  Even at the very beginning of the life of the Vivaldi browser, it, due to its design features, was not distinguished by the high speed of the interface.  Many years have passed, and the Vivaldi browser, by virtue of its design features, is still not distinguished by the high speed of the interface.  But there is one subtlety: the current low speed of the interface of the Vivaldi browser is significantly higher than the low speed of the interface of the browser of Vivaldi four years ago.  Here is such a tricky objective reality.  And in general, the low speed of the interface of the Vivaldi browser with each version is getting higher and higher. <br><br>  So in today's version, we have spent some efforts to overcome the increasing slowing down of the interface in the process of opening, closing, resizing and other manipulations made with tabs and side panels.  The difficulty is that the effect is manifested only in the case of working with a variety of tabs and side panels, but users who prefer to work in moderate mode will not notice this joy - their browser will still work quickly and comfortably.  Not to mention the users, the number of open tabs that do not exceed three or four - they do not understand at all what speed it is.  In general, we hope that our improvements will make some users a little more calm and happy. <br><br>  On this, perhaps, you can finish.  It remains to recall that in addition to the changes listed above, we actually made a lot more - you can find the full list of changes <a href="https://update.vivaldi.com/update/1.0/relnotes/2.6.1566.40.html">here</a> .  In this list you will see a lot of corrected errors, among which, perhaps, you will see the one that prevented you from working quietly and ruining your nerves. <br><br>  By the way, here is another interesting picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c01/cb7/e9f/c01cb7e9f7bfca236cb3e9e1a556a462.png" alt="image"><br><br>  You can see the mention of this new feature (‚ÄúMenu by double-clicking‚Äù) in the list of changes, but you will not find it in the settings.  Although it is.  In general, as a gopher, only better.  <b>To the first person to tell us how to make this option available for work, we will send a gift.</b> <br><br>  A new version of the browser can be downloaded from the <a href="https://vivaldi.com/download/" rel="noopener noreferrer">official site</a> . <br><br>  We are waiting for new wishes and suggestions from you, and do not forget to inform us about all the errors and shortcomings at the <a href="https://vivaldi.com/bugreport/" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous address</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/456830/">https://habr.com/ru/post/456830/</a></p>
