Image Credit: NASA] <br><br>  However, more recently, similar reflections have begun to be noticed where there are no lakes.  Moreover, they are impermanent.  Today sparkles, in the next span with a very similar geometry - no longer.  What's the matter? <br><br>  To explain the hypothesis of "wet asphalt".  Imagine that a methane rain has passed over a slightly rough terrain.  "Asphalt" is wet and shiny.  To the next Cassini passage above the terrain, it dried out and no reflections were observed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a9/807/391/3a980739116c4172abd4c9abdc0b5eeb.jpg" alt="image" width="400"><br>  --- === --- <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/1686.pdf">METHANE, ETHANE AND NITROGEN LIQUID STABILITY ON TITAN</a></b> <br><br>  Continue about the hydrosphere of Titan.  Developed with seas and rivers.  True, the prefix "hydro" is not quite appropriate here, because there is no water in those seas, but they are filled with liquid methane (CH <sub>4</sub> ), ethane (C <sub>2</sub> H <sub>6</sub> ) and nitrogen (N <sub>2</sub> ).  It is not very clear only in what proportions and how these substances generally interact in the conditions of Titan.  What and work.  Quite a lab. <br><br>  The authors took these three gases, cooled them to cryogenic temperatures, and began to watch how they mix and when they freeze, depending on concentrations and pressures.  And they found things in the light of which Titan's hydrosphere looks like a much more complex system compared to the Earth‚Äôs oceans.  However, if you have three ‚Äúwaters‚Äù and three different ice instead of one, then something like this should have been expected. <br><br>  Methane-ethane mixture freezes with a more severe frost than each of the gases separately.  That is, these gases work as mutual antifreeze. <br><br>  When this mixture freezes, the methane ice floats to the surface, while the ethane sinking and sinks to the bottom.  Which is formed first - depends on the initial concentration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c8c/01d/c0a/c8c01dc0a07745889aa68b81382895ec.jpg" alt="image" width="400"><br>  [Photo of an experimental camera from work.

Trilling, S. Tegler / Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, AZ;  Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ;  University of Texas, Austin, TX.] <br><br>  Further, the ingress of nitrogen into the mixture (just from the atmosphere) can raise the melting point of the mixture, and, accordingly, lead to its unexpected freezing.  By the way, in <a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/1932.pdf">another work</a> it is shown that nitrogen is well dissolved in methane - but it is bad in ethane.  Thus, the evaporation of a part of methane from a liquid can cause a sudden ‚Äúboiling up‚Äù of the sea.  Some kind of cryogenic champagne with nitrogen bubbles. <br><br>  Finally, the most interesting.  At pressures of more than 2.5 atmospheres (corresponding to depths of more than ~ 100 meters on Titanium), the methane-ethano-nitrogen mixture is divided into two liquid phases.  The report was a terrific video, but here you‚Äôll have to limit it to a not very good picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ff/0e8/1bd/8ff0e81bd632419cac4bcefb6a22fc37.jpg" alt="image" width="400"><br>  [Image Credit: J.

Tegler / Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, AZ;  Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff, AZ;  University of Texas, Austin, TX.] <br><br>  Top - gas.  Below it is the first liquid phase, rich in ethane.  Under it - the second, rich in nitrogen.  And on the "ceiling" of the first phase there is a tiny hint of a drop.  This is the second phase condensate.  Which is the real drops, like oil in water, flows through the first light into the second. <br><br>  Imagine a double-layered sea?  So do I. <br><br>  After the report, I thought about this.  The terrestrial oil industry has long been engaged in cryogenic separation of associated gases.  Of which the very first - just methane with ethane.  Well, nitrogen and the atmosphere is full.  So, perhaps, people are already familiar with all these interesting effects in oil refining.  It is difficult not to pay attention to the suddenly frozen (from nitrogen) pipeline.  But if this is so, then surely all these studies are deeply closed corporate secrets ... <br>  --- === --- <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/2406.pdf">CLASSIFICATION OF LABYRINTH TERRAINS ON TITAN</a></b> <br><br>  The labyrinths of Titan are plateaus, cut by a complex system of valleys and ridges, visually resembling the bark of a tree: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/884/fbb/9ca/884fbb9caa0e425cad0e2b836c5d8265.jpg" alt="image" width="400"><br>  [Image Credit: NASA / JPL] <br><br>  Their nature is not quite clear.

They do not flow from anywhere and nowhere. <br><br>  So at least part of the labyrinths are not a river bed?  The authors took up morphological analysis and concluded that some of these formations are supposedly ... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karst">karst</a> !

Mysterious pits ("hollows") on it, too, have not been properly explained yet.  But one hypothesis says that these are ... karst too.  Formed by the evaporation of some volatile substance under a layer of dust and regolith. <br><br>  So they look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/891/70a/087/89170a0871924ae4a7fa12d3b3afeb4a.jpg" alt="image" width="320"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b20/1a8/bb1/b201a8bb129f455cb95b30df52cdcafb.jpg" alt="image" width="320"><br>  [Pits on Mercury.

Good, beautiful photos of "pits", collected by the authors for the purpose of their classification and submitted to the public.  The numbers I wrote down.  And may the authors forgive me, one laid out, slightly with the photo shop to raise the contrast.

To estimate the mineral composition, all metal elements are usually assumed to be fully oxidized.  That is, silicon, for example, is present as SiO <sub>2</sub> , aluminum as Al <sub>2</sub> O <sub>3,</sub> and the like.  From the resulting oxides, then, as a constructor, minerals make up (for example, calcium silicate Ca <sub>2</sub> SiO <sub>4</sub> is 2 * CaO + SiO <sub>2</sub> ). <br><br>  Everything is good, but for Mercury this is not working.  The balance of oxygen does not converge.  It is not enough to oxidize everything that is oxidized, retaining the measured ratio of oxygen to silicon O / Si = 1.4 ¬± 0.03 (and even less, as stated in the work). <br><br>  In an attempt to explain this inconsistency, a hypothesis was advanced: in the depths of Mercury, a kind of ‚Äúmetallurgical smelting‚Äù of pure silicon from quartz and graphite occurs, which, as we strongly suspect, makes up a few percent of the planet's crust. <br><br>  If this is true, then 12.6‚Äì17.9% (by weight) of the surface of the northern hemisphere of Mercury should be formed of metallic silicon or its alloy with iron. <br><br>  What is interesting?  Well, firstly, non-oxidized silicon as a rock-forming substance is unusual.  Secondly, on all other stony bodies (Moon, Earth, Mars) oxygen is in excess and everything that can in principle be oxidized by it, oxidized for a long time.  Why is it suddenly not so well-done by the sun of Mercury?  Riddle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7de/594/28d/7de59428dc5c476ab5bdb97245c01d29.jpg" alt="image" width="320"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5e/e03/bfa/c5ee03bfa56e40eb80a46a5474cd6a19.jpg" alt="image" width="320"><br>  [Mercury and silicon.

But, as it turned out, he was not aware of the existence of ‚Äú <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_swirls">lunar swirls</a> ‚Äù.  Moreover, I can not even imagine what is the official name of this phenomenon in Russian.  On the Internet, there are "eddies", "twists", "curls", "albedo anomalies" and "diffuse structures".  The latter, though less often, but in more serious sources, so I will use this term. <br><br>  Discovered in the 1960s, these structures still represent a mystery.  Outwardly, they look like bright stripes and spots, with a kind of periodic pattern: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a4/984/166/8a498416606f400bbb718153eca72493.jpg" alt="image" width="320"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db7/e73/03c/db7e7303ca8d4476a010ce1b5d56e456.jpg" alt="image" width="320"><br>  [Lunar diffuse structures.  Left Image Credit: Wikipedia;  Right Image Credit: NASA] <br><br>  This pattern vividly reminded me of the pictures that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D1coFI5OLSwY">appear on the electron-beam TV</a> when the magnet is presented, if anyone remembers such a phenomenon.  This similarity is reflected in one of the hypotheses explaining the diffusion structures.  It is believed that under them in the lunar soil are natural permanent magnets.  Say, a magnetized lava tube or the remains of an iron meteorite.  With their magnetic field, they deflect energetic charged particles of the solar wind, not allowing them to bombard the surface - and therefore it remains bright.  A kind of invisible protective dome over the terrain.  By the way, these structures are really associated with magnetic anomalies. <br><br>  The work itself is about estimating the parameters of a buried magnet, but I already had enough surprise. <br>  --- === --- <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/2332.pdf">HOW DIELECTRIC BREAKDOWN MAY WEATHER THE LUNAR REGOLITH</a></b> <br><br>  Not only meteorites plow the lunar surface.  It turns out that the solar wind, especially on a moonlit night, makes a comparable contribution.  How?  The flow of energetic electrons.  Which can fly into the night side of the Moon and charge regolith particles there to tensions of ~ 10 <sup>6</sup> V / m.  What leads to explosive electrical breakdown.  The material in the breakdown channel evaporates, adding gas to the rarefied lunar atmosphere, and the speck of dust is destroyed or melted.  Soil, as a result, slowly mixed.  This works the better, the darker and colder the terrain (in warmth, the charge ‚Äúflows down‚Äù with normal conductivity). <br><br>  So, who knows, maybe the traces of astronauts will not be erased by dust from a meteorite fallen near, but by gradual evaporation from trillions of microscopic electrical breakdowns? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c98/ed7/0cd/c98ed70cd26748939359905aa85c8535.jpg" alt="image" width="400"><br>  [Also electric discharge, but larger] <br>  --- === --- <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/1031.pdf">SPACECRAFT IMPACTS ON THE MOON: CHANG'E 1, APOLLO LM ASCENT STAGES</a></b> <br>  <b><a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/eposter/1031.pdf">Electronic poster</a></b> <br><br>  Cosmonautics already has its own archeology.  Considering the modern orbital images of the planets, people find vehicles there that had reached these celestial bodies decades earlier (see, for example, the magnificent story about <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/175827/">Mars-3</a> ). <br><br>  The author of this work specializes in the traces of falling lunar vehicles, collecting a whole collection of them.  This year, four more were added to them: from the take-off steps of Apollo 12 and -14, the Chinese Chang'E 1, and, most recently, from the European SMART-1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22e/256/a45/22e256a4508140f78d18943ff3aedf8f.jpg" alt="image" width="800"><br>  [Traces of the fall of the Apollo 12 take-off stage.  Image Credit: NASA / Philip J. Stooke] <br><br>  It was a little surprised (besides the topic itself) that many falls leave behind not craters at all, but streaks and stripes.  Apparently, speeds of 1 km / s and below are not enough for the explosive destruction of the vehicle or the ground, and sliding contact simply leads to splitting debris at long distances along the direction of the orbit. <br>  --- === --- <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/2245.pdf">SIZE AND SOLAR INCIDENCE DISTRIBUTION OF SHADOWS ON THE MOON</a></b> <br><br>  It is hard to believe that the Moon, which has been investigated for more than half a century, has been photographed in the 30-centimeter resolution ‚Äúphotographed from the face and the back,‚Äù <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_artificial_objects_on_the_Moon">covered with 180 tons of human garbage</a> , can even conceal something mysterious.  Yes, and in such a banal, it would seem, things like shadows. <br><br>  And yet. <br><br>  The authors engaged in a simple and seemingly boring activity.  They began to study the size of the lunar shadows.  Statistics in its purest form.  But not obvious.  After all, shadow is a complicated thing.  With the "sliding" morning fall of the rays on the characteristics of the relief depends extremely nontrivially. <br><br>  And dug up.  The density of shadows with sizes of 3-100 meters, firstly, does not depend on their size, and secondly, it does not have a clear explanation.  So, there is something in the distribution of the lunar surface bumps on these scales, which we do not yet understand.  People at the conference asked clever questions, compared something with the distribution of crater sizes, were surprised, but I will not undertake to retell it. <br><br>  It would seem that the golemish statistics of black and white spots, but brought to mind - and now it turns out that on the long-studied Moon another mystery lies.

So, in the USSR, in 1976, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12678121">microorganisms were brought</a> from altitudes of 48-77 kilometers.  But the Japanese Aerospace Agency (JAXA) is so remarkable that it constantly inventing interesting projects for fairly reasonable money. <br><br>  The fact is that usually such studies rely on the cultivation of the extracted samples in the laboratory.  We sow, grow, analyze what has grown.  The problem, however, is that <a href="http://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540854647">over 99% of terrestrial microorganisms are non-cultured</a> .  They do not know how to grow in the laboratory.  Accordingly, 99% of the species diversity of this approach from the "catch" is lost. <br><br>  The Japanese bypassed this difficulty by simply examining <b>all the</b> extracted samples with a fluorescence and scanning electron microscope.  And although their balloon brought germs from relatively ‚Äúmodest‚Äù heights of 13-27 km, this is the first assessment of the density of all (including uncultivated) microorganisms in the stratosphere. <br><br>  Unfortunately, during the flight they managed to lose the test (for negative control) camera.  For what reason do they plan to repeat the launch in June 2017 in combination, if I heard correctly, with the genetic analysis of the microorganisms obtained. <br>  --- === --- <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/2613.pdf">SURVIVABILITY OF RNA AND PROTEIN MONOMERS AGAINST EFFECTS OF SHOCK PRESSURES</a></b> <br><br>  Suppose a meteorite with terrestrial DNA crashes into another planet.  Explosion, pressure surge, instant warm-up.  Will organics survive this adventure?  To find out, the authors fired artificial "meteorites" with an admixture of proteins and ribonucleic acids at targets and measured how much organic matter would survive after the impact.  It turns out not very much: <br><br><blockquote>  Impact pressure - (corresponding to it speed) -% safety: <br>  10.5 GPa - (~ 2.2 km / s) - 4.3% <br>  28 GPa - (~ 4 km / s) - 0.7% <br>  40 GPA - (~ 6 km / s) - 0% </blockquote><br>  Does this mean that panspermia does not work?  Certainly not.  You can think of a lot more gentle ways of delivering organic meteorites.  But, in any case, a direct, airless ‚Äúhead-on‚Äù impact on a body the size of Mars seems to be fatal even for relatively simple organic molecules. <br>  --- === --- <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/2922.pdf">PULMONARY INFLAMMATORY RESPONSES TO ACUTE METEORITE DUST EXPOSURES - IMPLICATIONS FOR HUMAN SPACE EXPLORATION</a></b> <br><br>  This topic is not new.  I read somewhere in the 95th year that moon dust is very harmful to the lungs and causes strong silicosis in laboratory rats. <br><br>  In this paper, we investigated the inflammatory stress response ("inflammatory stress response") of human lung tissue to lunar, Martian dust, from Vesta, and terrestrial.  The first three are extracted from meteorites from the corresponding bodies, the last - from earthly basalts. <br><br>  The observations are disappointing.  All types of dust have a very noticeable and negative effect on the lungs.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the most vicious dust is the Martian dust, it is comparable in effect to the earth‚Äôs mining sludge, from which people are seriously ill. Behind her comes the moon dust. The ground gravel basalts showed the least harm, although, of course, they are also not honey. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/988/036/11a/98803611ab8248788157c0523b45ac2e.jpg" alt="image" width="400"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[Picture from the work described.

First, if people ever set foot on Mars, they will have to defend themselves from dust seriously (so my stack of sheets of marked inaccuracies and comments on the Martian was replenished with one more item). Secondly, we sometimes sometimes underestimate the role of dust in planned long-term expeditions. Moon dust, for example, has a terrible abrasive ability, leading to the rapid killing of moving mechanisms and rubbing surfaces.

But it is reliably known that at least one episode of warming happened there a long time ago, with a warm dense atmosphere and liquid water, from which the river beds remained. How long, how long and what caused this favorable climate? This is where the various hypotheses begin. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">One of them was put forward in the work in question. Quite funny, like "the fire was caused by a fire engine that arrived on a false call." There it is argued that the warming period was a response to the first collapse of the atmosphere. Which caused the release of enormous quantities of methane, previously stored in the soil in the form of </font></font><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methane_clathrate"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">methane clathrates</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">. The oxidation and photolysis products of this methane caused a strong greenhouse effect and warming. Is it all really, I do not presume to judge.

But the most straightforward project is unlikely to work. Its essence is that, by evaporating enough carbon dioxide CO </font></font><sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2</font></font></sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> from the Martian polar caps, you can (would) enhance the greenhouse effect to such an extent that the climate on Mars becomes warm and self-sustaining. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">However, having conducted an audit of CO </font></font><sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">2</font></font></sub><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> reserves </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">on Mars using the most recent data, the authors came to the same conclusion that I </font></font><a href="http://tung-sten.no-ip.com/Texts/Popsci/Mars.Climate/Mars.Climate.htm"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">received</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> more crude methods </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in 2006. Namely, carbon dioxide reserves on Mars are not enough to implement this scenario; and even the evaporation of all polar caps will warm the planet only by about 10 degrees, which is not enough to go into a self-sustaining warm regime. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">--- === ---</font></font><br><br> <b><a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/1357.pdf"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">EFFICIENCY OF ATMOSPHERIC EROSION BY IMPACTS: ENERGY CONSIDERATIONS AND APPLICATIONS</font></font></a></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> First, there is such a thing as Shuvalov‚Äôs parameters. These are formulas linking the efficiency of "scattering" the atmosphere of an asteroid falling on the planet with the parameters of the asteroid and the atmosphere:</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/783/dfb/2ee/783dfb2eeb884cecaab379275a387a2e.jpg" alt="image" width="400"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Secondly, this efficiency has a maximum. A meteorite too large or too fast has a worse efficiency of "stripping" of the atmosphere than its smaller counterpart:</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/907/0f9/884/9070f9884afd482d93e7510f5667ad6f.jpg" alt="image" width="400"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">[The efficiency of atmospheric ablation by an asteroid as a function of the Shuvalov parameter Œæ.

Sci. 44, 1095-1105.]</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Third, by choosing the asteroids of maximum efficiency, one can calculate how much they will need to ‚Äúdisrupt‚Äù most of the atmosphere of Venus. The answer is a lot. Unreal many. We are talking about the masses in (0.5-9)% of the mass of the moon. The upper bound of this estimate exceeds the mass of the asteroid belt. It can be roughly estimated that the kinetic energy required to reject such a breakthrough of asteroids is at least ~ 10 </font></font><sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">27</font></font></sup><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Joules, which is a million times higher than the annual energy budget of mankind. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thus, the projects of terraforming of Venus by ‚Äúblowing out‚Äù of its atmosphere remain, at best, science fiction. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">--- === --- </font></font><br><br> <b><a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/pdf/1583.pdf"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">OCEANUS: Planetary Science Summer School: Uranus Orbiter Concept Study from the 2016 NASA / JPL </font></font></a></b> <br> <b><a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/eposter/1583.pdf"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Electronic Poster</font></font></a></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Pros: NASA finally decided to consider the concept of a serious expedition to Uranus. With an exit into an orbit and a landing probe. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Cons: everything is very preliminary. Students do this. It is not known what class the mission will be, and this radically determines the budget for the financial, mass, and general layout of the station. Therefore, several very different concepts are being worked out simultaneously in parallel. The launch, if it takes place, is not earlier than the year 2030, with arrival to Uranus in the 2040s. In general, if you manage to live and get lucky with health, then perhaps it will be interesting to me. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Update: at the NASO briefing, however, broader work on this topic was announced (picture from the video briefing, </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">not</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> from the title work), so perhaps everything will be somewhat more optimistic:</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/94c/e30/70e/94ce3070e08b41ad9417f1dec0530a7e.jpg" alt="image" width="400"><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">--- === --- </font></font><br><br> <b><a href="http://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2017/eposter/1448.pdf"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A GEOPHYSICAL PLANET DEFINITION</font></font></a></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> From a geophysical point of view, Pluto and all rather large bodies like Titan, Europe or Ganymede are full-fledged planets. When describing them, most of the features inherent in "real" planets are mentioned (equilibrium spherical shape, differentiation, tectonic activity, atmosphere, features of surface renewal and formation processes, thermal history). In the textbooks of planetology, Pluto or Ganymede is more natural and more logical described in the same section with Mars and Venus, rather than with small asteroids. The language used to describe Pluto is </font></font><a href="http://www.bobukh.com/Texts/Popsci/PlanetDefinition/Text.htm"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">much closer to the "Martian" than to the "cometary</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font><a href="http://www.bobukh.com/Texts/Popsci/PlanetDefinition/Text.htm"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">"</font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Finally, the authors cite more than 40 scientific works from refereed journals, where Titan and Europe are referred to as planets.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And all this does not depend on the fact whether "the body cleared its orbit". </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, the authors of this paper propose to ‚Äústop the disgrace‚Äù with dwarf planets and, without waiting for permits (which are not required) from the International Astronomical Union, to begin, finally, just to call all these bodies planets. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">--- === --- </font></font><br><br> <b><a href="https://livestream.com/viewnow/LPSC2017/videos/152254034"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Planetary Topography from Laser Altimetry A</font></font></a></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> lecture about laser altimeters around other planets.
