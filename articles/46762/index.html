      It is curious to completely different, why in the 21st century, students still have to spend hundreds of hours going nowhere? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  But, as they say "everyone can criticize, and you offer the best."  Therefore, I will not write criticism. <br>  As we all know, such a thing as a ‚Äúnetbook‚Äù is becoming more accessible.  And within 10 tr.  Already, you can easily purchase this device. <br><br>  <b>What are the benefits that I personally see for students and universities would be from him?</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Do not write lectures.  And waste time writing only.  Isn't it better to spend this time analyzing the lecture?  To work together?  The whole stream to discuss issues that are usually only recorded, and their analysis is left "at home".  After all, units then sit at home and ‚Äúanalyze‚Äù.  The teacher can easily read it, explain the controversial points, and not ‚Äúhave time to write everything down‚Äù. </li><li>  Everything is ready.  Even if I missed the so-called lecture, there is no need to ‚Äúsearch and rewrite lectures.‚Äù  They are already there.  Sit down and learn.  Learn normally, and not just to pass.  Do not lie to show the rewritten notebook. </li><li>  At the end of each lesson, you can conduct a rapid test.  Not rated.  Just a test for the development of the material.  You say "write off the same."  So and so will write off those who need.  But the teacher will be able to adapt to the students, somewhere to change something, etc. </li><li>  It is easier for a student to find something in preparation for practical exercises. </li><li>  People from college will already know the basics of PC.  And not everyone knows them.  Yes Yes Yes. </li><li>  Exam preparation is also more convenient. </li><li>  Creating essay-kursovikov also becomes more convenient. </li><li>  And most importantly: there is an opportunity to work out the tasks / theory more precisely, etc.  and not just "write / pass / forget." </li></ol><br><br>  <b>But any ‚Äúidea‚Äù has its drawbacks, naturally.</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Financing.  Imaginary minus  Any university has a so-called ‚Äúpayroll‚Äù (I myself belong to them).  Nothing prevents these contributions from buying netbooks for 8-10 tr.  (although wholesale is cheaper).  To state employees to issue, for example, in temporary use with gradual payment of its price.  Well, either in dreams, it is natural to finance state employees at the expense of the state (ie, our taxes). </li><li>  Internet and network.  The Internet in this case is not very necessary.  It is possible to build a Wi-Fi network and server with all the tutorials. </li><li>  Electricity.  This is one of the most important disadvantages.  If the netbook works for about 6 hours, then it is on average only 3 pairs.  What if there are 6 of them?  this is the minus to which I can not answer ... </li></ol><br><br>  Afterword: <br><br>  I do not pretend to the originality of the idea, its perfection, and the like. <br>  But lately it has become increasingly annoying that a lot of time is being spent, which can be spent more effectively for education in the process of education itself using the possibilities of our time ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46762/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46762/</a></p>
