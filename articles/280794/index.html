A guideline is generated in which all common styles are graphically represented.

Classic operating systems are mouse controlled and interface elements can be relatively small.  In addition, they have hot keys, context menus and a bunch of other solutions that allow you to fit more possibilities on the existing screen.  At the same time, most of these things are not in mobile OSs, and even the requirements for a minimally comfortable area of ‚Äã‚Äãdepression are higher.
