  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Inexpensive and with LTE. Highscreen Spider smartphone review</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In Russia, 4G networks are built faster than their network of the previous generation.  There is no annual statistics yet, but in the first six months of 2014, the number of 4G base stations <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/tech/news/32442821/skorostnoe-rasprostranenie-4g">increased</a> by 75%.  The number of subscribers using LTE networks is also increasing, now there are more than 3 million of them.  As a result, the number of LTE devices on the Russian market (and the demand for them) is growing.  In late summer, the first low-cost LTE smartphone with a 4-core processor, Highscreen Spider, appeared in Russia.  A few months later, the model has not lost its relevance (counterarguments are accepted and welcomed), so today I will tell you more about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/619/0bd/b09/6190bdb09dc3474fb37eb947b1326e33.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Almost all new flagship smartphones support LTE, which can't be said about the segment of low-cost devices.  In the price category up to 8,000 rubles, there are only a few devices operating in 4G networks.  Most of them have not the most advanced features (small screen, weak processor).  In this regard, Highscreen Spider, which has received a good hardware platform, successfully stands out against other low-cost LTE smartphones. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Specifications</font> </h2><br>  <b>Operating system:</b> Android 4.3 <br>  <b>Processor:</b> Qualcomm Snapdragon 400, 4 cores, 1.2 GHz <br>  <b>Graphics accelerator:</b> Adreno 305 <br>  <b>Display:</b> 5 inches, 1280x720, IPS, OGS <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 1 GB <br>  <b>ROM:</b> 8 GB <br>  <b>Memory Card:</b> microSD / SDHC up to 32 GB <br>  <b>Network:</b> GSM / GPRS / EDGE (850/900/1800/1900 MHz);  UMTS / HSPA (900/2100 MHz);  LTE: 1/3/7/20 <br>  <b>Wireless:</b> 802.11 a / b / g / n, Bluetooth 3.0 EDR <br>  <b>Cameras:</b> main 8 megapixel, frontal 2 megapixel. <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS / GLONASS <br>  <b>Battery:</b> removable, lithium-ion, 2,000 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 145 √ó 71.5 √ó 8.95 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 164 g <br>  <b>Price:</b> 7 990 rubles.

    <h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Package and design</font> </h2><br>  In the original packaging from recycled cardboard is a standard set: the smartphone itself, a charger, a USB cable, a battery (with a capacity of 2000 mAh), headphones and various pieces of paper.  I must say that the headphones are the most common, without any claims to high-quality sound.  They will go for telephone conversations, but for music lovers to listen to music it is better to use something more serious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b8/4c5/e13/1b84c5e1323746178445b120694143d8.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2de/77e/adc/2de77eadce004248a2ff1b3bd1217632.JPG"><br><br>  Highscreen Spider is presented only in black.  The smartphone case is made of plastic, at the back cover - soft-touch coating, resistant to fingerprints and minor scratches.  The device is assembled quite soundly: it does not creak when pressed, the buttons ‚Äúwalk‚Äù smoothly, there are no gaps. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff6/ca3/423/ff6ca3423561402cab4cada8030c3fea.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/05d/4fb/6b0/05d4fb6b07504710ba142455f1c3dd2d.JPG"><br><br>  Controls and various connectors are located as standard.  Above - a headphone jack, below - a microUSB port and a microphone hole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7c4/437/32d/7c443732d93c49f9b61dd609c34505f6.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aba/505/2a0/aba5052a0eb5404bbee16d36486f6e8d.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e8/641/58b/1e864158bd194aaf89c95c1a708870b5.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b43/6e8/e0f/b436e8e0f2484b7abb280b821c7a95a0.JPG"><br><br>  Above the screen is a speaker, front camera (2 megapixels), proximity sensors and light.  Below the display are three classic Android-smartphone buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcd/54e/351/dcd54e35186143fda297ca5118772432.JPG"><br><br>  On the left side there is a volume rocker, on the right there is a power off and lock button.  At the bottom of the back panel is the main speaker with two small protrusions at the edges.  They provide a normal sound output, if the smartphone is put on its back, the volume decreases slightly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04b/cf4/195/04bcf41954d240758d30f9b4bc42436d.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30f/a68/ce8/30fa68ce89744893b790407998ac3d2a.JPG"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Display</font> </h2><br>  Highscreen Spider is equipped with a 5-inch display with a resolution of 1280x720.  The pixels ‚Äúsit‚Äù quite tightly, the PPI is 294. The smartphone uses an IPS-matrix (manufactured by AU Optronics Corp, Taiwan) using OGS technology.  One Glass Solution - the absence of an air gap of the screen, thanks to which the screen has a good color and wide viewing angles.  The sensor supports five simultaneous touches. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Hardware platform</font> </h2><br>  As noted earlier, Highscreen Spider is based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 MSM8926 chipset with a 4-core Cortex A7 processor (1.2 GHz).  In the role of a graphics accelerator - Adreno 305 chip. The RAM is 1 GB, and for data storage - 8 GB.  Much of the internal memory is occupied by system files, so support for microSD memory cards is very helpful.  Alternatively, you can use the "cloud". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a31/230/d69/a31230d6917f436da09302343c735398.JPG"><br><br>  All owners of Highscreen Spider 4Sync cloud service provides 128 GB of free file storage.  To use a nice gift, you just need to register a new account from this smartphone.  In general, 4Sync is actually the most remarkable addition in the local Android 4.3, otherwise the system is presented "as is", without any modifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/717/a90/434/717a904345dc487ca8d196046d2d19bd.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/483/7e5/67e/4837e567e5c54da1a9e0b1f31f92a749.png"><br><br>  Video up to 720p is perfectly reproduced with software decoding.  Since 1080p is no longer so straightforward: a hardware decoder is coping somewhere, and a slowdown can be observed somewhere. <br><br>  As for the games, here Highscreen Spider did not upset.  Angry Birds, Plants vs Zombies 2, Asphalt 8, Modern Combat 4 and Shadowgun: DeadZone games run without lags, even with maximum brightness settings.  But GTA: San Andreas freezes at maximum settings.  What can I say - the game from Rockstar has a high level of detail and is very demanding on resources.  It was originally designed for more productive gadgets, which in the category of 7-10 thousand rubles are not yet found. <br><br>  In AnTuTu Benchmark, the device scored about 17,000 points, which, in general, is very decent (again, for the price category ‚Äúup to 8 thousand‚Äù). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/45f/5c0/8eb/45f5c08eb2854e8880853f331336676e.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec6/322/8e8/ec63228e855d493c9d72ec3bed196105.png"><br><br>  A 2000 mAh battery provides the smartphone with an average of two days of work without recharging.  In a more saturated mode of use will have to be charged every day.  3D games discharge the smartphone in 3.5 hours, video in 5 hours, and music in 27 hours.  By the way, in Highscreen Spider, a useful utility <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.xiam.snapdragon.app%26hl%3Dru">Qualcomm BatteryGuru</a> , which in the background optimizes power consumption, is already preinstalled. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Connection</font> </h2><br>  LTE communication is quickly established in all networks of the ‚ÄúBig Three‚Äù.  The difference in file transfer speed compared to 3G is very noticeable.  Download speed reaches 25 Mbps, which is almost 2-3 times faster than on 3G connections in the same zones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e54/c75/5cc/e54c755cc76d469abf865caf784ca712.JPG"><br><br>  In addition to the American GPS, Highscreen Spider still catches the satellites of the Russian GLONASS.  In fact, this means faster connection and more stable communication, the difference is especially noticeable where there are interferences for receiving signals from satellites - high-rise areas, departures from tunnels and the like. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Camera</font> </h2><br>  The resolution of the main camera is 8 megapixel, in daylight on the Highscreen Spider you can shoot good shots.  The maximum video resolution when shooting is 1920x1080 pixels.  The front camera has a resolution of 2 megapixels - enough to communicate in video chat.  Here are some photos taken in different conditions: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0e/d87/76d/c0ed8776d3674f2c8ebf4aaec85a7ee7.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c5/ef0/e61/3c5ef0e613be40afa64e5b642bbf0b4c.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8a/680/07e/a8a68007e595406692861441e2eeede5.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14a/7ea/51d/14a7ea51d32d48c5a05d5b8650fdeb01.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <a href="">Download original photographs</a> (10.3 MB) <br><br><h2>  <font color="#5fccef">Conclusion</font> </h2><br>  At the time of this writing, the price of Highscreen Spider is 7990 rubles - for this money the smartphone received high-quality stuffing, a good HD-screen and LTE support that is currently relevant.  Similar in characteristics smartphones have a price tag of 2-3 thousand rubles higher, and this despite the fact that the Spider appeared a few months ago.  The only noticeable disadvantage of a smartphone is not the latest version of Android 4.3.  Also, it may seem to someone a small amount of memory available to the user - to some extent this trouble is compensated by free cloud storage from 4Sync with a capacity of 128 GB, or the ability to purchase a memory card.  Otherwise, Highscreen Spider - strong middling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/834/284/f70/834284f705044409a6ef6a4a79b8d1b7.JPG"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364053/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364053/</a></p>
