  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Have a website or blog with RSS? Then make the mobile version easy!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Everyone has long understood that you can't get away from cell phones, and as a result, you can't get away from the fact that your blog will be read from the screen of a mobile phone.  And even if <a href="http://absolvo.ru/">my blog</a> from a mobile phone is visited by no more than 10 people per month, I decided to make a mobile version.  But so, as I am lazy to impossibility, I found a way to make an acceptable mobile version in a very short time.  And not only the blog, but also any site that gives an RSS feed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img title="logo11" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13a/fa1/75d/13afa175d98f2fb3e661c03150090fc5.png" width="264" height="494"><br>  Let's start with what I wanted to do: <br><br>  If the first two methods take a lot of time, the third one is just terrible and it is not even discussed by default, since I love my readers :) <br><br>  But by chance, I stumbled upon a service that allows you to make a mobile version of a blog very quickly and relatively well.  Below I will give a link to it, but first a review, which, I am afraid, may tire you a little.

      I think today blogs are simply obliged to have a mobile version of the site.  And it's not even that mobile phones cannot digest the normal version of a blog, but the fact that it is quite expensive, with Russian prices for mobile traffic. <br><br>  What can do the service, which I am telling you?  A lot, just a lot.  I will go through the menu items.  Which interested me, and briefly describe them.  The rest you can easily see for yourself. <br><br>  <strong>Custom Domain</strong> <br>  You can use the mobile version of your blog on a separate domain simply by playing with CNAME in the DNS settings.  True, it takes, for some reason, 48 hours.  Someday I will definitely do this, but now I am lazy to throw out 770 rubles a year on absolvo.mobi.  Or somewhere it can be "issued" cheaper? <br><img title="domen" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af4/66d/161/af466d16144c62f19d2c15fc68a870e6.png" width="500" height="149"><br><br>  <strong>Design Your Mobile Site</strong> <br>  It is possible to customize the color of your mobile version.  Somehow it happened, the default colors are very close to the colors of my blog, because I did not touch the settings.  maybe a little later I will play with shades. <br><img title="color" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/010/33b/fc3/01033bfc36b36f027de6fb80156282d7.png" width="500" height="204"><br><br>  <strong>Custom Logo</strong> <br>  If you have a logo, then use it, restrictions up to 500kb for the uploaded image.  I managed, although I have a logo - a favicon in a large size - I would only find it now. <br><br>  <strong>Editing homepage</strong> <br>  You can leave your text on the main page, for example with contacts or description.  And it is possible on all pages - this is done by ticking <strong>Show on every page</strong> ? <br><br>  <strong>Add an RSS feed</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  The fact is that this service, in addition to its direct destination, can be used as a mobile RSS feed reader.  Add them, edit and of course, read.  I have not tried it yet, but Habr, a couple of blogs and a news line are already packed - on Monday, we‚Äôll check on the way to work. <br><br>  <strong>Comment Widget</strong> <br>  If you enable this option, comments will be left at the service site, and trackbacks will come to your blog if your blog can work with them (WP can, for example). <br><br>  <strong>Click to Call Link</strong> <br>  Very convenient option - clicked-called.  In the top of the page there is a link to "call the owner," the text, of course, you can specify yourself.  True, I'm not sure that it works with non-WM and Apple phones, although everything should work, in fact. <br><br>  <strong>Automatic redirect</strong> <br>  In my opinion a controversial option.  You are given a code that you embed on your blog (more precisely in the header) and when you access any page from your mobile phone (HTTP_USER_AGENT is checked) you are redirected to the mobile version of the blog. <br><br>  <strong>Visitor Count Chicklet</strong> <br>  The counter of visits to the mobile version of the blog.  Externally - a copy of feedburner'a - hanging in my <a href="http://absolvo.ru/statistika/">statistics</a> , the index decided not to make.  Boast, I hope so far, nothing :) <br><br>  <strong>Mobile Badge</strong> <br>  Service buttons.  Not very much and all not very pretty. <br><br>  <strong>QR Code</strong> <br>  Unfortunately, for our country is not very relevant.  Although I think about myself shirt with him print.  :) And what about girls? <br><img title="qr" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ef7/45b/69a/ef745b69a63bd30127ff87ee9ba3e43d.png" width="266" height="261"><br><br>  <strong>Analytics</strong> <br>  Quite detailed statistics and analysis of visitors to the mobile version of the blog.  While there is empty, because I can not say anything about the fairness of statistics and the adequacy of the analysis.  Later, if anyone is curious, I can report on a personal basis, or on <a href="http://absolvo.ru/twitter/">Twitter</a> . <br><img title="stat" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c1/771/8a3/6c17718a34e32ea36891905dceb8f3d9.png" width="500" height="449"><br><br>  <strong>Monetize</strong> <br>  On the mobile version, you can also earn extra money, for example, on Google AdSense or on AdMob (I already guess that it will be more popular in RuNet). <br><img title="ad" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e46/0c3/1cc/e460c31cc074758c785c37acbd22552c.png" width="500" height="512"><br><br>  <strong>iPhone Settings</strong> <br>  You can prepare your own version for iPhone.  It looks pretty tasty on the iPhone itself. The main thing is that there should be pictures in the text itself - it will look even better. <br><br>  <strong>Site Demographics</strong> <br>  If you decide to earn extra money on a mobile version of the blog, then indicate your target audience - help yourself make money.  From where you learn it, as it is clear, the service is not interested. <br><br>  And the last thing, apart from the account settings and other very ordinary sections, is a preview ‚Äî <a href="http://absolvo.mofuse.mobi/">absolvo.mofuse.mobi/</a> ‚Äî this is a preview of my blog ‚Äî it seems to me that it is quite suitable for working with it. <br><br>  Although the service is American, there are no problems with the Russian language, but the interface is all English-speaking. <br><br>  I almost forgot a rather important detail - there should be an RSS feed on your blog or site.  This service works with him.  I almost forgot to give you a link to this service - <a href="http://mofuse.com/">mofuse.com</a> . <br><br>  On the main page you can see, in the form of a preview, what your mobile version will look like. <br><br>  In general, I recommend to familiarize, and for bloggers, IMHO, a good alternative to some crafts on the knee.  Do not suffer - there is a service, it is free - so why not? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44479/</a></p>
