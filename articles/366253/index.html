  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Three budget quadcopters with cameras in the historical museum "Kolomenskoye"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, I described the most budget quadcopters in the world for <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/244822/">$ 20 without a camera</a> and for <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/245134/">$ 35 with a video camera</a> , but today I have prepared a material about three very different quadcopters: <br>  1. One is a bit clumsy, of modest size, with a weak camera, but very budgetary - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/u3">Top Selling X6</a> . <br>  2. The second one has a more significant size, has a decent enough camera on board, but still fits into the category of budget quadcopters for $ 30-60 - <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/u4">SYMA X5C</a> . <br>  3. The third one hears not the first year and has already managed to recommend itself, this is the most budget version from DJI - Phantom 1, although its budget immediately increases the gap from the second 10 times. <br><br>  All these 3 quadcopters went to fly to the former royal residence and patrimony, and now - the State Art Historical-Architectural and Natural Landscape Museum-Reserve "Kolomenskoye". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b41/c4f/037/b41c4f03752745a5be86531a01a98f56.JPG">

      Spring came and quadrocopters flew. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I wanted to compare quadcopters of different price levels in order to understand what makes them different and for which we overpay or underpay. <br><br>  Available were: <br><br>  Toplling X6: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5bc/5cf/8ec/5bc5cf8ec0f749cbac27f7c783426b85.JPG"><br><br>  And Phantom 1: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/654/6f3/462/6546f3462103465fb4c12de9b5c99193.JPG"><br><br>  But there was not enough quadrocopter a bit more expensive than the first and definitely cheaper than the second.  I immediately recalled the SYMA X5C, which looks like a reduced copy of a candy wrapper and costs quite reasonable money, and looking at the fact that the Chinese seller sold 2000 copies for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/zb">~ $ 60 (with a camera)</a> - I was finally convinced of my choice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/424/189/fd3/424189fd35eb450dbf4b10b9402c1ec6.JPG"><br>  In reality, he was really very beautiful. <br><br>  Buying a third copter for myself was somewhat "fat", so I decided to take the opportunity and make a gift to my father on February 23, naturally having previously tested it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/886/714/194/886714194bb24f1f9c9e1adf2113b0c5.jpg"><br><br>  There was no hope that they would deliver from China by the right time, so I turned to my friend from Moscow State University, who had already helped me buy the first 2 quadcopters and <a href="https://rc-like.ru/syma-x5c-4-channel-2-4g-remote-control-rc-quadcopter-10%253B-10%253B">Syma X5C</a> was also found in his stocks, and considering that the first 2 quadcopters were excellent quality - I immediately left for the desired drone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3eb/9d8/3b2/3eb9d83b2f9945428b6f4a8415afa78b.JPG"><br><br>  And finally, tearing off the <a href="http://megarand.ru/">MegaRand</a> startup <a href="http://megarand.ru/">team</a> from development, we went straight to the Kolomenskoye Museum-Reserve.  Alas, the weather did not give us a big gift, so the shooting was rather gloomy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f4/2f7/253/1f42f725388e40669f9f59f8aaf4466e.JPG"><br><br>  However, quadcopters make life much more fun, so the weather did not prevent us from having a good time.  Here, for example, we staged a race on quadrocopters in a straight line, although only two batteries were enough to get to this stage. <br><br>  <b>Caution!</b>  Obscene language! <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zO65ccp1Q0A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg15b2F51_7L5OQ8GXSfOrBsulmsA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Of course, I won a phantom in this race, but at the start there was a moment when the Sim was ahead of everyone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/695/9f2/08a/6959f208a2804727992d5546d6a0e24e.jpg"><br><br>  I also most likely flew in battery saving mode, as the phantom soon got a battery, and it seemed that Sim only warmed up and began to make flips (forward / backward and lateral) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/sbXQF8wUn1s%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjU-hrqw812rJylprmFfI4pk1H0MQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  And yes, of course, the launch of the quadrocopter by throwing looks very impressive.  It is very convenient that from any throw the quadrocopter turns over like a cat on its feet and quickly soars upwards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f69/82d/52e/f6982d52eebc4fa29c47ebeadd7bf5b7.JPG"><br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  <b>DJI Phantom 1 is</b> definitely still good.  Smooth movements, stable hang-up on a point using GPS satellites, precise and easy operation and of course the ability to carry gopro on board is an unshakable advantage, since the quality of the shooting is simply not comparable with the built-in cameras. <br><br>  His battery showed quite a decent result, having lasted about 7-10 minutes, and considering that the batteries of this model are relatively affordable ($ 22.99), then you can have a few pieces in your arsenal enough for a full-fledged survey.  But in general, the price of such a drone is justified only if you really need it. <br><br>  That is, we have a wrapper <b>‚Ññ1 for commercial activities</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97e/bea/afe/97ebeaafe72c411381998f35c7b51a69.JPG"><br><br>  <b>X6 is</b> certainly the most brisk quadrocopter, even with the protection of screws, it is not so easy to plant on trees, as it easily flies between any branches, and due to its low weight, even from high altitude it threatens to fall only with fear.  However, it is possible to break it, since it accelerates very quickly and if it encounters a pillar on its way, the hull can crack and the screws get lost.  Perhaps that is why in China " <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/u3">crash sets</a> " with new cases and screws are actively sold. <br><br>  At the same time, he has very small screws and can only be a bit beaten about your fingers, and with the protection of the blades you can fly even next to the children. <br><br>  In any case, for its agility and safety, the X6 is <b>No. 1 for home indulgence</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e60/a7c/8ce/e60a7c8ceea24d11961b783087cf8467.jpg"><br><br>  <b>SYMA X5C</b> - this quadrocopter has become a real discovery for me.  I really haven't had so much fun with a quadrocopter for quite a while. <br><br>  Nimble takeoff <br>  Stable flight <br>  Wind Sim will not carry <br>  Snow in the peritoneum will not pass <br><br>  Flips sharply crank <br>  The battery will not die <br>  A lot of space will not take <br>  Throw simu start <br><br>  Money does not devour much <br>  Weighs not carrying much <br>  Crash will survive <br>  That's because Sim, damn, gives! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b92/dad/905/b92dad905afa45138839dfc37f991bd1.JPG"><br><br>  I think in my happy face on all frames with a sim (even when I take it out of the tree) you can understand that I get incredible pleasure and it is not just that.  This quadcopter is really perfect for flying on the street, if you do not have much experience.  Although even if there is experience, flips (flips) in all directions, speed in fast mode and launch from the roll - you will definitely be very pleased. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e7/fae/27b/7e7fae27bb8f4f449d2cc94913e82e31.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, I did not start the video shooting, as I didn‚Äôt immediately understand the instructions and only filmed in the end at home, but you can appreciate the video here. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wqtAhU2jukw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjEEpNBbHbFWd1DnriogzpTcmGbxA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  This is very similar to the truth. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say that each of the tested quadcopters has its pros and cons, but the main thing is that in general the flight on each of them gives an incredible feeling and I want to try it at least once in a lifetime. <br><br>  Start of rescue operation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/422/ce1/f2f/422ce1f2fcd348bcae5bc682e47b64a2.JPG"><br><br>  End of rescue operation: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b41/c4f/037/b41c4f03752745a5be86531a01a98f56.JPG"><br><br>  ps Thanks for the help in preparing the post for the drone guide Lyokha and Max and special thanks to our photographer <a href="http://odal.me/">Oleg</a> ! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c20/e7c/e57/c20e7ce575944899bcdbd3ea299632d6.JPG"><br>  "Try flying once, and your eyes will forever be fixed in the sky" <br><br>  pps By the way, as it turned out, it is impossible to fly in a museum-reserve, but the guards are quite loyal and under their strict control, we flew safely around historic buildings.  True, then came some strict chief and turned off our event, so many thanks to the local guards for allowing us to fly a little.  And we apologize if you got out of us. <br><br> <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/vp"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a1a/bb8/6ef/a1abb86ef1faa35e01779c9805ddbbfc.gif" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <b>Our other publications:</b> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/270698/">Overview of the powerful tablet Chuwi Hi10 on a full Win10 for $ 180</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/270254/">15 little things from heaven about which you would like to know</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/271064/">15 cool little things for the geek from the Middle Kingdom.</a>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/271064/">Part 2</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269722/">Classes of quadcopters - which are and are used for</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/270618/">Seven current copters up to $ 20, which can be put in your pocket</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269498/">Our little joy or budget than to please yourself on February 23?</a> <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269526/">Xiaomi company.</a>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/269526/">Cheaper without damage to quality is no longer</a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/267722/">Chuwi Ilife V5 - a $ 99 robot vacuum cleaner or how to turn daily cleaning into entertainment</a> <br>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/dronk/blog/266778/">NEJE engraver laser overview or promising business model</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366253/</a></p>
