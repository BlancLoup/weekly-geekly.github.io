In this article I want to share with you a valuable experience in paying for purchases using VISA cards issued by Sberbank, as well as to warn you that the course of upgrading Sberbank has rather unpleasant consequences for their customers. <br><br>  Sberbank once again distinguished itself for its advancement, adaptability and focus on convenience for the client, which finally convinced me not to have anything in common with him even at gunpoint. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Arriving at the airport in Frankfurt, I decided not to waste time, and from there, via the Internet, order tickets for the Novosibirsk-Biysk train.  We arrived in Novosibirsk at around 18 o'clock local time, and the Novosibirsk-Biysk train departs at 20:40 local time.  This could not but rejoice, since the transit time was only about three hours, instead of days (this train runs once a day).  There was no time and desire to run to the station and stand there for hours in the queue, and there was not enough cash in rubles with me.  RZD has the so-called e-Ticket, which allows not to buy tickets at the box office, defending in a huge queue, and simply print it, and then come up and register it with the car. <br>  Let me think through the Internet will order and pay for a visa.  My wife had a Visa from Sberbank with the necessary amount on the account. <br><br>  We went to the site of the Russian Railways, issued tickets - go to the payment.  Specify the card data (CCV / Valid date, etc.) and click "Buy".  The server thought a little and threw it onto the Sberbank processing server, it displayed data about the card, its holder and the amount to be paid.  At the very bottom, it was written in bold green "corporate" font (Arial Bold) "ORDER NUMBER XXXXXX" (which I saw on the third attempt).  Click "Pay". 
      <br>

      And then my eyes see a masterpiece in the style of dullness and post-idiotism - on the screen there was something that embarrassed me at first, then I couldn't be angry, and then I just laughed for a long time in hysterics. <br><br>  On the screen was beautiful: <br>  ‚ÄúDear customer, your payment has been accepted.  For your security, all transactions are made with a one-time password.  A one-time password is listed on the check, which you can get at any branch of the bank or print it out at an ATM and indicate the order number. <br>  Operation number XXXXXXX.  Date XX / XX / XXXX. ‚ÄùAnd the form for entering this one-time password. <br><br>  <i>Caution!</i>  <i>A lot of emotions.</i> <br><br>  And what the <s>fuck</s> do I have to do with it? <br>  This I must now rush to the nearest Sberovskiy ATM in Frankfurt (no one will tell where he is there)?  Print this fucking check, using the services of a hypnotist, since the order number was shown on the previous screen and I naturally don‚Äôt remember it (by the way, the back buttons do not work ... the leading data disappears, the session is broken and the payment procedure is canceled because HTTPS / CGI)  And I have to do all this without leaving the page and not turning off the computer in order to return with this check and enter the password into the form from it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a1/8e0/ead/8a18e0eadcd1209e4209d04a54e0735e.png" alt="Additional service from Sberbank website"><br><br>  Here it is the support of international standards.  Here it is the European level of service. <br>  ‚ÄúA visa is accepted all over the world!‚Äù They say to me ... and I will say yes, but not from Sberbank. <br>  Incidentally, in Germany, this card was not accepted in any store or restaurant.  Everywhere - denial of service!  Just a transaction does not pass (Time Out and all). <br><br>  As a result, I had to throw euros into my ruble account at Alfa-Bank, with a bunch of commissions and at an unprofitable conversion rate, which resulted in almost one and a half times more expensive tickets (but this is still cheaper than a double room in a hotel and a day‚Äôs time) . <br><br>  So Sberbank cares about its customers.  So ‚ÄúAlways near‚Äù <br><br>  <b>PS</b> As can be seen from the comments, I do not seem to have reported the point.  The problem is not that you need to enter the code, but how to receive and use it.  The problem is in the interface.  Well, the qualifications of specific staff consultants. <br>  As it turned out, Sber had no spouse's phone number.  When she turned on the card, they asked her for a telephone number only for the city. <br>  It also turned out that 3DS support for processing is optional but for some reason does not work.  Sorry. <br><br>  PPS - Slime.  I do not mind, but work hard at least write a comment. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122053/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122053/</a></p>
