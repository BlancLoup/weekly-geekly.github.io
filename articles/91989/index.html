  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Quiet, quiet crawl, Haiku, on the slope of Fuji</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Already 5 years, probably, periodically I follow the development of events.  And, to tell the truth, I never believed to the end that the developers would one day bring at least something to the mind.  8 years of development is a long time, of course.  For 8 years, the same Linux from a purely geek operating system has grown into a serious corporate level of quality.  Haiku spent all this time copying the main BeOS functionality of the 2001 level.  But I will not condemn anyone for the sluggishness of the work; I have no moral right to do so. <br><br>  I suspect that even many IT professionals are not in the subject.  Therefore, I will explain briefly what I mean, at the same time I will do a small review. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Once upon a time there was the BeOS operating system (not to be confused with the BIOS).  Her story is so fascinating and complex that in a nutshell and not describe.  I'd rather at the end of the article leave you links for review.

      <em>Lyrical digression.</em>  <em>Somewhere in 2003, I put BeOS on my home computer as the main system, where it successfully worked for about six months.</em>  <em>At first it was not a fad, but a necessity.</em>  <em>Either there were problems with the screw, or with the RAM, but Windows resolutely hung at startup, Linux was yelling that it had a kernel panic.</em>  <em>I already knew about BeOS from some IT magazine, and on the attached disk it was a bonus.</em>  <em>I decided to put.</em>  <em>Once decided - set.</em>  <em>Launched.</em>  <em>I was surprised that it works.</em>  <em>And before buying a new computer, I could listen to music, watch movies, read books, communicate in IRC ... that is, I could do everything that was required of the computer in principle.</em> <br><br>  So Haiku is the open source version of BeOS.  Apparently, the fans were so excited about buying and selling their favorite product, that they decided to protect themselves and the future of the operating system simply by writing it from scratch and opening the source code.  It is now fashionable.  And since no one has ever opened the source code of the original system (patents and licenses, their mother is so), one can only imagine how hell was the work on developing an open clone of the system, having only the described API available. <br><br>  Haiku is not just another Linux distribution and not a Windows build, or even a MacOS clone.  This is an individual, self-sufficient system, POSIX-incompatible, which is typical.  The main difference from Linux is that the graphical interface is inseparable from the kernel.  In this regard, similar to the approach of Windows and MacOS.  This ensures the integrity of the system, the presence of a single, well-designed GUI and does not allow developers to disperse the writing of another bike (forgive me, Linux).  The advantages also include: <br><ul><li>  logical and well-documented API (software developers will appreciate); </li><li>  64-bit high-performance file system OpenBFS, which perfectly manifests itself in working with large amounts of data (video, for example); </li><li>  microkernel (plus itself). </li></ul><br>  The developers did not manage to lose binary compatibility with the original BeOS on the way.  Therefore, it cannot be said that there is no software for the system.  There is.  And in sufficient quantities.  Simply, it is morally obsolete, and no one is throwing a new one yet.  The fate of this ‚Äúbee system‚Äù is too complicated, investors are already scolding, and altruists programmers also want to eat. <br><br>  On September 14, 2009, the first official release of the Haiku operating system for developers (Haiku R1 / Alpha 1, the so-called) was released.  Of course, nobody expected much from the first ‚Äúalpha‚Äù.  Its release is most likely needed morally by the system developers themselves, and it is already possible to promote at exhibitions.  Strangely enough, Haiku showed itself from the good side, honestly sticking out all its advantages and skillfully hiding the flaws.  It didn‚Äôt even glitch for a few hours studying the system  The developers themselves admit that at the moment far from everything is rosy: there is still no normal support for wi-fi (coming soon, really), no application manager, no drivers for printers and nothing else.  But in any case, the work done is a matter of respect.  <a href="http://dev.haiku-os.org/wiki/FutureHaikuFeatures">Further plans</a> too.  By the way, according to <a href="http://qube.ru/news/vtoraja-alfa-uzhe-10-maja">rumors</a> , the second alpha version of Haiku will be released on May 10th.  I already thought that I would have to wait again for about 8 years, but no, the ice had broken. <br><br>  <em>In action:</em> <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oPCjFuoWhQc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg9oy2BcBUur65ipV6rdnvpHH54Gw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <em>Well, a small promo for the seed:</em> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FnjM-kaZje0&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiXedZ5oTww5No74oHN-NPJQXJQxA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Maybe I'm wrong, but the system just begs for optimization under netbooks.  There she will be comfortable.  Fast, stable, initially multimedia - what the doctor ordered.  At least it will give the necessary financial investments, which the Haiku community is so lacking now.  And there, look that, and will reach the desktop ... <br><br>  Generally - what to say?
