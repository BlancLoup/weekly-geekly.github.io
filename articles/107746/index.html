Refresher courses, if by them we mean a number of face-to-face meetings where new material is given and skills are formed, no one needs them by themselves.  Oh, in the field of IT for sure.  Who wants - the buttons and learn how to press.  The harder question is: <strong>WHY</strong> push these buttons?  And here the meaning is different - how to make a person start thinking differently, how to change his technique in some way, how to turn his view of himself and the subject.  A good course of study, in my opinion, must always encroach on the fact that ‚Äúthe tumbler should click in the head‚Äù.  He formulated it this way: ‚ÄúLearning is justified only when a student has new meanings and ideas.  Own.  Did it work for me - not for me to judge, but for the listeners ... <br><br>  But the courses are over.  Final works are defended, people disperse and ... remain white crows in their schools (more than once I heard that graduation from courses and the desire to work differently caused trouble to many).  There are those (and quite a few) who would like to continue.  But where?  as?  when?

      From the spring I planned, in September I started an initiative that will try to answer these questions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In St. Petersburg, a permanently operating Club (it can be called a seminar or a laboratory) with the code name <strong>‚ÄúPedagogical Club of Network Interaction‚Äù</strong> starts its work at the Center.  The frequency of club meetings is once a month.  What will this initiative represent? <br><br>  First, people are invited who want to work, try, think, discuss, and not just listen.  I do not have a goal to continue the courses and talk about new services and tools every month.  The club is a meeting place for like-minded people experimenting in a new, interesting area.  Therefore, active participants are necessarily invited.  I would very much like to, in the interval between the seminars, the participants try to work with these tools in their schools.  To declarative ideas become reality. <br><br>  Secondly, although the doors are open for everyone, but first of all I invite the graduates of my course <a href="http://eelmaa.blogspot.com/p/blog-page.html">‚ÄúModern Internet technologies in educational practice‚Äù</a> .  This is due solely to the fact that these meetings will not explain how to upload a picture in Picasa, where you can place a presentation, and what a tag cloud is.  I did this on the course.  Now let us, on the basis of this knowledge, practice: take out work in class, try at school, get some results, and then meet, discuss, consult and share with each other what happened and what did not.  If the teacher and without my course is guided in modern services - excellent!  Then welcome!  But I don‚Äôt want to waste time on the obvious.  There is where to go next! <br><br>  <strong>1.</strong> We will return to the studied services, more deeply consider their functionality, design new scenarios for practical use. <br>  <strong>2.</strong> We will consider new services, jointly think about using them. <br>  <strong>3.</strong> We will write about our work experience (in blogs or other convenient environment) - so that these techniques will not disappear, but become the property of our colleagues - so as not to invent the same ‚Äúbicycles‚Äù. <br>  <strong>4.</strong> We should have an in-person network community of those who are interested in working in this direction. <br><br>  Over time, we will try to bring (bring) to seminars of famous people who have a different experience, a different look.  There are some ideas, but for now I will keep silent. <br><br>  At the time of this writing, 2 meetings took place, at which Dabbleboard and Delicious services were discussed.  The work of the Club is coordinated through the <a href="http://w2edu.blogspot.com/">Club's blog</a> . <br><br>  If among the readers there are subject teachers (not necessarily informatics) who would be interested in this - welcome! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107746/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107746/</a></p>
