And with it the number of such returns ‚Äúby marriage‚Äù has increased: ‚Äúthey do not measure,‚Äù ‚Äúthey show then 33, then 38‚Äù, etc. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/513/e6a/7a1/513e6a7a1a8d4a9a86f36146f844a6ec.jpg"><br>  In fact: of all the returned "defective" thermometers, not one was broken, on the contrary: everyone worked absolutely correctly and accurately.  And, perhaps, it is appropriate to say a few words in defense. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The problem with such thermometers probably arises much more often than it seems.  Here, on Geektimes, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9%2B%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2580">quite a lot of</a> different materials are devoted to infrared thermometers, or pyrometers, and the rest of the Internet seems to be hearing about them for the first time. <br><br>  By and large, all problems arise because: <br><br><ul><li>  There is no understanding how to measure </li><li>  There is no desire to read the instructions </li><li>  No desire to change batteries </li></ul><br>  Funny, but true.  Yesterday, for example, they brought "by marriage" another B.Well worker.  If you try to reason logically, why it looks strange, then you can.  All brands associated with medicine and sold in pharmacies undergo expensive certification procedures, receive GOST stamps, and to risk in such a way as to release a deliberately bad device means ruining money and business.

      In one way or another, all of them must comply with the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_77904/">Federal Law on Uniformity of Measurement</a> ‚Äù to ensure ‚Äúthe needs of citizens, society and the state in obtaining objective, reliable and comparable measurement results used to protect the lives and health of citizens, the environment, animal and vegetable peace, defense and security of the state ". <br><br>  They are somehow regulated by the Interstate Standard " <a href="http://docs.cntd.ru/document/gost-20790-93">GOST 20790-93</a> ": INSTRUMENTS, APPARATUS AND EQUIPMENT MEDICAL.  There is also <a href="https://www.astm.org/Standards/E1965.htm">ASTM E1965</a> , dedicated to infrared thermometers and, if digging, there will be such a number of papers, documents, certificates and reporting tests and general, and for each unit separately, that "too lazy to read." <br><br>  All these documents (Example from A &amp; D <a href="http://td-str.ru/file.aspx%3Fid%3D27147">in electronic form</a> ) are obtained by developers so that the user can take a measurement in a couple of simple steps, and here again: <br><br><ul><li>  Read instructions </li><li>  Replace batteries if necessary. </li></ul><br>  For example, if B.Well WF 5000 says ‚Äúwhile holding the measurement button, slowly move the thermometer in the direction of the forehead and away from it‚Äù, this is how it should be done!  And all will be well. <br><br><h3>  How does an infrared thermometer </h3><br>  Same problem.  The network is full of questions, many doubt whether it is necessary or not.  Basically, of course, in women's forums. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d5/677/888/6d567788849d4c10be83268a9c82ceb5.png"><br><br>  Despite the fact that the best explanation can be considered an expert answer with Mail: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f8/a29/fcf/3f8a29fcf4664d5f8707c548717725f9.png"><br><br>  There are explanations and much more extensive: ‚ÄúInfrared thermometers measure the surface temperature of objects.  The device optics captures the radiated, reflected and transmitted (transmitted) energy and focuses it on the detector.  The electronics of the device gives the value of this energy and converts it into a digital value of temperature on the screen of the device.  The laser built into the device is used only for target designation. " <br><br>  Actually, as soon as it comes to this, even more questions arise immediately.  For trading on the net or in pharmacies, it would be much simpler and more logical to look something like this: ‚ÄúThe human body, like any other physical object whose temperature is different from absolute zero, is a source of infrared radiation.  The more intense the infrared radiation, the higher the temperature of the person - it is on this principle that night-vision devices work that set off the human circuit against the background of a colder environment. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  How does a specific infrared thermometer work? </h3><br>  In the overwhelming majority of cases, ‚Äúmarriage‚Äù returns are from men.  The anecdotal situation, which describes the process of referring to a man's instructions when everything is already broken, works.  This is due to the fact that in the descriptions of this type of thermometers everything is said quite generally: <br><br><ol><li>  Bring it to your body </li><li>  Click the button </li><li>  Measurements in seconds </li></ol><br>  Formally, everything is as it is.  But there are nuances.  For example, two times in a row we were returned to <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/infrakrasnyj-termometr-ftn.html">Medisana FTN</a> .  Then they managed to buy one of them even before the inspection, almost every day, and there were no complaints about it. <br><br>  One we checked.  The main problem was that "it shows the temperature immediately with a large variation of several degrees."  Here is the result: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3eEn-0R5Ffo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  This particular Medisan had to first ‚Äúcalibrate‚Äù, select the ‚Äúplace‚Äù from which the measurement would be: the forehead and the body and wait for the illumination to complete.  As a result, one problem is less. <br><br>  Yesterday - B.Well with the same problem: "from 33 to 38".  B.Well models are simpler in terms of settings.  And if everything is done <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/obzory/obzorbwellwf5000.html">correctly</a> , there will also be no big problems: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/845/88e/6e6/84588e6e6f7c48fba70fbedbf1741d92.JPG"><br><br>  In this case, it is worth saying that one of the problems associated with the minimization of error, the producers decide for themselves, even at the form level.  With B.Well, that the Medisana is arranged in such a way that in the hand they ‚Äúsit down‚Äù correctly, and the sensor is in the right direction to the forehead, exactly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0df/09e/f3b/0df09ef3bd3a4f37a412a0220ea9b7e8.JPG"><br><br><h3>  What may be general recommendations </h3><br>  First, since this is a technology, certain conditions are required for correct reproduction.  Of course, it is somewhat more difficult than putting a thermometer under the arm.  However, this should not be confusing. <br><br>  For example, recommendations for correct measurement of pressure with digital tonometers: sit quietly, preferably in a relaxed state for half an hour, are perceived normally. <br><br>  But for thermometers: do not measure directly from the street, do not sit for a long time near the battery before measuring, etc. - such advice is taken with skepticism. <br><br>  Then we must understand that the normal temperature in different parts of the body is different.  It is also, as it turns out, not everyone knows.  You can google pictures or text materials on this account: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f6/a2a/323/6f6a2a32333f4c18b7a03af477c84858.jpg"></div><br>  Also worth considering minor differences in age: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b2/698/52f/7b269852f7754206aed04290ed2043be.jpg"></div><br>  We also recommend that you <b>always change batteries</b> .  This is generally a separate conversation, and also for some reason considered to be something strange.  Like, I take a thermometer for 1000 - 3000 rubles, so also change the batteries? <br><br>  On the other hand, again a mirror example.  Say, Accu-Chek's insulin pump works correctly only with Duracell batteries.  They are much more expensive than, for example, GP.  But nothing can be done!  The average cost of <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/catalog/57948/list%3Ftext%3Daccu%2520chek%2520combo%26hid%3D1009487%26was_redir%3D1%26rs%3DeJwzUlCS4-JPTE4uVUjOSM1WSM7PTcoXOPboIbMSCweDAKcGAwCnuAk-%26glfilter%3D7893318%253A10745037%26deliveryincluded%3D0%26onstock%3D1">Accu-Chek is about 100,000 rubles</a> .  Nothing is tolerated. <br><br>  How correct is it to compare and on what does a person‚Äôs life depend?  From the correct operation of the infrared thermometer or from the correct operation of the insulin pump?  - Ethical issues. <br><br><h3>  No batteries </h3><br>  It would be strange to assume that in the category of "smart electronics" connected to a smartphone, no one will offer anything.  There is a thermometer that does not need to be charged - <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/266528/">Croise.A</a> .  He has a FDA mark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f24/938/544/f24938544a524209849e058ccebfd3b0.JPG"><br><br>  It may seem inconvenient when measuring the temperature on yourself: the thermometer is connected to Jack, you need to bring it to your forehead and press a button in the application.  However, to measure objects or the temperature of another person - he is fit. <br><br><h3>  Price </h3><br>  Another factor that is likely to be the reason for the return.  A mercury thermometer stands at ‚ÄúPharmacy 36.6‚Äù 120 rubles.  Infrared - on average - from 1000. We measure the temperature not so often, and it seems that such a thermometer is needed just to quickly measure a small child.  Do I have to overpay? <br><br><h3>  Accuracy </h3><br>  I don‚Äôt know how successful our attempts to stand up and ‚Äúrehabilitate‚Äù are, but the arguments are correct, but for the entire time of testing there has not been a single marriage.  Anyway, we test all returns before sending to the manufacturer, but then we were lucky. <br><br>  If there is a real marriage - then, of course, everything is according to the laws / guarantees, etc. Exchange, refund and other procedures, but so far, apparently, claims have arisen for some other reason, some of which we tried to find. <br><br>  So if you had a thought, on whether to buy or not.  Exactly / not exactly.  Problem / not problem.  With the infrared thermometers of famous brands that can be bought at the pharmacy, in most cases everything is in order, and there should be no problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/401655/">https://habr.com/ru/post/401655/</a></p>
