Of course, it is difficult to interview each of the nearly 2 million people who viewed it to find out the impressions, but we spoke with some drivers.  Let's try to figure out how ZUS is a good alternative to car charging: the pros and cons inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bd/897/f37/9bd897f37c514a06a5f3391117890b44.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general terms: <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/zus-car-charge.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dzus%26utm_campaign%3Dzus">Zus Car Charger</a> is a smart car charger that <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/zus-car-charge.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dzus%26utm_campaign%3Dzus">locates a</a> car and allows you to charge devices twice as fast as standard ones.

      A little bit about the video.  Frames show us a moderately confused person who cannot find his car.  This does sometimes happen, and I found myself in a similar situation in the covered parking lot of a shopping center. <br><br>  This, for example, is not excluded when you arrived first, and then around how all your cars will be shown.  Or, let's say, there is no one identifying column, you seem to remember the cars standing nearby, and then they will disperse as new ones, and new ones will stand on the vacant places, and you are looking for it.  Stupid situation.  You walk, you look, you look around, as if you are plotting something evil. <br><br>  "Our parking", the one from the video looks just so scary.  Also removed from the top for intimidation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/69d/77d/f7b/69d77df7bca44c45bb96c140fa00eabb.jpg"><br><br>  However, there are not so many parking lots in our city. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">However, in the near Moscow region one managed to find one</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a00/b05/24e/a00b0524eeb0477ab88be63d4fa9a98e.JPG"><br><br>  It's pretty crowded on weekends.  All the space that is now empty, filled. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ce/076/55e/0ce07655e78343c6bd95ad4bb053e04b.JPG"><br><br>  The area, though not very large, but you can get lost. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d93/71c/d64/d9371cd64d1543e2bb2edeb12e9102c8.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e85/ad0/191/e85ad019128048698666c0c41fe1b61f.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d55/704/1f7/d557041f7c0d4634a4f0287bb746de94.JPG"><br></div></div><br>  Basically, a large cluster of cars at shopping centers "hiding" in closed areas.  And here, as if to put it mildly, there is a nuance: in the closed parking at the shopping center - ZUS will not help you.  The smartphone does not determine the exact location in confined spaces due to a weak satellite signal.  However, this information is honestly marked on the official website under the asterisk. <br><br>  When I talked to other drivers, it also turned out that there are other life hacking, much simpler ones, to quickly return to my car.  The most obvious thing is to try to always park in the same place plus / minus.  Photograph the approximate location. <br><br>  Good.  All of our parking is not very large, viewed and easy to navigate.  But if such a moment happens: you and your wife are going to the same place, but some of you are traveling by public transport, some by car. <br><br>  Parking is open, but a certain number of cars are already there and by phone you can‚Äôt explain where you are standing.  In this case, ZUS may be useful.  In the settings of the application, you can share the data to any email. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b07/afd/926/b07afd926c22419db26312b4f4eb03b0.jpg"><br><br>  This facilitates the search for a parked car by a person who was not present when parking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e74/346/985/e743469850c14016a2492b07599894dc.jpg"><br><br>  <b>ZUS and paid parking</b> <br><br>  The function of notifications can be curious and useful.  Almost the entire center is paid parking, but you can ‚Äúzaglyatsya‚Äù.  Go to the store and forget, not in time to look at the clock.  Well, the center is not a very suitable example, because the application through which you pay for parking "pushes". <br><br>  But there are a number of shopping centers, train stations, where no one will send a kind reminder, and when the free limit expires, the counter starts.  So in a shopping center, for example, where ZUS initially seemed completely useless, it will come in handy as an ‚Äúalarm clock‚Äù that will remind you to return to the car in time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1f/79e/de1/f1f79ede122c4d239f18b82ccb9b7869.jpg"><br><br>  This feature is very convenient to configure: right in the main menu. <br><br>  <b>ZUS in the cabin</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2da/48d/26f/2da48d26f8f948d68499cd16cc0d41a0.JPG"><br><br>  The design is thought out in such a way that, firstly, you can not stick looking USB-cable.  The connector is two-way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2f/c83/c36/f2fc83c36f084be89641dcae31a84a81.JPG"><br><br>  It is convenient on the road, so as not to be distracted if you are the driver.  Outlets are located on the sides, so that in the case of charging smartphones, driver and passenger, the wire goes towards the owner. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/693/670/8dd/6936708ddfe64dd594c27b21b0ad4ae8.JPG"><br><br>  The design also simplifies the process of connecting the wires compared to charging, where both outputs are closely ‚Äúpressed‚Äù to each other. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06f/8b1/248/06f8b1248e8042a4b8eb36bc7fa391be.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, here it is appropriate to say that, despite the design award, and the special positioning of the structure from this point of view, the device is not scratch resistant.  On the one hand, who sees him!  On the other - nothing, but not nice. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ef/815/223/8ef81522317c4e61b9e0da53d200ba31.JPG"><br><br>  Or so.  On the other hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d97/e20/ee5/d97e20ee58dd4bc5a0778454664de5d2.JPG"><br><br>  <b>ZUS and fast charge</b> <br><br>  The promo materials of the first version, and we are still talking about the first version, are emphatically oriented towards the owners of the iPhone.  That's because charging that supports Qualcomm Quick Charge <a href="https://www.nonda.co/products/zus-qc-smart-car-charger">appeared a</a> little later (and, by the way, costs a little more). <br><br>  The standard first version provides accelerated charging of Apple devices, as follows from the information on the official website. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/90b/2ba/101/90b2ba101f04429c9c72705db9b4070f.png"><br><br>  It is difficult to say whether this is a decisive factor or not, given that Android smartphones, of course, are currently more widespread in the world and in Russia.  ZUS gives 6 Iphone 16% in 15 minutes. <br><br>  <b>Will Android charge faster?</b> <br><br>  Will be.  All the same: about 1% per minute. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How many issues</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ada/8ff/6e3/ada8ff6e37f04e25b91615de48234006.jpg"><br></div></div><br>  Despite the quite impressive results ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a5/6b6/d7d/7a56b6d7d2294c3a9169bc06ff39b5fc.jpg"><br><br>  There is also a feature: in a pair of Android-Iphone at the same time, some of the magical properties are lost, or rather it only applies to Android: Iphone starts charging as usual: that is, slowly. <br><br>  <b>What else?</b> <br><br>  In one of the sections of the menu, you can learn about the status of the battery. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebb/e04/6ce/ebbe046ce7b440178c220821f6313ef9.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Eventually</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/zus-car-charge.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeek%26utm_medium%3Dzus%26utm_campaign%3Dzus">ZUS</a> is a much more functional device than it seems at first.  Some of the opportunities inherent in it seem rarely claimed, but always - on all will of chance.  The device looks very concise, attractive.  The direction of the wires towards the owner of the rechargeable device minimizes the bends, which are often detrimental to ordinary inexpensive cables. <br><br>  If you forgot to charge your smartphone, then for a short period of time on a trip, you can ‚Äúreanimate‚Äù it until you connect to the network.  Also to help - tracking car battery. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403173/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403173/</a></p>
