What has changed in 10 years?  The golden triangle has disappeared;  users almost twice as fast began to scan pages;  almost one and a half times more often they began to click on links located in 2-4 places on the results page.  Here you can <a href="http://pages.mediative.com/SERP-Research">download a detailed study</a> . <br><br>  Ruslan Kryuchkov from UsabilityLab tells the story: <a href="http://www.mediative.com/research/golden-triangle">For the first time, the golden triangle on the SERP was opened in 2005 using eye-tracking</a> (then this company was called Enquiro).  A year later, a comparative study was conducted on several search engines (Google, Yahoo !, MSN).  In Russia, Dmitry Satin, Ruslan Kryuchkov, Evgeny Kulakov, Tatyana Kravchuk and Maria Rybakova-Kuznetsova <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/dmitry.satin/ss-14190971">confirmed this phenomenon on domestic search engines in 2009</a> .  The study was also conducted on 50 users.  There are many questions to the study design and conclusions, but the triangle is the result in which we are more confident than others.  It is interesting now to see that the golden triangle has turned into another pattern.  So I understand the main reasons for this: 1) The structure of the SERP is changing (there used to be a more or less homogeneous set of links, and now there are different inserts from the witches);  2) The perceptions of users on the SERP page are changing. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://the-pastry-box-project.net/anne-gibson/2014-july-31">An Alphabet of Accessibility Issues</a></strong> <br>  Alphabet health problems affecting the work with the interface.

This is a new application platform, with which many of us will have to work in the coming years.  In this thread will be collected material on the design and design of interfaces for them. <br><br>  In one device, a significant number of cases of using watches and bracelets are collected in all four key areas - notifications, medicine / sports, authorization (payment, entrance to hotels), controller (remote control for TV control).  And all this with a very careful understanding of the fact that the watch is an important accessory tied to the fashion industry (an <a href="http://www.hodinkee.com/blog/hodinkee-apple-watch-review">interesting analysis from the browser of a classic watch</a> ).  True, a category redefinition was expected from the announcement, as it happened earlier with the player, phone and tablet, but it turned out to be just the most systematic solution on the market.  Which, moreover, fixed the basic understanding of the role of such devices - a more or less rigid appendage to a smartphone (and without cross-platform yet). <br><br>  There are many interesting interface solutions - a zoom-panned start-up screen with an unusual arrangement of application icons;  The second coming click wheel in the form of the winding head of the winding mechanism for replacing part of touch gestures (easier to get on the small screen, the interface does not overlap with a finger).  It's funny that the skeorphism returned in the form of three-dimensional emoticons, achivok and other trifles.  The density of information in the interface rolls over, which is quite strongly contrasted with the lighter approach of Android Wear (two comparisons from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/apple/2014/09/smartwatch-wars-the-apple-watch-versus-android-wear-in-screenshots/">ArsTechnica</a> and <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6129023/apple-designed-a-custom-typeface-for-the-apple-watch-just-like-google-did-for-android">The Verge</a> ).  But the overall message is different - if Google has a more accessible screen for viewing notifications, then Apple has a mini-smart phone with a wealth of features. <br><br>  There are no official guidelines yet, but templates for designers are already emerging.  A separate font was created for the watch, somewhat reminiscent of Din and Roboto ( <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/9/6126953/apple-watch-smartwatch-comparison-android-wear-pebble/in/5895078">The Verge</a> and <a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/3035548/fast-feed/what-the-font-analyzing-the-new-apple-watch-typeface">Fast Co Design</a> ), but there is no specifics about it either.  The clock will be produced in two sizes, but nothing is said about the screen resolution again ( <a href="http://www.joshworth.com/whats-the-apple-watch-screen-resolution/">Josh Worth is trying to calculate it</a> ).  Information should appear closer to the output of the device at the beginning of next year. <br><br>  On the official site a lot of photos and videos.

Such a platform solves several tasks at once: <br><ol><li>  Guaranteed design unification.  The product development and update method uses a single code base, which stores once created and tested interface patterns. </li><li>  Scaling improvements.  Having finished the pattern in one of the projects (for example, by increasing the depth of viewing in the news block on the topic), you can quickly distribute it to the others and increase the product efficiency of the entire service line. </li><li>  Constant relevance of design.  Avoiding heroic products every few years to regular hygiene.  The restarts take a lot of energy and lose thousands of small developments bolted to the product over a long time of its development. </li><li>  Less routine for the designer, more focus on food tasks.
