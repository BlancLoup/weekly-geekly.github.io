Go to <a href="http://papeeria.com/">papeeria.com</a> . <br><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  If you are a student, then you probably already write a term paper or a diploma, or seriously think about it.  If you also study in a technical college and in your work a lot of formulas and other non-text, then you may think about what to write it in - in LibreOffice / Word or in LaTeX.  And it is possible that the only thing that stops you from using LaTeX is that the Word is right there, take it and write, and you should still install the latex, mess around with the almost inevitable pitfalls and then look at the white sheet and stupidly think where to start.  Here we also want to help you.  And also to those who want to conduct their scientific work from any place where there is Internet. <br><br>  For everyone else: if you don‚Äôt even know what a patch is, we recommend google (you can start, for example, <a href="http://www.opennet.ru/docs/RUS/linux_base/node380.html">from here</a> ).  If you know something and just want to poke around on the topic of latex vs word, then look for yourself, please, another field.  We will be very grateful.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Briefly about the team: two people are actively engaged in the development, we are both from the Faculty of Mathematics and Mechanics of St. Petersburg State University, which we use as a testing ground. <br><br><h4>  What we already have </h4><br>  In general, we are doing a kind of cloud-based IDE for scientific work (see details in the next section).  But since in the scientific work the main result is the text of the article or diploma, we started with the LaTeX editor.  Here is a picture for you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/115/a55/6cc/115a556ccf8581f56c1514aad3f4d519.png"><br><br><h5>  Online editor </h5><br>  No need to download the TeX distribution and configure it.  Go to <a href="http://papeeria.com/">papeeria.com</a> from your favorite browser (we recommend Chrome or Firefox), sign up with a Google or Vkontakte account, look at the demo document, and then type and compile your own hello world. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hi LaTeX Template</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code class="tex hljs"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">\</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">documentclass</span></span></span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">{article}</span></span></span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">\</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">usepackage</span></span></span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">{fontspec}</span></span></span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">\</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">setmainfont</span></span></span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">{CMU Serif}</span></span></span></span> <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">\</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">begin</span></span></span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">{document}</span></span></span></span>  <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">\</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">LaTeX</span></span></span></span>! <span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-tag">\</span><span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-name">end</span></span></span><span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-tag"><span class="hljs-string">{document}</span></span></span></span></code> </pre> <br></div></div><br><br>  We support XeTeX and PDFLaTeX.  Pictures, bibtex, tikz, beamer, listings, it all works. <br><br><h5>  PDF viewer and error navigation </h5><br>  The result of the compilation is usually a PDF document, and if it turned out, then we will try to show it to you next to your source text.  If any compilation errors have occurred, we will analyze the error log, show you the readable messages in the error panel and the link will lead you from the message to the line in which the error was detected. <br><br><h5>  Templates </h5><br>  For those who are afraid of a clean slate, we have several templates of full-fledged documents.  There is a template of diploma / term paper on the requirements of St. Petersburg State University mathematics and mathematics, with formulas, pictures and a list of references.  There is a beamer presentation template.  There is a resume template approved by the best HRs of St. Petersburg :) <br><br><h5>  Teamwork </h5><br>  Few people write articles alone.  The supervisor sometimes wants to look at the text and make comments; you may want to ask someone to do a proof reading, and finally, you may just have several co-authors.  It would be great if you could edit the text together in the same way as in Google Docs, but so far we have no such possibility.  But there is an opportunity to give access to "reading and compiling", and at least your colleagues will be able to see your text and give you their comments. <br><br><h5>  Import and export projects </h5><br>  We do not tie you to the cloud.  You can at any time download your project as a ZIP archive and work on it offline.  You can, on the contrary, post a ZIP with an existing project and continue working on it in the cloud. <br><br><h4>  How much does it cost and can you trust it </h4><br>  Everything that we have at the moment is provided and will be provided free of charge.  We, of course, are not good fairies with a bag of gold.  The compilation costs money, and we will make paid services, but the basic functionality sufficient for writing a diploma will remain free. <br><br>  The service opened in February, and since then we have got dozens of users who are gaining coursework and diplomas from us, and as far as we know, they are satisfied.  A couple of times there were failures corrected quickly and without loss of data.  However, Papiria is formally in the alpha version stage, so adventures are possible.  We, however, will do everything so that they are not there. <br><br>  We ourselves actively use our product: the programmer # 0 does the beamer-presentations for his lectures, and the programmer # 1 gathers his thesis. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">How does the presentation in LaTeX</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/17138587&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjmVWQH1UF4btoo-vZpmBa38HIS9w" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br></div></div><br>  Let me remind you also that we do not bind to the service.  Trust us or not - decide for yourself. <br><br><h4>  Our competitors and our plans </h4><br>  We have competitors and we are not afraid to talk about them.  First of all, it is <a href="http://sharelatex.com/">sharelatex.com</a> and <a href="http://writelatex.com/">writelatex.com</a> .  These are sturdy and interesting products that were born much earlier than Papiria, and their functionality is richer in places. <br><br>  We compete with them in the area of ‚Äã‚ÄãLaTeX typesetting, but our plans go further.  Our dream is to transfer to online everything that is connected with scientific work, and this is not just a text.  This is plotting the results of experiments (what gnuplot, matlab, R, or even Excel is doing now).  This is the work of assessors to assess the results obtained (was the image in this picture recognized correctly, is this really a human head, not a dog's head?).  This is the launch of the actual experimental calculations, especially over big data.  This is an automatic search for relevant research and conferences.  Perhaps something else that we do not yet know about. <br><br><h4>  Our contacts </h4><br>  On Twitter, the latest news and announcements about packs: <a href="http://twitter.com/papeeria">twitter.com/papeeria</a> <br>  In Google+, the news in more detail and with pictures: <a href="https://plus.google.com/114845278978846632632/posts">plus.google.com/114845278978846632632/posts</a> <br>  In the interface of the Papyria, the Feedback button dangles, through it you can report a bug or suggest an idea. <br>  You can write to papeeria-feedback@bardsoftware.com, but as long as the discussion does not fall into the discussion of very few interesting particulars, we prefer to keep it open. <br><br>  Have fun, use, tell us about problems or vice versa, about achievements.  It is important for us to know about both the one and the other. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179021/</a></p>
