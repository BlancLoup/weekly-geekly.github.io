  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Back to the Opera?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I started using opera when nobody knew about firefox. <br>  After IE, it certainly was a fairy tale. <br>  Tabs, search, crazy customization - customize as you want, and the download speed ... drop out ... <br>  I became a fan of Opera.  I registered on all its Russian-speaking sites and forums. <br>  Followed all updates.  Well, in general, everything is as usual. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sometimes some sites were displayed incorrectly in it ... but this was rare.  (BUT WAS‚Ä¶ sediment remains) <br>  Then I faced the problem of integrating Regeta ... but I found the plugin ... (but the sediment remained) <br>  Then he found DownloaderMaster - who made friends with Opera and easily forgot about reget and sediment. <br><br>  A few years passed ... people started talking about Fox.  "Superbrowser" "Cool and simple" "A lot of opportunities" and all that ... <br>  I did not even look at him.  Well that could be compared with my "charm." <br>  Then I tried to use the M2 opera mail client.  At that time I used The BAT and honestly said it was not very satisfied.  This is slow archiving (I didn‚Äôt understand what it is for).  And I got work with IMAP. <br>  Overdrive on M2 and was amazed at the speed.  This is just a Ferrari from email clients.  And with IMAP there is no equal at all.  I really liked their filter system, it just had to be understood.  Vobschem joy nebylo limit. <br>  People kept talking about firefox.  I was up to the bulb ... <br>  Winter has come ... (joke) <br><br>  As work progressed, it became necessary to correctly organize all contacts.  First hit.  This is an address book in M2.  Horror.  The scarcity just disappointed.  I was desperate. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

      Put Outluk.  Principle all competently.  But to wrest the hands of programmers from Microsoft for such an organization of settings.  The speed of working with IMAP also left something to be desired. <br>  And yet I could not get rid of some strange feeling while working with Outluk ... I don‚Äôt even know how to describe it.  It was not that lightness chtoli.  Like a stone around his neck wore. <br><br>  Spring came.  It's time for blogs and startups ... as well as fast and comfortable web surfing. <br>  New releases of the opera all pleased and delighted. <br><br>  And here.  My very good friend (he, like me, is a software man - there is such a disease, and also ‚Äúsat‚Äù on the opera) says to me: <br>  - Put firefox! .. <br>  -- What for?!  - I say to him. <br>  ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a ScrapBook,‚Äù he says. <br>  I quickly looked at the forums that this beast is a ScrapBook.  Put yourself an Obook.  And continued light surfing. <br>  But, the fact that my friend put Fox, I was restless. <br>  And I did it.  Download it.  And installed. <br>  Launched.  Opened Yandex.  Pretty quick.  Jumped on the tabs.  It seems all sdorovo.  Captivatingly simple interface.  Climbed into the settings.  Everything is neatly laid out.  Even more beautiful than the opera. <br>  I wanted to customize it. <br>  And so.  Some poor set of buttons.  And the most important thing!  I can't do the tabs below.  Horror.  My hand immediately reached for uninstall - the thunderstorm of all programs.  But something stopped me. <br><br>  I returned to the opera and continued surfing. <br>  Summer has come. <br>  I meet a friend of software. <br>  -- Hello.  He says.  ‚ÄúAnd you know that all the power of firefox in plugins ...‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúYes, but ...‚Äù <br>  ‚ÄúTry it ...‚Äù he said and left. <br><br>  I went to the firefox plugin forum.  And I could not get away from there. <br>  There was all that I lacked. <br>  Indeed, all the power of firefox in its extensions.  But I want to note that this is his weakness. <br>  On the Mozilla website, I succumbed to advertising and put Thunderbird. <br><br>  After Autluk, of course, breathing became easier.  Pleased with the work with IMAP.  (but up to M2, of course he could not keep up).  Most of all I liked the interface.  Clean and tidy. <br><br>  But talking about firefox. <br>  Over time, I began to notice that this browser is loading slowly. <br>  Some extensions clashed with each other.  And lately, in general, he began to take off.  What in general is unacceptable for me. <br>  Of course, the reason for all this is one, this is a bunch of extensions. <br>  I remembered the opera.  But as a drug addict, I was broken ... the extensions captivated me.  and how easy it is to manage them. <br>  I chose for myself the most useful and necessary.  Others derailed. <br>  But the sediment remained ... :-) <br>  Of course, on the machine I have all the golden three browsers. <br>  But I'm surfing Fox. <br><br>  And here I am again at a crossroads. <br>  Return to my opera or not ... <br>  (ScrapBook, by the way, swelled badly, a good thing.) <br>  What I lack in Fox is a basket of closed tabs. <br>  And the fact that, when restoring a session, he begins to reload all the pages again.  When a lot of them are very annoying. <br><br>  What advise friends? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15465/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15465/</a></p>
