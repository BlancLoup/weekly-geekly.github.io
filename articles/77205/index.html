    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Overall impression </h4><br>  1) Services are not provided in full, but how it comes to the subscription fee comes as soon as you sms with the information that you need to pay !!!  WHERE the promised 10 megabits ???  Dear Yota, you do not care if I have the money to pay?  so why should I care that you have problems with the equipment, etc.  I paid so be kind to me to provide services in full for which I paid !!!  St. Petersburg, Primorsky District.  (-ten) <br><br>  2) Disgusting quality of communication.  With excellent signal quality, the access speed does not exceed 70K and drops every day.  Territorially - Tulskaya metro station.  HTC Max 4g.  (-five) <br><br>  3) The overall impression rather in the red.  First of all, sometimes the torrent is loaded at speeds up to megabits, but more often between 128-512 kbps.  Constant communication breaks, while IotaAkses shows that it works, but does not load anything, lasts up to five minutes, then the connection appears again.  Ping ... It‚Äôs impossible to play a single online game, KCC, Code, yes, you can easily forget anything, otherwise your nerves will become just none ... Technical support calls yielded nothing, except for standard statements ‚Äúblah blah blah blabla , we kick engineers, forgive us, for God's sake. ‚Äù  Although no, a miracle happened once, and after the call, the Internet began to work at 4-5 megabits.  But the happiness lasted exactly four days.  (-five) <br><br>  4) At the end, a real provider appeared in Krasnodar that would force local providers to move and begin to provide a quality service.  (+5) <br><br>  5) it is clear that the company is developing, not standing still.  For those who are behind the Ring Road and the Moscow Ring Road, a real competitor to local providers, forcing them to reduce tariffs.  (+5) <br><br>  6) a strange testing policy ... unless it was impossible to carry out the simplest logical calculation for the fact that people would rush to an iota under the ‚Äúyoke‚Äù of yuk ... unprepared (-1) <br><br>  7) Excellent PR, excellent presentation of the company !!!  (+5) <br><br>  8) Krasnodar.  The impression is extremely positive.  Let while small problems with speed with communication but the test for that and the test.  (+10) <br><br>  9) Finally, the real alternative in the city of Sochi.  The speed in most cases up to "indecency" is high (personally tested up to 8 Mbit / s).  Unlimited tariff plans at such speeds and mobility: a huge step forward for the Sochi market - other providers have something to think about ... (+10) <br><br>  10) in 5 years they will kill most of the smaller wires and turn them into a ‚Äúhome phone‚Äù (+5) <br><br>  11) It is very unpleasant ... hooked on this miracle at the very beginning of its appearance.  I was pleased and pleased (speed, price and quality, coverage of Moscow).  Now the speed has completely fallen ... you often have to go back to streaming.  (Now, IMHO, the price does not match the quality) ... Looks like this attitude towards customers ... first we will lure beauty, and then we'll spit it.  (-five) <br><br>  12) Peter.  The coating is very striped, the signal level at a distance of half a meter can be very different.  Decent speed, but apparently depends on the position of the stars in the sky.  It works idiotically - at a signal level of 12 dB (2 ‚Äústicks‚Äù) it can disconnect and start connecting again.  And very often!  maximum hour is stable, then falls off.  On average, it turns off every 5-20 minutes.  I regret that I bought.  (-five) <br><br>  13) the quality of communication has not improved since spring; max speed 1.5 Mbit / s (-5) <br><br>  14) ALL COOL !!!  I wish the rest patience and patience again!  Announced a free test, money is not taken from us.  Krasnodar!  The second day of the test is normal flight.  (+10) <br><br>  15) This is a miracle!  By air - everywhere, as before by wire.  And I still remember the days of the dylap;  All of your problems with downloading stations are now so fucking awesome when compared to a hundred other attempts to simply go online through a modem pool.  (+10) <br><br><h4>  Coverage area </h4><br>  16) Coverage improvements are constantly visible.  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãdoesn't count - that's another matter.  (+10) <br><br>  17) Does not catch either at work on Krasnobogatyrskaya or at home on a running passage. For an idea (-1) <br><br>  18) Unsatisfactory even for the city, it is generally better not to talk about the region (-10) <br><br>  19) Catching almost wherever I needed.  But in the place where I constantly need the Internet (Energeticheskaya Street, 10) it does not matter that it catches.  this significantly reduces the impression (1) <br><br>  20) Weak signal, would include the BS which is closer to me, and when they turn on they do not know (1) <br><br>  21) low-power bski.  Nearby stands, and the signal is bad.  On the outskirts of Krasnodar there is finally no signal (-10) <br><br>  22) I live on YuMR directly between 2 BS, if one of them has a bad connection, I go to another room =) (+10) <br><br>  23) The boundary of the coverage area approached my house at 500 m (and earlier it caught only at a department store at 850m).  I think in a week I will see it - interent!  (+10) <br><br>  24) all the same so far, the coverage is bad, but in my region of Russia and 40 Years of Victory I don‚Äôt catch anything at all, but we will expect everything to be fine, so a small minus (-1) <br><br>  25) The coverage leaves much to be desired - let's hope that the first step is the hardest (Sochi).  We are waiting for the start of commercial operation.  (+5) <br><br>  26) Krasnodar.  In most places where I am signal quality is either average or good.  I work without antennas.  Everything suits me.  I would like a more equal coverage in the city and coverage on the edge, I hope it will be.  (+10) <br><br>  27) unexplained anomalous stains in the coverage area ... in my house chtoli produce uranium ... the whole area is flooded, but my "little house" has not touched, I don‚Äôt buy iota before turning on the bs next to it.  (-five) <br><br><h4>  Signal quality </h4><br>  28) I am in a confident coverage area (according to the coverage map) 40 Years of Victory 35/2 (windows face north) But the signal level is minimal.  (-five) <br><br>  29) Disgusting, literally suppressed everyone and everywhere.  The feeling is that on the street the wind blows the signal, and indoors it falls powerlessly hitting the window.  (+1) <br><br>  30) usually 2-3 divisions.  most importantly, do not sit in the basement (+5) <br><br>  31) just great "quality of communication" ... "excellent" with 11% packet loss ... and in the contract there are no real figures about the standards and requirements for the technical characteristics of the Internet (-10) <br><br>  32) speed jumps very much.  All month the speed did not rise above 2 Mbps.  (-five) <br><br>  33) I live in Krasnodar on the Chekists House on the opposite on which the Base station stands a signal sure and the speed always floats a maximum of 3.2Mbps (+5) <br><br>  34) Krasnodar.  In most places where I am signal quality is either average or good.  I work without antennas.  (+10) <br><br>  35) In general, it is good, but the coverage is not complete yet (Sochi).  Commercial operation has not yet begun - advancing +5.  (+5) <br><br>  36) In Krasnodar, not everywhere good catches!  In Mr. Pashkovsky, the signal level is poor or average.  (-one) <br><br>  37) Why is it a different quality when working in one place on a USB modem and built-in intel (+5) <br><br>  38) catches.  If here about it.  But for some reason lately it has often become disrupted (+1) <br><br>  39) with excellent signal reception, the speed does not exceed 1 Mbit (-10) <br><br><h4>  Work speed </h4><br>  40) The capacity of the channel has fallen sharply about the stated speeds, we are no longer talking.  Apparently went a sharp increase in clientele.  Then I think it will be even worse.  (-five) <br><br>  41) Download speed at best 15 kilobytes per second.  (-five) <br><br>  42) Sometimes happy, an hour, a maximum of five, then again becomes a modem.  So old, 56K (-5) <br><br>  43) Krasnodar.  Let while small problems with speed, but a test for that and the test.  For surfing, 1Mbit / s is enough, but I hope that the restriction will be removed.  (+10) <br><br>  44) 30kbs not exactly what I expected (-10) <br><br>  45) Compared to other providers, the city of Sochi is a clear leadership (taking into account tariff plans).  Let's see what happens when the network really loads.  (+10) <br><br>  46) 3 sticks.  The network time is 12 hours and 10 minutes, the maximum speed per session is 0.8 Mbit.  sad (((-5) <br><br>  47) The jump is very decent for my rural area, but only 5 kilobytes for return!  This is very small (+5) <br><br>  49) Oh.  I expected honestly much more.  The average speed in the places of my greatest use is above 100Kb / s.  at rush hour and even lower.  Rarely rises to 300Kb / s.  Energy 10 and Brick 33/5 (-5) <br><br>  50) 5 mbps, wherever you go.  UTK phtopku.  (+5) <br><br>  51) At first, with good coverage, there was a bad speed, but after a week everything works fast.  Yota is fixed!  (+5) <br><br><h4>  Technical support </h4><br>  52) They explained very clearly how to join the testing of the Yota network in Sochi (+5) <br><br>  53) nowhere could I find information about QoS, if it exists at all, then it would be nice to tell users about it (-5) <br><br>  54) Twice I applied to support, the first time after a long (more than 2 days) crediting of funds to the account - I received the answer that the problem is connected with a large amount of information being processed, and at the bottom of the ad ‚Äúthis message is generated automatically.  The second time was addressed due to the lack of communication with the signal quality ‚Äúbad‚Äù - ‚Äúaverage‚Äù, and there were no such problems before, the answer was that the specified signal quality means nothing, the signal level should be 10dB.  Conclusion: BAD!  and nail them in the lid.  (-ten) <br><br>  55) Moscow, I use 1 day.  I can not replenish the account with the tariff Day.  The instructions do not coincide with the appearance of your personal account.  Call by phone - automatic answer to pre-set questions.  A letter to the support service - a response within 5 days.  After 3 hours, the paid Internet will end - and what to do?  (-five) <br><br>  56) I called twice, and besides the long wait on the handset, there are no complaints.  Regular technical support.  (+1) <br><br>  57) I called them on the phone, and the girl operator says to me: - I'm sorry, but I can't connect you from those.  support.  (-five) <br><br>  58) Explained on the phone how to connect Yota on the MacBookPro quickly and without any problems!  Thank!  (+10) <br><br>  59) This is moral support, not technical.  Terms of launching a BS at OSCAR are not even approximately given.  (-five) <br><br>  60) I sometimes get the feeling that some students work there, who themselves have just begun to understand networks.  No offense.  I hope in the future everything will change, but now everything does not matter.  (-five) <br><br>  61) They answer for a very long time, messages in LiveJournal ignore when they are uncomfortable to answer, and when they call to the TP on the phone.  8-800 ... the girl did not help anything, although the question was clear - when you activate the modem, almost a day has passed since the application was submitted.  In response, wait and everything.  (-five) <br><br>  62) There is probably no technical support, at first there was an autoinformer with the words ‚ÄúSorry, technical works are now underway in Moscow and the Moscow region, sorry for the inconvenience‚Äù and so on and put the phone down.  This was observed for 2 months.  Now just do not get through to them !!!  (-ten) <br><br>  63) The answer is technical support - we know, we work, only 2 months has passed, and it's still there ... (-10) <br><br><h4>  Tariff Policy </h4><br>  64) is very expensive because you could buy a beeline and pay much less (-10) <br><br>  65) 900 rubles a little expensive for a speed of 5 megabits, which can be seen only closer to the morning ... (+1) <br><br>  66) in the absence of speed, there is nothing to pay for.  (-one) <br><br>  67) Despite the complexity of activation - Yota day, this is a concern for the huge number of people who need an Internet occasionally.  (+10) <br><br>  68) Mobility is an advantage worth the extra cost.  Therefore, the price of 900 rubles / month.  absolutely acceptable.  But!  Again - the declared speed is different from the actual.  (+5) <br><br>  69) I want to download torrents.  For this I do not mind the 900 rubles.  in months  And if the torrents are not downloaded, then a) this is no longer unlimited (!) B) for everything else (mail, ICQ, forums) 900 rubles.  in months  it is expensive!  (-five) <br><br>  70) to pay only for an Internet radio 900 r is insanity, provided that neither play, watch streaming video, nor shake normally does not work.  A good radio listens completely free of charge from a regular receiver.  (-ten) <br><br>  71) It is not clear why at the ‚Äú50 r per day‚Äù tariff it‚Äôs not possible to stretch funds for a while. For example, having paid for 10 days, I can use them not one after the other, but when it is more convenient for me.  (+1) <br><br>  72) With the quality that now - very expensive.  But unfortunately, it is now better than the beeline modems. <br>  Although like the presence of the tariff for one day.  50 rubles on the Internet during the day on your laptop is very convenient.  No need to look for any Internet cafes, where just an hour is much more expensive (-1) <br><br><h4>  Customer focus </h4><br>  73) The company has just started its work and already indifferent attitude towards customers ... (-5) <br><br>  74) attentive service, there was a problem with the whistle, changed without problems (+5) <br><br>  75) Well, here you definitely need to wait for the maximum coverage of the city, but everyone wants to become a yota subscriber?  because they are satisfied with the prices and type of communication, and so on.  (+5) <br><br>  76) I think that in our market of telematics services everywhere such an attitude towards the client - and basically even worse (+10) <br><br>  77) Interest-free payments in terminals and ATMs!  (+5) <br><br>  78) has not yet felt.  Representing a construction company, I would like to know about the possibility of installing a WiMAX base station near the construction site in order to receive a better signal.  (-one) <br><br>  79) in principle, their policy is reasonable, as long as they fight not for quality but for space (+5) <br><br>  80) Orientation?  I think it should consist in improving the service, and not in posters all over the city ... (-1) <br><br><h4>  Line of devices </h4><br>  81) I just need a whistle.  and I look at the site - there are eggs, routers, and a phone ... (+5) <br><br>  82) Enough for comfortable use!  (+10) <br><br>  83) is quite enough in my device.  as far as I remember, the lack of devices in the PCMCI form factor is dictated by the fact that the majority of laptop users simply do not know about this slot ... (+10) <br><br>  84) I ask you to release a premium-class modem with protection against overheating, otherwise Chinese samsung, at times, can serve as an immersion heater.  I also ask for a portable modem for Iphone - by releasing such a thing you will immediately go to the international market)) (+1) <br><br>  85) There is a modem and all right.  I consider a laptop with wimax an unnecessary thing for today.  Perhaps in the future it will be more in priority, but not now.  (+1) <br><br>  86) Only one type of USB modem, with moving parts, which is not impressive.  The Wimax routers line is too expensive, with functions necessary except for enterprises.  The absence of wimax routers for home use without unnecessary frills (ip-telephony, wifi, etc. - I would like the appearance of only Wimax-Ethernet routers).  (-five) <br><br>  87) Ezhzh - super veschchch, but dear, bitch hedgehog turned out.  (+1) <br><br>  88) Still, WiMAX router is very expensive (((+1) <br><br>  89) I bought myself a new NC10, set up for the win7 experiment.  What was my surprise that everything worked fine and the drivers for yota got up like relatives!  (+10) <br><br>  90) I chose Samsung for sure not for the love of the brand))) there was no choice ((-10) <br><br><h4>  Execution of obligations </h4><br>  91) I understand this test period ... But, as it were, January is nearing, and there is no improvement.  (-one) <br><br>  92) The farther into the forest, the greater the disappointment from the eta.  In Moscow (Mytishchi fair), commercial operation began in June 2009.  And in the same month, problems began.  Bottom line: today we do not use yota since August and do not pay.  Solid negative.  I agree with the worst estimates of the work of the office expressed here and not only here.  DISAPPOINTMENT.  That's what happens to them EVERYWHERE!  From the beginning, everything is OK, in a few days pi *** ec.  If someone initiates a lawsuit against them, I think we will win.  Very many nai ** li!  (-ten) <br><br>  93) Advertising ahead of opportunity.  It seems everything is annoying.  (+1) <br><br>  94) The main obligation is to provide quality Internet access services.  Unfortunately, it is not performed.  Maybe this is only in Moscow ... (-10) <br><br>  95) no obligations yet, beta test ... +1 is a type of trust)) (+1) <br><br>  96) No, not about these guys.  We will install new BS in a month.  Better then do not say anything than encouraging.  (-ten) <br><br>  97) Obligations are fulfilled in principle, even promises are generally fulfilled.  That already compares favorably with local orders.  :) There are certainly some narrow moments, not without them.  But in general, so far ice.  (+5) <br><br>  98) Cosmos promise in December, we argue it will not appear before the new year?  (-ten) <br><br>  99) Krasnodar.  In most places where I am signal quality is either average or good.  I work without antennas.  Everything suits me.  I would like a more equal coverage in the city and coverage on the edge, I hope it will be.  (+10) <br><br>  100) In the room does not catch.  When you go to the car constantly reconnects, seemingly slowly looking for the nearest BSKU.  In general, the horror to be honest, where it should catch on the map, it does not catch there (-5) <br><br>  <b>November 2009</b> <br>  Total votes: 6902 <br>  Total comments.  951 <br><br>  In the <a href="http://yt.yotatester.ru/yo5.php%3Fnominum%3D0%26dayl%3D1%26monthl%3D11%26yearl%3D2009%26dayr%3D30%26monthr%3D11%26yearr%3D2009">analytics</a> section of the service ‚ÄúYota.  People's Trust Index ‚Äùcan be found with all reviews in each nomination for the past quarter. <br><br>  <b>November custom picture: Go-go, Krasnodar.</b> <br>  The open test in Krasnodar will definitely go down in history.  Against the background of the continued sluggish struggle of users of other cities for improving the quality of services, residents of the sunny city broke all activity records, for a week putting the majority of base stations (base stations) in the city at zero.  Positive fanaticism of the local population can be conveyed by quoting an already well-known passage: <br>  <i>‚ÄúRespect for the Yetovo residents for that cheerful mess they staged in Krasnodar!</i>  <i>This I have not seen since the days of FIDO and batch BBSok.</i>  <i>People run away from work to screw the colander to the stool, and the stool to the balcony.</i>  <i>People broke away from the telephones and remembered that they had a mosk and began to construct antennas, CSS extenders and rewrite the firmware to the routers!</i>  <i>‚ÄúWhistles‚Äù were bought out in 2 days, I had to ‚ÄúDELIVER‚Äù the whistle through the ‚Äústore director‚Äù.</i>  <i>We remembered the word "deficit".</i>  <i>On the doors of the Magazins, there are signs ‚Äúthere are no ets and there will not be. Quite so.</i>  <i>We don‚Äôt know where we are (almost no pants)) Some fly to Moscow for modems!</i>  <i>Zombies walk around the city with happy smiles of idiots - they had 7 megabits per night tonight!</i>  <i>I heard from the lips of the blonde the words "decibel" and "signal / noise" (!).</i>  <i>Children are discussing not the new "Mazda-3" and the unpowered imported cartoons, but "DESTROYED PORTS ON TORRENTS, C $% AND!".</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Even if the Internet does not work at all, for that alone THANK YOU MUCH !!!</i>  <i>Maybe there will be less morons in our city \ country \ world.
