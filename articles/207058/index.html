      The authors of 8 strongest works will be invited to a lecture on the creation of concept art for the saints of the Russian gemdev - the office of Allods Team.  At the end of the lecture, all interested will have the opportunity to participate in the work on the game.  For those who can not attend the lecture, an online broadcast will be organized.  Participants from other cities will also have the opportunity to join the creation of a concept art for the game. <br><br>  <b>Start contest: December 20.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Summing up: January 20.</b> <br><br>  Questions about the conditions of the competition, you can ask <a href="http://vk.com/topic-53141502_29662714">here</a> . <br><br><h4>  Terms and Recommendations </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/096/a8a/8a2/096a8a8a292adc7e59fafe2838e3bbd6.jpg"><br><br>  It is necessary to create a helmet concept for a non-player character from the world of the Skyforge game, which will fit the design of the costume presented above and continue his idea. <br><br>  The costume was conceived for a hero similar to the centurion of the Roman army in the realities of the world of Skyforge.  Nevertheless, it is important to remember that this is not a Roman centurion, but only an outwardly similar character to it.  The helmet, as part of the costume, should follow this idea. <br><br>  The key direction of our design is the reworking of building familiar things with the use of art nouveau plastic (art nouveau).  The cut is not dictated by the economy of the material or the convenience of mechanical stamping, but by the creation of more artistic forms and the combination of utilitarian function and decoration.  Preference is also given to aesthetically more interesting fastener elements as opposed to real life, but with preservation of functionality and logic. <br><br>  We believe that some of the designs from Final Fantasy 13 or Star Wars convey the correct impression of reworking the construction of clothes, armor, fasteners and decor elements. <br><br>  To make the helmet look believable, the structure and functionality of real helmets must be taken as a basis.  It can be as modern military or sports helmets, and medieval.  You can draw on examples from movies and games, if they create the right feeling.  The point is that when looking at the helmet its structure and details do not seem to be non-functional or superfluous, so that logic can be traced in their location. <br><br>  This does not mean that you need to create a completely real helmet, justifying the location of each small detail.  Rather, it should only create the impression of a real-life object: everything should be logically aligned. <br><br>  An example of creating a jacket from the world of Skyforge on the principle "from general to particular": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/583/d57/ede/583d57ede7d3725118b21d5a96db2121.jpg"><br><br>  Examples of design helmets from the world of Star Wars: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b4/04f/0d4/2b404f0d468f9e93d7c81099a5cd1164.jpg"><br><br>  The simple form is divided into several simple forms, the combination of which sets the design of the helmet.  Wherever necessary, more detailed detailing has been added to create a sense of high-tech design: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/354/e23/dea/354e23dea17795ae3fce76427409d9ee.jpg"><br><br>  Helmets from Final Fantasy, Halo and Real Life: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a90/fa0/8ba/a90fa08ba1802958a5694d9b6795900c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b09/bd1/dee/b09bd1dee6103f2f2f4258a9b9a13b45.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea6/ff4/123/ea6ff41239e9ba5bd9383c4dfb62ea56.jpg"><br><br>  The selection of materials, their thickness, fastener elements, moving functional parts, the distribution of zones with different details, the general set of elements and the design - in all this it is better to rely on references, rather than on your own imagination.  For example, nothing prevents you from taking the design and functionality of a fantasy helmet, and the details and materials from the modern, to preserve the location of attachment points and only rework them.  No need to try to take into account in design all the ideas from the references, otherwise the work will be overloaded, take only what is necessary. <br><br>  It is important to create a concept taking into account the composition of the entire costume: the distribution of accents, materials used and the level of decoration.  The main emphasis should remain on the head (a unique color or just an active spot), but so that it does not stand out according to the degree of detail and materials.  It is important to monitor the fit and size of the head.  It often happens that the concept as a whole is not bad, but the head ‚Äúslides‚Äù forward or backward, does not coincide with the overall size of the figure or face, because of which the figure as a whole looks comical. <br><br>  <b>As a result, contestants must provide:</b> <br>  1) decorated helmet concept, <br>  2) reference list, <br>  3) a description of the development process. <br><br>  <b>We will evaluate the work of the following items:</b> <br>  1) matching the helmet with the character‚Äôs costume, <br>  2) design (credibility, work with materials). <br><br>  Please send the works in jpg format to the address <a href="http://concept.art%40corp.mail.ru/">concept.art@corp.mail.ru</a> <br><br>  <b>Frequently asked questions and answers to them:</b> <br><br>  <b>Q</b> : Will the sent options be used in the game? <br>  <b>A</b> : No, they will not.  For this character equipment is already fully prepared. <br><br>  <b>Q</b> : Will the work on the project of the contest winners be paid for? <br>  <b>A</b> : Yes, like any professional work, it will be paid. <br><br>  <b>Q</b> : Why do I need a lecture at all? <br>  <b>A</b> : To improve the quality of work of potential employees. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207058/</a></p>
