Many of us clicked the mouse for 10 years, after that 5 years clicked on the touchpad, and more recently they began to swipe their fingers across the screen. <br><br>  Soon the time will come when we will wave our hands in front of the screen - contactless control.  And the pioneer in this thorny path is Leap Motion, an American development whose sales have already begun all over the world (gray ones, of course).  I suggest you take a look at the review of this device and discuss the future ... <a name="habracut"></a>

This very technology allows you to recognize and capture the movement of hands or other objects, transforming it into actions on the computer.  A small USB device creates an invisible interaction field with a volume of about 227 cubic decimeters.  Leap tracks the movement of objects with great accuracy and allows a person to interact with a PC in contactless mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/35e/8cf/540/35e8cf5408f101aed72c81c90f0bdf58.png"><br><br>  These convoluted words ‚Äúhide‚Äù in a small device, resembling a 3G modem in size.  Its edging is made of aluminum, on top of where there are sensors, glass is installed, well, and in the lower part is a rubber gasket with the inscription Leap Motion. <br><br>  Tactile device is very nice and does not look cheap.  (And what technology offers!) <br><br>  Connecting to a computer using a USB-cable, where one of the ends is a combined microUSB + own connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/455/cb9/cf1/455cb9cf1dc1097caa1e838eec9eb578.png"><br><br>  Leap Motion comes with two USB cords - one long and one short. <br><br>  In order to get started with the device, you need to download software for Mac or PC on the site <a href="http://airspace.leapmotion.com/">airspace.leapmotion.com</a> . <br><br>  The AirSpace program itself is something like iTunes: with its own store and a set of programs that can only be run from this environment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ed/61f/dae/5ed61fdaec9b405f13c7d201957d61a0.png"><br><br>  The store has both paid and free apps and games.  Some of them <b>only</b> support Windows or Mac. <br><br>  There are no more than 100 unique applications in the store for this store, but what pleases is Fruit Ninja and Cut the Rope. <br><br>  There is also a program Touchless, which allows you to control the PC interface (WIndows / Mac) with the help of hands.  Without this program, it seems to me, the meaning of buying Leap disappears altogether.  In order to understand how the program works - see the review (above). <br><br>  It is difficult to judge how the device behaves with the software: with each differently.  In some programs, hand tracking is perfect, in some - disgusting.  I really liked the standard application with a 3D DNA model: it is really convenient and interesting to turn.  Cut the Rope is also quite fun to play. <br><br>  But all this is only a germ in a whole, I hope, era of human-PC interaction.  That's what Michael Buckwald, general director of Leap Motion, thinks about this: <br><br><blockquote>  <i>We want to create an application that will turn the world around, which will completely change a person‚Äôs interaction with the operating system or surfing the Internet ... Our goal is to fundamentally change the interaction between a computer and a person, that is, to do everything that was previously done with the mouse.</i>  <i>Undoubtedly, this will affect everyone, from simple everyday tasks to any technological process that you can imagine.</i> </blockquote><br><br>  So, undoubtedly, the Leap developers are looking far into the future, wanting to introduce their own vision of how to manage a computer.  But the mouse at first too little people liked! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c4/3e9/9dd/9c43e99dda2f90a7bac2b7addd544def.png"><br><br>  Moreover, at the end of this year, ASUS is going to release several models of Hi-end notebooks with built-in Leap Motion technology.  So the future is already coming on the heels! <br><br>  Leap Motion costs $ 80 in the USA.  In Russia, the price tag does not rise above 5 thousand (and, in principle, also does not fall).  It seems to me that even the Russian price is fully justified - the technology is new and interesting, therefore my opinion is absolute. <br><br>  Well, it is quite interesting to develop the world of technology.  He is really curious to watch him: I will not guess whether Leap Motion will become the technology of the future.  If it becomes - I will only be glad.  And if not - come up with something cooler.  Time will tell. <br><br>  Let's see how MYO will show itself ... <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oWu9TFJjHaM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500000,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjrE6nHQQN6E5JoTF_No8Nxut5VnA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190404/</a></p>
