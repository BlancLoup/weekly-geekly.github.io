  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Coursera has a course from a Nobel laureate with a Russian dubbing.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, a remarkable event took place at Coursera - a duplicated version of the Financial Markets course about financial resources was published. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d6/763/bf1/3d6763bf11e1554f7080a0f8b5e04a5f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And it is remarkable because previously there were no duplicate courses on the platform, and the first one appeared precisely in Russian.  Secondly, it was done on a private donation.  And thirdly, the course was delivered by a professor at Yale University, the 2013 Nobel Prize in Economics, Robert Schiller. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The videos were translated in parallel with the course of the course, and as I was told, by the middle of April several thousand Russian-speaking students had already joined the beautiful (who do not remember - everything is free on Coursera).  Now Russian content is available on Coursera.org via this link:

    <blockquote><h5>  <a href="https://class.coursera.org/financialmarkets-001">Financial Markets (Yale, 2014)</a> </h5></blockquote><br>  Section Video Lectures, section Russian.  Materials can be downloaded until June 15. <br><br>  Send all curses for errors to me.  You can in absentia, and you can personally - oleg.kononovov@gmail.com.  I would be grateful for any practical changes and comments. <br><br>  Thanks to Yura Kuzakov, Irina Vetokhina, Dima Sinitsyn and Vita Chekhlov - these people provided invaluable assistance, spent all their time, including weekends, on translation and reading of texts.  Without them, nothing would have happened and close.  If it is interesting, I can describe our experience of communication with Coursera and direct translation in more detail - it may be useful for future projects. <br><br>  Still it is necessary to say a special thank you to Yale University, who agreed to this experiment.  Apart from the fact that this has never happened on the Coursera, their platform still does not allow to let two audio tracks into one video.  Therefore, everything was done in manual mode.  And to do it in parallel with the course, the English videos for which were prepared at the last moment - and at all serious acrobatics. <br><br>  Judging by the reviews, the first experience was not bad.  But I still think that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãduplicating courses will probably remain an interesting experiment.  At least for the near future.  Not least because this story is difficult to scale on the current version of the Coursera platform.  Plus, this translation was quite expensive. <br><br>  Although in theory it would be possible to agree on a dubbing for a pair of established courses, if there is a demand for this (a transparent allusion to the community).  I will help all that I can, we can do a good thing together. <br><br>  PS If you understand English at least a little - see the original Robert Schiller course on Open Yale.  Not because the dubbing came out bad, but because the course on the Coursera was cut from these videos.  It rarely happens that successful economists are so human, direct, and can tell complex things so mundane.  And it is better to feel the magic of Schiller‚Äôs teaching manner in the original.
