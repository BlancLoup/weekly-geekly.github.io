The first members of the Z generation graduate from universities and enter the labor market.  Even if you currently have no ‚Äúzetas‚Äù in your submission, know that they will soon come to you to work. <br><br>  We figured out how employers find a common language with the ‚Äúdigital generation‚Äù.  <b>Alexander Shabanov</b> , who has been working in the field of staff recruitment and management for more than 12 years, helped us in this, and in the past he headed the EPAM training center in Izhevsk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b9/-1/-n/b9-1-nfhsi8y4w3iluwtihqjrru.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the nineties, American scientists William Strauss and Neil Howe developed a theory of generations.  According to her, people of one generation have similar attitudes and values, and a change of generations occurs about once every 20 years.

      For each generation, the researchers came up with a name.  If we talk about the second half of the last century, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_Y">generation Y</a> , the millennials, replaced <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_X">generation X</a> in the 1980s.  And the youngest is now the generation Z. Its representatives are also called post-millennials. <br><br>  Some experts say that people born after 2000 belong to generation Z.  For others, post millenials were born in the mid 1990s and later.  If we take the mid-nineties as a point of reference, now the oldest zet are a little more than 20 years old.  This is not much, but the generation already has its face.  It is the first in history that did not know life without the Internet and grew up surrounded by technology. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Shabanov</b> : ‚ÄúThe younger generation lives in a situation where there is a huge variety of professions - there are more choices than before.  Due to the fact that you can choose, many young people change jobs almost every six months.  In addition, it is now easier than before to go abroad and find a job there - especially IT-specialists.  And you can make such a choice: do not work at all.  Citizens of some developed countries may well live on benefits. " <br><br>  ‚ÄúMany young people quite correctly believe that the authorities do not care about them and do not help.  They feel abandoned.  This creates apathy and leads to the fact that a third of young people simply do nothing, ‚Äù <a href="https://platfor.ma/topic/samoe-neponyatnoe-y-neponyatoe-pokolenye-za-vsyu-ystoryyu-kak-21-vek-pokorezhyl-nashu-zhyzn/">says</a> researcher Nikola Vulich. <br><br>  How to behave to employers so that the Zetas want to work for them? <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ Stimulate with interesting challenges. </h4><br>  Millennials are characterized by <a href="https://megaplan.ru/letters/lucy">high expectations from themselves and from work</a> , for them success is to make a good career. <br><br>  The generation Z is different: they are more soberly looking at their careers.  This is evidenced by the results of a study by consulting company Altitude.  Success for ‚Äúzetas‚Äù is a feeling of happiness, pleasure from life, say the results <a href="https://adindex.ru/files2/news/2017_03/158487_youth_presentation.pdf">of the Sberbank research</a> .  Experts interviewed representatives of the "digital generation", and it turned out that they mostly expect happiness, comfort, well-being and peace of mind from life.  Respondents noted that a person who has worked all his life on an unloved job, but earned status and money, cannot be called successful.  This does not mean that money is not important for zetas.  They are sure: the work should not only <a href="http://klever.blog/talk-about-salary/">generate income</a> , but also be sure to be interesting. <br><br>  <b>Alexander Shabanov</b> : ‚ÄúIn my opinion, salaries stimulate young employees badly.  This has been in effect for a while, but in the long run, an individual is more interested in interest - if he consciously chose a job. <br><br>  I can not all dub under one comb, not all choose consciously.  For example, a couple of years ago, a fashion for front-end development abruptly appeared.  The demand for such specialists has taken off, and the threshold for entry into this area is lower than in others.  Make a page in HTML, writing a program in JS is easier than in Java.  I am not saying that it is easier to master a profession, but it is definitely easier to start working.  Front-end development has become a very popular area, and many random people have appeared there.  They came because the salaries are high, good conditions in IT companies.  Many of these employees have a consumer attitude towards work, for them the most important thing is money.  And for those who deliberately chose a job, interest and development is more important. ‚Äù <br><br>  The <a href="https://adindex.ru/files2/news/2017_03/158487_youth_presentation.pdf">Sberbank study</a> states that people of the Z generation are afraid of monotony and that adult life will be devoid of vivid impressions.  Try to get the zetas interested.  Give the opportunity in working hours to learn English or learn new technology, which will soon come in handy on the project.  Offer to participate in the mitap;  Appoint a young employee to a mentor - a senior colleague who will instill interest in the case and help develop. <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ Let's get several tasks at once. </h4><br>  The Zetas have never had any problems finding an occupation.  On the contrary, since childhood, the choice is too large: in the public domain - thousands of books, films, games, courses.  There are so many around and time is limited.  Therefore, post-millennials perceive information much faster than their predecessors: they adapt from an early age to filter the necessary from the unnecessary.  They need only eight seconds to do this, according to the results of a research by Altitude Consulting Company. <br><br>  Researchers <a href="https://adindex.ru/files2/news/2017_03/158487_youth_presentation.pdf">point out</a> that ‚Äúdigital children‚Äù are used to consuming a variety of information in small pieces and do it continuously.  In addition, the Zetas are comfortable learning a new one from several channels at the same time.  They watch the program and immediately google something unfamiliar;  Choosing products, listen to the podcast - otherwise they get bored.  Since the brain is accustomed to the rapid processing of information, they feel uncomfortable when there is little information. <br><br>  So boldly, let the Zetas have several tasks at once: they will always have something to switch to, and they will not waste their working time. <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ Do not constrain the scope of graphics </h4><br>  When the Zetas grew, they saw that in order to earn money, it was not necessary to be in the office from 9 am to 6 pm.  Generation Y, their predecessors, had the opportunity to choose: work in the office or at home, on schedule or not.  Many people have enough laptop and good internet to work with.  The previous generations did not have such a choice, but for the ‚Äúzeta‚Äù the opportunity to choose the place and time of work is a given. <br><br>  Researchers <a href="https://adindex.ru/files2/news/2017_03/158487_youth_presentation.pdf">say</a> that generation Z is committed to alternative forms of employment (freelancing, teleworking).  It is important for them that the work does not take all day and there is time for a hobby. <br><br>  It is clear that the "zetas" are critical of the schedule "from 9 to 6 in the office."  You can complete tasks and communicate with colleagues using a laptop.  So it is important to be a certain number of hours in some place to produce a result? <br><br>  If your company has such an opportunity, do not drive young employees into the framework of the schedule, because the main thing in the work is that it should be carried out qualitatively and on time. <br><br><h4>  ‚Ä¢ Give feedback often </h4><br>  <b>Alexander Shabanov</b> : ‚ÄúIn Soviet times, praise was only public and only for special merits.  When a person wanted to thank, hung his photo on the board of honor.  I grew up in reality, when expressing personal emotions and often giving feedback was not accepted.  And the current younger generation perceives feedback as the norm. ‚Äù <br><br>  As soon as ‚Äúdigital children‚Äù have smartphones, they are registered in social networks and start to put likes.  They get used to being constantly evaluated.  According to the researchers, for the post-Millennial notions ‚Äúrecognition‚Äù and ‚Äúsocial popularity‚Äù are equal.  In addition, it is noted: ‚Äúzetas‚Äù are raised in such a way that they expect praise for any adult action - for example, when they have solved the problem on their own. <br><br>  So for people of generation Z, approval is extremely important - not only in social networks, but also in real life, including at work.  Failback without taking them out of the rut, so do not skimp on the feedback.  This does not mean that they should be constantly praised, just notice more often what they are doing and be sincere with them. <br><br>  Do not believe, if you are told about the ‚Äúlost generation‚Äù, which ‚Äúonly does what it sits on the phones‚Äù.  If you know about the strengths of the Zetas, you can work well together. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/425777/">https://habr.com/ru/post/425777/</a></p>
