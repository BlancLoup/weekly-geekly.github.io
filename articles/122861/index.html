Because it was we who invented driving around the traffic jam in reverse on the counter, justifying our behavior by an emergency stop.  All countries are building high-speed autobahns, but only here you can go across the road and cut to the left from the rightmost row.  We proudly call our country "Russia", and foreigners enviously say - "Rush".  But still it is ours.  Our rashka. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/940744bb/36485eee/235d60fb/2686b3bf.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps my article will help you determine the choice of such a device as a DVR - a device that in our Rush should be in every vehicle.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Understanding the need for such a device matured long ago, but the decisive role was played by the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/117006/">article</a> Boomburum about a pretty good model, <b>Karkam Q4 Lite</b> .  I advise you to read the article if you suddenly missed it - at least because, in addition to a detailed review of the device, it contains many useful tips and arguments about many "common things".  I want to tell you about the DVR model that he mentioned at the very beginning, <b><a href="http://carcam.ru/carcamq2.html">Karkam Q2</a></b> - a berry from the same field as Q4 Lite.  I‚Äôll say right away that the review will be superficial, since 90% of the statements about Q4 Lite turned out to be valid for my Q2 too, so there is no point in re-taking your time. <br><br>  Why did I choose this device?  For several reasons - the presence of the screen and the built-in battery, small size and excellent technical characteristics (they are written at the very end).  And, of course, a lower price, 6500 rubles - this is not so little, but less than that of Q4.  Well, to be honest, I just saw this device from a friend - I twisted it in my hands, pushed the buttons and realized that this is what I need. <br><br>  Equipment: the DVR itself, mounting on the glass (through a special adapter), car charging, AV-wire for the TV and instructions.  Memory cards were not included, it had to be bought separately.  Here the more and faster (higher class), the better - I took 32 GB.  However, do not forget to see the maximum amount supported in the instructions - especially if you order a ‚Äútwin brother‚Äù from abroad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1307ddd7/3111fa51/a2d8acb9/713e1903.jpg"><br><br>  Trifle, but pleasant - a case of dense fabric that protects the recorder around the perimeter.  It can be worn on a belt, so the question ‚Äúwhere to clean when leaving the car‚Äù was partially helped by the manufacturer himself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6f819068/21962e9a/72ebe458/205be653.jpg"><br><br>  The DVR has almost the same dimensions as the average mobile phone, such as Sony Ericsson, can be slightly thicker.  The body is made of matte plastic, on which no prints remain.  The back side looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/163e27de/973b1ee2/fadd4862/e5a2c23b.jpg"><br><br>  Not immediately, I noticed that the cover (under the lens) is removed - under it there is a removable battery, exactly the same as in many nokiyah.  Keep this in mind if you need spy autonomous shooting (in all other cases, external power from the cigarette lighter will be used). <br><br>  Wide-angle lens, microphone hole and IR illumination (also useful in spy games): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7ccfac4e/5a8777cd/ea27dd04/3f5c7131.jpg"><br><br>  The body consists of two parts - the upper unit (with a lens) can be tilted about 30 degrees (example below).  This allows you to more flexibly adjust the field of view of the device in the car. <br><br>  On the front side there is a color LCD screen (2 '', non-touch), a speaker, a record button and a multifunctional 5-way joystick. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a33/212/2b2/a332122b2cebf8556304554c9e06b324.jpg"><br><br>  And the IR filter switch.  Thanks to the combined operation of the IR filter, IR illumination and the day / night mode (the result of which is a multiple increase in sensitivity with a low level of illumination), Karkam Q2 can cope with taking pictures of the traffic situation not only during the day but at night! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/51d3e672/d64da61a/6395762c/ac093a7c.jpg"><br><br>  In the lower part there is a lockable slot for an SD card, a threaded hole for mounting on a tripod, as well as an ‚Äúeyelet‚Äù for the lace (it is included): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/48470fd7/14f9e248/91d4e70b/021ed34f.jpg"><br><br>  There are buttons on the side - to turn on the device, to switch modes, to play recorded files and to enter the settings menu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2c744578/2b66285f/f7208814/6474303a.jpg"><br><br>  On the opposite side is a rubber plug, under which, as can be seen from the signature, are the HDMI, miniUSB and AV connectors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2e3ef9a2/4137189f/8b3c40aa/e295a1ab.jpg"><br><br>  It is noteworthy that the plug popped up and was lost at the very first use - apparently, the Tajiks at the sink thought it was garbage.  Without it, it became more convenient to connect the power, but it‚Äôs bad that the connectors were left without protection: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/2098a06c/921f843c/1fa9ba73/489c50b0.jpg"><br><br>  Have you already noticed that the device has no holes for mounting on the mount?  Yes, Karkam Q2 is ‚Äúworn‚Äù through a special adapter from the kit, unlike Q4.  It is doing well, but in the first times there were some difficulties with dismantling the recorder - a couple of times he fell in the cabin when I tried to take it off (for seroballs - not a single recorder was hurt while writing the review!).  Here is the complete set: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/29616b1c/aa363f0a/bd7d26e4/cd001053.jpg"><br><br>  There are a lot of devices with the same appearance - just yesterday, having entered ‚ÄúION‚Äù, I found another one, ‚Äúnot like all‚Äù.  But even visually, there was a much lower quality of the case, so the conclusion is simple - the Chinese simply decided once again not to spend money on different molds, and the ‚Äúproducers‚Äù were completely satisfied with this approach. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c46a9d30/59c37309/cbb6832f/1d1c85c6.jpg"><br><br>  We can not exclude the fact that inside these devices have the same stuffing, but Karkam‚Äôs uniqueness lies precisely in the software from our craftsmen, which, in my opinion, gives him a number of undoubted advantages (the list of functions that I checked for work): <br><br>  - The possibility of overlaying the image of information such as the registration number of the car (it is in the Russian format - in court this moment will greatly increase the chance of recording becoming evidence). <br>  - Recording function of the motion detector (can be useful if you need a record when you leave the car alone) <br>  - The function of creating a backup "for the protocol" (in the internal memory of the device).  I myself was not in an accident, but I read on the forums that the inspector can pick up (in your interests as soon as possible attach it to the case, in order to exclude in the examination suspicions of record falsification) a memory card for the protocol - what then may happen to it, does not know no one! <br>  - The function of the digital zoom when viewing the recording on a small monitor of the DVR.  It is useful when viewing small parts, such as car numbers. <br>  - The function of automatically turning on and off the recording after power on. <br>  - Flip the screen image and reassign the action of the joystick when installing the recorder camera down. <br>  - Correct saving of the video file when the battery is low. <br>  - Display (in preview) of the date / time of file creation and its size. <br>  - Built-in editor - it allows you to quickly cut the desired part of the file. <br>  - Copy function in the editor - to copy the desired fragment from the source file.  With the ability to set protection against deletion - after all, recording on the memory card is carried out "in a circle"! <br><br>  There is a dilemma - to order cheap Chinese from abroad or to buy here, but with the support and necessary regional features.  I read a lot of reviews online and decided to take ‚Äúours‚Äù - at least there will be someone to contact, if that (including on the forums).  If you decide to follow my path, I will give one piece of advice - when buying Q2, pay attention that the registrar is revision 6.1.  In the last paragraph of the second page of the menu should be written " <b>v3.7 T2L-GH</b> " - if there is no such inscription, then this is not Karkam. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I did not have to use the device about which Boomburum wrote (it has Q4 Lite).  But comparing the highest possible video quality, I conclude that it is almost the same (as well as the price of DVRs).  So if we talk about the choice between these two devices, the choice will be reduced to the choice of body type.  But Q2 also has a couple of advantages (again, judging by the review) - more compact dimensions, the camera can change its angle, the IR filter switch is on the convenient side, instead of a rare connector, miniUSB is used (and HDMI instead of miniHDMI), a removable battery, as well as a case and strap included.  But Q4 has convenient buttons (front, not side) and a more robust case (such as shockproof) - for some, these parameters may be more important than anything else. <br><br>  Unfortunately, there is only one video example at hand (you can compare it with the quality of Q4).  Do not forget to switch to HD viewing mode! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZGQ912Moots%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg1fLmogS0mrFvI1F60Fhruo2Zuyg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As you can see, the quality of the picture is very good - ‚Äúreal‚Äù 30 frames per second, with sound (even if it is not very high quality - especially if music is playing in the car) and at resolutions up to 1920x1080!  This is enough to capture in detail even the most dynamic road scene. <br><br>  At night, things are a little worse - the infrared filter is not as good as we would like (it doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù so far, but blinds in the opposite light).  But if, for example, bi-xenon headlights are installed, then you can write video without IR illumination - you can simply switch the recording to B / W mode so that there is less noise. <br><br>  Very pleased with the quality of the recording.  You can take photos, but obviously, such photos are not for a family photo album. <br><br><h3>  Karkam Q2.

But such a device may just be useful in the household - nothing prevents you from using it as a small photo or video camera with IR illumination - in ordinary cameras, the function of night shooting is almost never met.  The device copes with the assigned tasks ideally, it is not necessary to wait for anything else special, although the anti-radar or GPS functions would really not be superfluous. <br><br>  And you use the DVR and, if so, how?  It would be great if every owner in the comments writes at least a couple of lines about his experience of using such devices - it is interesting to look at the overall picture of this segment.  If you have something to say, I suggest this comment format: model name + small picture + price + key characteristics + pros / cons + overall impression.  An example of an image (photo-video) can be inserted by reference. <br><br>  Go? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122861/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122861/</a></p>
