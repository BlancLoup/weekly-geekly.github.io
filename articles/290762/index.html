      But some time has passed, and now he is giving a speech for graduates at the USC Marshall School of Business.  The youngest billionaire on this planet who invented an instant messenger to exchange photos, videos, messages, evaporating in 10 seconds.  A year and a half ago, he refused Facebook, because the guys wanted to acquire Spiegel's invention for $ 3 billion.  He, of course, thought it was too little, and rejected the offer.  After some time, the value of the company reached $ 15 billion.  Probably, this guy drinks a lot of champagne and desperately risks! <br><br>  The main points of his speech: <br><br><h3>  <font color="#f04c40">1. Use what makes you stand out from the crowd</font> </h3><br>  He remembered his fake prom at Stanford, when he, not having received just a few credits, was sitting in the same gown as all his friends, and felt terribly embarrassed. <br>  Spiegel says that we all feel the need to recognize that we all want to be part of something whole, but at the same time we often forget about the very thing that distinguishes us, makes us unique. <br><br><br><h3>  <font color="#f04c40">2. Respect the one who comes after you.</font> </h3><br>  This thesis, to be honest, we were surprised by Spiegel.  After all, this person created the application, the messages in which disappear in 10 seconds ... what kind of eternity and continuity are we talking about? <br>  Okay.  Let's believe the guy, because he, even if he doesn‚Äôt really believe that he is building a company for those who then continue his work and improve his creation, he is building a corporate culture and trying to promote his personal philosophy. <br><br><br><h3>  <font color="#f04c40">3. Think of something you don‚Äôt want to sell.</font> </h3><br>  We here remembered one joke: <br><blockquote>  - Never work for money, find what you love! <br>  ‚ÄúBut I love money ...‚Äù <br></blockquote><br>  Here we just quote: <br>  ‚ÄúPeople often ask me:‚Äú Why don't you sell your business?  He's not even making you any money. "  This is my point.  You can be in the boat right now.  Everybody loves boats.  What's wrong with you? ‚Äù <br><br>  Spiegel admits that he loves his business very much and that he is passionate about him, therefore he sarcastically answers questions about the sale of Snapchat to Zuckerberg. <br><br>  So, for those who are in a boat or just floundering in the ocean without a lifeline: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ng0fXIITt0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg76iGRjRUD7eMhrHrRrX9EsTyGig" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290762/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290762/</a></p>
