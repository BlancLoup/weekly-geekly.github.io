In addition, all these years, I helped turn <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/" title="r / RoguelikeDev">r / RoguelikeDev</a> into the largest online community of roguelike developers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The report ‚ÄúHow to create a Roguelike‚Äù is also available in the form of a video (see the clip below).  This article is a text version of the same report for those who prefer a readable format or want to take a closer look at a bunch of images from the report. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jviNpRGuCIU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h1>  Introduction </h1><br>  A couple of years ago at the <a href="https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/2016/09/roguelike-celebration-2016-experience/" title="Roguelike Celebration 2016, the Experience">first Roguelike Celebration holiday</a> I read a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D9yJflbg0V38" title="From Hobbyist to Full-time Roguelike Developer">report on how I became a developer</a> , but now I want to talk about how <em>anyone</em> can start developing their own roguelike.  Quite often, roguelike players at least try to create them.  We are inspired by games that we play and want to do something better, something else, or just something of our own.  My report will definitely not be a tutorial, it‚Äôs more about how to start developing and general tips that can help you along the way.

The diagram below shows you embarking on your journey, and on top is your goal: an interesting playable game. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54b/3f6/422/54b3f642233732c7eee646004eeaa11a.png"></div><br>  <em>At the start, attention, @!</em> <br><br>  Your path can easily be like this, randomly evolving in every possible direction, while you are trying to add to the game each invented system and not having a clear overall route: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d64/fc3/94d/d64fc394d16c3d640a5058b6903d5ca6.gif"></div><br>  <em>Indirect approximation to your goal.</em>  <em>Someday ... (This is an animation - open the image in a separate window to start the process again.)</em> <br><br>  Yes, you can reach or barely touch your goal, but at what cost?  May be wasted for many years.  Along the way, you are most likely to run into too many dead ends, then lose heart and give up the game. <br><br>  In fact, you need the shortest path to the goal.  Having a basic plan and an understanding of what needs to be done, you can start from a solid foundation and only <em>then</em> , when you get an interesting core of the game, continue to develop it in the right direction! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c71/c54/701/c71c5470162a1df4e371fdc2261e457b.gif"></div><br>  <em>First, go straight to the goal and start with a solid foundation.</em>  <em>(This is an animation - open the image in a separate window so that the process starts again.)</em> <br><br>  In this article, I will mainly talk about the basics, how to travel around the dungeon with the greatest chances of success, especially when you are just starting out and are enthusiastic, but not quite sure where to go. <br><br>  Content: <br><br><ul><li>  Tongue </li><li>  Scale </li><li>  Basic mechanics </li><li>  7DRL </li><li>  Resources </li><li>  Bait </li><li>  Tips </li></ul><br>  Remember, this article talks about how to <em>start</em> creating a roguelike, but does not talk about how to <em>finish it</em> .  Here you are alone. <br><br><h1>  Tongue </h1><br>  Let's start with the first and most standard question: which language to use. <br><br>  The answer is simple: <em>any</em> . <br><br>  A slightly longer answer: this is not very important.  If you already have experience with some language, then this is excellent, take it and use it.  Language is only a means, and almost all languages ‚Äã‚Äãhave been used to create a roguelike. <br><br>  However, it cannot be said that if you are a beginner, then there are no simpler options, so if you hesitate, I will help you with advice: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff8/a29/fe6/ff8a29fe63b5456fc839f1a9c0ed0e88.png"></div><br>  <em>Sample python code from the tutorial on libtcod.</em> <br><br>  For roguelike novice developers, Python is often recommended, because it‚Äôs pretty easy to work with.  Just look at this code.  There are no heaps of strange syntax here, and even if you don‚Äôt know programming or Python, you can probably still figure out what is going on in it. <br><br>  But don't worry, its ‚Äúsimplicity‚Äù is not the limiting factor - in Python, you can still create great things. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/038/f35/178/038f35178e2fb23c2189543fe1eea668.png"></div><br>  <em><a href="http://www.ultimaratioregum.co.uk/game/" title="Ultima Ratio Regum website">Ultima Ratio Regum is</a> written in Python.</em>  <em>This is a beautiful massive open world project that is not yet complete, but already incredibly impressive.</em> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/79a/d2b/94d/79ad2b94d279199bdebfa89ec089385e.png"></div><br>  <em><a href="http://www.thetempleoftorment.net/" title="Temple of Torment website">Temple of Torment</a> is another voluminous and complete fantasy roguelike written in Python.</em> <br><br>  There are literally <em>hundreds</em> written in Python roguelike.  That is, if you start with it, your journey will be easier, and later we will return to how to begin with it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/494/0bc/35c/4940bc35c6efab5b844a36387c639a6b.png"></div><br>  <em>A selection of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãused by roguelike developers.</em> <br><br>  More complex languages ‚Äã‚Äãlike C and C ++ are good because they have been popular for a very long time, that is, you will find a lot of resources and reference information.  I work with C ++, but I use it only because I already knew it.  I would not recommend it for newbies, especially if you want to create a roguelike, and not spend all your time debugging!  You will still find many other developers using Python, so you will also have access to a bunch of resources. <br><br><h1>  Scale </h1><br>  Another problem facing new developers: the creation of a "roguelike of their dreams."  Should this be your first goal?  Almost never! <br><br>  At first, you learn a <em>lot</em> , make mistakes that you don‚Äôt even realize, so first of all it‚Äôs better to accumulate certain experience.  More importantly, from the beginning to the end, the priorities of game development change dramatically, so before taking on major major projects, it is better to go through the whole process one or two times.  Maintaining a small scale is the best way to complete a project and demonstrate the result of your efforts. <br><br>  Let's return to the development map discussed above.  Here is the main path you need to focus on: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ac/6b5/eb7/8ac6b5eb72dc309e8ed002abc5babc91.png"></div><br>  <em>The main development route affects only a selection of the necessary functions (note that I usually put a question mark in front of the combat (‚Äúcombat‚Äù), because in roguelike fights are not always used!).</em> <br><br>  This can be either a completed game, or a reliable basis on which to develop further.  All other areas may seem interesting to explore, but try not to be too far from the main path in the early stages.  It‚Äôs like a roguelike game: if you start by blindly running out of obscurity instead of doing what you need, then if the RNG is not completely on your side, you will quickly die somewhere.  And many times.  Yes, it is also interesting to play this way, but creating a roguelike is a completely different story that requires a lot of time, so try to concentrate. <br><br>  The good thing is that you can build a roguelike piece by piece.  In fact, they are a jumble of systems that you can add if you think that they support the main core of the game. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4de/376/08a/4de37608a1aa6acf76bcfa7a715225bd.png"></div><br>  <em>Addition to the core of roguelike new pieces.</em> <br><br>  After that, you can constantly expand the game and continue to iterate, and if you're lucky, get feedback from players. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28e/f4d/c4e/28ef4dc4e0978d6afe2e34230462d426.png"></div><br>  <em>New pieces!</em> <br><br>  As a result, you will glue so many pieces to the base that you will not notice how the ten years will pass! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f1/e58/9c6/3f1e589c64afbf280e30de2c3d3eebbc.png"></div><br>  <em>o_O</em> <br><br>  If you look at the roguelike project as a whole, it is scary, but in reality you only need a plan and perseverance.  Starting small is important because you will make mistakes, and most likely will fail if you aim for something big right away. <br><br><h1>  Basic mechanics </h1><br>  So what really needs a small roguelike?  Basic mechanics.  That is where the gameplay begins.  It is necessary that it can be explained in one sentence, and that it should be prototyped first.  Straightforward to the most interesting part of the game. <br><br>  What will be the unique view of the game on the genre of roguelike?  If your game <em>only has</em> this mechanic, will it be interesting?  If you're already thinking about more, can this mechanic be the basis of the rest of the game?  Think about what the player will do minute by minute, most likely it will be something related to the basic mechanics.  If this repetitive process is not interesting, then it does not matter that you build on top of it! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa8/7e4/f4e/aa87e4f4e4fedb8500c59389633290ad.gif"></div><br>  <em>Visualization of basic mechanics as the foundation of roguelike design.</em> <br><br>  So, in this initial proto-game, implement only those external elements that are necessary for the implementation and testing of basic mechanics.  I repeat, the scheme shown above and its branches may be scary, but this is just an example of what is possible.  Roguelike can be very simple and at the same time truly fascinating. <br><br>  To learn a little more basic mechanics, let's look at the 7DRL. <br><br><h1>  7DRL </h1><br>  7DRL is a roguelike created in 7 days.  Approximately in March of each year an event is held where many developers are trying to create their own roguelike.  This event has been held for 14 years.  And it's great, because if you finish the game, then there will definitely be at least a few people who will play it and leave feedback.  In addition, there are judges who evaluate games according to various criteria, however, almost all developers consider 7DRL to be their first challenge (the event is not considered a competition). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a08/67d/f32/a0867df321547b6450f11d647f18656d.png"></div><br>  <em>7DRL successes by year (2005-2018).</em> <br><br>  Every year more than a hundred new roguelikes are produced at this event.  This is very fascinating, and although I do not recommend creating 7DRL as the first game (you don‚Äôt need such a load yet), it would be nice to participate, having gained some experience and understanding what roguelike is, especially in technical aspects, because deadline is very helps to gather. <br><br>  The 7DRL events are great examples of the ‚Äústart small and expand as needed <em>after</em> you have seen that the basic mechanics look good.‚Äù  That is, on the 7DRL, in fact, good prototypes are created, and in many respects the measures are experimental in nature.  Every year we see a lot of great innovative ideas! <br><br>  Let's look at a few examples ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e35/900/d24/e35900d2485ac7059571109f3c7e80df.png"></div><br>  <em>Knight (7DRL 2014)</em> <br><br>  The most important thing in <a href="" title="Knight 7DRL download">Knight</a> is controlling the inertia of the character.  The player sits on the horse most of the time, a small blue block around the center is an area in which you can move, only in one space per turn, and that is where you will find yourself in the next turn.  The player can only accelerate, turn and slow down, that is, he needs to plan the direction of attacks on moving enemies in order to decapitate them with his sword while passing nearby. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff1/293/6e2/ff12936e21c541c8abf4577c2eec006c.png"></div><br>  <em>A Roguelike Where You Dodge Projectiles (7DRL 2016)</em> <br><br>  I like that in this 7DRL the basic mechanics is stated right in the title (‚ÄúRoguelike, in which shells should be avoided‚Äù, you can download it <a href="https://forums.roguetemple.com//index.php%3Ftopic%3D4958.0" title="Rogue Temple: A Roguelike Where You Dodge Projectiles">here</a> ).  The player's character is a ship in space, and even though you automatically attack enemies within your area of ‚Äã‚Äãaction, the shells fired by enemies fly very slowly.  You can see where they will be in the next turn, and you must maneuver in such a way as to continue to attack them and avoid getting into your ship. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a2/82b/d7d/9a282bd7dd0334b90ad3a69a182cb5bc.png"></div><br>  <em>Seven Day Band (7DRL 2015)</em> <br><br>  In the <a href="http://www.zincland.com/7drl/7dayband/" title="Seven Day Band 7DRL web page">Seven Day Band,</a> you create your own roguelike during the game.  While wandering around the world, you meet new, unknown enemies and objects and must give them names and abilities at the first meeting, or when they become important to you.  (‚ÄúBand‚Äù in the title means creating your own game in the Angband style.) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/264/7ed/2e8/2647ed2e8688cb58d4a08bda49154e7e.png"></div><br>  <em>Broken Bottle (7DRL 2011)</em> <br><br>  In <a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php%3Ftitle%3DBroken_Bottle" title="RogueBasin: Broken Bottle 7DRL">Broken Bottle</a> you play as an alcoholic in a post-apocalyptic world.  Good or bad, but the main part of the gameplay is related to alcohol consumption.  (The game is heavily focused on the plot.) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba7/d7f/9e3/ba7d7f9e36fafb20437f59bc37e5aeaa.png"></div><br>  <em>Drakefire Chasm (7DRL 2012)</em> <br><br>  In <a href="http://dowhilecompiling.blogspot.com/p/drakefire-chasm.html" title="Drakefire Chasm 7DRL web page">Drakefire Chasm,</a> you control a young dragon fighting in caves filled with monsters, adventurers, and other dragons.  There are no items in the game, you just upgrade the dragon's abilities and eat enemies to grow and develop.  From time to time updates are released for the game. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b37/2e5/e79/b372e5e7955f4bfbb03fac9d5db6657b.png"></div><br>  <em>Golden Krone Hotel (7DRL 2014)</em> <br><br>  At <a href="http://humbit.com/gkh/7drl.html" title="Golden Krone Hotel 7DRL web page">Golden Krone Hotel,</a> you take advantage of the different abilities of the vampire and human forms of the character, including interaction with dynamic light.  This game eventually turned into a serious commercial roguelike, and after the release a year ago, it showed itself well on Steam. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/492/f85/e7e/492f85e7e5edd88fb9ce7097cfe80bf4.png"></div><br>  <em>Cogmind 7DRL (2012)</em> <br><br>  This is my original <a href="http://cogmindrl.blogspot.com/" title="Cogmind 7DRL website">Cogmind 7DRL</a> , in which the player controls a robot that creates itself from scratch using parts of other robots.  Objects are destroyed extremely quickly, so the player often has to rebuild himself again.  This game later also became a much larger commercial project.  I did not expect that my small experiment on the 7DRL six years ago to turn into work, but I am very glad that I took part in the event, because it proved the basic mechanics are interesting. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e90/cf9/df4/e90cf9df4ceb2a9a6be9cb2e1d5ff5fe.png"></div><br>  <em>POLYBOT-7 (7DRL 2018)</em> <br><br>  This year, for 7DRL, I created <a href="https://kyzrati.itch.io/polybot-7" title="POLYBOT-7 7DRL web page">POLYBOT-7</a> , which is somewhat similar to Cogmind, but it plays completely differently, because the basic mechanics have been greatly changed.  The player no longer chooses which parts to attach to the robot, now they are attracted automatically and he cannot get rid of them.  Parts are deleted only if they are destroyed.  Initially, I planned that the game would become Cogmind on a smaller scale, but with the approach of 7DRL I began to feel that such a game should not be created - it should have a truly unique attractive feature, a completely new basic mechanics.  It turned out to be quite interesting and became a good reason for creating many additional mechanics supporting a new type of gameplay (there is a comparison <a href="https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/2018/03/polybot-7-2018-7drl/" title="POLYBOT-7, a 2018 7DRL">here</a> ; I also wrote a <a href="https://www.gridsagegames.com/blog/2018/03/7drl-postmortem-part-1-preparation/" title="2018 7DRL Postmortem, Part 1: Preparation">voluminous post-mortem</a> describing the process of its development from beginning to end). <br><br>  So, although these games obviously have several systems, it‚Äôs pretty obvious what their basic mechanics are, and, along with many other 7DRLs, they stand out from the crowd. <br><br><h1>  Examples not with 7DRL </h1><br>  Let's also look at a few examples not related to 7DRL.  The creation of these games took years, they contain heaps of systems and content, but we can see.  that they revolve around basic mechanics. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b35/96e/c90/b3596ec900c805d351432fbea6e9ad15.png"></div><br>  <em>Mage guild</em> <br><br>  There is a <a href="http://lukossoftware.com/node/8" title="Mage Guild home page (archived because the site went down years ago)">Mage Guild</a> in which there is an amazing alchemy system that allows the player to mix <em>any two items</em> , be it potions, monster remains or something else, and get all sorts of new items and effects. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa1/820/4ef/aa18204ef63d5c205a4771ebbc8b2605.png"></div><br>  <em>Demon</em> <br><br>  In <a href="http://demon.ferretdev.org/" title="Demon home page">Demon, a</a> player hires a lot of different demons autonomously following him, and trains them. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b67/f0b/5ca/b67f0b5ca29547ad25e58c7d7d055d80.png"></div><br>  <em>The ground gives way</em> <br><br>  There is <a href="http://www.thegroundgivesway.com/" title="Th Ground Gives Way home page">The Ground Gives Way</a> , in which there is a development based entirely on objects. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56e/ac8/9a8/56eac89a8b27f05647778447ae1062f0.jpg"></div><br>  <em>Xenomarine</em> <br><br>  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/676830/Xenomarine/" title="Xenomarine on Steam">Xenomarine is</a> built on long-range mechanics and taking into account the direction of gaze - not many roguelike have it. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b2/81c/9e3/3b281c9e3390a4cf56444af0f0bdaa6c.png"></div><br>  <em>Nethack</em> <br><br>  One of the developers of <a href="https://www.nethack.org/" title="NetHack home page">NetHack</a> once told me that the basic mechanics of NetHack is this: "if it seems that something can be done, then most likely it can be done."  (This is <em>almost</em> like anti-base mechanics, such an example should not be taken by a new developer, but that‚Äôs what it is.) <br><br><h1>  Sources </h1><br>  One of the most important things that you need access to in order to develop roguelike is <em>information</em> .  It includes learning the basics, getting answers to questions, studying further more complex topics, or just food for thought. <br><br>  Your difficulties may be unique compared to other developers, because each has its own set of skills and personality, but you can use online resources and the help of friends to overcome these obstacles.  Although on your project, except for you, most likely no one will work, people can, if necessary, give you advice.  But you need to ask for help!  To understand this, it took me too much time, and my initial progress was rather slow, because I never communicated with people.  Therefore, I must tell you that others can be of great help to you! <br><br>  Let's look at the most useful resources ... <br><br><h2>  r / RoguelikeDev </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/" title="r / RoguelikeDev">RoguelikeDev</a> Sabreddit is the largest group of active roguelike developers in the universe.

However, <em>besides this,</em> it performs many complex tasks specific to roguelike, such as map generation, FOV (scope), and path searching. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c00/f3e/280/c00f3e2802bd78fc4447cca4c5830465.png"></div><br>  <em>Examples of functions used in the libtcod interactive demo.</em> <br><br>  The Ultima Ratio Regum and Temple of Torment described above began as games created using this tutorial, and gradually grew into unique projects.  libtcod is great, updates have been released for it for ten years now. <br><br>  Another way to start learning is to participate in the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/wiki/python_tutorial_series" title="r / RoguelikeDev summer tutorial / code-along records">summer event ‚Äúwe code together‚Äù</a> r / RoguelikeDev.

So you will interest more people, which in turn will support your motivation.</font></font><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba9/614/11d/ba961411d9cd1916e2e0365d2b580c9b.jpg"></div><br> <em><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Now Gregory is working on a sequel: </font></font><a href="http://armouredcommander.com/" title="ArmCom2 website"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ArmCom 2</font></font></a><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> . </font></font></em> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Remember that your game does not have to be just a roguelike. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here I feel a little naughty, saying that you should not be limited to definitions. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Often we see people coming up with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe game they want to create, but too worried about whether everyone will find it roguelike. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, it does not matter, because there are as many genres as there are players! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the game is complete and follows your own plan, then you are on the right path. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(But don‚Äôt worry, in the Roguelikes subreddit, weekly disputes will still arise as to whether your game is roguelike xD)</font></font><br><br><h2><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> XRL </font></font></h2><br>  Now make a 180-degree turn.  You can choose another approach that has its own advantages - XRL.  Such games are based on already existing franchises, and they save you a lot of planning and design efforts that can be directed to creating a game, because most often there is a ready answer to many questions.  The maximum you need to do is to adapt them to roguelike formulas.  When working on XRL, you can focus on implementation and other basics without experimenting with something new. <br><br>  This path is chosen by many developers.  Some time ago I created a <a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php%3Ftitle%3DRoguelikes_based_on_Existing_IPs" title="RogueBasin: Roguelikes Based on Existing IPs">list of XRL examples on RogueBasin</a> .  All roguelike described below are based on already existing intellectual property (IP). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/119/76a/2fc/11976a2fcc1cd4c3fdea83d58f4df09c.png"></div><br>  <em>Incomplete XRL list.</em> <br><br>  Personally, I think this is a good way to start developing the first game. <br><br>  Probably the most famous XRL is DoomRL.  After receiving a warning letter from Zenimax for using the trademark, it is now officially called simply DRL. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/199/5e8/3f2/1995e83f2e00615fa3aca2f89ba9e093.png"></div><br>  <em>DoomRL / DRL</em> <br><br>  <em>Note: keep in mind that you need to be careful with companies that are particularly loving litigation, for example Nintendo (I highly recommend not taking roguelike on Pokemon!), But overall roguelike is a very niche genre, imperceptible for copyright holders, so for the XRL hobby project it‚Äôs quite will do.</em>  <em>Only those that get significant fame can cause problems, but by this point you can either re-brand the game with your own content, or you will have enough experience to start everything from scratch.</em>  <em>XRLs are usually short-lived, small-scale training projects, but many XRLs have been in development for a long time.</em>  <em>(Be that as it may, forget about any attempts to capitalize on other people's intellectual property!)</em> <br><br>  Now DoomRL developer Cornel Kiselevich is actively working on DoomRL's successor called <a href="https://jupiterhell.com/" title="Jupiter Hell website">Jupiter Hell</a> .  A great example of how to build a huge fan base with XRL and then use their support to create an even larger commercial roguelike. <br><br>  Earlier, Cornell created two other XRLs: AliensRL (one of the first roguelike I've played) and DiabloRL. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31d/2be/d9b/31d2bed9b27f01bc37a4653364e86934.png"></div><br>  <em>AliensRL</em> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/957/eb6/c5e/957eb6c5e1b844905229a92c4baa60b7.png"></div><br>  <em>DiabloRL</em> <br><br>  Productive roguelike developer <a href="http://slashie.net/" title="Slashie.net">Slashie</a> created roguelike based on Castlevania, Metroid, Zelda, Star Wars, Megaman, and probably a dozen more franchises that we haven‚Äôt been told about: P <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/34d/815/acf/34d815acfb53eb8becf1f45c62688079.png"></div><br>  <em>Collection XRL Slashie.</em> <br><br>  Even my own semi-roguelike project XCOMRL falls into this category.  It is based on the first UFO Defense, and began with IP and the mechanic, who were well known to me and loved by me. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/68c/2c9/47e/68c2c947e08de59e8085eb1f4700161f.png"></div><br>  <em>X @ COM</em> <br><br>  On this foundation, I could develop further and add many of my mechanics and content, experimenting on top of a solid foundation. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d80/395/8e8/d803958e879f5537491802f84df77d56.png"></div><br>  <em>Modified X @ COM cards, part of which is a transition to a universe completely different from X-Com.</em> <br><br>  Another major advantage of XRL is that you immediately have fans - other people who like roguelike and your chosen IP.  And it helps a lot motivation, because there will always be people supporting you.  A lot of my supporters today are the same people who followed my work on X @ COM. <br><br><h1>  Long Term Tips </h1><br>  Here are some tips that will help you not to give up in work on a long project ... <br><br><h2>  Release releases immediately and frequently. </h2><br>  ‚ÄúFast and frequent releases‚Äù is a roguelike mantra.  You need to quickly achieve the minimum playable state of the game, that is, to assemble a prototype.  Thanks to this, you will most likely be able to get good feedback, which is very useful for the future. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b18/a70/e59/b18a70e59579c16c67985ab29adb1ae2.png"></div><br>  <em>The history of announcements of releases on RogueBasin.</em> <br><br><h2>  Sharing Saturday </h2><br>  Even before the first release, with only the concept, or after it, try participating in our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/search%3Fq%3Dtitle%253A%2522Sharing%2BSaturday%2522%2BOR%2Btitle%253A%2522Screenshot%2BSaturday%2522%26amp%3Brestrict_sr%3Don%26amp%3Bsort%3Dnew%26amp%3Bt%3Dall" title="r / RoguelikeDev Sharing Saturday">weekly collaborative posts</a> in the RoguelikeDev subreddit. <br><br>  For some, this is a good way to self-discipline, as well as a great opportunity to share what you have.  You can literally just write that this week you have been flooded with work and you have done almost nothing, and in the process of communication you can find friends who have the same problems.  Or you can talk about a cool new feature that you have added or are thinking about.  Or share funny bugs.  Yes, in fact, you can do anything!  This is a great community. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/681/9bc/1c0/6819bc1c0be378087d738799c96b4103.png"></div><br>  <em>Come and share with us!</em> <br><br><h2>  Keep a blog </h2><br>  In addition to Sharing Saturday, it is also a good idea to concentrate all the information about the development of your project in one place.  In accessible to all place.  In fact, blogging has many advantages;  Here is a list of the most important: <br><br><ul><li>  he allows you to bring thoughts in order </li><li>  study your work from a different angle </li><li>  document the process </li><li>  create useful prospect reference materials </li><li>  get feedback </li><li>  build a community around the project </li></ul><br>  I've been doing this for a while now and find the blog incredibly useful.  Below is a list of topics that I have disclosed in my blog over several years: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/750/b32/e52/750b32e529dd7425684a04534cf61993.png"></div><br>  <em>Five years of blogging at Grid Sage Games.</em> <br><br>  Perhaps there you will find useful information that is waiting for you. <br><br><h2>  Accessibility is important </h2><br>  Accessibility is important.  Traditionally this did not apply to roguelike, but today, if we make an effort, we can reach a much larger audience.  By effort, I mean sufficient documentation, a tutorial, full mouse support, tileset, etc ... <br><br>  To understand how valuable mouse and tileset support can be, take a look at the player statistics from Cogmind: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/110/826/3d1/1108263d18602b3528c358c9629a7b1f.png"></div><br>  <em>Cogmind player preferences: mouse and tile advantage!</em> <br><br>  Consider that some aspects of the accessibility of the game must be taken into account in the design from the very beginning, but for the first roguelike this is not worth it.  Just start with ASCII and keyboard controls. <br><br><h1>  Start </h1><br>  This is the end of my article and the beginning of your great new roguelike. <br><br>  Get started! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/428620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/428620/</a></p>
