  <section class="page js-page"><h1>DIY projection screen</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Numerous participation in various exhibitions prompted me to think that it is necessary to think of a way to constantly attract visitors to the exhibition stand in some unusual way.  A certain amount of brain stress and a trip to your favorite hozmag suggested an interesting idea.  As a result, we make an unusual projection screen. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  What do we need? </h5><br>  As I told in one of my previous <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/226657/">posts</a> , the hozmag is a great place for an amateur to do something interesting.  So this time - we will buy everything you need in the department of furniture accessories <br><br>  <i>1. Corner joints 90 gr.</i>  <i>- 4 things.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. Connecting sleeve - 2 pcs.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3. Fasteners for crocodile glass - 11 pcs.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>4. "T" shaped leg - 2 pcs.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>5. Vertical bar (nickel-plated tube) - length 180 cm - 2 pcs.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>6. Horizontal bar (nickel-plated tube) - length 120 cm - 2 pcs.</i> <br><br>  In the photo you can see all these details.  The "T" shaped legs are already connected to the vertical rods by two connecting bushes. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b05/92a/8c9/b0592a8c961a58c956910bc8cea72b3a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Also for the assembly will need two hexagons 4 and 6 mm.  It is clear that the rods are sold at three meters.  In any store, you can immediately cut off the details of the desired length with a hacksaw.  This is probably the only "fitter" in this case)

    <h5>  Assembly of the metal frame </h5><br>  Skilfully wielding hexagons we connect the structure together and set it on its feet.  It should turn out as in the photo.  We lightly fasten eight ‚Äúcrocodiles‚Äù along the perimeter, but for the time being we do not tighten it too much. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f8f/508/4ca/f8f5084cac4aa98e4f8815f085988a3e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In order not to check the length of the structure and joints every time, put small marks with a strong marker.  It is very convenient. <br><br><h5>  "We stretch" the screen </h5><br>  A feature of this design is actually the screen itself.  It is made of matte plexiglass, in which puzzles are cut, as shown in this photo.  The screen consists of four such parts, which are held in the frame "crocodiles". <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/381/6ba/1ed/3816ba1ed9bcc7b995d0a93d6a89e7bc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For the manufacture of the screen used laser cutting.  Putting the design together, combining adjacent puzzles and align, so that there are no large gaps. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac9/6bf/dd4/ac96bfdd4f74497514c5bc2a7e89807f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We tighten "crocodiles" with a hexagon, but without special efforts.  Details and so beautifully kept.  The design also includes a shelf for promotional materials, which is attached to the remaining three ‚Äúcrocodiles‚Äù.  I also recommend to buy two or three "crocodile" in reserve.  We had a case of breakdown.  Burst jaw in Chinese "crocodile" in warm Russian hands with a strong tightening) <br><br><h5>  Why puzzles and how it all works? </h5><br>  Many have probably already guessed that the screen is used for the projection of presentations and videos from a multimedia projector.  The projector is installed at the back of the screen and works to the light.  At the same time in the setting of the projector, you must specify the mirror mode broadcast.  Thus, the projector is hidden from the viewer and it seems that a thin plasma screen is working.  However, this is not all.  The projector constantly creates beautiful highlights, as the light penetrates through the slits of the puzzles.  These rays fall on the walls, passing at the exhibition of people on the floor, etc.  and immediately arouse interest and attention.  At the same time, a noticeable effect extends to 2-4 meters and does not interfere with the other exhibitors.  We use a 3000 lumen projector that ‚Äúattacks‚Äù the screen even in strong light, creating a great contrast image.  In the dark, the device and puzzle glare act simply fascinating.  The shape of the screen in the form of puzzles are particularly positive for people.  Something in them is spiritual.  From childhood) <br><br><h5>  Well, well, what about the physics? </h5><br>  When this screen was created, we did not expect the occurrence of diffraction effects, which do not allow photographing the screen on a camera or on a professional camera.  The image starts to sparkle with all the colors of the rainbow.  Man does not see this.  The screen "deceives" the digital matrix.  The diffraction effect occurs at the interface of the optical media on the puzzles.  The photo shows the same slide from different angles to the screen.  The background of the original slide is gray.  It looks unusual. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/26a/581/afc/26a581afc07d44be0cc100caf066004e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Summing up </h5><br>  The device turned out with a diagonal of 150 cm. You can make the screen bigger, but this also created just a great effect at exhibitions.  It was ridiculous - sometimes people asked more about the screen than about our products.  The price of the whole structure is about 100 dollars.  The projector, of course, is not included in the price) I will not bore readers with additional details and subtleties, but they are still there.  The most important thing is the features and optical parameters of plexiglass.  In this <a href="https://files.webmoney.ru/files/kdFdOjxO/link">file</a> (PDF 35 kB) anyone can read more about this.  The file also contains a link to the Plexiglas pattern for laser cutting. <br><br>  Of course, I attach the <a href="http://youtu.be/wMO4cPmsjTE">video</a> .  At the beginning of the video you can see the diffraction distortion of the screen. <br><br>  Have a nice day, everyone! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228121/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228121/</a></p>
