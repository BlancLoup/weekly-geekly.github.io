Part 1</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f6/5e5/6fc/7f65e56fcccf42069f6e3d40818ae7c2.jpg" align="left"><br>  Landing page is quite an important part of a marketing company, with its help a potential client will learn about your product.  Therefore, we decided to share the article by Peep Laja about why the selling pages are critical, and what components need to work to create an effective landing page.  Below is the first part of the article, in which the author reflects on the reasons for creating failed landing pages and gives their examples.  The article is written in the first person.  For comparison, we also picked up a couple of examples of high-quality landing pages. <br><br>  <b>Was there a landing page?</b> <br><br>  You've come across long selling pages?  Yes, everything is detailed on them, but in most cases their efficiency leaves much to be desired: low quality of work makes these pages less attractive for the target audience. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Long selling pages are used in internet marketing because sometimes they really work.

      The goal of your website is to sell products or services.  If you sell only one product, you do not need to have more than one page.  Your website informs consumers about your product (or service), its advantages and use options.  This helps them make a purchasing decision, in case your product is able to quickly solve their problem.  If for this you have to go several times from one page to another, it only hinders. <br><br>  Someone calls the selling pages "mini-sites", someone - "business cards", stuck the name "landing pages".  The essence is the same. <br><br>  <b>Text does not happen much?</b> <br><br>  The amount of text required on the sales pages depends on the complexity and cost of the product.  The more complex / expensive your product is, the more you need to explain, show and influence a potential client. <br><br>  If you sell a box of matches for 25 cents, I, as a buyer, do not need a lot of text.  This product is simple and cheap. <br><br>  An example of a successful landing page with a minimum of text: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/089/963/e25/089963e252304cbf97ea0a2096e9c46a.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://humanwrit.es/"><i>View full version</i></a> <br><br>  On the other hand, if I choose a new car or house for myself, then in this case both products are complex (when buying, you need to know a lot of information) and expensive ones, so I will need several months to make a purchasing decision. <br><br>  An example of a successful landing with a description of a complex product: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/723/0e5/687/7230e56870194f2e9538ea5ecd99562e.jpg"><br>  <a href="https://www.shoplocket.com/"><i>View full version</i></a> <br><br>  If you sell something worth, say, $ 300, then your buyer does not need to think long, but it requires a certain amount of information to explain this purchase to someone (to himself, his wife, boss, etc.). <br><br>  <b>Buyers, they are readers</b> <br><br>  Are you worried that your text is too long?  Not worth it.  If there are those who agree to buy your product, having read only about 20% of the information you provide, all the better, they simply scroll the page to the end in search of the ‚Äúbuy‚Äù button.  No problem. <br><br>  But if one of the potential buyers reads the entire text, and after that he still has questions, then you have a problem.  This is an excellent argument in favor of long landings. <br><br>  Of course, most people will not read the text completely, and this is completely normal.  This is not a novel.  And those who are still fully acquainted with the information on the selling page - this is your potential customers. <br><br>  <b>But after all, the long selling pages are so banal and completely unreliable!</b> <br><br>  It is for this reason that I said that their effectiveness leaves much to be desired.  I agree - most of the selling pages are really ridiculously monotonous and are aimed at fooling potential customers.  Therefore, so many people have a negative attitude towards them. <br><br>  I selected a few random products and analyzed their selling pages. <br><br>  Here are three typical forms: <br>  Randomno example ‚Ññ1: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2c/e4f/b1c/e2ce4fb1c4e74a8b8b385d8988e2eefc.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://first100steps.com/sample-page/"><i>View full version</i></a> <br><br>  Exclamation marks!  There is.  Aggressive advertising!  There is.  Absolute leader in the market!  There is.  This product should scatter like hot cakes (in case you think so - this does not happen). <br><br>  Randomny example number 2: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3d9/ef6/6b1/3d9ef66b16524258b7e54ec3a36a28ad.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://jobgettingformula.com/eBook.htm"><i>View full version</i></a> <br>  They could not even properly place their logo and make a readable headline. <br><br>  Randomny example number 3: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/441/96a/5b9/44196a5b99804a42a696429cb806e764.jpg"><br>  <a href="http://veganvalor.com/the-pythagorean-plan/"><i>View full version</i></a> <br>  Another case of "effective" header. <br><br>  <b>The cruel truth about landings</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Most of them look pathetic.  And this is putting it mildly. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The text on the page is often written, frankly, by idiots who believe that adding exclamation marks and appeals to each sentence increases sales. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Information on a variety of products posted on the same page does not look convincing and does not provide a clear picture.  What could be simpler than creating a pdf document and using it everywhere? <br><br>  If you start looking for examples of long selling pages, you will surely stumble upon a lot of critical articles about them, but you will also see that they are mainly criticized for their quality of work. <br><br>  The point is not in the format of a long page, but in the performance, which often "kills" even good commercial proposals. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Long selling pages may look great. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Finding someone who will write great texts for them is real. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Interesting and complex products can be sold through landings, and this is not only IT products. <br><br>  Here is a long selling page that inspires confidence and looks tempting, and this is not an IT product. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/88a/02a/b01/88a02ab015d14ca9ad9306b26a0c1a5a.jpg"><br>  <a href=""><i>View full version</i></a> <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://conversionxl.com/how-to-design-kickass-long-form-sales-pages/">http://conversionxl.com/how-to-design-kickass-long-form-sales-pages/#/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/232733/">https://habr.com/ru/post/232733/</a></p>
