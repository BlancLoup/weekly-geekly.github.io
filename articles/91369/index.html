  <section class="page js-page"><h1>From the periphery to the center - why?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introduction </h4><br><br>  From time to time the topic of education is discussed on Habr√©.  Much has been said about metropolitan and regional universities, opinions have been expressed, copies have been broken.  But I want to talk about a phenomenon close to this topic - about the flow of students and specialists from the regions to metropolitan educational institutions, that is, why we are running (or trying to escape) from our homeland in search of better work and education. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Start, rainbow </h4><br>  My life and studies began like that of 99.9% of people who entered university ‚Äî 11 classes of school, then the unified state examination, the submission of documents, and, finally, it is the first course.  I want to note that of the two universities in my city (the second largest city in the Khabarovsk Territory) I chose a technical one, and went to the specialty Mathematical Software and Information Systems Administration (the output specialty is a mathematician-programmer), at that time an experimental (The Unified State Exam was still experimental, rather complicated, the passing point for this discipline was 171). <br>  The first semester passed ‚Äúwith a bang‚Äù - a new, interesting, excellent teaching of mathematical disciplines, relatively interesting humanitarian subjects.  The second semester began and ... complete disappointment in special disciplines.

    <h4>  Disappointment </h4><br>  Programming (C \ C ++) was led by my grandfather under 70, I can‚Äôt say anything bad about him as a person, but, unfortunately, he was a good specialist 20 years ago, apparently about then he finished mastering new techniques and monitoring progress in programming.  Classic BC 6, complete rejection of modern development tools, the use of third-party libraries, etc.  and, worst of all, 2 semesters for 2 languages! <br>  It was believed that a person knows C \ C ++, if he is able to draw a window with a button, by clicking on which in the adjacent text field the result of a simple mathematical solution will appear. <br>  It made a negative impression on me, which is still strong. <br>  Then it began - 2 semesters of the MathCAD of the ancient version, programming on VB in MS Excel - 2 semesters, Assembler (perhaps the only subject that was interesting, but told just terribly) - 2 semesters. <br>  Starting from the second year of study, I got a job, after six months I went to the provider by the system administrator at the central office.  knot (self-education, thank you!). <br>  He transferred to the evening, did not force himself to learn, a year later he transferred to correspondence, a crust is needed.  Now completely gone.  I am preparing for the move. <br><br>  I did not finish my studies.  Maybe he was a bad student, he was sloppy and did not wait for interesting undergraduates.  But it seems that is not the case. <br>  Life story - I'm leaving my current job, throwing a message about a possible vacancy on one of the local communities (system administrator with a bias in the database).  I read comments from people who studied with me and successfully, practically finished with a red diploma - ‚ÄúOf the first half of the requirements, most are not even familiar.‚Äù  But there were only words like nginx, postgres and php-fpm.  And no tsiska (even) smells. <br>  The theory is confirmed by my girlfriend, who completed this year the specialty with which I left. <br>  There was nothing to wait on senior courses.  All that was taught - superficially with fully synthetic tasks.  About the organization of work, types and mechanisms of testing, programming patterns, repositories, bug trackers and many more things have not been said.  In general, leaving the institute, the man turned out to be completely unprepared for the modern realities of work.  Not to mention the lack of qualifications. <br><br><h4>  Instead of an epilogue </h4><br><br>  I would like the best here.  Better education, interesting work, decent wages.  But, now, will have to leave.  Just because here is the ceiling.  More interesting posts than I have now, I will not find, it simply does not exist, because IT is half-dead (honestly, I watched half a vacancy and walked around the whole city).  Well, there will be no one here to do anything interesting, no money and no commercial necessity. <br>  I think and get an education in the west. <br>  A smart person does not go somewhere because they just want to.  It's just interesting there.  Much more interesting than here, with options for work and the possibility of self-realization.  The rest is from the evil one. <br>  I wish everything changed.  But this edge is not visible. <br><br>  Well, the question to the Habrasoobshchestvu  Why did you leave if you left? <br>  <b>ADD:</b> In the role of explanation.  With work here for the most part the same trouble.  Very limited opportunities for career growth and the lack of development of professional development (due to the almost dead labor market in this area), motivated by work, and not by their own goals.  Education is only a reflection of the general level. <br>  <b>ADD2:</b> The essence of the topic is not in the discussion precisely of my student days, which have long passed, but rather on the issue of the migration of specialists and talented people in general closer to the center of Russia or abroad in general.  The rest is written only in the role of my impressions of past years connected with the specialty and one more motivation of me to go away from here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91369/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91369/</a></p>
