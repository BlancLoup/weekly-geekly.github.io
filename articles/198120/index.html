  <section class="page js-page"><h1>So that you live on donate!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Again raised a howl about evil copyright holders.  Now the reason was that Lopukhov soldered for 4 years conditionally, and on the way to them civil claims for damages.  On these poor things, everyone, in general, doesn‚Äôt give a damn, and the reason for the howling was the amount of damage claimed by the prosecution - 38 billion rubles.  And it began again - the price must be fair, affordable, adequate;  there is no need to feed the copywriters, it is necessary to donate the authors;  Down dvd, give digital distribution (for a fair price, of course). <br><br>  Since I rarely watch movies, and if I watch them, it‚Äôs either in the cinema or on TV ‚Äî the problems of Hollywood and Mikhalkov do not bother me much.  Because the conversation goes about the movies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I read a lot of books and follow the authors' experiments.  I don‚Äôt have a cozy three-story house in a quiet place with a dedicated library, so I rarely buy books in paper.  My choice is an electronic copy.  For me it is important that books in electronic form be available. <br><br><h4>  1. Price </h4><br>  In general, in a market economy, where homo homini lupus est (or if to paraphrase this famous Latinism - wow, wow, wow <sup>3</sup> ), the sacred right of the manufacturer to sell his work for any amount he likes.  Not fair, not adequate, not fair - any.  Because all the arguments such as the standard of living, wages, taxes, etc.  can be discarded as insolvent.  The seller has the right to charge any amount for his goods.

      On the other hand, the consumer has the right not to pay this amount.  So that they do not start giving me an example of a monopoly: the book is not a commodity, you can live without it.  14% of the world's population cannot read at all, and nothing, they live and reproduce. <br><br>  It is obvious that the participants want a few different things and try to move the price in different directions: one to zero, the other to plus-infinity.  When, as a result, the amount that the buyer is willing to pay is equal to the amount for which the seller is ready to sell, everyone begins to live, if not happily, then more or less peacefully.  If the meeting does not occur - the seller simply ceases to release the goods, and the goods disappear from the market, often together with the seller.  From this part of the buyers, whom the high price suited, grieve, but there is nothing to be done. <br><br>  With the advent of numbers in our daily lives, the price of copying began to tend to zero.  Producers of information content have lost the main protection of their investments in the means of production.  Obviously, they have two ways: to leave the market or to meet the buyer.  They don‚Äôt want to take their market without a fight, hence the largely idiotic criminal and civil trials.  To meet the buyer like trying because  Buying an e-book is no longer a problem, but the numbers, which will be further in the text, indicate that the buyer is not ready to take the counter step.  From this, similarly, there are largely idiotic laws, criminal and civil cases. <br><br><h4>  2. Crowdfunding and donates </h4><br>  In the book industry (even in Russia, and examples will be Russian) there are examples of successful crowdfunding and donate.  Nevertheless, according to my personal observations, they work only for authors who have already been promoted by classical methods. <br><br>  Let us leave aside the artistic and aesthetic value of the works of the authors, which I will cite as an example - the taste and color of all markers are different.  And if you do not like a particular author, this does not mean that your loved one will have different results.  If there is a wish to add the tables - send the results, add. <br><br><h6>  2.1 Crowdfunding </h6><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  author </th><th>  request </th><th>  collection </th><th>  term </th><th>  donors </th><th>  avg  circulation <sup>1</sup> </th></tr><tr><td>  Nick Perumov <br>  <a href="http://boomstarter.ru/projects/51681/lemeh_i_borozda">project</a> </td><td>  100'000 </td><td>  290'000 </td><td>  1 month </td><td>  1'390 </td><td>  70'000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Sergey Lukyanenko <br>  <a href="http://dr-piliulkin.livejournal.com/232808.html">start</a> and <a href="http://dr-piliulkin.livejournal.com/233826.html">end of the</a> project </td><td>  - </td><td>  6,400 </td><td>  3 days </td><td>  2'640 </td><td>  200'000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Sergey Tarmashev <br>  <a href="http://vk.com/official_tarmashev_club%3Fw%3Dwall-5904705_87683%252Fall">project</a> </td><td>  1'000'000 </td><td>  900'000 </td><td>  1 year </td><td>  360 </td><td>  25'000 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <i>The amount of Lukyanenko so small, because</i>  <i>he simply counted how many people were willing to send the ruble for his story, which he would put in open access, the amount was typed somewhat higher because</i>  <i>terminals do not accept coins.</i>  <i>The fundraising announcement saw at least 55'000 people.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In addition to the electronic version, Tarmashev will have a printed version that all donors will receive.</i> <br><br>  As you can see, Perumov turned out to be a more or less successful undertaking: the average donation is comparable to the cost of an electronic card and the number of project participants exceeded 1% of the average circulation. <br><br><h6>  2.2 Donate and sale of electronic copies </h6><br><table><tbody><tr><th>  author </th><th>  donate </th><th>  eBooks </th><th>  avg  circulation <sup>1</sup> </th></tr><tr><td>  Boris Gromov <br></td><td>  6'000 </td><td>  0 </td><td>  10'000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Sergey Lukyanenko ( <a href="http://dr-piliulkin.livejournal.com/341315.html">inf</a> ) </td><td>  450'000 </td><td>  66'000 </td><td>  200'000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Sergey Tarmashev </td><td>  2'700 ( <a href="http://tarmashev.com/index.php%3Fp%3Dob">inf</a> ) </td><td>  33'000 ( <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_embedded%26v%3DJBCsl9167PU">info</a> ) </td><td>  25'000 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <i>The results are taken for different periods, and are given for ease of comparison by month (by dividing or multiplying) excluding royalties of stores (which can reach 75%) and commissions of payment systems (can reach 15%).</i> <br><br>  Only Lukyanenko has a decent result, but this is the best-selling science fiction writer in Russia with the largest circulations.  The rest of the indicators on income are not very similar. <br>  The most indicative of Tarmashev, because  The wallet has been working for more than 4 years. <br><br><h4>  3. Digital distribution </h4><br>  Since the sales statistics of legal electronic copies are nowhere to take (and the previous tablet shows that they are even negligible in absolute numbers), we compare the print runs with downloads on one known resource (on the second, the numbers are the same). <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  author </th><th>  n  circulation </th><th>  n  download <sup>2</sup> </th></tr><tr><td>  Andrei Cruz </td><td>  25'000 </td><td>  53'000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Boris Gromov </td><td>  10'000 </td><td>  29'000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Vadim Panov </td><td>  70'000 </td><td>  41'000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Victor Pelevin </td><td>  140'000 </td><td>  34'000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Nick Perumov </td><td>  70'000 </td><td>  23'000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Sergey Lukyanenko </td><td>  200'000 </td><td>  61'000 </td></tr><tr><td>  Sergey Tarmashev </td><td>  25'000 </td><td>  35'000 </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  It is not possible to build the intersections of sets of downloaded, having a legal copy, reading one page and abandoning, not paying essentially for anything.  Nevertheless, it is noticeable to the naked eye - the higher the circulation, the less ‚Äúharmful‚Äù the network libraries.  And it is possible that the well-known authors even claim that network distribution is an additional advertisement. <br><br>  The less known the author, the greater the negative impact of online libraries.  So, publishers will have to cut investment in new authors who have ceased to fight back.  But as a new author to become famous without cash injections (in advertising), I personally do not understand.  If anyone knows - tell us, we laugh together. <br><br><h4>  <s>4. Conclusion</s> </h4><br>  No, now in the context of the copyright "conclusion" sounds extremely ambiguous. <br><br><h4>  4. Extreme section </h4><br>  At the very beginning, I paid your attention to the fact that we live under capitalism.  Unprofitable products will leave the market.  This is neither good nor bad, it is the law of the existing social system.  In the end, in our country so many classics have been written, which are already in the public domain, which was enough for a couple of revolutions, and for me dreary evenings will suffice even more so. <br><br>  As an epilogue, I will insert a quote by Boris Gromov, on the topic Coping is not theft: <br><blockquote>  It's just that people transfer money to a wallet too.  But it is difficult to call it income: for the entire existence of the wallet - a little more than 12 thousand rubles.  Of these, more than a third are translations for an audiobook, which reader Dmitry Khazanovich and I tried to officially sell on the Web.  It did not burn out: the book was already laid out on Rutreker four and a half hours after the start of sales, and after that sales, as it is not difficult to guess, stopped.  There are only downloads from Rutreker, of which there are many, but there is no income. </blockquote><br><br>  <b>Reference Information.</b> <br><ol><li>  How was the calculation of the average circulation. <br>  Any book store or catalog opened and up to 10 books of the author were taken. </li><li>  How to calculate the average download. <br>  Statistics was taken downloading books (large works published by individual books, correlate stories with collections of unrealistic). </li><li>  Victor Pelevin.
