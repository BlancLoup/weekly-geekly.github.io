  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How do I formally "rein in" Intel SpeedStep</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, dear habrazhiteli.  3 months ago I was faced with the fact that my new laptop did not consider advertising and anti-advertising, Lenovo y570 (4gb ram, Intel Core I3 2330m, gt555m 1gb, Windows 7 Corporate x64) terribly slowed down even in not very demanding games.  I myself am far from being a fan of various ‚Äúshooters and racers‚Äù, but sometimes I want to relax or just see what your device is capable of.  I tried a lot of different drivers for Intel and Nvidia video cards, as well as drivers for the motherboard chipset.  A couple of times carried the laptop to the service, but they said that there was no damage. <br><br>  Interested in or faced with a similar problem?  Then I ask under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It all started with the fact that once I, tired of the routine of university life, decided to relax a little for some computer game with a fascinating storyline.  But I was disappointed.  None of the modern games that I had available even started.  Began to understand.  It turned out the whole thing in the switchable graphics (Still, sometimes it‚Äôs worth reading a bunch of paper applied to household appliances).  I figured it out pretty quickly.  in the Nvidia Control Panel configured everything as I wanted.  So, sitting comfortably behind my laptop in anticipation of complete relaxation and detachment from worldly vanity, I decided to start with something from the past.  He took out a dusty box with the words Far Cry, installed it and plunged into the process of the game.  But something was different than what I expected.  The picture twitched and sometimes faded.  Grieving, I began to sin on modern drivers.  Well, Reluctantly, I took out another box with the words Mass Effect on it.  I repeated the same actions as with the previous game.  Everything was exactly the same, though lags and friezes were somewhat more serious.  To clear my conscience, I turned Fraps on and fell into total dismay - 26 FPS with periodic drawdowns of up to 15?  I packed up and went to a friend who bragged about the NFS Shift 2 collection edition. I installed ... Alas, but the picture repeated.  Sinful thing I thought that the cooling system can not cope.  But my fears were not confirmed: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b2b/6aa/5fa/b2b6aa5fa58ca770fa23791771b78583.png" alt="image">

Drinking hot tea while sitting in a comfortable chair, I decided to look for a solution on the Internet.  I looked through dozens of pages in various forums.  Changed more than a dozen packages of various drivers, both official from Lenovo, and from Nvidia.  And lo and behold!  It would seem that I found a solution to my problem.  Some comrades advised in the advanced power plan settings to set the maximum processor state to 99%.  As it turned out, the second-generation Turbo Bust on the Intel Core ix sometimes does not behave very well.  To celebrate, I quickly got to dig in the settings ... Stop!  My stone does not support Turbo Boost.  My state at that moment is difficult to convey a couple of lines.  I firmly decided that the next day I would go to the SC and let them understand.  So did. <br>  The guys in the SC got calm and patient.  After carefully listening to all my claims have taken the unit.  They said that in 2 weeks everything will be ready anyway.  With peace of mind, I went home.  Three days later they called me and said that no damage had been found, that everything was in order.  But I was determined.  The next day, I took the laptop to another regional center and delivered it there.  But the story repeated.  Having consulted with a lawyer, I realized that I would not return the money.  In complete despair, I went home frailously.  So it took 3 months.  I tried not to remember my failure with a new purchase, but it was not so easy.  After all, I bought a laptop on my first salary.  One day, a feeling of resentment overcame me, and I decided to solve this problem at any cost.  By any means.  I decided to do an exclusive analysis: first, I removed the version with a faulty HDD (with a completely new hard drive, the problem did not disappear), from the defective RAM, even the drive extracted it for the purity of the experiment.  So, we still have 3 finalists: the power supply, the graphics processor and the central processor.  To test the power supply, I didn‚Äôt have the right tools to check, and I‚Äôm not the only one with such a problem in the world, so I‚Äôve dismissed this option with a creak to my soul, but I still didn‚Äôt. <br><br>  There are 2 candidates left: CPU and GP.  First I decided to check the GP.  Took 3 test packages: 3DMark06, 3DMark11 and FurMark. <br>  the latter, by the way, I never wound up.  As a result of several tests, I got the following results: 3DMark11 - 1290P and 3DMark06 5601. Oops!  This is already interesting.  I compared it with the reference table (link at the end of the topic) and I realized that it‚Äôs not just the results of 3Dmark06 that are almost 2 times lower than normal.  This is a clue.  To clear my conscience I spent the whole evening experimenting with the drivers, but nothing has changed.  Began to think: Mark 11 uses the DX11, and 06 DX9, it means (an absolutely crazy idea) Mark 11 does not load the CPU so much as 06. So the point is in the processor.  Began to monitor it in various games.  It turned out that periodically the frequency falls from 2.2 to 0.8 GHz.  He began to dig into the plans of power supply, set the minimum power state of the processor by 99%.  Did not help.  The frequency still jumped.  The problem, I tell you, was not easy.  wrapped in a rug, I began to wander around the Internet again.  I looked through all the technologies that were used in my processor, but somehow I could not turn them off.  By the way, the BIOS has such a small list of settings that I was even surprised.  I did not dare flashing the BIOS on a newer version, warranty and all that.  I do not remember how much time has passed, but suddenly I poked the mouse cursor: <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/software/windows_7_power">here</a> <br>  A very interesting article (for the lazy, it tells how to include additional settings in the power supply plans using the registry).  Here is a record made me think: <br><br><pre><code class="php hljs">[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">54533251</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-82</span></span>be<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-4824</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-96</span></span>c1<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-47</span></span>b60b740d00\<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">0</span></span>cc5b647-c1df<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-4637</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-891</span></span>a-dec35c318583] <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Attributes"</span></span>=dword:<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">00000000</span></span> [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">54533251</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-82</span></span>be<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-4824</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-96</span></span>c1<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-47</span></span>b60b740d00\<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">3</span></span>b04d4fd<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-1</span></span>cc7<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-4</span></span>f23-ab1c-d1337819c4bb] <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Attributes"</span></span>=dword:<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">00000000</span></span> [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">54533251</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-82</span></span>be<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-4824</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-96</span></span>c1<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-47</span></span>b60b740d00\<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">5</span></span>d76a2ca-e8c0<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-402</span></span>f-a133<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-2158492</span></span>d58ad] <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Attributes"</span></span>=dword:<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">00000000</span></span> [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">54533251</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-82</span></span>be<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-4824</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-96</span></span>c1<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-47</span></span>b60b740d00\a55612aa-f624<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-42</span></span>c6-a443<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-7397</span></span>d064c04f] <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Attributes"</span></span>=dword:<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">00000000</span></span> [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">54533251</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-82</span></span>be<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-4824</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-96</span></span>c1<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-47</span></span>b60b740d00\ea062031<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-0e34</span></span><span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-4</span></span>ff1<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-9</span></span>b6d-eb1059334028] <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"Attributes"</span></span>=dword:<span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">00000000</span></span></code> </pre> <br><br>  And then it dawned on me, why not turn on all the settings related to the power of the processor?  Perhaps there I will be able to prohibit the reduction of frequency in idle time.  And I was right.  Having corrected the registry entries, I saw this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1df/22d/3e1/1df22d3e189512d7c843fda91ca77d8b.png" alt="image"><br>  My joy knew no bounds.  By the way, there are much more settings than there are in the screenshot.  And each setting has its own tooltips.  Perhaps I will simply list the optimal parameters that I have chosen empirically: <br><br><ul><li>  Minimum number of cores in idle state - 50% </li><li>  Threshold of decrease in processor performance - 20% </li><li>  CPU Upgrade Policy - Reactive </li><li>  The threshold for reducing the idle state - 25% </li></ul><br><br>  I want to note that it is better to try various settings yourself.  Only I immediately warn you - there may be problems with overheating.  So always keep an eye on the temperature. <br><br>  Well, that's all I wanted to share with you today.  I apologize for the manner of presentation of the article, I just really wanted to convey all that I felt in these situations.  I sincerely hope that this article will be useful to someone, because there are a lot of similar cases with the i3 processor.  And now I bow out and hurry to please my friends in misfortune.
