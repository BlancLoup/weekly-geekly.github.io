For example, not so long ago we <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/278450/">talked</a> about unusual acoustic systems.  There was also a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/audiomania/blog/276696/">post</a> about unusual instruments of electronic musicians. <br><br>  Today I would like to dwell on audio technologies that are just preparing to enter the market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Every day, people around the world come to mind amazing ideas that they seek to bring to life.  The creators of these projects study target markets, write business plans and make great efforts to implement them.  However, not all reach the goal.  Many audio projects are either closed or absorbed by larger Internet companies.

      The main problem of such startups is music licensing.  Rights holders require fabulous royalties that can not afford the newly formed companies.  Labels are constantly trying to raise the price of music.  First, there was a ‚Äúshowdown‚Äù with Apple, because the company <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story%3Fid%3D6651596">refused</a> to sell music at more than $ 0.99, then ‚Äúunder the distribution‚Äù <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20070304/223155.shtml">got</a> Pandora and other streaming services. <br><br>  Technical startups engaged in the development of audio equipment and building applications are spared from licensing difficulties.  Today there are many such projects on the market. <br><br>  For example, some of them were covered at the Midem festival held in France.  In 2016, prizes were awarded to projects such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DfcSVKwNrhis">Mimi Hearing</a> , an application that adapts music to the user's auditory features.  The program automatically changes the volume and adjusts the equalizer so that no sound escapes the listener. <br><br>  Also the project <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Flist%3DPL8828QLbgLTpOt5ktFhbWdNQqSi_SovAk%26time_continue%3D1%26v%3D3zQf7xEOP7M">Stagelink</a> was noted.  This program is for communication of fans with their idols.  Thanks to her, producers can estimate where the performer is most awaited and schedule their performances.  The project was launched in Germany in 2014 and has already gathered an audience of 100 thousand fans.  During this time, tickets were sold for more than $ 500 thousand. <br><br>  Not spared, and "iron" startups.  The Swedish company Mind Music Lab has developed the Sensus guitar, equipped with various "chips".  However, what to say, take a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DfqzEQnsSIoY">look</a> . <br><br><h5>  From grants to crowdfunding </h5><br>  Obviously, it is pleasant to get the main prize in the competition, but they are rarely held, and it is not so easy to win.  Fortunately, ordinary people are ready to help in the implementation of a worthwhile idea.  Companies publish project concepts on crowdfunding platforms where users can finance the product they like.  On Kickstarter and Indiegogo, many different audio startups have been registered.  Here are some of them. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Nura Headphones</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/nura/nura-headphones-that-learn-and-adapt-to-your-uniqu%3Fref%3Dcategory_popular">The project</a> (photo at the beginning of the article) is very similar in concept to the one previously presented by Mimi Hearing, only in this case, the headphones themselves ‚Äúadapt‚Äù to the listener.  In appearance, they seem to be ordinary full-size headphones, but if you study them more closely, you will notice that they also have built-in intra channel ones. <br><br>  Intra-channel headphones broadcast high frequencies, and bass is transmitted through full-size ones.  Moreover, this structure allows for better sound insulation.  At the moment, the project has collected an amount that exceeded $ 1.8 million. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Bracelet subwoofer The Basslet</b> <br><br>  Incredible <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/basslet/the-basslet-a-wearable-subwoofer-for-your-body%3Fref%3Dcategory_popular">gadget</a> , wearing which you can enjoy the music and literally feel the low frequencies.  The project has already enlisted the support of such publications as TechCrunch, The Verge, Engadget and Highsnobiety.  The amount collected exceeded the required almost 9 times.  Developers believe that their device can change the scope of entertainment. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>MacroBoom Solar Powered Portable Speaker</b> <br><br>  This audio speaker may be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ruggedbank/macroboom-rugged-solar-bluetooth-speaker-for-audio%3Fref%3Dcategory_popular">useful for</a> avid travelers.  One of the sides of the device is fully reserved for the solar battery.  The gadget is not afraid of dust and water, has a shockproof case and is able to work up to 15 hours.  The project has already collected the necessary amount;  pre-sales will begin very soon. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>WAVES Nx 3D Headphones</b> <br><br>  According to the developers, these headphones can take you to a concert of your favorite band.  The device <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/waves/waves-nx-3d-audio-on-any-headphones%3Fref%3Dcategory_popular">tracks the</a> position of the head and creates the necessary surround sound. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Mogees play</b> <br><br>  An interesting <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mogeesplay/mogees-play-a-new-way-to-make-music-and-play-games">device</a> that turns any surface into a controller.  Attaching it, for example, to the wall and connecting it to the phone, you can turn it into a musical instrument.  For the device, several applications have been specially developed that allow you to record your own tunes. <br><br>  The gadget can also be used for practical purposes, for example, as a contactless light switch.  The gadget was shown on the Jimmy Kimmel show and received public approval. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Muzo - creates an atmosphere of calm</b> <br><br>  Attach the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1280803647/muzo-your-personal-zone-creator-with-noise-blockin%3Fref%3Dcategory_popular">device</a> to any surface (for example, a window), and it will begin to absorb all the extra vibrations in order to bring an atmosphere of calm to the house.  Muzo also has a lot of nature sounds to help you relax.  An interesting feature of the device is the ‚ÄúSecret‚Äù mode, which protects against listening and makes the speech of people in the room illegible. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Personal trainer vi</b> <br><br>  The system keeps track of all the main indicators: pulse, heartbeat, pace, speed, and even monitors the weather.  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1050572498/vi-the-first-true-artificial-intelligence-personal%3Fref%3Dhome_potd">Headphones will</a> adjust the training program in accordance with the stated requirements.  The device can also be used as a regular headset for listening to music or telephone conversations. <br><br>  The project looks promising and has already collected an amount 13 times the original one.  Entry to the market is scheduled for 2017. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Personal Translator The Pilot</b> <br><br>  Of course - this is the next step in the field of machine translation.  This <a href="http://www.boredpanda.com/real-time-translator-ear-waverly-labs/">gadget</a> is able to translate heard speech almost instantly.  This is the Babylonian fish of our time [The Babylon fish is a fictional creature from the series of fantastic works of the English writer Douglas Adams ‚ÄúThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy‚Äù that helps to translate the speech of alien races - approx.  Ed.]. <br><br>  At the moment, Pilot can work with English, French, Spanish and Italian, you just need to select the desired in the application.  Already in September of this year, the product should appear on store shelves. <br><br><hr><br>  In conclusion, I would like to note that such a variety of audio technologies is driving the industry forward.  Who knows, perhaps any of the solutions presented here will enter into our life with you and will radically change the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãsound, music and the ecosystem of audio in general.  Time will tell. <br><br>  PS Interesting materials from our blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4669.html">The basics of acoustics for teapots: types of acoustic design speakers</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4711.html">How to choose a wireless speaker</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4482.html">Wireless headphones: how to navigate in the choice?</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-4708.html">Headphones with active noise cancellation: do not hear anyone, hear nothing</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396289/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396289/</a></p>
