      Among this huge number of applications you need to take a place under the sun and not get lost in the general stream.  The application must be useful for users to satisfy their requests.  High-quality applications achieve great success, and they are much easier to promote. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Optimization above all <br></h4><br>  What is worth considering when developing.  It all starts with optimization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/85b/ad9/024/85bad9024d5598e018e4cf59f8f71806.jpg"><br><br>  1. The <b>icon of</b> your application is the first presentation.  It starts with the formation of the first impression of the user, and, as you know, you will never have a second chance to make it, so you should try to get the picture hooked on your potential consumer.  It is not enough just to put a beautiful image, it should reflect what is contained under it. <br><br>  2. Together with the icon is the <b>name of the application</b> , it should reflect what the user will receive after the jump.  It is worth taking care of the meaning of the title.  If this is not a new, but rather a well-known brand, you should definitely use it in the title.  Try to make the title include the main keyword search words. <br><br>  3. Clicked on the application in the catalog - what we see?  <b>Screenshots</b> .  Here everything should be on business, no one is interested in ordinary pictures of the application, reflect its features in the screenshots, the coolest features you have, upload promotional screenshots, draw special attention-grabbing screenshots.  Remember that every detail must sell the app.  In the Google Play store, you can add videos along with screenshots.  Take advantage of this - people like interactive. <br><br>  4. Icon hooked, screenshots bribed, take a look at the text.  <b>The description of the application</b> should be brief but concise - we reflect the features, advantages and prescribe the basic functionality.  Remember that the text should interest from the first lines.  The volume should not be large in order to be easily perceived from the mobile screen (approximately 250 characters). <br><br>  5. <b>Keywords</b> - here, again, is a place for your uniqueness, write down the words that distinguish you from everyone, but do not forget about competitors - specify those keys that will reflect the genre characteristics of the application.  Words should be separated by a comma and, avoid composite keys, the App Store, for example, simply does not perceive them.  Keyword analysis can be done here <a href="https://appstorerankings.net/">appstorerankings.net.</a> If in the App Store the search is performed solely by name and keywords, then on Google Play, the keys must be written in the application description.  There simply is not a special field for this, but it uses a more advanced search engine - it can scan the entire page of the application, and not just a separate column. <br><br>  6. The <b>size of the</b> application must meet the requirements stor.  With the release of the seventh version of Apple has increased the limit on the size of applications that are loaded into the market.  Now programs, up to 100 MB in size, will be downloaded via 3G networks.  For Google Play, the size of applications should not exceed 50 MB.  If the size is greater than the specified values, the download will need to connect to Wi-Fi.  This may entail a dump of users who have found your application in the store, simply because of the lack of access to the point of wireless Internet. <br><br>  7. <b>Reviews</b> .  It is necessary to constantly monitor reviews, minus inadequate and unreasonable, they do not need you.  If you want to write reviews yourself, be careful - you shouldn‚Äôt be noticed, make the reviews diverse: give different ratings, leave comments ‚Äúon the case‚Äù, and not just praise your application. <br><br>  8. Placing the application in the <b>correct category is</b> also an important factor.  Analyze where your competitors are located, and which category will be most appropriate for you.  You can choose another way - analyze which of the categories of the smallest applications and then you will have a chance to get to its top, with almost no effort.  Do not forget that the display of applications in the store does not happen immediately, if we talk about the App Store, you will have to wait up to two weeks, so consider the time for your application to exit.  If you are releasing a seasonal product, if your discounts are coming, the time factor will play an important role.  Also note that according to statistics, the largest number of downloads takes place on weekends and holidays. <br><br><h4>  - Fly!  Buy one! </h4><br>  Even creating a really useful application, you can not be sure that your product will start to buy.  Mobile application just get lost among thousands of the same and lie on the bottom.  You can just copy and collect all your cream yourself.  To prevent this, it is necessary to make every effort to make the application visible to the target consumer. <br>  Consider the main ways of promotion that will help create an "information boom" around your product.  Promotional measures must be taken online, until the application is lost in the vast spaces. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/269/372/eee/269372eee5ffd0a0e6cc9adc12b80a7c.jpg"><br><br>  1. <b>Advertising in other applications</b> .  Although it is irritable, it nevertheless effectively affects consumers.  There are mobile networks where you can place advertising information.  With the right settings, the conversion to the installation can reach 20%. <br><br>  2. <b>Banner contextual advertising</b> .  Placing on thematic sites will give a good response from consumers.  The main thing, do not forget to follow the statistics in time to make adjustments. <br><br>  3. Classic - <b>mentioning applications in reviews</b> .  They are read by people from your target audience, so potential customers can quickly become real.  Follow user comments, they can be constructive and help you to improve your service.  In addition to attracting potential users, the reviews will attract attention to your brand, which will only benefit you in the future. <br><br>  4. Popularity is gained by <b>social networks</b> and become an effective advertising platform.  You can conduct as a whole group, or just create an account on Twitter.  Tell about yourself on thematic forums, create polls, leave your links, organize contests, distribute bonuses.  With likes and repost you connect this type of advertising, like word of mouth.  Put the like and share functions right inside the app.  Take advantage of them to increase the loyalty of your users, recommendations and feedback from friends will play in your favor. <br><br>  5. <b>Writing press releases</b> .  You can contact the services of PR agencies or write and distribute releases yourself.  Professionally designed material can be in thematic editions: both print and online. <br><br>  6. Roll out <b>updates</b> : new features, changes, bug fixes.  You will be able to constantly be in the "New" section, coming across the eyes of new users, as well as creating the next info channel. <br><br>  7. <b>Participate in events</b> directly related to your product.  There you can demonstrate the work of your application and distribute promotional material. <br><br>  8. Use <b>cross promo</b> .  If you already have a mobile application, use it as an advertising platform for the newly created one.  It's free, but effective, especially if the functions of the applications overlap. <br><br>  9. <b>Fichering</b> .  If you convince the App Store moderators and Google Play that your app is worthy of attention, be creative and negotiate successfully, you will have many opportunities to increase the popularity of your app. <br><br>  10. <b>Make a free version of the</b> application.  Even if you want to make it paid, first get a free version with limited functionality.  Nobody will initially buy a product unfamiliar to him, it is better to pay for the extension of functions later. <br><br>  11. Take a <b>video</b> .  Even psychologists say that video is a good tool for popularization.  With it, you can clearly show your application.  Do not forget to distribute the link to it in the above-mentioned places: social networks, blogs, forums, reviews, thematic publications. <br><br>  Use all methods of advancement in aggregate, as each of them separately will not give you a good result, especially if you are not known yet among a wide range of users.  Working with engagement, working with your audience is a key aspect of promotion.  Relationship marketing is now at its peak of popularity. <br><br><br><h4>  Yes help you statistics </h4><br>  We created an application, started its promotion, now you need to collect the fruits of your efforts.  But not everyone knows that the App Store and Google Play stores do not have special tools for full analysis.  Therefore it is necessary to foresee this fact at the development stage.  Suitable services such as Flurry, Google Analytics and App Annie.  You do not have to let everything take its course and wait for a miracle in the form of thousands of installations and millions of satisfied users.  By collecting statistics, it will be easier for you to take appropriate measures to improve the application, you will know your user by sight and recognize its needs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f42/526/012/f4252601290b530bca8541e40ee943ab.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Flurry</b> <br>  Flurry-analytics tracks interactions in mobile applications, it is free, it runs on iOS, Android, Windows Phone, HTML5, BlackBerry and JavaME platforms. <br>  The system provides data on the reach of the audience and its interaction with the application, conversions, income.  In reports, it is easy to track application errors and their frequency by promptly making changes.  An additional advantage of Flurry is the processing of large amounts of data ‚Äî over 1.4 billion sessions per day. <br><br>  <b>Google Mobile App Analytics</b> <br>  Free mobile application statistics service.  Reports are divided into 4 sections: conversion, users, interaction and interaction results. <br>  Each of the sections provides complete statistical information. <br>  Conversion: new and active users and tracking the sources from which they came (you must first mark the links with special tags). <br>  Users: versions of applications installed from users - you can find out how often and quickly they update the application, as well as get an overview of the devices on which your application is used. <br>  Interaction: the loyalty of your customers, the frequency of use of the application and the level of involvement.  In addition, at your disposal visualization of screen views, actions and paths on the application, as well as failures and errors. <br>  In the "Results" section you will see the goals of the application and the purchases within it. <br><br>  <b>App annie</b> <br>  It is also a free service, running on iOS, Mac Store and Google Play platforms.  Here you can view statistics on installations, sales, ratings, and in different countries, as well as track feedback on the application. <br><br><h4>  Be in the top </h4><br>  TOP is the first place where the user learns about new applications.  To get into it you need a large number of installations - in the USA there are approximately 72 thousand downloads for TOP-10 free applications, for paid TOP-10, the figure is much smaller, from 4 thousand installations.  As for the Russian site, about 16% of the number of downloads in the homeland of ayproduktsii.  The more you download, the faster you get into the TOP. <br>  Both markets have ratings for paid and free applications and by category.  Tops of categories are also divided as well as the overall rating.  The categories tops get easier, but the return may be lower. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fc/5c5/139/9fc5c51393fc6b7c71614a31b941169f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Seven times measure cut once </h4><br>  As you can see, it is necessary to pay attention to the details.  Carefully approach the development of the application, think over everything: from the size to the category.  And, most importantly, do not stop at the creation, but continue to lead your application to the masses, directly into the hands of the target user, using all possible and impossible ways of promotion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201628/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201628/</a></p>
