This pushed me to write this topic.  Here I will talk about the device itself, as well as about the quests that the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù owner of this device has to decide.  If it is interesting to you, welcome under cat.  (A lot of pictures) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Preamble </h2><br>  A few months ago, after a 2-week market research of electronic readers, I purchased PocketBook IQ701.  Looking ahead, I‚Äôll say: that the device itself, before updating the firmware, was just lying on my shelf, because it was impossible to use it, you will learn the details from the second part of the article, but for now, let's begin. <br><br><h2>  <b>Part one.</b>  <b>Overview</b> </h2><br><h3>  Why IQ701 </h3><br>  A reader who has an understanding of the market of electronic readers may ask: <br>  ‚ÄúSo what the hell is a Pocketbook IQ 701?‚Äù  After all, there is a huge number of cool readers! " <br>  I will answer in order: <br>  1. There is a backlight (My wife reads at night, and the light annoys me). <br>  2. The temptation of buns (Android with all the consequences). <br>  3. Touch screen (I‚Äôve been reading for a long time on various devices and just can‚Äôt imagine navigating the screen more than 2 "without a touch). <br>  4. Quite vigorous processor (I am sure that the processor at 400 MHz will not be able to scroll properly to pdf with a size of 15 MB, maybe in vain). <br>  5. Quite a decent manufacturer, there are no complaints about the product (or rather, it was not when I bought this ‚Äúunit‚Äù). <br>  6. Reasonable price. <br><br><h3>  Unpacking aka Unboxing </h3><br>  The packaging was prepared really decent, in the best traditions of famous manufacturers

Yes, they saved on the USB cable. <br><br>  Box inside: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11e/312/ae4/11e312ae477e439f1ef729cf909aebe8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The case is made of velvety, dense fabric and is quite comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/52c/6fc/f68/52c6fcf68924987c64f6e1fdd328681a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Appearance </h3><br>  The standard form factor for the tablet / book, I must recognize the quality of performance at 4+, strong, no squeaks until I removed the cover, I broke 2 plastic cards, the infection is very tight.  Good quality plastic.  But the screen on the contrary - is not protected and is easily scratched, so you have to deal with it appropriately.  A screen sticker is not an option.  A rezhestivny tach and so not a fountain, but with a sticker, I think it will generally be bent. <br><br>  Under the back cover you can see the internal memory slot and battery.  I tried to see what was under the battery, but I could not, apparently the factory workers did not spare the glue. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4cd/437/066/4cd4370667370402e2b3800950e132ba.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Color ... With color I was not lucky when I ordered, it was blue and red (just some kind of matrix), in general, the red in the picture is closer to the cherry, and the blue was somewhat dirty.  As a result, I ordered red, and it turned out to be dark pink. <br><br>  At the top end: the power button, reset, mini-USB, memory card slot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/815/086/a8e/815086a8ef715f6fdfcb12a694ecf911.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the right: a volume rocker and a hole for hooking the lid (as you can see, I was already snagging). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50c/13f/029/50c13f0292c5516275f27c0ef0e5ca47.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the left: Nefig. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8a9/648/812/8a96488120ecdaa4d3f16278c81e3964.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the bottom: a headphone jack, stereo speakers (and quite loud), a charging jack and a charging indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/248/7f7/328/2487f7328b63bbc0bbcb858ab6bbdff1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Unfortunately, it is impossible to charge this miracle from USB, since the charge voltage is 12 V. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95e/b73/266/95eb73266dfa3a2e709beb0689884dd7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The screen is average for 4, the viewing angles are quite apart from the top view - on it there is a color inversion.

It was terrible to read books.  he braked even when flipping through a simple txt file for 500kb.  Surfing the Internet turned out to be a dubious pleasure, because it simply did not display some sites (lack of flash and fonts), and some of them dropped the browser.  Calendar was absent altogether.  Market was not, for him SAM.  The video works, but one time (clearly encoded in mp4, 480p and less.).  It was possible to listen to music (cool, I have a player with a touch screen of 7 'and a pound weight).  Sometimes the device simply does not wake up, you have to juggle the battery.  Yes, a couple of days later it turned out that this ‚Äúplayer‚Äù sits exactly 10 hours after being removed from charge, whether you use it or not. (All of the above is true for firmware 2.0.2) Since the device was donated (and brought from another countries) I could not return it, therefore, I began to smoke manuals and solve step-by-step quests that Pocketbook firmly prepared for users. <br><br><h3>  Diagnosis </h3><br>  The main problems from the moment of purchase were: <br>  1. Spontaneous turning on the device (which led to a rapid discharge of the battery). <br>  2. A small amount of free memory for installing applications. <br>  3. Not always when turned on, an external card is mounted. <br>  4. Lack of market. <br>  5. Sometimes the sound disappears, it is solved by rebooting. <br>  6. Sometimes the launcher goes into reboot. <br>  7. Rarely it happens, it does not wake up and does not even react to the reset.  You have to juggle the battery. <br>  Here is proof: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/aizCTQftMBY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhbeEsBVoxVVq_qgIKwtqJ7T4H9fg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  8. Video plays by mood. <br><br><h3>  What has changed with the new firmware </h3><br>  The first two problems were resolved after the Pocketbook released firmware under the number 2.0.5. (Before it was 2.0.3. And .2.0.4, but did not bring any significant improvements).  Waking up the book stopped <s>God bless Pocketbook!</s>  , as well as in the new firmware part of the memory (1GB of 2 on the internal microSD) is reserved for the system, and is available for installing applications. <br>  And after the upgrade, the following improvements were noticed: <br>  The screen has become more responsive to touch.  Widget from Pocketbook has become prettier and faster. <br>  WI-FI clings normally, there used to be sometimes cliffs.  The browser has become more stable.  Unfortunately, the improvements end there. <br>  Some problems can be solved programmatically.  You can put the market, however, you will have to tinker with your Android ID.  For video, I use RockPlayer, after adding OpenGL it supports hardware acceleration. <br><br><h3>  Usability </h3><br>  Frankly, the device even after the firmware functions on the top three.  Perhaps, I want too much from an unhappy reading room, but you see, devices with similar hardware under an android are quite capable of working without brakes, not only in book mode.  Yes, I have to admit that if the book does not load with Internet and movies, then it can work without glitches <s>, and it may not work at all.</s>  <s>Here is how the chip will fall</s> . <br>  Charging time is about 3 hours after the update, the device works 10 hours in book mode and about 5 hours with an average load (wi-fi, youtube, internet, movies). <br>  WI-FI is normal, works at almost the same distance as the HTC HD2.  There is TTS (Text to speech, though accents are lame).  Also, there is support for dictionaries and works correctly. <br><br>  For clarity of the device, I made a few videos.  All tests were conducted on clean firmware 2.0.6.  From applications installed only Quick settings and Quadrant.  Before shooting, the device was overloaded to free up RAM. <br><br>  <b>Reading books of different sizes and formats (details in the video),</b> <b><br></b>  <b>and also a calendar, notes and a dictionary.</b> <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/OzCVmgBrRDQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhrelqyeYOSQQ1y-Baoch-yAN5u5w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>The Internet and Quadrant (almost a fable).</b>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-GJ2QvenwG8">More videos at the request of workers.</a>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-GJ2QvenwG8">Dropbox, gps-tracker.com.ua and asusmobile.ru</a> <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/7pp4He6ZFUc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg2k4HLqFsnMqEOt9ZjCmUm07AMUA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  I tried to put a microSDHC class 6 4Gb card.

On the one hand he has a pretty decent iron, but on the other hand he has very raw software.  However, it should be noted that the pocketbook company often still finishes its devices (at the time of writing, 2 firmware was changed, the last one at the moment 2.0.6).  But until that happens, I would not advise anyone to purchase this gadget. (Unless of course you are called Cyanogen and you don‚Äôt fix the core of the android in the morning, instead of breakfast.) <br><br>  Ps: All of the above, is solely my subjective opinion.  Therefore, I ask you to forgive if I have touched this topic, whose religious beliefs, or destroyed the fragile youthful brain.  Thank you for your attention and good luck to us all! <br><br>  UPD: Next to the video on the surf on the Internet added a link to the video with more heavy sites. <br>  Thank you <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/tarakan/" class="user_link">TARAKAN</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117124/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117124/</a></p>
