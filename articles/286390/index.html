And, as you know, if <s>you suffer a lot - something will</s> work you work with enthusiasm - the result will not take long.  And so, today we want to share with you our latest achievements and achievements. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But first, some abstract news.  First, we did the repair in the office.  Now we are drawing on the walls, which have turned from a soulless ceiling stand into a source of motivation and an instrument of creativity.  You can see photos on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/payler">our Facebook page</a> . <br><br>  Secondly, right after the New Year, Wikipedia recognized us as a significant company and did not delete <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payler">our page</a> , which also is good news.

      Thirdly, our blog is divided and now there will be twice as much news - our thoughts and practical advice on the development remained the same address on Habr√©, and on the Megamind we will share our experience in monetizing web services and other things that are interesting from the management and management in ecommerce.  So, if anyone reads us for the first time - welcome!  In our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/payler">Habrablog</a> you can read about how we created and developed our services. <br><br>  Well, now to the main events in recent months. <br><br>  We launched the <b>mobile application for Yulmart</b> - its design and development was fully implemented by our team <a href="http://poloniumarts.com/">Polonium Arts</a> .  Until recently, the application was available for iOS and Android smartphones, but now we have also released an adaptive iPad version.  In addition to the basic functionality - searching, comparing and ordering goods - the addresses of all stores are available in the appendix, as well as a form of quick contact with the customer support service ‚ÄúWhat is with my order?‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/566/e4b/929/566e4b9298474bd693aba8fdb859153e.jpg"><br><br>  <b>The flower delivery service in the metro</b> , which we developed together with Maxima Telecom and Rostsvettorg, will work in mid-March and will be available at flowers.vmet.ro: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46e/23b/512/46e23b5128e348c9a3dc6fa77c62c5bc.png"><br><br>  Next month, our project for the <b>Arkady Novikov Group of Companies</b> , a mobile application with Payler integrated payment gateway, will see the light.  Our design team Polonium Arts is also responsible for the design and development of this project.  The application will allow you to find the right places for the given parameters, as well as using multiple filters - for example, by city, your own custom preferences or the kitchen.  The functionality of the application will also allow to book tables in two clicks and make payment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dab/3a6/780/dab3a678093849c6b5171b5bcc217479.jpg"><br><br>  Our <b>P2P translation service</b> is at the final stage of development and will be available to everyone by the end of April. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c3/8ab/534/9c38ab534f2640bf97c0fb11b6bba7df.jpg"><br><br>  And we are launching <b>European acquiring from Payler</b> and from April we can already work with foreign companies - at the moment we are at the stage of signing an agreement with a European bank. <br><br>  Also now we are working with Alfa Bank, and <b>connecting</b> to Payler <b>takes only a couple of days</b> from the moment of agreement.  The package of necessary documents has also been reduced - now a single contract is needed for connection. <br><br>  In addition, we are drawing a <b>new Payler site</b> .  Big changes are coming up in your personal account - you will be able to manage several companies / stores in one account.  And there will appear a chat with round-the-clock technical support, several new modules and setting up widgets for payment analytics.  We will tell about this in a separate post. <br><br>  We also <b>expanded our field of</b> <b>activity</b> - now we have merchant acquiring services, self-service terminals - where you can pay, including invoices issued from Payler - and auto-collection.  This direction is developed by our partners and friends, <a href="http://itb-t.ru/">ITB Technologies</a> . <br><br>  And below the picture below you can read about our new <b>mobile commerce and mobile marketing service</b> - it is called Billingrad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f63/f9c/2e6/f63f9c2e62ce4c6f8f02b64637648242.jpg"><br><br><h2>  What is Billingrad? </h2><br>  Let's remember how the evolution of mobile technology took place.  At first there were operators' offices - we went there through half the city, stood in lines, and all just to pay for mobile communication.  Then scratch cards appeared.  Then - self-service terminals.  We learned how to pay bills online.  And now Billingrad has come. <br><br>  In many ways, smartphones have already replaced computers, laptops, navigators, wallets.  Mobile Internet replaces landline.  Billingrad is technology for the mobile era business. <br><br><h2>  Functional </h2><br>  We divide all the functionality of Billingrad into two areas - mobile commerce and mobile marketing.  The first is aimed at streamlining payment acceptance channels, and the second is at using mobile technologies to promote the brand and communicate with customers. <br><br>  Tell you more. <br><br><h2>  Mobile commerce </h2><br>  No one wants to carry a wallet full of cards and coins, no one wants to spend time paying bills at the bank.  Mobile commerce allows you to pay for goods and services in two clicks, directly from the balance of the phone.  Billingrad has two options for accepting payments: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Payment of any amount up to 15 thousand from the personal account of the phone; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Premium SMS - fixed payments up to 300 rubles for short numbers; <br><br><h2>  Mobile marketing </h2><br>  When was the last time you spent the day without your smartphone?  We, too, never.  A smartphone is a continuation of a hand in space, a way to survive and be in time, without it anywhere.  The smartphone is always in hand - it is uncultivated virgin for business.  At Billingrad, we learned how to use it and offer the following services: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ SMS informing - mass mailing of branded SMS messages. <br>  ‚Ä¢ IVR - an interactive voice service that allows you to ring up customer bases, pronounce greetings and distribute calls without the operator‚Äôs participation.  And the interactivity of the service allows you to conduct polls and go to the voice menu.  Message templates, a mailing schedule, and a mailing list are customizable options, which saves you from having to remember when, to whom, and what message you need to send. <br>  ‚Ä¢ USSD is an interactive text service capable of organizing a dialogue with a client in a question-answer format with several levels.  At the time of the USSD request, the GSM cellular network with an accuracy of up to 10 meters determines the location of the subscriber and, depending on the service logic, provides him with certain information.  For example, addresses of the nearest gas stations or ATMs. <br><br>  And besides, USSD allows you to implement text mailings.  Their effectiveness is extremely high - the recipient is guaranteed to see the message. <br><br>  We cooperate with the ‚Äúbig four‚Äù of Russian cellular operators - MTS, Beeline, Megafon and Tele-2, which opens <s>all doors of</s> wide opportunities for interaction with subscribers of these operators. <br><br>  In general, while developing Billingrad, we were guided by the same ideals as in creating Payler - a technological, multifunctional assistant, understandable and accessible, able to independently cope with tasks for which a whole staff of people was needed before.  We position Payler and Billingrad as friendly services that work perfectly separately, but together that can optimize the client‚Äôs work to the maximum. <br><br>  Billingrad corresponds to 152 of the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Personal Data‚Äù, which means that companies and organizations can, with a clear conscience, transfer to Billingrad the personal data of their clients and not waste time getting the certificate themselves. <br><br>  A little later, we will devote a separate security post - tell you how we passed the PCI DSS certification upgrade to version 3.0 and about ten kilograms of documents to get compliance with 152 FZ. <br><br>  For now - <a href="http://my.billingrad.com/">here</a> you can register and feel Billingrad in action. <br><br>  Stay in touch, it will be interesting! <br><br>  <i>Thanks to all,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>your payler &amp; billingrad</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286390/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286390/</a></p>
