Recruiters and recruitment agencies will work more actively with customers who have a need for employees, but there is no way to look for them on their own. <br><br>  Up to five recruiters can work simultaneously on one employer application.  The one whose candidate first goes to work or passes a probationary period (at the option of the customer) receives a fee appointed by the employer.  Commission service will be 20%, according to representatives of HeadHunter.

      They argue that the model of this service is built by analogy with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">the Uber model</a> .  Looking ahead, we recall that this is not the first such service in the Russian market. <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  First, the employer publishes an application for selection, setting the price that he is willing to pay the executor for the work.  HRspace reserves this money to provide the performer a guarantee of payment.  Then executive recruiters see employers' applications and respond to them if they are ready to take on the job. </blockquote>  Document management and payment between customers and performers will take over the service: users will not need to enter into additional contracts, it is enough to accept the public offer of the service. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe burden of our obligations is the hardest: recruiters can really make money and so far pay nothing for working with us.  Employers save because they can set the price themselves.  We will sift out only ‚Äúinadequate‚Äù vacancies, for example, the financial director for 10 thousand rubles, ‚Äùthe head of HRspace Roman Efimov <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2957806">told</a> Kommersant. <br><br>  The competitors of the service on the Russian market are <a href="http://junglejobs.ru/">JungleJobs</a> , <a href="http://pruffi.ru/">Pruffi</a> , <a href="http://hrtime.ru/">HRTime</a> , <a href="https://stafory.com/">Stafory</a> and others. <br><br>  Stafory is Russia's first service for employers and recruitment agencies, its representatives say.  Among the minuses of the usual recruitment agencies, they <a href="https://stafory.com/about.html">indicate</a> : <br><br><ul><li>  Endless cold calls </li><li>  Lack of ‚Äúhonest‚Äù rating of recruitment agencies </li><li>  The inconvenience of working with multiple recruiters at the same time </li><li>  A large number of commercial offers and specifications sent by e-mail </li></ul><br>  The search engine model with the help of independent recruiters and recommendations of users of social networks uses the agency Pruffi Alena Vladimirskaya.  Service commission is charged in the range of one to several monthly salaries of a successful candidate to someone who offers the right candidate. <br><br>  Vladimirskaya <a href="https://roem.ru/08-04-2016/222090/hh-ru-uberstyle/">admits</a> that HRspace can ‚Äúkill‚Äù traditional small agencies, but only if it can provide recruiters with protection from unscrupulous customers.  And in the case of personnel search, in her opinion, this will be much more difficult than in the Uber ecosystem. <br><br>  JungleJobs has been on the market for over a year.  In August 2015, the <a href="http://impulsevc.com/">Impulse VC</a> Foundations (in which the structures of Roman Abramovich are participating) and The Untitled <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/25/08/2015/55dc540d9a7947807e52abde">invested</a> $ 500,000 in the service. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe believe that JungleJobs will be one of the companies that will change the archaic and non-transparent recruitment market, and will make it convenient for both clients and recruiters,‚Äù said Impulse VC partner Kirill Belov. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe HR-marketplace model, where the employer and recruiter meet, and the whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãkilling up the recruitment services has already been the impetus for the new development of this industry in Russia, where stagnation and stagnation have been observed for the last 25 years,‚Äù says JungleJobs founder Yevgenia Dvorskaya.  In her opinion, HRspace is well suited for mass selection, where there is no need for in-depth testing of candidates' knowledge. <br><br>  An example of a service for non-mass recruitment is the foreign platform <a href="http://www.toptal.com/about">Toptal</a> .  Under its flag, it unites 3% of specialists who meet the highest requirements of professionalism. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere are many professionals in the market whose high level is obvious.  People should be able to find out that there are cool specialists and they can be hired.  And the way to find out about this should be absolutely scalable, and most importantly, all participants should trust it, ‚Äùsaid Toptal CEO Taso Du Val in <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24062/">an interview with</a> Megamind.  Toptal is an online community of software developers and designers. <br><br>  On February 26, Megamind <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/24374">wrote</a> that <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail.Ru_Group">Mail.ru Group Limited</a> announced the sale of the HeadHunter service. <br><br>  The amount of the transaction for the sale of HeadHunter to a consortium of investors led by <a href="http://www.elbcp.ru/">Elbrus Capital,</a> which previously acted as one of the buyers, amounted to 10 billion rubles.  The company, whose assets are limited to the recruitment site, was estimated at six times its annual profit. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300008/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300008/</a></p>
