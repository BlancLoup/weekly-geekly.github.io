  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Derivatives</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bb7ad644/f2b21e85/7026f9e7/81e30563.gif" align="left"><br>  Once at school, I did not understand derivatives.  Do not think that I was quite a fool - I knew the definition, knew how to take them (as part of simple school examples) and had good grades in mathematics.  But here the meaning of this concept eluded me.  I understood how important the graph of a certain function is - it is easy to see the function‚Äôs dependence on the argument.  I looked at some point and the situation in this particular place was immediately clear.  And what about me with the derivative?  Well, I know "the <i>limit of the ratio of the increment of a function to the increment of its argument when the increment of the argument tends to zero, if such a limit exists</i> " - and what?  In general, I did not understand this thing.  And did not like. <br>  And only much later, already at the university, when it turned out that not a single important task in physics, electrical engineering, automatic control systems, mathematical analysis and many other objects without derivatives is not solved - I realized what an important thing is - knowledge not only the current state of affairs, but also the dynamics of their change.  It would seem, and what an article with such a beginning can do in this blog? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And that's what.  Imagine two people.  Let them be called Kohl and Peter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d3fab8a4/42f9f118/42589420/9b571b5e.png"><br><br>  Kohl and Peter - the same age, sex, with the same education and work in the same company, at the same level and get the same salary.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/678a6391/a28d837d/3739a83a/43ceffdd.png"><br><br>  What conclusions can be drawn from this input?  Can we say that their life is the same?  Can we say that they are equally satisfied financially and personally?  Can you say that their careers are built in a similar way? <br>  Of course, nifiga like! <br>  The fact is that Kohl - he was always very smart, hardworking before, before the moment we observed, his career went very well.  He was chief of chief Petit and earned 25 times more.  But then something changed in his life - maybe his wife left, maybe she‚Äôs in a sect, and maybe she started drinking.  Or all together.  The glitter in his eyes disappeared, after two ripped projects in his post, he was lowered and the gloating silhouette of dismissal loomed on the horizon. <br>  But Petya has never been a genius.  He was an ordinary clever laborer who worked honestly.  Without heroic accomplishments and shameful failures.  His career was slowly and smoothly moving up the hill and the chair of the department head was already, in principle, ready to take in his ass. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/221b6d83/edd96249/4afa99b5/bcdd8d6b.png"><br><br>  This is the importance of understanding the dynamics of the process.  We look to fix the material on another situation. <br>  We have Masha, Dasha and Natasha. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7c20d207/fa1b4dfd/4a636a9c/676fe546.png"><br>  They, like their friends Kolya and Petya, are completely identical in their current state (age, work, salary, marital status, etc.).  Moreover, we even know something about their past.  None of them ever climbed above the current place in life, they did not have any force majeure, and we have one more important thing - information about some point in the past (say, a year ago).  And according to this information - again, all the objective parameters of these girls were equal.  Let's return to our questions.  How about assessing the status of these ladies?  Can we talk about one level of career growth, ambitions, achievements and where each of them will be in 5 years? <br>  And, of course, again - like! <br><br>  Look at this chart: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7a34a146/758fd427/98daa058/8cae178b.png"><br><br>  Dasha is a stable middling.  It grows to the best of its strength, these forces will suffice for everything and will suffice. <br>  Natasha - still cope, but without the former enthusiasm.  More than now, she does not want and does not shine.  This is almost its limit. <br>  Masha is a strong and ambitious person.  The current point - just an annoying misunderstanding, the first step in the stairs of her career.  Well, it was just that there was still little time and we could not climb higher yet.  But it will definitely succeed and all forces will be thrown at it. <br><br><h4>  What is it for me? </h4><br>  <b>1.</b> Often in conversations between people who have not met for a long time, or who have just met, people skip phrases in the spirit of: <br><ul><li>  Where do you work? </li><li>  And by whom? </li><li>  How much do you get? </li></ul>  etc. <br>  People get answers to these questions and judge them about the interlocutor.  But this is just a ‚Äústate of affairs at a given point,‚Äù which, as we have already learned, carries little information.  Do not judge hastily. <br><br>  <b>2.</b> Sometimes a person looks at himself from the outside and comes to the conclusion that, they say, ‚ÄúI am a nothing, poor and needy, and still a fool and a meddler‚Äù or, on the contrary, ‚ÄúI have achieved everything, I am cool, white and fluffy‚Äù.  In the first case, people in vain put a cross on themselves and climb into a loop, although you can still get out, in the second, they relax and rest on their laurels too early, although because of some angle, a crisis, a kapets and the end of the world can easily sneak up. <br><br>  <b>3.</b> Look at the charts above.  Where is yours?  Are you sure?  And why?  Are you moving on it?  And in your position and in your company in general, you can move on it?  What stops you?  Do you want to be at the same point in 5 years?  And on the same chart? <br><br>  <b>What is the sign of your derivative?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285408/</a></p>
