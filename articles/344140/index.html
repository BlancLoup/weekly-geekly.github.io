Not a fake.  But about the money.  Alas. <br><br>  For the first time I was surprised, for the second I was amazed, for the third I called technical support (yes, yes, the one where you have to tell the robot with your voice what you are calling about; he didn‚Äôt master the words ‚Äúspam‚Äù or even ‚Äúaccount‚Äù , but oh well, I did not expect).  I talked, I became nervous, I said goodbye - the messages both came and continued (and now they are flying, which prompted me to write this post). <br><br>  Text in plain text.  I will not torture with the view of the photo on my phone, I will bring content on a yellow ‚Äúquote‚Äù Habrav background: <br><blockquote>  On the LS 111111111111 billed number 4 for November 2017 in the amount of 200.00 p.  Payable, taking into account the debt 300,00 rub. </blockquote>  <i>(I scored the drug number here in units, because I received messages about different drugs; the amounts were also different, so I guess they told me about the debts of different subscribers)</i>

      I have no contract with RT for anything at all, I‚Äôve had a mobile number for a long time, in general, ‚Äúnothing foreshadows trouble,‚Äù but SMS-rain continues.  A couple of times they were called by menacing voices (I suppose) the employees of the Republic of Tajikistan, and asked when I would bring them money, otherwise they gathered in court.  They found out in each case that my number was, but I did not have a contract, thought, said goodbye ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  And the truth of life was simple and clear.  It turns out that when entering into an agreement with Rostelecom, the subscriber indicates his phone number in the application form (which is logical) - and <b>no one checks</b> this phone!  Any mistake in writing the number, or in entering it by the employee of the RT in the user's card, or the subscriber's dishonesty when specifying the number (well, someone does not like spam, it happens!) - and the ‚Äúleft‚Äù number will go to the user's personal business.  But to change this number, even in case of an erroneous indication of it, the real owner of the number cannot - this can be done <b>only upon presentation of the passport of</b> the contract holder with Rostelecom! <br><br>  What particularly pleases: <b>apparently, RT has no procedure for solving these problems</b> .  Employees on the support line cannot do anything - moreover, when I call in support of the RT, I‚Äôm nobody (not even a subscriber) for them, so they don‚Äôt really take a ticket from me and can‚Äôt (or don‚Äôt want). <br><br>  <b>Attention, the question: how to unsubscribe from "spam with other people's accounts"?</b>  I don‚Äôt even speak about RT changing its free subscription procedure for financial spam. <br><br>  PS I think, by the way, the RT is not alone here, in many companies when you specify a phone, no verification (at least by calling or sending SMS) is done, so the spam attack vector is still.  And after all, which is characteristic from the point of view of the RT, it is not even spam! <br><br>  PPS Dear <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/rostelecom/" class="user_link">Rostelecom</a> , I see you answered (not during working hours, but still) below in comments.  Not to me, but answered (I don‚Äôt know why not the author of the post, then).  Can I contact you here and decide the topic with you?  I promise to post the correspondence here, and together we will show how such problems are solved in an exemplary manner. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344140/</a></p>
