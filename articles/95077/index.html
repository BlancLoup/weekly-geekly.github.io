  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to win the heart of Yandex?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  You can often hear complaints that large players on the Internet market are not interested in start-ups, that it‚Äôs almost impossible to get through and tell your idea, that there are not enough tools to even quickly create a prototype of a product that can be convincingly presented and understood. , is it interesting to them. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://img571.imageshack.us/img571/3623/forrelease.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  Startup Point decided to help developers by opening new ideas to the direct route to the doors of Yandex.  At the 19th Startup Point meeting in Moscow, Yandex representatives Grigory Bakunov and Anton Zabannyh told how you can use Yandex tools to create your own projects. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How to do it and what is needed for this? <br><br><h4>  1. Come up with an idea </h4><br>  The idea should be fresh and original.  Approximate areas of activity that may be of interest to Yandex may include, for example: <br>  - analysis, structuring of personal (mail, subscriptions, etc.) and general information flow (news, blogs, etc.), for example, using data extraction technology; <br>  - new interface solutions for web services and applications; <br>  - processing and presentation of personal data in various fields (finance, medicine, documents, etc.); <br>  - methods of studying user behavior on the Internet, advertising technologies. <br>  A more detailed and official list of areas of their interests will be published by Yandex in the near future.  To be limited to this list is not necessary, the main thing is for the idea to be really interesting. <br><br><h4>  2. Use the tools of Yandex </h4><br>  In order for you to quickly build a prototype of your product, Yandex offers to use your tools: API for a number of your projects. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The API of some Yandex products (such as Blogs, Photos or Maps) are already open and documented, you can see their full list at <a href="http://api.yandex.ru/">api.yandex.ru</a> <br><br>  In addition, in the framework of cooperation with Startup Point, Yandex is ready to provide access to the internal API of other projects: at the moment it is the Yandex.Mail and RSS subscriptions API. <br><br>  Regular APIs simply extend the functionality of the product for which they are intended ‚Äî for example, using such APIs, you can write your own plug-ins for Mail, which will show additional information about the sender of the letter, thumbnails of documents in non-original formats, etc. <br><br>  Top-secret internal APIs of Yandex are the tools on which the product is completely built: for example, Yandex Mobile Mail is entirely made on the Mail API.  These are powerful tools for the development of full-fledged new products in which all the functionality of the original product can be involved. <br><br><h4>  3. Ask for advice from Yandex </h4><br>  In early July, we plan to hold a special Startup Weekend - an event where a program participant has a chance to build a prototype of his product in 54 hours, if necessary, using the advice of Yandex technology experts. <br><br>  In addition, program participants can ask questions about the functionality provided by the API and, in some cases, request and receive the opportunity to enhance the API capabilities necessary for product development. <br><br><h4>  4. Show your product to Yandex </h4><br>  At the end of the summer, we will hold a final event - a presentation of prototypes and finished projects to Yandex.  At this meeting will be attended by the leadership of Yandex, including the leaders of the main directions of the company.  Only the most interesting projects will be presented: prepared during the program, or found by us in the community. <br><br>  With the participants of the projects that Yandex liked the most, Yandex will talk to itself :) <br><br>  How to participate in the program: <br><br>  Write us a letter to the address yandex@startuppoint.ru, in which state: <br>  - the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe product is not very long, please. <br>  - the degree of readiness of the product ¬¨‚Äì the idea, the prototype, the finished project. <br>  - do you need access to internal APIs of products (Mail and RSS-subscriptions) - we will contact Yandex with a request to open access for you. <br>  - Do you need people to implement a prototype of the product - we will try to help you by placing an ad about finding the right people on the website <a href="http://www.startuppoint.ru/">www.StartupPoint.ru</a> and on other friendly sites. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95077/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95077/</a></p>
