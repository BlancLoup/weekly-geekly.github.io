  <section class="page js-page"><h1>An article on the order: to offer a topic of the article and who gave karma or an invite</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I once read how people complained about negative karma and difficulty in getting an invite.  It‚Äôs hard to come up with a topic and write a good post on it, and some are simply not enough karma for that.  I have the opposite, the problem is rather to find time to write a post, there is always a topic.  But there are some things that I would like to see, but, again, there is no time to find it myself. <br><br>  How about creating a list of topics that a person with karma / invite is interested in and for which he is ready to share something good?  Then people will not choose a topic at random, but know for sure that if they do this, then there will definitely be a person to whom this is interesting and there will be karma / invite. <br><br>  If there is not enough karma for the post, then you can show the person who asked for the post before publication and he will already give enough karma.

      It seems, from the point of view of the rules, there is nothing criminal.  A person honestly earns karma / invite for a good post, only it becomes a little easier for him, so for sure someone will be interested in the post.  And at the same time, the customer receives information on an interesting topic. <br><br>  Update with the description of the implementation under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  UPDATE: A bit about implementation. <br></h4><br>  I present the implementation of something like this: <br><br>  Task performance: <br>  1) The list is open and visible to all. <br>  2) A person who wants to try chooses a topic and blocks it. <br>  2.1) If after 2 days nothing happened, the topic is unlocked, and the one who took it for the first time receives punishment (minus karma for registered users or something (here I need help with ideas for potential users)).  And it all starts from the beginning. <br>  3) If within 2 days, the person makes the corresponding topic, he shows it to the customer. <br>  3.1) If the customer likes the work, then the topic is published, the customer pays for it with a karma / invite, everyone is happy and read the topic. <br>  3.2) If the work is not liked for objective reasons (it is necessary to make a list of possible objective reasons), then the person is given another day to correct errors, after which the customer checks again. <br>  3.3) If the customer is not available for an initial check within 2 days (or repeated within 1 day), the topic is simply published. <br>  3.4) If the post was published without verification and was unsuccessful (rating less than +20), the customer receives a minus in karma. <br>  3.5) If the post is not published within 5 days (the performer tried, but failed), everything starts again.  The customer receives a plus for the check, the performer minus for arrogance. <br><br>  Adding a job: <br>  1) The customer adds the task to be completed. <br>  2) The customer offers a price (no more karma / invite than he can give). <br>  3) The customer describes the minimum level of work (i.e. approximately what he expects to see there). <br><br>  Example: <br>  I want to know the performance of each mathematical operation (you can limit the most popular + - * /% &amp; | and all sorts of roots, trigonometry, lengths of vectors, but the more the better), which is supported by OpenCL on nVidia video card with Computing Capability 2.0.  Those.  The author should make a small test example, figure out how to measure time correctly and test all operations.  The author must also prove that everything depends on the performance of the kernel, and not on the memory / registers / PCIe / etc.  I would like a comparison of native functions with the same functions written by hand, for example, the calculation of the length of a vector.  I would also like to know the performance of integer operations. <br><br>  Something like this I imagine. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125818/</a></p>
