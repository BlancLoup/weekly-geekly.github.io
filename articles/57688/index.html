  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Perfect smartphone. Thoughts in the course of life</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I study everything on myself the features of mobile technology and came to certain conclusions. <br>  What would I personally like from a smartphone, what attracts me to this or that novelty in this market?  What I am looking for and do not find it yet. <br>  Under the cut - a lot of letters, a couple of questions and not a single ready-made solution, just dreams.  If you have something to say about this - welcome.  Dream together))) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have already found out for myself that many modern smartphones / communicators do not suit me.  Some models just tested for work for several days, with some went for some time, and then sold.  But he never became a fan of any single platform. <br><br><h4>  1. I do not like the design. </h4><br>  For some reason, manufacturers believe that if they included a bunch of functions in the device, then their device should look solid, like a brick, or at least a bar.  Not all, but many communicators suffer from this.  From the devices I have seen in recent years, I liked several models: <br>  <b>HTC S620 aka Excalibur</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/367/4ba/ee8/3674baee8b8b8ecb17a628d816cd85f8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>I-mate smartflip aka HTC StarTack etc.</b> <br><img src="http://www.city-mobile.co.uk/buy/images/phones/mobile/i-mate-smartflip.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Iphone 2g</b> <br><img src="http://palmwebos.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/iphone-2g.png" alt="image"><br>  This, in fact, the list ends ... <br><br><h4>  2. I do not like the OS. </h4><br>  It's harder here.  Not that I didn‚Äôt like all the OSes right, but none of the ones I‚Äôve seen completely suits me. <br>  Winda, especially the SE version (Smartphone Edition), is terribly inconvenient, there is no single place where you can find all existing applications for the system.  Requires ActiveSync to connect to a computer.  Yes, I know that there is a website hpc.ru, where you can find a lot of software.  But it‚Äôs difficult to call a centralized place.  Yes, I know that there are pribludy connecting device, like a flash drive.  But not for all software versions, and in this version the built-in modem does not work.  I generally keep quiet about working with the device under Lin. <br>  At first glance, the iPhone OS does not suffer from all these shortcomings, but ... If you have a centralized place to download programs, you need special software to download, plus the inability to work with files without iTunes (specifically, with music, this is a phone player, right ?!) plus the "pleasant" habit of the IPhone to climb on the Internet for various reasons, without asking permission ... <br>  It would seem that Symbian is the way out!  Not an exit.  Read point 1 - for the last 4 years I have not liked any smartphone.  Even the 5800 was a compromise, with a number of complaints (the case is plastic, a side around the screen etc). <br>  And point 2 - there is no centralized "repository" with the programs, many have to search through the authors' sites and find out their performance on a specific device "the hard way."

    <h4>  3. I do not like the "bust with functionality." </h4><br>  Yes, many functions are not always a blessing.  I absolutely do not need a GPS - I do not have a car, and somehow I am not inclined to get lost in the city.  There has not yet been a case where I could not get along with a regular map and the help of passersby. <br>  I do not need a <s>shit</s> player at all, just like a camera <s>shit</s> - stupid pribluda in the phone, if made "so it was."  After all, what happens is that manufacturers ‚Äútake‚Äù not with quality, but quantity, asking for a lot of money for the last bells and whistles, and then, having sold a lot of devices, they begin to refine the software so as not to get buggy.  Make you smaller, but better and more convenient for the same money - I will give without hesitation. <br><br>  Intentionally did not mention G1 and Palm Pre with their Android and WebOS, respectively, since I didn‚Äôt have the opportunity to test them, because we don‚Äôt officially have them yet. <br><br>  The conclusions, it would seem, are obvious - use the phone, player, laptop and camera separately. <br>  <b>But I also want to dream !!!</b> <br><br>  And that's what I planned for myself: <br>  It would be nice to sell 1-2-3 smartphones / communicators of different design and functionality, but ... <br>  ... with a basic set of functions in the "zero profile". <br>  Ie, for example, the manufacturer releases the device with the OS and a number of applications that allow you to make calls, send SMS / mail and work on the Internet / use as a modem.  Everything, there is a device, say 150-200 dollars.  This is for the design, production and development of competent OS. <br>  Next, the manufacturer creates a repository and puts in it "snacks" - programs that extend the functionality of the device.  For example, an application with player functions, one more - a PCC reader, another one - readers and so on.  Plus - third-party applications. <br>  And each user already chooses how to ‚Äúsharpen‚Äù a device for themselves - whether to buy ‚Äúadditional functions‚Äù or use the fact that there are ‚Äútricks‚Äù for a lower cost, i.e.  <b>not overpaying for unnecessary functionality</b> . <br>  Those.  This is an ideal IPhone option, but without a significant overpayment for marketing, public relations, etc., and without silly restrictions like ‚Äúmusic only from the iTunes store or only through a special synchronizer‚Äù. <br>  Vasya wants to make phone calls, play toys and listen to music - please, bought Bolvankofon for 5,000 rubles + bought a prog player and a couple of games.  And Vanya is sitting in ICQ, on Twitter, driving a car and running in the morning - please: ‚ÄúBolvankofon‚Äù + IM + cards + stopwatch / calorie counter. <br>  If I don‚Äôt know something and there is a similar miracle device, hint, eh ?!  ))) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57688/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57688/</a></p>
