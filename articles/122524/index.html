After the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/pay_sistem/118444/">story with the discharge of data</a> about the supporters of Navalny, I decided to replace the advertisement with Google AdSense. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For some reason it seemed to me that relations with a large global company would be more reliable and honest.  In the beginning, everything was like in a fairy tale: there were a lot of clicks, they were all quite expensive (that is, they brought more than Direct).  A few days ago (just before the first payment was due) a letter arrived: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello! <br><br>  After reviewing the data, we found that your account is a threat to create unacceptable activity.  Since we are responsible for protecting our AdWords advertisers from overstatement due to unacceptable activity, we found it necessary to close your AdSense account.  Your outstanding balance and Google‚Äôs revenue share will be fully refunded to affected advertisers.

      We ask you to treat this with understanding, as we have to take such measures to maintain the effectiveness of the Google advertising system, and especially the relationship between advertisers and publishers.  We realize that in this way we may have caused you inconvenience, and we hope for your understanding. <br><br>  Answers to questions and comments about the actions we have taken, as well as information on how to appeal this decision, and information about unacceptable activity in general, can be found at <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py%3Fanswer%3D57153">www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer= 57153</a> . <br><br>  Respectfully, <br><br>  google adsense team </blockquote><br><br>  It didn‚Äôt bother me at all, although it was a bit unpleasant that I‚Äôdn‚Äôt be able to enter the AdSense page (there was an inscription about blocking the account proudly).  They monitor the quality of clicks - great, only this should be the contextual advertising.  They blocked the account without warning, sent a template letter - not scary, I will tolerate, and advertisers will be sure that they are not throwing money away.  All my sites are of high quality and, after rechecking, the account is obviously unbanned. <br><br>  I took the opportunity that Google offered me and appealed the decision.  And he decided at this time to read about it in more detail.  The first search results led to the Google <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/adsense/">help forum</a> , and the first unpleasant discoveries were waiting for me there: <br><br><ul><li>  Forum <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/adsense/label%3Flid%3D68b5522ed0a9b30e%26hl%3Dru">overwhelmed with</a> questions about account blocking </li><li>  There are almost no Google employees on the forum. </li><li>  Those employees who occasionally appear never say something specific, but copy-paste the template response with a link to the certificate (by the way, most users already come to the forum from the help pages) </li></ul><br><br>  In general, if you are interested, you can see for yourself the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/adsense/thread%3Ftid%3D19995bd145a24e0c%26hl%3Dru">feedback of the</a> company with your partners. <br><br>  If you ever (God forbid) have a need to visit this thread of the forum, I cite its brief content so that you don‚Äôt waste your time in vain: <br><br>  <i>do {</i> <br>  <b>Question:</b> My account was blocked, I did not break the rules. <br>  <b>Answer:</b> Write the appeal, read the certificate. <br>  <b>Question:</b> There is nothing concrete in the certificate, the appeal was rejected. <br>  <b>Answer: It‚Äôs your</b> own fault, you shouldn‚Äôt have to break the rules! <br>  <b>Question:</b> I did not break the rules!  For what I was blocked, explain. <br>  <b>Answer:</b> In order to protect our detection system, we do not provide publishers with information about the activity in their accounts, including information about the web pages involved, users and third-party services. <br>  <b>Question:</b> What should I do? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> - <br>  <b>Question:</b> Will I get paid what I have already earned? <br>  <b>The answer is</b> no.  The income from your account will be returned to advertisers who have suffered damage. <br>  <b>Question:</b> Ie  All that I earned in a month - 100% not valid clicks?  Why not warned about invalid clicks before?  Which advertisers will give you money back?  What will happen to the money of advertisers who have long closed their companies? <br>  <b>Answer:</b> - <br>  <i>} while (1)</i> <br><br>  A few days later the worst fears were confirmed, the answer to the appeal came: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello! <br><br>  Thank you for filing an appeal.  We appreciate the additional information you provide, as well as your continued interest in the AdSense program.  However, by carefully re-examining all the data on your account and reviewing the information provided by you, our specialists confirmed that we cannot restore your AdSense account. <br><br>  We remind you that answers to questions and comments about your account, the actions we have taken, as well as information about unacceptable activity can be found at <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py%3Fanswer%3D57153">www.google.com/adsense/support/bin/answer.py?answer=57153</a> . <br><br>  If you have additional questions, we recommend visiting the AdSense Support Center: <a href="http://www.google.com/adsense_help">www.google.com/adsense_help</a> <br><br>  Respectfully, <br><br>  The Google AdSense Team </blockquote><br><br>  And that's all.  You broke the rules, which we will not say.  Account is blocked, you will not receive money.  Do whatever you want. <br><br>  Someone may, of course, argue: you supposedly took the rules of participation in the program, so why be surprised now? <br><br>  Firstly, if you do not talk about the rules, but talk about the relationship with partners, this attitude of the company towards a person is, at a minimum, rudeness.  It can be compared with the same Direct, where real people always answer and do not block without warning. <br><br>  Secondly, if we talk about the rules of participation, then neither Google, nor any other company has the right to create rules that contradict Russian legislation.  In this case, as far as I understand it, the company simply stole the money: no matter how many real clicks there were, how many not real ones, they simply appropriated money for everything before one click. <br><br>  Let's take an example.  Imagine that before the salary the employer declares: a part of your work is not of high quality, which one I don‚Äôt say specifically.  Because  poor work was, you do not get a penny.  Until! <br><br>  Fine? <br><br>  I think that it would not be superfluous to bring a couple of messages from the support forum (unanswered, of course) that were supported by the majority of users: <br><br><blockquote>  The question remains about the money earned.  The line that the money will be returned to advertisers is good.  But I know, probably, under a hundred people who actively use advords, and not one of them has ever returned money.  The answer to a query about whether it was, as a rule, is a smiley twisting finger at the temple.  Given the number of blocked users, it looks weird.  When blocking, it may still send money for clicks already paid by advertisers, in order not to give rise to Google‚Äôs accusations of banal theft. <br><br>  <i>For some users (93 of 94) this answer was useful.</i>  <i>And for you?</i> </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  The question remains about the actual services rendered. <br>  It doesn't matter what Google takes for reality. <br>  In accordance with the Civil Code of the Russian Federation, commercial activities are supposed to reimburse actual costs if the result of the transaction is not achieved.  The deal is obvious, because Google actually provides access to its automated system and the person used it in accordance with the rules, including their DEFINITION, and not a violation. <br>  If the rules for using the system are violated or implied to be such (the Civil Code of the Russian Federation provides for such an attitude), then the financial calculations should proceed properly, not in the same way as Google practices. <br><br>  <i>For some users (40 of 40) this answer was useful.</i>  <i>And for you?</i> </blockquote><br><br>  PS I love Google for a good search, for the development of new useful services, for the introduction of the latest technologies in our daily life and for the logos on the main page.  In this article, I just talked about what faced in reality.  Perhaps this will help someone.  I really hope that it will help, including Google itself, to become better.  Thanks to everyone who read. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> At the request of the participants of the AdSense forum and habravchan I transfer to the blog of Google.  I think it will be right.  Thank you for understanding. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122524/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122524/</a></p>
