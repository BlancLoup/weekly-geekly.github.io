  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Six months of living together or than pleased / upset the smartphone Lenovo s660</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the Internet, many articles and video reviews of this smartphone.  However, most of them only talk about the characteristics and the stated capabilities.  I want to tell you about personal feelings after several months of active life together.  I bought this smartphone about six months ago.  Before that there were various dinosaurs, on which there was an android of the same prehistoric version and even the first version of windows phone (on the first Lumia).  It is worth noting that the phone for me is not a ‚Äúfashionable gadget‚Äù, but only a means for communication and remote control of various services, mobile banks, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/255/15d/c9c/25515dc9c852ccd384d9e1a2c75f01c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Briefly some <b>characteristics</b> : <br><ul><li>  Operating system: <i>Android 4.2</i> </li><li>  Sim card: <i>x2 SIM</i> </li><li>  Display: <i>4.7 ", 960 x 540 pixels, 235 ppi</i> </li><li>  Processor: <i>Mediatek MTK6582M, 4 core Cortex-A7, 1.3 GHz, graphics Mali-400MP</i> </li><li>  RAM: <i>1 GB</i> </li><li>  Flash memory: <i>8 GB</i> </li><li>  Camera: <i>8 MP main, VGA front</i> </li><li>  Wireless technologies: <i>Bluetooth, Wi-Fi</i> </li><li>  GPS: <i>No, only A-GPS</i> </li><li>  Battery: <i>3000 mA / h</i> </li><li>  Dimensions: <i>137x69x10 mm</i> </li><li>  Weight without SIM and memory card: <i>151 g</i> </li></ul><br>  Of course, it‚Äôs impossible to choose a phone in a store (and especially on the Internet) so that it meets all requirements.  They need a couple of months to use.  So, what is this smartphone.  I chose it because in terms of price / quality it seemed to me optimal.  It also supports the use of 2 SIM cards, which is really convenient, and switching between them is very fast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/745/0b4/772/7450b4772d0abbb36f5991f50a1dfae8.jpg" alt="image">

      In terms of its functionality, it competes well with many "propiar" and expensive phones.  The first thing that I liked after the old phones is a relatively large display.  Sometimes in your free time, on a trip or somewhere else, you can sit quietly on the Internet or play without gathering your eyes in a heap.  I think this phone size is optimal.  He is not small and not ‚Äúshovel‚Äù, it is quite normal to ‚Äúfit‚Äù in his pocket.  In the kit it came with a case.  The cover seemed interesting at first, since its rear part immediately reminded me of a building roulette.  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/03d/394/1cc/03d3941cc0911d23fe2b80c44fdb2bc2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The middle plate of the cover, like a roulette bent in half, twisted and formed a stand (shorter as a pigtail).  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e4a/c41/3a4/e4ac413a4aad8aae66e8603902e4c928.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I agree, a handy thing, but the ‚Äúnot solid‚Äù case implies a cluster of fine ‚Äúdirt‚Äù, which eventually scratches the back cover of the phone.  By the way, this back cover seems to be iron, but even this does not save it from scratches.  In short, for half a year, the back cover along the perimeter of the ‚Äúopenness‚Äù of the cover is scratched.  Therefore, it is better to immediately order another one (I ordered a one-piece silicone case). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fa3/048/5d7/fa30485d7614c0b720f7632d42d93146.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also, this phone is not bad in the hand.  For all the time of use, he never fell out of his hands.  You know, there are probably such phones that just slip out of your hands and, as luck would have it, constantly on asphalt.  The main part of the "insides" of the phone takes the battery.  And in fact it is good.  Charge the phone keeps for a very long time.  Of course, different applications require different consumption, but it struck me that using the audio player on a trip of 500 km to full volume, the battery was discharged from 78% to 71%.  Most "heavy" applications, this phone also pulls.  Any kind of 3d games, etc. - here you can also not worry, and the phone practically does not heat up, despite the metal case (cover). <br><br>  There are two cameras in the phone.  The rear camera takes enough high-quality pictures and video.  Compared with 5 m iPhone - I decided that lenovo is better.  In addition, he can make cool HDR photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bdf/530/a9d/bdf530a9d8df96372c5a886df8fc3a27.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, with the front camera everything is different.  Selfies of good quality is unlikely to succeed.  All the same, VGA quality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b16/faa/958/b16faa958d8fe1965bbba7177a79b859.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here is an example video (Full HD): <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JxXy8_Cfv8U%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhggnJ295NUAZ8FTHUue_ARMSGz6tg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The memory in the phone is enough for me, and for whom it is not enough to install a USB flash drive.  There are no problems with this in the phone. <br><br>  As for the main disadvantages.  The first is the GPS navigator.  When the phone is in the apartment (8th floor out of 9), then gps catches satellites well, but when the phone is in the car, the synchronization of the ‚Äúpoint on the map‚Äù always ‚Äújumps‚Äù back and forth while driving.  In other words, to say that gps in the phone is not very powerful.  The same story with the reception of the Internet.  The Internet normally works only with 3GH +.  In 3GH and 3GE, waiting for the page load is not fast. <br><br>  In general, the smartphone is not very "powerful in reception."  But you can look at it from the other side.  The weaker the transmitter, the more harmless the phone.  Somewhere on the Internet even the table used to be with the values ‚Äã‚Äãof the radiation level.  So I think that this phone is certainly no more harmful than others. <br><br>  Another interesting ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù is auto-brightness.  That is, using the light sensor, the phone itself adjusts the brightness of the phone.  However, I can not say that it works in this mode correctly.  Somehow, the phone does not guess with the brightness that would be desirable at one time or another.  Therefore, I use the "manual adjustment" of brightness.  By the way, in sunny weather, the screen is fully readable and everything is visible. <br><br>  By the way, I recently found one more minus.  But this is most likely a "niggle."  For the sake of interest, I decided to make "virtual reality glasses" based on google cardboard.  And after all the settings, I realized that the phone does not have a gyroscope.  Accelerometer is, but there is no gyroscope.  But this, I repeat, is not a very important feature for the phone in essence. <br><br>  <strong>Conclusion</strong> <br>  In principle, I did not find more flaws in this phone for six months.  I am completely satisfied with this phone and I can advise it to everyone (unless of course gps-navigator is not the main thing for you).  It's not buggy, all menus are smooth, an excellent file manager, etc. In my price category, and I bought it for <a href="https://dronk.ru/shorten/hp">$ 115.99</a> ( <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/dronk/blog/369229/">* ref</a> ), this smartphone is considered one of the best (if not the best).
