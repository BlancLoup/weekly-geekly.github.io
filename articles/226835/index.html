On this occasion, we have already published a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/223347/">selection of mobile applications</a> that may be useful to travelers and just relaxing in nature.  But applications are applications, and there are quite a few interesting gadgets in the world besides smartphones and tablets that can decorate a good rest.  See our selection of gadgets for holidays and outdoor activities. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We will not touch smartphones and tablets.  If you are reading this text, then you already belong to a layer of modern, educated people who keep up with the times.  So you have a smartphone and a tablet, and certainly not one by one.  We are sure that you will not forget to take them with you without our advice, otherwise what will you run applications from the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/223347/">above mentioned collection on</a> ?  Talk to other gadgets. <br><br><h1>  Action camera </h1>  Recently, action cameras have become very popular.  These are very small compact video cameras which fasten on clothes or special fastenings and automatically remove everything that happens.  This is useful if you are fond of active sports or extreme entertainment.  Another possible application - as a kind of DVR, if you do not want or can not for some reason hold the camera in their hands.

      For maximum coverage of space in such cameras use wide-angle lenses, therefore, closely spaced objects are greatly distorted.  There are quite a lot of different accessories for such cameras: mounts on the helmet, extension handles for shooting selfies, underwater and protective boxes, etc. <br><br>  The choice of models does not go far beyond all reasonable limits, but you can‚Äôt call it small either.  The best samples shoot video with FullHD resolution and a frequency of 30 frames / sec.  When choosing also recommend to pay attention to: <br><ul><li>  protection from moisture and dust; </li><li>  fastening method; </li><li>  the duration of the work; </li><li>  weight; </li><li>  availability of wireless broadcast on mobile devices; </li><li>  proposed optional accessories. </li></ul><br>  Price range: 3000-17000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ab/35f/ebf/3ab35febfe621d7fa2bc9b4928b724f9.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Portable speaker </h1>  These gadgets are becoming increasingly popular.  The days of the huge boombox recorders that <s>black guys</s> wore on the shoulder were music lovers in nature a long time ago.  To provide a small company with music away from computers and music centers, today there is a pretty good portable speaker and a selection of your favorite music on your smartphone or tablet. <br><br>  Some speakers compensate for their small size with built-in vibration dynamics to provide bass.  It is enough to place the gadget on the table or stick it on the door, and these surfaces will perform the function of a peculiar sound amplifier.  Larger portable speakers cost on their own, pretty well reproducing low frequencies. <br><br>  When choosing, pay attention to: <br><ul><li>  the width of the reproduced range; </li><li>  weight; </li><li>  the size; </li><li>  battery life; </li><li>  dust and moisture protection. </li></ul><br>  Price range: 200‚Äî12000 rub. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b30/221/696/b30221696e3f41bc264207a670538cf5.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Mobile router </h1>  If you do not spend your vacation completely separated from civilization, you have access to a cellular network and you need internet, then you may need a mobile router.  A compact device that uses a SIM card and distributes traffic over Wi-Fi.  The benefit here is in saving the charge of smartphones and tablets, as well as in the possibility of simultaneous connection to the Internet of several devices through a single SIM card.  In addition, in the zone of unstable reception, you will not need to catch a stronger signal with your smartphone, it is enough to put or hang up a router here, and you yourself can comfortably be located nearby.  But do not forget roaming does not sleep. <br><br>  When choosing, pay attention to: <br><ul><li>  battery life; </li><li>  the ability to use 4G networks. </li></ul><br>  Price range: 800-6000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/69d/b61/b49/69db61b49708f17686c377f44ea5c011.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Portable accumulator </h1>  Popular wisdom says, the farther into the forest - the angrier woodpeckers.  In our time, a long separation from populated areas threatens not only a meeting with an inhospitable fauna, but a complete exhaustion of the batteries of all gadgets.  With all the consequences.  Well, if you lose just music or books.  And if you relied on navigation using a smartphone / tablet, and suddenly you remained in the middle of an unknown location with a ‚Äúdead‚Äù device? <br><br>  Save the situation can a portable battery of large capacity, with which it is easy to recharge other gadgets.  The main thing is not to forget before traveling / hike charge the portable battery itself.  On the market now there are many offers of such devices of various form factors, from wristbands to cylinders and boxes of any sizes and colors. <br><br>  When choosing, pay attention to: <br><ul><li>  availability of a solar battery for recharging; </li><li>  Battery capacity; </li><li>  size and weight; </li><li>  the number and types of connectors; </li><li>  resistance to shock and moisture; </li><li>  presence of an indicator of the current charge level; </li></ul><br>  Price range: 400-6000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/965/be4/f77/965be4f7712ce55b6cb2de54259c01bd.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Passive Chargers </h1>  This term refers to gadgets that convert thermal or kinetic energy into electrical energy.  If your laptop battery is dead and you don‚Äôt have a solar battery or the sky is overcast, a solution for real survivors can help.  For example, you can use a portable dynamo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56d/48f/ddf/56d48fddf87739e971c25d5b0fd60410.jpg"><br><br>  Or thermoelectric charger.  In order not to waste gas cylinders in the campaign for boiling water alone, you can recharge the navigator or reader. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dec/f9e/ad7/decf9ead7df4474b52b5e59fd75ee28d.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Universal cigarette lighter charger </h1>  A very useful gadget for all lovers of traveling by car.  It is an adapter from a standard cigarette lighter connector with a bunch of various plugs. <br><br>  When choosing, pay attention to: <br><ul><li>  the number and composition of the supplied plugs; </li><li>  availability of USB ports. </li></ul><br>  Price range: 50‚Äî2000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f7/0bb/eaa/2f70bbeaae8f16c0452764d3f105e78b.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Quadcopter </h1>  Perhaps someone will consider this not a gadget, but a toy.  But if you decide to install an action camera on a quadrocopter and take pictures of a strong sparrow from the height of the flight, then this is already quite an instrument and a real gadget. <br><br>  When choosing, pay attention to: <br><ul><li>  load capacity; </li><li>  battery life; </li><li>  range of the control panel; </li><li>  propeller security. </li></ul><br>  Price range: 1500-60000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a98/f92/67b/a98f9267bc7b3e33a80daf83bc91c399.jpg"><br><br><h1>  External optics for smartphones </h1>  If you for some reason do not want to use a separate camera and prefer to shoot on a smartphone, then thanks to external optics you will be able to significantly improve the quality of photos.  Of course, this is not so compact and efficient, but still the photos are our memories.  And it is better to make the memories sharp, with good color reproduction and with minimal noises. <br><br>  What to hide, almost all lenses for smartphones are made specifically for iPhones.  But we believe that it will be fair to talk only about universal gadgets.  Unfortunately, it is impossible to create a lens for any smartphone.  So we are, in fact, talking about a special external compact camera that transmits images to a smartphone via Wi-Fi. <br><br>  Price range: 6000-17000 rub. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f4/56a/8ff/9f456a8ff1b1251739365915dda4542f.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Active Noise Canceling Headphones </h1>  A great gadget not only for holidays, but also for everyday use in public transport.  When you turn on the external noise cancellation system, you almost stop hearing the sounds of the world around you in these headphones.  This does not mean that you find yourself in complete silence, but listening to music becomes much more comfortable. <br><br>  When choosing, pay attention to: <br><ul><li>  headphone form factor; </li><li>  convenience of controls; </li><li>  the need to use additional power sources for the operation of the noise reduction system; </li><li>  frequency range. </li></ul><br>  Price range: 2000-19000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d75/522/cba/d75522cba7e81f9e95db9f8707034f03.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Portable coffee machine </h1>  A gadget for gourmets who cannot live a day without a cup of freshly brewed coffee.  And what should such people do when there is nothing within a radius of 200 km, except for the soluble horror advertised under the guise of ‚Äúgenuine Brazilian coffee‚Äù? <br><br>  When choosing, pay attention to: <br><ul><li>  the need for a power source; </li><li>  the presence and capacity of the water tank. </li></ul><br>  Price range: 3000-8000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/641/b82/fd5/641b82fd5c673c239c478aef423a061c.jpg"><br><br><h1>  UV Sterilizer </h1>  If you go hiking in the southern latitudes, or as tourists to third world countries, we recommend to purchase an ultraviolet water sterilizer.  For billions of people, we, the people of Russia, are northerners, spoiled by an abundance of pure water.  Therefore, the regions that are not so lucky from this point of view should be prepared.  It is best to drink only factory-packed water that was not opened without your knowledge.  If you do not have access to such water, then the sterilizer is not very superfluous. <br><br>  When choosing, pay attention to: <br><ul><li>  power; </li><li>  possibility of battery operation </li></ul><br>  Price range: 4000‚Äî10000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90e/66c/185/90e66c185bb35720383baf54fa8b19a6.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Pocket printer </h1>  In our age of electronic photographs, books, newspapers and music, analog data carriers are already becoming, if not exotic, then a wonder.  And it's good that there are still quite a few people who appreciate not a picture on the screen, which will disappear along with a dead battery, but an imprint.  For example, photos.  And if you really want to quickly print your pictures, share them with friends, then take a look at pocket printers. <br><br>  When choosing, pay attention to: <br><ul><li>  availability of consumables; </li><li>  print format; </li><li>  The ability to wirelessly transfer files. </li></ul><br>  Price range: 4000-8000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b91/a93/0ad/b91a930ad97a651ec3e7bbda39b7d1fb.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Pocket projector </h1>  If you don‚Äôt carry a tablet or a laptop with you, and you want to watch a movie, you can use a pocket projector instead of staring at a smartphone screen.  At the same time, your companions will not be deprived of entertainment.  And in the evenings, you can review photos taken during the day through this projector.  The main thing is to find a piece of vertical light flat surface. <br><br>  When choosing, pay attention to: <br><ul><li>  image resolution; </li><li>  wireless connectivity; </li><li>  battery life; </li><li>  maximum brightness. </li></ul><br>  Price range: 5000-25000 rubles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a7b/61c/6c5/a7b61c6c51428434a1e44a0df725f4f9.jpg"><br><br>  This, in our opinion, is a list of interesting gadgets for every vacationer.  Of course, if you wish, you can load a lot more than that, but this already depends on taste and individual needs.  And what of the gadgets would you suggest to take with you?  Laptops / smartphones / tablets do not offer. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/226835/">https://habr.com/ru/post/226835/</a></p>
