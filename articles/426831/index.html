Sit down. <br><br>  The owner was gloomy.  The eyebrows are flattened, the movements are sharp, a severe grimace is set on her face.  The call to the meeting was a complete surprise, and Sergei could not understand what was the reason for it.  In addition, his thoughts were far away - the last two days he had been working on the task of forming bar codes, in total immersion, not really delving into what was happening around.  Stas took care of the entire routine. <br><br>  - What happened, Evgeny Viktorovich?  - Sergey asked cautiously, sitting down opposite the owner.

      - Tell us about the progress of the project at the warehouse. <br><br>  Evgeny Viktorovich asked this question without looking at Sergey.  Bad sign.  Sergey had an unpleasant chill on his back, his palms were sweating frantically - it‚Äôs good that he managed to shake hands with the owner earlier. <br><br>  - Everything goes according to plan.  - the tongue moved heavily in a parched mouth.  - Now I am engaged in automation of control. <br><br>  - Using barcodes? <br><br>  - BUT? <br><br>  This is the only thing Sergey could say.  Here is a cudgel, he thought.  Confused, like a schoolboy, whose mother found cigarettes in his pocket.  But where is he from ... <br><br>  - How will the barcode help clean up the stock?  - Evgeny Viktorovich, finally, turned to Sergey and stared at him point-blank. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  - Barcode is an essential element of the system we are building.  - Sergey mumbled. <br><br>  And then he thought - no, not so.  You can not pretend that it should be.  How does he know?  In the working version of the barcode system yet, no one was not discussed. <br><br>  - Where do you know about barcodes?  - plucking up courage, Sergey asked carefully. <br><br>  - Sergey, I am the owner.  I know everything, or almost everything that happens in a company.  Details are not important, let it be my secret.  Another bothers me. <br><br>  Yevgeny Viktorovich paused, still looking intently at Sergei.  As if he wanted him to guess what was bothering him there.  Sergey decided to keep quiet so as not to start a meaningless quiz. <br><br>  - When you volunteered to do this project, do you remember what you said? <br><br>  - What will do it. <br><br>  - It's clear.  I, if you remember, then doubted.  You are a programmer, and in such a project you have to be something, or something else - wider, bigger, more active.  Work with people, restructure processes, negotiate, convince.  And what do I hear now?  Again about automation. <br><br>  Sergey was silent.  The meaning of the conversation became obvious, and one question remained - where would he lead.  Removed from the project?  Removed from project management?  What to say?  Try to convince?  Butt? <br><br>  - Sergey, the project is very important.  - interrupted the thoughts of the programmer Yevgeny Viktorovich.  - And I, as his customer, have reasonable doubts about success.  I am sure that automation does not restore order. <br><br>  - Evgeny Viktorovich.  - hell, his mouth is completely dry.  I had to pause for a couple of seconds to restore my ability to speak.  - With all due respect ... You mentioned our conversation, but there still sounded different. <br><br>  - What exactly? <br><br>  - Non-standard approach.  I said that I know how to put things in order.  And I do not refuse my words.  I still know how to do it.  And I did not say that I would manage with automation and bar codes alone.  I didn‚Äôt say anything at all yet, and now we are taking the phrase out of context, and we are trying to discuss the project‚Äôs progress on it.  Not even a phrase, but one word - these unfortunate barcodes. <br><br>  The more Sergey said, the more he gained confidence.  The owner was silent for now, and the programmer decided to take advantage of this by continuing the pressure. <br><br>  - You judge what I do, on scraps of information.  Moreover, it is not clear where they came from.  What did they tell you about the barcode? <br><br>  - I do not understand ... - the owner was a little taken aback. <br><br>  - Well, did someone tell you about him?  What exactly?  What words sounded there? <br><br>  ‚ÄúNot literally, but ... What did you decide to establish order by entering bar coding?‚Äù <br><br>  - Where?  Where am I going to apply it? <br><br>  - Where I am from ... Listen, Sergey.  - the owner abruptly changed the tone, and the minute confusion disappeared like a hand.  - Are you trying to catch me in words?  What kind of conversation are we having with you now? <br><br>  - I do not know, Evgeny Viktorovich.  Someone has misplaced something for you, it is unclear for what purpose, and I have to sit and make excuses. <br><br>  At first, Sergei portrayed the offense artificially, but now it has become real. <br><br>  - I do not want you to make excuses.  - softened the owner.  - I just want to understand what is happening. <br><br>  - I will have a big request for you: if you want to know what is happening, ask me. <br><br>  - Listen, Sergey ... - Evgeny began to lose his temper.  - You, by chance, star fever has not started?  No one hears us, so for the first time, I will confine myself to oral remarks.  Don't talk to me like that.  The fact that I entrusted you with the project does not mean that you can act autonomously, and even more so - to snap and teach me how to lead.  And the company, and the project, and you. <br><br>  - Evgeny Viktorovich.  - Sergey gathered will into a fist.  - I either do the project as I see fit, or do not do it at all.  For that matter, I'll quit.  But I will not work on the patterns of those who already, sorry, pissed away this task.  And I do not care who and what thinks.  If you show me at least one person who, in at least one process, has brought a clear, manageable and stable order, I will gladly take an example from him.  But, as long as only intriguers, hats, efficient managers, and other senseless characters walk around me, and around you, I will act as I see fit.  What is the point of listening to those who have not done a damn good for the company? <br><br>  - I do not like your tone, Sergey. <br><br>  - I also do not like my tone, Evgeny Viktorovich.  I thought that I would be engaged in business, and not participate in intrigues.  I do not know how, I am a programmer.  And I know my business.  Intrigue order is not induced. <br><br>  - What is the suggestion? <br><br>  - System management, alignment and control of processes, a clear course of action, transparency, automation and measurement. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe words are clear and correct, but ...‚Äù <br><br>  - This ‚Äúbut‚Äù, Evgeny Viktorovich, also hinders.  Ask any manager of yours, from effective ones, he will list the same words, and this will add ‚Äúbut‚Äù too.  But garbage is everything, but the main thing is people, but everything will be rested against the will of the leadership, but the staff will not be redone, but still they will spoil everything, but I did everything I could. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYes, I understand what you are saying, but ...‚Äù the owner relented. <br><br>  - What is "but"?  - Sergey asked with a smile. <br><br>  ‚ÄúHmm ...‚Äù Evgeny Viktorovich smiled back, but then he became serious again.  - But you and me understand.  All your words sound beautiful, and, nevertheless, there is a "but."  I can not, do not want, I will not act blindly.  You said that you would quit - it‚Äôs beautiful, of course, it sounds, and the gesture will be spectacular, but ... What should I do then?  Again, someone from the managers to assign?  Another programmer?  Consultants call?  Do yourself?  How long will this go on?  And you will be in other companies, at interviews, tell what a fine fellow you are, how great it was, and then fell victim to intrigue and politics. <br><br>  Sergey became thoughtful.  About the dismissal, indeed, he lost his temper.  It turned out that he was a kind of muslin lady, who could not be touched with a finger - he would immediately burst into tears and run away. <br><br>  - About the dismissal, I did not mean it.  - He tried to explain.  ‚ÄúI'm not going, and I don't want to leave.‚Äù  Just wanted to indicate that I, like you, play all-in.  Not looking for alternate paths, not laying straws, not making any friends in the company who will save me.  There is only me, and the project. <br><br>  - Perhaps in vain.  - the owner again turned to the window.  - I'm talking about friends.  And politics, and intrigue.  I will give you advice if you will allow (Evgeny Viktorovich turned, looked at Sergey and smiled).  Do not ignore the policy.  Otherwise, you will always be offended, reticent, engineer hating the whole world.  I do not say that politics should be loved, but it should be understood and used for its own purposes.  Some tasks are much easier to solve by talking to people.  For example, we would not have this conversation, if you understood - you need to keep the leader informed about the work.  Now, I hope you understand that? <br><br>  - Yes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThen the conversation wouldn't have happened at all.‚Äù  When she ... Well, in general, someone would come to me and began to say something about your work, I would know what to say, because I would have information.  You have to anticipate the development of events, keep in mind the entire map of the area, with roads, swamps and places for ambushes.  Then you will become a really cool manager. <br><br>  - cool?  - Sergey smiled.  - Or effective? <br><br>  - Call it what you want.  - the owner shrugged. <br><br>  - And if I do not want?  Manager become.  After all, you have painted the portrait of an ordinary manager, right?  Who knows everything about everyone, participates in all intrigues, everywhere he has acquaintances, debtors, and so on.  He does his best to remain a manager, and, on occasion, to rise upwards.  But he lacks one thing - he does not know how to work.  Unless, of course, not to consider work this is all that you called politics. <br><br>  Evgeny Viktorovich sighed, looked down at the table and began to look at his fingers.  Sergey also looked at these fingers - well-groomed, thin, without a single flaw.  Interesting, is it a manicure?  Or whatever it is called ... <br><br>  - I do not know what to answer you.  - the owner has lifted eyes.  - It seems you are right, but the feeling that I am talking to a romantic young man does not leave me.  Or Don Quixote.  Of course, any owner and manager dreams of an employee who is able to restore order, improve performance, move the company forward, and at the same time completely devoid of career and political aspirations.  But does that happen? <br><br>  - I do not know.  - Sergey shrugged his shoulders.  - But the absence of such people among friends does not mean that it is not necessary to try.  I will try to become so.  Career, in the traditional sense, is not interesting for me.  Well, there to become a cool manager, sit at meetings, puff out his cheeks, pour in clever terms, yell at subordinates, and so on, from the recruitment of an effective manager.  In the end, arguing purely mercantile, there are very many such people. <br><br>  - Well, yes, it is a red ocean.  - nodded the owner.  - With strict laws, rules ... Or rather, without rules. <br><br>  - I'd rather swim in the blue ocean.  There is nobody there.  Programmers in their red ocean, managers in theirs.  And to put things in order, to make the processes effective, I am not able to either or the other.  So let them swim, bite and fight.  And I'll do it. <br><br>  - Good.  - Evgeny Viktorovich decided to stop the conversation.  - Did you hear my promise? <br><br>  - Yes, and not one. <br><br>  - Good.  - smiled the owner.  - I hope we will no longer have such conversations. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  - Yes Pebbles, who else ... <br><br>  After a meeting with the owner, half an hour had already passed, but Sergey could not calm down.  From talking about the boss, the mood was getting worse, emotions were boiling, I didn‚Äôt want to work.  Inside was an unpleasant, oppressive emptiness.  Not to say that it was as if the knife had been thrust into the back ‚Äî nevertheless, Galina was more likely to belong to the category of enemies, but Sergey‚Äôs inexperience in corporate games made itself felt ‚Äî every such case was a mess for a long time. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMaybe not her?‚Äù  - cautiously asked Stas. <br><br>  - Who else?  Are you?  As soon as she found out ... <br><br>  - Well ... - Stas shrugged.  - Well, to hell with her, let's do the project.  What is next? <br><br>  - I do not know.  - Sergey closed his eyes, leaned back in his chair, threw back his head.  - What's the difference? <br><br>  - Well, I'm interested.  Here you did barcodes.  Did by the way? <br><br>  - Yes.  Everywhere I threw, for all warehouse documents.  Paper painted. <br><br>  - What are the next steps?  What are you planning? <br><br>  Sergey was silent.  I did not want to think about work.  What the hell are the steps?  With Galina have a fight to go?  What's the point?  She otmazhtsya shark old.  You start to stick to the wall, crush, argue, arrange a tantrum - to her, as a woman, this technique is available. <br><br>  - Well?  Why are you silent? <br><br>  - I do not want to talk. <br><br>  - Yes, good you are!  Dropped out like ... Come on, pull yourself together, a rag!  Get off the machine! <br><br>  - In terms of? <br><br>  ‚ÄúWell, like in Love and Doves, remember?‚Äù  Throw dumki something on the farm.  There you will hitch something up, you can do something about it ... And longing will pass. <br><br>  Sergey attentively looked at Stas for a few seconds.  Maybe he is right?  Dropped, really ... <br><br>  - Okay.  - Sergey abruptly jumped up from the chair.  So sharply that in the eyes at first darkened, and then glowing points floating in the air became visible.  Damn, this was not enough ... Sergey closed his eyes, stood for a minute, holding on to the wall.  Opened - it seems light, stars do not fly. <br><br>  - So.  - Sergey began in a slightly extinct voice.  - There are barriers.  Need to buy a scanner.  Order?  You said you figure it out. <br><br>  - And then!  What do you want?  Stationary?  Wireless? <br><br>  - The cheapest, easiest, with the connection over the wire.  He will stand at Dasha, in stock.  And wait ... Just do not connect it right away - first to me.  And then I did the barcodes, but I didn‚Äôt even check how they are scanned. <br><br>  - Got it.  - Stas nodded and wrote something down in a detachable notebook with a beautiful logo in the form of a cube. <br><br>  - Good.  Next you need to determine the point where this scanner will work. <br><br>  - What is it like?  You said that Dasha will have it. <br><br>  - I am not talking about physical points, but about control points, in the process.  We also need a barcode not to identify documents, but to check the paper with the system, by checksum. <br><br>  - What? <br><br>  - Damn, Stas, do not be stupid.  We discussed this two days ago. <br><br>  - Hmm ... Maybe I misunderstood what ... I thought for identification. <br><br>  - Oh mother honest.  - Sergey sighed.  ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt understand where to him ...‚Äù <br><br>  - To whom? <br><br>  - No one.  All right, the rest later.  Order a scanner. <br><br>  - Good. <br><br>  Sergey sat down at the computer, opened the development environment and started poking around in the code. <br><br>  - Listen, I can go on a personal matter?  - asked Stas. <br><br>  - In terms of? <br><br>  - Well, there it is ... Buy something that is necessary. <br><br>  - What do I have to do with this?  I'm not your boss.  Go, I do not mind. <br><br>  - Cover, if what? <br><br>  - Yes. <br><br>  Stas got up, straightened his clothes, shoved his smartphone into his pocket and, slowly, went to the exit. <br><br>  What's next, what's next ... Sergey tried to focus on work, but his thoughts all the time ran off into the distance - where the gloomy owner was talking about politics, intrigues, swamps and the project. <br><br>  The sensations were twofold.  On the one hand, being an introvert by popular classification, Sergey terribly, fiercely, with all his heart resisted.  On the other hand, he understood that, at least in part, Yevgeny Viktorovich was right.  But to connect these two poles did not work. <br><br>  But the brain engineer did not want to give up.  Any task has a solution - he said.  Even if it lies in the field of human relations, and not in the software code and chips. <br><br>  Policy will have to do, but how?  Catching confidence, dating, flattering, threatening, collecting dirt?  Lord, what a disgusting words ... As if talking about the inhabitants of the terrarium - vile, disgusting, slippery reptiles.  And they like someone ... They study them, grow them, set up experiments. <br><br>  Listen ... - Sergey said to himself.  Maybe in this salt?  The key, guess the approach?  As they are called ... <br><br>  Sergey opened the browser, spent a few minutes surfing, and finally found what he was looking for.  A herpetologist is a scientist who studies amphibians and reptiles.  Scientist, engineer, programmer - in essence, what is the difference?  This same herpetologist knows about the reptiles everything that is possible.  But he does not climb into the terrarium himself, does not eat flies, does not shed his skin. <br><br>  Sergey liked the idea so much that he even began to smile.  From the side, probably, looked very stupid, but who cares?  There was no one in the office. <br><br>  I will study these reptiles as a scientist.  - Sergey argued with himself.  The word, of course, stupid - reptiles, gives a sense of their own superiority, which Sergei did not have.  Or was it?  Life will show. <br><br>  So, where to start ... Read something on this topic?  Reluctance ... Damn!  Why read if a suitable reptile, or rather a reptile, is sitting on the floor above?  We must go, watch! <br><br>  And the reason?  You will not come just like that, given the extremely strained relations ... So, the reason, the reason ... <br><br>  Sergei opened the task management system, looked at the list of not accepted in the work.  Over the past two days, while picking with barcodes, the list has grown significantly - Stas could not take on some of the tasks.  A little thought, Sergei chose one that was from Galina.  I read it, tried to understand it - it was not always easy, Galina did not differ in the ability to clearly set tasks for programmers, because she herself was not.  But, in this case, the muddled description of the requirements played into the hands - many questions appeared.  Here you can discuss them! <br><br>  After printing, just in case, the text of the task, Sergey went to the second floor.  Inside, a pleasant feeling flared up - a discoverer, a researcher, and another, unfamiliar before, feeling like a conscious provocateur. <br><br>  When he reached Galina's office, Sergey knocked on the door.  Hearing a loud, annoyed "Yes!", Entered. <br><br>  In the office, at a huge table, sat Galina.  On the contrary, Stas was sitting in the visitor‚Äôs chair. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/426831/">https://habr.com/ru/post/426831/</a></p>
