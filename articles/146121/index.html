  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Month with Nokia Lumia 710 and Windows Phone 7</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  Introductory </h4><br>  Month as I became the owner of white lumiya and this is my first wp7 smartphone.  Prior to this, the android smart was long and tediously, after the latter finally got out with its endless glitches and the need not to go far from the outlet, decided to change something drastically. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, I formulated my requirements: <br><br><ul><li>  Half a hundred applications for each bunch in the phone is a floppy, I read the news on the tablet.  I play on the BB or the same tablet, I photograph it with a normal good fotik, I read books on the tablet, I watch movies on TV. </li><li>  What is important is convenient work with contacts (of which there are many), given the fact that the number of numbers per contact reaches five + a bunch of accompanying information.  Not a buggy telephone part - in this sense, my android took it hard, sometimes he simply refused to dial the number. </li><li>  What is very important - convenient "operational" work with email.  It is operational - read, write a couple of lines in response.  All that is more complicated requires a normal keyboard and at least 22 inches of space.  All mail is in my gmail (3 accounts). Again, my android let me down - once a week I received a stable message ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt send mail‚Äù and now you can‚Äôt do the reset - nivkakuyu. </li><li>  Navigation - very important, automobile, bicycle, "leg".  Ukraine, Kiev.  Ideally offline. </li><li>  Twitter - there is such a weakness to drop. </li><li>  Perhaps all. </li></ul><br><br>  Also.  what is important - intuitiveness and simplicity, I do not want to delve into the wisdom of the interface, study the configuration settings and read in the internet what kind of launcher "all progressive humanity" uses.  Not mine, you need a utilitarian reliable WELL apparatus that performs 5-6 functions, so that I would remember about it only when I need one of these functions, if it is with a certain degree of aesthetics - ‚Äúidealochka‚Äù (s).

      <br>
      In general, as you can guess, Android got me tight :) I decided to look at the ‚Äúalternative‚Äù platforms - Bada, iOS, WP7. <br><br>  Bada is a step in the past, not even a step - a jump.  Everything seems to work, but I did these interfaces during MIDP-JavaME. <br><br>  iOS is good, convenient, sometimes primitive (IMHO, the interface is too unified for the sake of aesthetics and not convenience) BUT, I need a phone and not status crap for 100500ue, I don‚Äôt see all those benefits that could justify THIS price, it's just phone !!!! .. By the way, I have oypad and consider it to be the crown of engineering thought and I beat off my price by 150%. <br><br>  WP7 - fortunately, my good friend, then still working in the company of Naki, changed the corporate symbian to corporate wp7 for the sake of the corporate standard, one of his first reactions (independent we emphasize :)) then it was ‚Äúit does everything! !!  all I need to eat and fast. ‚Äù  I also twisted it in my hands, first Lumia 800, then 710 and then 900. Somehow it was so clear and pleasant that it turned out that the price tag on the 710 seemed somehow unreal, because for about that time I bought a budget Android designer "Try and you our sweet beta-rolls." <br><br>  I firmly decided that my new smart will be wp7, it remains to decide with the vendor and model, after reading the review, it turned out that Nokia has <s>excellent</s> (I agree not great but just have) offline navigation, the rest only have online Google, Bing, Yandex.  At the same time, Nokia is hardly cheaper than others, as-without options. <br><br>  Now, the 900 model seemed so unrealistically huge that the price no longer played a role (I still don‚Äôt know how much it costs), 800 is good, sooo good, everything is nice except the price.  The price is, in general, perhaps justified, but 710 on the same hardware with the same software costs almost 2 times cheaper !!!  The difference with the 800 in the case, the camera and a small battery.  A little later, there was another argument against the 800 - the built-in non-removable battery itself, the second one, you will not take the second one with you. <br><br>  About the choice of color - it is white because it‚Äôs white, like that + the designated friend at the end also had 710 but remained in the black case and in order not to be confused after Friday-festive libations ... still white, not pink in the end. <br><br>  All introductory ended, <br><br><h4>  Impressions after a month </h4><br>  BEHIND <br><br><ol><li>  In the first week I firmly shuned it on the asphalt with a sweep, the glass survived (Gorilla Glass BTW) BUT the corner got a noticeable dent, which is why the battery cover now has a barely noticeable gap with the body but still does not creak or crunch. </li><li>  He did not bug, that's true, for a month he never in any scenarios did not bang, this is very unusual after the android. </li><li>  I'm still not accustomed to the fact that only the power button I can turn on the screen, this is a chuck. </li><li>  He is beautiful, I like Pts, despite all the budget - good materials (the same Gorilla Glass) is a nice case. </li><li>  He is fast, everything flies, no lags are noticed, it very much protects the nerves shattered by work. </li><li>  Excellent complete headset - vacuum, listening to music is a pleasure. </li><li>  Absolutely all the software I needed was in the market and for free (Skype, IM +, Facebook, Twitter, Foursquare, Yandex maps, evernote, Gismeteo :), Tonido, Wunderlist). </li><li>  UI is intuitive sho just kapets. </li><li>  Small UIs that make life more pleasant, for example, the envelope of a new email on the lock screen each box appears in its place and you can see it at work (urgent) or personal (waiting) or tap notifications that are ‚Äúremembered‚Äù before the lock is unlocked Scrin well and so. </li><li>  Built-in twitter, facebook, linkedin synchronizer. </li><li>  The combination of fb messenger and sms, a great answer iMessages. </li><li>  Autonomy - about 28-30 hours 100% online (70% Wifi, 30% 3G) with ugly operation uila uvel (the phone transmitter almost always has 100% capacity + regular national roaming), this is 2-3 times more than my past android in the same conditions. </li></ol><br><br>  VS <br><br><ol><li>  It feels that some aspects of the UI are unfinished (so completely inadequately-useless search). </li><li>  Strange mode of illumination in Nokia (xs can this is a feature of wp7) - it ‚Äúflickers‚Äù with a white background fill. </li><li>  The lack of a black email client theme. </li><li>  Children's bugs wp7 - the worst bug in the mail client makes a practically non-working bundle of gmail + push + RU.  I had to give up pushing in favor of synchronization </li></ol><br><br>  In general, I am 100% satisfied with the phone and he is 100% satisfied with everything. <br><br>  PS I have nothing to do with nokia (except for the aforementioned friend who no longer works there), nor with MS (misers - my books have been squeezed). <br><br>  PPS Ok, I was convinced that the android here I dragged in vain, we will assume that these are just impressions of my particular situation in the case of two defective phones (LG P500 and Samsung Gio girls) and they do not relate to the general situation in the hospital, the whole thing is only about luminescence and the android has nothing to do with it. <br><br>  UPDATE about the tram with gmail and its solution: <a href="http://sorokoletov.com/2012/04/windows-phone-7-gmail-fail/">sorokoletov.com/2012/04/windows-phone-7-gmail-fail</a> <br>  <a href="http://sorokoletov.com/2012/05/correct-configuration-google-mail-for-windows-phone-7/">sorokoletov.com/2012/05/correct-configuration-google-mail-for-windows-phone-7</a> <br>  (I have no relation to the site, the first thing I found in Google) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146121/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146121/</a></p>
