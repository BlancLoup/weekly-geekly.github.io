In October, 23% of companies indicated that they had already completed the optimization process.  In the next 3-6 months, only 14% of employers plan to make reductions. <br><br>  In October, 43% of employers said they did not plan to conduct an active search for new employees in the next six months and would open vacancies only to replace vacant positions.  The hiring of new employees was suspended in 13% of companies, 24% of employers surveyed announced plans to increase staff.

      More than half of the respondents reported that they plan to increase salaries to their employees in 2016. <a name="habracut"></a>  86% of international companies and 59% of Russian companies are planning an increase.  A salary increase of 9% or more is planned for 12% of Russian and 33% of international companies.  About the absence of plans to raise salaries in 2016 was told by 5% of international and 27% of Russian companies. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMost companies have already made reductions and are now adapting to the current situation.  They try to at least not lose their part of the business and, if possible, strengthen their positions in the market, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/business/09/11/2015/564083f69a79472cefc1fe95">said</a> partner of Antal Russia Vera Filatova. <br><br>  According to her, employers are ready to strengthen their teams with professionals, but they want to get ready-made high-level specialists - with knowledge of a specific market, with a well-established base of customers or with ideas that can be put into practice in their business. <br><br>  The study was conducted from 5 to 15 October through an online survey.  200 Russian and international companies operating in Russia from 16 sectors of the economy were surveyed. <br><br>  Most of the cuts this year were expected by employees of the automotive sector (65%), financial services (66%) and the public sector (63%).  The employees of chemical enterprises (63%), agriculture (62%) and health care (57%) are least afraid of cuts. <br><br>  In mid-October, the PWC PayWell 2015 payroll survey showed that Russian companies failed to achieve the wage growth announced at the beginning of the year to compensate for inflation by 7% - in real terms, staff income in 2014‚Äì2015 <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/business/16/10/2015/56206d349a794738322d8b4e">decreased</a> by 6%. <br><br>  With regard to the international IT market, it stands out a number of the most popular and highly paid areas.  According <a href="http://www.pcweek.ru/management/article/detail.php%3FID%3D179711">to a</a> study by <a href="http://www.roberthalf.com/technology">Robert Half Technology</a> , in 2016 such areas will be mobility, big data, security and application development. <br><br>  The growing need for IT professionals leads to the fact that employers in North America have for months to find a key specialist.  A new trend here is that candidates basically do not come to a whole range of positions, because every high-class specialist, who has not even been noticed in an active job search, today receives a number of proposals. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296164/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296164/</a></p>
