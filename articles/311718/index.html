This question tormented me for a long time.  It was always interesting to know: how much do other games earn?  If you are also plagued by such questions, then welcome under the cut - there will be some text, no water - just on business <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81f/6f7/c97/81f6f7c97bb14977944a702e9e143434.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have a simple quiz game, which is listed in two categories of the Russian app store: "Quiz" and "Puzzle".  The game was launched for about six months, in August, I made a change of the icon, the name and perevylozhil this miracle.  Recently, I decided to test the performance of my store and made a test purchase for 29 rubles.  After a while, I was greatly surprised to find that the application had risen to 34th place in the ranking of top-grossing games of the Quiz category. <br><br>  It became interesting and I decided to try to find answers to two questions:

    <ol><li>  How much should you earn to enter the top cash register of your category? </li><li>  How many organic installations will be in the top cash register in the category "Quizzes"? </li></ol><br><h1>  1. How much should I earn to enter the Top Box Office of my category? </h1><br>  I decided to conduct a purely scientific experiment - make purchases by myself and see where I can get without significant losses for my personal budget.  There is no exact algorithm for calculating top cash registers in the public domain, there are suggestions (for example, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/150702/">here</a> ) that it is built on the basis of sales for several days, taking into account weights.  Before the experiment, I was not present in the top cash register, all purchases were made in the Russian app store. <br><br>  Below is a table of promotion in the top by day, speaking for itself.  On September 29, I made several payments with an interval of time and therefore I selected them in several lines: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0a/5d1/d8a/b0a5d1d8a1c548e3acf23f51073f4e4b.PNG"></div><br>  screenshot of my sensortower application categories: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee2/682/802/ee268280280a45619e09431358fe2525.png"><br><br>  <b>Based on the experiment, we can draw a fairly obvious conclusion 1:</b> <b><br></b>  <b>To get to the top cash register of Russia in the category is not difficult at all - it is enough to have purchases for 1100 rubles for four days.</b>  <b>In this case, with such a sum, you will find yourself in the region of 300 places in the top cash games</b> <br><br><h1>  2. How many organic installations will be in top cash registers in the category ‚ÄúQuizzes‚Äù? </h1><br>  And now we are smoothly approaching the second, equally important, and perhaps even more interesting question.  To be honest, this list is rather inconsistent from the user's point of view.  I rarely go into it to choose an interesting game.  But as a developer, I practically live in it.  Therefore, it was very interesting to find out what this top gives. <br>  I can not say that my game was a great success.  For example, this is a download schedule for the week of the experiment.  Below is a line with the increase in downloads compared with the previous week. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/783/099/fe5/783099fe5e444be7a6a9cc39b78cbd50.png"><br><br>  As can be seen from the screenshot, sales increased by 8%, which, based on the total small volumes, can be called just an accident. <br><br>  Below is a graph of entry into the "Quiz" category according to Sensortower: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/740/55d/5c2/74055d5c2ea64c21ab3ff2ae435d8781.png"><br><br>  As can be seen from the graph, during the period when the application was raised to the top cash register in the top download category, it even fell. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion 2: being in the top cash category "Quizzes" will not give almost any increase in installations.</b> <br><br>  In conclusion, I can say that I don‚Äôt see any sense in spending money on promotion in top cash registers in this way, if anyone has a different experience, I would be glad to know about it in the comments or in a personal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311718/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311718/</a></p>
