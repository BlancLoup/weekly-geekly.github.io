Two thousand years before this powerful shock, the world of ancient Greek mathematics experienced. <br><br>  The troubles of the Pythagoreans did not begin immediately.  The scientific school founded by Pythagoras ended badly in the end, but today's story is not about the vigorous pogrom that was perpetrated over the Pythagoreans by the thankful people for their enlightenment, but to a greater degree about the spiritual upheavals. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The term "scientific school" in relation to an organization founded by Pythagoras is a kind of euphemism.  Sensibly looking at its structure and applied technologies, Pythagoreanism should be boldly attributed to totalitarian cults, which was quite in the spirit of the times (however, it is always in the spirit of the times, an eternal classic).  There was a division into degrees of initiation, and a complex system of rituals with prohibitions (for example, well-known, such as ‚Äúnot eating beans‚Äù or ‚Äúnot biting off a whole roll‚Äù), and complex philosophical dogma.  Hello Ron Hubbard associates.  There is nothing new under the sun.

      In general, during the life of Pythagoras, his "school" was a solid enterprise, besides having significant and growing political influence. <br><br>  In general, the philosophy of Pythagoras had a significant impact on Western culture (and for us as well).  Many ideas have been developed in classical Greek philosophy, and already everyone knows about the Pythagorean theorem.  The expression "harmony of the spheres", by the way, also goes back to the Pythagoreans. <br><br>  One of the essential elements of their philosophy was the idea that any number can be represented as the ratio of two integers, that is, in the form of a simple fraction.  In this they, among other things, saw the perfection of the nature of the number.  Moreover, it seemed quite obvious.  In modern mathematics, such numbers are called rational, and their set is denoted by <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c66/4f0/5e2/c664f05e23c7c9092332461bfc3287ac.gif">  .  Now pause for a few seconds, think about where it all comes from, what's wrong?  Can you give an argument that would be convincing enough for an ancient Greek?  Well, or at least convincing enough for yourself, personally? <br><br>  In general, the world of numbers was simple, elegant, and everyone was happy.  The source of the trouble, unexpectedly, was the already mentioned theorem bearing the name of Pythagoras: one of the most important achievements of ours.  Unfortunately, the proof of Pythagoras himself is unknown to us.  The oldest of those that have come down to us is given in the Euclidean Principles and dates back to the 3rd c.  dn  Let me remind you, Pythagoras himself lived in the 6th c.  dn <br><br>  Fragment from Vatican Manuscript Number 190, dated 10th c.  ne  (whole <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/expo/vatican.exhibit/exhibit/d-mathematics/Greek_math.html">here</a> ): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aeb/727/ddd/aeb727ddd83c4740a3f0d1df2e03f8c6.jpg"><br><br>  The proof of Euclid is far from the simplest.  There is reason to believe that he knew the way and simpler, but for methodical reasons he brought this option, which, in addition to the Pythagorean theorem itself, demonstrates some other interesting ideas. <br><br>  However, back to the Pythagoreans. <br><br>  Imagine the simplest thing: a square with sides of unit length.  If we denote the length of its diagonal <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a89/b59/544/a89b59544c2bf004dcd81c65b5eff160.gif">  then by the Pythagorean theorem we get: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a89/b59/544/a89b59544c2bf004dcd81c65b5eff160.gif^2=1^2+1^2"><br>  and correspondingly: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a89/b59/544/a89b59544c2bf004dcd81c65b5eff160.gif=\sqrt{2}"><br>  By itself, this is not a problem.  From the point of view of the Pythagoreans, then you just had to find the integers <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f9/ca1/b1c/4f9ca1b1c8029535c88032fbe0b24b60.gif">  and <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/92c/927/b9f/92c927b9fdd7f1852b55f72b75765a71.gif">  such that <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a15/37c/cb7/a1537ccb7c7aba68849428f79daf34d5.gif"><br>  It was on this ‚Äúsimple‚Äù moment that everything stalled.  And tightly.  This stopper lasted until one clever man (as they say, Hippas from Metapont, also a Pythagorean), proved, suddenly, that there are no such numbers.  All the evil from the very smart goes, as you know.  According to legend, this scientific achievement so shocked colleagues that, to mark the recognition of scientific merit, Hippas was not promptly thrown overboard the ship, on which he sailed at the time of his mathematical insight.  But there was nothing to spoil respected people, to undermine the foundations of such a lovingly fostered and highly profitable philosophical system. <br><br>  Now, the numbers are not representable as the ratio of two integers, called irrational. <br><br>  For some time, the Pythagoreans even kept the fact of irrationality <img height="19" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/797/455/eb8/797455eb82ee1dc6f315e2532bfbb786.gif" width="23">  in secret.  However, you cannot conceal the sewing in a bag, and the truth rather quickly (by historical standards) found its way out. <br><br>  Prove irrationality <img height="19" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/797/455/eb8/797455eb82ee1dc6f315e2532bfbb786.gif" width="23">  not at all difficult. <br>  Let there be such <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f9/ca1/b1c/4f9ca1b1c8029535c88032fbe0b24b60.gif,q">  , what <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a15/37c/cb7/a1537ccb7c7aba68849428f79daf34d5.gif"><br>  Moreover, we assume that at least one of the numbers <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f9/ca1/b1c/4f9ca1b1c8029535c88032fbe0b24b60.gif,q">  - odd.  If this is not the case, the numerator and denominator of the fraction can always be reduced by 2 (the required number of times). <br>  Then we get: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/31e/64b/edc/31e64bedcfc9478b1a32df250c78c59c.gif"><br>  from here: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f9/ca1/b1c/4f9ca1b1c8029535c88032fbe0b24b60.gif^2=2q^2"><br>  In this way, <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f9/ca1/b1c/4f9ca1b1c8029535c88032fbe0b24b60.gif^2">  - even number.

It can be shown that there are more irrational numbers than rational ones, basically more.  By the way, the more-less relationship in the world of infinite sets is itself very controversial.  But that's another story. <br><br>  Ps.  Taking this opportunity, I congratulate the habrovchan on coming.  Good luck in the new year! <br><br>  UPD.  In connection with the discussion that has flared up in the comments, I would like to note the following: to be honest, rational numbers are entered as a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2586%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585">field of partial</a> rings of integers.

The question of which of the school pseudo-definitions is ‚Äútrue‚Äù is decided by the Ministry of Education, and this process has very little to do with mathematics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246963/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246963/</a></p>
