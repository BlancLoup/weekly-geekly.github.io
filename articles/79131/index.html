Let me remind you that not so long ago a similar meeting <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/73876/">was</a> organized, but dedicated to desktop systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5d/af2/f23/d5daf2f237c6c613c479c063b8fece5d.jpg" alt="image">

      This time the place for the meeting was not so shocking, but no less cozy - a small building somewhere in the back streets of Barvikha, where a pleasant New Year's Eve atmosphere was in harmony with three dozen uncles of varying degrees of beardness - these were specialists from THG, IXBT, Ferra, 3DNews , GameLand and other companies. <br><br>  Immediately at the entrance to the hall, under the projector screen, lay engineering samples of various pieces of iron, about which a little later.  As soon as everyone sat down at the tables, a man appeared on the scene, without whom <s>every New Year</s> does not do <s>every</s> Intel meeting - <s>Father Frost</s> <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/75446/">Alexey Rogachkov</a></b> , regional product introduction specialist.  Actually, it was he who began to push the curtains of secrets, but since a lot of information was shrouded in NDA, I will retell it only in general terms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5c7/1eb/eb9/5c71ebeb9960da300c52458e7c4dcd63.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, the Internet is already full of information about the new <b>Intel Atom processors</b> , code-named <b>Pine Trail</b> .  Indeed, next year, Intel plans new stones with a graphics controller and a memory controller integrated into the processor core (for the first time in the X86 family of chips) - these atoms will be intended for entry-level netbooks and desktop PCs (nettops). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c19/85a/127/c1985a12706cade5928458bdcd9b5ea0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The platform for netbooks will be represented by a single-core <b>Intel Atom N450 processor</b> (1.66GHz, 512KB L2 cache) and <b>Intel NM10 Exoress chipset</b> , while nettops will be built on the same chipset, but the processor will be either a single-core <b>Intel Atom D410</b> (1.66GHz, 512KB L2) or Dual-core <b>Intel Atom D510</b> (1.66 GHz, 1024 Kb L2).  These processors are made on 45-nanometer technology and are still the smallest from the manufacturer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a66/d8d/6b7/a66d8d6b7f2ff858b099871884ce9e4a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  What will all this give?  It is logical to assume that reducing the number of chips from three (CPU + north and south bridge) to one (as well as the number of layers for wiring the board) will reduce the size of both the boards and the devices themselves.  With reduced by 20% energy consumption, it was possible to reduce heat dissipation.  In the end, the gain will be in the time of work and the "coolness" of the device, up to passive cooling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fa/b73/5b9/9fab735b90dac3bfbdf8ba8bdb4fd383.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed7/db2/6c8/ed7db26c85ca0a3a487a1c4c3d64e724.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, about heat dissipation - new systems can really do with just one passive cooling, which is another pleasant advantage (along with SSD disks, absolutely silent solutions can be obtained) of upcoming platforms. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a3/019/746/9a3019746d6d0efcd97fe8a12e380804.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e63/dc2/63e/e63dc263e96d83f08d64d91bfee7d1a5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to Alexei Rogachkov, <b>Nikolay Isakov</b> spoke, who told about operating systems that will be installed on new devices.  Together with Windows 7 (Starter or Home Basic), users will be offered an alternative operating system (most likely, Mandriva Linux 2010) with the <b>Moblin</b> platform, which will give an opportunity to fine tune the device interface, as well as install a huge number of packages from the repository.  What surprised me - Microsoft plans to port Silverlight for these devices) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc2/3a0/792/bc23a0792b3f89b5f4fd265e5454bd17.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90c/9b2/4fe/90c9b24fe9ded1cc90c67f40e1846b7b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/606/2c5/fba/6062c5fba390581c9ca5024589e4f028.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  He also spoke about the development of the new <b>Intel Atom Developer</b> program and about the launch of an authorized Intel online store with a new economic model, which will primarily be of interest to independent developers of components and software. <br>  Ischo - within the <b>Intel Software Network</b> , the <b><a href="http://software.intel.com/ru-ru/articles/blackbelt/">Black Belt</a></b> program is working with might and main, which may allow someone to join the slender ranks of the company's employees.  In short - a kind of ‚ÄúRPG‚Äù for developers and programmers), skills in which swing by contributing to the development of the community. <br><br><h2>  About mussels) </h2><br>  In addition to the upcoming netbooks (ASUS EeePC 1005PE and unknown models from MSI and Samsung), two interesting devices were presented at the meeting - one from the <b>MID</b> class (Mobile Internet Device), the second from the <b>MIND</b> class ( <s>Moscow</s> Mobile Internet Navigation Device).  Although both classes are not new - the devices from them have already been represented by different companies, it was nice to see how it will look in the near future) Engineering samples, both on Linux.  There is almost everything that is in current devices (in terms of software), but the hardware was pleasantly surprised) If it works, I will make reviews of these pieces of iron, but for now just a couple of shots: <br><br>  <b>MIND</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/672/173/26f/67217326f4b574b16de9e754d0fd86eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6c/247/c65/b6c247c65d7bc3bf5718bdee4a69cac7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d34/0b3/2ae/d340b32ae6ea15ab599df26ce6ee59e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/924/70c/569/92470c56905280d3e11da6e201a4af6c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/951/3e9/cdd/9513e9cdd57e73137fa3f8a17dbd8675.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/911/863/034/911863034876a348d7f4e82805fc71ea.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>MID</b> : <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b4e/245/f91/b4e245f9126bf5a2269700cd004e130f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f5/86a/d3a/1f586ad3a1bcac7241eb5c12c1f0cfd1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/849/411/325/849411325a03f24cf2d6069ff85f23d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f1/b90/df0/2f1b90df009c6a70bb1e2101597df654.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With its Intel processors, in fact, has generated a new segment of devices on the market, sales of which have surpassed sales of iPhones, nintent and Vii.  Therefore, the development of this direction is logical) Agree - in a period of economic crisis, the development of such devices can not but rejoice - someone has enough functionality of a full-fledged computer or laptop is not needed, but someone just does not like the cost.  Well, in general, the downsizing trend is also very pleasant;) By the way, at the moment with new Atoms, about 80 design options have been developed, including products from companies such as ASUS, Acer, Dell, Fujitsu, Lenovo, MSI, Toshiba, Samsung and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/471/aa7/607/471aa7607f8e5ad8dcd6b593d86df399.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Having drank and eaten, having looked at beautiful slides, having communicated with each other, everyone left for their business :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c6/a72/36e/3c6a7236eb992dc93a45e1f5c58bdb80.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way!  I remembered an interesting question for Alexei Rogachkov, who sounded from the audience: ‚Äú <i>Tell me, the thermal pack of current netbooks is about 12W, although laptops released at the beginning of the millennium on the Intel Centrino platform had about the same situation.</i>  <i>Both systems cope with high-quality video only with gritting teeth.</i>  <i>in fact, the problems to be solved are very similar.</i>  <i>So where is the progress?</i>  ".  It would be interesting to know the answer to this question from readers;) <br><br><img src="http://trendclub.ru//i/favicon.ico" alt="image">  All news regarding ASUS and Intel first appear on the <b><a href="http://trendclub.ru/">TrendClub</a></b> project - welcome! <br><br>  I will try to keep up to date;) <br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79131/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79131/</a></p>
