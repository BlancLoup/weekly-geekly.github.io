The author of your torment - <a href="https://habr.com/users/damnerd/" class="user_link">damnerd</a> .  We tell what he came up with, and how you had to solve the tasks. </p><br><h2 id="vhod-v-kvest">  Log in to the quest </h2><br><p>  By tradition, they hid it in the <a href="https://youtu.be/7QNSFxT7bfk">video</a> .  Even at normal browsing speed, one could see a cipher, in time with the music, a video slips on one of the scenes: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/li/wq/ft/liwqftanb1a9cfim22yhpppqloe.png"><br><br><p>  Although some have rushed to write decorative letters from another scene: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ft/ny/-_/ftny-_4efwhrhnmwjqecnehnzjc.png"><br><br><p>  Rewrite the cipher and get: aHR0 cHM6 Ly9t Ymx0 ZGV2 LnJ1 L3J1 L3F1 aXo = </p><br><p> Having seen the <code>=</code> sign at the end, we immediately understand that this is a string encoded in base64 format.  Without thinking, we perform </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs pgsql">echo <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'aHR0 cHM6 Ly9t Ymx0 ZGV2 LnJ1 L3J1 L3F1 aXo='</span></span> | base64 <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">--decode</span></span></code> </pre> <br><p>  (or google base64 decode online) and get a link to the quest entry: <a href="https://mbltdev.ru/ru/quiz">https://mbltdev.ru/ru/quiz</a> </p><br><p>  In principle, the URL remained the same as last time, because programmers were lazy and did not change it.  It is rumored that there were those who "guessed" the link from memory, or showed his skill of extrasensory perception. </p><br><h2 id="zadanie-1">  Exercise 1 </h2><br><p>  It was necessary to follow the link and write the name of the team we left in the tooltip.  During the transition, we showed a picture: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/66/w2/np/66w2npr5r2xjjzxbvy8qn7nuuhy.png"><br><p>  Everything is pretty simple: Source = source code.  We look that in it: </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pc/u-/3s/pcu-3sax4o3paf13780mpqa9z2a.png"></div><br><p>  Here we did not confuse the person with any obfuscated code or something similar, but instead, in the most visible place, in the most obvious way (the words of the cow) gave a hint.  As it turned out, our attempt to attract attention turned around for some people to the contrary a distraction from the clue.  Many, in response to the question, introduced the <code>cowsay</code> command, which generates similar ASCII graphics.  However, it was necessary to look at the text: It's in the name.  Dig it ?!  The command name was directly at the prompt itself: <strong>dig</strong> .  Actually, we asked the team name (because the team itself can be executed with the same success with a different set of parameters, and the programmers are lazy and the answer checking system is stupid), so this was the answer to the first question. </p><br><h2 id="zadanie-2">  Task 2 </h2><br><p>  After executing the ‚Äúdig‚Äù command, you had to see a hint with which you can proceed to the next step.  We asked to write its value. </p><br><p>  Returning to the clue from the past task, in addition to the word dig, the word name was next to it, carrying the meaning of the domain name.  Neighborhood standing name and dig suggest the next step: the need to scratch (or pokorit, if you will) domain records for the name, where the page with the hint lies.  Of course, by default dig asks for an A-record, in which there is nothing but the main record with the IP address.  It was necessary to guess that you need to request a TXT record: </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs pgsql">&gt; dig +nocmd +noall +answer q1.mbltdev.ru txt q1.mbltdev.ru. <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">10108</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">IN</span></span> TXT "quest@95.163.108.79:10022"</code> </pre> <br><p>  Or google dig online and use a simple web-muzzle without reading the mana on digu: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ef/oz/8i/efoz8ilbvhv2hjnwaoeti_6foec.png">

    <p>  The meaning of this text entry was the answer to the task, as well as a hint to the next action ‚Äî log in via SSH to host <code>95.163.108.79</code> under user <code>quest</code> on port <code>10022</code> : ssh quest@95.163.108.79 -p 10022. </p><br><h2 id="zadanie-3">  Task 3 </h2><br><p>  We made a rebus about what is common between Android and iOS.  Asked to calculate the password and enter it. </p><br><p>  Many wrote that it was too difficult.  But this is a rebus in a quest that no one can pass!  But in general, everything was in the text, even the word Parent. </p><br><p>  Intersection of android and apple ‚Üí os <br>  The progenitor of their OS ‚Üí Unix <br>  lowercase (unix) ‚Üí unix <br>  sha1 (unix) ‚Üí <strong>d13bbbd92b83ddaad994a12bd9d20dfba5fff139</strong> </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs bash">&gt; <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span></span> -n <span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"unix"</span></span> | shasum d13bbbd92b83ddaad994a12bd9d20dfba5fff139 -</code> </pre> <br><p>  As usual, it was possible to google sha1 online and calculate the amount without departing from the cash register. </p><br><h2 id="zadanie-4">  Task 4 </h2><br><p>  All that was needed to complete this task was in the home directory.  We asked to get the next hint after entering the password from Task 3 and write its value. </p><br><p>  At this stage, many wanted to give up and wrote us angry comments, but in reality everything was very simple. </p><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7c1/097/a50/7c1097a5033063e01cc0534797f3a481.gif"></div><br><p>  There are only 4 files in the home directory, two of which are not in the works - <code>.profile</code> and <code>.bashrc</code> were almost completely defaulted to the new user.  There were two files with an ‚Äúempty‚Äù name.  By the way, even SSH MOTD hinted at it with his phrase <code>/\s/</code> .  This is not a strange smiley, but a regular expression for the whitespace.  In the name of the first file there was an ordinary space character (U + 0020: SPACE).  The second is an unusual space from Chinese writing (U + 3000 IDEOGRAPHIC SPACE). </p><br><p>  ITerm2 users on Mac OS had an additional difficulty: this emulator did not want to copy an unusual space.  The usual Terminal easily copied the symbol, and you could simply execute commands on it with a simple ‚åòC-‚åòV.  But for users of curves emulators, as well as lovers of perversions, there were other methods, for example, to make <code>ls -li</code> , to find out the inode number of the file, and continue to execute commands using <code>find</code> : </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs matlab"><span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">find</span></span> . -inum <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">660402</span></span> | xargs <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">cat</span></span></code> </pre> <br><p>  By the way, this command simply spits out many empty lines in the terminal.  Here, knowledgeable people could immediately guess that this is a listing of the program in the Whitespace language, google whitespace interpreter online and get the following hint.  Ignorant people could just guess that we need to somehow combine the two files that they have at their disposal.  An additional hint was that one of these files has a flag for execution (+ x) and pearl barley.  Anyway, the execution of the program gave the answer: <strong><a href="">http://q1.mbltdev.ru/q.webp</a></strong> </p><br><h2 id="zadanie-5">  Task 5 </h2><br><p>  In the fourth task, we hid the link <a href="">http://q1.mbltdev.ru/q.webp</a> .  In the fifth it was necessary to go through it and answer the question. </p><br><p>  The final task was simple to defuse the situation.  At this URL, there was a <code>tiff</code> image saved with <code>webp</code> resolution.  Some smart graphic viewers opened it without question.  Some did not open.  But it was enough to ask someone who knows: </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs haskell">&gt; file q.webp q.webp: <span class="hljs-type"><span class="hljs-type">TIFF</span></span> image <span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">data</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class"> &gt; mv q.{</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">webp</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class">,</span><span class="hljs-title"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-title">tiff</span></span></span><span class="hljs-class">}</span></span></code> </pre> <br><p>  In the picture itself there was a simple question: </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z8/2f/lw/z82flwvpzfhuuorkoa5kq5msjs4.png"><br><br><p>  Answer: 0. <a href="https://mbltdev.ru/ru%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dquiz_results">MBLT DEV</a> always takes place in Moscow.  This year we meet on September 28. </p><br><p>  By the way, they say, some found a picture of a detour.  This was possible if I fumbled around the server from the 4th task, because the page from the first task, and the picture from the last, and tasks 3 and 4 were hosted on the same machine (do not forget about the laziness of the developers).  In short: </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs ruby">quest@questmblt2018<span class="hljs-symbol"><span class="hljs-symbol">:~</span></span>$ grep root /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/quest root /var/www/html; quest@questmblt2018<span class="hljs-symbol"><span class="hljs-symbol">:~</span></span>$ ls /var/www/html/ index.html index.nginx-debian.html q.webp</code> </pre> <br><h2 id="post-mortem">  Post mortem </h2><br><p>  By the way, about the laziness of developers: although we knew that it would not be without a coochacker in such a quest, we were too lazy to protect ourselves from all possible problems.  For example, people began to correspond with broadcast messages, making it difficult for others to complete the quest. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wg/yw/z9/wgywz9i6w127tqqzgs3ccqo_sxk.png"><br><br><p>  There was some craftsman who uploaded 15 GB of data to the server, having exhausted the disk space.  Of course, there were also script-kiddisy, launching fork-bombs, breaking login for other users.  Well, it was not without the "spam" bots, who tried, knowing the correct answers, to stake out more chances for themselves in the final lottery. </p><br><p>  We apologize to those who were prevented by unscrupulous participants. </p><br><h2 id="podarki-i-pobediteli">  Gifts and winners </h2><br><p>  3070 people tried to complete the quest.  We received 666 answers, cleaned the cheaters, as a result, 297 people successfully coped with the quest.  Among them, we played the main gifts. </p><br><p>  Each participant was assigned a sequence number and with the help of <a href="https://www.random.org/">a random number generator they</a> won prizes.  Recorded a video with a selection of winners.
