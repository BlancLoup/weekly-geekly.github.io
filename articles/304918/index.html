      <b>Cheat codes for winning 4 bosses, which you may find in the quest for a new software developer</b> <br><br>  In most cases, the long journey of getting a software developer post is tortuous and full of difficulties. <br><br>  Of course, if you are a very talented and creative person, you can be received faster than usual.  The process can be accelerated in the case when the company urgently needs an employee. <br><br>  But, as a rule, software developers end up in a grand confusing quest of passing through several levels in order to get the job of their dreams. <br><br>  Wait a minute, what a super quest?  What are the levels?  It looks like a computer game, is not it? <br><br>  Let's get to the bottom of our idea.  If you think about it well, the managers involved in the technical interview process are similar to the ‚Äúbosses‚Äù that players meet in the finals of each level of computer game. <br><br>  The main player (for example, Mario, Zelda, or Duke Nyukem) needs to defeat all the bosses in the game to go to the next level: just like managers in IT companies. <br><br>  The hero needs to learn how to build strategies depending on the characteristics of different bosses to win the game, because each of them has different characteristics (although there are common tactics). <br>  Therefore, let's treat the interview for the position of a software developer with humor and take the whole process as an exciting game in which you go to the final and defeat the managers who accept you to work, which will be: <br><ul><li>  recruitment specialist; </li><li>  senior developer; </li><li>  software manager; </li><li>  CTO. </li></ul><br>  Ready?  Fine!  We start with a bout with a recruiter from the personnel department on the first level. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00D05A">Level 1: Boss, Recruitment Specialist</font> </h2><br>  The human resources boss has the following characteristics: <br><ul><li>  guards access to other bosses; </li><li>  the first to read and evaluate your resume; </li><li>  usually not technically prepared; </li><li>  Interested to get you a few jobs in the company. </li></ul><br>  <b>Posted by</b> Jennifer Loffus, Astron Solutions Regional Director, Former President of the New York Human Resource Professionals Association. <br><br>  Everyone who has already been interviewed for the position of a software developer knows that, most likely, they first need to meet with a staff member.  He or she usually has many questions for you, and they also hold the key to the following levels where you will meet with the managers of information technology departments.  How to get through this first level, where your resume is considered, a phone call and a personal conversation with the boss from the personnel department is held? <br><br>  There is an opinion that personnel officers have only one desire - to fill up candidates for a new position.  Remember Toby from The Office?  So, his image of the personnel department specialist is greatly embellished. <br><br>  Your recruitment team may have spoiled your career plans.  However, their main goal is not to not accept you.  They are faced with a specific task from the management to find the best candidate for the vacancy, so they look at the following characteristics of the applicant: education, professional experience and qualifications in the required field.  Let's explore the strategy of building perfect relationships with human resources. <br><br>  To get to the first level of an interview with a staff member, avoid the following mistakes: <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Do not send a resume with errors</font> </h3><br>  Your resume tells about you, about your attitude to detail and interest in the vacancy.  A resume with errors will tell HR officers that you care about both the company and the position itself.  Carefully check the summary for errors several times, read it out loud to notice typos.  Ask someone else to read it again, because, perhaps, he will find errors that you have not noticed. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Do not send too long resume</font> </h3><br>  You have achieved a lot in your career and you want to tell about it.  A personnel officer wants to understand whether you are suitable for a specific position, while he has very little time to get acquainted with your resume.  Edit your resume so that it suits exactly the vacancy you are applying for.  The summary should contain 500 - 1000 words and be a maximum of two pages.  Use 12 fonts to make the text easy to read (rather than 8 or 9). <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Do not send general resumes and motivational letters</font> </h3><br>  Your resume and motivation letter must be adapted to the specific position, company and business.  For example, if you are applying for an Internet developer position in a financial company, and in a resume and letter you are talking about your interest in managing information technology in a non-profit organization, you are unlikely to be invited for an interview.  Describe <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/kakie-professionalnye-navyki-stanut-znachimymi-v-blizhayshie-gody/">meaningful skills</a> ! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#00D05A">You have been invited for an interview with a staff member!</font> </h2><br>  Congratulations!  You have already received an invitation to the first interview with the personnel officer.  We have prepared several cheat codes to help you get past it and meet with a senior developer at level 2. <br><br>  <b>Cheat code:</b> if you send too long, unadapted for a specific job summary, or there are errors in it, your game will end without even starting. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Come in advance and well prepared</font> </h3><br>  When you arrive at the company's office, you may need to fill out some papers.  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uchebnik-produktivnosti-ot-lezheboki/">Plan your time</a> so that they fill before the start of the interview.  Usually, managers have a tight schedule of interviews, so waiting for a candidate for 20 minutes is unacceptable for them.  In addition, bring contacts of those who agreed to give you recommendations. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Dress in official style</font> </h3><br>  For men, a business suit with a tie is obligatory, for women, a pantsuit or jacket with a skirt.  If you are applying for a creative position in a young firm, the classic style may not be suitable.  Specify the dress code of the personnel officer. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Tidy yourself up</font> </h3><br>  Unpleasant odors should not distract your interlocutor.  Make sure that you do not smell of onions, garlic, tobacco or coffee before the meeting.  Stock up on chewing gum or mouth spray. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Focus!</font> </h3><br>  Spend all your attention and personnel department at the interview, be courteous to him, turn off the mobile phone so as not to interfere. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Almost level 2!</font> </h3><br>  Check that you are properly dressed, smell good and are fully tuned in for an interview.  And here you are at the finish line of level 1!  Besides the fact that you have all the skills and experience you need for this position, you need ... <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Maintain eye contact</font> </h3><br>  If you look at your interlocutor, you will show a genuine interest in the work and the company.  Look at it, and not at your hands, ceiling, door or window, so you will significantly increase the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-prostykh-deystviy-dlya-povysheniya-effektivnosti-obshcheniya/">effectiveness of communication</a> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Go on the offensive</font> </h3><br>  Many have a break in professional experience, especially in times of crisis.  Be the first to explain the reasons for the breaks in your career and don‚Äôt wait for questions on this topic.  An open and active position will give you an edge over those who try to hide such facts. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Get ready to talk about past employers.</font> </h3><br>  Most likely, you will be asked why you left your previous job, as well as what you liked and didn‚Äôt like to do in the previous position.  Prepare reliable and tactful answers.  Remember that negative information about the past leader or colleagues will not play into your hands. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Speak in clear words</font> </h3><br>  Software developers use many abbreviations: ASP, CAO, GAC, IIS, etc.  During a conversation with a personnel officer (possibly without technical education), decipher each abbreviation when you call it the first time.  Make sure that you speak the language understandable to the interlocutor, so as not to provoke new questions. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Ask questions</font> </h3><br>  Study in advance the information about the company and prepare at least 3 questions to the personnel department employee.  Here are some win-win questions you can ask during your interview: <br><ul><li>  What do you like most about the organization? </li><li>  Why do you work here?  People love to talk about themselves! </li><li>  How does information technology support the company's development plans? </li><li>  What mistakes do new employees usually make? </li></ul><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Say "thanks"</font> </h3><br>  If the interview went well, a recruiter spent with you from 30 to 60 minutes.  On the same day, send one traditional letter and one email with thanks for taking the time. <br><br>  This proven technique will set you apart from the crowd, and the other person will remember you for sure.  In the letter, specify a couple of topics about which the personnel officer spoke, so that it turns out to be personal. <br><br>  So, you have been interviewed by a recruiter and the quest continues. In the next article, meet the boss at level 2: the senior developer. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/pomeshatelstvo-na-pochve-sobesedovaniy/">Insanity based on interviews?</a>  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/pomeshatelstvo-na-pochve-sobesedovaniy/">How to restore self-confidence, moving up the career ladder</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304918/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304918/</a></p>
