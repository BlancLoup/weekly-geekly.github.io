  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Belarusian rubles will appear in the WebMoney system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  WebMoney Transfer finally found a bank in Belarus, which agreed to become the guarantor of the new e-currency with the abbreviation WMB.  The money will go to circulation very soon, but will be quite expensive. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúCurrently there are final technological and financial preparations.  The official launch of WMB wallets will be widely announced, ‚Äùsaid Peter Darakhvelidze, director of external relations for WebMoney Transfer, told Habrahabru.  However, the introduction of WMB means of payment and the legalization of the WebMobney system in the territory of the Republic of Belarus seems to be a settled matter.  The Belarusian Tekhnobank has already published a <a href="http://tb.by/blank/tariffs/%25D2%25E0%25F0%25E8%25F4%25FB%2520%25CE%25C0%25CE%2520%25D2%25E5%25F5%25ED%25EE%25E1%25E0%25ED%25EA%2520%25EF%25EE%2520%25F1%25EE%25F1%25F2%25EE%25FF%25ED%25E8%25FE%2520%25ED%25E0%252001.07.2006.xls">protocol with tariffs for its services</a> (XLS file), in which there are services provided by WebMoney Transfer.  In addition, the official site <a href="http://www.wmtransfer.by/">WMTransfer.By</a> has already opened. <br><br>  Judging by the published tariffs, ‚ÄúBelarusian webmoney‚Äù will be a very expensive pleasure.  For the purchase and sale of WMB bank is going to charge 3% of the amount.  This is a very big percentage, which can be explained only by one factor: monopoly.  It will be possible to purchase WMB only in ‚ÄúTechnobank‚Äù, and the use of other WMZ, WME or WMR units of account from WebMoney Transfer in Belarus is still not regulated by law. <br><br>  Until now, the entire WebMoney Transfer system was located in Belarus, in fact, beyond the law.  Virtually none of the online stores did not accept these funds for payment, and the owners of exchange offices were repeatedly prosecuted.  Another victim of the financial control authorities recently became the exchange office <a href="http://forum.wmbelarus.com/index.php">WMBelarus</a> , of which only the forum now remains.

      With the advent of WMB, the situation with illegal exchangers will not improve.  Rather, the opposite is true - it may worsen, since the exchangers will become ‚Äúcompetitors‚Äù of the only official partner of WebMoney Transfer in Belarus - Tehnobank.  It is beneficial for him to have only WMB in circulation in the country, for the exchange of which he will take his three percent.  In addition, according to the tariffs of the bank, to obtain the initial certificate, the user will have to pay the bank $ 2.  It is possible that obtaining an initial certificate will be a prerequisite for opening a WMB wallet. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBelarusian WebMoney‚Äù will become the second legal electronic payment system in Belarus after the <a href="http://easypay.by/">Easypay</a> system.  ‚ÄúBelarus has a Resolution of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus of November 26, 2003, No. 201, which regulates the issue and circulation of electronic money.  WebMoney together with ‚ÄúTechnobank‚Äù ‚Äúare preparing to issue the Belarusian WM-currency, which will be regulated by this decree,‚Äù says Peter Darakhvelidze. <br><br>  It is interesting that the decree ‚ÄúOn approval of the rules for conducting operations with electronic money‚Äù ( <a href="http://www.nbrb.by/publications/payment/documents/rulesofoperationswithemoney.rtf">RTF</a> ) mentioned by Peter Darakhvelidze contains a number of very interesting provisions that significantly complicate the life of Belarusian Easypay users and obviously complicate the lives of WMB users.  For example, one of the provisions limits the maximum amount of payment to the equivalent of 200 euros. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4207/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4207/</a></p>
