  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interface Digest, June 2013</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For three years now I have been publishing regular reviews of fresh articles on the topic of interfaces, new tools and collections of patterns, interesting cases and historical stories.  From the tapes of several hundred thematic subscriptions, approximately 5% of the worthwhile publications are selected that are interesting to share.  Previous materials: <a href="http://www.jvetrau.com/category/digest/">April 2010-May 2013</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/751/e36/579/751e3657992860f8a101b8b991c2373b.png" alt="Review of fresh materials, June 2013" width="550" height="150"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Patterns and Best Practices </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://boxesandarrows.com/icon-survey-results/">In Defense of Floppy Disks - The Vocabulary of the Interface</a></strong> <br>  The save icon in the form of a floppy is scolded by all and sundry.  But a little research by Lis Pardi shows that it works well even for a young audience that has not encountered a physical prototype. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/29/the-state-of-responsive-web-design/">The State Of Responsive Web Design</a></strong> <br>  A super-useful overview of the current state of technology adaptive design from St√©phanie Walter.  She talks about the mechanisms for displaying images and other media content, page layout, working with navigation and input methods, design tables.

      <strong><a href="http://interactions.acm.org/blog/view/color-and-user-experience">Color and user experience</a></strong> <br>  Ashley Karr briefly describes the nuances of using color in interfaces.  She also cites the meaning of specific colors in American culture. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/06/three-reasons-weve-outgrown-mobile-context.php">Three Reasons We've Outgrown Mobile Context</a></strong> <br>  SuAnne Hall brings together the ideas of Luke Wroblewski and Karen McGrane and writes that the concept of ‚Äúmobile use context‚Äù is outdated and cannot be based on it.  The article contains a lot of useful statistics and examples of why there should be no division into ‚Äúmobile‚Äù and ‚Äúmain‚Äù content and functionality. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://everypageispageone.com/2013/05/28/findability-is-a-content-problem-not-a-search-problem/">Findability is a Content Problem, not a Search Problem</a></strong> <br>  Mark Baker writes that problems when users search for the necessary information primarily concern the organization of content, and not the work of search tools.  He reviews the basic concepts and theories in this area and supports the findings with statistics. <br><br><h2>  Understanding the user </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://journalofia.org/volume4/issue2/02-fisher/">Cross-channel design sense making</a></strong> <br>  Jon Fisher, Simon Norris and Elizabeth Buie published a detailed theoretical study of the problem of user interaction with the product through several channels.  They offer an interesting channel classification and conduct a small experiment to confirm their hypotheses. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.fastcodesign.com/1672657/google-s-dead-simple-tool-for-making-ux-decisions-2-jars-of-marbles">Google's Dead-Simple For UX Decisions - 2 Jars Of Marbles</a></strong> <br>  Fast Co.Design talks about a simple and very intuitive interface design method used by the Android design team at Google.  To neutralize any negative point in the interface, you need to give the user three positive things, so the designers try to maintain this balance. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/content-sharing-and-social-networking-buttons">Content Sharing and Social Networking Buttons</a></strong> <br>  A small study of how and in what cases users share links with friends.  For some situations, the standard buttons of social networks are in demand, in other cases people send them by mail. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/articles/usability-for-senior-citizens/">Usability for Senior Citizens</a></strong> <br>  Overview of problems in the interaction of older people with modern sites and applications from Jacob Nielsen. <br><br><h2>  Designing the structure and interface screens </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.apple.com/ios/ios7/">iOS 7</a></strong> <br>  On June 10, iOS7 was introduced, which radically changed the look of the platform and reinforced the importance of interface animation.  Those who invested in metro- / flat-design did not lose, although some adaptation would still be required.  Useful materials: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios//design/index.html">Guidelines for translating apps to iOS7</a> .  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/evgenybelyaev16/transition-guide">Version in public access</a> . </li><li>  Human Interface Guidelines.  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/evgenybelyaev16/mobile-hig-22784587">Version in public access</a> . </li><li>  UIKit User Interface Catalog.  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/evgenybelyaev16/ui-kit-uicatalog">Version in public access</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/tools/ios7/">Teehan UI Kit + Lax</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://stenzils.com/">UI Kit for OmniGraffle</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://www.pixeden.com/media-icons/tab-bar-icons-ios-7">Icons for use in applications</a> . </li></ul><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/designing-down-from-science-fiction-a-staged-approach">Designing Down from Science Fiction - A Staged Approach</a></strong> <br>  Dan Turner describes in detail the interface design method through sci-fi film concepts described in Nathan Schedroff and Chris Noessel's ‚ÄúMake It So‚Äù.  This is a great way to "sell" complex ideas and unusual concepts, as well as a good variation on the theme of design thinking. <br><br>  <strong><a href="https://www.jetstrap.com/">Jetstrap - The Twitter Bootstrap Builder Tool</a></strong> <br>  The Jetstrap online constructor allows you to build interface prototypes based on the Bootstrap framework on the fly.  Free work with only one project. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/hosting-a-page-description-workshop">Hosting a Page Description Workshop</a></strong> <br>  Page Description Diagrams is a forgotten tool for designing specific interface screens, which turned out to be too abstract as a project artifact.  But this is a great tool for collecting requirements and Colin Butler with Andrew Wirtanen describe the format of the working session to build them. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/06/tools-for-mobile-ux-design.php">Tools for Mobile UX Design</a></strong> <br>  Steven Hoober describes his mobile application design tools.  These are programs, office, examples of specifications and other artifacts.  And Lennart Hennings writes <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/24/sketching-for-better-mobile-experiences/">about mobile interface sketches</a> . <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/17/five-ways-prevent-bad-microcopy/">Five Ways To Prevent Bad Microcopy</a></strong> <br>  Bill Beard writes about how to prepare good micro-texts in interfaces - signatures to forms, error messages, etc. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uifaces.com/">User Inter Faces - Sample avatars for interface design</a></strong> <br>  User Inter Faces will help with avatars for prototypes and design layouts.  It generates a user matrix with custom sizes. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://jaunesarmiento.me/fries/">Fries - Create sexy Android like UI using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</a></strong> <br>  The Fries framework allows you to build Android applications in HTML.  This is a fast prototyping method based on the default OS design. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://taybenlor.com/2013/05/21/designing-for-ios.html">Starters Guide to iOS Design</a></strong> <br>  A useful reminder for beginners in designing and designing applications for the iPhone and iPad from Ben Taylor. <br><br><h2>  User research and testing </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3007979/open-company/secrets-facebooks-mobile-ux-testing-team">Secrets From Facebook's Mobile UX Testing Team</a></strong> <br>  Nate Bolt, head of the Facebook research team, talks about how user research is taking place at the company.  They rely on remote research - it allows you to catch the user at the right time in their natural environment.  In addition, the story of <a href="http://www.fastcolabs.com/3008397/open-company/how-facebook-did-ux-testing-facebook-home-fewer-60-people">how to test Facebook Home</a> . <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2013/06/using-paired-interviews-to-understand-the-current-and-future-perspectives-of-teenagers.php">Using Paired Interviews for Teenagers</a></strong> <br>  Catalina Naranjo-Bock describes a user research method using pair interviews.  She talks about her study of adolescents and how this approach worked in practice. <br><br><h2>  Metrics and ROI </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://issuu.com/anttipitkanen/docs/droi_measurabledesign_2012_issuu_en/1">Design ROI - Measurable Design</a></strong> <br>  The finest research project of Aalto, a Finnish university student, on ROI design and design.  It begins with a detailed study of the current state of the industry and offers specific assessment methods.  Also recently came the <a href="http://www.watermarkconsult.net/blog/2013/04/02/the-watermark-consulting-2013-customer-experience-roi-study/">Watermark Consluting study</a> , which shows that the largest companies were more successful in the market, subject to serious investments in customer experience. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.measuringusability.com/blog/ux-changes-nps.php">Associating UX Changes to the Net Promoter Score</a></strong> <br>  Jeff Sauro describes in detail how to start counting and analyzing the Net Promoter Score metrics for the company's products.  Extremely useful step by step instructions. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.measuringusability.com/blog/visual-appeal.php">Measuring The Visual Appeal Of Websites</a></strong> <br>  Jeff Sauro describes methods for evaluating the aesthetic appeal of a product interface.  This is especially interesting in the light of the overall minimization of visual design. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.measuringusability.com/blog/10-things-SUS.php">10 Things to Know About System Usability Scale (SUS)</a></strong> <br>  Jeff Sauro describes the features of using the SUS (System Usability Scale) metric. <br><br><h2>  Management of interface projects and processes </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://designinteams.com/">Design in teams</a></strong> <br>  Guido Stompff's most interesting blog about modern product teams, in which the complex process of collectively creating and developing ideas gives a far greater result than the work of the mythical lone genius praised by the people.  The author prepared for the protection of scientific work and publishes materials from the research to it. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uie.com/articles/requirements_gathering/">Replacing "Requirements Gathering" with Something That Works</a></strong> <br>  The excellent Jared Spool article on why the step of gathering requirements from the classic diagrams of the interface design process is a myth and self-deception.  He relies on the fact that the customer knows exactly and comprehensively the requirements for the product and they do not change during the course of the project, which is usually not the case.  And Scott Sehlhorst tells you <a href="http://tynerblain.com/blog/2013/06/25/cargo-cult-requirements/">how to get</a> rid <a href="http://tynerblain.com/blog/2013/06/25/cargo-cult-requirements/">of cargo cult in describing requirements</a> . <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.cmsmagazine.ru/library/items/usability/management-long-project/">Management of long UX projects</a></strong> <br>  Review of problem situations in projects for the design of interfaces, fair for a service company from Ilya Belnik.  However, for a grocery company the situation is very different - this is stated in the previous link. <br><br><h2>  Methodologies, procedures, standards </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://bridging-the-gap.me/2013/06/10/softer-side-of-change/">Softer side of change</a></strong> <br>  Mike Clark proposes to combine the theory of business process reengineering and design thinking in order to propose not only interesting ideas, but also concrete plans for changes in companies. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://designinteams.com/2013/06/15/the-unbearable-lightness-of-design-thinking/">The unbearable lightness of Design Thinking</a></strong> <br>  Guido Stompf reflects on why design thinking is so much praised by designers and often causes ridicule from top management.  He describes four ways of finding product ideas and solutions that are required by different members of the project team and how they differ in details and outlook. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2013/06/21/13-tenets-user-experience/">Thirteen Tenets Of User Experience</a></strong> <br>  Robert Hoekman Jr offers his 13 principles / commandments of a good UX.  Moreover, these are not specific heuristics and patterns, but rather general professional installations. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.henkwijnholds.com/design-principles-choose-ideas/">Design principles to choose the right ideas</a></strong> <br>  Henk Wijnholds shows how you can use the company's design principles in practice.  They allow you to check how new features and their interface implementation are in line with the spirit of the product strategy. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://uxmag.com/articles/book-excerpt-design-for-care">Book Excerpt: Design For Care</a></strong> <br>  An excerpt from Peter H. Jones's Design for Care: Innovating Healthcare Experience, which was recently released by Rosenfeld Media.  <a href="http://rosenfeldmedia.com/books/design-for-care/">Information about the book</a> . <br><br><h2>  Cases </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Google-Visual-Assets-Guidelines-Part-1/9028077">Google Visual Assets Guidelines</a></strong> <br>  The Google design team has laid out on Behance a prototype of a guideline on the use of design styles and the design of the company's interfaces.  <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Google-Visual-Assets-Guidelines-Part-2/9084309">The second part</a> . <br><br><h2>  Story </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://firehead.net/2013/06/a-brief-history-of-content-strategy/">A brief history of content strategy</a></strong> <br>  The history of the discipline of content strategy, the interest in which has been actively growing in recent years.  For the first time they started talking about it in 1997-1998, and in 2009 there was an explosion of interest. <br><br><h2>  Trends </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp%3F1742">Jason Grigsby - The Immobile Web @ An Event Apart</a></strong> <br>  Notes on the presentation of Jason Grigsby, dedicated to modern television interfaces.
