The concept of this appeared on the Internet relatively recently, by definition, it unites people who, with "special trepidation", refer to everything that Sony makes.  ‚ÄúSoniboy‚Äù is a nickname more negative than positive, because fanaticism itself implies excessive love, and excessive fanaticism automatically goes beyond all understanding.  But, you see, we are all ‚Äúsonboi‚Äù in a mild form.  After all, Sony is not just an engine, it is a whole locomotive that drags a freight train full of new technologies and fresh solutions.  So let's forget the "internecine wars" on the Internet and at the time of the Sony press conference at E3 we put on our fans' masks. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let's start with the most important.  As expected, Sony gave up on the E3 and finally announced the release date of Gran Turismo on November 5 - 2, though only for North America.  We hope that in Europe the appearance of a super-gaming game will not drag on.  Recall that the GT5 will be completely different from previous games in the series.  For the first time will appear online multiplayer mode, designed for 16 users.  One of the main innovations will be a car damage system.  In addition, the developers promise us dynamic weather, which will directly affect the behavior of the car, racing at different times of the day, as well as arrivals in the framework of the WRC, NASCAR and Super GT tournaments.

      The presentation video for Gran Turismo 5 is not as spectacular as, say, the new <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/games/96466/">NFS: Hot Pursuit</a> .  But firstly, you should not compare the simulator with the arcade, and secondly, the GT5 movie is made on the game engine, and not prepared at the graphic stations.  Watch the video is a must - the developers did not stint and quite clearly showed the behavior of the car on the new tracks, and even the legendary Stig from the Top Gear program: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/nd0fscJeyxg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh6n9ezwpGKW8VS5p8eUAnC6_2LGA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Gran Turismo 5. Official video from E3 2010 [HD]</b> <br><br>  If the news related to Gran Turismo 5 was quite expected, the announcement of the PS3 version of Portal 2 was a real surprise.  Speech by Valve Software‚Äôs executive director Gabe Newell at Sony‚Äôs press conference was somewhat shocking - after all, just a few weeks ago, he <a href="http://games.qip.ru/news/online/1032/">sharply criticized the</a> PlayStation, and now, according to him, Valve Software considers PlayStation 3 to be the best platform for their new Games: ‚ÄúWhen the console first hit the market, I was its biggest critic.  However, Sony has proven that the PS3 is the most open of the existing consoles, because the company's employees are doing everything to make it more attractive for both users and developers. ‚Äù <br><br>  According to Mr. Newell, the PS3 version of Portal 2 with Steamworks support will be out of competition.  Features of the service will allow you to quickly update the game and quickly get additional content, not to mention the multimillion Steamworks community. <br><br>  Exit Portal 2 is scheduled for 2011, the game will appear simultaneously on PC, Mac, PS3 and Xbox 360. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xWO-tNRisEE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiCjNX_8nAGJlSPfKEVX4axQKm9sQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Portal 2. Video from Sony conference at E3 2010 [HD]</b> <br><br>  The next game in the lineup of announcements from Sony was Killzone 3. The shooter, developed by Guerilla Games, will appear on store shelves in February of next year.  This was reported to us by the studio representatives immediately after the demonstration of the 3D demo version of the game.  It also became known that Killzone 3 will be released with full support for Move.  In addition to 3D graphics and a new control system, there is still a lot of interesting things waiting for us: a new firearm, an improved hand-to-hand combat, rocket packs (Jet pack), fresh locations and a completely destructible world around.  In the future, the developers promise to dedicate us to everything that is happening around their new project, according to them, the E3 exhibition will not be the last stop on the way to release. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JHe6UNbF4yU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjiB5cijD8i2i61E8VvALDSUFpr0A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>KillZone 3. Gameplay.</b>  <b>Movie from E3 2010 [HD]</b> <br><br>  Another exclusive for the PlayStation 3 will be the continuation of the much acclaimed in the past, the series Twisted Metal.  The development of a new project is occupied by the studio Eat Sleep Play.  As it became known, among the multiplayer modes Twisted Metal - online team fights, called desmatchami (deathmatch), and the new mode Capture the Faction, where players will capture the object of the opposing team.  The developers decided not to dwell on the "banal" typewriters equipped with deadly weapons, and included in the game helicopters, various vans and many other equipment, which the player can put on numerous devices to destroy the enemy. <br><br>  Sony has not yet decided on the release date of the new chisel machine, it‚Äôs only known that the game will be released in 2011.  The video, shown at the presentation of Twisted Metal, looks impressive - the improved gameplay and graphics of the new generation - all within the framework of the established traditions of the series. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JGTm3YhOJTA&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhi5zzdWWYSK-NUl4jE7JS7V2RsaEQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Twisted Metal.</b>  <b>Extended video from E3 2010 [HD]</b> <br><br>  This year, Sony does not skimp on gifts for its customers.

The beginning of European sales will start on September 15, whereas in America the novelty will appear on September 19, and in Japan and later on October 21.  The main controller will be available at a price of $ 49.99, and the auxiliary controller - for $ 29.99.

Among them, Heavy Rain, Killzone 2 and Resident Evil 5. In addition, Sony has promised to release a couple of dozen new games with support for Move by March 2011. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9rzc2JmnAI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgw7B1Pc2ykvQ60DO0y7rUktxFeBA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Kung Fu Rider.</b>  <b>Movie from E3 2010 [HD]</b> <br><br>  Two peripheral devices were also announced - a charging station and a device for firing.

The device in the format all-in-one with a sub-woofer will go on sale next fall at a price of $ 199/199 Euro.  We will not fool your head with a technical description and let's say simply: a compact novelty can easily replace a full-fledged home theater.  At least, Sony itself is positioning its device that way. <br><br>  To love Sony or not is an individual question.  Modern industry dictates its own rules, which are impossible to circumvent.  Therefore, the endless disputes of fans of the company with representatives of other communities are simply meaningless.  Sony gives us good games, some of which will be released in 3D, a variety of exclusive content and perspective Move.
