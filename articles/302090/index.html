  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Planned changes: what were the career realities of IT in a week?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Against the background of talks about the increased speed of information dissemination, the compression of markets, the acceleration of growth and disintegration of IT projects, there are thoughts about increasing the share of chaos in the industry.  It may seem that someone deliberately stirs up this whole business broth, in connection with which the so-called ‚ÄúBrownian movement‚Äù has intensified. <br><br>  However, there were bright heads, which, whether for their own peace of mind, or for the peace of those around them, included this Brownian motion in the plan.  In a plan for change.  And this plan, in turn, was part of a larger plan, which, respectively, is part of an even larger plan, and so on.  Enormous reductions, unexpected and rapid personnel changes and the very drawing up of the plan are also planned. <br><br>  Moreover, both employers and applicants are seriously engaged in this.  True, recently employers are increasingly thinking how it would be more comfortable to make reductions, and applicants, at the job search stage, are considering how to avoid possible reductions.

      Market researchers observe all this, draw beautiful charts, tables and try to predict what will happen next.  Their forecasts are read by top managers, make a plan, and so on in a circle. <br><br><h4>  Learn to learn </h4><br>  Modern students still in the universities carefully study the labor market.  Many of them rely on stable companies. <a name="habracut"></a>  And inside these companies, young employees also have to go through, a kind of ‚Äúcorporate universities‚Äù. <br><br>  1. According to the Russian students, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC">Gazprom</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a> and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AF%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581">Yandex</a> again became the leaders in the ranking of the most attractive employers.  The survey <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/society/25/05/2016/574475d39a794705ca68492b">was conducted by the</a> company <a href="http://universumglobal.com/">Universum</a> . <br><br>  Researchers surveyed more than 25 thousand students in 93 universities throughout Russia.  Future employees named the public sector (18%), IT (16%), as well as media and advertising (15%) the most attractive industries. <br><br>  Students studying in IT areas are called Google‚Äôs most attractive employer.  Yandex is in second place, Microsoft is third.  At the same time, Universum notes that students of IT specialization tend to send resumes in Yandex, not Google. <br><br>  Those who receive a liberal arts education would also most like to get into Google.  Following are Gazprom, Yandex, L'Or√©al Group and Microsoft. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05b/2d9/096/05b2d9096b46b0daff9fdad56f1a023f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The average age of students who participated in the survey was 21.8 years.  63% of respondents are female persons.  After graduation, they want to earn an average of 53.57 thousand rubles, while male respondents indicated a much higher expected salary - 65.63 thousand rubles per month. <br><br>  The main career goal of Russian students is called "stable and reliable employment."  At the same time, they are ready to adapt to the requests of the employer: the career goal ‚Äúto solve interesting and complex work tasks‚Äù has risen from third to second place, displacing ‚Äúto have a balance between work and personal life‚Äù. <br><br>  2. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_(%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258C)">"Classmates"</a> in September 2016 will launch a free educational program of additional training for programmers "Technopolis".  The St. Petersburg Polytechnic University (SPbPU) became a partner in the development of the project. <br><br>  In the framework of Technopolis, Odnoklassniki developers will teach students Java programming.  The program is designed for two years, only SPbPU students can enter it on a competitive basis.  Classes will begin in September 2016, the first stream is planned to enroll up to 40 people. <br><br>  As part of the course, students will study more than ten disciplines: from basic courses in Java and web technologies to highly specialized ones, among which are ‚ÄúInternet application security‚Äù and ‚ÄúHigh-load systems design‚Äù. <br><br>  At the end of the course, students will have to develop and submit to the expert committee their own project of a Java application.  The most successful students will be trained in the Odnoklassniki St. Petersburg office. <br><br><h4>  Yandex Week in Russia </h4><br>  This week, Yandex rescues everyone who writes news on the subject of IT and Media: only in this review, as many as four information channels are connected with this company.  In general, with ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù often this happens.  Probably, this is also included in some plan, but this time the company was just lucky with mentions. <br><br>  3. Dmitry Stepanov will no longer manage Kinopoisk and others (these are the Music, Radio, Film Search, Afisha, Ticket, and TV Program projects) of Yandex‚Äôs media projects, staff <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/05/27/642620-stepanov-kinopoiska">told</a> Vedomosti. two media companies. <br><br>  Media projects will be managed by Artyom Savinovsky, who has been working as Stepanov‚Äôs deputy since the beginning of this year.  Savinovsky has been working at Yandex for eight years, a company representative clarified, and has been involved in many projects.  Among them is the preparation of a search engine to enter the NASDAQ exchange. <br><br>  In October 2015, Yandex launched a new Kinopoisk, where the main feature was not an advisory service, as before, but an online cinema.  This caused a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/295300/">scandal</a> : users actively criticized the new service in social networks, in addition, some of the users after a restart faced technical difficulties when entering this site.  After that, Yandex returned the old version of Kinopoisk, and the online movie theater moved to the third-level domain beta.kinopoisk.ru. <br><br>  The direct project manager Olga Mansurova quit, her place was taken by Stepanov.  ‚ÄúThe restart of Kinopoisk was complicated by a number of managerial mistakes, and after analyzing the causes of the incident, I decided that I needed to fully focus on the product and take responsibility for its future,‚Äù he said then. <br><br>  As Stepanov explained, his transition is planned, before restarting Kinopoisk, he was just going to concentrate only on marketing. <br><br>  4. Igor Lutz (ex- ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù) was <a href="https://roem.ru/26-05-2016/225095/lutse-s-reklamoy/">appointed</a> to the post of Chairman of the Board of Directors of the video advertising <a href="http://www.getshop.tv/">service GetShop.TV</a> .  Anna Barinova, who previously held a similar position in the Tvigle online cinema team, has been appointed to the position of commercial director of GetShop.TV. <br><br>  In the summer of 2015, Igor Lutz left the post of director of marketing communications for Yandex, having worked in a search engine for six months.  Lutz came to Yandex in January 2015. From 1998 to 2013, Lutz worked in the Moscow branch of the international advertising agency BBDO. <br><br>  5. On May 24, 2016, Yandex announced the creation of a working group in Russia to develop C ++ programming language standards. <br><br>  The group will collect proposals for the unification of the language, organize their discussion within the country, as well as represent and defend at meetings of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).  The application with the proposal to improve the language must be made in accordance with the requirements of ISO, and after filing it must be protected at meetings of the committee of the organization, which take place in the United States or Europe. <br><br>  Standards describe the basic constructs of a programming language, the rules for their use, and also determine the vector of compiler development. <br><br>  The group plans to start work in the fall of 2016.  So, now, any developer from Russia who desires can hypothetically enter the phrase ‚Äúparticipated in the refinement of the C ++ standard‚Äù in his resume. <br><br><h4>  Planned reductions </h4><br>  May 21 edition of RBC with reference to Reuters <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/business/21/05/2016/573f95b59a7947a8311ab7f1%3Ffrom%3Dnewsfeed">reported</a> that in the near future, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia">Nokia</a> company plans to lay off more than 1,000 employees in Finland.  Nokia announced the impending reduction of 1,032 people.  Now it became known about similar plans of two superstars of the IT industry at once. <br><br>  6. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel">Intel</a> intends to close development offices in Moscow and Novosibirsk, two sources familiar with the situation <a href="https://roem.ru/27-05-2016/225242/intel-out-500/">told</a> Roem.ru.  In total, Intel employs over a thousand people in Russia, most of whom are engineers engaged in the development of devices and software. <br><br>  In Nizhny Novgorod, there is the largest Intel development center in Eastern Europe with more than 500 employees. <br><br>  As part of the global staff cuts <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/intel-outside-chip-giant-shuts-romanian-r-d-and-education-dev-hubs/">program</a> , Intel intends to lay off more than 12,000 specialists, including plans to close offices in the United States, India, Canada, Japan and Russia, according to a number of US media, citing executives of the corporation. <br><br>  It is planned to close most of the offices with a staff of less than 500 people (a number of sources call the limit of 200 people). <br><br>  7. <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> is going to exit the business of producing consumer smartphones and reform the division that deals with devices based on Windows Phone.  Recode writes about this with reference to a letter from the head of the Windows and Devices division of Terry Myerson to employees of the corporation. <br><br>  In particular, the company will fire 1,850 people (of which 1,350 worked in Finland), and also close the Finnish research and development center.  Recode <a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/5/25/11766210/microsoft-giving-up-consumer-smartphones">notes</a> that these are the ‚Äúremnants‚Äù of the smartphone division, which Microsoft acquired from Nokia for $ 7.2 billion.  The corporation will complete the cuts by July 2017, the associated losses are estimated at $ 950 million. <br><br><h4>  Unequal replacement </h4><br>  The fact that the factories and dormitories of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foxconn">Foxconn</a> , the world's leading manufacturer of electronic components, is not all as good as the company says, has been said repeatedly.  Critics have argued that it‚Äôs difficult for workers to perform monotonous duties for many hours without interruption, and the hostels provided by the company are not too different from the prison barracks. <br><br>  Yes, and the suicide rate of Foxconn employees is quite high.  The company responded to criticism that the living and working conditions would be improved.  And now the Foxconn <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276388/">management has decided to</a> start implementing a plan to optimize working conditions in their factories.  The main point of this plan is the dismissal of 60 thousand people, all of them are employees of the same factory, Kyunshan (Jiangsu Province). <br><br>  They plan to replace people with robots, which do not ask for anything and cost the company less than Chinese workers.  In addition to Foxconn, about 600 companies are planning to automate their production. <br><br>  Former McDonald's CEO Ed Rancy said in <a href="http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2016/05/24/fmr-mcdonalds-usa-ceo-35k-robots-cheaper-than-hiring-at-15-per-hour.html">an interview with</a> Fox Business that raising the minimum wage to $ 15 an hour will make the company think about replacing employees with robots.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs cheaper to buy a robotic arm for 35 thousand dollars than to hire an inept worker who will pack fries for $ 15 an hour,‚Äù he says. <br><br>  Foxconn and other Taiwanese companies have already spent more than 4 billion yuan ($ 610 million) on the robotization of their factories.  This money went not only to replace people on the conveyors with robots, but also to research in the field of artificial intelligence. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302090/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302090/</a></p>
