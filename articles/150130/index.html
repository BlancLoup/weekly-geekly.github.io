  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Russian subtitles in Coursera courses</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c62/d27/794/c62d27794d6f7bdaaf1d3f049b54f83a.jpg">  This is not the first article on Habr√© about courses provided by a team of professors <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> .  There were in general <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/147966/">about the</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/142315/">resource</a> , and about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149673/">individual courses</a> . <br>  But it seems to me that this is such a wonderful organization that it‚Äôs not a sin to remember once again. <br><br>  A big barrier to knowledge is that all courses are conducted in English.  And it repels.  I myself thought not so long ago that studying unfamiliar material in an unfamiliar language is something unimaginably difficult.  But the guys from Coursera and this problem came up with a solution - the students were given the opportunity to create a subtitle for the lectures in a fairly convenient service.  And in Russian, in spite of the not very large Russian-speaking community, they are already <a href="http://www.universalsubtitles.org/en/teams/coursera/%3Flang%3Dru">emerging</a> . <br><br>  So, in this article I am going to give a list of existing subtitles for Coursera lectures and at the same time to advertise a <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml">machine learning</a> course that just started anew this week. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's face it, there are not very many subtitles yet, basically, they are for the first couple of lectures and, for some reason, several random ones from the course (apparently, the most liked translators).  But this is quite enough to get an idea about the course and the teacher, and then either try to look with English, or convince some English-speaking friend that the course is steep and requires translation immediately.

    <h5>  Subtitles </h5>  What we have today: <br><br>  <b>Probabilistic Graphical Models</b> (Probabilistic Graphic Models) - introductory section 3 of 4 lectures +1 random <br>  <b>Cryptography</b> (Cryptography) - 4 videos from the first two blocks <br>  <b>Algorithms: Design and Analysis</b> (Algorithms: creation and analysis) - video from the first couple of blocks <br>  <b>Modelthinking</b> (Models) - several random videos <br>  <b>Software as a Service</b> (software as a service) - introductory lecture + several random videos <br>  <b>Game Theory</b> - introductory lecture <br>  <b>Introduction to Logic</b> - Introductory Lecture + Pair of Random <br>  <b>Compilers</b> introductory lecture + one more <br>  <b>Machine Learning</b> - video from the first two blocks <br>  <b>Cs101</b> - introductory lecture + a pair of random ones <br>  <b>Human Computer Interaction</b> - introductory lecture <br>  <b>Vaccines</b> (Vaccines) - first two videos <br>  <b>Internet History, Technology, and Security</b> (Internet: history, technology and protection) introductory lecture + a couple more videos <br>  <b>Fantasy And Science Fiction</b> (Fantasy and Science Fiction) - a pair of first videos <br><br>  (I can‚Äôt say about the quality of subtitles, unfortunately, there is no time to master them all) <br><br><h5>  ML </h5>  Machine learning is one of the first courses that appeared at Coursera.  And it is not surprising, because its author, Andrew Ng, is one of the founders of the company.  The course was launched for the first time in December 2011, then in April and now a new launch (with the same lectures as in April, and maybe in December). <br>  During the course of training, it is proposed to listen to lectures, answer mini-questions in the lectures themselves and to polls on the weekly unit, as well as perform programming tasks that are checked automatically, that is, there is no need to wait. <br>  At the end of the course, if you type 80% of the amount of weekly surveys and tasks for the development, get a certificate of completion of the course.  You can get these 80% even if you start to complete the course with a delay - the penalty for late delivery is just 20%, and you can reissue questions up to 100 times. <br><br>  The course is simply amazing.  First, the topic itself is interesting and quite popular (here is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/148782/">an example of use</a> ).  Secondly, Andrew talks very well for any level of training, he even explained what a derivative in passing was in one lecture (to whom it is especially boring, there is a mode of acceleration of the lecturer to 1.5).  Third, after completing the assignments, there really remain the skills of developing and understanding which way to think when confronted with one or another problem. <br><br>  And yes, by the way, this course is planned to have a stable appearance of Russian subtitles.  I do not know how else to express my gratitude to this company, except to expand the audience.  Most likely, with the speed of the course I will not have time, but I hope that I will translate it entirely once.  Edits are welcome, for this you just need to find the Help with Subtitles link and the translator for the full text on the course page =) <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : now not all Russian subtitles created by translators are displayed in lectures on the machine learning site.  People from universalsubtitles have written that they are working on this bug, but as a temporary solution I can only suggest going to the site universalsubtitles and watching lectures there - the subtitles are shown correctly on it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150130/</a></p>
