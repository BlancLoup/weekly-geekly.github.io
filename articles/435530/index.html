And who in their right mind will connect, for example, ‚ÄúHoroscope for 9p / day‚Äù (280p / month), when the Internet is full of horoscopes for every taste, and sometimes 280p is the entire budget for mobile communication expenses per month? <br><br>  Often people simply turn off the subscription, sometimes contact the operator and ask for a refund (with varying degrees of success). <br><br>  But what determines the probability that you subscribe to a subscription that you did not connect? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Several years ago, the operators were forced to enter separate accounts for content services, such a service / account is in one form or another with MTS / Beeline / Megaphone (I can‚Äôt say for Tele2 and YOTA, I don‚Äôt have a SIM card).  Operators have entered accounts, but protection against "incomprehensible subscriptions" is valid only for third-party content providers.  If the operator provides the paid subscription service, the additional account will not help - the funds are debited from the main one.  That is, others can not cheat - you can only the operator himself.

      For a long time I have been using a 3G modem in the server for sending important SMS notifications from the monitoring system.  The bulk goes through the Telegram (heh, it is forbidden on the territory of the Russian Federation, it‚Äôs good not to use it, but he himself), but the loss of communication on uplinks, the loss of power and the like goes via SMS, otherwise there is a chance that it will not come through the Internet.  For this, the mobile operator, in addition to the tariff (minute by minute, without AP), has a paid option of 100 SMS per day. <br><br>  In reality, 5-10 SMS per month can be sent via a modem, but it is easier to pay the subscriber for the option on a monthly basis and not monitor the bill. <br><br>  In principle, everything was fine, no automatic ‚Äúhoroscopes‚Äù and the like were connected for 3-4 years. <br><br>  Last December, 100 SMS were sent from the modem at a time and the number was blocked.  Because "at the same time a lot of SMS, the system has blocked you <i>automatically</i> ."  Firstly, it is strange - 100 sms per day is included in the tariff, and if you send 100, you get the blocking, and secondly, after blocking the number, the operator continued to write off the monthly fee for the blocked service for a week. <br><br>  The problem could be solved only by a visit to the office with a passport.  In the same place, the manager said that this service is outdated, and now the operator ‚Äúon all tariffs can connect an unlimited amount of SMS for 50p per month‚Äù.  To the question "whether it can be done on all tariffs, or only on existing ones", an answer was received that on all. <br><br>  As usual, the manager misled me: the option connects only on the current package tariffs with a monthly fee, and there is also a restriction on the devices: ‚Äúsmartphone, tablet‚Äù.  It is not entirely clear what is meant by this, and is it possible to use the option on ‚ÄúNokia with a flashlight‚Äù and similar push-button phones - not smartphones. <br><br>  There was a desire to try to connect such a package (tariff + option), at a price similarly with a package of 100 SMS.  At the same time, since there are included minutes in the package, you can configure asterisk and, in addition to SMS, make a call via a modem. <br><br>  <s>For this, voice functions were enabled in the modem settings, and the IMEI of my long-broken iPad</s> was installed. For this, the SIM card was inserted into the iPad. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">because it is legal to change IMEI in the Russian Federation - it‚Äôs not completely clear</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  For example, who authorized the possibility of modifying and copying data in my modem?  And is the HEX-editor a ‚Äúcomputer program deliberately intended for unauthorized modification of computer information‚Äù? <br><br>  Therefore, if you use computer programs, make sure in advance of their intended purpose. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Of the Criminal Code of the RF Article 273</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation Article 273. Creation, use and distribution of malicious computer programs (as amended by Federal Law of 07.12.2011 N 420-) <br><br>  1. Creation, distribution or <b>use of computer programs</b> or other computer information that are <b>known to be used for</b> unauthorized destruction, blocking, <b>modifying</b> , <b>copying</b> computer information or neutralizing computer information protection tools, is punished by restriction of freedom for up to four years, or by forced labor for four years, or imprisonment for the same period with a fine of up to two hundred thousand rubles, or in the amount of wages or other income  nnogo for a period of eighteen months. <br><br>  2. Deeds stipulated by the first part of this article, committed by a group of persons in a preliminary conspiracy or organized group or a person using their official position, as well as causing major damage or committed out of mercenary interest, - shall be punished with restriction of liberty for up to four years, or forced works for up to five years with the deprivation of the right to occupy certain positions or engage in certain activities for a period of up to three years or without it, or imprisonment  for a period of up to five years with a fine in the amount of one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand rubles, or in the amount of wages or other income of the convict for a period of two to three years or without such and with the deprivation of the right to hold certain positions or engage in certain activities for up to three years or not. <br><br>  3. Deeds stipulated in the first or second part of this article, if they have entailed grave consequences or created a threat of their occurrence, shall be punished with imprisonment for up to seven years. <br></div></div></div></div><br>  If it were not for this incomprehensible moment in the legislation, it is very beneficial to connect such a tariff for sending SMS via a modem.  And so it remains only to connect Nokia and send it via gnokii / gammu. <br><br>  The tariff and tariff options did not change, on the operator‚Äôs side only IMEI devices changed ( <i>we inserted SIM into iPad instead of E1550 modem ;-)</i> ) <br><br>  And then it began: <br><br><blockquote>  5016 <br>  2018-12-14 12:44:56 <br>  Video reviews of football matches, Game results and statistics of the Championships of Russia, Spain, France and other countries on the Football portal: life. ******* ru / football </blockquote>  After 30 seconds <br><br><blockquote>  5016 <br>  2018-12-14 12:45:22 <br>  You have subscribed to the Football Portal subscription.  Management: podpiski **. Ru Abon.  fee: 9 rubles.  with VAT per day </blockquote><blockquote>  5151 <br>  2019-01-01 05:13:52 <br>  You have subscribed to Astroportal.  Now the signs of destiny will be solved: personal horoscopes, dream secrets and fortune telling are available to you.  Subscription price: 7 rubles per day.  Details: life. *******. Ru / astro </blockquote><blockquote>  5016 <br>  2019-01-09 12:50:16 <br>  Learn the latest results of the Championships of Russia, England and Spain.  Play online football games and watch the bright goals of all time on the Football Portal: <br>  life. *******. ru / football </blockquote><br>  After 30 seconds <br><br><blockquote>  5151 <br>  2019-01-09 12:50:42 <br>  You have subscribed to Football.  Now the news in the world of football will not pass you by: video reviews, team ratings, online games. Subscription price: 9 rubles per day.  Details: life. *******. Ru / football </blockquote>  I would write it off on the New Year hunger of the operator, who decided to make money quickly (well, or ‚Äúincrease conversion‚Äù), but on other SIM cards with the same tariff, this disgrace was not noticed.  Advertising comes, but auto connect does not happen after 30 seconds. <br><br>  Moreover, technical support memorized responds to the claim: <br><br><blockquote> Return for subscriptions is possible once.  Therefore, a second refund is currently unavailable.  Often, subscription connection occurs by clicking on the button ‚Äúwatch movie‚Äù / ‚Äúlisten to music‚Äù / ‚Äúdownload‚Äù - depending on the content of the site.  Unfortunately, users do not always pay due attention to the terms of service: the conditions are usually indicated on the periphery of the page.  To date, there are many sites that use our carelessness to your advantage.  In this situation, I can advise you to be extremely careful in the future when clicking on links such as ‚ÄúView‚Äù / ‚ÄúListen‚Äù / ‚ÄúDownload‚Äù and always pay due attention to the text with the conditions for granting access to the content you are interested in. </blockquote>  And they are absolutely not worried about the fact that on this phone / personal account number the amount of downloaded traffic is 0.00MB from the moment of connection, that is, in ~ 5 years.  What kind of links they are talking about is not clear. <br><br>  And the most enchanting answer: <br><br><blockquote>  You could subscribe to the subscription through another device, simply by entering your phone number when registering on the site. </blockquote>  What??  Is it really possible?  Specify any arbitrary phone number on a certain site, and a paid subscription will be connected to this phone number? <br><br>  It is doubly unpleasant that the subscription fee for such a subscription is deducted at the time of its connection.  That is, if you turn it off immediately - 9 p.  still have to pay. <br><br>  I think the billing system of the cellular operator knows perfectly well where this or that paid subscription came from - follow the link, send an SMS or USSD, connect to your personal account and so on.  But in case the subscriber's device is a smartphone or tablet, you can always write off the subscription connection to the fact that the subscription was activated by an application installed by the subscriber or he ‚Äúclicked something on the Internet‚Äù. <br><br>  From the above, the conclusion is that the operator imposes its deliberately fraudulent subscriptions, including the type of device that you use to connect to the operator‚Äôs network.  Because you can write off a subscription connection to the subscriber's actions.  Some kind of IMEI discrimination: if you have an iPad - get a horoscope and football for 9p / day.  It is much more difficult to convince a subscriber with a Nokia 3310 pushbutton that he subscribed to the subscription ‚Äúon the Internet‚Äù. <br><br>  UPD: the probable reason for the automatic connection of subscriptions immediately after the advertising SMS was described by <a href="https://habr.com/users/baruk/" class="user_link">baruk</a> <a href="https://habr.com/post/435530/">in his comment</a> : <br><blockquote>  the customer is sent a push with a proposal for branded services after receiving A2P sms ... in the OKS7 logs, they saw that the modem sent an SMS in response to the dstk-push, while there were no indications of the push coming in the modem's logs, there was no SMS sending. </blockquote><br>  That is, some devices display PUSH-and with offers to connect a paid service on the screen, sometimes with the "OK" and "Cancel" buttons.  And there are devices (for example, some modems) that can not ‚Äúdisplay‚Äù PUSH, and in response they themselves always send ‚Äúok‚Äù, there they agree on the connection. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/435530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/435530/</a></p>
