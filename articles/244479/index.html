Looking for a bug is even worse.  They can be either harmless (but annoying) or very catastrophic, the consequences of which can lead to financial losses, blackening of reputation and even to tragic cases. <br><br>  However, not all bugs are like that.  There are also those from whom you wouldn‚Äôt pick up hair on your head or break a computer monitor with improvised objects.  They would rather make you laugh, well, or at least smile.  It is about these bugs and will be discussed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bd/fc2/6fd/3bdfc26fda414ccf901a39e867de809d.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h5>  Oh lucky </h5><br>  May 1996.  The most ordinary working morning of the most ordinary employee of a Chicago company.  He decides to go to the bank in order to find out how much blood he has in his account.  And there is only 900 million dollars!  You can imagine his facial expression at that moment. <br><br>  The fact is that this person, along with other 825 clients of the First National Bank of Chicago, became a victim (if it can be said so) of an error in the bank‚Äôs system - a bug, thanks to which all these people could call themselves billionaires during the day.  Of course, no one stole the money and did not run away to distant islands under a new name and false mustache, since the funds transferred to the ‚Äúlucky ones‚Äù greatly exceeded the assets of the bank.  As a result, it was the biggest and most expensive mistake ever made in the American banking system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22a/f14/79e/22af1479eef24457b304e58b4dfaa921.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Big ego phone </h5><br>  In 2010, the response to the iPhone in the face, or rather, in the Windows Phone display, appeared on the mobile device market.  Later, in 2012, the next version appeared - Windows Phone 8. Nothing catastrophic happened until the user decided to upgrade the software.  At this point, the phone produced a stunning message - ‚ÄúInsert the Windows installation disc and restart your computer.‚Äù  How and where to insert the disk, the phone did not specify.  The bug occurred because the core of Windows Phone OS is based on Windows NT 1993.  For this reason, the phone sometimes considers itself a real stationary computer. <br><br>  So, even small devices have a dream to become big and strong. <br><br><h5>  Betrayal </h5><br>  Siri is a personal assistant to iPhone and iPad owners, able to communicate with them through question-answer.  In 2012, Siri had a bug that made her betray the iPhone.  The program ‚ÄúNokia Lumia 900 4G‚Äù answered the question ‚ÄúWhich phone is the best in the world?‚Äù  The reason for this strange behavior was that the request was transmitted to the Wolfram Alpha system, which was served by another company.  The system, in turn, produced a response based on statistical data and user feedback. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23e/97a/701/23e97a701c354c85b02c07879f79a618.jpg"><br><br>  Naturally, this bug was destroyed.  Now the program answered the sacred question: ‚ÄúAre you kidding?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúThe one that is in your hands.‚Äù <br><br><h5>  Sims 3 </h5><br>  From the very start, in 2009, Sims 3 acquired a whole army of fans.  This computer simulation game was no exception and kept a lot of bugs.  One of which the fans decided to highlight.  Namely, the bug distorts the image of the baby.  Having performed certain actions (wearing a child in certain types of clothing) a very awesome picture could be observed. <br><br>  Another bug is the ability to create an army of babies.  If you change the name of the child, a new one will appear, and so on to infinity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c47/9f3/004/c479f300466e496c8940501cb3901515.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Little cracker </h5><br>  When the family has small children and a game console, the parents restrict the access of their children to the content ‚Äúfor adults‚Äù.  For example, Xbox One allows you to set up multiple accounts for different users.  One for the child, the other for the parents. <br><br>  That is how it was in the family of five Christopher Wilhelm von Hassel.  However, in March 2014, the baby tried to log in to the father‚Äôs account.  After the first unsuccessful password entry attempt, the young hacker simply entered several spaces into the field, which allowed him to gain access to all of his father‚Äôs games.  He told his father, who by coincidence, worked in the field of information security.  The parent reported a Microsoft problem that eradicated the bug.  And the boy's name was posted on the Microsoft website in the section "security researchers in March 2014". <br><br>  This is how Christopher became the smallest hacker in the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6e/606/4da/b6e6064da4f649e28f733f691e63b1f1.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Oh, it's not for you. </h5><br>  How inconvenient it turns out when the message of a personal nature goes to the wrong person.  For example, an invitation to a romantic dinner sent by your beloved one and got to the boss.  Of course, it would be even more strange to get a satisfactory answer.  This problem was observed among Android users, or rather the Android Messaging Application.  For the first time complaints about the confusion of recipients appeared in 2010, July 28.  However, the company did not want to recognize the existence of the bug until January 5, 2011. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b1/de3/213/6b1de321327744a78fbf7964d9bf3997.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Aroma of freedom </h5><br>  In 2011, California prisons were faced with the problem of lack of space.  It was decided to conditionally release a number of those prisoners whose crimes were committed long ago and have a low degree of public danger.  Simply put, he stole 5 bucks - he was free, he killed a man - you can't see the age of will. <br><br>  The bug of the program led to the fact that, among others, 450 people were released with the burden of violence and about 1000 criminals who were able to repeat the theft and return to the use of drugs.  In addition, all these good people were released not conditionally, but completely.  Nobody ever looked for and returned the prodigal sons. <br><br>  A similar situation occurred between 2003 and 2006 in Michigan, where 23 criminals were mistakenly released.  True, most of them were ordinary fraudsters who did not use violence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb6/b3e/ec0/fb6b3eec04fe44ad9ec05071c9378583.jpg"><br><br><h5>  They told you: "Turn off the light in the toilet" </h5><br>  The following incident occurred in the city of Lancashire.  The Brotherton family, Nigel and Linda, decided to change the electricity supplier from Scottish Power to Npower.  The next month, they received a bill in the amount of a lot of 53,480,062 pounds.  Note that the previous score was only 87 pounds.  The bug occurred due to the fact that an employee of the company connecting the house saw ‚Äú0‚Äù on the meter and indicated this in the receipt.  The computer processing this data decided that the meter made the maximum possible turnovers and calculated their cost. <br><br>  The head of the affected family said: ‚ÄúIt's good that they did not try to withdraw this amount from my account.  Not only would I exceed my credit limit, but the bank would also go bankrupt. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c4/b7e/3f4/6c4b7e3f42c242188128b7ee04ae877e.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Blue screen of death </h5><br>  In the spring of 1998, a presentation of the new Windows 98 took place. A scanner was connected to the computer, which was supposed to be detected by the system and begin to work successfully.  This was done through plug and play software.  However, immediately after connecting the system fell, and everyone saw the blue screen of death. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/73wMnU7xbwE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjxYPrafTdmLA2kIyrjk41fUmoZJA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the end, Bill Gates said: "Apparently, because we are not selling Windows 98 yet." <br><br><h5>  You do not like cats? </h5><br>  Minecraft is an extremely fashionable and popular game in which you can build almost everything, if only fantasy does not let you down.  And she served someone for the glory, as this man created a fountain of cats.  In the game world there are cats that are tamed and then follow the player along the ground.  If the player is too far away, the cats simply teleport to him.  If you climb a tall, high pole, the cats will appear in an endless stream, forming a cat's fountain. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/iNw2YcAK9Wc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhysvHTJ5Oe0pfgdYnCoDnP475cBg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In the video, the author explains the behavioral traits of gaming cats and tells how long and diligently he tried to implement this engineering marvel.  This, of course, is difficult to call a bug, but it looks very funny. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6ce/377/72c/6ce37772c6c6440dba5977cccbc73508.jpg"><br><br>  Programming is a complex and creative process.  Bugs are an integral part of it.  Let them make you laugh and not grieve.  Good luck to you programming, and love cats. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244479/</a></p>
