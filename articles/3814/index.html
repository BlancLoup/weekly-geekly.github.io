  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rating of mortgage banks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>The mortgage lending market over the past year showed good growth results and approached the figure of $ 5 billion against about $ 3 billion in 2006.</b>  <b>The top three in terms of mortgage loans issued in 2006, compared with the results of the first half of the year, has changed.</b>  <b>The first two leaders of Sberbank ($ 4.3 billion) and VTB 24 ($ 756.7 million) were joined by Moskommertsbank ($ 620 million), pushing DeltaCredit from third to fifth place.</b> <br><br>  The undisputed leader in increasing the volume among large mortgage banks was KIT Finance, which increased its volume from $ 3 to $ 277.7 million over the last year of operation.  The second ‚Äúin terms of growth‚Äù growth was the ‚ÄúMoscow Bank for Reconstruction and Development‚Äù, which increased its volume 72 times, from 1.4 million to 105.3 million dollars. Transcreditbank showed quite good growth rates - almost 36 times, up to 241 million dollars. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to Maria Serova, head of credit development and partner programs at VTB 24, in conditions of high real estate price growth rates mortgage lending is probably the only effective tool for solving housing problems for most Russian families.  The marked growth in the mortgage lending market in 2006 is partly a result of the rapid growth in housing prices. <br><br>  Over the past year, banks have significantly expanded their credit programs, which could not but affect the volume of the market.  As the most interesting, experts allocate loans with zero down payment, loans with a floating rate, loans for rooms, as well as refinancing programs for mortgage loans, lombard loans, loans for the purchase of suburban real estate.  According to Mikhail Busygin, Deputy Head of the Sales Department of the City Mortgage Bank, one of the trends in the mortgage market this year will be a significant expansion of the product line of mortgage banks.  This will allow the general public to choose a mortgage loan that is appropriate for them.

      Almost all experts agree that this is only the beginning of the growth of mortgage lending.  ‚ÄúAccording to all forecasts, the volume of the mortgage market should grow another 2 times.  We follow the path of all the countries of Eastern Europe, where from the moment when the market began to develop, double growth was observed for 3-4 years.  We have actually just entered this phase of growth.  But before the Eastern European market, where 30-40% of real estate transactions are made with a mortgage, we are still very far to catch up with us, we will need several years of double growth, ‚Äùsays Olga Bazanova, director of marketing for the mortgage bank DeltaCredit. <br><br>  With the development of the mortgage lending market, the sector of refinancing of previously issued loans is actively developing.  It allows borrowers to reduce the cost of interest payments at the expense of on-lending to other banks at more favorable interest rates.  According to Tatyana Voznesenskaya, Chairman of the Board of the Russian Mortgage Bank, ‚Äúwe should expect a substantial increase in offers related to the crediting of previously issued mortgage loans.  This service will be in demand and will be developed due to the continuing decline in interest rates on mortgage loans. ‚Äù <br><br>  In 2007, we should expect the further development of securitization of mortgage loans by banks.  ‚ÄúSecuritization is probably the most important source of mortgage refinancing for our banks, which, given the overall low capitalization of the Russian banking system, is very important.  As well as a direct tool for lowering interest rates for borrowers by attracting cheaper funding, ‚Äùsays Hisbertdinov Albert, first deputy chairman of the board of Moskommertsbank. <br><br>  However, its development requires changes to the Federal Law ‚ÄúOn Mortgage Securities‚Äù.  ‚ÄúThe insurance issue, according to Olga Bazanova, director of marketing for the mortgage bank DeltaCredit, is holding back the issue of mortgage-backed bonds.  There is an urgent need to adopt a number of amendments to this law.  Also in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãsecuritization of mortgage assets, there are some difficulties.  We very much hope that the Central Bank will review the capital adequacy requirement for banks that issue mortgage-backed bonds.  Today it is 14%, while other banks have a capital adequacy requirement of 10%.  This increased attention on the part of the regulator is very disturbing, since, with due attention of the organizers to the quality of the issue, the securitization of Russian mortgage loans will reduce mortgage rates for the population. ‚Äù <br><br>  Reducing the refinancing rate of the Central Bank, in the opinion of many banking specialists, will not greatly affect the market situation.  ‚ÄúMost likely, in no way,‚Äù concludes the head of the retail lending department of the TransCreditBank retail business department, Grigory Ivashchenko, ‚ÄúThe refinancing rate of the Central Bank has long failed to reflect the cost of resources for the bank.  Perhaps some banks will be followed by a slight decrease in interest rates on loans issued in Russian rubles.  But it will not happen immediately, but in a period from 1 to 6 months. ‚Äù <br><br>  Evaluating the prospects for the development of mortgages in terms of attracting customers, against the background of tougher competition, banks are trying to occupy more free niches, for example, the regional or primary housing market. <br><br>  Since mortgage offers do not keep pace with the rise in real estate prices in large cities, many banks are focused on the development of mortgages in the regions.  Property prices there are not very high, and the population can afford to purchase it through a mortgage.  Thus, according to Khisametdinov Albert, the first deputy chairman of the board of Moskommertsbank, the bank sees high prospects for the development of mortgage in regional markets. <br><br>  The offers on the secondary housing market are theoretically limited, in contrast to the primary one, the growth of which depends only on the volume of construction that is constantly growing.  In the total amount of mortgage loans issued, according to bank statistics, only about 30% fall on the primary housing market, which is quite small in the total volume of the real estate market.  Thus, this market direction is very attractive for the provision of mortgage loans.  As Grigory Ivashchenko, head of the retail lending department of TransCreditBank‚Äôs retail business department, noted, in 2007 it is possible to increase the number of loans issued for the purchase of apartments in the primary housing market. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe growth of mortgage lending will be promoted, first of all, by an increase in housing construction.  - says the Deputy Chairman of the Board of Absolut Bank Oleg Skvortsov - Since today the current needs of the population in new housing are not being met. ‚Äù <br><br>  Among the restraining factors in mortgage development, many experts point out low and non-transparent incomes of Russians, high housing prices and a shortage in the supply of quality housing, as well as a low level of public awareness about mortgages. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://klubib.ru/articles/read.php%3Farticle_id%3D9">Mortgage Brokers Club</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/3814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/3814/</a></p>
