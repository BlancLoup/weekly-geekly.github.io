This is especially noticeable in the IT world, where any idea is implemented with great speed, and just as quickly, such an idea begins to diverge around the world.  Large corporations are constantly borrowing something from each other, whether they are separate functions of the browser, the program interface, or the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an Internet tablet.  Now, Microsoft has decided to actively pursue a rather long-announced Streetside service, which is an analogue of Google Street View. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  To this end, work has begun on collecting visual information in European cities, including London.  True, the purpose of such work is to ‚Äúuncover‚Äù the streets of only the major cities of Europe, and active work is now underway in the UK.  Previously, the Streetside service was announced in the USA; it should be noted that quite a few users began to work with this service immediately after its appearance.

      Interestingly, Microsoft is now trying not to attack the rakes that were scattered on Google‚Äôs way - attacks on the corporation about violation of various countries ‚Äôprivacy laws of users continue to this day.  Google cars were photographed by Asian panties hanging on a string on the street.  Google took a picture of someone's house, whose owner was outraged by the ‚Äúrude invasion‚Äù of his life.  And then in general, when collecting various information cars Google in Europe, the corporation randomly collected data from open Wi-Fi networks. <br><br>  It is clear that when implementing such large-scale projects as Google Street View, errors are inevitable, and now Microsoft is trying to avoid these errors.  So, before appearing in any region, Microsoft will publish ads in local newspapers about the beginning of the work of the Streetside team.  In addition, a ‚Äúhot line‚Äù will be created, along which any citizen, dissatisfied with the fact that his / her underwear was photographed at his house or his own, can call and ask to ‚Äúcover up‚Äù himself or his property in Streetside photographs.  In general, the plan is really good - with such an approach, Microsoft is unlikely to have many problems with local laws. <br><br>  Plus, the Streetside project is also occupied by representatives of several human rights organizations that are very well versed in laws relating to the private life of an individual.  Thus, such organizations will be able to help the software giant to avoid careless mistakes. <br><br>  However, it is still unknown whether the Streetside service will be popular in Europe, and whether it can become a worthy competitor to Google Street View. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/microsoft/8444721/Microsoft-Bing-begins-work-on-Streetview-rival-Streetside.html">telegraph</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/117458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/117458/</a></p>
