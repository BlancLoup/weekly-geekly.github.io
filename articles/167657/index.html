      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      And you will start thinking through what functionality you will need in order for the client to find exactly on your website what you were looking for (product description, useful articles, photos, etc.). <br><br>  And most likely, you will try to immediately think through as many nuances as possible. <br><br>  How, where and how much will you register a company, whom to take as partners (two or three of them are much simpler ...) <br><br>  Think over what menu items (sections of the site) you need: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><ul><li>  main page - with beautiful animation </li><li>  catalog - with the widest functionality </li><li>  contacts - with driving directions </li><li>  news or articles - with super helpful articles </li><li>  blog or news - where you'll publish all sorts of project news </li><li>  buttons integration with the most popular social.  networks - in order for visitors to the site to get real pleasure from the articles on your site, to share with friends and create you an additional stream of traffic </li><li>  a section with a thematic forum - where visitors to your site will discuss all possible questions and problems related to the subject of your business.  They will be able to communicate with each other and organize a kind of interest club. </li><li>  etc. </li></ul><br><br>  In addition, decide whether you need to create your video channel on YouTube, a thematic group in Facebook, a thematic group in Vkontakte and in all possible social networks, in order to attract additional traffic. <br><br>  Then decide that placing orders and receiving payments on the site should be as automated as possible and there should be as many payment methods as possible. <br><br>  Then decide that +100.5 million product descriptions to upload to the site with your hands are also not an option, and decide that you must choose the most multifunctional (possibly paid) online store engine, which should contain: <br><br><ul><li>  perfectly customizable multifunctional product catalog </li><li>  multifunctional admin with the ability to bulk load goods </li><li>  the ability to keep records of goods in stock </li><li>  accounting of documents (after all, you will have employees, and you will send them something, and billing, contracts and invoices have not been canceled yet) </li><li>  etc. </li></ul><br><br>  In general, it is possible to sufficiently think over (fantasize) all the details of your business for 10 years ahead ... <br><br>  Plus, if you also have technical knowledge (you are a programmer), then the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãdeveloping all this functionality from scratch can get into your head. <br>  (I confirm the last thesis from my own experience ...) <br><br>  And here you are satisfied with yourself, having understood that already the first plan of action on building a mega huge Internet corporation you have already sketched, you will begin to implement it! <br><br>  And, as usual, start with what you can (right from everything on the list :)). <br><br>  And what happens then !? <br><br>  And then everything is sadly simple ... <br><br>  Unfortunately, and I am no exception, most start-up entrepreneurs start with anything, just not to try at least something, at least somehow sell ... <br><br>  You have outlined to yourself a huge number of all sorts of complex tasks that, in your opinion, form the basis of the business. <br><br>  At the same time, without even realizing that each of the tasks (website, blog, forum, working with social networks, etc.) is a difficult project and the necessary time costs are a separate project! <br><br>  On the rise, which (before the turn, when it starts to bring you money) you need to spend a lot of time and effort. <br><br>  And, while you are engaged in building up in the future a huge, convenient for all (customers, you, contractors, suppliers) and highly profitable online store, your sales (your business) stand still. <br><br>  And, in the end, with a high degree of probability, you simply exhale instead of even the most modest but working store, you will receive a bunch of unfinished and unfinished code, ruins ... <br><br>  What to do, you ask? <br><br>  This is where the saying ‚ÄúElephants eat bit by bit‚Äù and one statement ‚ÄúAny business begins with the sale‚Äù will help! <br><br>  These are two rules that no matter how obvious they are, many future entrepreneurs and businessmen constantly forget. <br><br>  And now a summary or recommendations for action: <br><br><ul><li>  First of all, choose one or a small group of products from which you will start sales (when there are not thousands of goods, but dozens, it will be enough to figure out why they are needed and what are their advantages and benefits for the customer) </li><li>  Publish on the Internet "at least where" information that you sell these products with price and contact details ("at least where" are all kinds of bulletin boards, forums and gathering places for your potential customers, free hosting, a mini-website, a one-page website, etc.) d.)  It is important that a potential client could find out somewhere that you are selling this product and have the opportunity to contact you. </li><li>  Be sure to include your contact information on the product description page (email, phone).  If you think that customers will come to you at night, then you can register in the payment acceptance service and create a button on the ordering for the goods through it (the most similar coding is not reasonable to write in my opinion ...) </li><li>  And then, start promoting your products and services everywhere and catch target traffic to your product description pages. <br>  And already when the real orders and payments go, only then begin to increase your Internet project, adding more and more new features. </li></ul><br><br>  Until you started selling (until you went orders and payments) spend all your efforts and time to search and attract new customers!  Everything else, at this stage is unimportant and irrelevant to the business! <br><br>  That's all for now! <br><br>  I hope the material will help you get around those rakes, about which many young Internet projects are divided ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167657/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167657/</a></p>
