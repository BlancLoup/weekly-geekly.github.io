Next year, these chips can be seen in many top smartphones. <br><br>  Apparently, Qualcomm expects next year the massive deployment of 5G networks in different regions of the world. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In a <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/13662/qualcomm-tech-summit-day-1-announcing-5g-partnerships-and-snapdragon-855">presentation</a> and promotional video, the company demonstrates the capabilities of smartphones and other mobile devices with the new Snapdragon 855 chip. These include:

Qualcomm claims that this is the first mobile platform with full 5G support at speeds of a few gigabits per second. <br><br>  Earlier it was reported that Snapdragon 855 is manufactured using the 7 nm process technology, whereas previous Snapdragon chips 835 and 845 were manufactured using the 10 nm process technology. <br><br>  Some details of the chipset are also disclosed: as reported, the industry-leading AI engine is integrated into the S855, as well as hardware acceleration of the augmented reality, that is, virtual reality and augmented reality.  The fifth-generation multi-core AI engine in the S855, according to Qualcomm, is three times more powerful than the AI ‚Äã‚Äãin the S845 model. <br><br>  It also says that the new S855 includes a separate DSP for image processing computer vision.  Also, according to the company, "the first in the industry."  It will speed up the functions of computer graphics and video.  Qualcomm mentioned the games, promising a "new level of gaming experience" for the next generation of premium flagship devices. <br><br>  Officially announced the new sensor 3D Sonic Sensor to scan fingerprints <b>across the surface of the display</b> .  It was stated that this technology could work through protective films, and also offers additional levels of security compared with other solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ct/qm/j7/ctqmj7o2yhl35ptxqwwnet4fnfy.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition to Qualcomm, presentations were made by representatives of US mobile operators AT &amp; T and Verizon, they shared their plans to deploy 5G networks.  In their opinion, ultimately, cellular networks will become a combination of 5G, 4G and Wi-Fi networks, since each technology is better suited for a particular application. <br><br>  Representatives of Google, Samsung and OnePlus at the conference talked about how 5G integrates with their technologies.  According to Qualcomm, at present, plans for the introduction of a new Snapdragon 855 chip and 5G networks have been agreed with 20 operators and 18 equipment OEMs. <br><br>  In addition, the conference was a live demonstration of equipment with support for 5G from AT &amp; T and Verizon, including the Snapdragon 855 mobile platform in devices of various form factors that were connected to the local 5G network of each company. <br><br>  There were some official announcements.  For example, Samsung <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-verizon-will-partner-on-5g-smartphone-in-first-half-of-2019/">announced</a> the release of the 5G smartphone in the first half of 2019 in partnership with Verizon.  The new device will have a Qualcomm X50 modem installed.  The director of the Samsung mobile direction announced the release of another device for South Korea in March 2019, it will become the first 5G phone from Samsung. <br><br>  Lenovo and Motorola intend to release 5G 'moto mod' for Motorola z3 smartphone. <br><br>  Agency Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-03/apple-is-said-to-miss-rapid-5g-takeoff-sitting-out-tech-shift">reports</a> that in 2019, Apple will not have time to release a smartphone with 5G support. <br><br>  Since October, Verizon has been deploying 5G-to-Wifi service in the US market, although it cannot be called a normal 5G: it does not meet industry standards and requires additional equipment to convert a 5G signal to traditional Wi-Fi. <br><br>  Qualcomm also introduced its 5G logos, which device manufacturers can use.  Probably, in 2019 such badges will appear in many promotional materials: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e5/m-/73/e5m-73p32xrr65-udsxehadxe94.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432210/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432210/</a></p>
