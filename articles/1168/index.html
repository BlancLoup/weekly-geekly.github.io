We will fix this topic.  So let's see which of you at home is engaged in the repetition of the material covered, and who is stupidly watching a house or two. <br>  - Just do not need so much pathos!  - said from the spot - She will look ... But who are you, eh?  With the diction of garbage is complete, and there too - the teacher from himself writhes. <br>  - Well done Petrov!  Immediately you can see an excellent student.  Obhamil out of the blue.  Everything is as it should be.  Sit down - five. <br>  - I did not get up.  Do not flatter yourself!  You have sore vanity. <br>  - Umnichka! <br><a name="habracut"></a>  - Do not hang tags here!  - the girl has risen - It is not up to you to decide who is clever and who is not.  I generally hate teachers with all my heart.  They are always drunk and in blue crumpled robes go! <br>  - Is it? <br>  - Yes!  Yesterday I saw that the Trudovik was coming.  Drunk, in a blue mint coat.  Yes, I poke!  He says - you, girl, which is not in the classroom ... And from the very same rushing pedagogy.  I already shaken all!  And what is the most offensive of all - all such, all!  The teacher can always find out - he is in a blue robe and drunk! <br>  - Well done!  All teachers are the same comb on the basis of a single labor!  Umnichka!  This is the topic!  Is vital! <br>  - That's it!  Podonkovsky comments, and there - in the teacher climb !!!  - the girl got puffed up. <br>  - Shut up!  - clanged the metal in the teacher's voice - Historically, we, teachers, taught, teach and we will teach you!  Clear?! <br>  - Yes, I finished school 15 years ago!  It's time to get used to the idea that you are not my teacher! <br>  - Ay, well done! <br>  - Do not be distructed! <br>  - Yeah.  Well, in gratitude for the fact that I taught you everything - and you can show respect!  I made a man out of you! <br>  - Yes Yes.  No one knows what would have happened if I had not a teacher, but a governess !!!  Maybe I would have already received 2 Nobel! <br>  - Yes Yes!  Governess like you head knocking on the board! <br>  - I do not want to talk to you!  You hopelessly stupid! <br>  - Good, Lenochka.  Five.  Who else?  Senya? <br>  - What are you attached to?  Have you had sex for a long time?  - barked Simon, not rising. <br>  - Well done!  Vasya? <br>  - I have long wanted to tell you.  Your daughter is pregnant by me. <br>  - On the brink, Vassenka, on the brink.  Well?  The main argument?  The most important? <br>  - Kill yourself!  - Bark barked class. <br>  - Wonderful.  And now let's move on to the next topic ... <br>  - What are you merging?  What are you draining, kiso?  - shouted from the last party. <br>  - Ivanov!  Can't stop on time?  Get out of the classroom!  And tomorrow with my parents! <br>  - Brothers, this kiso banned me and squeezed into the abuse!  - boasted Ivanov leaving the classroom. <br><br>  Took from <a href="http://www.webpark.ru/comments.php%3Fid%3D19416">Webpark.ru</a> </div>
