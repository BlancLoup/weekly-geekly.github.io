    <h5>  Determining the type of application and overall strategy </h5><br><br>  To understand how and who needs to advertise an application, you first need to determine what type it belongs to and what should be achieved with the help of advertising.  To do this, you can refer to the following table, which helps to choose the best advertising strategy: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/041/4af/69f/0414af69fc878bc4c5c26047afbe61c9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's take a closer look at each of the strategies: <br><br>  1) Tops and charts are applications for which popularity it is necessary to organize mass demand and ensure their presence in the charts (best free, editorial choice, etc.).  They are always conditionally free. <br><br>  2) Number of installations - the driving force of this strategy is finding in the first places of the search by categories.  We recommend using package monetization of the application and demo version. <br><br>  3) Targeted - when distributing the application in this case, the emphasis is on point advertising for the end user.  Our tips for this type of advertising are similar to the recommendations for the second type. <br><br><h5>  Budget calculation </h5><br><br>  For applications such as "Targeting", advertising platforms mostly provide statistics, thanks to which advertising budget can be easily calculated.  For the ‚ÄúTops and Charts‚Äù and ‚ÄúNumber of Installations‚Äù types, it is necessary to start analyzing competitors in this field. <br><br>  For example, you created an application.  In order to get to the ‚ÄúTops‚Äù you need to generate from 8 to 15 thousand downloads within the first 72 hours after the release, while putting special emphasis on the last 24 hours.  For the ‚ÄúNumber of installations‚Äù type, it is necessary to study the categories in which you would like to see your application in the highest positions.  In this case, it takes an average of 1 to 5 thousand downloads for the selected category. <br><br>  To understand the percentage of downloads, here is the table: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c1/5ab/580/4c15ab5805470eddffd62089828c21b9.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Prerelease activity </h5><br><br>  At the considered stage, it is necessary to form the main consumers of the product, product or service offered by you, as well as to prepare the basic tools: <br><br>  1. Landing page or in another way a landing page is a page referred to in advertisements, search engines, banners, social networks, etc .; <br><br>  2. Preparation of banners.  Even the most skillful advertiser, carefully and for a long time developing the ‚Äúideal‚Äù banner, taking into account the full information about the advertising target audience, cannot give 100% guarantee that this banner will definitely attract the user.  That is why we recommend developing at least 10 banners.  In addition, it is important to regularly expand this package of banners, since within a month, literally all interested users will see your ad and they either get bored or stop paying attention to it.  Users need to be surprised! <br><br>  3. Setting the trailer.  All trailers can be divided into three main types: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ teaser is a production video, designed to describe all the advantages of your application; <br>  ‚Ä¢ video presentation of the application offered by you; <br>  ‚Ä¢ gameplay video used for advertising games and representing the interface recording and the game component of your application itself. <br><br>  4. The pre-order tool is an interesting device.  For example, you, when requesting an email from a user, promise to notify him of changes in your application (start of action, discounts, launch, new interface, etc.), for the installation of which he will receive some bonus in the application after release. <br><br><h5>  Viral mechanisms </h5><br><br>  Often, viral mechanisms turn an application into a source of spam, which is extremely annoying to users.  This is the main mistake of the developers of these products.  In the case of viral mechanisms, the following should be considered first: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúViralka‚Äù is a word of mouth, and by no means spam. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The quality of the application is the main thing; its mechanism is secondary. <br><br>  The main problem in our opinion is that the developed application no more obtrusively pushes the user to tell his friends, friends and colleagues about it.  For example, it can be tools such as the ‚Äúshare with friends‚Äù or ‚Äúask friends‚Äù buttons on social networks. <br><br><h5>  Work with the media </h5><br><br>  The important point is the availability of the full ‚Äúpress kit‚Äù of the application, as well as its free version for bloggers and journalists, who will also create good free advertising for you, giving information about your application to publicity.  A good press kit should contain: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ application logo and developer; <br>  ‚Ä¢ screenshots; <br>  ‚Ä¢ detailed description; <br>  ‚Ä¢ features of your application (its competitive difference); <br>  ‚Ä¢ art drawings (most often used in the development of games - the main artistic concept). <br><br>  In addition, the publication of articles on thematic portals, where the final consumer will see them with a greater likelihood, may be very useful for you. <br><br>  So-called ‚Äúlet-players‚Äù also work as an excellent tool for advertising games - people recording and commenting on the game passing process, describing the essence and details of the game, and publishing them on their channels. <br><br><h5>  Work with reviews and ratings </h5><br><br>  Directly working with reviews at the moment is only possible on Google Play, but unfortunately, this functionality is often ignored by most publishers.  But there are also a number of techniques that allow you to work directly with these indicators: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Sowing grades.  For example, a pop-up window asking you to evaluate applications with only two options: ‚Äúevaluate by 5‚Äù and ‚Äúestimate by 1-4‚Äù; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to leave reviews within the application and implement their seeding; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ ‚ÄúCheat‚Äù ratings.  A number of services, including ours, offer an order of positive ratings to the application. <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Barter with the user, that is, some kind of mutually beneficial cooperation.  For example, an offer to the user to receive a bonus in the application for a positive assessment. <br><br><h5>  Email and Push Notifications </h5><br>  Email distribution is today one of the most effective and cheap means of returning a user to an application.  The main problem here is precisely to obtain the user's email address, because this is a kind of invasion of privacy, which often causes negative consumers.  The best way to obtain customer data is a barter system with the user in any form. <br><br>  We have identified two basic rules for push and email notifications: <br>  1. Perhaps a maximum of one notice per day; <br>  2. Notifications are allowed to be sent only in the daytime until 21:00, taking into account the time zone of the consumer. <br><br>  All notifications are a kind of spam, and not every application can afford to consistently ‚Äúspam‚Äù the consumer without the risk of being removed.  For example, if your product is a tool for communication between users (social networks, pagers), you can send push notifications that a message has arrived to the user without the risk of being considered a ‚Äúspam‚Äù application. <br><br>  We continue to collect questions that you are most interested in working with the promotion of mobile applications.  Leave your questions on <a href="http://top4app.com/contacts">our website</a> and our experts will promptly answer you. <br>  Regards, the team <a href="http://top4app.com/">top4app.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223071/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223071/</a></p>
