    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>Purple cow.</b>  <b>Make your business outstanding!</b>  <b>(Seth Godin)</b> <br>  Plus his ‚ÄúBootstrapper's Bible‚Äù is two motivating books that became legends in startup circles and were repeatedly mentioned in Habr√©.  The purple cow explains the basics of marketing in a simple and lively language, and the Bible dispels a bunch of myths that start-up entrepreneurs have.  The first seemed to me a pleasant reading on the road, the second - a very useful thing, which I highly recommend to you. <br><br>  <b>And nerds are doing business (Maxim Kotin)</b> <br>  We waited for this book with the whole company - and we were not mistaken.  It reads like an exciting detective story, from the first pages immediately tells about the realities of business in the regions.  Unlike many success stories, it ends in ruin, but it teaches very well.  Delivers the realities of Russian business at times better than the manuals. <br><br>  <b>The look of the book.</b>  <b>Selected articles on book design and typography (Jan Chihold)</b> <br>  A book about interfaces and typography from the last century, more relevant than ever.  Now we have as much visual garbage in the network and print as it was in Germany after the revolution.  The book helps to understand how to convey information quickly and correctly.  Very good for those who are ready to pass the old knowledge to the present.  He gave one such to the production workers - in a month the level of layout increased noticeably, plus the time for explaining ‚Äúwhy so‚Äù was reduced by four times. <br><br>  <b>Buyology: A fascinating journey into the brain of the modern consumer</b> <br>  About modern usability tests, and, more precisely, the removal of signals of brain activity from people watching different ads.  Interesting and the process itself, and the results.  If usability is not an empty sound for you, take it.  By the way, at the time of writing the book, technology was almost fiction, and now there are already in several usability laboratories in Russia. <br><br>  <b>A startup without a budget (Mike Michalowitz)</b> <br>  The book disguised as Rework.  A positive thing, full of examples and useful tips.  ‚ÄúAt twenty-seven, he perfectly managed the company, and you perfectly opened the beer bottles.‚Äù  There are a couple of good ideas - to read, write out and give a book to someone. <br><br>  <b>Contextual advertising (A. Babayev, N. Evdokimov, A. Ivanov)</b> <br>  It is surprisingly sound, though not without distortions, a textbook on the organization of contextual advertising.  If you read the blog of the same name on Habr√© and understand everything, then you don‚Äôt need it and it‚Äôs even harmful, but if you want everything and immediately in paper - take it.  Just remember that this knowledge is quickly becoming obsolete. <br><br>  <b>Have a serious conversation.</b>  <b>What and how to say when the stakes are high.</b>  <b>Joseph Granny, Al Switzler, Kerry Patterson, Ron Macmillan</b> and one more - <b>‚ÄúI hear you through and through.</b>  <b>Effective technology of negotiations "Mark Goulston</b> - two things that help control the negotiations and well complement the already mentioned in the first topic," You can agree on everything. "  Understandably, absolutely dead without practice. <br><br>  <b>Deadline: a novel about project management (DeMarco)</b> <br>  Simple and somewhat banal things about the standard rake of project management in a very beautiful wrapper of the ‚Äúmagic country‚Äù.  Actually, there is even a plot, which is very good.  At least it's worth scrolling. <br><br>  <b>Lifetime Customers (Carl Sewell, Paul Brown)</b> <br>  The book is about the client service, in which the leaders of the American auto service network share how things should work.  Chewed in sufficient detail, there are examples of how this or that action brings practical commercial benefits, good binding to the practice.  The book will definitely give you a couple of ideas <br><br>  <b>The best service is the lack of service.</b>  <b>How to save the client from the need for maintenance and save the company money (Bill Price, David Jaffe).</b> <b><br></b>  Those who prefer numbers and graphics instead of examples and opinions of real people.  It is a bit dry, but it conveys several important things, for example, about how to build key parameters for evaluating a service. <br><br>  <b>Do not growl at the dog!</b>  <b>The book is about the training of people, animals and himself (Karen Pryor)</b> <br>  This book was advised to me by a senior seller of one of the stores, in order to explain the essence of how he managed to build a workflow, practically from scratch.  I once read it, but the second time I re-read it as a new one: many things are so obvious and banal that they were simply forgotten.  I recommend everyone, regardless of the type of activity: really helps to understand relationships with people. <br><br>  <b>How to become a sales wizard (D. Fox)</b> <br>  And other books by Jeffrey Fox are wonderful poems from very useful things.  They look not very presentable due to the small format, but they are very encouraging to those who really need to learn quickly.  One of mine went for a walk around the office for two months. <br><br>  <b>Sell ‚Äã‚Äãyour idea!</b>  <b>How to profitably present your creative ideas to the boss, clients and other people.</b>  <b>(Sam Harrison)</b> <br>  In my opinion, a book with this title had no chance of being good.  Nevertheless, someone on Habr√© recommended it to me - and suddenly it turned out that she was very interesting.  Now I recommend it to you.  It is about how to bring your picture of the world to interlocutors who make decisions. <br><br>  <b>Fooled by randomness.</b>  <b>The Hidden Role of Chance in the Markets and in Life (Nassim Nicholas Taleb)</b> <br>  The second part of the book is about chance and how it works.  It turned out so cool that I recommend it even separately from the ‚ÄúBlack Swan‚Äù.  Dispels a lot of stereotypical opinions. <br><br>  <b>The path to financial freedom (Bodo Schaefer)</b> <br>  For those who prefer stability and a somewhat conservative approach to financial management.  ‚ÄúThe richest man in Babylon‚Äù is about the same, but in a lighter and ‚Äúplot‚Äù form. <br><br>  <b>The second oldest (Valery Agranovsky)</b> <br>  A very detailed book on journalism, written by one of the leading lights.  It is old enough, but at the same time it perfectly teaches to express thoughts, to receive and process information, and from different points of view. <br><br>  <b>The Art of Speech at the Court (P. Sergeich)</b> <br>  Pre-revolutionary book, telling about how a lawyer should act.  Just an amazing thing: here and hundreds of criminal cases examining the nineteenth century with the recommendations of a lawyer, and tips on speaking, and in general a lot of useful things.  Reads easily and like a novel, highly recommended on the road. <br><br>  <b>Don't make me think (Stephen Krug)</b> <br>  The second after "Mental Hospital for Patients" by utility in terms of increasing conversion from advertising and websites.  It is interesting that if the book about lawyers from the beginning of the twentieth century is still relevant, this one is already outdated: only general principles are preserved, but not solutions.  Still useful. <br><br>  <b>Cultural code.</b>  <b>How we live, what we buy and why (Kloter Rapai)</b> <br>  Very beautifully written and completely useless in ordinary practice book (well, if you do not trade around the world).  Nevertheless, from there you can draw a lot of ideas to understand how everything works.  The example with Nestle is especially beautiful: the Japanese simply did not want to drink coffee, because this taste is not in the culture.  The company began selling coffee with a taste of coffee and raised a new generation of children who have loved this taste since childhood. <br><br><h4>  How were the books sorted? </h4><br>  Corporate Library of Mosigra: a pair of hefty cabinets with useful books that can be taken and read.  They are used for free training of personnel (came - took) and then when we do not know how to do something and want to read how others stepped on this rake.  It is clear that in the books there is a lot of water and just a pity for the time, so we need assembly tips. <br><br><h4>  Crowdbooks </h4><br>  One more thing: I again ask you to <b>distribute interesting and useful books in the comments</b> that really help in business or related fields.  I will raise the name in the topic. <br><br><h4>  Books from the comments </h4><br>  Sterhel <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/141804/">added</a> Koni A.F. ‚ÄúLitigation‚Äù and ‚ÄúContrary to absurdity.  How I conquered Russia, and she conquered me ‚ÄùLennart Dahlgren, Butteff <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/141804/">advises</a> ‚Äú Time Drive: the art of time to live and work ‚Äùof Archangel, and Rednaxi <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/141804/">mentions</a> ‚Äú Manager in one minute ‚Äù,‚Äú Hot fans ‚Äùand other books of Kenneth Blanchard, SageScs <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mosigra/blog/141804/">remembered</a> about autobiography ‚ÄúRichard F.

At the first, by the way, I also asked not to do this, but as a result he scored a little less than eight hundred bookmarks. <br><br><h4>  The most pleasant </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c5/049/e7a/9c5049e7a04920457a3c1cbf7fe5ed63.jpg" align="left">  80% of these books are available online, so you can start downloading and reading right now.
