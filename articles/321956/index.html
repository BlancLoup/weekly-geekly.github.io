Arbitrage often gets advertisers' offers from affiliate networks. <br><br>  Affiliate networks are aggregators that link the barmans to advertisers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Functions of the affiliate network: </h2><br><ul><li>  Takes on the risks of working with advertisers and provides a convenient cash flow to arbitrageurs.  It is important for the arbitrator to quickly wrap money, and the advertiser does not always pay on time.  Affiliate network provides fast and timely payments. </li><li>  Communicates with arbitrazhniki, monitors the requirements of advertisers and receives feedback from them. </li><li>  Being a technological platform provides the arbitrator with convenient statistics and reports on conversions and leads. </li></ul><br>  Perhaps you have a question: "Why do we need a partner network?".  Its functions are not required, and key players: those who attract traffic and those who have a product for advertising. <br><br>  You can work directly with the advertiser, there are many such webmasters.  Usually these are arbitragers who have long been on the market or large arbitrage teams.  Plus, the obvious one is that the arbitrator receives more profit from the conversion, since advertisers pay him directly, and there is no intermediary who takes over part of the commission. <br><br>  But besides this advantage, there are quite a few disadvantages in direct work with advertisers. <br><br><h2>  Why working directly with the advertiser is not profitable </h2><br>  <b>Financial risks</b> : the advertiser makes payments in parts and not always on time: usually there are conditions net 30, net 60, when traffic is paid in a month or two after the conversion has happened.  Not every arbitrator is willing to bear financial risks.  The affiliate network provides quick money turnover and pays them weekly or every two weeks, sometimes pays every day. <br><br>  <b>It‚Äôs hard to close the advertiser‚Äôs entire budget alone</b> .  Advertiser is profitable to work with large players who can completely pour out the budget that was planned.  When you work alone, this is problematic.  The partner network easily copes with this task, since it has more human resources at its disposal. <br><br>  <b>Advertisers are not always pleasant and easy business partners</b> .  The partner network is interested in maintaining good relations with the arbitrators, who form the basis of the company's business.  The affiliate network has specially trained people, affiliate managers (affiliate manager) and account managers (account manager).  Their task is to communicate with the advertiser: providing reports on the quality of traffic and used creatives.  The arbitrator has no time to communicate with the advertiser, his priority task is to attract traffic. <br><br>  <b>More responsibility</b> : you subscribe to certain conditions, and the advertiser waits for them.  When you work with an affiliate network, you work with one offer, if it didn‚Äôt work: you didn‚Äôt promoter the campaigns or change your mind to work with this offer, you change the offer.  For the affiliate network, this is not a problem: the traffic on this offer does not disappear, it is passed to another artist. <br><br>  <b>More legal formalities</b> : all advertisers are big businesses.  Working with them requires the signing of documents, imposes special restrictions on the financial relations between the participants.  The affiliate network works on flexible terms with webmasters and arbitrazhnik, it is always possible to agree with it. <br><br><h2>  The difference between partner networks from each other </h2><br>  Let's talk about the difference between partner networks from each other.  How to choose those partners with whom you should work and which should be avoided. <br><br>  Partner networks are divided according to different parameters, we will try to understand them. <br><br>  <b>Verticals and types of offers you work with</b> .  There are mobile partner networks, for example, Mobio Network.  We work with different verticals of mobile offers and applications.  We know a lot of advertisers in the mobile Russian market.  There are partner networks that work only with vertical dating or only with commodity offers. <br><br>  <b>The presence of direct offers</b> .  There are affiliate networks with direct exclusive offers from advertisers.  There are partner networks that work with the advertiser not directly, but through other affiliate programs.  Offers that they give are called intercompany.  The main profit of working with grids with direct offers is big payouts: the advertiser pays them more, they take a commission, and you will get a certain part of it.  If the offer passes a chain of intermediaries, the profit is less. <br><br>  The affiliate network, if it works with reseller offers, does not control and does not affect the advertiser when there is a risk of not paying or questions about the quality of the traffic.  This affiliate program does not communicate directly with the advertiser.  The affiliate network does not always say whether you offer a direct offer or a direct link: check the link and see which path is clicked using <a href="http://redirectdetective.com/">Redirect Detective</a> or Live HTTP headers + VPN.  Knowing certain domains, you will see: whether the offer came from an advertiser or from another affiliate grid. <br><br>  <b>Having account managers who communicate with advertisers</b> .  The more direct advertisers, the more account managers should provide quality support.  Everything is interconnected: the better the support, the more direct offers, better payouts, more budgets, better conditions for the offers. <br><br>  If the affiliate network does not have accounts, the conditions on the offers will be worse.  When there are account managers, there is always feedback from the advertiser.  You are openly discussing: your traffic, whether it is possible to get a big bid, big payouts depending on the targeting parameters.  You can ask about the quality of traffic in general, how much real purchases and monetization of traffic cost, and so on.  Less risk of financial reductions and fines from the advertiser - the account manager settles all the irregularities. <br><br>  <b>Affiliate managers</b> are people who communicate with partners, webmasters and arbitrators.  The quality of affiliate managers of an affiliate network distinguishes a good affiliate network from a bad one.  An experienced affiliate manager will tell you a good offer, traffic sources, bundles, show how that bundle starts at a particular traffic source.  You can discuss individual payments and conditions with it.  When there are no such affiliate managers, it‚Äôs more difficult to work with affiliate networks. <br><br>  <b>Sales managers</b> are people who find direct advertisers and lead direct exclusive offers with the best payouts.  The more sales managers - the more offers - it is more profitable to work. <br><br>  <b>Payments and billing</b> .  The partner network assumes the function of settling financial issues and reducing risks.  The advertiser does not always pay on time.  Affiliate network pays arbitragers more often. <br><br>  Affiliate net, if necessary, credits turnover to the advertising office in the advertising network.  The most convenient conditions: daily or weekly payments.  Some kind of affiliate networks give financial bonuses, discounts on the completion of advertising offices. <br><br>  <b>Tracking system and technology</b> .  Partner networks work on various engines, there are well-known, on which the majority works: <a href="http://www.hasoffers.com/">Hasoffers</a> or <a href="https://affise.com/">Affise</a> .  There are partner networks with self-written systems.  The system directly affects the usability, the main indicators: interface and tracking.  Tracking affects CR. <br><br>  Remember, any tracking system can not play by the rules.  There are such concepts as shaves and fraud, when the affiliate network does not pay you for the installations that you have brought. <br><br>  Setting antifraud systems depends on the tracking system, and the presence of an antifraud system affects CR.  The same offer in different affiliate programs may behave differently: in one you will receive 10 leads for 100 clicks, and in the other 8 leads.  It is more profitable for you to work with the one where your CR is higher. <br><br>  We already talked more about <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mobio/blog/314896/">antifraud systems</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/mobio/blog/317496/">tracking systems</a> . <br><br><h2>  Who to work with? </h2><br>  In order to decide who to work with, follow these steps: <br><br>  <b>Analyze the media space</b> .  Look at the forums, in public, on different Internet portals, what they write about the affiliate network.  What the representatives of the network write: how professional and logical this is. <br><br>  Ask around with friends, other arbitrageurs, if they had any problems working with partner networks.  It is very important whether the affiliate network has a blog, and what information they share on social networks.  The more information about the affiliate network, the easier it is to understand how safe it is to work with it. <br><br>  There are various services: <a href="http://odigger.com/">oDigger</a> or <a href="https://www.offervault.com/">OfferVault</a> , in which you can search for one or another offer, see the conditions for it in different partner networks.  There are also reviews on working with affiliates, read what they write about these or other partner networks. <br><br>  <b>Use monitoring services</b> .  There are various advertising monitoring services, which we will talk about later.  In Russia: <a href="https://admobispy.com/">AdMobiSpy</a> and <a href="https://publer.wildo.ru/">Publer</a> , the world has a service like <a href="https://adplexity.com/">Adplexity</a> , it monitors ad networks and searches for affiliate links. <br><br>  You can see which affiliate links are more - it means more arbitrators work with these networks.  Through monitoring services, you will appreciate how large the affiliate network is and what its share in the arbitration market is. <br><br>  <b>Work with large networks</b> .  If the network is large, you have less financial risk, since they have turnover, you will not get into a situation when the partner network cannot pay you, because they ran out of money.  A large affiliate network values ‚Äã‚Äãits reputation and will avoid all sorts of conflicts and problems and does not use dishonest methods of cooperation.  Large direct advertisers work with large networks - more direct offers, payouts and better conditions. <br><br>  <b>Work with 3-5 grids</b> .  You should not work with a large number of partner networks, just as you do not need to keep everything in one basket and rely on relationships with one partner.  There may be a conflict or any problem and it is better to always have a backup option. <br><br>  Test the same offer in several partner networks.  In different partner networks, one offer may have a different CR and, depending on this, it may be beneficial for you to work with one or another partner network.  You may have different payments on this offer in different partner networks, but depending on the fact that CR is different, it may turn out that it is more profitable for you to work with the one that has less payments. <br><br>  On the other hand, do not work with a very large number of affiliate networks.  It freezes the workflow and creates a bunch of chats in which you need to communicate with affiliate managers.  You will have a lot of operational tasks to which you devote yourself, instead of engaging in traffic. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  In this block we examined what partner networks are, how to work with them, and how they differ from each other.  In the next lesson we will discuss traffic sources and advertising formats. <br><br>  You can ask any questions about arbitration in the comments or in <a href="https://vk.com/mobionetwork">our VKontakte group</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321956/</a></p>
