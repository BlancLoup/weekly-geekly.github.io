What did the team of the new generation financial institution project do for the past three weeks and what are the nearest plans for Polybius in this article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c40/7da/e51/c407dae51a2a433b87de9c4502b1742a.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Completed cases </h3><br>  Immediately after the ICO was closed, all unnecessary tokens were burned.  Of the 20 million PLBTs initially emitted, there are just a little less than four left: 3,969,565. It's a shame, of course, that they did not reach the round number.

      The next few days, the team accepted the last bank payments and charged them with tokens. <br><br>  In this case, all payments received are still in their accounts, <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/13M2aBStru4LDoUGtqKbpvo3hdF4B8Rg8F">anyone</a> can be sure of the contents of the wallets of <a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xe9eca8bb5e61e8e32f26b5e8c117561f68084a9c">Ethereum</a> , <a href="https://emercoin.mintr.org/address/EeLeckKqTRvbbyThGhvMYeVWhrCwYb6ev6">Emercoin</a> and our <a href="https://blockchain.info/address/13M2aBStru4LDoUGtqKbpvo3hdF4B8Rg8F">bitcoin escrow Coinbase</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  What happens now </h3><br>  The distribution of PLBT tokens is being completed as part of a bounty campaign.  In total, 79,391.299966 (2% of the total) PLBT tokens are allocated as a bonus for various forms of project support and sales of ICO Polybius. <br><br>  There is an internal audit of the ICO, during which our accountants reconcile accrued tokens with the received money to verify the ideal order of all operations, since, having collected more than $ 30 million in this fiscal year, Polybius Foundation, according to Estonian law, will have to undergo an obligatory accounting audit the beginning of 2018. <br><br><h3>  Hunting, Will Hunting: Where Polybius Bank Will Take Bankers </h3><br>  The future Polybius bank is already a popular place to work.  Bankers, lawyers, experts in the field of security and cryptography actively send us their resumes. <br><br>  But question number 1 for the Polybius team now is precisely the recruitment of a strong banking team.  Why is this so important? <br><br><ul><li>  To establish a bank - you need to get a license. </li><li>  To get a license - you need to dial a cool team. </li><li>  To recruit a cool team - you need to lure them from their current jobs. </li></ul><br>  And here the fun begins. <br><br>  In the course of the ICO, we were often reproached for not seeing experienced and successful bankers in the project.  This is only half true: it is clear that they were not there, but not because of their absence. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9b/704/1ad/a9b7041ad26afb265a49016585315133.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <font color="#808080"><em>See the banker?</em></font>  <font color="#808080"><em>And he is</em></font> <br><br>  Hunting Bank "Polybius" began long before the start of the ICO.  Of course, there was nowhere else to hire bankers - but this did not prevent us from meeting high-level specialists interested in the project, many of whom confirmed their readiness to go to work at Polybius in the event of ICO's success. <br><br>  Now that ICO Polybius has not only fulfilled, but exceeded, the collection plan, the bankers ‚Äôexodus process from the mighty but unwieldy institutions of the old type has begun.  However, this process alone takes from one to six months: bankers are not the people who change jobs at the click.  Someone needs to work on the contract month, someone two, someone six. <br><br>  Now there is a hunting process - lawyers communicate, they make employment contracts.  The formation of a bank team will begin at the top: first, the CEO and the bank management, who make the main strategic decisions, formulate the basic parameters of development - and then recruit the necessary staff. <br><br>  Such decisions will include the final <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/polybius/blog/288098/">choice of the country of jurisdiction</a> of the Polybius Bank and agreements with regulators, as well as the decision to obtain a banking license from scratch or through the purchase of a ready-made bank. <br><br>  We consider buying a finished bank as a backup option for obtaining a banking license.  Similar proposals began to arrive to us even before the completion of the ICO - in particular, we are now studying one Maltese bank.  It is important to understand that when you buy a ready-made bank, you buy its entire history - therefore, such a purchase requires the most thorough verification.  In particular, therefore, we prefer to start from scratch, creating your bank. <br><br>  We are planning to announce the name of the first CEO of Polybius Bank already this fall, then the following key names will become known - and the team of Polybius Bank (without a bank so far) will begin its work. <br><br><h3>  Why not be afraid of falling tokens </h3><br>  Immediately after the release of the Polybius token on the stock exchange on July 5, its price began to plummet, reaching $ 3.6 at the lowest point with a $ 10 starting denomination.  However, the simplest analysis shows that the situation has nothing to do with ‚Äúinvestors in panic merge tokens for any money‚Äù.  With a total capitalization of Polybius tokens ~ $ 18 million <a href="https://ru.cryptonator.com/rates/PLBT-USD">at the current rate</a> , the volume of trades on PLBT is kept at <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/assets/polybius/">$ 100-150 thousand per day</a> - this is less than a percentage of the total mass of tokens.  What is this percentage?  Most likely, it is traded tokens paid as bounty (ie, free). <br><br>  Accordingly, the investors who paid out real money for PLBT, as we can see, did not succumb to panic and herd feelings, realizing that investing like ‚ÄúPolybius‚Äù is a long-term investment, therefore 99% of tokens remain in the wallets of their original purchasers.  The rate of the token has already begun to grow little by little, will probably grow after this publication - and will inevitably continue to grow as the next news of Polybius Bank. <br><br><h3>  Cool, you got on TV </h3><br>  Of course, the addresses of HashCoins and Polybius are now overwhelmed with various requests for assistance in organizing ICO - we definitely cannot answer all of them on the merits, it is unlikely that we will even be able to read everything in its entirety.  We have to select the most interesting. <br><br>  For example, after the hype made by ICO Polybius (do not forget that ICO was conducted by an Estonian company, and across Estonia a crowdfunding campaign with more than $ 30 million was a bomb), we started writing Estonian bank managers inviting the HashCoins team to give lectures on blockchain and cryptocurrency.  We have already started going to them, sharing our experience with pleasure and for free.  If you represent a European or large Russian bank, then you can also invite us to speak to you by writing to <a href="">info@hashcoins.com</a> .  Let's be friends banks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c65/baa/e43/c65baae43e27a84d1b549aa0146967cb.gif" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370681/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370681/</a></p>
