Users often connect to corporate IT infrastructure from mobile devices through public hot spots, which entails certain security risks.  Therefore, companies are forced to apply additional protective measures: redundancy, load balancing, encryption.  Software-defined networks help solve these problems.

      One of the most significant events of the day was the review of the VeloCloud network SD-WAN solution.  VeloCloud is a provider of cloud-defined, distributed networks acquired by VMware <a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/3235963/vmware-acquires-velocloud-what-will-this-mean-for-sd-wan.html">last year</a> .  The organization offers a custom solution that automatically routes, encapsulates, monitors and restricts traffic. <br><br>  The system includes a software platform and devices installed along the perimeter of the corporate network (in the branches of companies, data centers, etc.).  In the latter case, we are talking about VeloCloud Edge hardware.  They allow you to build tunnels of various types: Branch-to-Branch, Branch to SaaS, Branch to DC, there is also support for legacy-networks through IPsec. <br><br>  The system analyzes the type of transmitted packets and the performance of network channels.  Based on these data, the most appropriate channel is dynamically selected or a decision is made to aggregate several of them.  VeloCloud SD-WAN separates the control and transmission levels, which are responsible for the logic of the network devices and the traffic broadcast.  This approach makes the network more productive and flexible. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúForget about jitter - it will be no more‚Äù, - Guido Roberto Frabotti, Lead Engineer of SD-WAN in VMware</i> </blockquote><br>  The capabilities of SD-WAN by VeloCloud are impressive - during the tests, the system reduced the average ping by three times and solved the problem of packet loss during a UDP connection via LTE.  Representatives of VMware claim that you can now forget about the defects in voice and video communication, if at least one channel (LTE or Fiber Channel) has sufficient bandwidth. <br><br>  The work of the solution in the production environment has already been evaluated by large organizations.  For example, in February of this year, the SD-WAN by VeloCloud system was <a href="https://techblog.comsoc.org/2019/02/10/sp-telecom-deploys-velocloud-vmwares-sd-wan-technology-in-singapore/">introduced</a> in Singapore Telecommunications Company SP Telecom.  It successfully routes traffic on a network connected to more than one hundred data centers and commercial buildings connected by a million kilometers of optical fiber.  SD-WAN users also include <a href="https://www.velocloud.com/customers/case-study-redmond">Redmond</a> , <a href="https://www.velocloud.com/customers/case-study-deutsche-telekom">Deutsche Telekom</a> and <a href="https://www.velocloud.com/customers/case-study-triton">Triton</a> . <br><br><h2>  IoT on the pulse </h2><br>  The company actively joins the growing segment of corporate IoT.  In this area, VMware has the following goals: <br><br><ul><li>  Simplify the management of individual smart devices and their clusters due to centralized administration, customizable templates, detailed and timely information about failures (and not only). </li><li>  Increase the security of IoT infrastructure, especially at critical corporate sites.  As examples, the speakers cited the experience of VMware with railway companies and medical institutions. </li><li>  Allow partner companies to implement a flexible and scalable infrastructure without the need to involve specialized administrators. </li><li>  Implement native integration with various types of cloud environments. </li></ul><br>  The company will try to achieve all these goals using its IoT infrastructure management platform - Pulse 2.0.  It is a solution for monitoring, administering and protecting Internet of Things devices.  The purpose of Pulse is to simplify the management of large-scale IoT-based infrastructure through a RESTful API and more advanced update procedures ‚Äúover the air‚Äù. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúIt is capable of supporting work with 100 million smart devices.‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  The demonstration of product features impressed us.  Representatives of the IT giant clearly showed that now the configuration and mass update of smart devices can be done in a couple of clicks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hp/wh/pg/hpwhpglvtpjx0s7v8v-qffbdssc.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Newly machine learning </h2><br>  Like the <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/it-grad/blog/452840/">first day</a> , machine learning was a hot topic.  VMware told that they annually double investments in MO technologies.  Intelligent algorithms are already performing a number of routine operations in such products as vSAN, NSX-T, vRealize Operations &amp; Log Insight, Wavefront Analytics, Apteligent, Skyline. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúAI systems analyze logs and infrastructure performance, provide reports and recommendations to administrators, balance server load and even partially automate technical support.‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  Automation of data centers is one of the priorities of VMware.  Representatives of the company are convinced that a ‚Äúlive‚Äù administrator should deal only with defining the policies of the data center, and their implementation should lie entirely on the shoulders of the artificial intelligence system.  In particular, VMware plans to implement a smart firewall, which will take on many of the tasks of full-time network administrators. <br><br>  The second day of the VMware EMPOWER 2019 conference was no less eventful than the first.  We will continue to talk about the latest technological innovations of the IT giant in the blog on Habr√© and in the <a href="https://teleg.run/iaasblog">Telegram channel</a> , where we broadcast from the scene. <br><br><hr><br>  <i>Posts from the Telegram channel with VMware EMPOWER 2019 news:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://teleg.run/iaasblog/230">About the possibilities of the updated NSX-T 2.4</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://teleg.run/iaasblog/229">Storage Virtualization Reaches New Level</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://teleg.run/iaasblog/227">Online Revolution: SD-WAN by VeloCloud</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://teleg.run/iaasblog/226">IoT - Pulse is palpable</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453096/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453096/</a></p>
