    <h4>  What is there?  Is there life there?  And what miracles can be on these countless worlds? <br></h4><br>  Of course, the only way to go there and find out is to move through space-time to these distant stars, planets, nebulae, and even GALAXIES. <br><br>  But alas and ah - the time is not that.  The only thing that our technology moved to reach is not far beyond the solar system, thanks to the automatic probes of the Voyager project, of which <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216445/">Voyager-1</a> was launched in 1977! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b05/f14/a10/b05f14a10d9a3e594bd3412f3e8ea435.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But in order to seriously talk about other worlds, we need a speed at least equal to the speed of light, and ideally superluminal. <br><br>  What prevents? <br><br>  <b>It's all simple - all the laws of physics, and the fundamental ones.</b> <br><br><h3>  Law of causality </h3><br>  The bottom line is that the investigation cannot outrun the cause.  No one ever watched, for example, first a duck fell dead and then a hunter fired.  At speeds exceeding C, the sequence of events becomes reverse, the tape of time is rewound back.  This is easily seen from the following simple argument. <br><br>  <i>Suppose that we are on a certain spacecraft moving faster than light.</i>  <i>Then we would gradually catch up with the light emitted by the source at increasingly earlier times.</i>  <i>At first we would catch up with photons emitted, say, yesterday, then emitted the day before yesterday, then a week, a month, a year ago, and so on.</i>  <i>If the light source were a mirror reflecting life, we would first see the events of yesterday, then the day before yesterday, and so on.</i>  <i>We could see, say, an old man who gradually turns into a middle-aged man, then a young man, a young man, a child ... That is, time would be reversed, we would move from the present to the past.</i>  <i>Cause and effect would be swapped.</i> <br><br><h3>  Albert Limitations </h3><br>  <a href="https://naked-science.ru/article/nakedscience/einsteins-special-relativity">(Special theory of relativity)</a> <br><br>  In addition to the problem of causality, nature has set even more stringent conditions: motion is unattainable not only at superluminal speed, but also at a speed equal to the speed of light ‚Äî it can only be <b>approached</b> .  It follows from the theory of relativity that as <b>the speed of</b> movement <b>increases</b> , three circumstances arise: the <b>mass of a</b> moving object <b>increases</b> , its size decreases in the direction of motion, and the <b>flow of time</b> on this object <b>slows down</b> (from the point of view of an external ‚Äúquiescent‚Äù observer).  At normal speeds, these changes are insignificantly small, but as they approach the speed of light, they become more noticeable, and in the limit - at a speed equal to C - the mass becomes <b>infinitely large</b> , the object loses its size in the direction of motion and <b>time</b> <b>stops</b> on it.  Therefore, no material body can reach the speed of light.  Only the light itself has this speed!  (At the near-light speed, the "all-pervasive" particle is moving - the neutrino) <br><br>  <i>In general, apart from the many problems described above, for example, at near-light speed, when an object weighing 1 kg collides with a grain of sand, such an amount of energy is released that allows 10 thousand tons of steel to be turned into steam in 1 second.</i>  <i>If we compare this with the real mass of the starship, the power of the explosion will be equal to or exceed the power of nuclear processes occurring on the Sun.</i> <br><br>  But the smart will not go uphill, the smart mountain will pass, because the laws are there to break them ... just kidding, you can't break laws, but science fiction (and near science) offers us ways of moving around the principles of SRT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e1/a47/69f/8e1a4769f83e5c43ec0ac274dfc0d3f1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Ways of superluminal movements in space-time </h3><br><h4>  Einstein-Rosen Bridges </h4><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D1%2588%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25E2%2580%2594_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">The bridges of Einstein-Rosen</a> , also known as wormholes or wormholes, are perhaps the most well-known means of interstellar travel ‚Äî and most likely actually exist.  The general theory of relativity of Albert Einstein predicted the existence of wormholes, although they have not yet been able to detect them. <br><br>  In simple terms, the Einstein-Rosen Bridge is a tunnel in space caused by the deformation of space-time.  Massive objects, such as stars or black holes, bend time and space, like a bowling ball bending a trampoline.  A sufficiently massive object can bend space-time so much that it creates a connection between two points that are sufficiently distant in the normal state. <br><br>  Imagine a piece of paper and two points on it.  You need to get from one point to another, and if you move strictly along the surface of the paper, this ‚Äújourney‚Äù will take some time.  However, if we fold the sheet so that the points coincide, and pierce it in this place with a pencil, then using a pencil like a tunnel (or bridge), we will significantly reduce the distance between the points. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15f/820/be7/15f820be75ce29d1098acbb7431ee682.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The entrance to the wormhole was often represented as an entrance to the tunnel, which makes sense given the name.  But this is a misconception.  In the film "Interstellar" this moment is shown correctly - from the point of view of the observer in a three-dimensional space the wormhole should look like a sphere. <br><br>  Wormholes are a tempting method for making interstellar motions because they do not require you to exceed the speed of light.  Physics tells us that nothing can move faster than light.  But with wormholes, you can overcome huge interstellar distances without breaking this law. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/91e/d4b/de9/91ed4bde9d640322ab5da15a0c2fcf55.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Warp engine </h3><br>  Warp, technology FTL, which at the moment has a <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/191568/">real chance to</a> be realized.  Warp can safely be called the most realistic way to move above the speed of light of all known.  Let it so far and remains only in the form of formulas on paper.  We are talking about the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2583%25D0%25B7%25D1%258B%25D1%2580%25D1%258C_%25D0%2590%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D1%258C%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5">engine Alcubierre</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5c/72f/cc4/f5c72fcc4754d54d2b45ee4398fbff3e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The principle of operation follows from the way around the Special Theory of Relativity, which postulates that nothing in space can move faster than the speed of light.  The ‚Äúpath‚Äù is that this postulate does not extend to the space itself, which can contract and stretch from various influences, for example, the gravitational field, the warp engine compresses the space in front of the ship and expands it behind the ship, moving the bubble of the usual space along with the ship forward . <br><br>  In the Star Trek universe, such engines develop speeds that are quite modest by science fiction standards - the Enterprise wanderings were limited to one sector of the galaxy near the Solar System (~ 1500 light years), took years and left a bunch of white spots and unexplored areas. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/683/4c8/a51/6834c8a513f7475c8c75faf07e492923.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Hyperspace </h2><br>  Not so long ago, detailed experimental <a href="http://xray.sai.msu.ru/~polar/sci_rev/131.html">data</a> from the WMAP spacecraft about the temperature inhomogeneities of the CMB, which is one of the main objects of observation in the study of our universe, appeared.  When analyzing these data, a large anomaly of the angular distribution of the background radiation fluctuations at low harmonics was found.  One explanation of this phenomenon was the theory that the topology of our universe is different from the three-dimensional plane or ball.  When considering the topology of our universe in the form of a dodecahedron, theoretical calculations closely agree with experimental data. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúA flat topologically complex three-dimensional Universe can be built only on the basis of cubes, parallelepipeds and hexagonal prisms.  In the case of curved space, a wider class of shapes has such properties.  At the same time, the angular spectra that are best obtained in the WMAP experiment are consistent with the model of the Universe having the form of a dodecahedron. ‚ÄùMikhail Prokhorov, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Leading Researcher, Department of Relativistic Astrophysics at the Sternberg State Astronomical Institute. </blockquote>  Thus, the possibility of the existence of a hyperspace of the Universe, in which our limited universe is present, is indicated by theories based on practical data on relic radiation.  However, even if the hyperspace exists, in order to move in this space you need some kind of special engine. <br><br>  <i>Imagine that there is a valley in front of you, and you need to get to the point behind the valley.</i>  <i>Since you can only move on a flat surface (in 2-dimensional space), you will either have to go around an obstacle or descend into the valley, cross it, and then climb.</i>  <i>But if at your disposal a plane that can move in 3-dimensional space, then you will reach where you need in a straight line.</i> <br><br>  In fact, the hyperspace has a metric that is different from the usual 3-dimensional space and the movement in it is similar to the movement in the wormhole, only the tunnels can connect not one but several points at once that extend into the usual 3-dimensional space.  Moreover, the movement itself in hyperspace will be visually different from the movement in the wormhole (contrary to common illustrations), since the three-dimensional structure of the universe will ‚Äúenvelop‚Äù the traveler inside the hyperspace path.  I think if this is possible, the spectacle is truly fascinating - visible stars, nebulae or whole galactic clusters - slowly creeping out and stretching, changing the color palette during the shift to the cosmological red zone (?). <br><br>  <i>The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhyperspace movement, in my opinion, was successfully filmed in the 1997 film ‚ÄúContact‚Äù.</i>  <i>(according to the novel by Karl Sagan, the film was awarded the Hugo Award. 2nd place in the list of the most reliable science fiction films according to NASA).</i>  <i>In it, the installation, the drawings of which were received by a signal from an extraterrestrial civilization caught by the heroine of the film, created manipulations with exotic energy and as a result ‚Äúlet through‚Äù the cockpit with a man through the internal space of the sphere.</i>  <i>Apparently, the cabin fell into hyperspace, into the already created ‚Äútunnel‚Äù.</i>  <i>As it turned out, there are a great many of these tunnels throughout the galaxy and they were all created by a more ancient civilization.</i>  <i>Well, this is according to the representative of the race, the signal of which was caught by the heroine of the film.</i>  <i>Taki case guys.</i>  <i>Personally, I have this movie in the top.</i>  <i>But as practice shows, not everyone likes it.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0a1/a9e/5aa/0a1a9e5aa166fbef28038428a366d772.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Unrealistic teleporting </h3><br>  We know that the most common explanation for teleportation is the instantaneous movement of a material object in space at an arbitrary distance. <br>  In this context, you can use the wormhole, but we have already talked about it, so let's talk about a fundamentally different way. <br><br>  And we are interested in teleportation of information about a substance, up to a quantum snapshot, of a state. <br><br>  The process is approximately the following: Your body places the installation in point A, which scans you down to subatomic particles and their quantum state, and then digitizes your copy.  After that, the quantum state is transmitted as a single stream via standard communication channels.  But there is a problem - a ban on superluminal data transmission, according to the SRT, on the other hand, if science proves the existence of hypothetical particles with negative or imaginary rest mass, such as tachyon, information about the object can be transmitted at superluminal speed.  And maybe even with the help of gravitational waves (?).  After that, in paragraph B, the person is recreated at the quantum level and voila - he is already at the destination.  The arguments about the "soul" destroyed in the installation And I omit, because I am an atheist and do not take it into account (weeds). <br><br>  This method is good in that for quantum teleportation of a material object it is not necessary to use the curvature of space-time and expend a huge amount of energy.  The problem is of course in the initial delivery of the installation itself, which will reproduce the object at point B. But it can be delivered in more lengthy ways, not limited to one or more human lives. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/103/0eb/b2e/1030ebb2e5f995c00a40abe72aa4d001.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Mass zeroing </h2><br>  All spaceships of the Mass Effect universe somehow use the Zero Element in one way or another, which generates the indicated Mass Effect, either lowering the mass of objects around it, or increasing it.  Thus, it is possible to turn the Theory of Relativity and exceed the speed of light. <br><br>  Ordinary travels between planets and nearby stars are made using FTL engines, which can only reduce the mass of the ship.  For interstellar long-haul flights, Mass Relays are used ‚Äî huge stations built around dense cores consisting of zero element.  Relays are usually tied to one or more other relays and are able to create a corridor in which the mass actually disappears, almost instantly transferring the ship to thousands of light years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f51/e5a/220/f51e5a220c4410e21750888108066007.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Closed timelike curves </h3><br>  The last form of superluminal movement, which we consider, at first glance seems to be the least scientific. <br><br>  For 55 years, the Doctor Who series has been telling about adventures in time and space of the Doctor and his / her human companions.  What means of transportation did they use?  A large blue box, known as the TARDIS (English TARDIS - Time and Relative Dimension in Space), which can move them to any place and any time they want. <br><br>  Constructed (or, rather, grown), by the ancient ‚ÄúTime Lords‚Äù race, the TARDIS are more magical than the Mass Effect technology.  As the Doctor himself explained, his vehicle is ‚Äúa wobbly-cotton temporary-time figovina.‚Äù  It seems that when moving in the TARDIS there is some kind of delay - that is, it is closer to the hyperdrive than to the teleportator.  But, in essence, the TARDIS disappears here, flies through the ‚Äútemporal whirlwind‚Äù and appears there.  That's all you really need to know. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ae/c96/c97/8aec96c972b37b2d4f585b25b5298e01.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Or not?  It turns out that the TARDIS has even more theoretical basis than hyperspace. <br><br>  In 2013, physicists Benjamin K. Tippett and David Tsang published a paper proposing the theoretical foundations of creating a real time machine, i.e.  ways to travel to your past.  The article was called <i>"Traversable Achnronal Retrograde Domains In Spacetime"</i> (check out the abbreviation). <br><br>  Tippett and Tsang describe a time traveler who is in a space-time bubble that enters a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2597%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BD%25D1%2583%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B2%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F">closed time-like curve</a> (essentially the same as the Einstein-Rosen bridge).  Within this curve, the traveler can go anywhere on his own timeline, while inside the bubble time seems to be proceeding normally. <br><br>  Two physicists have even suggested that timelike curves can be separated and connected, opening up the possibility of traveling not only on your own time scale, but also anywhere in time and space. <br><br>  Well, like all that I could offer you. <br><br>  Surely I missed something or even went over to the fantasy area.  So I wait in the comments for your version. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444244/</a></p>
