We need to take care of its development and attracting the target audience. <br><br>  I would like to immediately explain the difference between the "vile SEOs" and competent optimizers involved in the promotion of sites. <br><br>  For me, website promotion is the work of attracting the target audience to the website <b>and keeping it in place</b> for visitors to perform certain actions.

      Based on the second part of the definition, before inviting visitors to the site, you need to prepare it for their arrival and make the most convenient resource. <br><br>  The main task of preparation is to clearly convince the visitor that you are solving the problem with which the visitor came.  Relatively speaking, you can sell LCD TVs in different ways: you can simply provide a list of models with characteristics and let the buyer deal with it himself, and if you solve a problem called ‚Äúturnkey individual home theater,‚Äù pick the right equipment for your customer , equip him with cables and set up at home, and to the eyeballs give him a DVD with a new film - you solve his problem and increase your credibility. <br><br>  In short, the points of view on how the site should be - a lot: the programmer, the designer, the owner and others involved in this work have their own.  But we do it for people? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Client-oriented site VS usual </h4><br>  <b>Pros SDL (made for people) sites:</b> <br><ul><li>  Reducing the bounce rate (if the site sells no rebar, a reduction of 15-20% can be achieved), respectively - an increase in conversion; </li><li>  Increase visitor loyalty.  It's nice when they take care of you, especially if you are just wondering if you should buy something; </li><li>  Reducing the cost of promotion in the long term.  The cost of processing the site in the SDL usually pays off more than a year, but then ... </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><ul><li>  Time for revision (usually at least 3-4 weeks); </li><li>  As a rule, large one-time costs for refinement. </li></ul><br><h4>  Definition of results and goals of promotion </h4><br>  This is the most important thing for a successful project.  To know - why and for whom it all started. <br><br><h5>  We must know who will come to us (for whom, actually, the site was made) </h5><br>  If you produce dietary supplements, then most likely your main audience is women of 25-40 years old, however, you should take into account that they can buy not only for themselves, but also for their children, husbands, parents, therefore the materials on the site should contain information and for these consumers. <br><br>  If you sell furniture and your audience is final and wholesale customers, it makes sense to separate these two groups and materials for them, because  they are interested in slightly different information. <br><br>  Often, visitors are at different stages from making a purchase and they may also need different materials.  For those who are already familiar with the product - characteristics, for those who only make a choice - the advantages compared with analogues. <br><br>  But you should know the maximum about your audience.  An example from my field: the best clients for website promotion are medium and small businesses, because  they work in a competitive environment, which means they are more mobile and ready to change under market conditions.  In addition, feedback is better with them. <br><br>  <b>Why all this: allows you to identify materials that interest visitors.</b> <br><h5>  We must clearly define what actions each target group must take. </h5><br>  As a rule, the goal is to display a specific page.  Although many keep track of calls from customers who come from the site. <br><br>  Goals can be: <br><ul><li>  Subscribe to a newsletter (‚Äúthanks, you are on the mailing list‚Äù); </li><li>  Making a purchase in the online store (‚Äúthanks for paying for the order‚Äù); </li><li>  Sending an order through the form ("Thank you, your application will be processed within 24 hours"); </li><li>  Making a call ("thanks for the call, how did you hear about us"). </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Why: this will determine the structure and navigation of the site.</b> <br><h5>  Key performance indicators </h5><br>  This is the main result: <br><ul><li>  Number of subscribers; </li><li>  Number of buyers, average purchase price, repeat orders, bounce rate; </li><li>  Number of calls; </li><li>  Number of completed applications </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Why: it will allow to focus on the result - real, not speculative, and most importantly - to understand at what stages customers have problems when communicating with the site.</b> <br><h5>  Analysis of the technical component </h5><br>  These, as many habrachiteli know, include: <br><ul><li>  Page loading speed </li><li>  Validation, cross-browser compatibility </li><li>  Page size and download speed </li><li>  Presence favicon </li><li>  Readability code </li><li>  PE Urly </li><li>  Presence of styles and java in page codes </li><li>  Page 404 </li><li>  Robots.txt file </li><li>  Viruses </li><li>  Mirrors </li><li>  Afilliate </li><li>  Indexing </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Why: allows you to find bottlenecks in the program part of the site, which may hinder promotion.</b> <br><h5>  What is the result </h5><br>  When we have a list of target groups and actions we need, we will be able to determine what information and in what form they need, as well as the structure and navigation (link pages and the sequence of their display to the visitor) of the site. <br><br>  When we have a list of key promotion performance indicators, we will understand what kind of visitor statistics data we need, as well as what information we need to clarify with customers and with marketing staff. <br><br>  Only after that you can start working with materials for the site.  And only after receiving the finished materials - draw layouts for the designer, defining priority navigation elements, texts and their location in the layouts. <br><br>  Every action must be justified and justified. <br><br>  PS Sometimes everyone does the opposite, that they first collect materials in a heap, structure them, adjust them to the Internet format and think for a long time who the target audience is and who is interested in this information. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107640/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107640/</a></p>
