Involvement implies interaction, but does not focus on enhancing the effect, which is the driving factor in awareness. <br><br>  For example, involvement in Twitter includes all types of public interactions that can occur between a brand and a user ‚Äî <i>Likes, Retweets, Replies, and Mentions</i> , but only <b>Retweets and Mentions</b> , as they raise brand awareness among people who have never heard of it before. <br><br>  Metrics such as <i>Impressions and Coverage are</i> ideal for measuring performance to increase overall awareness.  <i>Impressions</i> - the total number of times that tweets from your page appeared in the tapes of other Twitter users, or the tweets in which your page was mentioned. <br><br>  <i>Coverage</i> will help not only count the number of users with whom you interacted directly, but also the subscribers of these users who could pay attention to your page and tweets as well.  that's what's important.  The main task of social marketing is to increase the number of users and to inform as many people as possible about the brand. <br><br>  <b><u>Increase in Demand</u></b> <b><br></b>  <b><i>(Site Traffic + Involvement)</i></b> <br><br>  If one of the objectives is to increase demand, then <i>Involvement</i> will be one of the key parameters, but much more important is how people navigate the site and how they got there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dde/63e/eae/dde63eeaef8f4fac9c768d86c199c618.png"><br><br>  Your strategy should include not just increasing <i>Involvement</i> - you should purposefully increase the involvement of the target audience and opinion leaders.  Anyone can enter the market with a couple of wound up posts and swim in likes and comments.  A serious social strategy should be more complex. <br><br>  After all, increasing demand is a true marketing task.  Your goal is to bring a person closer to the brand so that when he reaches the next step (making a purchase decision), the brand will seem to be the only reasonable choice.  Think in terms of traffic.  Do your actions help bring the user closer to the decision in favor of "their" brand?  Visitors (both in the offline store and on the website) is a key metric in the decision making process. <br><br>  <b><u>Promotion Conversion</u></b> <b><br></b>  <b><i>(Clicks + Conversions + Involvement)</i></b> <br><br>  At the decision stage, your task is simple: encourage conversions.  You want people to buy a product or, in the case of a media publisher, to interact with your content. <br><br>  At the decision stage, link clicks will be key performance indicators for most brands.  Whether you sell mobile apps or shoes, your goal remains unchanged - so that users can go to the site and buy something. <br><br>  Sales is the main goal of any business, but any sales have their stages.  For example, a customer will first need to download an application through which he will be able to make purchases, see your advertisement and share his email address, so that you can use this communication channel, or maybe go to your shop and buy ‚ÄúFlaming Hot Cheetos with Lime. " <br><br>  <b><u>Customer Satisfaction</u></b> <b><br></b>  <b><i>(Tonality + Response Time + Involvement)</i></b> <br><br>  When a user purchased a product, downloaded an application, or visited a restaurant, it is desirable that he repeat his visit or purchase.  Your goal is to keep the acquired buyer and sell him something else. <br><br>  The key performance indicator at this stage will be <i>positive references to the</i> brand, as well as customer service metrics like response time, frequency of responses and repeated visits. <br><br>  In this case, the <i>positive tonality and satisfaction with the</i> product is quite measurable.  Metrics such as <b>CLTV</b> ( <a href="http://economy_en_ru.academic.ru/12660/combined_loan-to-value_ratio">Combined Loan To Value Ratio</a> ) and positive developments are also very useful and can be viewed as part of the company's marketing activities. <br><br>  <b><u>Spread Promotion</u></b> <b><br></b>  <b><i>(Growth of Impressions + Growth of Coverage + Social PC (User Content) + Impact on Opinion Leaders + Involvement)</i></b> <br><br>  The main objective of the propaganda phase is to promote distribution, or to make your buyers become your best sellers in helping to spread information about the brand in the circle of their communication. <br><br>  Your task in this case is to encourage the distribution of advertising information by users.  And if they already liked the brand, then this should not be particularly difficult. <br><br>  Promotion of <i>Distribution</i> is measured in much the same way as <i>Awareness</i> , but with more emphasis on ‚Äúearned‚Äù media: impressions, reach and user content that was not created under the direct influence of your marketing department. <br><br>  In this case, measurements should focus on <i>Referrals</i> (how many new customers current customers bring), <i>Customer Loyalty Index</i> (how do people relate to the brand), and <i>General Impressions</i> (what is the average tone of statements in relation to the social media brand?). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300490/</a></p>
