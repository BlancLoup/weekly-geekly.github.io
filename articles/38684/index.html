  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The reverse side of karma ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Karma is a direct representation of the habrac user.</i>  <i>The more interesting his posts and comments, the more users will want to increase his karma ...</i> - Reference section Habrahabr. <br><br>  There are quite a lot of topics on the topic of ‚ÄúHabr‚Äù changes over time (a la Habr was different and so on), and habouriors try to explain this phenomenon using different approaches (see, for example, ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/offtopic/38555/">What happens to Habrom from a technical point view</a> ").  However, it seems to me that the main reason for the changes lies in principle, adopted at Habr√© - Karma is to blame for everything :). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The fact is that there is a tendency both in posts and in comments: the one who managed to satisfy most of the users (regardless of the essence of the post or comment), and not the one whose ‚Äúposts and comments are more interesting‚Äù, receives benefits.  Minus those who express a point of view that does not coincide with the majority opinion.  However, this does not mean that the one who receives the ‚Äú+‚Äù is right, but the one who receives the ‚Äú-‚Äù is not right ... I know, I did not discover America ... <br><br>  Note: these pluses and minusiki do not force to strain - just poked the button and walked on.  Even reading a comment or post is not necessary - just run through his eyes.  And you can not read at all - look at the author's nickname and estimate, it belongs to your ‚Äúallies‚Äù or you don‚Äôt like him after some old skirmish, and, based on this, already poke at ‚Äú+‚Äù or ‚Äú-‚Äù.  Notice trolling exists not because the users are so bad (this is by itself, of course), but because the system freely allows you to make estimates without straining.  Minus without looking, even comments and posts that contain several thoughts at once ... The authors have a logical question: what exactly does the minus disagree with?

      But this is only one side of karma and rating.  The other is the desire to get more pluses and less minus ones.  What is needed for this?  Obviously writing is what satisfies most.  If you write posts, then, for example, in the "humor" - there is no need to strain too much and you can get a serious increase in karma.  If you leave comments, it is enough to run through the eyes of the comments of other users in the new post and write yourself in the same way.  Even the post itself is not necessary to read.  Phrases like ‚ÄúThank you, very useful information, write more‚Äù are universal and like most of the users, although they do not carry any information.  You can also make a "correction" of the text of the post - without going into its essence, casually write that "instead of" Belarus "is written correctly" Belarus "or" Belarus "... - so you also get an increase to the rating and / or karma. <br><br>  As a result of just such an action of the karma mechanism, we have what we have: an increase in the number of topics on a common topic and comments that do not carry useful information. <br><br>  If at the time of grading (at least when setting a ‚Äúminus‚Äù), it was necessary to explain why you put such a mark, there would be no trolling, for example, and categorical marks just disappeared.  People would be forced to grasp the posts and comments and think about what to write in response, and not just thoughtlessly poke buttons.  Of course, in a situation where users have to take responsibility for their ratings, the number of ratings will decrease.  However, their weight will be much more tangible than now. <br><br>  PS An interesting observation: karma and rating, originally intended to be tools for assessing the adequacy of users, became the ultimate goals of work in the system. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38684/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38684/</a></p>
