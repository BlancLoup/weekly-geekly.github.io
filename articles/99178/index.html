  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What do I miss in Yandex.Direct?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Despite the numerous and mostly groundless accusations of "scam", "scam" and other nonsense, Yandex.Direct is really the most effective and, I am not afraid of this word, the most convenient in the system of contextual advertising. <br><br>  But, as you know, there is no limit to perfection.  Let's try to figure out what users are missing (both regular and advertising agencies) for complete happiness. <br><br>  In my opinion, the implementation of only three proposals can turn Yandex.Direct from the best system into an almost perfect one.

      So the sentences are in order of importance. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Problem number 1 Daily budget - long and tedious</b> <br><br>  All (most certainly, especially the RA) know that there are no rubber budgets.  Every day you can not spend an infinite amount.  What to do? <br><br>  A certain campaign is being launched, let's call it ‚ÄúBank‚Äù with the entire amount credited to it.  Then every day the diligent manager in the morning (in the evening, in the afternoon, not the essence) transfers the required amounts to the appropriate campaigns.  And what if such campaigns, for example, more than two hundred?  That's right, hang yourself. Why so much time for a simple operation?  And if the manager suddenly got sick for a couple of days? <br><br>  <i>Solution to the problem</i> <br><br>  We already have a "transfer of funds."  So why not automate it for those who really need it?  Let's give users the ability to automatically assign a campaign daily budget or automate (with the ability to on / off) "transfer funds".  And let the smart, in quotes, the robot itself carries the funds, and the manager will do more important things, such as monitoring rates. <br><br>  <b>Problem number 2 Lack of living space in the interface</b> <br><br>  Everyone saw the most comfortable daddy in the interface - "Favorites".  Remarkable folder, provided that the strategies of rates - only two.  For example, you need to keep your favorite ads in special placement.  But work turns into a nightmare when the number of strategies is more than two.  In this case, the Active folder simply loses its meaning.  Well, active there, and so what?  How to monitor them normally? <br><br>  For example, we have 500 ads in the campaign.  One hundred of them must be kept in the SR, another two hundred in the guarantee, the rest should hang out in the guarantee or lower.  Now try to imagine the management of all this economy.  True, hellish job. <br><br>  <i>Solution to the problem</i> <br><br>  The problem is solved simply.  If we take into account that the average number of strategies is 4 (special placement, first place, guarantee, dynamics), then we vitally lack the addition to the interface of a maximum of four more folders with arbitrary names.  Even if we leave the esthets who want to get into 1 or 3 special placement, they will sort out the positions of the show even in this situation. <br><br>  We give users the ability to create 3 new folders, and everything falls into place. <br><br>  So, here are our folders: <br><br>  Active <br>  Moderation <br>  Rejected <br>  Stopped <br>  Archive <br>  Favorites <br>  Everything <br>  Drafts <br>  Favorites 1 <br>  Favorites 2 <br>  Favorites 3 <br><br>  The user gives the names of the last three folders himself (if technically this is possible).  If not, it will do without it. <br><br>  Yes, there will be more folders, 11 instead of 8, the interface may be overloaded, but this is nothing compared to the comfort and convenience of the new interface. <br><br>  By the way, why not just hide folder names without useful content? <br><br>  <b>Problem number 3 Effective ads - to favorites</b> <br><br>  Imagine the following situation.  We customize 500 ads, we start working, everything is fine.  A week later, we analyze the statistics on the phrases and see that only 20% of the requests are actually converted into transactions.  And they, alas, are not at all those that we originally intended.  Question: ‚Äúhow to quickly put them in the‚Äú favorites ‚Äùfolder directly from the statistics on phrases‚Äù?  The answer: no way.  Be kind to sit for hours and sift through a sieve all 500 pieces, noting the right ones. <br><br>  <i>Solution to the problem</i> <br><br>  Screw the link ‚Äúadd to favorites‚Äù in the interface ‚Äústatistics by phrases‚Äù.  Taking into account the solution to Problem 2, the link can be in the form of a drop-down menu with folder names. <br><br>  A more preferred option will allow you to avoid the load on the interface: we give the opportunity to mark the desired ads (as in the interface of the campaign itself) and put them in bulk in the appropriate folders (menu at the bottom of the page). <br><br>  Ps.  I would very much like to hear the opinions of colleagues in the workshop, as well as discuss in the comments possible suggestions for the interface and functionality of Yandex.Direct. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99178/</a></p>
