We are announcing the <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/kursrik/">results of a study</a> conducted <a href="http://kursrik.ru/">by the RIC business school</a> with expert support from Ruward on the situation in the HR market of web developers in Russia. <br><br>  The study analyzed almost 400 questionnaires of representatives of companies from the web development segment, and also monitored the popularity of vacancies on major employment portals. <br><br>  For several years now we have regularly heard from managers and directors the question: ‚Äúwhere can we get programmers?‚Äù.  Therefore, we decided to get down to business and begin to address this issue.  To begin with, we had to figure out which programmers are needed at all - and in what quantities - for this we launched an open poll in November 2013.

      Methodology of the study: an online survey of representatives of companies from the web development segment, its own analysis of specialized open vacancies on major employment portals. <br><br>  Following the results of four months of research, diluted with the month of the New Year holidays and the month of the Olympiad, we finally publish the results. <br><br><h4>  Thousands of them </h4><br> <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/kursrik/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/023/320/236/0233202368d3484cfbd278bae7522534.png" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In total, 368 questionnaires were analyzed as part of the survey for screening obvious inadequacies.  A total of 368 companies require 2,658 developers at various levels - from a trainee to a technical director.  On average - 7 people per company.  This characterizes the personnel shortage that has been going on for several years in this market segment. <br><br> <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/kursrik/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46f/6cf/ef4/46f6cfef4e63e64e3cfcd922c6c35bd9.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Programmers on simple platforms are most in demand: PHP, HTML, JavaScript. <br><br>  More sophisticated Java and .Net platforms turned out to be much less popular.  It should be clarified that the study was largely attended by companies that develop software products in the Internet environment. <br><br>  Roughly speaking, PHP is more popular for developing Internet products than other languages.  Exotics like Python, C ++, Ruby on Rails, Django are not very popular: 65% of respondents strictly adhere to the classics (PHP, Java, .Net) and generally do not use rare new-fangled technologies. <br><br>  The most popular of the "exotic" Python is used in the work of only 17% of companies. <br><br><h4>  And the king is naked! </h4><br> <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/kursrik/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7a/149/93a/f7a14993aa02434386c9e20568b21590.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The study revealed an interesting link: on simple platforms, more ordinary developers are needed, and on ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù there is a significant bias towards technical directors. <br><br>  The distribution of the need for developers by skill level in the framework of simple platforms (PHP, Frontend) and in the framework of complex (Java, .Net) is almost the same. <br><br>  Grade terminology within which the study was conducted: <br><br><ul><li>  trainee: can write code under supervision; </li><li>  developer: makes simple projects himself, medium and complex - under supervision; </li><li>  Lead developer: he makes the project of any complexity; </li><li>  team leader: manages the development team on one or more projects; </li><li>  architect: designs complex systems; </li><li>  Technical Director: leads the development department as a business manager, is responsible for the profitability and development of the department. </li></ul><br> <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/kursrik/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/962/3b0/c31/9623b0c314262a8a11b8ba3cf3c2f7f5.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  As a result of the analysis, it became clear that most companies need ordinary PHP-developers and ordinary developers of interfaces.  This is a rather strange fact, considering that it is possible to learn a regular PHP programmer or layout designer in just one year using forums, books and inexpensive courses in well-known educational institutions. <br><br> <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/kursrik/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3b/959/bc6/c3b959bc617cc02c1caec68dd0c27dc2.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  As part of the study, more than 500 applications for technical directors in various areas were identified.  If we add to this our personal communication with representatives of Internet companies, the problem will become obvious: there are very few real managers with IT specialization. <br><br><h4>  Popular frameworks </h4><br> <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/kursrik/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e86/73d/aed/e8673daed94a1b59c56e97ef80dfc2dc.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The results are quite expected: in PHP, with a huge margin, 1C-Bitrix wins, among JS libraries ‚Äî Jquery, .net developers like raw ASP.NET, and Java developers ‚Äî classic JavaSE, JavaEE, and Spring. <br><br>  Of the interesting points: more than a third of companies use in XSLT projects.  Also unexpected was the second place C ++ among the ‚Äúexotic‚Äù (for the web) technologies: after all, this is a rather difficult to understand low-level programming language. <br><br>  There was also some chaos in the compilation of a set of technological tools.  If among the surveyed companies someone has a PHP department, then in the list of PHP platforms used, as a rule, there are 1-2 different frameworks.  .Net developers are also quite conservative in this regard.  But JavaScript and Java developers use a whole bunch of frameworks: for the most part up to 3-4 different platforms are used, and in some cases up to 6-7. <br><br><h4>  Order on the table - order in the head </h4><br> <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/kursrik/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51a/6a4/5b9/51a6a45b95fa2b766b24cb65687ce39f.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  85% of surveyed companies use a version control system.  It is not clear how the remaining 15% work ... Probably, they make simple projects that are created by one developer in one week. <br><br>  If we talk about the popularity of version control systems, the ‚Äúfashionable‚Äù GIT is expectedly won, and not the fashionable SVN won silver by a wide margin from its rivals. <br><br> <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/kursrik/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db5/b0f/66c/db5b0f66c882e486a9072994e20c135f.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Using task trackers, everything is also quite prosaic: Jira and Redmine have been confident leaders for many years.  13 companies still use samopisny trackers, and two companies from the respondents do not manage tasks at all.  By the way, these 2 companies are included in 15% of versions that refused to control.  There are opposite situations: 5 companies use 4 different trackers simultaneously. <br><br><h4>  Broad is my native land </h4><br> <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/kursrik/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d27/504/5e9/d275045e9f933c503f0eb822ce21274f.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Statistics on cities in which developers are needed, also did not bring revelations: Moscow, St. Petersburg and the Moscow region are leading by a wide margin.  Nizhny, Kazan, Novosibirsk, Samara and Tomsk are long-known clusters of Internet developers.  However, in many respects this may be a consequence of the channels used to attract respondents. <br><br>  Our survey accidentally became international: about 30 companies have representative offices in Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia and Azerbaijan. <br><br>  70 companies (19% of respondents) work with remote employees outside the office. <br><br><h4>  Training and hunting </h4><br> <a href="http://www.ruward.ru/kursrik/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c20/d1f/fe3/c20d1ffe3e8b4c609ef8dcd016518860.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Most companies are willing to pay one salary for training or hunting for a developer position.  About 30% of respondents refuse to pay for such services or refrain from answering this question.  It is worth noting that in general, employers are willing to pay more for tuition than for hunting. <br><br><h4>  Results of the study </h4><br>  Of the 368 applications, 23 people wrote a detailed comment.  Basically it was about the fact that the programmer needs not only engineering skills, but also the so-called soft-skills: the ability to work in a team, the skills to solve non-standard creative tasks, risk assessment, time management. <br><br>  The main findings of the study: <br><br><ul><li>  In the market of web developers there is a sharp personnel shortage; </li><li>  It is worth noting the widespread shortage of IT-managers; </li><li>  Companies, for the most part, use stable running-in technologies; </li><li>  The main development centers are located in the capitals of Russia. </li></ul><br>  By the way, after analyzing the results of our own research, our colleagues from the RIC quickly jumped around and organized a new educational course ‚Äú <a href="http://kursrik.ru/business_and_management/cto/">Technical Director</a> ‚Äù, which we recommend with both hands for pumping our own skills. <br><br>  Yura Gugnin, managing partner of RIC, added a few words about him: ‚ÄúThe <i>main task of the course is to convey to technical top managers that they are not only engineers, but also managers. We‚Äôll tell you about tools for managing profitability and motivation, highlighting methods of hunting and development good programmers, consider in detail the process of managing the quality of a software product</i> .
