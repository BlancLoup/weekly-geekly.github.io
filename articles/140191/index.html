  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Call recording on Android</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think quite a few want to be able to record their own telephone conversations on their smartphone for 20 thousand rubles.  The task seems to be banal, and it seems that <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder.AudioSource.html">the</a> Android <a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/MediaRecorder.AudioSource.html">API</a> allows you to do this.  But why the recording does not work on almost all devices without any shamans and dances with a tambourine? <br><br><h4>  Law </h4><br>  The thing is that in some countries the recording is illegal and manufacturers do not waste time adding this feature.  But what about those who live in countries where recording conversations is not prohibited.  For example, in Russia there is no ban on recording your own telephone conversations; you don‚Äôt even need to warn the other party about the recording.  Only you can listen to the recordings of your conversations, i.e.  if you give the recording to a third party, it will be regarded as a violation of Article 23 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. <br><br><h4>  Phone </h4><br>  In some devices, the kernel does not contain the necessary driver, in some devices, recording is disabled in the system libraries.  Therefore, the recording does not work on these phones in any of the dozens of programs in the Market.  It is not surprising, because they all write conversations in the same way.  But on some phones the recording works without any dancing with a tambourine, for example, on the Samsung Galaxy S II.  But not on every firmware, for example, on Android 4 ICS, the recording no longer works, apparently, Samsung decided that users do not need it and removed it. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Dances with a tambourine </h4><br>  However, not everything is so bad.  There is a way to record conversations using root-rights and a special custom kernel, which contains the necessary driver for recording conversations.  On some devices, this driver is already contained in the sink core, so there is no need to install a custom kernel.  In this way, at the moment, you can achieve recording on devices that are built on Qualcomm's chipsets such as QSD8250 (HTC Desire, Nexus One, HTC HD2, etc.), QSD8255 (HTC Desire HD, HTC Incredible S, SE Xperia Ray and others.) and QSD8260 (HTC Sensation, Samsung SGH-T989 Galaxy S II, HTC EVO 3D, etc.).  Recording is also possible on some old Qualcomm MSM72xx chipsets. <br><br><h4>  Record through the core </h4><br>  The first thing to do is find out on which chipset the phone is built.  Then you need to find a special kernel with support for recording from the line, this can be done on xda-developers.com or w3bsit3-dns.com.  If you have found a kernel for your phone where record support is claimed (sometimes denoted 2wcr or CallRec), then you can proceed to unlocking the bootloader / getting S-OFF, installing recovery, getting root-rights and flashing the found kernel.  If you didn‚Äôt find a write-supported kernel for your phone, but the phone‚Äôs chipset should support it, then write to the developer or kernel developers for your phone, please add <a href="http://code.google.com/p/2-way-call-recording/source/browse/">this patch</a> to your kernel or kernels. <br><br><h4>  Record via standard Android'a API </h4><br>  If the recording through the kernel is impossible on your phone, then there is a chance that there are special ones with recording support.  As a rule, these are three files: libaudio.so, libaudioflinger.so and libaudiopolicy.so packed in .zip for firmware via recovery.  I also want to emphasize that this patch can only work on certain firmware.  For example, on the Samsung Galaxy S, recording can only be achieved on Android 2.2 Froyo, on other firmwares the recording does not work.  As a rule, these libraries are pulled out from the Chinese firmware.  Typically, recording via a Bluetooth headset does not work well. <br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  Several programs support writing through the kernel, one of them is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rvoix/downloads/list">rVoix</a> , a free open source program.  The author of this program is also the author of kernel <a href="http://code.google.com/p/2-way-call-recording/">patches</a> and thanks to him the recording became possible on many devices. <br><br>  There is another program with support for writing through the kernel - <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D263718">CallRecorder</a> , the author of which I am. <br><br>  If the problem was not in the kernel, but in the system libraries, the recording should work in all other programs for recording conversations, of which there are quite a lot in the Market. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140191/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140191/</a></p>
