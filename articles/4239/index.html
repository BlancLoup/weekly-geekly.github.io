  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Flash technology is ten years old</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Flash history began when the small company Future Wave released a simple editor for vector graphics on graphic tablets.  In 1996, the animation feature was added, and the program itself was renamed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FutureSplash">FutureSplash Animator</a> .  Together with the program, a special plug-in was also released, with which it was possible to view the created cartoons in a web browser. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Vector animation through the plugin in the browser - it was quite an interesting technical solution that immediately attracted the attention of large players.  Macromedia turned out to be the most courageous and generous of them. They released tools for creating web applications.  She bought Future Wave in December 1996 and immediately renamed the program to Flash 1. <br><br>  Ten years later, the Flash Player plugin is installed almost everywhere.  According <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html">to</a> NPD Online <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html">statistics</a> , it works on 98% of all computers connected to the Internet.  Not so long ago, a version of Flash Player for Linux was released (this version <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/penguin.swf/">is being actively developed</a> ), so now the plugin is available on all popular platforms. <br><br>  At the end of last year, Adobe bought Macromedia.  In honor of the decade of remarkable technology, Adobe has opened a special <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/special/flashanniversary/">microsite</a> dedicated to the anniversary.

      Mike Downey, Adobe's chief product manager for the Flash product line, in <a href="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,71558-0.html">an interview with</a> Wired, talks about the history and prospects of this technology.  The first turning point in the transformation of Flash from the animation package into a universal platform for web applications, Mike Downey, considers the release of the fourth version of Flash with support for scripts.  This allowed developers to create games, interactive presentations and full-fledged Flash-based programs for the first time. <br><br>  In the fifth version of the script engine was rewritten and renamed ActionScript.  Until now, it remains the main, most important function of the program. <br><br>  Another important point in the history of Flash development was video support in the sixth version.  Thanks to this, Flash has today become the main platform for video broadcasting on the Web.  It has the largest internet video sites, such as <a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a> , <a href="http://video.google.com/">Google Video</a> and <a href="http://myspace.com/">MySpace</a> . <br><br>  In June 2006, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/lenta/206/">Flash Player 9</a> was released with a new version of the script engine, as well as the environment for web development <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/article/211/">Adobe Flex 2</a> , largely duplicating the functionality of Ajax. <br><br>  If you look to the future, Adobe is confident that web developers will create more and more interactive specialized sites for which the Flash platform is the best fit.  For six years now, Adobe has been trying to port Flash to mobile devices, and, finally, it has achieved significant progress.  Recently, an agreement was signed with Qualcomm, according to which content providers have the right to install Flash Player on any portable BREW device. <br><br>  The company continues to work for the future.  Now, about halfway through, is the process of creating the next generation designer package, codenamed Adobe Blaze.  The main task during its creation is tight integration with other Adobe programs.  The company recently conducted a study and found that 90% of developers using Flash use the Adobe Photoshop program at the same time.  In addition, Blaze will be integrated also with Flash, Illustrator and After Effects.  As Mike Downey says, it will be something amazing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4239/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4239/</a></p>
