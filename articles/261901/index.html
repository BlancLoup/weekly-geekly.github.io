Yes, even at the level of large software systems and complex information systems, this terminology can be applied if we talk about the exchange of hyperlinks at a high organizational level.  Let me take advantage of this verbal pun and tell you about an important milestone in the development of our software package - the integration of the professional help system ‚ÄúTechExpert‚Äù with the popular CAD system ‚ÄúCompass-3D‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The main thing is that all communications are professional.</b> <br><br>  The fact that any designer periodically needs to refer to the normative-technical documentation, GOST, SNIP, taxiways and other important regulatory materials is a fact.  And not only to the designer, but in general to any engineer or normocontroller - actual regulatory documents are needed by all, regardless of the field in which the specialist works.  Even to me, the humble author of this material, in order to determine how well the prepared text complies with the standards, before you submit it for proofreading, you often have to turn to professional sources for an answer.  But, first of all, such a need is, of course, among engineers of a different profile.

      Understanding the importance of this functionality, we agreed in February with the company ASCON, the developer of the popular Compass-3D system, about combining our integration efforts.  The result of these agreements was the creation of an intelligent panel right in the working environment of this CAD system ‚ÄúCompass-3D‚Äù, which will allow you to place complex hyperlinks between CAD systems and regulatory documents in professional help systems ‚ÄúTechExpert‚Äù.  All users of our systems can work with this panel now. <br><br>  <b>What is the point?</b> <br><br>  Imagine you are creating three-dimensional models or working with drawings in Compass-3D.  To solve engineering problems, you urgently need to go to an important GOST, without being distracted from the project.  Our smart panel allows you to quickly navigate to the desired document in the system, open the TechExpert without leaving Compass-3D, and also place hyperlinks to all regulatory documents in your drawing.  The same works for multi-page projects - in this case, the specialist can use the automatic placement of hyperlinks, which will reduce the time of his work on combining the necessary graphics with the relevant regulatory documentation by a hundred times.  We also provided for the case when it is necessary to place links only to selected documents - now this can be done manually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5be/5f0/840/5be5f08402c94417b6a30506c87d1c5a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>In the name of love (to colleagues)</b> <br><br>  In addition to the convenience of a loved one, you also need to remember about colleagues who will work with the project in the future - which is why it seems to us that the released module will be useful for users of both TechExpert and Compass-3D.  And so, what's the matter. <br><br>  For example, you are preparing a drawing.  Further, it is received by a specialist in quality control or a technologist who, in one click, can proceed to the standards to which you referred.  An employee of a workshop can do the same if he uses electronic documentation.  In general, such a system of exchanging hyperlinks at the level of a single technological enterprise, in addition to direct practical benefits, can be another step towards the abandonment of paper technologies, which can at times optimize the entire production process. <br><br>  In general, if you are interested in the use of CAD and PLM technologies in mechanical engineering, as well as the creation of integrated automation systems, then these issues will be covered in detail in the upcoming series of seminars dedicated to the Machine Builder Day.  The seminars are traditionally held by our partner, ASCON, and they will be held in 12 cities of Russia.  We invite everyone who works in CAD or is interested in PLM-technologies to join.  Details can be found on the ASCON website.  I, in turn, will be glad if you also find our integration solution useful.  And if you are interested in learning about our other technologies, then you can read about it, for example, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/kodeks/blog/243439/">right here</a> .  See you, friends. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261901/</a></p>
