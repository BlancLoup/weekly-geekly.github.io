  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PushFeed - monitoring RSS and VK feeds</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8c/2k/h5/8c2kh5x27-bw0bsgxfyhzl-yv-a.png"><br>  Many probably have a problem with tracking information.  From the very beginning of PushAll, we have integrated the feeds with RSS feeds, and then with VKontakte feeds.  Despite the fact that there are now many different RSS readers, many have created feeds only to receive notifications about new tapes themselves, which is at odds with the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating feeds ‚Äî sending notifications to groups of people. <br><br>  We created <a href="https://pushall.ru/pushfeed">the microservice channel PushFeed</a> , which allows you to specify the ribbon, filters, priority, lifetime and other parameters - to receive notifications from this channel to any of your devices with the parameters you need. <br><br> <a href="https://pushall.ru/channels/pushfeed/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h5/ja/3u/h5ja3ufzh-tqej2vpktrojo-uhq.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  How does PushFeed work? </h2><br>  PushFeed is a microservice channel created on the <a href="https://pushall.ru/">PushAll.ru</a> platform, which allows you to enter your feeds, specify their parameters and receive notifications.  To be more precise, the channel takes each of your tapes, counts the time for its next check and puts it in a queue.  Tapes and their parameters are stored in Redis. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      The entire architecture of PushFeed runs on a simple scheduler inside a MySQL table over time.  The script takes time records from the database and creates messages in RabbitMQ, which process 50 threads of the caster.  With current settings, you can handle up to 500 requests per second.  Also, using RabbitMQ, you can easily connect additional servers to the processing. <br><br>  The scan time is set for each user.  Standard time is 10 minutes.  This time is broken into your selected channels.  In addition, each VK tape is updated 5 times faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yp/gd/9e/ypgd9enbblafdrmwsrt7uvep2t8.png"><br><br>  In 10 minutes you can process 300 thousand tapes. <br><br>  Each stream of a konsyumer determines the last time of checking and compares the time of the last entry in the tape.  If the entry is newer, it sends a notification.  Also for patrons available to receive all the records created between checks. <br><br>  We remind you that PushAll is able to send notifications to <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pushall/cbdcdhkdonnpnilabcdfnoiokhgbigka">Google Chrome</a> browsers <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pushall/cbdcdhkdonnpnilabcdfnoiokhgbigka">through an extension</a> , to Chrome-like browsers and Firefox via WebPush, to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.bupyc.pushall.app">Android via an application</a> , to <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/pushall/id1021404069">iOS through an application</a> , to Safari, <a href="https://telegram.me/PushAllBot">to Telegram,</a> and even to email. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pushall/blog/319682/">Learn more about where we can send notifications.</a> <br><br><h2>  Restrictions </h2><br>  PushFeed processes up to 10 feeds of mixed content: RSS feeds and Vkontakte groups feeds.  Soon to this list will be added more and tape comments comments - you can add for example the discussion where there is an important discussion, stretched over the years.  Processing time 10 minutes.  (in the previous paragraph of the article there is a sign) The more active tapes, the less often they are updated. <br><br>  There is also a patron mode - it should be familiar to those who use <a href="https://pushall.ru/adminvk">AdminVK</a> .  It works so that you transfer a donation of 100 or more rubles per month and become a patron of the arts.  You can place your channel in a special section of the PushAll catalog, you can get into a special block of the list of patrons in the donations section, and most importantly turn on the patron mode in AdminVK and PushFeed.  We did not somehow divide the mechanics, so add.  Opportunities are included immediately in both microservices. <br><br>  In the patron mode, everything works 10 times faster, but not more than once every 30 seconds.  Soon you can add up to 100 tapes, and recently it became available to scan all the records, and not just the last one <b>(scanning all records is available to all users, regardless of whether you are a patron or not, until the end of January 2018)</b> <br><br>  PushFeed is able to take the avatar of the user VK, who published the post, his first and last name.  The text of the post comes to the notification body.  Also for the VK feed there is a search for pictures attached to the post for placing a large image to the notification. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w8/yi/q7/w8yiq7kphptys6tlsrb1a2c99ee.png"><br><br>  Inside the RSS feeds there is also a search for IMG tags in the text of the feed.  If possible, send us examples of where images are hidden in RSS feeds. <br><br><h2>  This is not an RSS aggregator. </h2><br>  RSS here is only an auxiliary item.  The idea itself is not in the RSS feed reader, but to get certain news and posts in RSS / VK to receive them in the form of a notification and to respond. <br><br>  The need for me personally in this service has ripened at the moment when I started using several communities on VKontakte.  It is not publics who post all kinds of memes and news, but communities.  The difference is that in communities they are not written by the communities themselves or their admins - <b>people write in the communities.</b> <br><br>  Examples of such communities can be, for example, bulletin boards - tracking such communities allows you to quickly find the used goods at a low price.  Also, thematic communities can be an example - people write here as an example on programming <a href="https://vk.com/echo_php">vk.com/echo_php</a> .  There can be many examples of such groups, for example, I have several communities on bicycle topics, some probably have some communities where there are small communities like freelance exchanges, and the speed of reaction there may be decisive. <br><br>  And in different cases, different priorities and time settings are required, for example, for freelance exchanges, you can set the TTL to 1 hour and high priority.  If you don‚Äôt open the message in an hour, the application has most likely already been taken.  It also helps filtering - in keywords you can exclude technologies that you do not work with, and also add those that interest you. <br><br>  We saw the demand for such tracking in the example of AdminVK.  At the very beginning, there were many people who needed to keep track of their groups, and then these same people began to think about how it would be convenient to receive notifications on any group if something new is published in it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_e/ts/x4/_etsx4j8ydv4hqyocboifgdb4we.jpeg"><br>  "How to respond to the polls first of all" <br><br>  It is also a counterweight to the VKontakte smart tape.  Surely you, like me, began to go more often to the groups themselves than to go to the tape, where not all posts are displayed.  <a href="https://pushall.ru/pushfeed">PushFeed</a> saves you time - it will check these tapes for you. <br><br><h2>  We are working on quality work </h2><br>  Over the past six months, we have fixed many minor, and not very minor problems in the work of PushAll.  Stabilized sending notifications to devices, increased the speed of sending. <br><br>  We even made recently <a href="https://pushall.ru/status.php">open statistics for sending notifications by time.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tb/p7/ll/tbp7llxzudfx2lefyepi2j-49ag.png"><br><br>  Detailed statistics will soon be available to channel owners, with an additional indication of the number of received and open notifications. <br><br>  The administration of PushAll wishes you a happy new year!  We wish you a quick delivery of alerts, lack of spam, always relevant and useful information in the new year! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345930/</a></p>
