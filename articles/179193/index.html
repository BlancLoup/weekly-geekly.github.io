  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nokia resurrected N9 as Asha 501?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday, Nokia introduced a smartphone, which already flashed on the network some time ago as N9mini.  In fact, it turned out to be the updated Asha series smartphone, which, in fact, was easy to predict.  But the user interface of MeeGo Harmattan, practically copied (judging by the videos), was a surprise for me personally. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/154515/">tested the first models in</a> sufficient <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/154515/">detail on the Series40 Asha Touch platform</a> , on the updated version of which <a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/phone/asha501-dual-sim/specifications/">Asha501</a> works, so the fact that now the user interface is implemented within this platform, which I consider the most convenient of everything on the mobile market, of course, interested me.  Here are some videos demonstrating how the Series40 Asha Touch works with the MeeGo Harmattan UI on the Asha501: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_embedded%26v%3DD6iMsePF0kk">_1_</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_embedded%26v%3DGsXUvR9k0FA">_2_</a> , <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_embedded%26v%3DwQk_WP7CZp8">_3_</a>

      Of course, it is difficult to judge the platform in absentia, however, I think all those moments that were implemented in previous Asha Touch models have been preserved in the updated version.  Added only svayp-management, notifications on the lock screen and other elements from MeeGo Harmattan.  As a result, my words about the fact that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174081/">Nokia plans to support the S40 Touch only until such time as it is also available for the budget segment of FirefoxOS</a> , I take it back.  Now, as it seems to me, Asha Touch is a very attractive offer in the budget segment.  Of course, we need to look at what is happening with the application database, but, on the other hand, Nokia constantly holds training workshops for developers, so it seems that, especially with the release of Asha501, the application database will be actively replenished. <br><br>  However, in connection with all this I am interested in something completely different.  An interesting fact is that in the last two builds of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGa1dZ4vghY4">Nemo Mobile</a> , a platform that is a continuation of MeeGo Harmattan, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178181/">user interface is implemented all from the same N9</a> .  Apparently, NemoMobile (developed by the Maemo.org community and Jolla startup developing SailfishOS) will eventually become a platform that will be actively ported to third-party devices.  And SailfishOS will be a commercial and original version of a similar distribution, which will be pre-installed on specific branded Jolla devices. <br><br>  That is, it turns out that the MeeGo Harmattan interface will be presented in two (even in three, if you count the original) software platforms.  There are many who will start using sensors from Asha501 and will get used to the svayp-interface and subsequently will want to install the NemoMobile open platform on a more powerful device.  Or buy the same N9, which, as I suspect, Nokia continues to successfully produce and sell for money absolutely absurdly ridiculous for such a device.  <a href="">N9 according to Yandex.Market costs less than 8 thousand rubles</a> . <br><br>  The user interface habit is very strong.  That is what bribes Apple.  It is not excluded that Nokia, Blackberry and Jolla, developing a svayp-interface, albeit several different modifications, plan to conquer their user in such ways.  That is, I mean that Nokia is most likely consciously preparing the upcoming Nemo users, the platform that will become the first truly open platform, that is, the platform being installed on almost any other device. <br><br>  As for the Asha Touch based on the S40, it should be felt.  But taking into account my experience of testing previous devices on Asha Touch, and also taking into account my experience of using the N9, I think this model will have a very big success. <br><br>  While Apple was on the iPhone mini, Nokia really released the N9mini. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179193/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179193/</a></p>
