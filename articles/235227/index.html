This time you will be able to hear the wise speeches of three speakers who will speak on very different topics.  In the front ranks of the speakers will be none other than Grigori Petrov (Digital October). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d4/e47/487/9d4e4748773941b6b53eaf642866c0bc.jpg" align="left">  Gregory regularly speaks at conferences for a reason.  He believes that this benefits not only the developer community, but also himself.  Especially for this meeting, Grigory prepared a report in which you will hear the programmer's thoughts on public speaking, willpower, the need for a presentation and the key role of the hippocampus in the professional growth of an IT person.  The report is divided into three parts: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Why go to conferences and speak at them</b> <br>  All kinds of conferences and meetings will be carefully considered from two points of view: guests and speakers.  Why did they come to the event?  What benefits do they plan to extract for themselves?  How and for what purpose can the speaker benefit? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>How to prepare a presentation</b> <br>  In the second part, Gregory will briefly share his work on the preparations for the events: how, in his opinion, to make a presentation, what should be in it and what should not be in any way. <br><br>  <b>How to perform</b> <br>  In the final part, you will learn about a number of observations and techniques that can help you during your own performances.  Do I need to memorize the text?  Where exactly and how to thrust the fear of public speaking?  What if the audience is fast asleep?  Answers to these, as well as your own questions are waiting for you at the next meeting. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b5/e61/5a1/7b5e615a166a4f22a7fedac6dbe486af.jpg" align="left">  The next speaker‚Äôs speaker will be picked up by the next speaker, Alexander Shvets (Blonde.ru).  His speech will be titled: <br><br>  <b>Web analytics are big or how to use Python at the forefront</b> <br>  It's no secret that advertising has always been not only the main source of investment for the Internet, but also one of the main catalysts for the development of web technologies.  If you do not take the creative component, then everything else in modern advertising is pure mathematics.  Advertising more and more from the category of annoying banners goes into the category of convenient reference services.  She should know everything about the user, foresee his wishes.  And the main problems are the processing of a large number of requests (save each step) and huge amounts of information (combine different sources).  Python is not used in this type of task.  Often other languages ‚Äã‚Äãare used that are more productive but expensive to develop and support.  The question of why this is unfair and how to correct the situation will be raised. <br><br>  Alexander will tell you how, without having written a single line in C, you can build services to process millions of requests per second.  How to organize the postponed parsing of requests and pipeline or parallel processing.  The described technique is suitable for processing almost any action that does not require an immediate response.  Alexander will also tell you what, at what stage and where to store: in the file system, relational database or NoSQL-storage. <br><br>  Collected data requires not only processing, but also aggregation and consolidation, and Python is not only slow, but also voracious from memory.  Nevertheless, such tasks are on his shoulder.  How to use scientific data analysis tools in production?  Alexander will show how using simple algorithms and using pandas (Python Data Analysis Library), you can join gigabytes of data.  The nuances of data serialization and other subtle points will be considered. <br><br>  In conclusion, it will be possible to talk about why this is all needed: how you can use the data for practical purposes, where you can go further.  And also the topic of programmatic buying will be affected a bit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dfa/7ab/a77/dfa7aba77a794039bcae54d1540425dd.jpg" align="left">  And the last of the three speakers will be Sergey Likhobabin (Mail.Ru Group).  Sergey will share his knowledge and experience in a report entitled: <br><br>  <b>Managing Access Rights to Django Objects</b> <br><ul><li>  access rights at the object level, why they are needed, what solutions exist, the main problems; </li><li>  our decision and its possibilities, examples from life; </li><li>  access restrictions in hierarchies of objects of various types. </li></ul><br>  Often in our applications it is required to restrict user access to an object.  But this seemingly trivial task over time acquires a huge amount of nuances and problems that cannot be solved with the help of the standard rights model.  How to show a patched list of objects, taking into account the visibility for each user and not losing performance?  What to do in the case of complex hierarchies of nested objects?  How to give rights to view or change a single object to users from a particular city or subdivision? <br><br>  I will tell you how we solved these and other problems of managing rights and visibility of objects and how our solution can be useful in your project. <br><br>  To participate in the meeting it is necessary to <a href="http://moscowdjango.timepad.ru/event/141781/">register</a> .  An <a href="http://corp.mail.ru/stream/MoscowDjangoMeetup/">online broadcast</a> will also be available. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235227/</a></p>
