"  I promise him - exceptionally culturally and patiently - to contact the support services of ChronoPay and the emitter bank (and the court). </li><li>  April 10 - a month later - I write to the ChronoPay support service. </li><li>  On April 11, at 2:48 local time, I received an email from the ChronoPay support service: ‚Äú <i>We sent a request for a refund to the administration of the store where the purchase was made.</i>  <i>Within 48 hours they will make a decision and inform you and our company about it</i> . ‚Äù </li><li>  Already after 26 minutes after that, at 3 hours 14 minutes past night, they call me on a cell phone from Skype for the technical support of ProSkater.ru and say that they have been waiting for a whole month for, and when I send them a <s>passport photo by</s> mail, I misunderstood asleep, and I had to send a photo of a refund <a href="http://www.proskater.ru/files/Zayavlenie-vozvrat.doc">application filed</a> by hand. </li></ul>  <b>Update</b> : <br><ul><li>  On April 12, a letter arrives in my e-mail: ‚Äú... <i>Due to the fact that you were not previously informed about the need for a written application for a refund, our management made it possible to instantly transfer money to your card</i> ...‚Äù.  Also from the letter it becomes clear that the leadership has read this post. </li><li>  April 13, I send the card / account details, on the same day I get the money back on the card.  Thanks, Habrahabr! </li></ul>  <b>Total</b> : the money was returned to me exactly one month later.  Plus, in all letters from info@proskater.ru, Gmail now shows me this contextual advertising: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7dd/ce6/35e/7ddce635eb43a821e5dc85e31939bda5.png" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><hr><br>  I live in a small city, very far from Moscow, so I often have to shop at online stores.  Not because it is convenient and fast (‚Äúregular‚Äù mail delivery from Moscow takes three to four weeks, and rarely comes intact), but because this is the only way to buy something different from pirated MP3 collections, blue jeans and standardized black ones. shoes for guys with a wide gathering, collapse of legs.

      So when I decided to buy myself a second pair of skate shoes (last summer I was convinced that this was the most comfortable shoe in the world), I used to type ‚Äú <a href="http://www.proskater.ru/">http://www.proskater.ru/</a> ‚Äù in the address bar - I was recommended at one time This shop is local skateboarders, and last time there were no problems with it. <br><br>  This time, my order issued on March 11 and immediately prepaid with a bank card was canceled the next day - due to the lack of this shoe, the size I needed in stock.  Familiar to other online stores situation, a five percent discount on the next order - no cause for concern. <br><br>  During the correspondence with the support service in the person of Ilya Kuznetsov, I was offered two options for further developments: <br><ol><li>  Making a loan on the site, equal to the amount spent by me. </li><li>  Return money by postal order. </li></ol>  Since the first option did not suit me for some reason (it is difficult to find other decent sneakers for the same money ...), it was decided to stop at the second. <br><br>  And here it began. <br><br>  In short: so far - and today is April 11, that is, exactly a month has passed - I have not received any money back.  During this time, I applied to the ProSkater.ru support service twice more (March 22 and April 5), both times I was told that ‚Äú <i>Mail transfers are sent once a week on Wednesdays, and they go about a week.</i>  <i>As soon as we send you a transfer, you will receive a notification in the mail</i> . ‚Äù  Do I need to clarify that I have not received any money or notification of their departure? <br><br>  The business moved from a dead end only after I wrote to the support service of ChronoPay - a processing company that allows ProSkater.ru to accept bank cards for payment ... <br><br>  Here you need to make a lyrical digression.  The fact is that in the ProSkater.ru settings there is a field in which the buyer can specify a convenient time to call him on the cellular.  About this field, the following dialogue took place between me and the same Ilya Kuznetsov: <br>  - By the way, on <a href="http://www.proskater.ru/account_edit.php">this</a> page, in the item ‚ÄúChoose the most convenient time to call you‚Äù indicate Moscow time?  And then seven hours of difference - I would not like to receive notification of the postal transfer in the middle of the night.  :) <br>  - No, you must specify the local time. <br><br>  ... And today, on the night from Saturday to Sunday, after I had drunk pretty badly I returned from my cousin's thirty-year anniversary and fell asleep, but before I got out of bed and went on a Sunday hunt on Sunday ... well, three o'clock in the morning I am woken up by a cellular call, and they inform me that I need to scan my passport and send it along with my application for a refund to the support service e-mail.  And that I should have been informed about this in the support service, and that the staff of ProSkater.ru day and night, for a month, waited courageously for me to do this, ready to rush to send me money at any second. <br><br><hr>  <b>Update</b> : <br><br>  Two days after the publication of this post on the main Habrahabr, they returned the money to me, and not by mail order, but to the card.  An approximate comment from the online store support service: ‚Äú <i>This situation arose due to the fact that you did not receive an application for a money transfer, but that you were not informed of the need for such a written statement is our fault, sorry-sorry</i> .‚Äù <br><br>  Special thanks to the commentators who advised not to wait for the weather from the sea anymore, and - until a month has passed - to go complain to the bank. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90629/</a></p>
