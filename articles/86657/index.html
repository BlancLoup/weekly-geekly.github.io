      I thought about the new assistant ‚Äúfor my own needs‚Äù (and not for the needs of the corps) very soon and just recently assembled.  Today I will talk about the throes of the <b><a href="http://www.xfxforce.com/ru/products/graphiccards/200series/285GTX.aspx">XFX 285GTX</a></b> video card, which was chosen as the basis for the new compic video system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd9/98e/1a7/dd998e1a756e13b2e876af65badf1d5a.png" alt="image">  I chose her only for one reason - sufficient performance for me at an adequate price (at least I did not want to overpay for 295), more or less modern architecture (if needed, it will be possible to buy the second such vidyuhi in SLI and certainly enough for a couple of years) .  I made conclusions about ‚Äúsufficient performance‚Äù from reviews and tests on other sites - after the purchase I was satisfied with everything.  Although no - the only thing that did not suit me was the noise of the standard cooling system (there is a turbine) of the video card under load conditions.  No, it's all right - for most people, this noise level will be very comfortable ... but since  I often work at night, I really didn‚Äôt want to interfere with the child‚Äôs sleep, all the more so if we solve the problem.  And then I was not ready psychologically to ITS. <br><br>  Very soon, I seriously thought about buying an alternative cooling system - the final reason was an interesting <a href="http://www.fcenter.ru/online.shtml%3Farticles/hardware/cooling/26553">article</a> on the Fentre about the <b>Accelero XTREME GTX 280 system</b> from <b>Arctic Cooling</b> .  Judging by the tests, despite three (!) Installed on a large radiator cooler, it worked much quieter than the standard system, while cooling an order of magnitude more confident. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d87/560/a5a/d87560a5a025abd46271c3d2b9a915e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  They wrote so beautifully what it was I wanted.  He caught fire and began to search. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/acd/379/589/acd3795895380630b639e0486185f5f4.png" alt="image">  About the first stage of the development of events, I inconspicuously <a href="http://www.dinkypage.com/51147">wrote</a> on Twitter, but due to the continuation of the story I decided to make this post on Habr√©.  Briefly about the first part - I drove in the search for the name of the system I needed and quite accidentally saw one store in the results, with a very attractive price (about 2500r, while the cooler was sold everywhere for 3500-4000).  I will not hide it - it was a <b><a href="http://www.coolerok.ru/">Coolerok</a></b> store, having entered it, I began to look for a trick spot.  No website design, ‚Äúon-the-knee in notepad‚Äù layout, prices are low, but the <a href="">reviews</a> on Yandex.market are entirely positive.  First thoughts were about cheating and samopiare, but, realizing that I was not losing anything, I made an order.  Along the way, I ordered thermopaste and a set of small radiators from the Thermaltake company - the review stated that the staff did not hold.  The call came after a minute, confirmed the order - despite the middle of the second half of the day, the device was brought to my dense Moscow suburbs that evening.  I was very pleased / surprised, then with a clear conscience <a href="">dashed off a</a> flattering review. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a48/427/eff/a48427eff2bbd416e812700bbda16916.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  End of beginning </h2><br>  But then it all started.  Reading the review, I completely ignored the fact that there the cooler was considered using the 260 GTX video card as an example.  There was, of course, the line ‚Äú <i>intended for the installation and cooling of NVIDIA GeForce GTX 260‚Äî285 graphics cards</i> , but ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/889/9cb/da6/8899cbda622545f53c16dd40e93c3e06.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c45/fea/e13/c45feae13cd745c1a4fe5a3d2bd112dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3bb/30d/8d2/3bb30d8d2561262c934ec8bb91aab10a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/444/087/3ea/4440873ead2a69efa9095b28fb52cb9b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/607/b2e/111/607b2e1114a6b8cc7d0bf7af16db63b7.png" alt="image">  ... when I started to install, it turned out that some parts do not fit, suddenly a couple extra were left, and the radiator outsole was significantly smaller than the heat distribution cover) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ebe/5b3/f3c/ebe5b3f3c13446e89dc8347092cd0890.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/852/76a/1b8/85276a1b84d2f0ed64826242d9a666cb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/19b/739/42d/19b73942df2b4c552f76b1e3003a27d7.png" alt="image">  Where ours disappeared - with a file and not this can be installed.  In other matters, small radiators were really useful - regular ones from the Accelero kit were suggested to be mounted on some kind of thermoplastic materials that were not kept at all.  When heated, probably, they would have stuck ... but after all, it was also necessary to turn on it, until everything fell off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/877/845/5b0/8778455b08594c7ca9a1a8c531fcc689.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/770/227/a84/770227a842fb08616f6fe49f0e77240d.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b8/46d/94a/3b846d94aeb4c41476930d4127ce839b.png" alt="image">  In general, I am both right and that - even at 100% fan speed (the speed can be adjusted manually), in the load I had more than 100 degrees on the GPU, which should not be.  I had to continue working on the media center, and the emerging problem was solved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d6a/02d/11e/d6a02d11e6f1632704cff7cc6debe805.png" alt="image">  At first I asked around familiar overclockers - the versions were very different.  Later it turned out that there was an insufficient pressure of the radiator against the lid of the GPU - the metal braces of the cooler interfered in the frame around the graphics processor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b81/b06/caf/b81b06cafb3eb492e97f1508a3804a35.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c14/4aa/f36/c144aaf369f48eab70007c0d8d14b919.png" alt="image">  <b>Donny</b> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/occlub/blog/84281/">was the</a> closest thing to the truth then, but installing a rather heavy cooler on a printed circuit board without a support frame (it is removed) is too sycophant.  Yes, and it was almost obvious that the system would not survive due to the iron-and-steel materials - these photos will not convey these observations. <br><br><h2>  Beginning of the End </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee3/317/f75/ee3317f75fcacd57886fff1f55b04a89.png" alt="image">  Hands did not fall - began to study the manufacturer's website, manuals.  It turned out that the system is suitable for 280 inclusive, and for 285 and above, the <b><a href="http://arcticcooling.com/catalog/product_info.php%3FcPath%3D2_%26mID%3D251">Accelero XTREME GTX Pro</a></b> system was offered.  Which in Russia was nowhere, because  she just got out.  I began to bomb the manufacturer and distributors by mail, it turned out that "it is about to be on sale".  I decided to postpone the file and wait a week to buy a guaranteed compatible unit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8de/fad/60f/8defad60f176870b1cee979adb6ee9ba.png" alt="image">  By the way, I was pleasantly surprised - he first appeared in the same cooler (and at the moment it is sold only in two stores).  I really didn‚Äôt want to spend another couple thousand to buy almost the same cooling system - I wrote to them, they say, and so.  Invited to his Scoop.  It turned out that the world is small - it was a small pavilion, next to the pavilion, where the world famous overclocker <b><a href="http://dedal.habrahabr.ru/">DeDaL worked</a></b> .  Accordingly, the people in the topic - it became clear where they got the new items and why such a low price, why the site is so harsh (there is simply no person for it).  But the most pleasant thing - I agreed to change my cooling system for a new (compatible) for free, because  mine, in fact, was new.  For that from the heart - THANK YOU.  As a thank you, I bought two radiator boxes for hard drives from Himuro. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/001/8ab/d86/0018abd864f2854b0e9d6222591799bd.png" alt="image">  After a couple of minutes, the cooler was installed and tested personally by DeDaL, for which he, too, personally thanks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4ee/cc2/c5e/4eecc2c5e00d6c71ea613b41831b2b73.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/754/f10/baf/754f10baff4e38385d6819440bce8891.png" alt="image">  This time everything came up, taking into account the specifics of the PCB layout.  There were radiators on the memory, on the power circuit and on something else there.  The footprint of the radiator is still smaller than the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe heat distribution cover, but as it is. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/286/bb9/2a6/286bb92a662ad4041b625a6bd7e1aebb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b45/1a7/c5c/b451a7c5c95759213684d6bdc54540d1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5e7/b87/0f9/5e7b870f927c5bbc60d82e2b131c0213.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the most powerful Furmark video test, 40% of the coolers capacity, the temperature was ... I don't remember exactly which one, but the control of the specialist passed.  Now in idle time about 35 degrees, while in the load - not more than 60 (for the standard system, these figures are approximately 55 and 85 degrees, respectively).  Well, the noise from the work, judging by the specs, is less by a factor of 5, although this is false.  Noticeably quieter, yes, but you can still hear.  By the way, a little later, from the manufacturer‚Äôs website, information about the Accelero 280 GTX cooler was removed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/55b/977/607/55b9776071585a3cb24033bcf047518c.png" alt="image">  In general, everything worked - as it should, as desired.  Initially, vidyuha from XFX looks great and very compact, but the new cooler is elegant in its own way.  For the price in total, it was slightly less than the cost of 295GTX, but if necessary, it would be possible to buy a second 285 - for two, 295 the wife would have killed for sure) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/41d/b64/4ab/41db644abc624c3379d47ee8448595ee.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Although still do not leave thoughts like ‚Äú <i>Damn, why did I even started it all ?!</i>  <i>After all, it worked, buzzed, cooled, and only the money was spent and the people strained</i> . ‚Äù  But how nice it is now to work on a new computer.  I occasionally get to work on the machines of a wide variety of configurations - from netbooks to gaming computers, but all this is coming and going, and to assemble a computer for myself, with a soul, is completely different.  Compare after the old computer (with integrated video) performance gains, to feel all this in almost all actions - none of the devices will give this to the full.  OS loading, file operations, toys, photoshop - yes, it all worked! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/350/7e2/b94/3507e2b94cfe99f1b97f26438e80a678.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cf3/518/c0f/cf3518c0fb3dfab6139a34966859ecbd.png" alt="image">  Such is the story.  I made some conclusions for myself: <br><br>  - Initially vidyuha from XFX is good.  And while it works, it is better not to touch it; <br>  - I will carefully read what they write in the articles; <br>  - I will carefully read twice what is written in specs and manuals; <br>  - The file should be close - sometimes it can be useful; <br>  - Still, ITS would be more efficient and quieter, but more expensive; <br>  - Sometimes reviews on this Yandex.Market can be trusted, and paranoia is evil; <br>  - It is silly to draw conclusions about the online store by its appearance. <br><br>  In fact, I dug a hole to myself - I created a problem, aggravating my own carelessness.  But there was also an unpleasant inaccuracy on the Fentre - in other matters, which of us is not mistaken. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/180/fcf/081/180fcf08131bc79cfb33e8017c63e0a7.png" alt="image">  Once again, a special thank you to the <a href="http://www.coolerok.ru/">Coolerok</a> store for going to the meeting and for working smoothly, like a Kalashnikov machine gun - you can trust them with the purchase of cooling systems.  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/occlub/blog/">Overclockers</a> thanks for the tips, hints and sensitive control :) <br><br>  Be careful.  I hope the new features will be useful not only for me. <br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86657/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86657/</a></p>
