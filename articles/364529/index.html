Epson device overview for geeks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The outgoing 2014 was rich in all sorts of new products, many of which will be of particular interest to those of us who are used to using unusual and useful devices and technologies in our lives. In the outgoing year, a new device for the company appeared in the Epson range: <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-200/">Epson Moverio</a> video augmented reality <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-200/">glasses BT-200</a> and <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/runsense/">GPS watch Epson Runsense</a> . <br><br>  In this post, we tried to make a list of Epson devices that, in our opinion, are perfect for the role of a New Year's gift to a modern geek (and not only). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31a/a4a/61a/31aa4a61a1c445508636676ebfc2d61e.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  Epson MoverioBT-200 Augmented Reality Glasses </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8dd/8b2/a72/8dd8b2a7272647e69fa820df30905615.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-200/">Epson Moverio BT-200</a> is augmented reality binocular video <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-200/">glasses</a> that create a bright image that is visually located in the center of the field of view and is similar to an approximately 80-inch screen viewed from 5 meters.  The projected image is superimposed on what the viewer sees, which allows the use of glasses for augmented reality, and when installing special dimmers, the device becomes video glasses for standard entertainment, such as games and video viewing.  There is also a stereoscopic mode, i.e.  You can watch movies and play games in 3D!  For a better understanding of the features of the device, we suggest watching the video: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WXiriCV3NNY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiTkoFM827UtRkcp97Uhw5km9cJyA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Due to the small size of the BT-200, it is convenient to take on various trips, while ensuring complete privacy of viewing. <br><br>  And that is not all.  The glasses themselves are crammed with various sensors: they track the head tilt along all axes, position in space (using GPS, accelerometer and compass), the camera allows you to work with augmented reality markers and even receive input with gestures.  All this is vital for various tasks related to augmented reality.  Plus, wireless video transmission via Miracast, USB OTG support (you can connect a joystick or keyboard, for example), micro SD card support up to 32 GB, Bluetooth 3.0 ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cbd/93e/17b/cbd93e17b734482ea24853684c027603.jpg"><br><br>  Certified for BT-200 applications are laid out in a special store Epson Moverio Apps Market, however, practice has shown that a number of third-party Android applications launch on the device as well.  Points are running the popular Android operating system 4th version. <br><br>  <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/moverio/epson-moverio-bt-200/">Epson Moverio BT-200</a> is an amazing innovative device that will be an excellent gift for a real geek. <br><br><h2>  Epson Runsense GPS Watch </h2><br>  Soon the chimes will strike twelve, and the festive Olivier will be eaten.  For someone, another time will come a new "sport" period in life.  Recall some popular ways to get back into shape: <br><br><ul><li>  jogging or walking in the morning; </li><li>  ski and snowboard; </li><li>  a bicycle (a bicycle in winter ?! And why not?). </li></ul><br>  However, intentions to go in for sports are not enough: you need to somehow track the results! <br><br>  For this purpose, Epson offers a special wearable device: <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/runsense/">the Epson Runsense GPS watch</a> .  During jogging or riding, they sit comfortably on the hand, have extremely precise positioning, largely due to the use of a built-in accelerometer, which adapts to the style of the wearer's run.  For the same reason, the clock continues to work when the GPS signal is lost.  In addition, when GPS is turned on, the clock runs for about 30 hours from a single battery charge! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a9/008/0a4/6a90080a43c548d6a02f783a21d4ef1b.jpg"><br><br>  Returning home, the user synchronizes the statistics of hours with various applications and rejoices his success time after time! <br><br>  You can learn more about the watch from the video or by <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/runsense/">following this link</a> : <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/hj37p9hgGGg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhjhISACD4SYdi3h1UKokqtTfuGoA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Epson Home Projectors </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/261/ad3/432/261ad3432f1940fdbcbed2e03dd8378c.jpg"><br><br>  Why not please yourself or your friends and family by purchasing a <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/proj-home/">projector</a> ?  It's time to create your own cinema with the image of a diagonal of 80, 100 ... 130 and even 300 inches at home!  The lack of preparation of the premises, the absence of blackout - this is no longer an excuse.  The brightness of our projectors is enough to demonstrate the picture and on the unprepared wall, and the proprietary <a href="http://epson.ru/3lcd/">technology 3LCD</a> , thanks to the high efficiency of working with the luminous flux, ensures that this brightness does not go to the detriment of the quality of <a href="http://epson.ru/technology/projection/1073630/">color rendering</a> .  And the color rendition of our projectors hoo! <br><br>  To create your home cinema there will be a rather large white matte surface (even a wall will do) and a 3LCD projector, for example, such as <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw5200/">Epson EH-TW5200</a> or <a href="http://epson.ru/catalog/projectors/epson-eh-tw6600/">Epson EH-TW6600</a> .  These are superb full HD projectors delivering a bright and juicy picture. <br><br>  Epson EH-TW5200: 3D entry-level projector with a special mode for video games, excellent 3D image quality, support for connecting to mobile devices via MHL, etc. By the way, reviewers from the Rozetked YouTube channel recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dfuk7RDitNmk%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">reviewed this particular model</a> and had a projector to the soul <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b02/2d2/e91/b022d2e91ab740149f726a7b1a5424e8.jpg"><br><br>  Epson EH-TW6600: a mid-level model designed primarily for watching movies in 2D and 3D.  The projector has a very high contrast - 70000: 1, i.e.  black remains black even in complete darkness.  In addition, the model boasts the presence of an enhanced color palette mode (allows you to get cleaner, more saturated colors than the Blu-Ray standard requires).  The "lens shift" feature allows you to set the projector with an offset from the center of the screen without loss of quality, and the "Super Resolution" technology enhances the perceived sharpness of the picture when watching, for example, DVD movies. <br><br>  Learn more about Epson home projectors <a href="http://www.epson.ru/catalog/proj-home-3d/">at our website</a> . <br>  <b>By the way, until December 31, there is a <a href="http://www.epson.ru/actions/home/vi-promo-2014-ru/">New Year's action</a> - when buying Epson projectors - lamps and 3D glasses as a gift!</b> <br><br><h2>  Cloud Printing </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0d/7e0/817/b0d7e08174d44bbda01e686367c8ff15.jpg"><br><br>  It seems that a <a href="http://www.epson.ru/catalog/inkjet-home/">printer or an MFP</a> is a trivial thing and certainly is not the lot of the elect, and will not impress anyone if I start now about the print quality of Epson devices or cost effectiveness ... But the area that many users have not yet used is 100% All kinds of networking features supported by a number of Epson printers and MFPs: <br><br><ul><li>  Sending documents and images to print by e-mail (the so-called "cloud printing") </li><li>  Printing from anywhere in the world via the Internet using a remote printer driver </li><li>  Wireless printing and scanning of documents from iOS and Android devices </li></ul><br>  Perhaps, for many users, the practical use of these items would mean saving time and nerves when printing and preparing documents.  Learn more about Epson Connect, as well as find devices that support it, <a href="http://epson.ru/technology/printing/963606/">on our website</a> . <br><br><h2>  Epson LabelWorks LW-400 Ribbon Printers </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/400/4d6/7c0/4004d67c00da4fcd97c552cbb4453adb.jpg"><br><br>  A great device for those who love order in everything.  With <a href="http://www.epson.ru/catalog/printers/epson-labelworks-lw-400/">Epson LabelWorks LW-400,</a> you can quickly and conveniently make labels for wires, sign boxes and spare parts boxes, personalize your gadgets, draw up a card file and do many other useful things.  The device supports tapes 6, 9, 12 and 18 mm wide.  Since <a href="http://www.epson.ru/catalog/label-print/">Epson ribbon printers</a> are based on thermal printing technology and do not require ink, 9m tape cassettes are the only consumable.  The printer runs on both mains and AA batteries, making it completely portable. <br><br>  By the way, this is a gift for the whole family: your mother (or a friend of a geek‚Äôs friend) will surely want to make stickers for boxes with needlework, father - to mark cans with screws and nuts, and grandmother - to sign cans with blanks.  So stock up on tapes for future use! <br><br><h2>  Holiday greetings! </h2><br>  On behalf of Epson, we wish you a Happy New Year!  Separately, I would like to congratulate those who always strive to be on the crest of the technological wave and are interested in the most advanced inventions.  For such people, the Epson company creates new gadgets from year to year.  We strive to bring the future closer, about which science fiction writers wrote and made films in Hollywood.  Give yourself and your loved ones the most advanced Epson devices and tomorrow will come a little bit earlier! <br><br>  <b>Happy New Year, dear geeks!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364529/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364529/</a></p>
