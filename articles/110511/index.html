      I decided to write this post not only to tell you what you would know about yourself.  I want to develop this topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Facebook started out as a regular social network, which eventually evolved into a personal operating environment, where information and people who can come from outside the Facebook sphere interact.  And you are the center of this complex system.  Facebook is a convenient platform where people can communicate among themselves on the three principles of information commerce.  Sharing and ‚Äúconsuming‚Äù information in social media is a modern way of communicating and educating everyone involved in this process.  But for now only on Facebook you can develop your own social architecture.  Dropping various links, information, blogs, etc. into one social space, you create an environment in which you and other participants are united by mutual interests. <br><br>  More than a million websites around the world are somehow integrated into the Facebook platform. <br><br>  150 million users per month use Facebook to communicate on other Internet resources. <br><br>  Two thirds of the websites from the US ranking and half the websites from the global comScore ranking are integrated with Facebook. <br><br>  The more we engage in communication (by clicking the ‚ÄúLike‚Äù, ‚ÄúRecommend‚Äù, ‚ÄúComment‚Äù buttons) on the web using Facebook, the greater social impact our websites have and the more we personalize our personal space on Facebook and on these sites. <br><br>  According to comScore statistics, the number of visitors to Facebook in October 2010 increased by 55.2%, having jumped from 97.4 million visitors in October last year to 151.1 million this year. <br><br>  It is also important to mention that on Facebook last year there were 300 million active users, and this year already 550 million. Attendance of Google in the US alone reaches 173.3 million people, but the trajectory of the number of Facebook visitors is gaining mass, strength and inertia ... <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Every day, 50% of active users log in to your Facebook account. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The average Facebook user has 130 contacts. <br>  ‚Ä¢ On average, people chatting on Facebook spend 700 billion minutes a month. <br><br><h4>  I do not need to "google", it is better to "facebook" </h4><br><br>  Over the past years, Google has failed to establish its own social network.  Probably because the company is fixated on the culture of the code, instead of deciphering the culture of human behavior. <br><br>  Apparently, in the future we are waiting for the war of giants for social profiles.  Judging by the efforts Facebook is making, in order to divert you from Google towards social media, this war has already begun.  The option of adding a Facebook homepage will surely attract even more active users around the world.  Let's see how much this social network will make its starting point for access to the Internet. <br><br>  Such a seemingly small step will greatly affect our behavior and will teach us to trust friends more if we want to learn something, get support or just have fun. <br><br>  To get inspiration, we turn to the flow, not Google ... <br><br>  Those events that are unfolding before our eyes - this is perhaps the beginning of the end of the dominance of Google in the global network.  This is the rise of the Facebook economy (F-commerce), where commerce is expressed in the currency of information, involvement and equity of human relations.  While Facebook does not publicly announce its superiority, it simply helps to communicate, learn new things and share interesting things with friends.  While you enjoy being at the center of your social egosystem, Facebook simply continues to develop products and services that make this system more efficient. <br><br>  <b>From Gmail to Facebook.com</b> &gt; Now we are working on a new message system <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/facebook/" class="user_link">facebook</a> .com, which will change our idea of ‚Äã‚Äãemail, taking us to the world of Zuckerberg's fantasies.  Integrating mail into one system and connecting diverse email clients will gradually nullify Google Talk.  For some reason, while we do not hear about the response step of Google, which makes attempts to redirect all 193 million Gmail users to a social network, say, GoogleMe.  And here, when social innovations are added to MySpace, Google simply has no choice but to humanize its algorithms. <br><br>  <b>From Google.com to Facebook Search</b> &gt; The future of search engines will be more social and, therefore, we are already investing in social media optimization (SMO), and not just in SEO.  Don't underestimate the new Facebook search.  Google has long dominated the search, but now we see that this system is imperfect and is beginning to become obsolete.  And while Google is trying to integrate the social and traditional aspects of search, their algorithms must humanize to an even greater degree.  And Facebook is slowly but surely improving its search function.  If earlier we received results only from the local network, now we have access to the entire Internet and this advanced search is formed based on the actions of your friends.  By the way, Facebook search will be further improved and expanded in the coming months. <br><br>  <b>From Google Voice to Facebook + Skype</b> &gt; Google Voice is a great service that combines voice, email and the Internet.  Despite the fact that competitors still do not attract too much attention to this event, but calls to Facebook friends can be made via Skype directly from News Feed soon.  Such integration occurs as if by itself, in response to emerging demand.  I think it will take a little time and these two services will soon become full-fledged competitors of Google Voice. <br><br>  <b>From Google Latitude to Facebook Places</b> &gt; Google is experimenting with the user's geographical location, but Facebook Places is already gaining popularity.  Fighting for the attention of users in online and offline modes, Facebook knows how to combine experience and send users to the News Feed. <br><br>  <b>From Google Groups to Facebook Groups</b> &gt; Google Groups used to be the best host of topic groups that are united by common interests, events and problems.  Now after the release of improved Facebook Groups, people can create niches and networks within networks.  This goal-oriented activity is supported by group infrastructure and combines business with pleasure.  It does not matter which links unite the group, weak, strong or temporary. <br><br>  <b>From Google Docs to Facebook + Microsoft Office</b> &gt; Google Docs has already become the standard business model for exchanging documents, spreadsheets, presentations, forms, and even art canvases.  But since the world is already talking about Facebook mail service, Microsoft decided to introduce Office Web Apps and integrate this office into a new mail system.  As a result of this technical alliance, users will be able to view documents in Word, Excel, PowerPoint without leaving Facebook.  I think the collaboration between Facebook and Microsoft is just beginning ... <br><br><h4>  Tweet this to me ... Facebook generation </h4><br><br>  And what about Twitter?  I think this is a moon that orbits a planet called networking.  It affects the ebb and flow, and also determines the speed of rotation of the planet. <br><br>  Twitter is your window to current events, and Facebook is your homepage in the world of social networking. <br><br>  According to recent Hitwise data, Facebook accounts for 25% of all web views in the United States.  And this trend will intensify as we increasingly trust Facebook.  So far, in all that concerns the search, Google is the undisputed leader. But Hitwise believes that Facebook has already overtaken Google in the number of views.  In my previous posts, I wrote that according to comScore, Facebook is coming Google on the heels.  In any case, the shift of traffic from Google towards Facebook is just a matter of time. <br><br>  At the moment we are witnessing the birth of social consumers, therefore, the choice of the future will most likely be for Facebook. <br><br>  As I summarized earlier, emails are no longer a means.  The tool in social media is the platform, as well as its participants.  People are now both a means and a subject of communication, and boundaries are designated by a social profile, context and quality of connections, which, as we have said, can be strong, weak and temporary.  The Facebook platform serves as the basis for our own social environment in which we act as a driving force.  Every our action meets equal opposition.  As part of the social environment, we begin to understand that using Facebook gives our social profile a greater push than if we relied solely on Google. <br><br>  Welcome to the Facebook generation!  Have you already made Facebook your homepage? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110511/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110511/</a></p>
