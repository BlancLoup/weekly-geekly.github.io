Only in the last few weeks, the company added the ability to automatically correct images when uploading to Google+, launched a network of balloons to provide access to the Internet in places with poorly developed infrastructure, opened access to a new music subscription service and updated the map service. <br><br>  But as long as the company reports on the latest revenues and achievements, investors are only interested in one thing - indicators of revenues from contextual advertising of the company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Among all the innovations of Google, the search service remains one of the most reliable sources of revenue for the company.

      In June, more than 90% of search queries on computers and more than 92% of queries on mobile devices in the UK came from Google.  Any company could envy these numbers.  At the same time, in the US market, the average percentage is below the average and is about 78%.  There are problems in the markets of China, Russia and South Korea. <br><br>  For a long time, Google search service remained the best of its kind.  The company has invested a lot of money in the implementation of search services and in its mobile platform, thus ensuring leadership in the near future. <br><br>  Today it is hard to imagine who can seriously compete with Google, except for the services of Russia and Asian countries, which are investing serious forces in search engines and systems. <br><br>  But even in this situation, other companies are trying to create a competitive product, offer different search capabilities, or even try to use completely different principles of building and operating a search engine. <br><br><h4>  Bing </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3a8/0df/540/3a80df54006300aba731bb5088ea53c5.png"><br><br>  Microsoft's <a href="http://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> search engine is Google's leading competitor when looking at the search market as a whole.  But at the same time the share of Bing is less than the twentieth of all search queries. <br><br>  The most noticeable difference from Google is the use of Bing-oh colorful photos as the background of the start page.  Of course, this is only a visual difference and nothing more. <br><br>  Microsoft is experimenting with social opportunities.  In addition to the search results, Bing users in the United States have access to an additional panel that offers their friends from Facebook who in turn may possibly provide more information or help with the search. <br><br>  Bing is also working on a ‚Äúboards‚Äù service that will allow users to independently create ‚Äúhighly specialized content‚Äù for search results. <br><br><h4>  Yandex </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df9/181/57b/df918157bf978761f64ec80d3d978355.png"><br><br>  The most popular Russian search engine.  The company is now working on introducing a new approach to displaying search results called ‚Äúislands‚Äù, in which the answers are interactive blocks, which in turn are designed to eliminate the need to switch to external resources. <br><br>  Thus, the user will be able to solve the problem right on the search page.  For example, the search ‚Äúaeroflot registration Moscow‚Äù will show in the results a form in which the user will enter their details and send directly to the airline. <br><br><h4>  Duckduckgo </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/255/571/dff/255571dffe2cc062104ec20e17e8ffaa.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> highlights privacy as a key feature, promising not to collect or use the personal information of its users. <br><br>  This problem became relevant after the discovery of the fact that Google, Microsoft and others sent data about users to the US National Security Agency.  DuckDuckGo also does not sin with the volume of advertising and does not personalize the search results. <br><br><h4>  Blippex </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f83/fa2/604/f83fa2604b2d3cc0f6fa00bc5354f2e6.png"><br><br>  Most search engines base their ranking of results on content analysis and links between pages. <br><br>  The <a href="https://www.blippex.org/">Blippex</a> search engine also orders the results based on their DwellRank - the amount of time users have spent on the page since they hit it.  The more time they spent on the page, the more important the information is considered. <br><br>  The service obtains the necessary information by installing an extension by users, which anonymously sends information about the activity. <br><br>  Blippex was launched last week and first users sometimes notice unexpected results, but the developers promise that the more users use the service, the better the results. <br><br><h4>  Wolfram alpha </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bd3/350/d18/bd3350d180a9dc5c24c14095f4cea62d.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/">Wolfram Alpha</a> does not position itself as a search engine, but as a knowledge base and a set of computational algorithms.  Although many users still use the service to search for external information. <br><br>  The service, instead of providing links to other sites, collects facts and figures from various sources and then operates with these data to display the search results in the form of tables, graphs and other illustrations. <br><br>  WolframAlpha provides an extended paid service package that allows users to process their own data and promises more extensive information analysis. <br><br><h4>  Blekko </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0f9/c48/f36/0f9c48f36dba9c4956a9334ff0dd2b76.png"><br><br>  A characteristic feature of <a href="http://blekko.com/">Blekko</a> is the use of ‚Äúslash tags‚Äù - a tool for filtering the result that the user wants.  If, for example, a user wants to know where to buy a cake, he will often enter ‚Äúcake / shop / restaurant‚Äù, but if he wants to see articles on the topic of cake, he will enter ‚Äúcake / blog‚Äù.  Results are grouped into different categories, such as purchases, recipes, decorations - to help the user focus on the most appropriate type of desired result. <br><br><h4>  Naver </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/feb/08e/43c/feb08e43c8a7622c10f4e5fe322e5a2d.png"><br><br>  The leading South Korean search engine was created in 1999 by a group of former Samsung employees. <br>  Requests give out unusually long lists of links grouped by the type of their source - blogs, social networks, programs, books, news <br>  Often, links lead the user to <a href="http://www.naver.com/">Naver's</a> personal content, including ‚Äúcaf√©s‚Äù - communities where users share interesting content on a specific topic. <br><br><h4>  Pipl </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ca1/600/c2a/ca1600c2ab591b40ab9b7b1c70b267d2.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://pipl.com/">Pipl</a> specializes in finding details about a particular person or his materials on the web.  The service involves the use of queries built on the name, mailing address, telephone number. <br><br>  Service developers claim that their system finds information that competitors are missing because Pipl is looking for information in social network profiles, court records, participant lists and other databases. <br><br>  The results include photos and sometimes the names of other people that the person you are looking for knows. <br>  Often the service is used to search for your own profiles and publications, which the author has forgotten over time. <br><br><h4>  Baidu </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/251/db4/237/251db4237fc2d90628ae0943972d3da5.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.baidu.com/">Baidu</a> is the most popular search engine in China.  The company declares that the service provides not only links, but often exactly the actual information that the user is looking for.  This may include music and video, and even interactive applications on the pages you are looking for. <br><br>  For a long time the service was available only in Chinese, and only recently the developers launched the English version. <br><br><h4>  Yacy </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/122/0ca/e16/1220cae16d0eb65a0db7d95c91ca5ed7.png"><br><br>  <a href="http://yacy.net/en/index.html">Yacy</a> is based on the peer-to-peer network.  Instead of using its own servers to index sites, he assigns this task to the computers of his users with the help of special software. <br><br>  Collected information is distributed across a common distributed database.  Since the search takes place on users' computers, Yacy claims that results are not censored. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the algorithms for ranking service results are not as advanced as those of other competitors. <br><br>  <a href="http://bbc.co.uk/news/technology-23318889">The original source bbc.co.uk</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187088/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187088/</a></p>
