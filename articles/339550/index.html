  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Uneducated youth. Life in the outback</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  In the wake of talking about education in our country in the field of IT, I also decided to tell about my history and show how things are going beyond the Urals, and more precisely in Siberia. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="nachalo">  Start </h2><br><p>  In 2014, I was finishing school in one of the depths of Siberia, choosing a specialty and university.  Having a basic knowledge of IT and programming, I knew exactly what specialties I needed.  At one of the Novosibirsk University, I liked ‚ÄúInformation Security‚Äù, without hesitation, submitted the original documents, passed in the first wave and fate led me to Novosibirsk. </p><br><h2 id="pervyy-kurs">  First grade </h2><br><p>  After the backwoods, Novosibirsk seemed like a megapolis, I thought that I would find a job in my heart and become an expert in the field of Information Security.  Couples immediately ceased to please, and after the first session, I stopped actively visiting them, trying to work in a small desk, as they say "for food."  Like all students, I comforted myself that it was only the first course that would continue to be better, but as it turned out not, and all my hopes of becoming a cool hacker flew off like a wind. </p><br><h2 id="vtoroy-kurs">  Second course </h2><br><p>  Autumn again.  In the university, nothing has changed in education, they teach couples as dull and depressing, it is not clear that it is not clear why.  Closer to winter, I found work for a decent wage, and again, without visiting a couple, I sat for days at work.  In November I learned about the program Microsoft Students Partners and filed an application with a friend.  Having become an MSP, we immediately began to speak at our university in a circle, at the same time doing different things for Microsoft.  After the New Year holidays, we were called to the summit of partner students to Moscow, and of course we agreed.  In February, he was forced to leave his job due to disagreements with his superiors.  During this time, I became acquainted with the clouds, setting up servers and networks, and also learned how to make good websites.  There was a lull. </p><br><h2 id="tretiy-kurs">  Third course </h2><br><p>  Studied again.  Once again I visited couples once and again and everything went on as usual, until my roommate offered to take part in information security competitions (CTF), and I, of course, could not refuse.  I began to attend the same club and participate in all the competitions that were.  I also had to tighten up my studies in order for the dean's office to allocate money for trips to competitions in other cities.  During the year of the competition, I pulled up possessions of linux, php, python, sql and other various technologies, and also visited Omsk and Krasnodar thanks to the university.  Also during the year I tried to get a job with a web developer, but all was unsuccessful, out of 20 resumes sent to me only one answered, sending a test task, but then disappeared.  So flew another year.  In the summer there was not a very good manufacturing practice, on which it was necessary to rewrite the serial numbers of all the computers in the hospital and arrange them beautifully. </p><br><h2 id="chetvertyy-kurs">  Fourth year in college </h2><br><p>  At the moment I am studying in the fourth year and working as a web developer or as it is fashionable now to call full stack developer.  Because of the work, you have to periodically skip pairs, but this does not affect performance.  After studying I plan to climb the career ladder and develop further. </p><br><h2 id="itog">  Total </h2><br><p>  As the saying goes, "The rescue of the drowning is the work of the drowning themselves."  If you really want to grow and develop in the field of IT, then there is a lot of information on the Internet.  There are online and offline courses, meetings and conferences, competitions and contests, there are also forums and chats in which you can be prompted and helped in your endeavor. </p><br><p>  Yet it is worth considering that we always need some groundwork, even if it is inept.  With employment this can help you a lot. </p><br><p>  And of course, share with others what you have learned.  Something like this is a circle with us, we are conducting it for ourselves and for ourselves, telling what we know and trying to learn something new.  Thank you so much to tell our young teachers, who hear us, understand these problems and somehow try to help.  They try to invite real specialists and employers to pairs, and we in turn help them to hold lectures on interesting topics. </p><br><p>  Successes to future students and specialists! </p></div>
