  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Key Override and Own Hot Keys in Windows with the ATNSOFT Key Manager</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to tell about the program ATNSOFT Key Manager.  This is a program that helps me work a little faster and be generally a little happier, because it makes my work on the computer a little more comfortable.  The program, generally speaking, is damp and has glitches, despite the version number 1.5, but having a number of useful, in my opinion, features. <a name="habracut"></a>  The program is paid.  Writing about paid programs is not fashionable, but it is cheap enough.  The functionality that it provides over time will simply pay for the cost of the program from the cost of the saved working time.  Well, the cost of time searching for alternative solutions. <br>  I have nothing to do with the development of the program.  Financially not interested, since the license has already been acquired.  Below I describe only what I use myself.  The program has other functionality. <br><br><h5>  Override buttons </h5><br>  I have a digital block on my laptop keyboard.  This is great, but I was always annoyed that in the Russian layout, press the '.'  typed comma.  Yes, from the point of view of Russian-language mathematics, this is correct, but I work as a programmer, so I often have to type IP addresses or fractional numbers in a code with a period (and not with a comma).  In windows xp I found a way to solve this problem.  With windows 7, I did not find a solution, and I did not look for it myself.  Googled a couple of times, tried the tips - it did not work.  Abandoned this venture. <br>  Key manager allowed you to configure so that by '.'  numeric keypad is always typed point.  On the other hand, even if the Num lock is off, a dot is still printed.  I thought, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use a digital keyboard with the Num lock turned off, but on the contrary, the Num lock turned off is annoying.‚Äù  And I set up that the numbers 0-9 are always printed on the keys of the numeric keypad.  I was especially pleased when I entered the PuTTY console and there, again, the numbers were typed on the numeric keypad! <br>  On the keyboard of my laptop, the Insert key is made as Fn + Delete.  Somehow it is not very convenient, given that the console constantly requires Ctrl + Insert and Shift + Insert.  Redefined combinations: Ctrl + Delete and Shift + Delete now work as Ctrl + Insert and Shift + Insert respectively.  In other combinations, the Delete key behaves as usual. <br><br><h5>  Running programs </h5><br>  The Apps key has always been one of the most useless buttons on my keyboard.  Mark it as a ‚Äúuser modifier‚Äù.  Perhaps this means that it began to work on the principle of Ctrl, Alt or Shift.  Those.  by itself, it means nothing, but changes the behavior of other buttons.  Now Apps + button (or two buttons) launch various programs for me: Apps + F, F launches Firefox, Apps + P starts puTTY, Apps + S, C - WinSCP, Apps + F, A - Far. <br>  Less programmer tasks hung on RCtrl + button: RCtrl + F - Everything, RCtrl + V - CamStudio, RCtrl + NumPad Add - create an email message. <br>  While this is all that I have appointed - get used to it.

    <h5>  Insert special characters </h5><br>  I like to add texts with special characters.  LWin + '- puts the stress, LWin + each of the cursors prints an arrow of the corresponding direction, LWin + c - adds ¬©, Lwin + Tab inserts a tab (tabulation may be needed for insertion into text fields of the browser or messenger). <br><br><h5>  Mouse </h5><br>  On my mouse there are two additional buttons (X1 and X2).  By default, they work as ‚Äúforward‚Äù.  The "forward" button is usually not needed.  But the click on the scroll on my mouse is inconvenient (the wheel rotates freely, without clicks).  Reassigned X2 as a click on the middle button. <br>  LAlt + scroll now adjusts the sound.  LAlt + Right button turns on / off the sound.  There are sound adjustment buttons on the keyboard, but it's more convenient for me to use the wheel. <br><br><h5>  Type or paste text </h5><br>  In the PuTTY console, you often have to drive in the same commands (restarting the application, displaying logs on the screen).  It is often necessary to insert sample pieces of code into the code (xhr request, call validation with error display, php placeholders tags, printout of objects from python). <br>  Key Manager can also insert text from the clipboard and type text.  Everything from the previous paragraph is now performed on the RAlt + letter. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  In my opinion, the program <a href="http://www.atnsoft.com/rus/keymanager/">ATNSOFT Key Manager is</a> quite useful, although, as I wrote at the beginning, it is not without bugs.  And it would be possible to add different other functional.  The cost is small, and updates (like) promised to give for free.  I would like to say thank you to the developers of this wonderful program and wish them continued success! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154381/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154381/</a></p>
