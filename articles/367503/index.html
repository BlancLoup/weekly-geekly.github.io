      A smart rifle is a high-tech gadget that helps the user to aim, taking into account various factors (force and direction of the wind, temperature, preemption of movement, etc.). <br>  The basic principle is that the user presses the trigger and, according to the prompts of the navigator, accompanies the target, and the rifle chooses the best moment for the shot itself.  The operating system uses Linux. <br><br>  As the operator of a smart rifle, <b>Taya Kyle</b> was chosen, the founder of the center of psychological assistance to military personnel of the Chris Kyle Frog Foundation. <br><br>  <b>Bruce Piatt</b> (Bruce Piatt), a multiple NRA champion (US National Rifle Association), who used weapons currently in use in the US Army, was chosen as a professional sniper.  Also, Bruce was allowed to use a range finder, ordinary glasses - in general, everything that is included in the standard equipment. <br><br>  The competition was held in three stages, using three types of weapons (conventional weapons, weapons of high accuracy and sniper weapons).  Stressful conditions were also created, close to the combat ones - fog, explosions, randomly moving targets were used.  The shots were made from a sitting, lying, standing, kneeling position. <br><br>  The realism of the situation was appreciated by the audience, very high, as in our days, and in military operations, and especially in special operations, preliminary thorough preparation minimizes such problems. <br><br><blockquote>  Bottom line: Taya hit <b>100% of</b> targets, Bruce - <b>58.6%</b> . </blockquote><br>  Additional totals: <br><ul><li>  TrackingPoint rifle was able to win in each individual competition, with a huge margin. </li><li>  Taya was able to hit 100% of the targets from a fully protected position (using special glasses and cameras, allow shots to be fired in such a way that the soldier‚Äôs body remains in shelter inaccessible to enemy fire), Bruce could not make a single effective shot from a fully protected position. </li></ul><br><br>  The competition produced a natural wow effect on many viewers. <br>  <b>Taya Kyle</b> says that if the army is armed with smart weapons, it will save many lives of soldiers, police officers and special units, as well as minimize incidental losses and collateral damage due to exceptional accuracy. <br>  <b>TrackingPoint</b> claims that training a professional sniper costs the army too much, and using smart weapons can reduce the cost of training fighters and excess ammunition by <i>$ 3.2 billion</i> annually.  A smart weapon is a big leap in the development of military rifle affairs. <br>  <b>John McHale</b> , the company's CEO, says that while the fleet moved from conventional ships to aircraft carriers, and the air force ranged from simple airplanes to supersonic aircraft, the infantry was still armed with cannons (meaning guns - pistols, machine guns, etc.) d.), whose last high-quality modernization was almost 100 years ago.  It's time to give them a modern weapon. <br><br>  Details of the stages (model points for the stage). <br>  Smart rifle: <br><ul><li>  M600 rifle: <b>1900</b> </li><li>  High-precision rifle M800: <b>3240</b> </li><li>  Sniper rifle XS1: <b>5000</b> </li></ul><br>  Plain rifle: <br><ul><li>  Rifle M4A1: <b>500</b> </li><li>  High Accuracy Rifle M110: <b>940</b> </li><li>  Sniper rifle M2010: <b>1640</b> </li></ul><br>  Total score on points: <br>  Ty and smart rifle: <b>10140</b> <br>  Bruce and conventional weapons: <b>3080</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://tracking-point.com/taya-kyle-wins-american-sniper-shootout">Original article (eng)</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bd/169/88d/8bd16988dfcc46609fdeae946f1c63a4.jpg"><br>  Taya Kyle, widow of Chris Kyle, one of the most accurate and authoritative snipers in the United States. <br>  Chris is also the author of the American Shooting Autobiography. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367503/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367503/</a></p>
