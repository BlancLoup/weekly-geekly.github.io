  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Matrix Powerwatch inside and out: what's new?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Matrix Powerwatch - watches that have gained fame as the first in the world that never require charging.  At the heart of the work hours is a scientific discovery with a two-century history, the Seebeck effect.  Two years ago it became something like a small revolution, because it solved one important problem - the autonomy of wearable gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3v/2m/qg/3v2mqgkxlufzvcmxjtfdh7_c0ga.jpeg"><br><br>  Today, the second version is on the way with much more advanced features: pulse, GPS and all that. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, the revolution, for which they praise the Matrix, happened a long time ago, and it‚Äôs not about the year 2003 and the film (at that time still brothers) Wachowski.  Even before 2017, several brands attempted to bring to the market similar watches.  So it is more correct to say that Powerwatch is the first to come out in such a large circulation.

      The company introduced three models at once, but in the future, for some reason, only the top version of X, a full-fledged smart watch with notifications, received almost all attention.  To date, this watch has been translated into Russian, and a few simple dials have been added to the menu.  In fact, watches fully meet the query ‚Äúsmart watches‚Äù in the classical sense: steps, calories, distance, notifications. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Sample Dials</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/33/ce/pb/33cepb__41c1pdcvjpq-r2vaoys.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1v/de/wn/1vdewndjjr-cxzjtcyyatt46uog.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  However, the year 2019 requires much more advanced solutions: the user needs additional built-in sensors, even if he does not plan to use them. <br><br>  <b>Notifications and localization</b> <br><br>  At the time of <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/medgadgets/blog/418603/">writing the first review,</a> the Matrix X display ‚Äúspoke‚Äù with the user in English, which was quickly corrected.  Now management of the model is not difficult. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Localization example</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/o5/m6/dj/o5m6dj9h3na3thtvov8l88pxu-i.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/93/z4/gl/93z4glyzuvso4mtnbc_20vbrh9u.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ks/or/uc/ksoruccupykq9kjtbmbn5jjnf8a.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dl/st/uv/dlstuvw5kampv7pu-kayafhn8-o.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w4/sv/td/w4svtd5ofibyfwhgjqmqv3v0fei.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  However, it must be admitted that the notifications themselves still come in the form of unknown characters in linguistics.  And then, as they say, and laughter, and sin.  At one time, it was logical to believe that the Russian language was not fully packed, and therefore such a difficulty arises: in any case, this was explained before in this way. <br><br>  However (this does not justify anyone, of course), but the guys in all versions of the firmware have confiscated: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Notification translation</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f7/wy/-n/f7wy-nuxdishlzggkjbphbg0cjy.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ij/x5/f4/ijx5f4yrvgsj0q1cifxalpcz9z8.png"><br></div></div><br>  Nevertheless, at the level of the idea, we still love Matrix very much, but by now it has become obvious that one idea is not selling well, and the company went on a second run, <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/smartwatch-powered-by-you-matrix-powerwatch-2">showing</a> the second version of the watch on Indiegogo, which should not be charged. <br><br>  <b>The main differences</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vy/vd/cg/vyvdcgsfrv_f_henisw1gbtwalu.gif"><br><br><ul><li>  Color display </li><li>  Heart rate monitor </li><li>  GPS </li></ul><br>  By and large, now it will be not just unique smart watches with unusual charging technology from body heat, but real competition to popular brands: having absorbed the basic desired functions, Matrix will retain an advantage - they still will not need to be charged. <br><br>  <b>How it worked before</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2r/am/us/2ramuso6bxkmajhvsnvvibrfp2w.gif"><br><br>  At the heart of the battery is the Seebeck effect, which the developers themselves explain in simple words like this: <br><blockquote>  In a thermocouple, with a temperature difference, electrons migrate from the hot side to the cold side, creating a voltage. </blockquote>  The energy that arises when the difference in degrees is enough to power the low-powered Ambiq processor, and thus no one experiences any problems with autonomy and current performance characteristics.  The thermocouple itself is not so small and occupies almost all the space under the display and the board. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yr/3t/ym/yr3tymesjrsh8omjk-yd4p0j-ti.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, its presence was also a subject of controversy: some believed that all this was deception in order to ‚Äúrecruit classes‚Äù, and in fact there is some kind of powerful CR in there.  In fact, everything inside is believable. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Matrix inside</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zd/bw/s-/zdbws-pjhl6tfd_zo9to7uaqxsg.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l5/2h/nu/l52hnude3k12rafvfxtldb4kx0q.jpeg"><br></div></div><br>  In the new version, everything will be different. <br><blockquote>  <i>A little google translate:</i> <br>  The new watches are designed using the most advanced thermoelectric and solar technologies MATRIX, which can convert the heat of your body and ambient light into energy itself. </blockquote>  In other words, it is difficult to maintain a color display with GPS and a pulse meter with one wrist force, so in the new version one more element will be added to collect solar energy. <br><br>  How it will be embodied inside, considering that now where there used to be a flat, smooth space that ensured normal contact of the case and wrist, the pulse sensor will be embedded - it is also not yet clear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5-/is/a9/5-isa9lxylmx9waynndzmxohqd4.gif"><br><br>  On the teaser, he seems to be present, but he became obviously much smaller in size.  In any case, apparently, one Peltier element on the GPS and the pulse is not enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rs/51/o7/rs51o7pr4r_hweciul66wgk1zky.png"><br><br>  <b>Subjectively: why the second version seems less interesting</b> <br><br>  Subjectively assessing Matrix Powerwatch 2, it seems that they are less competitive and less interesting.  In any case, the whole bloom of magic somehow disappears from science.  Over the past years, we have been told so much about the energy of the sun and that it feeds entire cities, that such a construction in itself seems more accessible, less exclusive. <br><br>  Ideally, I would like to see the final doped version of Matrix X with a normal dictionary in the firmware, and many of this functionality would be enough with the head. <br><br>  Nevertheless, when the campaign ends tomorrow, the Matrix team at Indiegogo will have over $ 2 million, and this is a pretty decent amount that characterizes the demand for watches.  By the way, they will also cost a bit more expensive - the most top version now is about $ 700. <br><br>  <b>As a result</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ww/lv/nj/wwlvnj9wk66recl-h98zvs8sss8.jpeg"><br><br>  First, two years later, all the contradictions that still stretched from Reddit were resolved: de-skat, all deception.  Both inside and outside the watch looks believable and all voiced elements are still on parsing. <br><br>  Secondly, it must be admitted that at the present time, according to the first version, the team has a clear bias of interest towards <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/matrix-powerwatch-x.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmatrix%26utm_campaign%3Dx">the Matrix X model</a> : here you have localization, notifications, and dials.  All other watches ( <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/matrix-powerwatch.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmatrix%26utm_campaign%3Dpowerwatch">Powerwatch</a> and <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/matrix-powerwatch-umnye-chasy-kotorye-ne-nuzhno-zarjazhat-black-ops-pack.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dmatrix%26utm_campaign%3Dblackops">Black OPS</a> ) work in English. <br><br>  Thirdly, version X with the advent of the campaign on the second clock now receives less attention, although it works to this day regularly - the only bug that has yet to be fixed in the firmware is the notification symbols. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/444488/">https://habr.com/ru/post/444488/</a></p>
