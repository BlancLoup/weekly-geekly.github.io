  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red: DVR with LDWS and other "buns" + "inside"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the beginning of last year, I did not think that the recorders were waiting for a different evolution, except for improving the quality of shooting, and the appearance of regular hybrid models with a radar detector or an action camera function.  Fortunately, there is no need to be bored, in the models of the end of the past - the beginning of this year there were at least two interesting ‚Äútricks‚Äù.  The first is the LDWS band monitoring system, the second is a warning about speed cameras via GPS.  It was decided to study both features using the example of AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red.  I haven‚Äôt been talking about the registrars of this Russian (without sarcasm) brand for a long time, and then I had the opportunity to get acquainted with the current flagship.  Some more useful information before kata - the model is shooting in Super Full HD resolution (thanks to Ambarella A7), the price is 7,090 rubles (~ $ 202).  There is a cheaper version, without GPS and an accelerometer - for 6,290 rubles (~ $ 179). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/085/bd6/0f3/085bd60f39bdbaee46b75c4ad999552e.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Just in case, I will write a few words about the brand.  AdvoCam is owned by Videomax, which "has 17 years of experience in the professional video surveillance market."  Plus "factory" in the city of Alexandrov, Vladimir region.  There, the forces of domestic engineers are developing devices, and then checking the quality of the finished product.  China remains between these two stages and serves only as an assembly shop.  A few months ago, I personally managed to ‚Äúpenetrate‚Äù to this plant, which I will try to tell you in the near future.  This is because the phrase ‚ÄúRussian brand‚Äù in the case of AdvoCam is much more correct in comparison with many umbrella brands, more precisely, their products.

    <h4>  Packing and packaging </h4><br>  Compared with the previous models, the AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red box turned out to be slightly ‚Äúcoarse‚Äù - the inscriptions in different fonts and the abundance of ‚Äústickers‚Äù do not benefit the holistic perception.  However, there are no problems with the availability of useful data - at the ends and behind they clearly explain what LDWS is, what Super Full HD is better than 1080p, and at the same time instruct on the functions of all buttons on the case.  What I personally liked the most is that there is a table of the maximum duration of the saved video depending on the size of the memory card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/214/6cb/e5d/2146cbe5de31c3e572cfbdc9c97474a2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f9f/a6b/536/f9fa6b536bfa562b9693a074c54e6908.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c7/39e/aa3/2c739eaa3f565b823bfc1dbcf65808c2.jpg"><br><br>  The internal set is typical of the latest AdvoCam recorders (but not ‚Äúgenerally‚Äù according to the market).  First, there is a 4 GB card, immediately inserted into the slot.  It holds about half an hour of shooting 1296p, 40 minutes of 1080p and one hour of 720p.  I think that selling recorders without a memory card is unacceptable, except in the case of the most affordable models.  Is 4 GB enough - a private question.  Accelerometer, for automatic tagging of important files, has not been canceled.  As well as the ability to manually assign an emergency label to the current file.  Considering that in most cases the useful video length does not exceed even one minute ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c39/ce3/33e/c39ce333ef65fda6f6fc54fa3e01b0b7.jpg"><br><br>  The charger from the cigarette lighter is not particularly pleased.  I would not pay attention to it, if it were not for AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS - it has a full-fledged USB connector in the unit, for installation on recharging other devices.  Moreover, I found the exact same useful accessory in the bundle of fresh AdvoCam-FD Black-GPS, which is positioned as the most inexpensive recorder of the current AdvoCam models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2cc/a19/ede/2cca19ede785b566e452922df938fa63.jpg"><br><br>  As I understand it, for some time now AdvoCam ‚Äúsigned‚Äù to advertise their registrars, well-known in the Russian automobile circles, Viktor Travin - the president of the board of legal protection for motorists.  I think Travin is known for his videos explaining the legal aspects of using filming from a registrar in court.  The brochure in the box briefly describes what to do with the video in the event of an accident - from the moment of the incident to parsing the traffic police.  I think the "Mast Hav" for the glove box of any motorist.  For even if you carefully read the ‚Äúbefore‚Äù, it‚Äôs not a fact that in a nervous environment you can at least remember something.  <a href="http://advocam.ru/videoregastrator-solominka.html">Here AdvoCam posted</a> , so to speak, the full version of the recommendations.  Which can take advantage and owners of registrars of other brands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d8e/a77/640/d8ea7764023de32826884bf89998ab50.jpg"><br><br>  From the rest - CD with software, miniUSB cable and compact manual. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f59/c78/092/f59c780921d599cc64dff921205a52d3.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Installation </h4><br>  I can‚Äôt say that the AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red bracket is brand-name, for some time I have seen a similar holder in many registrars of other companies.  In any case, this is the option that I invariably meet in AdvoCam models for at least a year.  Useful feature number one - the power connector is located directly in the holders.  And when connected, it is initially located at the top of the structure, hiding the cable from the eyes and unambiguously motivating for laying under the casing.  This is much better than the side power connector on the case, when it‚Äôs close to the cigarette lighter - and often motorists don‚Äôt hide the wire at all, and throw it directly.  Moreover, thoughts like "then I will do it right," do not even arise.  Plus, if you need to quickly remove the recorder from the mount and shoot a particularly interesting event outside the car, you do not need to disconnect the wire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/603/572/d2e/603572d2eee59a88996a13f0ca8d0313.jpg"><br>  Useful property number two is a hinged holder.  The recorder can be rotated as you like, the time spent on it is minimal.  The leg between the hinge and the device case is microscopic, therefore, the holder practically does not increase the overall dimensions of the ‚Äúobservational structure‚Äù.  Perhaps I would not have refused an additional bolt to adjust the rigidity of the course of the hinge.  This would eliminate the possibility that the hinge will become loose in the future.  Although I am familiar with drivers who use this bracket for about a year and do not observe any special traces of the "hesitations". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/00f/8f7/e68/00f8f7e68db46ce66ac438c0bcd1240b.jpg"><br><br>  I am not a fan of completely hidden installation of recorders, but if desired, the AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red can almost be ‚Äúscreened‚Äù by the rear-view mirror.  Yes, there is a large 2.7-inch screen.  But the height is only 48 mm - other models without a screen at all, and even larger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/91d/466/808/91d4668083ec63d9a94b07516191cd92.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Housing, management </h4><br>  Registrars do not refer to devices that must have a memorable appearance.  So extremely rarely we are pleased with something like interesting elements of the case or even more colors.  AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red is notable for one detail - a bright red insert on the front side.  There is also a model AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Blue with a completely identical body, but a blue stripe.  I do not think that the point of the registrar installation is that motorists or traffic police officers do not know about the shooting being conducted.  And so - an additional reason to notice the registrar and, in any case, change the belligerent attitude to constructive communication. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d9/be7/93e/7d9be793e882589c7646ac963606c9a7.jpg"><br><br>  The body is made of plastic, resembling softtach.  There was no particular tendency to accumulate traces of operation, although 100% protection against AdvoCam-FD8 prints Profi-GPS Red does not guarantee.  A glossy insert is better not to touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a23/078/4ab/a230784aba6215510329a97ce5111b57.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the lens, on the front side is IR illumination and speaker slots. <br><br>  The connectors are familiar - AV-out, miniUSB and miniHDMI.  If desired, it is possible to connect the recorder to the computer via miniUSB, and supply power from the cigarette lighter - you never know what will happen to the bracket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/28e/3b4/590/28e3b45906ca045ec39e583cda875e3a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d2/2af/355/1d22af35531f02ebf28d75b3b6c4bdfe.jpg"><br><br>  Push-button controls are built on six buttons.  For some reason, AdvoCam highlights ‚ÄúOne touch technology‚Äù - managing one-touch main functions: protecting the file from being overwritten, muting / turning on sound recording, turning on the backlight, etc.  In fact, all this is practically no different from the set of buttons and their tasks in other registrars.  Plus, AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red has the same claim as for the ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù - there are no visual picrograms that would characterize the performance of a particular function.  For some reason, there are pictograms up / down, although it is also intuitively clear which button is responsible for moving in which direction.  You can not say about turning on / off the screen or microphone.  In fairness, the key assignments are remembered for a couple of days, and I didn‚Äôt refer to the instructions later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9b/c09/9c0/e9bc099c03020e9d72c8ade3653d3b0c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/176/7dd/852/1767dd8528a66b183f1cc8e2ff5bb60f.jpg"><br><br>  I'll take the advantages to the fact that there is no solo photo mode, a separate button allows you to take a quick photo at any time.  Accordingly, it is not necessary to once again press the "M" key, making your way to the list of settings.  By the way, the buttons have a clear move, nothing dangles or rattles.  And in general, the assembly of the body is good, there are no cracks or backlashes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7b/124/9e3/b7b1249e34691c429fcf4e9c5c4e00fb.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Inside </h4><br>  Out of curiosity I looked inside the case.  In principle, nothing special, you can do without comments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a82/609/31b/a8260931bd9906e4863fc35abaf9e1b0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90a/221/865/90a221865902a53d3f7f4e207ad71077.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9a/717/3e1/d9a7173e1537e341ebf854ca8f4fbf27.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c27/971/3c5/c279713c5e200a0af83fbc0df6da60e9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/385/38d/e41/38538de41be2e42721f8248acf059e5d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/530/7f6/362/5307f6362670f4cc5683b1d88fdebfde.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/669/8f4/623/6698f46236b93ff49d1255eb6d7f8557.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e4/fc2/1e4/4e4fc21e48a6115d585c8397db48d2ac.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6c/e22/4d5/b6ce224d5cfcf52cc8cf31192d10793e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Settings, in work </h4><br>  It's hard for me to judge how much AdvoCam and other brands depend on some ‚Äústock‚Äù firmware in terms of the possibility of making changes.  In the sense that in some models of the brand I have seen the separation of settings into several tabs (video / "the rest"), but specifically in AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red there is a solid list.  All basic options such as changing the resolution, setting the license plate, controlling the WDR, backlight, etc.  in stock.  What is missing is a couple of points for video, such as exposure, white balance.  Although I suspect that 99.9% of drivers would not touch them even if they are available. <br><br>  Now I‚Äôll talk about LDWS.  This system monitors the vehicle's stay in the current lane and gives a loud beep when shifted to the lane to the right or left.  According to the system, there can be a trip to the side of the road or to the ‚Äúoncoming lane‚Äù - with attendant sad consequences.  It is clear that the LDWS - the prerogative of travelers and truckers.  Therefore, if you are going to buy AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red, think carefully about whether all the features of the model will be useful to you.  It may be more reasonable to make a choice in favor of the same AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Blue.  If you definitely want Super Full HD - then AdvoCam-FD7 Profi-GPS. <br><br>  LDWS should be treated with the understanding that the system is far from perfect.  This is not a claim to AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red, but LDWS features even in the recorder for $ 300, even as an option in the car for $ 50,000. Most of all, the system loves excellent markup and sunny (or at least - clear) days.  If the conditions are met, there will be almost no false positives, and warnings will be solely in the case.  Cloudy weather has set in, twilight is approaching, half-erased markings are in front of you - LDWS will begin to "act up".  This statement, again, was confirmed in AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red to the same extent as in other recorders I tested with LDWS.  I note that (in my experience) brands always honestly warn customers about the vagaries of the system.  Considering that in Russia, the intercity roads are not always distinguished by high-quality coverage, first of all, I would advise AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red to those who like traveling in Western Europe. <br><br>  We turn to the second important feature - the warning of speed cameras.  The principle of operation is extremely simple - there is a built-in base of cameras, the GPS recorder determines our location and searches for the nearest ‚ÄúPOI‚Äù.  It is clear that warnings are received only about stationary complexes, including the Strelka ST, which is particularly popular in Russia (and elusive for some radar detectors).  In my opinion, warnings about cameras are needed only for inattentive drivers, and not wanting to avoid the punishment of conscious racers.  And even if you follow the speed, the warning of the recorder increases the vigilance.  In the end, Strelka not only monitors speed, but also rebuilds ‚Äúin the wrong lane‚Äù severely punishes.  One of my acquaintances so for the month scored in the same place fines for 17,000 rubles (~ $ 485) - here you have the consequences of saving on gadgets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/753/2ba/d66/7532bad66992db24a81110c8b25ed21c.jpg"><br><br>  Regarding the completeness of the AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red base, there is still room for improvement.  I compared with the bases of the cameras in the navigator "Progorod", the registrar recognized about 70%.  Given that the list is updated almost every month - a good result.  In theory, before the end of the summer AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red will get a comprehensive list of cameras.  The database is stored in the speedcam.txt file in the root directory of the memory card.  Accordingly, the most ‚Äúflushed‚Äù drivers do not need to wait for any updates - you can import data from third-party projects with daily updates. <br><br>  I can not say that I am glad to expand the functionality of the GPS receiver, as I still consider the possibility of using it exclusively for recording a moving track as an extremely dubious ‚Äúbun.‚Äù  Finally a few words about the accelerometer - the sensor worked as it should, I set the sensitivity level to ‚Äú3‚Äù out of seven possible (more - higher sensitivity). <br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br>  Shooting is conducted in the resolution of 2304 x 1296, 1920 x 1080 or 1280 x 720 pixels.  Everywhere - with a frequency of 30 fps.  In addition, there is a TimeLapse mode with a reduced frequency of 1 fps and the ability to fit on a 64 GB card for up to two weeks of continuous shooting.  A motion sensor is attached to the standard recording - ‚Äúparking mode‚Äù, in which shooting starts automatically when movement appears in the frame.  As practice shows, a useful option, even if you go a couple of minutes to shop at the store. <br><br>  Components, in terms of current flagships, in a good sense, "pop".  A glass lens with five lenses, a decent 3 megapixel Aptina matrix (1/3 ") and an Ambarella A7 processor that doesn‚Äôt need any special presentation. From all it turns out that AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red is not afraid of shooting in low light conditions or in bad weather - which is a priority for Russia and the surrounding countries. In general, in order not to spread for a long time, I will immediately give examples of day and night shooting. Under the video - links to the original files. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/LTCfnpcwdng%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjcNIH1lxnE5Gi-ySR7MmE3tqGjcw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://www.4sync.com/video/LWbhd1Xz/02211417_0014.html">Original file</a> <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/B3aapiIMTfE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500008,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhUm1x_zZjxOrrVSFAs5GCWzUjbAg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a href="http://www.4sync.com/video/tIT0qpn9/02212108_0042.html">Original file</a> <br><br>  Frankly, no matter how much I looked at shooting new-fashioned Super Full HD recorders with the Ambarella A7, I did not notice any tangible and fundamental difference in the quality of the recording between them.  Yes, at the maximum the camera produces even 2304 x 1296 pixels, without a hint of interpolation.  But to say that it really does increase clarity by a factor of one and a half (including the distance of readability of state numbers) ‚Äîno, I won't say that.  Again, I am somewhat confused by the incomprehensible effect, ahem, ‚Äúlint‚Äù - there is a feeling that, regardless of the conditions, a certain ‚Äúnoise‚Äù works.  However, in general, the picture does not lag behind the top Full HD recorders with a price of up to 10,000 rubles.  I will say even more - AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red removes no worse than some models for 12,000 rubles. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  If you need ‚Äúfull stuffing‚Äù, then AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red will be a good choice.  Here and Super Full HD, and (original, but still) radar detector, and the system LDWS.  There are other advantages such as mounting, a complete memory card, etc., but they can be found in more affordable models of the brand.  As I said, the issue price is 7,090 rubles (~ $ 202), for the version without GPS and accelerometer - for 6,290 rubles (~ 179).  In my opinion - the ‚Äúgolden mean‚Äù, since there are much more expensive models on the market with a similar set of functions, which are not particularly superior to AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS Red.  On the other hand, recently AdvoCam released the budget AdvoCam-FD Black-GPS for 4,590 rubles with a very decent quality of shooting.  If you start from it, the surcharge of two and a half thousand rubles for LDWS and Strelka does not look excessive.  The disadvantages I would take two points - the difficulty of setting up the LDWS without instructions, as well as the need to get used to a not very simple control - to remember the key assignments for the day is very difficult. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/224329/">https://habr.com/ru/post/224329/</a></p>
