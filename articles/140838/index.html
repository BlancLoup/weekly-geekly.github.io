  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The most important toolkit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have long wanted to write on this topic, but creating a topic, hung up for two minutes, trying to figure out where to stuff it (in which topic).  As a result, stuffed into programming, but the topic is relevant in general for the whole habr as a whole.  It's about the eyes. <br><br>  Also, before starting, I would like to say a few words for those who will scream / think that the post has been paid.  I just share my experience with users, describe what I tried and what helped me / not really.  I would also like this post to collect information about who and how solves this problem, because the topic becomes somehow relevant for everyone in due time. <br><br>  Let's get started <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And today we will talk about the most important tool - the eyes.  To me, as a programmer, the question of keeping the view in a normal state is more relevant than ever.  In many literature, you can find recommendations to spend for the monitor no more than 4 or 6 hours.  But let's admit, we spend on the monitor for orders of magnitude more time, because this is our bread.  So the way obviously disappears, no matter how cool.

      But what we can really do is get enough sleep.  Healthy sleep is the main guarantee of good vision.  I noticed that at times when the number of hours for sleep is reduced to 5 hours, over three days, the eyes begin to gradually accumulate fatigue and acquire a firm pink shade :).  Getting enough sleep, even on weekends, is one of the rules to think about when it comes to vision. <br><br>  But, actually, not for the sake of common words this post was started.  I would like to talk about drug / folk eye treatments.  I also want to note here that all of the below is: <br>  a) my personal IMHO, based on the experience of using <br>  b) in no case is not an indication of the action and can not replace the trip to the doctor.  The author is not responsible for self-treatment and its outcome. <br><br><h5>  1. Black tea </h5><br>  The old folk method, which was used by our ancestors.  Brewed tea, the stronger the better.  Tea should be allowed to cool, then soak a cotton swab there and wipe your eyes.  Despite the simplicity, the method is effective in those moments when there are pronounced sharp symptoms, such as redness and burning.  In any case, after using it, it is best to crawl away from the company on this day. <br><br><h5>  Vitamins: Blueberry Forte </h5><br>  What I periodically drink through courses.  I don‚Äôt know if this is a placebo or there is a real sense, but in difficult situations when the load on the eyes jumps up - one of the ways to help the eyes.  You should not expect the effect immediately - in spite of a pill, you will not see the yaki falcon.  It is rather an aid to the eyes, although in the comments I can be corrected. <br><br><h5>  Vizin </h5><br>  A very powerful remedy that removes redness and other symptoms within 15 minutes.  To him should be treated with great caution.  Before use, or better beforehand (hello to those who print the instructions in the 3rd font), read the instructions ATTENTIVELY, and especially the rules of administration and side effects.  I used it only a couple of times when I forgot and started to smoke in the workplace (smoke naturally ate my eyes), but the effect was always what was called on the face.  It is difficult to say something concrete, because on the one hand it helps quickly, on the other - you understand that this is not a tool for everyday use. <br><br><h5>  Finally </h5><br>  I propose that the Hubs community complement this post with examples of what they used.  Also to everyone who decides to post curse / zaminusovat and so on.  I do this because practically everyone will face this problem, and what is most offensive is that in this situation you can‚Äôt sit at the computer anymore and don‚Äôt read the forums regarding that.  what exactly should yuzat.  So you need to know the enemy in person. <br><br>  Of course, the most correct thing in this situation is to consult a doctor.  But, given the specifics of sitting at the computer, it is sometimes problematic.  If there is an opportunity to go to the doctor and consult with him, and the only reason why you do not do this is laziness - I urge you to overcome it all the same :) <br><br>  And the last.  I ask you very much - if the doctor prescribed the medicine, and not just freely bought in a pharmacy - please indicate this.  Remember that your advice can take advantage of spitting on the warning at the beginning of the article.  And it is better to once again clearly indicate that the reason for the use was a visit to a doctor who considered all the symptoms, incl.  not relevant to the eyes, and wrote out the most appropriate. <br><br>  Have a nice day everyone <br><br>  I put in the post tips that somehow came from users of Habr.  In contrast to the post, the advice is not aimed at eliminating the consequences, but at actions to prevent the occurrence of such situations.  So: <br><br>  <b>UPD1:</b> from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/vitazheltyakov/" class="user_link">VitaZheltyakov</a> <br>  - Very large monitor.  Although many of them are "afraid", but the perception of information from a large area dramatically reduces the load from the eyes. <br>  - Two color themes.  One for a day job - a dark text on a white background;  and night work is the opposite. <br>  - Carnitine-L.  In tablets, the drug is called ‚Äúcarniton.‚Äù  Although it does not directly affect the eyes, carnitine increases recovery functions, i.e.  relieves fatigue - you can plow for 14 hours a day.  The remedy is very good, ‚Äúnatural‚Äù, even athletes take it. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/7313/" class="user_link">7313</a> <br>  but it‚Äôs not easy to bring yourself to Vizin :) The main thing is to follow a simple rule - the eyes are supposed to be in constant motion.  Those.  you need to blink more often, periodically shift your head left-right, do not forget to look at the wall behind the monitor, suddenly and sharply look as much as possible left-right-up without turning your head and at least 10 seconds into the distance pensively and defocusedly.  At the same time, one should not underestimate the interrelation of all processes in the body, and especially the static positions of the head and neck, which are traditional for computer scientists and deadly for the spine and blood circulation.  They, if not strange, also need movement.  Periodically look at the ceiling, look over your shoulder, recline on the chair back and forth with an emphasis on the table with your stomach, find an emphasis for your knees under the table and periodically rest on it with all your weight and two legs and one by one. <br>  PS And stop cursing the children for balancing on the two legs of the chair and constant squirming - their body knows what it is doing and trying to protect the spine from a young age :) <br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/7313/" class="user_link">7313</a> <br>  And once such a binge went, there are a few very important things.  The change in activity already mentioned ‚Äî even if one cannot go to the gyms, then everyone can afford to walk for 30-40 minutes on foot.  And it doesn‚Äôt hurt to do it with a different pace - from the main (mostly) to the fastest (several times 100 steps).  Well, I understand that it is necessary to charge several times a day, getting up and walking, waving your arms and ideally bending and squatting - so that by the age of 40 not to earn oneself less dangerous, but more unpleasant hemorrhoids. <br>  In this case, do not forget about the general culture of the workplace.  Here, too, the tips are simple, but not obvious to everyone.  Avoid narrow computer desks.  Pullouts and comic pads under his arm from somewhere under the table were invented by designers who didn‚Äôt think at all about the consequences of their delights for joints.  Remember more often what first-graders taught in Soviet schools - the table should be spacious at the correct height, and the elbows should not just lie on the table, but should be able to be supported with a periodic transfer of body weight to them.  This significantly relieves the shoulder girdle and ultimately slows down the inevitable age-related changes in the spine.  The mouse's grip should be stable with a minimum bend of the carpal joint, and the hand should not hang in the air, but lie flat on the table.  Moreover, it is desirable for blood circulation that this part of the table is not completely rigid - it would be good to put some thick fabric or a bubble-wrap plastic bag under your arm.  Exactly the same applies to the keyboard, but when you click the keys, it is much more difficult to keep the wrist joints in a not too bent state.  Here either ergonomically keyboard or ‚ÄúIndian grip‚Äù will help when the keyboard is at a 45% angle on the table, the right hand types from the space side, and the left hand from the Tab and Caps Lock side.  The center of the monitor should be at the bridge of the nose and so that you can look at the monitor without turning your head.  At the same time in the field of view should not be bright objects (lamps, windows on the sunny side, etc.).  Especially deadly for the eyes of fluorescent lamps.  Excessive brightness and contrast of the screen also have a deadly effect - try to set the minimum comfortable values.  Another enemy is black text on a white background.  It is better not to get involved with such a combination and to put the yellowish background color recommended by research # F6F6E.  Well, you can write and list for half an hour, but the most important thing to remember is the main thing - no obstinacy, do not sit for hours, take care of the body, sleep more and eat more correctly :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140838/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140838/</a></p>
