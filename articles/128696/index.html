      So <strong>why is it not as we would like?</strong> <br>  We put forward a few basic hypotheses and carefully consider them.  Once the post on Habr√©, you should start with ... <br><br><h5>  Lack of technical capability (information about such a possibility in the Ministry of Culture) </h5><br>  Of course, we will not assume that it is impossible to create a social network in which there will be a couple of new roles (teacher, tutor, examiner) and the opportunity to take interactive and not very courses.  Rather, it is worth asking whether they know about this possibility in the Ministry of Education? <br><br>  On the one hand, there is a federal program for education and training (... an education development program) for which solid ( <a href="http://old.fcpro.ru/content/view/46/185/">billions of rubles</a> ) money was spent (there are results in a <a href="http://window.edu.ru/">single window</a> , <a href="http://window.edu.ru/window/library%3Fp_rid%3D61921">for example, for 2008 (part two)</a> ), including hundreds of millions for electronic educational resources (ESM / COR, roughly the same thing that needs to be added to the social network so that it becomes educational). <br><br>  On the other hand, there is an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/128267/">electronic textbook</a> in which, apparently, the textbooks will be even without hypertext.  About the other EORs, the more you can not remember. <br><br>  We assume that the hypothesis <em>is wrong</em> .  Although the above-mentioned electronic miracle makes guard. <br><br>  The Ministry of Education is also carefully monitoring compliance with certain standards ... <br><br><h5>  The need to follow SanPiN </h5><br>  In addition to the diverse requirements of <abbr title="Sanitary Rules and Regulations">SanPiN,</abbr> such as the maximum number of people in a class, the presence of a certain area of ‚Äã‚Äãwindows and certain sizes of desks, there are also requirements for the time a student can spend on a computer. <br><br>  That is, even in a class in computer science, no matter how much the applied topic is led by the teacher, the whole lesson cannot be taken behind the machines.  The norms change from class to class (if memory serves me, then it is 15 minutes in grades 1-4, 30 minutes from 9 to 11; somewhere between 4 and 9 classes there is a smooth transition in two stages), but this does not change the essence - you can not learn only for computers.  And if we consider the OSS as a way to develop education, then we are obliged to take into account the norms adopted in this education. <br><br>  Whatever one may say, it turns out that a significant (and in the junior and middle grades are definitely large) students should receive a part of the material without the help of a computer (projectors and interactive boards to which the teacher is attached do not count).  Mark the hypothesis as <em>true</em> . <br><br>  Here it is necessary to pay attention to a substantial number of existing distance learning systems that have an impressive number of users (especially in the west).  But if you look closely, it turns out that the majority of users of these systems are engaged in obtaining HE or are engaged in retraining, advanced training, etc.  Perhaps the case is still in ... <br><br><h5>  Motivation.  Attention. </h5><br>  What does a <strong>good</strong> teacher's lesson look like?  For simplicity, consider the lesson without a controlling part and without work for a computer.  Do not forget that teachers are not only informatics, but they are also part of the educational system (and, accordingly, candidates for participation in the OSS). <br><br>  And so, what does a good teacher do when he needs to give out anything but outstanding material?  He builds a lesson using various techniques.  His lesson is dynamic, communicating with everyone he communicates with everyone.  Every few minutes (the interval depends on age characteristics) the type of activity (and information perception channel) of pupils changes: they just listened to an interesting story about ... the past, and now they are trying to imagine themselves as historical figures and draw a dotted line on the map, and in a couple of minutes they solve the problem question, which is the key to the next milestone of the past ... And all the didactic materials (textbooks, maps, photos, presentations, sound recordings, video materials, EORs ...) here serve one purpose, and this goal  or to teach.  Or even like this: <strong>teach</strong> .  And while he teaches - students want to know what will happen in a minute.  They are attentive, focused on the material ... after how many years can they themselves maintain such motivation and concentration on what they need, and not on what they want? <br><br>  It is possible to list further a long time later that every lesson is a good teacher, this is not about that.  The point is that <em>little of</em> what a good teacher uses in his lessons can be translated into an application for the social network.  And no video recordings, programs, no consideration of the psychophysical features of perception of information can replace a <strong>good</strong> teacher.  Mark the hypothesis <em>true</em> . <br><br>  In our country, there are many places where distance learning is introduced.  Basically this is of course VO and what comes after it.  Also, universities are happy to organize a variety of quizzes, teaching competitions for schoolchildren ... and only.  In any case, both in school and in universities, teachers are still largely responsible for motivation.  And the statements ‚Äúyes I am ...‚Äù, ‚Äúyes we are ...‚Äù more often come from those who actually can take care of themselves.  From those who know what he wants (or should) learn.  And these people, as a rule, have finished their tower for a long time.  Their experience cannot be shifted to the entire education system. <br><br>  What is often forgotten is that the school is engaged not only in teaching ... <br><br><h5>  Upbringing </h5><br>  When parents send their children to school, they have the right to expect that their children will learn to communicate with other children, will know what the internal organs of alcoholics and drug addicts look like, will not ask questions about where children come from, will know about methods of contraception and why they are forbidden to walk until one o'clock ... In the same way, teachers in schools educate the best human qualities, advise circles and various supplementary education institutions that will help find their place in this world, discover talents in themselves;  impart patriotism and affection for cleanliness, tidiness. <br><br>  Of course, the student is more receptive to authoritative individuals.  If the teacher is not with him every day, from minute to minute, by proving his rightness by his existence, to form his authority, then the upbringing is unlikely to be successful. <br><br>  Try to explain (not so that they would remember, but so that they would understand) to an unfamiliar group of 12 flight children what the Great Patriotic War was (and this is one of the easiest ways of education), and what their ancestors did for them.  Try it.  But chur - by mail (well, or through a social network).  And so, that after that they would not suffer from neurosis. <br><br>  In general, we add a hypothesis to the approved piggy bank. <br><br><h5>  Results </h5><br>  Modern teaching methods are not built from scratch, and there is enough sense in using them.  Of course, the educational system is very inert, but this does not mean that it is worth demolishing everything and building a new one.  Pedagogy is developing, and information and communication technologies gave a huge impetus to the development.  Give time, and changes in pedagogy will firmly come to life ... perhaps not ours, and not our children.  But grandchildren and great-grandchildren for sure. <br><br><h5>  Little dream </h5><br>  Personally, I would very much like to see a <em>normal</em> information system, a portal, on the basis of which any school could make its website (with timetables, grades, news, photo and video galleries, a forum, means of providing distance learning ...) and so that there would be no need to know any IT wisdom.  And it could be called an educational social network. <br><br>  PS <br>  Please do not write about the fact that somewhere there are teachers who would be better to replace with a gigabyte of EORs and a social network for students. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128696/</a></p>
