  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Manga "Entertaining statistics", "The Mystery of Disasters" and other similar books</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We are talking about unusual textbooks that stand in the middle between high school textbooks and purely popular science brochures.  Nevertheless, there is a clear dividing line between scientific schools and such textbooks - the latter are aimed specifically at learning, entertainment chips are just a form of presenting serious material.  The general for all such books, as it seems to me - the presentation of the material in the form of a comic book and / or in the form of a dialogue of two or more people.  Usually two interlocutors - a student and a teacher, one constantly asks questions, often stupid or funny, the second tries to explain in a playful way. <br><br>  In the post a lot of screenshots of several books.  One of them, which I completely recast about the catastrophes and posted pdf.  I ask to consider, under habrakat not one megabyte of pictures, the text is much less.  I apologize in advance for the quality of some shots - the night reshoot did not help.  Perhaps there are more pictures than necessary, but I tried to show the basic principles - the graphic, game way of presenting the material, the plot and the dialogues. <br><br>  I did something like a retrospective: the first book is a fresh Japanese comic-manga about the mathematics of the 2010 edition, then a book from the 80s about mathematics, the theory of catasrophs.  The latter is a beginner‚Äôs radio electronics tutorial, familiar to several generations of readers around the world since the 1930s.

The author has quite an adult textbook on this topic, a comic appeared for a popular introduction to a <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584">complex area of ‚Äã‚Äãmathematics</a> .  According to the definition of the mathematician V. Arnold: <blockquote>  ‚ÄúDisasters are called catastrophes, resulting in a sudden response of the system to a smooth change in external conditions.  Sources of the theory of catastrophes are the theory of singularities of smooth maps and;  theory of bifurcations of dynamical systems. </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/66f/4af/9ea/66f4af9eaa66df82d7268c3d0991cda6.jpg"><br><br>  The characters of Stuart Rosa, Gaston and the little animal clips travel between times and clarify for themselves the topic of convolutions, bifurcations.

In 1925, the family of the famous Odessa pianist Davyd Iceberg went to France for treatment or, there, on a tour and did not return.  His son Eugene Iceberg publishes in the 30s.  in Paris, a textbook of radio electronics in the form of a conversation between two friends - the wise by experience Lyuboznaykin and the weak, frivolous beginner Neznaikin.  As a result, at the end of their conversations, Neznaikin himself assembles his receiver.  And not only is he alone - according to reviews, in the late 60s and later, many people studied and collected their devices using this book.  Although the book is formally not a comic book, but it is close to it - the text accompanies a large number of pictures in the margins, then there are drawings and radio circuits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed0/137/5da/ed01375dacfbe2364ad07a433a0254a2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/488/e66/dbc/488e66dbcdd6e343cb876fcb08d89e25.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b8/cc2/f28/2b8cc2f289ef3b662083af39f4a3996c.png"><br><br>  Such books began in the early 30s, withstood many reprints after the war, were published en masse in many languages.  These are not comics, but very similar to them.  Books are built as a dialogue of Neznaikin and Lyuboznaykin with drawings on the margins.  With the development of radio engineering, Iceberg had to correct their conversations.  In the editorial board of the Soviet editions of all his books, the first in the list can be seen academician Axel Berg.  The history of these books is a story of tremendous success. <br><br>  After the lamps went transistors - is there a publication of ‚Äú <a href="http://electrik.info/ebooks/170-radio-yeto-ochen-prosto-e-ajsberg.html">Radio?</a>  <a href="http://electrik.info/ebooks/170-radio-yeto-ochen-prosto-e-ajsberg.html">- It's very easy!</a>  ‚ÄúWhere transistors are introduced - after a lengthy piece of information about electrons, pnn junctions, etc. <br>  Separately, there is a book dedicated only to transistors <a href="http://www.alnam.ru/book_trn.php">Transistor?</a>  <a href="http://www.alnam.ru/book_trn.php">- It's very easy!</a>  (the link is scanned by page).  In the 70s appeared in different variations ‚Äú <a href="http://padabum.com/d.php%3Fid%3D25189">Television - it is very simple!</a>  ‚ÄúAnd the team‚Äú <a href="http://www.radiolibrary.ru/library/mrb/mrb-0884.html">Radio and TV?</a>  <a href="http://www.radiolibrary.ru/library/mrb/mrb-0884.html">- It's very easy!</a>  ‚ÄúA friend of mine told me that he had been studying a book on television at school and, in the end, had collected his TV.  Surely he was helped, besides, a separate kinescope and a bunch of specific details could then be obtained only by disassembling the finished telly.  Personally, I had a meeting with Iceberg‚Äôs books at school, but for various reasons the television did not go, but the radio had a chance to solder many small handicrafts. <br><br>  My father used to study these books in his time, and I - in middle classes.  Although now it seems to me that I did not reach much ... I soldered something on transistors, but without a deep understanding.  But on the lamps I did nothing at all - I did not see anywhere in the sale of "pure" triodes.  But soldered according to the scheme of UT adjustable rectifier from 0.7 to 12V and VHF receiver from the designer.  It was an amazing feeling! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/823/03e/3aa/82303e3aad982849ff88e20e4f7681fa.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8e1/df4/6bc/8e1df46bc283701afd5e660b63673d2c.jpg"><br><br>  There have also been the continuation of at least one more author, Jean-Paul Amision <a href="http://www.radiolibrary.ru/library/mrb/mrb-0885.html">Electronics? .. There is nothing easier!</a>  .  It can be seen that the entire outline remains the same, all the heroes also migrated, but the drawings and topics of conversations changed. <br><br></div></div><br><br>  Also in the 90s I met several translated American comics about the economy.  General topics were explained - goods, money supply, inflation, laws of supply and demand, etc.  A little to the side - I saw gaming books on chess and the game of go. <br><br>  I tried to search the web for something similar, but I saw only 2-3 books that were really similar in meaning.  The rest is just about scientific jokes.  Have you seen anything like this?
