  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How was the JPoint 2015: a full house and interesting details</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The <b>JPoint</b> Java conference gathered a record number of viewers in Moscow: over 1,000 people.  Reports were presented simultaneously in four halls of the ‚ÄúRadisson Slavyanskaya‚Äù (this is not counting the ‚Äúexpert zones‚Äù in the hall), and all of them turned out to be filled.  This is despite the fact that we are talking about a hardcore technical event: a random person, not connected with Java, had nothing to do here.  What exactly gathered so many viewers? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ca/658/e17/8ca658e177974c7c83588ec03d80c752.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  During the opening of the conference, the attendees actively applauded Andrei Cheptsov, IntelliJ IDEA‚Äôs product manager‚Äôs representative, when they came on stage, and this immediately set the tone for the whole event: professional developers gathered in the hall, so the company that works for them that the average user had never heard of , here was a star status.

      However, if the reports were focused strictly on the developers, then with the keynote performance preceding them, everything was different.  Traditionally, keynote does not climb into the wilds of materiel, but represents a more accessible and emotional performance.  And they decided to use this for a bold experiment, instead of calling a technical speaker, calling <b>Dmitry Galkin</b> , a Ph.D. from Tomsk, a specialist in contemporary art.  He did not speak specifically about Java, but that art today is much more closely connected with the development of technology than is commonly believed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/035/9f5/1e1/0359f51e167e4cb8bb192dce4b522cc7.jpg"><br><br>  The theme of contemporary art almost always collects polar reviews, from ‚Äúvery original and interesting‚Äù to ‚Äúwhat nonsense people suffer, and the plants stand.‚Äù  And here it happened the same way: while some listened with interest about controversial and defiant installations and performances, others asked the beaten question ‚Äúwhat the speaker was smoking‚Äù (according to Galkin himself, nothing, he is interested). <br><br>  But, no matter how you feel about the presented, it at least cheered up the hall in front of the main part - technical reports.  Immediately after Galkin, <b>Nikita Salnikov-Tarnovsky (Plumbr)</b> took the scene of the main hall and talked about combating memory leaks - this is not about performances. <br><br>  The second hall at that time was occupied by <b>Anton Keks (Codeborne)</b> , and it was curious to observe the contrast with his own report at the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/255725/">recently held</a> St. Petersburg conference <b>Mobius</b> .  There, he talked about the features of Chromecast in a small hall, and the atmosphere was intimate, but here everything felt as if a rock band conquered the stadium: a lot of people gathered, they were completely absorbed in what was happening, and after the performance they crowded around and arranged such an encore. that the next speakers had to practically banish Anton from the scene.  Keks himself, tall and long-haired, looked in the role of a "rock star" as impossible as he could: he already plays the guitar in his free time and rides a motorcycle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff2/ec3/bd5/ff2ec3bd50f8482dbdfe865e8656a1ac.jpg"><br><br>  What exactly did he get so much attention from?  <a href="http://angryziber.github.io/slides/ibank.html">It</a> may be better to base the architecture of the Internet bank not on Enterprise solutions.  This may seem counterintuitive (Enterprise is associated with reliability, and this is a key concept for a bank) - but Anton very confidently explained on the basis of his experience why the cumbersome and sluggishness of enterprise solutions turns out to be a big drawback, what exactly can be used instead of such solutions and how just do it. <br><br>  And they drove Cupcake from the scene by <b>Baruh Sadogursky</b> and <b>Yevgeny Borisov</b> , who went there to report on Spring.  They became real JPoint Stakhanovists: together they also spoke in another hall with the report ‚ÄúEpic Groovy Puzzlers - Revenge of Brackets‚Äù, and Sadogursky later single-handedly talked about multi-threaded HTTP applications, and also took part in the round table ‚ÄúJava Developer Tools‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/780/d19/e36/780d19e369a6419298928c5d36e29afd.jpg"><br><br>  Meanwhile, while on the main stage, the star of the Russian Java-world, <b>Aleksey Shipilev,</b> talked about java.lang.String, in the fourth hall, two other Oracle representatives - Alexander Belokrylov and Alexander Mironenko - raised an interesting topic: using Java in areas like ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù, where devices have very limited computing power.  The title of the <a href="http://javapoint.ru/presentations/JPoint2015_Belokrylov_Mironenko.pdf">report itself</a> - ‚ÄúTo an Enterprise with 256 KB of RAM‚Äù - made us nostalgically remember the phrase ‚Äú640 kilobytes of memory is enough for everyone‚Äù and think about how technologies are cyclically developing, returning to the old numbers at a new level. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f6/5c6/70f/5f65c670fe144d54a6dbae378f8df5d3.jpg"><br><br>  After that, <b>Aleksey Ragozin</b> from <b>Deutsche Bank</b> spoke in the main hall - and here was the hardcore character of the conference.  When the speaker is not a purely IT company, it can be assumed that it is not entirely about technology.  But it was all about the case: his <a href="http://javapoint.ru/presentations/JPoint2015_Ragozin.pdf">report</a> was devoted to the continuous profiling of Java applications during operation. <br><br>  The lunch break that started further marked the main problem of the conference: when so many people come together, it‚Äôs large and fine, but at the same time it inevitably causes some organizational difficulties.  In this case, they were expressed in the queue length: to get dinner, many had to stand as it should.  I want to believe that this did not spoil the general feeling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c41/4ca/afe/c414caafef7145e7a261740e1a54ed62.jpg"><br><br>  After lunch, in the main hall, <b>Andrei Pangin (Odnoklassniki)</b> <a href="http://javapoint.ru/presentations/JPoint2015_Pangin.pdf">talked</a> about debugging in conditions where standard tools are not enough and you need your own, and <b>Dmitry Chuiko (Oracle)</b> , <a href="http://javapoint.ru/presentations/JPoint2015_Chuyko.pdf">speaking</a> of Completable Future, was surprised at how many people in the hall deal with multithreading .  But the real show began after that with the second release of <b>Alexei Shipilev</b> : he simultaneously said quite serious things and at the same time did not let him get bored.  In his <a href="http://javapoint.ru/presentations/jpoint-April2015-compress-me.pdf">presentation, the</a> wording (‚Äúbloody enterprise‚Äù) and pictures (‚Äúsqueezed links‚Äù were illustrated with a compressed image of Lenin in exile) made the audience happy - but at the same time made it clear what it was about, successfully fulfilling its main task.  ‚ÄúProceed from the fact that most of the time you are wrong,‚Äù said Shipilev, and he did not want to object. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e9/53d/125/1e953d1258fb4c4a99512b061c3e8be8.jpg"><br><br>  Finally, already at the end of the curtain, a highload round table was held, and it was remarkable, starting with the list of participants: <b>Oleg Bunin</b> - organizer of HighLoad ++, the main Russian conference in the field of high loads, and <b>‚ÄúClassmates‚Äù</b> , from which <b>Oleg Anastasyev</b> and <b>Andrey Pangin</b> were <b>present</b> - the project in which such loads are known firsthand.  And here, too, despite the hardcore theme, the show turned out.  To begin with, the participants discussed what highload is all about - and if it is usually associated with ‚Äúthe site has many visits,‚Äù then Bunin preferred the definition of ‚Äúhighload about understanding internal processes and optimizing them, if you have a standard CMS, then for any amount Visits this will not be heilodom. "  And then they began to answer questions from the audience - and on the move they took down the case of a particular spectator, concluding that the problems described by him were not caused by high loads, his system itself was unreasonably built, and it should be dealt with. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f2/433/f9b/2f2433f9b2c84ebdaa8ab946c3185b89.jpg"><br><br>  Perhaps, this allowed the conference visitors to finally take a lesson, useful not only in the case of highload and Java, but in general in life: when something does not work as it should, you should not have to blame hastily at all the ‚Äúload‚Äù, but consider whether it is correct was originally built. <br><br>  And the <a href="http://javapoint.ru/">conference</a> itself became a kind of life example of a successful high-load project.  Such a number of viewers, speakers, halls and topics - these are also high loads, simply measured not by the number of requests to the server.  And if a hitch, in addition to the queue for lunch, does not occur, the reports are not canceled and do not stand out strongly from the schedule, and everything goes as planned - it means that the initial approach was correct. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d7/f4c/0bc/2d7f4c0bcc2548f1b17662fcb41bd715.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/257371/">https://habr.com/ru/post/257371/</a></p>
