  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A few theses on e-reading</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last summer, quite unexpectedly, I got the idea to purchase an e-book based on E-Ink.  Fortunately, at that time a good friend was in the states, Amazon and Barnes &amp; Nobles lowered the prices of their offspring, and there was no problem to ask for help.  Everything merged into a fleeting decision to purchase something from the manufacturers mentioned.  Paradoxically, my eyes focused on the Nook, and not on the Kindle.  I had some hostility towards the giant, and the second color display seemed like an interesting solution.  Of course, I will not review the device, because there are already so many of them.  And in my message I will try to reflect all the thoughts and ideas that have been formed during this short period of using the Nook-a and monitoring issues in general.  I tried to break the whole text into separate theses with a few comments. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  E-Ink is only suitable for fiction. </h4><br>  I bought my reading room just for reading artist.  Any attempt to read something professional did not end there.  For many reasons: due to the lack of such literature in the right format, due to the inconvenient navigation of devices based on E-Ink, a small screen.  A lot of things can be included here.  For an artist, there are no problems, just the text is easily formatted and there are no problems with its display. <br><br><h4>  Opinion about reading from a book reader can only be a posteriori. </h4><br>  A person should try to read at least one e-book on a book reader.  Only after that a more or less reasonable attitude towards reading from the device screen can be formed.  This conclusion was not without reason.  Showing and demonstrating the capabilities of Nook-a people far from using any progressive electronic devices and from the words negatively responding to any reading from the screen, I was pleasantly surprised by their positive assessment of use.  First of all, I mean the older, conservative generation.  Well, I did not expect a flattering assessment.  Plus, after about half a year, the nearest circle also wanted similar devices for themselves, and the first purchases have already been made.

    <h4>  Read much more </h4><br>  Quite understandable and obvious phenomenon.  The reader is almost always with you, there are a lot of books - I finished one, I started another, the list of ‚Äúread ahead‚Äù was formed, and so on.  I think everyone can add a lot of points here, I will not spread.  Here, on the way, is an irreplaceable thing, both in a distant and not so much. <br><br><h4>  Paper books will not die </h4><br>  This statement was influenced by the book of the famous Italian scientist Umberto Eco ‚ÄúDo not expect to get rid of books‚Äù, where all issues related to books in general are extremely popular and detailed.  From concept to the history of books.  Indeed, the chances that the greatest product of Gutenberg's generation will disappear is extremely small. <br><br><h4>  The smell of books </h4><br>  Many argue the refusal of the transition to e-books such a feature of the paper book, like smell.  It is quite reasonable, I myself recall this ‚Äúsmell of antiquity‚Äù with pleasure.  As an alternative, jokes and commerce have already come up with a book-smelling <a href="http://smellofbooks.com/">spray</a> .  I immediately recall here the love of car enthusiasts for old cars, the engine of which ‚Äúpleasantly‚Äù grumbles and other features of time.  Lovers have always been, but the average majority buys something newer. <br><br><h4>  Migration of articles from the Internet </h4><br>  Often on the Internet there are big and terribly interesting articles.  Such that they should be postponed for further reading.  Transfer them to the reader easier than ever.  With the help of some translation service web-page, for example, in pdf.  I use joliprint.  There are a lot of similar converters.  This one suits me, removes all unnecessary.  It takes only the content part, but the formatting on the reader is imperfect.  If anyone knows a similar converter to epub, write;) Here is <a href="http://prin.tt/q04uLP">an example of</a> converting the last post from the e-books blog to pdf.  (because of the insertions of the code in the text, the example was not the most successful).  My nook-a is not enough, of course, amazona services with sending books to the post office, I dream ... <br><br><h4>  We read pdf-documents with pictures inside on 6-inch readers E-Ink </h4><br>  I don‚Äôt know how it is with the others, but on my Nook-e, when opening a pdf-nickname assembled from images, no scaling is provided.  The document opens page by page as in pdf, no scrolling.  The result is one page per screen, the text is small, unreadable.  I thought that the scanned books were closed for me, but at one point I accidentally entered the <a href="http://www.willus.com/archive/">K2PDFOPT</a> program, which optimizes similar pdf files for a 6-inch screen.  It turns out quite tolerable.  Is that the conversion is not fast.  Thanks to the author.  Now you need to think about how to organize this with djvu. <br><br><h4>  Copyspace </h4><br>  This issue is being actively discussed at various levels, various open letters are being written to the president, there is a serious struggle for digitizing the libraries without an agreement with the author, and so on.  The eternal theme.  With regards to e-books.  It's no secret that the legal market for selling electronic books in Russia is extremely small.  Especially in comparison with the number of sold devices.  My personal opinion is that it is necessary to support this segment and use legal distribution channels.  So we respect the work of others and will contribute to the formation of the market.  I developed such a scheme for myself: I‚Äôm looking for where I can buy - I don‚Äôt find it - I‚Äôm going to convenient pirate services.  Yes, yes, it is not for nothing that he wrote comfortably.  Many commercial service developers have a lot to learn from free projects.  And the content part of them suffers.  My statistics - from ten books is good, if one turns out to be available for sale, and foreigners in general can not be searched.  Maybe the problem will be solved over time, there will be both an assortment and a convenient acquisition channel.  Yes, I'm also against drm in all its manifestations. <br><br>  ps.  I hope, thoughts are not broken and will be partly useful. <br><br>  Update from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/goodsprite/" class="user_link">goodsprite</a> : <br>  I use the service of converting web pages to epub <a href="http://dotepub.com/">dotepub.com</a> / <br>  You can use their extension for <a href="http://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/okpfiebkkmjcnodegbbbiellepfhoglm">chromium</a> : <br>  Or copy the script to the bookmark address: <br>  After conversion, it offers a book for download. <br><br>  I checked on the habre, everything is fine, I also pulled out the content part.  True, the epub program does not embed Cyrillic fonts, of course.  Therefore, on my non-commissioned Nuk there were questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124220/</a></p>
