  <section class="page js-page"><h1>NeoAxis Game Engine 1.0 finally saw the light</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to publish a topic, an overview of the release of the cross-platform game engine NeoAxis, since the authors do not yet have an account on Habr√©.  Further from the first person: <br><br>  For more than six years, we (the <a href="http://www.neoaxis.com/">NeoAxis Group</a> company) have been developing a new 3D game engine, starting as a lonely enthusiast‚Äôs idea but turned into a full-scale project, which is now being worked on by an international team of specialists.  After so many years of hard work, we are pleased to announce that NeoAxis Engine has reached version 1.0! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bfc9535d/263b7c0d/26935f1a/af11bdce.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I am the founder and lead developer of the engine.  Long thought about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwriting an article for the Habr and finally decided.  By the way, the backbone of our team is Russian-speaking and lives in Kazan, Russia. <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/7e04bccd/6783de7f/a3e1df16/03013836.jpg"><br>  The NeoAxis engine is positioned as a general purpose engine, which is designed to create games, simulations, visualizations and various 3D systems.  At the moment, several projects have already been released on the engine, some of which are available on Steam, the Mac App Store and other platforms. <br><br>  The main goal of the development of <b>NeoAxis Engine</b> was to create not just a game engine, but an integrated tool with which you can easily create both serious 3D applications and high-quality computer games.  NeoAxis has a huge number of tools to minimize the need to work directly with the code.

      <br>
      The engine is cross-platform.  In addition to <b>Windows</b> support, support for <b>Mac OS X has</b> been added to NeoAxis 1.0.  Also, the engine was adapted to work in Linux via Wine.  Thanks to the well-thought-out architecture, the projects created are transferred to other platforms with minimal effort, eliminating the need to spend a huge amount of time and money on adapting the application to the new platform.  In the future, native support for <b>Linux</b> , <b>iOS</b> and <b>Android</b> will also be added. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/854aaef4/52c7de80/aa986949/ad254dcd.jpg"><br>  Next on the key features of the engine: <br><ul><li>  A unique software environment for creating game logic that comes with the engine.  The system of game objects of the engine is integrated with the Map Editor and the Editor of Game Objects, and also supports high-level synchronization of game objects over the network. </li><li>  NeoAxis has <b>a .NET based API</b> .  Using NeoAxis Engine and .NET technologies, you can develop the logic of your project quickly.  Inside, the engine uses unmanaged <b>C / C ++ language</b> for components such as rendering, physics simulation, and audio playback, which allows for maximum performance. </li><li>  A complete set of editors are required to create your application, including the Map Editor, the Landscape Editor, the Game Object Editor, the GUI Editor, the Effect Editor, the Physical Model Editor, the Material Editor. </li><li>  Support for all major IDEs, including <b>Microsoft Visual Studio</b> , <b>SharpDevelop</b> and <b>MonoDevelop</b> . </li><li>  Modern physics simulation thanks to support from <b>NVIDIA PhysX</b> and <b>ODE</b> .  You can switch the physics engine without recompiling. </li><li>  Ability to create window and non-game applications.  The SDK includes sample applications for <b>WinForms</b> and <b>WPF</b> . </li><li>  The engine's rendering system supports most modern technologies, including 64-bit HDR, Parallel-Split Shadow Maps, realistic water shading, etc.  NeoAxis Engine supports a wide range of video cards, including all modern video cards, integrated video cards and laptop video cards. </li><li>  Released on the base of the game engine is available in online stores such as Steam, Impulse, Mac App Store and GamersGate. </li></ul><br>  The rapid development of applications in NeoAxis Engine is facilitated not only by the availability of a set of editors, but also by the existing documentation, which contains detailed guidance on all aspects of working with the engine.  Documentation is available in both English and Russian. <br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/5f0c6059/cf52c3e7/ddb00dfd/bb1efa23.jpg"><br>  Another useful solution we found was the <b>inclusion of ready-made examples of games in the SDK</b> (including First-person shooter, Third-Person Shooter, Real-time Strategy, Arcade).  Users of the engine use ready-made templates as skeletons of their projects, gradually changing it in accordance with the necessary requirements, instead of writing all the game logic from scratch. <br><br>  A characteristic feature of the NeoAxis Engine is the presence of a sufficiently large and active community that was formed while the engine was still in development.  While the engine was still in development, quite a lot of both game and non-game projects were already developed on it.  Members of the community are also actively developing add-ons that allow to further expand the functionality of the engine (for example, among the latter, an addon that adds support for <b>Kinect</b> ). <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/07d41110/486c24dd/8d365eba/c862cce0.jpg"><br>  From a financial point of view, the NeoAxis engine‚Äôs advantage is a flexible licensing system.  You can start developing your project completely free of charge using a fully functional <b>non</b> - <b>commercial license</b> .  You will need to purchase a commercial license only if your project reaches the stage of commercial implementation.  And the cheapest commercial license costs only $ 95.  The price of licenses varies for companies and for individual developers (in order to encourage the latter).  Moreover, under such licensing conditions, royalties, however, are completely absent. <br><br>  Summing up, we can say that NeoAxis Engine is a unique set of tools with which you can quickly develop high-quality 3D applications. <br><br>  More information here: <a href="http://www.neoaxis.com/">http://www.neoaxis.com</a> . <br><br>  PS: We welcome any comments.  Also, if someone is interested, I will be happy to tell you about the history of the engine.  Pull on a separate article. <br><br>  From myself I want to add that our team has been active users of this engine for 2 years, the impressions are extremely positive. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124007/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124007/</a></p>
