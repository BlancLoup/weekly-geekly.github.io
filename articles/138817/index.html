  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The third study of coverage in the Moscow metro</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After our previous study of the Moscow metro, discussions began about free access to the Internet in the underground.  The question was raised several times, but the officials expressed readiness to implement the project, on the contrary, they said that there was no such technical possibility, they took their words back.  Telecommunications operators also did not stand aside and created various information occasions associated with the Moscow metro.  We will return to the question of free Internet access at the end of this study. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Remembering the promises given by the operators in the comments to our <a href="http://gtoday.ru/reviews/stretches-of-the-moscow-metro">past research</a> and not forgetting complaints about the administration of the metro, which recently acquired <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/tech/news/1509439/dorogoj_metropoliten">specific figures</a> , Dzhitedey decided to check how much the operators have advanced in this direction over the past six months. <br><br>  <b>Reference:</b> <i>Moscow Metro has 12 lines, consisting of 185 stations.</i>  <i>This study also takes into account the line of the Moscow monorail, consisting of 6 stations.</i>  <i>You can study the metro map with the coating applied on it on the interactive map of the map.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  On the summary table below, it is clearly seen that the operators did not sit idly in spite of all the difficulties.

      <b>Beeline</b> actively continued to increase its advantage - it covered another 2G network with at least 8 spans, bringing their total number to 160 (of which 24 were covered with full-fledged 3G), at least 24 stations launched a 3G network, which, together with past achievements, resulted in 185 stations with 2G network, 67 of which have 3G coverage.  However, Beeline is lagging behind in other indicators - there is still no connection at the Mitino, Volokolamskaya, Myakinino stations, not to mention completely new stations where none of the operators, Borisovo, Shipilovskaya, Zyablikovo, are located yet. <br><br><img src="http://gtoday.ru/images/content/x_11deb060.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Megaphone</b> for these six months has increased its advantage at the stations - covered 2G with the connection of 188 metro stations, 184 of them are covered with 3G.  Thus, only three recently commissioned stations on the Lyublinsko-Dmitrovskaya metro line remained uncovered.  The situation has improved slightly in the hauls, now the megaphone has 3G in 20 hauls. <br><br>  <b>The MTS</b> , which had long covered the strategic Ring Metro line and retaining an advantage there, was not as active as the other players, and still lags behind the number of covered stations. <br><br>  Well, finally figure out the strengths of each player will allow the chart. <br><br><img src="http://gtoday.ru/images/content/x_009b295b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It should be noted that during the study (February 11 to February 19, 2012), the technical services of the operators could carry out planned and out-of-plan work, which could have a slight effect on the total figures.  We asked operators to comment on our mapped research. <br><br>  <a href="http://gtoday.ru/reviews/issledovanie_pokritiya_mobilnih_setey_v_metro_msk_feb_2012">Operators comments</a> on the results of the study. <br><br>  <a href="http://gtoday.ru/map/metro/moscow">Interactive map of 2g / 3g covering the big three.</a> <br><br>  <b>WiFi in the subway</b> <br>  It is worth noting that taking into account the peculiarities of the coverage, as well as the wishes of the Moscow mayor‚Äôs office and the efforts of the operators, trains with WiFi will be put into test operation in the near future.  The first part is shown to journalists and residents of the capital today, February 24, 2012, on the Sokolnicheskaya metro line.  The technical feasibility of this project was made possible by continuous coverage of the VimpelCom network (Beeline trademark) at the stations and tunnels.  In the near future, we should expect the same project on the Koltsevaya metro line implemented jointly with MTS. <br><br>  Today we tested WiFi in a test train car.  Were left somewhat disappointed - perhaps the problem is in a large number of journalists and bloggers who were simultaneously trying to try out a novelty.  At the peak, it was possible to reach a speed of 1.6 Mbit on our Android device through the <a href="http://speedtest.net/">SpeedTest</a> service. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138817/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138817/</a></p>
