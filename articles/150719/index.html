  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dell Technology Park at IFA 2012</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  These days, Berlin hosts the IFA (Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin) - one of the largest in the world and simply Europe‚Äôs largest exhibition of home appliances and consumer electronics.  In addition, it is also older than CES, CeBIT, Computex, MWC and other famous exhibitions: the first time the IFA took place already in 1924, and various radio products were shown on it. <br><br>  In the first post of Dell on Habr√©, listing the company's products, they first mentioned servers, storage systems, printing and image processing devices, workstations, and only then came to laptops and personal computers.  Indeed, Dell is a true legend of the North American corporate market - for the time being it was focused on ‚Äúheavy‚Äù technology for business.  However, with the development of the trend, called IT Consumerization, more and more devices for sale in regular stores began to appear in the Dell product line.  That is why the company has been participating in the absolutely ‚Äúconsumer‚Äù exhibition IFA for several years now and showing its new products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/609/a66/987/609a66987343a4a5622f4d7e2c61d516.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      The Dell booth occupies a whole room in the 13th pavilion.  It is relatively small against the background of giant installations of some companies, but compares favorably with them exclusively by computer exposure.  As we said a little earlier, not only consumer electronics, but also household appliances, including hair dryers, irons and refrigerators, are shown at IFA.  Dell doesn‚Äôt have anything like it: although the stand doesn‚Äôt look comfortable in a computer environment, you will not find any electro-coaches on it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c7/fb2/285/9c7fb22854ad39225362caeabe8e9426.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Looking at the Dell booth from above you understand that it was not for nothing that they called the Dell Technology Park.</i> <br><br>  Before you talk about new products, it‚Äôs worthwhile to dwell on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/LjJ-F8SoGQo">video</a> that has become a true Dell exposure center at IFA. <br><br>  For those who are reluctant to watch, briefly retell the content.  A simple American girl, Annie, really wanted to fly, but she didn‚Äôt succeed due to a number of physical limitations common to all people.  But the girl turned out to be extremely advanced and, armed with a laptop, she knew what brand, made a small film where she very convincingly takes off from the ground and flies over surprised classmates.  The story is quite touching and well shot.  So, at the IFA everyone can be in Annie's place and, wearing a flight helmet with glasses, make a virtual flight.  This is done, of course, with the help of chroma key technology (chroma key) and looks no less convincing than in the original video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/69f/1b8/557/69f1b85572ac17106640555f461d7317.jpg"><br>  <i>To see yourself flying in the sky, it is not necessary to be able to handle the video editor.</i>  <i>Moreover, it is not necessary to be a girl :)</i> <br><br>  And now - about the updates.  As we know, very soon, the Windows 8 operating system will appear on all counters in the country. You can have a very different attitude to the Microsoft operating systems (Dell works with all the platforms our customers are interested in), but according to the favorite saying of the manager Elvis Presley, ‚ÄúThe numbers are not lie. "  And since different versions of Windows are installed on most computers in the world, many people will want to try the G8.  And how is the new OS fundamentally different from its predecessor?  That's right, the interface, "sharpened" under the control of the fingers - one or more.  At the same time, when working with old applications, you will inevitably have to use the old interface, where you can not do without a keyboard and touchpad. <br><br>  An interesting device that fully supports both Windows modes is the Dell XPS 12 Duo convertible laptop.  Externally, it differs little from the XPS 13 Ultrabook ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/138760/">they</a> already <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/138760/">wrote</a> about it on Habr√©), except perhaps more compact due to the smaller matrix diagonal (12.5 inches instead of 13.3).  The body of carbon fiber (it is fashionable to call it carbon), around the screen - a massive metal edging.  In this case, it performs not only design and protective functions, but serves as a mount for a rotating module with the matrix itself.  It is enough to turn it 180 degrees - and now we have a real tablet computer in our hands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d4d/b7d/d52/d4db7dd522f928891192167566a0081d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b9a/974/8e5/b9a9748e5b0a1bd9af446e7314d93fd3.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Visitors to the booth can look at the Dell XPS 12 Duo just under the massive glass cube ...</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cd5/20e/8f5/cd520e8f582b4d27e39b19e392afdd5c.jpg"><br><br>  <i>... but for the post on Habr√© we were given to see the specimen alive.</i>  <i>Indeed, a laptop-laptop until you turn the screen.</i>  <i>Unfortunately, the location of the ports on the sides is still a terrible secret, and we were asked to shoot only in profile.</i>  <i>Nothing, catch up on the review!</i> <br><br>  Yes, it will be somewhat more massive than analogs without a physical keyboard, but on the other hand its functionality is unlimited.  The Dell XPS 12 Duo will use third-generation Intel Core processors (Ivy Bridge, right up to the Core i7), 2 or 4 GB of RAM, SSDs of 128 GB, and the capabilities of the integrated Intel HD 4000 video card allow you to play World of Tanks on medium settings.  The screen resolution is 1920x1080 pixels (FullHD), and the matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot some TN, but a good IPS.  Therefore, the clarity of the picture, and color reproduction, and viewing angles are excellent.  The screen, however, is glossy, but the point here is not the persistence of Dell engineers, but the protective glass of the level of Gorilla Glass 2, which the technology does not allow to do matte. <br><br>  Of course, inside there is a fan, but it turns on only in 3D mode, and the rest of the time it behaves impeccably quiet.  The battery life is promised up to 10 hours, but we can check it in practice closer to the end of October.  Then tell about the price, which in the United States is unlikely to exceed $ 999 for the younger model.  Yes, I almost forgot - the keyboard of the Dell XPS 12 Duo with switchable backlight. <br><br>  The second device on Windows 8 also looks quite traditional (not to read as ‚Äúboring‚Äù!) And at first resembles an advanced netbook.  But the first impression is deceptive: the Dell XPS 10 is a lightweight (about 600 grams) and thin (10 mm) tablet, inside which is installed a Qualcomm processor of the S4 family (which one is the Terrible Secret). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f5a/ee8/d58/f5aee8d584f1ddedfe99fe7cbaaecf44.jpg"><br><br>  <i>And again at the Dell XPS 10 booth under a protective dome ...</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d0b/863/61d/d0b86361d785ecc6da9de95bef038059.jpg"><br><br>  <i>... and we live!</i>  <i>Very light machine.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/530/658/41a/53065841aec3260bb5acf295e83ebf4e.jpg"><br><br>  <i>Without a keyboard - the usual thin tablet.</i> <br><br>  Accordingly, the "eight" is installed is not simple, but Windows 8 RT.  The similarity with the older sister is just amazing: until you look into the control panel, you can not tell.  The speed of work is also very high: applications run instantly, switching between them also occurs in a fraction of a second - in general, it was not possible to notice the fundamental differences with the Dell XPS 12 Duo sample, where the Intel Core i7 is installed.  We also could not figure out the type of matrix, although by all indications (rich shades, viewing angles) it is not TN.  Its resolution is 1366x768 pixels, which, considering the 10-inch diagonal, looks like the best option. <br><br>  Of course, there are no fans inside - they are simply not needed.  The promised battery life is 10 hours, and when connected to the keyboard docking station, you can safely add as many more.  Well, what can I say - quite impressive!  Dell XPS 10 will be sold with or without a keyboard, but the first option is preferable - if only because of the presence of an HDMI port, a great touchpad and, not least, a pair of USB connectors.  Maybe for toys it is not critical, but if you plan to sometimes work, do not be greedy.  About the price, unfortunately, while we can not tell, although I really want to.  Please be patient until October.  The price tag should not shock anyone.  If only nice :) <br><br>  Also at the exhibition talked about the monoblock Dell XPS One 27 Touch, but respecting the time of readers, we will not dwell on it in detail.  The fact is that its predecessor XPS One 27 has been successfully sold in Russia for a couple of months and is characterized only by the absence of a touch screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f2/c8d/dff/8f2c8ddffef3d7a31c409e8e4e23eff2.jpg"><br><br>  Everything else, including a magnificent 27-inch matrix with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, you can check in action yourself by visiting the right store selling computers.  When the Dell PC on Windows 8 begins to be sold in Russia, we will try to make material on the practicality and usefulness of touch control in everyday tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/359/872/e7b/359872e7b37aa2acbabc5ed11a7f8418.jpg"><br><br>  <i>This is also a photo from the Dell booth.</i> <br><br>  IFA will continue to work until September 5, inclusive, and if you are now in the vicinity of Berlin, be sure to check out the Dell booth.  In addition to the devices mentioned above, you can try out the entire line of Inspiron and play on top devices of the Alienware family.  We really appreciate your assessment of the capabilities of the demonstrated products and their design.  We also plan to show new items in Russia, which will be reported later. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention.  We are waiting for comments! <br><br>  PS When the post was ready, we accidentally met a man at IFA who used our corporate package as a headdress. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d0/daa/aae/2d0daaaae2141d478cd99d5bbefe4c01.jpg"><br><br>  It's nice that all Dell products are so convenient and functional :) He quickly went off into the distance, but if you suddenly recognize him, write to us.  I would like to give him a nice prize for creativity. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150719/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150719/</a></p>
