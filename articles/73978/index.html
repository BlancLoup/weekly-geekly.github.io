  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A little about gaming startups or the question of Ignostre</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I strongly welcome you! <br>  I wanted to discuss the situation on the ‚Äúmarket‚Äù of gaming portals, and in particular, unknown to me (forgive me if I googled badly) the fate of a once promising project.  So let's get started.  Recently, there has been a boom of startups.  what is remarkable, game resources among this boom were somehow not too strongly noted.  Many, sorry for the simplicity of speech, etc., before they reached the MBT, some of them changed investors and sponsors twenty times a day, although they didn‚Äôt get any better, because  apparently "but" crept up from an unexpected side, i.e.  side of the "brain of the project" (he is, if briefly and succinctly - the head). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ac/3ab/85a/0ac3ab85aec77e07364395834f927a85.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now I see the following situation, not to say that it‚Äôs pleasing: full-fledged social resources (not mowing or stupidly rewriting standard forum engines for the needs of ratings, comments and other pseudo-social bebeberds) are somehow not enough.  Two come to mind.  I consider both of them to be quite good in concepts, medium in implementation and impudent (in a good sense) in the sphere of self-promotion.  Here, for example, Gamer.ru - the idea turned out to be so warmly received by the players (although it copies Western analogues and borrows ideas from some domestic portals), that it‚Äôs as if it were stalled in development.  No, do not think, of course, not themselves, but in the development of their own developments, but the fault of everything, I think, is the tempting abyss called a freebie.  If you speak the Internet language, the "usercontent."  The idea evolved so quickly that the creators took holidays and went to warm places to rest (only literary circulation, I don‚Äôt know anything about income or leisure of these guys), leaving the programmers with a simple task on a sticker, supposedly to finish the jewelry work, to polish dizu and dviglo.  But there you need to work a little more with a file and a plane, and not under dviglo and design, but on mechanics and balance ... <br>  There is another representative, Kanobu, who, on the contrary, constantly tries to change something, and he tries so hard and selflessly, which sometimes makes it worse than Gamer.ru.  With good content and attention to users (the same cannos), the usability of the interface is absolutely zero, and after all, accessibility and obviousness, with extensive functionality, is one of the key rules of the project built on Web 2.0 concepts (see Habrahabr). <br>  I don‚Äôt even want to say much about talking about the attempts of classic resources to enter a new age.  AG 2.0, which no longer resembles a gray coffin, but a gray coffin with a bunch of buttons, switches and toggle switches.  NEW gambling, which made from a simple website pretentious, but confusing and impoverished information, etc. <br><br>  And on this background, it appeared, unexpectedly as a crisis and sharply as na ... wasps, Igranostra.  Moreover, by the time of the statements about the project, it was clearly stated that the development had already been carried out for some time, therefore, a year and a half had already passed, now we‚Äôll go a little bit to the third, and the project is all worth it.  Why do those who have experience in a number of successful 2.0 resources suddenly wrap up their work and watch how newcomers take it away, gaining valuable experience along the way ... And in general, what is happening with the resource now?  Does it just stand on a paid hosting or is it still striving somewhere? </div>
