Now we have decided to turn to the experience of our foreign colleagues in order to understand the situations in which they used a qualitative methodology and what the results were. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/924/e6b/1c8/924e6b1c8378424c84b731eecb321378.gif"><br>  <i><a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/1592849-UX-Field-Research">Thanks to the beautiful author for a nice picture.</a></i> <br><br>  Why are we talking about foreign companies?  The qualitative methodology there has long ceased to be exotic and entered the arsenal of IT-productologists.  Studying their experience will allow you to better understand the possibilities and limitations of these methods in the field of UX.  For this, we conducted our own research. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The work was carried out in several stages.  First, selected foreign companies specializing in the development of IT-products.  It is clear that there are a lot of such companies in the western market.  We did not set goals to reveal all or select only the most famous ones.  What for?  It was more interesting for us to see what projects small and medium-sized companies are working on.  Although there are in the sample both large and well-known companies (for example, <a href="http://www.cooper.com/">Cooper</a> or <a href="https://blinkux.com/">Blink</a> ). <br><br>  We made a big list and began to check the companies for compliance with our criteria: we carefully studied the information on the About tab and the portfolio.  There were four main criteria. <br><ol><li>  This should be an independent company acting as a contractor.  We have excluded the UX-departments of large companies.  There, of course, conduct research.  And qualitative methods are used, but this is another story.  And other budgets. </li><li>  The company should provide services for the development of IT-products.  Not necessarily the "full cycle": its programmers in the state may not be. </li><li>  A company must use a qualitative methodology (interview, observation, ethnography).  It is not necessary that these were the only methods in the arsenal. </li><li>  On the website of the company should be cases.  Here there were the most problems: some companies came up according to the first three criteria, but instead of cases there were only customer logos on the site.  Logos - even if there are many - do not allow to understand the essence of the work. </li></ol><br>  We did not assess the level of competence of companies: we just needed to select the most suitable for our task - to analyze the experience of using qualitative methodology.  As a result, we selected 15 companies: <br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.redassociates.com/">ReD Associates</a> (Denmark, USA) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.experientia.com/">Experientia</a> (Switzerland, Italy, Singapore, United Kingdom, China, Taiwan) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.answerlab.com/">AnswerLab</a> (USA) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.cooper.com/">Cooper</a> (USA) </li><li>  <a href="https://www.spotless.co.uk/">Spotless</a> (United Kingdom) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.u1group.com/">U1</a> (Australia) </li><li>  <a href="http://teced.com/">TecEd</a> (USA) </li><li>  <a href="http://www.bowmast.com/">Bowmast / Nick Bowmast</a> (USA) </li><li>  <a href="https://www.headlondon.com/">Head</a> (UK) </li><li>  <a href="http://understandinggroup.com/">The Understanding Group</a> (USA) </li><li>  <a href="https://blinkux.com/">Blink</a> (USA) </li><li>  <a href="http://primemotive.com.au/">Prime Motive</a> (Australia) </li><li>  <a href="https://www.readingroom.com/">Reading Room</a> (UK) </li><li>  <a href="https://www.cxpartners.co.uk/">CX Partners</a> (United Kingdom) </li><li>  <a href="http://rma-consulting.com/">RMA</a> (UK) </li></ol><br>  That was enough for our purposes.  At the second stage, we started the primary analysis of cases.  And here we were waiting for a serious problem.  Companies are reluctant to reveal their internal kitchen, and the description of user analytics and their conclusions do not want to share at all.  It is clear: the whole focus in the cases only on the result.  Customers need to attract.  Such cases did not suit us.  We are not clients - we are interested in methods and principles of working with them, and then we will talk about the result.

      There were three problems with cases. <br><ol><li>  <b>In the description of the case only general information.</b>  What specific problem did the customer come from?  What was done to solve it?  Unclear.  Immediately on the results and talk in general terms. </li><li>  <b>Methods for collecting user data are not described.</b>  What is hidden behind the phrase ‚Äúwe studied users‚Äù or ‚Äúwe talked to users‚Äù?  What method was used: survey, focus group, observation, interview, or even web analytics?  It was important for us to select cases where qualitative methods were used.  We were not interested in quantitative methods, although in some cases they could supplement the qualitative methodology. </li><li>  <b>It is not clear how the data was used.</b>  For example, how did the study of the doctor‚Äôs workday affect the development of an application for hospital staff?  Only in a few cases, this is paid attention. </li></ol><br>  And yet we managed to select 26 cases.  They differ in the completeness of the description, and this is reflected in the text of the article.  Not all companies were able to offer a vivid history, which describes the use of analytics.  Somewhere there was a fairly dry report.  However, all cases contain real examples of the use of qualitative methodology in the development of IT products: a site, a mobile application, a professional interface, an online service.  The results of the work were different: recommendations, development strategies, concepts, prototypes or ready-made products.  We were interested in everything, because we also undertake very different projects. <br><br>  Despite these differences, the initial analysis of the selected cases immediately showed that we are dealing with six life situations. <br><ol><li>  Development of an IT product for a specific group of users. </li><li>  Developing a common platform for multiple user groups. </li><li>  Transition to a mobile platform. </li><li>  Development of a professional interface. </li><li>  Entering a new local market with an IT product. </li><li>  Development of a new service. </li></ol><br>  The use of qualitative methodology in these situations had its own characteristics: different goals, choice of research methods and final results.  The third stage of the study consisted in the analysis of these six situations and the identification of patterns in the use of qualitative methodology for solving product problems.  We focused on the following. <br><ul><li>  <b>Problems.</b>  What problem did the customer address?  What difficulties did the project team face? </li><li>  <b>Methods.</b>  What quality methods are chosen?  How was the study done? </li><li>  <b>The results.</b>  What user data could I get?  What is the use of these data?  How did they influence the development of an IT product? </li></ul><br>  All these points are important for understanding the experience of our foreign colleagues.  Life situations are arranged according to the increasing complexity of the task and the requirements for conducting qualitative research.  Let us turn to the results of our study. <br><br><h2>  ‚ÄúNot all of us are nine year old girls‚Äù: product development for a specific user group </h2><br>  Most IT products are developed to meet the needs of a specific group of users, development for an ‚Äúaverage person‚Äù is a rare case.  The success of a product for a particular user depends on how accurately his needs, expectations and pain are defined.  And how well this knowledge is used to create the product. <br><br>  What is the main difficulty?  In choosing a method and collecting data about users?  In the way of analyzing the collected data?  Or maybe in the use of the results?  These are all important questions, but it‚Äôs too early to talk about them. <br><br>  The main difficulty is to recognize that you do not represent your users.  Build hypotheses, draw beautiful models, but until you talk to users or watch them, you don‚Äôt know anything about them.  What do they care about?  What do they really need?  How is the reality of users different from your ideas? <br><br>  In some cases, such recognition is ‚Äúpainless‚Äù.  Here you have three illustrative case studies where project teams and customers have no question about whether to be or not to be explored. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Case 1. Cooper: Kurbo mobile app</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  Case 1. Cooper: <a href="http://www.cooper.com/work/kurbo">Kurbo mobile app</a> </h4><br>  Cooper needed to develop a mobile power monitoring application.  Similar applications already existed in the App Store and Google Play.  The problem was that the application was designed for children with overweight problems.  Children with it should independently monitor their diet.  So, you need to make the application clear and fun, otherwise the life of the child‚Äôs mobile device will be short.  It is clear that without studying the users such an application cannot be created. <br><br>  The company conducted the so-called in-person research - a study involving face-to-face communication.  It turned out that people who eat well prefer well-known foods.  And the child will not begin to understand exactly how the mother cooked the chicken - it is tiresome even for an adult.  The power control had to be made simple and interesting, and at the same time it was necessary to tell, and it was better to show what kind of food was good and what was not. <br><br>  How to make this application really fun?  Designer sessions with the participation of children helped to answer this question.  It turned out that every child wants to have a personal trainer with a unique voice and character.  The application had to satisfy this need. <br><br>  The team used the data to provide maximum user convenience.  The child could easily set goals for the week and follow them.  The ability to create a virtual trainer made the application more attractive.  In addition, the developers opened access to a web conference for children - there they could communicate with real trainers. <br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Case 2. Spotless: site for Disney</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  Case 2. Spotless: <a href="http://www.spotless.co.uk/clients/disney-channel-uk">site for Disney</a> </h4><br>  Disney Channel UK has a website where children - mostly girls 7-12 years old - can watch their favorite shows online.  The company decided to upgrade this site and add new features, but for this the developers did not have enough information about users.  It‚Äôs not so easy to understand how little girls live and how the site fits into their lives.  For this you need to study their behavior, habits and interests.  Such an analysis would determine the development strategy of the site.  And Disney turned to Spotless for help. <br><br>  The Spotless team took the task very seriously.  The study was organized in two countries: the UK and Spain.  In each country, conducted a diary study, three focus groups and eight interviews with small users. <br><br>  The diary study allowed us to gather the necessary contextual information about each participant in future focus groups and interviews.  In Spotless, they did their best: the team prepared comfortable and interesting diaries for children - bright, with pictures and colored stickers.  Filling out a diary was like doing homework.  The girls kept diaries for 4‚Äì7 days.  The data obtained more than compensated for the cost of developing the toolkit - now the researchers spoke the same language with the children.  They knew which characters, shows and events young users like the most.  This greatly helped to establish communication in the next stages of work. <br><br>  After the diary study, focus groups were organized by age: 7‚Äì8, 9‚Äì10, and 11‚Äì12 years old.  Children in groups were recruited in pairs - once together, the girlfriends felt more comfortable.  The moderator talked with the children, worked with them to sort the cards and evaluate the design with the help of emoticon stickers.  In addition, children performed tasks from various devices (laptop, iPad, iPod Touch and iPhone), assessing the convenience of the site. <br><br>  The final stage was the interviews at home, which were filmed on camera.  The researchers came to visit the children to talk about their habits and see what they usually do on their devices.  This helped to understand what children like and what prevents them from using the site.  Children's homes were also asked to perform several tasks on the site using various devices. <br><br>  Following the results of the work, Spotless compiled a report for Disney.  It contained information on site navigation, user routes, advertising, language, icons, design and layout, as well as valuable data on the usage environment and behavior of young users.  Since the interviews and focus groups were filmed, the customer received video materials on key research topics.  In addition, the report included an analysis of the merits and demerits of sites that the children visited regularly.  The developers of Disney Channel UK received all the necessary information about their users for the development of the site. <br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Case 3. Reading Room: Victim Support You &amp; Co website</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  Case 3. Reading Room: <a href="https://www.readingroom.com/work/victim-support-you-and-co/">Victim Support You &amp; Co website</a> </h4><br>  The Reading Room team received a daunting task from Victim Support - to create a website for children and teenagers who are victims of crime.  Children had to receive the necessary support and information (for example, on the types of crime and criminal justice).  The purpose of creating a resource is understandable, but what kind of help do children need when faced with a crime?  How to submit information?  How to structure it?  Too childish or patronizing tone can simply scare users away.  Answers to these questions required research. <br><br>  The team admits that it was very difficult to talk about such topics with children.  But without this it was impossible.  The researchers interviewed children and adolescents of different ages who are at different stages of criminal proceedings.  For more information, talked with support staff. <br><br>  The research results significantly influenced the structure of the site and its content. <br><ul><li>  An analysis of children's experience made it possible to understand that they can access the site at all stages of the criminal process.  And at each stage they should receive the necessary assistance.  The site must immediately provide the necessary information, without forcing to pass through a long chain of links. </li><li>  Going to court is an ordeal for a child.  To help users cope with this, an interactive courtroom was created on the site. </li><li>  Children treat police differently.  Often this attitude is negative.  Therefore, all references to the police were removed, and the main page made it clear that the resource was not related to the police. </li><li>  Children are often ashamed of what happened to them.  Sometimes after what happened they close themselves up and go to themselves.  The Victim Support team studied the experience of children who had already gone through this, wrote scripts and shot several videos on them with the participation of young actors.  This process helped to better understand the goals and objectives of the site users (children of different ages and their parents). </li></ul><br>  After studying users, creating characters and developing a digital strategy, a website with an interactive courtroom was created where children could get all the necessary information and prepare for what they were to do.  The developers have tried to make the site intuitive and comfortable for children.  In addition, he was adapted to work with mobile devices. <br></div></div><br><br><h3>  * * * </h3><br>  What unites these three cases?  All of them are quite rare situations when the project team is practically forced to conduct research.  Children are a special group of users, about which virtually nothing is known.  Showing imagination, we can remember other groups of this kind: people with disabilities, lonely elderly people, etc.  It is important that the need for research is not in doubt neither the customer nor the contractor.  In other cases, it is much more difficult to admit one's ignorance: it is very strong among product developers to have faith in their own total expertise. <br><br>  If we talk about the methodology of UX-research, these three cases show that the use of qualitative methods (interviews, observations, diary studies) provides valuable information that helps develop a high-quality IT product even for a specific group of users.  The team acquires the necessary knowledge and ceases to wander in the dark.  Reduced risk of getting a bad product. <br><br>  In addition, cases show that sometimes the team has to adapt the methodology to the characteristics of the user group (for example, diaries in the Spotless case), and in view of the complexity of the field work, the qualifications of the researcher must be very high.  If there are serious gaps in the ideas about the user, do not neglect joint design sessions (Cooper case). <br><br>  A doubting reader will say: yes, there are groups of users about which we know little, and there is no way to research it.  Children, who understand them at all?  But there are ordinary people who do things known to everyone.  For example, buy cars.  If you need a website for selling cars, why do research?  Deadlines are tight, the budget is limited.  Isn't it better to save time and money?  Let's see another case. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Case 4. TecEd: Ford Vehicles site</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  Case 4. TecEd: <a href="http://teced.com/clients/case-studies/ford-vehicles-website-research/">Ford Vehicles site</a> </h4><br>  The advertising agency J. Walter Thompson needed to update Ford‚Äôs website.  To do this work, it was necessary to understand how people make decisions about buying a car.  The agency believed that a high-quality website update is impossible without this information.  And everything would be fine, but only a month was spent on user research, and the budget was very limited.  Figures do not show, but we will take the word.  With this task, the agency staff turned to TecEd: to gain more in-depth knowledge about car buyers than given by web analytics and surveys.  Such was the request of the customer.  And this in the shortest possible time and with limited funds. <br><br>  The TecEd team accepted the task, but the working conditions required adapting the applied field methods for short-term user research.  Identified three key issues. <br><ol><li>  How do buyers search for information? </li><li>  What information attracts them? </li><li>  What prevents them from finding information? </li></ol><br>  This is the necessary minimum of knowledge about users for a qualitative change of the site.  To collect the necessary data, we conducted ten one-hour ethnographic interviews with people living outside Detroit. <br><br>  As a result, they identified and studied the key habits of customers, on which the design of the site directly depends.  As it turned out, it is very important for users that the site contains comparative tables.  The findings made it possible to change the site at all levels - from the main page to the salon page.  Usability testing of new pages showed that users began to find the necessary information faster.  Here is the practical value of the study. <br></div></div><br><br><h3>  * * * </h3><br>  And it's all?!  Conducted a study, and the results are so modest?  Waited for a revolution?  No revolution, just a convenient site for people for a specific task.  The use of qualitative methodology in the development of a product for a specific group of users does not always provide stunning results that allow for a breakthrough.  Moreover, the use of qualitative methodology itself is not a unique feature - it is part of the working routine in the production of a high-quality IT product.  The results of this work may seem trivial, but they bring real benefits to people.  Let's look at another case. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Case 5. The Understanding Group: Smart Beauty Guide website</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  Case 5. The Understanding Group: <a href="http://understandinggroup.com/how-we-work/case-studies/american-society-aesthetic-plastic-surgery/">Smart Beauty Guide website</a> </h4><br>  The American Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery) had two sites for patients that covered a variety of issues - from injections to complex operations.  However, existing sites did not quite satisfy the needs of users.  The company needed a new site that takes into account the interests of different user groups and provides a better user experience.  To solve this problem turned to The Understanding Group. <br><br>  The project team immediately took up interviewing users.  The results of the interview showed that the customer‚Äôs views about the site‚Äôs audience were partly erroneous.  The customer believed that there are two categories of users - novice and experienced.  So the logic prompted.  The data collected through interviews said that everything was more complicated.  For example, it turned out that among the users there are men who are interested in plastic surgery.  And there is a group of people for whom the main thing is to make the operation as comfortable as possible.  The site needed to take into account the needs of all categories of users. <br><br>  The second challenge was to provide a quality user experience.  This required the development of a user-friendly taxonomy.  Plastic surgeons use a lot of special terms, juggling synonyms, while the novice patient needs simple clear names.  For example, a breast augmentation procedure may be referred to as mammaplasty or breast plastics, and in addition, silicone or salt implants are often mentioned in connection with it.  A newbie will just get confused in all this variety.  The results of the interview, the analysis of keywords in search queries and the review of competitors were used to select the appropriate terminology and structure it. <br><br>  The results of the study were presented to the customer in the format of user portraits and scenarios.  Based on them, a new information structure was developed.  The new site was launched in 2013, and soon the number of users began to grow.  The number of pages viewed per session increased, people spent more time on the site and more often used feedback forms. <br></div></div><br><br><h3>  * * * </h3><br>  Again, no revolution and magic, just high-quality research work and useful, user-friendly IT product as its result.  In the last case there is an important point that could elude the reader's attention: at first the customer knew far from everything about his users.  That is why you need to conduct research, and not rely on their own expertise.  Perhaps the results will confirm your guesswork.  There is nothing wrong.  Worse, when your ideas are wrong, and you will know about it after the launch of the product.  Qualitative methodology helps to protect developers from such a danger.  Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research, even if the need for them is not as obvious as in the first three cases. <br><br>  After analyzing the experience of using qualitative methodology for developing a product for a specific group of users, we can draw the following conclusions. <br><ol><li>  Qualitative methodology provides valuable data on the needs, habits, fears and problems of users.  This knowledge is necessary for product development when the target audience is well known.  This knowledge is equally important if you need to make changes to an existing product to improve user experience. </li><li>  Sometimes the project team is faced with a complete lack of knowledge about users and their behavior necessary for the development of an IT product.  This is possible when creating a product for a specific group of users.  In such conditions, the team is forced to conduct research.  However, it is often necessary to adapt the methodology to work with an extraordinary group of users, and the requirements for the training of researchers are particularly high.  The results obtained can have a strong influence on the design of the IT product. </li><li>  Another, more common situation where the need for research is not obvious.  The reasons may be the proximity of the project team to a group of users, the ordinariness of their experience, or faith in their own total expertise.  In this case, it is necessary to conduct a study to confirm its expert assessment or to identify non-obvious needs of users.  Qualitative research will help protect developers from future problems with the finished IT product. </li></ol><br><hr>  <i>All parts of the article: <b>1</b> |</i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sobakapavlova/blog/307192/">2</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sobakapavlova/blog/307432/">3</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sobakapavlova/blog/307440/">4</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sobakapavlova/blog/307442/">5</a> |</i>  <i><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sobakapavlova/blog/307444/">6</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306946/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306946/</a></p>
