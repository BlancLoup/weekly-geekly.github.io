How Jabber has become today</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k2/fy/lx/k2fylxmuw4qyal1ijbzjtjxbygg.jpeg"><br><br>  Often when discussing messengers, when you mention XMPP, you can hear the words: <br><blockquote>  Hello from the two thousandth!  Does anyone else use an outdated protocol?  In XMPP there is still no delivery of files, messages, synchronization, beautiful clients? </blockquote><br>  The reason for the XMPP myths is that Jabber is known to many by messengers from the distant 2000s and poor awareness of the XMPP features.  Much time has passed since the 2000th, the protocol continued to exist and actively develop.  Modern Jabber is not much like the one that was before. <br><br>  In this article, we will look at why XMPP was created, discuss in comments the reasons for its decline in popularity and how Jabber has become today.

    <h3>  Prehistory </h3><br>  In the two thousand years, most Internet giants have deployed XMPP servers.  It was possible to write from one server to another, and now it seemed that if the technology could be slightly finished with e-mail 2.0, a universal instant messenger for the entire Internet, but then something went wrong. <a name="habracut"></a>  Companies have stopped updating XMPP clients.  There was no widespread announcement of XMPP support.  The servers gradually began to close the transfer of messages to others, and after all the technology was declared obsolete and support was turned off. <br><br><h3>  What was XMPP made for? </h3><br>  XMPP is an extensible messaging protocol.  XMPP was created as a universal means of interaction between different messengers.  It was assumed that large companies could add their extensions and seamlessly integrate their instant messengers and servers into a single network.  XMPP does not require full compatibility, with the exception of basic messaging and therefore no one can impose a certain technology stack on everyone. <br><br>  XMPP was considered as a replacement for e-mail.  Even the type of contact in XMPP looks like an e-mail address: user@example.com It was expected that government agencies and companies would use Jabber to quickly deploy their private communications systems.  Settings Jabber servers allow you to restrict access to the server and group chat outsiders or vice versa open.  On XMPP, you can create closed networks of servers, which is what NSA used.  Based on Snowden, XMPP is used as an internal communication tool: <br><blockquote>  He received a copy of his assault on his bodywork. <br>  Source: <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8qxdez/the-nsa-uses-the-same-chat-protocol-as-hackers-and-activists">motherboard.vice.com</a> </blockquote><h3>  Reasons for dropping XMPP </h3><br>  It would seem that the technology is promising, but large companies quickly lost interest in XMPP.  It was supposed that it would work in an ideal world, stumbled upon a harsh reality. <br>  The main material capital of any large Internet company is a user base.  Many companies have done their business by providing e-mail servers and closed messengers.  If it is relatively difficult to create an e-mail server, it is even more difficult to write your own messenger; anyone with a little knowledge of Linux can raise the XMPP server. <br><br>  Maintaining an open XMPP server means giving access to a client base to many small competitors.  I do not think that this situation could be liked by large companies and the investment stopped. <br><br><h3>  "Outdated and unnecessary XMPP to anyone" like a goldmine!  We close S2S, write clients and earn billions! </h3><br>  It is not known for certain who uses XMPP in their products.  Some evidence suggests that one of the most popular instant messengers, WhatsApp, used (or still uses) XMPP at the start of its existence. <br><blockquote>  The funniest thing to do.  Here is a post of Jan Koum mailing list: client access control: <br>  "Hi there, i installed ejabberd today, <br>  you all a couple of things ¬ª- <a href="https://blog.process-one.net/whatsapp-facebook-erlang-and-realtime-messaging-it-all-started-with-ejabberd/">blog.process-one.net</a> <br></blockquote>  The reason for this is easy to understand, because "outdated, redundant and unnecessary to anyone" XMPP stands 2,000,000 on one node!  If we discard populism, in particular we are talking about Ejabberd. <br><br>  <b>2,000,000 active compounds.</b>  <b>CPU load and memory consumption graph:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/957/057/147/957057147e8ce926708389ae60cf5ed8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Source: <a href="https://blog.process-one.net/ejabberd-massive-scalability-1node-2-million-concurrent-users/">blog.process-one.net</a> <br><br>  If Jabber ID is replaced with phone numbers, the subscriptions are compared with the presence of numbers in the address book, we get almost a completely finished product with a minimum of costs. <br><br>  Ejabber supports multiple databases and server connections, not only in the classic XMPP way, but through the Websocket, HTTP requests and the <a href="https://docs.ejabberd.im/developer/ejabberd-api/admin-api/">Ejabberd API</a> .  On Ejabberd, you can create an instant messenger with thousands of online connections on a cheap VPS, for a couple of dollars we get industrial resiliency and stability.  This favorably stands out Ejabberd, compared with many other messaging systems falling from low loads. <br><br>  Modified versions of XMPP are used by many proprietary messengers, for a quick start with a minimum of costs.  There are many examples of successful use of HMPP servers as a means of delivering messages.  The famous online game EVE Online <a href="https://www.eveonline.com/ru/article/p4i0qx/new-chat-backend-coming-with-the-march-release">recently transferred chat rooms</a> to Ejabberd.  Messenger Cryptocat is largely built on XMPP.  There are even rumors that the great and powerful Facebook somehow uses XMPP in their projects. <br><br><h3>  Previously, XMPP had a problem with message delivery and device synchronization, how is it solved now? </h3><br>  For message delivery in XMPP, the following extensions are used: <br><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html">XEP-0313: Message Archive Management</a></b> - message archive.  It is used for synchronization in case of a bad Internet channel where one device is periodically unavailable. </li><li>  <b><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0280.html">XEP-0280: Message Carbons</a></b> - forwards messages to all online devices.  Useful if the message archive is disabled in the Jabber-client settings. </li><li>  <b><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html">XEP-0198: Stream Management</a></b> - the server <b><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html">resends</a></b> messages if it does not receive delivery notifications.  Useful if the message archive is disabled in the Jabber-client settings. </li><li>  <b><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0160.html">XEP-0160: Best Practices for Handling Offline Messages</a></b> - storing messages until delivery.  Useful if the message archive is disabled in the Jabber-client settings. </li><li>  <b><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0333.html">XEP-0333: Chat Markers</a></b> - Mark the message delivery. </li></ul><br><h3>  Earlier in XMPP there was a problem with the delivery of files, how is it solved now? </h3><br><ul><li>  <b><a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0363.html">XEP-0363: HTTP File Upload</a></b> - files are uploaded to the server and transmitted as a link.  This link can be sent to anyone, even to those who do not have XMPP. </li></ul><br><h3>  How are things with beautiful clients in XMPP? </h3><br>  The concept of beauty is different for everyone.  Some people are beating and saying that their favorite <a href="https://gajim.org/screenshots.php%3Flang%3Dru">Gajim</a> , <a href="https://psi-plus.com/screenshots.php">PSI +</a> and even <a href="http://www.profanity.im/">Profany are the</a> most beautiful and the best, but on Android the generally recognized leader is Conversations. <br> <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Deu.siacs.conversations.legacy%26hl%3Den_US"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gx/xs/tb/gxxstbhedbkc7grclxvhpl9ahj0.png"><br></a> <br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Deu.siacs.conversations.legacy%26hl%3Den_US">Link</a> to other screenshots and page in the Play Store.  Note: In the Conversations settings, you can enable the display status of the interlocutor on the send button and the display status of message delivery.  Conversations.im server, selected by default, paid after 6 months of use.  For permanent use, it is better to choose another XMPP server, such as <a href="https://404.city/">404.city</a> .  City 404 is a cyberpunk community server.  404.city officially engaged in supporting compatibility with all versions of Conversations.  Well, or search server <a href="http://jabberworld.info/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%258E%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2_Jabber">here</a> . <br><br>  On Linux, Dino has high hopes, but while he is still in beta. <br> <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/download.html%3Fproject%3Dnetwork:messaging:xmpp:dino%26package%3Ddino"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uc/zj/i5/uczji5gb6bwziy3ulucdvwvwocs.png"><br></a> <br>  Website: <a href="https://dino.im/">dino.im.</a>  Installation packages: <a href="https://software.opensuse.org/download.html%3Fproject%3Dnetwork:messaging:xmpp:dino%26package%3Ddino">software.opensuse.org</a> <br><br><h3>  What are the features of XMPP?  Why do some things work fine, while others face difficulties? </h3><br><ul><li> Much depends on which server and client you use.  In XMPP decentralized development.  Server software, clients, extensions of standards are often written by different groups of people who do not interact directly with each other.  Over the 20 years of its existence, many clients and servers have appeared.  Some of them are already outdated, not serviced, created by amateurs.  Anyone who has a little knowledge of Linux can pick up a server.  Many people do not realize that Jabber is not a single messenger and server.  XMPP is similar to e-mail, as there are good and bad servers in e-mail, and XMPP also has good and bad servers.  With customers all the same. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yr/bk/p3/yrbkp3cugvqf49b2ydtyg1otqr0.jpeg"><br><br>  Experienced XMPP users, immediately after connecting to the server, look at the server capabilities in the settings of Jabber-clients. <br></li><li>  Do not use OTR encryption if you do not understand how it works.  In OTR, you only need to keep 1 device on and end conversations.  For newbies, OMEMO will be the easiest and most convenient in personal messages and group chats. </li></ul><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  XMPP is not as simple and outdated as it seems.  XMPP is the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcombining all instant messengers and sites (anyone can raise their server) as a single standard of communication.  XMPP is a great tool for creating fault-tolerant instant messengers in the hands of a developer.  Jabber is a good free alternative to WhatsApp and other instant messengers, in the hands of users familiar with the features of its work. <br><br>  XMPP is a topic that is difficult to describe in two words.
