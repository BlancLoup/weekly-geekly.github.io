The orbital ship was launched from the Baikonur cosmodrome with the help of the Energia launch vehicle.  After the flight over the Earth, Buran landed at the specially equipped ‚ÄúYubileyny‚Äù airfield at Baikonur.  The flight passed without a crew, completely in automatic mode.  Unlike the American Shuttle, which landed only on manual control.

But the most complete information is collected on the site <a href="http://www.buran.ru/">http://www.buran.ru</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebd/d5a/df3/ebdd5adf31b21409421df2399e612ae9.gif" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The ground control complex, the cerebral center of which is the TsUP, in the first flight of the Buran involved six ground tracking stations, four floating stations and a communication and data transmission system consisting of a network of land and satellite broadband and telephone communication channels.  To control the landing process, in addition to ground-based monitoring and control, we used our own on-board computer (On-board digital computer) of the Buran Beads-4.  The military order determined the architecture of the onboard computer - it was implemented as four parallel independent computing channels and a comparator, which continuously compared the results at the output of the channels.  In case of deviation of the results of any of the channels from the other three, it turned off and the on-board computer continued to operate in the normal mode.  In the same way, one more corrupted computational channel could be disabled, thus achieving automatic backup and fault tolerance of the on-board computer.  <b>Computational channels (or cores, in modern terminology) operated at 4 MHz and had 128 KB of RAM and 16 KB of permanent program memory</b> .  Such an architecture allowed the onboard computers to control the landing process of the Buran even in the conditions of a nuclear war (this was part of the TK at the request of the military). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">little more about the onboard computer</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  1. Buran computing system consisted of two systems: <br>  - The central computing system consisting of 4 onboard computers of Beads-4 type. <br>  - Peripheral computing system, consisting of 4 Beads-4 onboard computers. <br><br>  2. The names "central" and "peripheral system is in some sense conditional, since they were exactly the same. <br><br>  3. Four Beads-4 onboard computers worked synchronously, using the same programs. <br>  It was a four-time hardware backup.  In case of any two failures, the Buran control system was to ensure the fulfillment of critical tasks: saving the crew‚Äôs life and returning Buran to Earth. <br><br>  4. Unlike the Americans, who used the SOFTWARE synchronization of four on-board computers (on-board computers), we used the HARDWARE synchronization of four Beads-4 type of on-board computers.  For this purpose, a five-fold redundant crystal oscillator was developed, which produced the output frequency according to the voting scheme THREE OF FIVE (3 out of 5).  This ultra-reliable quartz oscillator (five channels of which, of course, were synchronized with each other) gave out the frequency simultaneously to all 4 Beads-4 type on-board computers. <br><br>  5. From the very beginning, in the huge rack, in which the equipment was placed on board the Buran, 8 seats were provided, where you could ‚Äúpush in‚Äù 8 Beads-4 on-board computers. <br><br>  4. During the first (and only) flight of Buran, only the Central Computing System was used (only 4 onboard computers of Beads-4 type).  Peripheral system is not used.  This means that only 4 Beads-4 devices were inserted into the bookcase.  The remaining 4 seats for the four onboard computers of the peripheral system were empty and closed with plugs. <br><br>  5. In the second launch of Buran (which never took place), the number of flight tasks increased.  The power of one of the four on-board computers was not enough, and the peripheral system was again introduced into the instrumentation of the control system, that is, another four on-board computers were added, such as Beads. <br><br>  6. Preparation for the second launch of Buran was in full swing.  But the collapse of the USSR led to the cessation of work. <br><br>  7. About the language of DRAGON.  Here we have to talk a lot and in detail.  But I will confine myself to one mention. <br><br>  Consider the task of managing the survival of the fourfold rezerised four of the on-board computers Beads-4 when one, two and three of the on-board computers fail.  From the outside, this task may seem rather simple.  In fact, it is not.  To solve this problem, a program was provided, which was called PPN (Reliability Improvement Program).  Larisa Dmitrievna Tyurina developed this program in my laboratory.  It was developed on DRAGON.  But then it was the ‚Äúpaper‚Äù DRAGON.  In fact, it was a detailed algorithm on DRAGON.  Larisa gave it to the programmers, and they coded it on the assembler BISER-4. <br><br>  Taken <a href="">from here</a> <br></div></div><br><br>  When developing Buran, the problem of developing and developing software was considered one of the most difficult.  Initially it was assumed that several thousand programmers would be required to solve the problem. <br><br>  The software was created at the Scientific and Production Center for Automation and Instrumentation named after Academician N..  Pilyugin and at the Institute of Applied Mathematics.  Mv  Keldysh. <br><br>  After studying the problem, it was decided to develop problem-oriented languages ‚Äã‚Äãbased on the terms, concepts and presentation of the control and test algorithms used by the ship's developers.  The implementation of these languages ‚Äã‚Äãmade it possible to create the onboard and test software of the ship developers themselves - the authors of the control and test algorithms - to create.  The development of languages ‚Äã‚Äãand related tools was carried out by a small team of highly qualified programmers of the Institute of Applied Mathematics in an extremely short time. <br><br>  For the development of on-board software, the specialized real-time language PROL2 and the automation system for programming and debugging SAPO PROL2 were created.  To ensure the operation of control algorithms, an on-board operating system was created that successfully worked during the first unmanned flight of the ship. <br><br>  For the development of ground testing software for the ship, the problem-oriented language DIPOL and the programming and debugging automation system based on it were created.  To ensure the operation of the test algorithms, an Automated Test System was created ... <br><br>  In addition, in the Pilyugin Center under the leadership of Konstantin Fedorov, the LAX language for modeling was developed. <br><br>  Over time, it became clear that the abundance of languages ‚Äã‚Äãhinders the cause.  There was a proposal to replace these three languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith one universal language - <a href="http://drakon.su/">DRAGON</a> (Friendly Russian Algorithmic Language, which Provides Visibility). <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The dragon was created gradually, in three stages.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Stage 1. In 1984, the FLOX language was developed at the Pilyugin Center (as the declarative part of the PROL2 language, describing the terms and concepts used in the development of control and test algorithms used by the developers of the Buran ship).  In addition, the FLOX database was created. <br><br>  The author of the language FLOX was Vladimir Parondzhanov. <br>  The author of the database is Vladislav Baltru≈°aitis. <br>  The developers of the algorithms issued to programmers tasks for developing programs in the PROL2 language in the form of partially formalized flowcharts supplied with phlox identifiers and phlox descriptions. <br>  These flowcharts were a simplified prototype of the Dragon language.  But the name Dragon at that time was not used yet. <br><br>  Stage 2. There was an unexpected situation.  For the same concepts of Buran, the languages ‚Äã‚ÄãPROL2, Dipole and LAX had different identifier systems, which was extremely inconvenient. <br>  It soon became clear that phlox identifiers have absolute advantages.  As a result, the Dipole identifiers and LAX identifiers were discarded as completely unnecessary.  Phlox identifiers won a complete and final victory. <br><br>  Stage 3. The unity of identifiers in the three languages ‚Äã‚Äã(PROL2, DIPOLE, LAX) gradually led to the proposal to abandon the three languages ‚Äã‚Äãand replace them with one universal language. <br><br>  This idea was expressed in 1986 by the head of the integrated department Yuri Trunov (later General Designer and General Director of the Pilyugin Center). <br><br>  Trunov commissioned the creation of a new language to Vladimir Parondzhanov, head of the laboratory for the integrated development of the Buran computer system. <br><br>  The gradual transformation of partially formalized flowcharts (which were used as input data for the development of programs in the PROL2 language) into a strictly formalized language, called DRAKON, began. <br><br>  The development of the Dragon language and its software lasted for about 10 years (1986-1996).  During this time, the technology of development of algorithms and programs "Grafit-Flox" was created. <br><br>  All work on the GRAFIT-FLOKS system was completed by 1996.  Then she went into service. <br>  With its help, algorithms and programs of the Sea Launch project were developed.  In total, the development and testing of software and other elements of the Sea Launch Project Management System took three years. <br><br>  DRAGON is not a dead tongue.  It is used mainly in the space field.  It was used to create software for Phobos-Soil, the Fregat upper stage, and to upgrade the Proton-M launch vehicle.  Used in the NPO.  Lavochkin to create a lunar module. <br></div></div><br><br>  Let us dwell on the features of the language DRAGON: <br>  1. DRAGON - graphic (visual) language. <br>  2. Rigid standardization allows synthesizing program code according to flowcharts. <br>  3. The language is very light and well thought out.  Sharpened for practical tasks. <br>  4. Much easier UML.  We can say that UML is for object-oriented programming, and Dragon-schemes for procedural programming. <br><br>  In order not to engage in crossposting, I will leave a link to the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25A0%25D0%2590%25D0%259A%25D0%259E%25D0%259D">Wiki</a> with a brief description of the language. <br><br>  All material is taken from sites: <br>  <a href="http://www.buran.ru/">http://www.buran.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="http://drakon.su/">http://drakon.su/</a> <br>  <a href="http://forum.oberoncore.ru/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D62%26t%3D1252">http://forum.oberoncore.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="http://transhumanism-russia.ru/content/view/331/110/">http://transhumanism-russia.ru/</a> <br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25A0%25D0%2590%25D0%259A%25D0%259E%25D0%259D">http://ru.wikipedia.org/</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/202332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/202332/</a></p>
