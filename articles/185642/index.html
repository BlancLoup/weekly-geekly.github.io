He was pleased with the unfavorable buns in the form of a free server, apache, php, mysql, ruby, python, consoles in the web interface, convenient similarity of IDE in the browser and other nice things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bf8/562/09c/bf856209cf901bc32acbabcf08f6efd8.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the social component, the developers promised more and more innovations, applications and project development.  As promised, all that was supplied in the beta version will remain free at the time of release (although it‚Äôs not a release, as it were). <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h2>  What do we have now? </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71e/c45/9be/71ec459be70940c7b16147f20df242f2.png"><br><br>  Such statistics are shown to us on the main page of the service. <br><br>  With the project participants everything is clear.  Then there are data on Topics (analogue of the hubs on the Habr√©), the number of running virtual machines, and something like the activity of the participants, for ‚ÄúGeneral thoughts‚Äù.  Groups - a relatively recent innovation. <br><br>  About virtual machines.  Earlier (at the time of the beta) you just had a daddy on the server, which you could access via http using your_book.koding.com template, well, you could work with it via ftp, or through a fairly convenient webmord.  Now everything is somewhat different.  By default you have nothing.  But you can create an unlimited number of virtual machines to work with them.  The first is free.  The remaining $ 5 per month. <br><br>  For machines, backups, an application for migration from the beta version, to the full (selected VM) are provided. <br><br>  The guys did a good job on the front-end service.  This is extremely noticeable in the form of reduced brakes for animation rendering and project work in general. <br><br><h2>  Applications </h2><br>  Previously, the application page was a sheet with a bunch of "coming soon", which for a year has not changed.  The only application at the time was <a href="http://ace.ajax.org/">ace editor</a> (by the way a cool thing).  Now the range has become richer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9cb/ff5/4b7/9cbff54b74764e037cc2877ce48290f4.png"><br><br><h2>  Groups </h2><br>  Groups mean not only the social component.  You can create a virtual machine for a group and limit the circle of people to use it.  For this, there is its own pricing policy (the essence of which I am not completely cutting). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/57c/c06/071/57cc0607124651ae33e6bf20b0c56ff6.png"><br><br><h2>  Trifle, but nice </h2><br>  Two levels of tabs appeared in the interface.  The first is running applications.  The second is the subtabs for the editor, which you can now drag and drop as browser-based.  The absence of this previously brought some inconvenience.  The file tree is also not spared.  Now you can change the structure of folders and files by dragging them with the mouse.  Previously, such manipulations were possible only in the form of cut / copy -&gt; paste or via ftp client. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e51/4be/f53/e514bef53e46e93e55ba59c381e5b621.png"><br><br><h2>  Slight disappointment </h2><br>  For me, this service was convenient because I dumped all sorts of layouts and scripts there to show the customer.  But today I found a stub on my VM, which meant that the car was stopped because  the developer has not used it for the last 15 minutes.  Those.  now we use it solely for the purpose of team or individual development and testing of the project.  No blozhikov. <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> The appearance of the stub was noticed by me only a few times that night.  In the discussion below, information appears that no stubs were observed.  It is not clear.  Time will tell. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> After another 15 minutes, she appeared. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e5c/dec/4ab/e5cdec4ab3b9510787005aa84f4cdbaf.png"><br><br><h2>  Not yet release </h2><br>  Not all the functions of the service work to the fullest, you can find type labels (Not available on Private Beta), but everything is going to be released.  The project is sawing, and he actively lives, not choking.  I will not say that I became interested in the social part of the project, but as a cloud-based development environment, I was completely attracted and I would use it. <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> : Kodepad application allows you to write your own applications for the service Koding.com </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185642/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185642/</a></p>
