    <h1>  During our absence, we managed to do 2 very important things, about which we will tell: </h1><br><ul><li>  visual analytics of calls </li><li>  new comfortable script tree </li></ul><br><br>  In combination with high-quality integration with data about contacts, companies, deals, leads from CRM, this makes the Script Builder not just a prompter (which already appeared quite a lot), but the only <b>comprehensive tool for increasing sales</b> at the moment. <br>  (If you do not have CRM - start with the <a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/apps/%3Fapp%3Dkitmedia.callhelper%26p%3D211275">version for Bitrix24</a> , CRM for 12 and users absolutely free) <br><br><h1>  So, the first thing that the users asked us for (and we ourselves didn‚Äôt have enough) was a visual analytics. </h1><br><br>  Each sales manager knows that in order to find a problem in telephone sales, you need to listen to hundreds of calls, manually turn it into some kind of structured data about the call process, and then, building on them, build hypotheses. <br>  It is even more difficult to look for optimization methods when everything seems to be good - dependencies can be very unclear. <br><br>  Of course, it would be impossible to do without listening to the records, but we made a tool that allows you to quickly put forward hypotheses and then listen to only the necessary calls to make sure of the assumptions. <br><br>  <i><b>The first type of presentation is tabular statistics:</b></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae6/fa9/700/ae6fa9700fbe44e78a0f1588ebbfab2e.png"></div><br><br>  In the table we see: the start time of the call, the duration, the script with which they worked, the operator (manager) who called, the result with which the call ended, the number of steps for the script, the manager's comment on the script, a link to view the call. <br><br>  <i><b>Next - more interesting, namely, viewing the progress of the call:</b></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/672/21c/71f/67221c71f12447c88ddc285cc6cbb336.png"></div><br><br>  We see the path of the call by the script - indicated by red lines, the order of steps is numbered.  Immediately you can see how the conversation went, what were the objections. <br>  At the end we see the node on which the conversation ended and the icon of the type of result. <br><br>  <i><b>Even more interesting is the summary statistics on the script:</b></i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/420/211/7cf/4202117cfac9434d82632a048cb6e771.png"></div><br><br>  Right on the script tree, we see which nodes most often turned the conversation over and with what results, on which node, and how much the conversation ended. <br>  In the table and in the diagram, we can use filters by script, manager, or several managers and period. <br>  Using these tools in particular, it is easy to determine which of the managers does not work exactly according to the script. <br><br><h1>  In addition, we completely reworked the script constructor tree: </h1><br><ul><li>  Now when writing a script, you can transfer nodes and branches to the right place in the structure.  In addition to convenience, it allows you to work with the designer as with MindMap and effectively think through the logic of the conversation, without using other applications. </li><li>  Nodes and entire branches can be duplicated if much of the script is repeated with minor changes. </li><li>  Additional transitions are now visible in the script tree (this is when the answer is using an already existing script node, and not just the next one after the current one).  Understanding the logic of the built script has become easier (colored lines in the screenshots). </li><li>  Added quick menu for creating, deleting, duplicating nodes and script branches. </li></ul><br><br>  At the moment it seems to us that we have finished with the basic tools that influence the efficiency of using telephone scripts. <br>  But we are not going to stop there - soon there will be new integrations and improvements of important details, so that work becomes even more efficient. <br>  Did you miss something?
