  <section class="page js-page"><h1>I resent: Infobox!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Before the holidays, we wanted to launch our fairly powerful system for debugging, a large weighty script and a parser of an online store with a catalog of several million items. <br>  Personally, I always used foreign data centers with their rental cars, but then we decided that traffic to our store would be 99% from Russia, and therefore, including to increase throughput, we decided to take the server from the infbox. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>The first day.</strong> <br><br>  It all started prosaically.  We needed to find and launch a rented server within a couple of hours.  At first I called Infobox and asked about the conditions and speed.  I was promised that the server will be installed immediately after payment within literally a couple of hours, which is what we needed.  Moreover, we were promised more memory, and in general conditions are better. <br>  Then the blockbuster began.  We could only pay by bank transfer from the account of our legal entity, and neither the letter of guarantee nor the copy of the payment was for the infobox proof of our payment for services.  Moreover, due to the fact that we are ‚Äúthe first time customers‚Äù (literally in the payment department, they said so), we will be installed and set up the server ONLY after receiving confirmation of payment. <br><br>  <strong>Second day.</strong>

      <br>
      By one o'clock a letter came, saying that they got the money, we set up the server. <br>  Half an hour later, a letter arrived that we could not build a server in this configuration, so they recommend that we ‚Äúinstall Celeron 2.8 GHz for the same price‚Äù.  And we ordered xeon.  For the same price ... <br>  Well, I call back, I am surprised, I am a little perplexed, and they answer: ‚Äúoh, sorry, I sent the wrong message.  everything is in the contract with your server, I just collect it ‚Äù:-) <br>  OK.  We wait.  We receive the letter, by 18:00 the server will be installed. <br>  Satisfied, we rub hands, we wait for the scheduled hour, in passing reading positive reviews scattered on the Internet about the work of Infobox. <br><br>  <strong>17:57</strong> , the letter comes: "The server is configured, IP addresses are registered, everything is OK."  There is no response from ip-addresses.  Route password by mail is not sent.  We look forward to the next. <br><br>  <strong>23:50</strong> , the letter comes: ‚ÄúThey say, so and so, technical problems.  Decide - decide.  We will answer no later than 13:00 the next day. ‚Äù  We get angry, swear to ourselves, read positive feedback about Infobox, get angry, indignant, drink cognac. <br><br>  <strong>Third day.</strong> <br><br>  Saturday morning, the watch that way at 13:00, I decided to see if there was any chance to hear from the hoster.  Miracle!  Server is running!  Comments: "Yes, there were problems, reinstalled debian, everything is OK, use."  Gorgeous.  It is useful to put the first apt-get ... <br><br>  Needless to say, source.list had to be shopped, since everything was set up on the CDROM, and, of course, no mention of the debian repository.  Figs with him, set everything you need, rebutted, all like a clock.  Sparkles glitter.  I give the programmers to the mercy of a server, they say, pour your software. <br><br>  <strong>Day four.</strong> <br><br>  The programmer is calling.  Cold sweat coders emerges through the cool metal mobile panel ... A server fell.  I'm out of town, only gprs access to the Internet, I can not control the situation.  I remotely explain how to enter the admin area, and what questions to ask the hoster in such cases.  And with a clear conscience I finish the conversation. <br><br>  <strong>Fifth day, Monday, Apotheosis.</strong> <br><br>  Got to the city with fast internet.  I climb to watch the mail and news about our car.  I read the correspondence: <br>  ‚ÄúYou have exceeded incoming traffic, pay 183 rubles.  the ratio of 4 to 1 is not met, etc. ‚ÄùI think for a long time, I climbed to the ip-address, there is no response.  Support says, "pay." <br>  10 gigov weighs the program and the base.  In order to get started, you must either pay 850 rubles (per hour) for entering the data center, and for connecting our drive to the rental car in order to transfer the software.  Or, pay for incoming traffic in the amount of our software.  We are indignant, we swear for a long time, we think, we read positive news about Infobox, we think, we think, we are indignant, we swear.  We call, restart even the machine, figs with it, we will pay the traffic ... <br>  Do you know what they said to us? <br>  ‚ÄúThe services you paid for include only installation and initial configuration of the server.  In order to reboot it by our forces, you need to pay our additional work in the amount of 850 rubles per hour. ‚Äù <br>  In other words, ‚Äúwe are very concerned about the problems of <s>blacks</s> clients, if you want everything to work well and well, pay us for support 65,000 a month, and you will be happy, we will carry your server and all that. <br><br>  We threw almost 7 thousand rubles to the wind, got a lot of negativity before the holidays, and now I urgently need to pick up at least something with 8 gigs of RAM abroad.  OK‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Not that we are greedy, no, not at all.  Just a few years of renting cars in the same Holland and Germany taught us that we pay for real work, for uptime, and for customer-oriented, adequate technical support. <br>  How long the excess profits can go on (it‚Äôs not very difficult to calculate the costs, right?) <br><br>  <strong>I resent.</strong> <br><br>  <strong>update:</strong> <br>  I received the same insider information :-) Very interesting and useful.  I will not quote fully, only with excerpts: <br><br>  <i>"... the big bosses came and began to redo everything in their own way ... there is now quite rotten ..."</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>"... at the moment infobox is a company that spins on managers, not on IT-specialists - the outcome is clear. From there, all normal people have already fled ..."</i> <br>  (I‚Äôm not going to indicate the insider author for obvious reasons) <br><br>  As I understand it, both clients and employees fled.  The rest of them break down the data center in every sense of the word and from all sides. <br>  Infobox, if you don‚Äôt fix it, we‚Äôll start exerting public pressure through bloggers and through the media. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79641/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79641/</a></p>
