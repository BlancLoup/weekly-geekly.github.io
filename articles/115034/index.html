And even people far from the world of games are familiar with the capabilities of their technologies, which have been used for more than 10 years to create special effects for the best Hollywood blockbusters. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><blockquote>  The physics engine is a computer program that simulates the physical laws of the real world in the virtual world with varying degrees of approximation.  Game physics engines are used in computer games as a component of the game engine.  In this case, it should work in real time, that is, to reproduce the physical processes in the game with the same speed at which they take place in the real world.  However, the accuracy of calculations is not required from the game physics engine.  The main requirement is visual realism. <br><a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA"></a>  Wikipedia </blockquote><br>  At the moment, the Havok physics engine is the second most popular in the world.  Some intrigue is made by the fact that the company that developed the PhysX engine that overtook it belongs to Nvidia, which had tried in its time with Intel and bought Havok. <br><br><h4>  Unity partnership </h4><br>  The PhysX engine is built into Unity3D editor at California-based <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity Technologies</a> , a leader in the mobile gaming platform development industry.  Unity3D is a powerful and functional game development tool that is used by more than 350,000 developers worldwide.  Unity's customers include small independent studios as well as major publishers like Electronic Arts, Warner and Cartoon Network, or Bigpoint (the Battler Star Gallactica browser game announced a month ago. <br><br>  Multiplatformity Unity3D allows you to easily run your games on iOS, Android, PS3, XBOX, Wii, PC and Mac.  And now Sony Ericsson smartphones have appeared on this list - becoming another major partner of the company in the world of game development, Unity allows you to create games already adapted to PLAY controls in Unity3D. <br><br>  Here, for example, how on Xperia PLAY is the game Guerilla Bob from Angry Mob Games developed on the Unity engine: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/YPLBPVG7OnU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg8-LJkcPpuLjPmHchbWF_xE6YAhg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Development strategy </h4><br>  Attracting not only publishers, but also developers of engines and other gaming infrastructure, investing not only in marketing, but also in technology, Sony Ericsson, in fact, creates a kind of ecosystem around the PLAY model, a nutrient environment in which growth and development are possible. new products - gaming smartphones on Android, bearing the stigma of PlayStation Certified. <br><br>  This is not a pioneer of gaming phones - they were other companies.  Rather, it is a locomotive, a locomotive that will pull the rest and the whole industry into a new niche.  Like, for example, most recently, James Cameron, having shot his Avatar, changed the film industry, turning 3D from a rare attraction into an influential trend of the decade and the most promising direction in the development of film production. <br><br>  To make it clearer, how serious and with what scale Sony Ericsson is coming to a new project, here is just a list of partners forming the biocenosis around the Xperia Play and PlayStation suite: <br><ul><li>  Sony Computer Entertainment </li><li>  Digital chocolate </li><li>  Digital legends </li><li>  Electronic arts </li><li>  Fishlabs </li><li>  Gamehouse </li><li>  Gameloft </li><li>  Glu mobile </li><li>  Handy games </li><li>  Namco Bandai Networks </li><li>  Polarbit </li><li>  Popcap </li><li>  Trendy entertainment </li><li>  Unity technologies </li></ul><br>  The expanded list of games, from those more than fifty, which will be available in the market at the start of sales: <br><ul><li>  Bruce Lee: Dragon Warrior </li><li>  Star battalion </li><li>  Asphalt adrenaline </li><li>  The sims 3 </li><li>  FIFA 2010 (with multiplayer) </li><li>  Guitar Hero 6 </li><li>  Gun bros </li><li>  Super KO Boxing </li><li>  Tetris (where do without it) </li><li>  Assassins creed </li><li>  Galaxy on Fire 2 </li><li>  Guns &amp; glory </li><li>  Real football </li><li>  Modern Combat 2 </li><li>  Dungeon Defender - second wave </li><li>  Need for Speed ‚Äã‚Äã- Shift </li><li>  Wreckless racing </li><li>  Raging thunder </li></ul><br>  The list of PS one games that will be available very soon for downloading on the Android market: <br><ul><li>  Crash Bandicoot </li><li>  Siphon filter </li><li>  MediEvil </li><li>  Rally cross </li><li>  Cool boarders 2 </li><li>  Wildarms </li><li>  Destruction Derby </li><li>  Jumping flash </li></ul><br>  In general, if you got the impression that Sony Ericsson in the mobile gaming industry is serious and for a long time, then you are not mistaken. <br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  The gaming industry has adopted Xperia Play.  Now move for the consumer. <br><br>  The cost of games will be from 4.99 to 7.99 euros - the final cost will be determined by the developer.  Access to games will be only on PlayStation Certified devices.  The average size of the game is 200 MB, with a memory card size of 8 GB (with the possibility of expansion up to 16 GB and 32 GB). <br><br>  The assets of the smartphone are multiplayer (via wi-fi), cross-platform games and games specially designed for PLAY - in fact, Xperia PLAY opens up a huge new market for PlayStation Certified devices.  As SonyEricsson players themselves say, ‚ÄúXperia PLAY opens up a new, mobile dimension for a whole range of games,‚Äù first available only for consoles, and gives you truly exciting mobile game experiences. <br><br>  PLAY will launch its promotion to the heart of the consumer from across the ocean - another news last week was the announcement on March 2 of Xperia PLAY as the official phone of the American e-sports league <a href="http://www.majorleaguegaming.com/">Major League Gaming</a> .  This event is of equal importance to the choice of Formula1 race car - in the race, it seems, is not participating, but it constantly hits the broadcast screens. <br><br>  In addition, Xperia PLAY is supported by several major cellular operators around the world, including Verizon and O2.  What is the profit of cellular companies - it is clear, traffic, traffic and traffic again.  But for the sales of PLAY such powerful support will not hurt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54a/90a/1d3/54a90a1d39abc7dbd103546b8075d8d2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>See you again!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115034/</a></p>
