  <section class="page js-page"><h1>[bookmark] JS developer tools to pay attention to</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The programmer Travis Fisher, whose translation of the article we are publishing today, decided to tell about the most useful modules from his point of view and auxiliary tools for JS development.  He considers the technologies he uses constantly and useful in the value of which he was convinced by his own experience as useful.  In particular, we will focus on libraries and utilities designed for server and client development in JavaScript.  Travis says that he did not strive to include something highly specialized in his material, or to do something like another <a href="https://awesomelists.top/">awesome list</a> , which themselves are very useful, but usually turn out to be somewhat overloaded.  Here we will talk only about the best that he can recommend with complete confidence to others. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ruvds/blog/351480/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aca/9ff/f8b/aca9fff8b1c18be3aa32795469578d71.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Command line tools</font> </h2><br>  Let's start with some extremely useful command line tools. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçNp</font> </h3><br>  The <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/np">np</a> command is a very good alternative to <code>npm publish</code> .

      If you publish your development in npm, I highly recommend looking at <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/np">np</a> , as this command line tool greatly simplifies the versioning process, helps you work with git-release tags and publish packages in npm, especially if it happens that you support more than pairs of modules.  Also, if you are interested in the <code>np</code> utility, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/zeit/release">release</a> tool created by <a href="https://zeit.co/">Zeit</a> .  It is designed to automate the publication of releases of GitHub projects. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/798/1e0/4ab/7981e04abd4b14287c5400a027d40e60.gif"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Publish package using np (image source - <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/">Sindre Sorhus</a> )</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçYarn</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">Yarn</a> is a package manager that is compatible with npm and features advanced features. <br>  Although npm <a href="http://blog.npmjs.org/post/161081169345/v500">v5 is</a> much faster than its previous versions, I still, for local development, prefer yarn for its speed and stability.  In any case, using yarn, you work with the same databases of modules as when using npm, while it is impossible to say with certainty - which is better - yarn or npm.  Choose the manager that best meets the needs of your project.  I suppose, the one who is engaged in JS-development should learn npm and yarn. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçPrettier</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://prettier.io/">Prettier</a> is a tool for formatting code. <br><br>  Prettier allows you to maintain a uniform style of code, reducing the text of programs to the form given by its rules, which, in particular, take into account the maximum permissible length of the line, transferring the code to a new line where it is needed. <br><br>  I like <a href="https://eslint.org/">eslint</a> , and I, in particular, have long used the JavaScript <a href="https://standardjs.com/">Standard Style</a> , but the ideas on which the automatic tools for formatting the code, like <a href="https://prettier.io/">prettier</a> and <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">gofmt</a> , are <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/">built</a> , seem to me very attractive. <br><br>  Developers spend too much energy thinking about the presentation and styling of the code, while the <a href="https://prettier.io/">prettier</a> eliminates the need for such reflections.  Automatic code formatting allows programmers to focus on what they write and not think about how it should look. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95d/af0/4cd/95daf04cd3c3b3ea71ed547dc271536b.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Prettier (image source - <a href="https://github.com/prettier/prettier">Prettier</a> )</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçNow</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://zeit.co/now">Now</a> is an extremely simple code deployment system created by Zeit. <br><br>  Now is the best of the existing systems for deploying projects, considering factors such as simplicity, reliability and functionality.  It is great for different situations and scales well with the growth of project needs.  And, by the way, it is free as long as you do not need its ability to scale. <br><br>  Now is suitable for working with web applications written in JS, using Node.js as the server side.  In addition, I recommend looking at other <a href="https://zeit.co/">Zeit</a> designs.  This company produces decent products thanks to a strong team of JS-developers. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fd/e70/ba7/3fde70ba7ebf1d624f8b58e42eb1975d.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Zeit (image source - <a href="https://zeit.co/">Zeit</a> )</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçAsciinema</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://asciinema.org/">Asciinema</a> is a free tool for high-quality recording of what is happening in the terminal. <br><br>  <a href="https://hackernoon.com/presenting-your-code-beautifully-fdbab9e6fb68">Here is</a> my material on this topic, devoted to the analysis of the features of using <a href="https://asciinema.org/">asciinema</a> to create high-quality, professional-looking code demonstrations and screencasts. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Promises</font> </h2><br>  This section deserves a separate article, especially now that the <a href="https://zeit.co/blog/async-and-await">async / await</a> mechanism has begun to become the de facto standard in the field of parallel programming in JavaScript.  Having noted this, I highly recommend a look at the excellent collection of tools for working with promises presented by the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/promise-fun">promise-fun</a> module from <a href="https://sindresorhus.com/">Sindre Sorhus</a> . <br><br>  The only thing I would like to warn you about is that these tools probably won't work without additional settings with most frontend tools like <a href="https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app">create-react-app</a> or <a href="https://rollupjs.org/">rollup</a> . <br><br>  Here are some useful tools for working with promises and asynchronous code in the Node.js environment. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçPify</font> </h3><br>  The <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/pify">pify</a> package is a means for converting callback functions to promises. <br><br>  There are many ways to convert callback functions to promises, but I found out that <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/pify">pify</a> is the best thing that exists in this area.  This is a small module that has some nice little things like built-in automatic binding methods, which is missing in the standard <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/util.html">util.promisify</a> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçP-map</font> </h3><br>  The <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-map">p-map</a> module is designed to organize parallel work with promises. <br><br>  Parallel code execution is a very useful technique, but in practical use it is necessary to set limits, because otherwise, for example, too many parallel network requests can overload the network or require too much system resources.  It is in such situations that the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-map">p-map</a> shows itself in all its glory.  I use it, almost always, as a replacement for the <code>promise.all(‚Ä¶)</code> construct, which does not support the assignment of constraints. <br><br>  Before I learned about <code>p-map</code> , I created <a href="https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/async-await-parallel">something similar on my</a> own, but I recommend <code>p-map</code> to everyone, since this tool is definitely better than my design. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçP-retry</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-retry">P-retry</a> allows <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-retry">you</a> to re-execute asynchronous functions or functions that return promises. <br><br>  Usually, I wrap any HTTP requests and external service calls in <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-retry">p-retry</a> in order to equip the code with basic fault tolerance mechanisms.  In combination with this <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-map">p-map</a> tool, you can handle large sets of requests to external resources, controlling the parallel execution of such requests and not particularly worrying about intermittent errors during transmission of data, such as those caused by socket problems or server timeouts. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçP-timeout</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-timeout">P-timeout</a> completes a failed <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-timeout">timeout</a> promise. <br><br>  The <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-timeout">p-timeout</a> module, along with <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-retry">p-retry</a> , are simply the necessary tools for organizing reliable work with third-party APIs and services.  In addition, <code>p-timeout</code> allows you to assign functions that are performed in case of unsuccessful promise.  Usually returning something meaningful, performed within a reasonable time, is better than endless fruitless waiting or getting results for an indefinite time. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">PP-cache and p-memoize modules</font> </h3><br>  The <a href="https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/p-cache">p-cache</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-memoize">p-memoize</a> modules allow you to <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-memoize">memoize the</a> results of asynchronous functions using the <a href="https://github.com/isaacs/node-lru-cache">LRU cache</a> . <br><br>  The purpose of many of the above promis utilities reminds me a lot of design of fault-tolerant <a href="https://blog.risingstack.com/designing-microservices-architecture-for-failure/">microservices</a> , where each external dependency can be handled using a common interface that supports query re-execution, timeouts, caching, request interruption, backup mechanisms, and so on. <br><br>  A simplified version of a certain functionality is usually preferable to system overload or a complete lack of results, so if you are not familiar with microservices, take a look at them and try to understand whether approaches to their design can improve your ability to work with promises. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Web scraping</font> </h2><br>  There are many excellent utilities for web scraping, some of which, like <a href="https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio">cheerio</a> , work at the level of the source HTML code, and some, such as <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer">puppeteer</a> , allow you to process pages with a full browser.  What exactly to choose depends on the goals of a specific project, since working with HTML is much faster and requires less system resources, while automating a browser without a user interface is more complicated and requires more serious preparation. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçCheerio</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio">Cheerio</a> is a fast, flexible and miniature implementation of the basic jQuery features, created specifically for the server and designed to work with HTML. <br><br>  <code>Cheerio</code> is a great tool for quick web scraping, suitable for parsing HTML pages.  This tool has a convenient syntax similar to jQuery and is designed to bypass HTML documents and perform manipulations with them.  <code>Cheerio</code> fits well with the <a href="https://github.com/request/request-promise-native">request-promise-native</a> library, designed for downloading remote HTML documents. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçPuppeteer</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer">Puppeteer</a> is a Node-API for managing Chrome browser without a user interface. <br>  Unlike <code>cheerio</code> , <code>puppeteer</code> is a wrapper for Chrome automation without a user interface, which is very useful for working with modern web applications, including single-page, JavaScript-based.  Since work is being done with the Chrome browser, <code>puppeteer</code> characterized by a high level of support for modern web standards.  This affects the ability to properly form pages and run scripts.  The Chrome browser without a user interface is a relatively new tool, but it is very likely to gradually replace older tools such as <a href="http://phantomjs.org/">PhantomJS</a> . <br><br>  As a result, it can be said that <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer">puppeteer has</a> no equal in the matter of advanced web scraping, programmatically creating screenshots of pages and automating various works with web projects.  In addition, it is worth noting that over time <code>puppeteer</code> will become increasingly popular. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Libraries for Node.js</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">OtenDotenv-safe</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://github.com/rolodato/dotenv-safe">Dotenv-safe</a> allows you to load environment variables from an <code>.env</code> file and ensures that all the necessary variables are present. <br><br>  This module extends the highly popular <a href="https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv">dotenv</a> module by supporting an indication of the expected environment variables using <code>.env.example</code> .  Like the base library, <code>dotenv-safe</code> provides fast, safe and reliable work with environment variables in the Node.js environment. <br><br>  In addition, this module is well integrated with the deployment system <a href="https://zeit.co/now">now.sh</a> with the <code>"dotenv": true</code> option set <code>"dotenv": true</code> at <a href="https://zeit.co/blog/now-json">now.json</a> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçRequest and request-promise-native</font> </h3><br>  The <a href="https://github.com/request/request">request</a> library and the <a href="https://github.com/request/request-promise-native">request-promise-native</a> library based on it, which equip it with support for ES6 promises, are clients that simplify the execution of HTTP requests. <br><br>  Execution of HTTP requests is an operation that is needed almost always and everywhere.  I use the <code>request-promise-native</code> module to perform this operation.  This happens in 95% of cases when it is required to organize waiting for the result of an HTTP request wrapped in a promise.  In the remaining 5% of cases, when you need to work with the response flow directly, I use the <code>request</code> module, which does not support promises. <br><br>  For reliability, I often wrap <code>request-promise-native</code> calls into some combination of <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-retry">p-retry</a> , <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/p-timeout">p-timeout</a> , and <a href="https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/p-cache">p-cache</a> . <br><br>  In addition, as a new alternative to <code>request</code> , it is worth noting the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/got">got</a> library, which has built-in support for promises.  I don‚Äôt use this library very often, but you might like it. <br><br>  Here is an example of loading an HTML document using <code>request-promise-native</code> . <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> request = <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">require</span></span>(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'request-promise-native'</span></span>) <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span></span> html = <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">await</span></span> request(<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">'https://github.com'</span></span>) <span class="hljs-built_in"><span class="hljs-built_in">console</span></span>.log(html)</code> </pre> <br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçConsolidate</font> </h3><br>  <a href="">Consolidate</a> is a library that provides consistent work with different template engines for Node.js. <br><br>  Consolidate is great for working with any server templates.  For example, these are templates for emails, tweets, HTML pages.  I usually use <a href="http://handlebarsjs.com/">handlebar</a> s as a template engine, but I work with it through <code>consolidate</code> .  This gives me the uniformity of the template interface, which does not depend on the system used to work with templates.  For example, I used <code>consolidate</code> in <a href="https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/create-react-library">create-react-library</a> to output base patterns. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçExeca</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/execa">Execa</a> is a very good alternative for <code>child_process</code> . <br><br>  The <code>execa</code> module <code>execa</code> very useful in cases where you need to create child processes, for example, to work with the command shell. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçFs-extra</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://github.com/jprichardson/node-fs-extra">Fs-extra</a> is an improved version of <code>fs</code> that supports additional methods and promises. <br><br>  I rarely use <code>fs</code> directly.  Try <code>fs-extra</code> and you probably won't want to use <code>fs</code> again. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Calculations</font> </h2><br>  <a href="https://d3js.org/">D3</a> (Data Driven Documents) is a popular front-end library for data visualization and animation.  In addition, it contains great math computational packages that can be used independently.  I often find myself using these packages. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçD3-random</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-random">D3-random</a> allows you to generate random numbers from various distributions. <br><br>  When <code>Math.random</code> does not give the desired result - try the library <code>d3-random</code> .  This library supports work with various distributions of random variables, including uniform, normal and exponential. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçD3-ease</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-ease">D3-ease</a> gives the developer various functions to create smooth animations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70e/b74/8b6/70eb748b665551a0f62f76b1490be865.png"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">D3-ease (image source - <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-ease">D3-ease</a> )</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçD3-interpolate</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate">D3-interpolate</a> allows you to interpol numbers, colors, strings, arrays, objects, in general - anything. <br><br>  This module provides a variety of interpolation methods to ensure a smooth transition between two arbitrary values.  These values ‚Äã‚Äãcan be numbers, colors, strings, arrays, or even objects that have other objects. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Testing</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçAva</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://github.com/avajs/ava">Ava</a> is a great tool for running JS tests. <br><br>  Given the quality of the tools created by Sindre Sorhus, it is not surprising that Ava, my favorite tool for running unit tests on Node.js platform, is their development.  The Ava project borrowed a lot of good things from <a href="https://mochajs.org/">mocha</a> , <a href="https://github.com/substack/tape">tape</a> , <a href="http://chaijs.com/">chai</a> and other testing tools.  All this is collected in a single package, the standard settings of which are suitable for real work. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the Ava tests are run, by default, in parallel, although this can be changed at the level of individual files.  This is necessary in cases where the order of running tests is important, for example, when testing systems that work with databases. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52c/661/010/52c661010ed41225ae5cca8e7859c964.gif"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Ava (image source - <a href="https://github.com/avajs/ava">ava</a> )</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçNock</font> </h3><br>  <a href="https://github.com/node-nock/nock">Nock</a> is a library for simulating the execution of HTTP requests. <br><br>  <code>Nock</code> great for isolated testing of modules that perform HTTP requests.  If your Node module performs HTTP requests and you want to prepare good tests for it - pay attention to <code>nock</code> . <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">‚ñçSinon</font> </h3><br>  <a href="http://sinonjs.org/">Sinon</a> is a system that allows you to test JS projects using spies (spy), caps (stub) and imitations (mock). <br><br>  The Sinon library contains very useful tools for writing isolated tests using the dependency injection mechanism.  Perhaps she is one of the worthy candidates for a place in the toolkit of each developer. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Results</font> </h2><br>  I hope you found in my review something useful, at least one quality tool that you didn‚Äôt know about before.  I know many experienced developers who are prone to creating their own tools to solve common problems.  This is not to say that it is bad.  However, I believe that it is useful for anyone to know about what has already been done by others, about quality tools, the use of which will allow not to engage in the constant invention of bicycles. <br><br>  The breadth of problems inherent in the NPM module library is incredible, and in my opinion, this is one of the great advantages of JavaScript in comparison with other languages.  A programmer who masterfully uses the capabilities of the npm ecosystem can seriously improve the efficiency of his work.  Perhaps it is this skill that is one of the distinguishing features of a developer who, according to <a href="http://antirez.com/news/112">myths</a> , is ten times more productive than the average programmer. <br><br>  <b>Dear readers!</b>  What tools and libraries that facilitate and accelerate the development of JS-projects, you usually use? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/351480/">https://habr.com/ru/post/351480/</a></p>
