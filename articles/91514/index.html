    <a name="habracut"></a>  <b>For reference;</b> <br><br>  <i><u>The technical-innovative special economic zone</u> in the city of Dubna is created to attract investors and provide conditions for conducting research and development, creating prototypes and producing pilot batches of high-tech products in accordance with the priority areas of scientific, technical and innovation activity, experimental development, testing and preparation personnel assigned to the city of Dubnoy as a science town of the Russian Federation by Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of December 21, 2001.</i>  <i>No. 1472. Particular attention will be paid to the development of activities in the field of information technology and nuclear physics technologies.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><u>A special, free or special economic zone</u> (abbreviated SEZ or FEZ) is a limited area with a special legal status in relation to the rest of the territory and preferential economic conditions for national and / or foreign entrepreneurs.</i>  <i>The main goal of creating such zones is to solve the strategic tasks of the development of the state as a whole or a separate territory: foreign trade, general economic, social, regional and scientific and technical tasks.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i><u>Residents</u> are companies whose offices are located in the SEZ.</i> <br><br>  Generally hurray!  The zone stands and flaunts on the banks of the Volga River and boldly looks into our bright future, and even residents already live in it.  Feel free to look at the zone curious viewer, fly news from our SEZ and written eulogy articles. <br><br>  And how, in fact, in the simple domestic plan is the life of a simple resident who chose the village of Neglupovka, that is, the Dubna SEZ, as his residence? <br><br>  For a simple resident of the city of Dubna - a zone rather a mirage, it stands by itself and stands on the left bank of the Volga, getting to it is uncomfortable.  The second bridge, which will "move" to the village Neglupovka promised, but did not build - the money ran out. <br><br>  However, where does the townsfolk?  Young professionals working in this zone are no strangers, they will get there - in extreme cases, they will ride a bike.  Dubna is a city of cyclists. <br><br>  This is all nonsense, the main thing is that to you as a resident, buckets do not fall on your head.  Why?  Happened and so! <br><br>  In the Agave company the false ceiling failed and a bucket fell out of it.  Thank God, not a single resident arrived.  By the way, the gossipers put the bucket on the false ceiling - as the roof flowed.  But on, then they are also gostrabaytery to ‚Äúrepair‚Äù the leaking roofs with buckets <br><br>  In general, the guest workers in the zone are a separate story.  They not only practically built this zone with their working hands, they also take a lively part in her life.  So they live in a zone in trailers, wash themselves on the Volga River with a beautiful view of the right bank of Dubna, and for ‚Äúprevention‚Äù they put paper in the toilets and live well and life is good! <br>  By the way about the roofs, we have not finished ...  Roofs in Neglupovka village are a separate category.  After all, in fact, not all residents are only great, many have cars, but you cannot drive to the building by car!  Guess why?  That's right - at the underground parking falls roof. <br>  By the way, it is reliably known that the Tajiks are tyryat paper from the toilets - <b>but who stole the normal wall from the office of one technical director?</b> <br><br>  The fact that he has a wall of hyposboard, he learned just in the 30-degree frost.  Yes, exactly the wall between the street and the technical director.  And she is from hypocardon.  But in principle, it is possible to get used to the 30-degree frost - all the same, everyone goes outside to smoke, as smoking in Neglupovka is not provided.  But in the bar beer is poured - for a parable is close to the people - a programmer without beer is not a programmer. <br><br>  As we have already mentioned above, the village of Neglupovka stands on the picturesque bank of the Volga River far from residential areas, and the landscape, besides the Tajiks, washing in the river is complemented by mountains of broken glass and any other construction trash. <br><br>  Neglupovke security is strict, no documents will be let through - only with toilet paper unless they are released.  Somehow, the security service drove one analyst from work at 12 o'clock at night (his customers are Americans, he was at the rally with them) because they were told that no one should be in the building after 8 pm - then of course the security chief apologized. <br><br>  Somehow one resident asked quite a simple question, was it back in 2007. <br><br>  <b>Question:</b> This year we have already encountered the problem of traffic jams - in a tunnel, on a dam.  And when another third of the city will be added, what shall we do? <br><br>  <b>Answer:</b> The SEZ project, on the one hand, of course, increases the workload, but, on the other hand, it makes it possible to solve pressing problems that have not been solved by other means so far. <br>  The expansion of the bridge of the dam and the reconstruction of the tunnel are planned.  Funds for the reconstruction of these two objects are provided for in the federal budget.  Work will begin as early as next year, and is planned to be completed fairly quickly. <br><br>  In addition, within the framework of the project of creating a special economic zone, a whole number of roads are also being reconstructed.  Expanded and reconstructed new road.  It will be extended past the repair base with departure to Savelovo.  Roads will be built in continuation of Popov and Vokzalnaya streets to the New Industrial Zone (up to the New Road).  The reconstruction of roads along the streets of Zhukovsky and Makarenko, from the dam to Khlebozavodskaya street, has begun.  A continuation of the road along Volodarsky Street to the Southern Ditch and further to the new Sports Palace will be built.  A number of roads will also be built in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Russian Programming Center. <br><br>  Designed a new bridge across the Volga.  This is a big project, and there is no information when it is fully implemented.  But according to those plans, according to the opportunities that we have, deterioration in the transport communication in connection with the creation of a special economic zone is not expected. <br><br>  <b>Outside 2010 - the situation with traffic jams has not changed.</b> <br><br>  What is this post about, you think?  About the bucket, about the gypsum wall from the street or about the mythical bridge over the Volga?  In principle, of course, small problems are not visible and "big" people should not solve them. <br><br>  Residents have a beer at the bar, but there are no payment terminals, and the city still needs to be ‚Äúfinished‚Äù.  Residents have a status, but there is no normal parking.  They fall on the head of the bucket and their walls are made of hypocardboard - but the Tajiks with their toilet paper are very funny people.  These are all trifles - but who would know how important the individual screws are in the good functioning of one large mechanism. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91514/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91514/</a></p>
