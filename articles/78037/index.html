  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Buying books at www.betterworldbooks.com</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Sadly, but if you are a technical specialist, or you want to become one, and you need relevant books on the desired subject, then you have to order this literature in a foreign language abroad. <br>  It happened to me. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  On the third year of the institute, I decided to get a CCNA, but since  there is no money for courses, and the necessary literature in Russian has not been republished for a long time, it was decided to order the book <b>CCNA Official Exam Certification Library (Exam 640-802), Third Edition (Containing ICND1 and ICND2 Second Edition Exam Certification Guides)</b> . <br>  When it was determined with the book, it was the turn to determine the store and the method of payment. <br>  He coped with the second task quickly - a Visa Classic card was made, which is accepted almost everywhere, but the store didn‚Äôt work as smoothly as I had planned. <br>  It was originally intended to make a purchase on <a href="http://www.amazon.com/">www.amazon.com</a> , because  the price was attracted by the price and it was just that the hands ‚Äúto buy something on Amazon‚Äù simply scratched, but when you made it out, it turned out that because of Russian customs, only ‚ÄúPriority Courier Shipping‚Äù is available for delivery from the American Amazon, the price of which approaches the price of the book, and the price delivery to other Amazons did not please. <br>  Having already come to terms with the idea that nothing will work out with the book and you will at least have to wait for the electronic version to be uploaded to the Internet, I accidentally stumbled upon a story about the wonderful store <a href="http://www.betterworldbooks.com/">Better World Books</a> . <br>  The required book cost more expensive there ($ 41.48 place $ 37.79), but there was a delivery by regular mail, which cost about $ 4 a place $ 30 on Amazon.  If to transfer to rubles, the order, including delivery, cost me 1350r.  The order was made a month and a half ago, the money was immediately deducted from the card, no mobile bank and no confirmation code was required.  A week ago, the book successfully arrived at the post office of my city, where I successfully received it. <br>  The main feature of this store is that second-hand books are also sold there, at a much lower price, but I have not used this opportunity yet. <br>  That's the end of my first post on Habr√© =) Good shopping and good books! </div>
