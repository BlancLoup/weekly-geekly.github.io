This is a surprise.  Virtually real love affairs agitated the minds of Internet inhabitants long before the appearance of the first prototypes of VR devices.  But now users have an official reason to wait for the realization of the fantasy of virtual promiscuity. <br><br>  The other day, Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey <a href="http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/oculus-rift-will-be-open-to-virtual-reality-porn">declared</a> : ‚ÄúOur glasses are an open platform.  We do not control what software can be installed on them. ‚Äù  Thus, the company promises not to hinder the distribution of adult content for their devices.  But she is not going to contribute to it.  The fact is that Oculus VR is officially owned by Facebook, and all applications for their virtual reality slam can be downloaded only from the Oculus Store, where strict censorship takes place.  That is, it will be possible to create and sell applications of the category 18+, but not through official sources. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Such cunning creators of Oculus can be understood: on the one hand, a large company does not need the reputation of a virtual brothel, but on the other - you don‚Äôt want to lose such, obviously, a considerable part of customers as consumers of 18+ content.  In the meantime, Palmer is cunning, the giants of the industry are already stamping out the appropriate applications and videos for VR devices.  In fairness it should be noted that other developers of virtual reality devices refrained from commenting on the topic, which means that Oculus VR is currently the only ones who have promised to take the user to the world of virtual adultery, even if in a roundabout way.  In the meantime, the helmet itself did not come out, it remains only to save money and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhLqVxC6JWIM">watch how</a> others <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DhLqVxC6JWIM">look</a> .

    <br><h3>  Google has added support for pre-registrations. </h3><br>  The Play Store <a href="http://www.mobyaffiliates.com/blog/google-adds-app-pre-registration-feature-to-google-play-store/">has a</a> new feature - pre-registration.  This will allow developers to announce their project in the store before its release, filling out a full page and laying out icons, screenshots and description.  All the difference from the normal page of the application will be that instead of the "Download" button, users will see "Register". <br><br>  The first pre-registration support game was Terminator Genisys: Revolution from Glu Mobile.  In fact, after clicking on the registration, the user is given a dialog box in which the preliminary registration is reported.  It is expected that after the release of the application, the Play Store itself will inform the user that the application can be downloaded, or, possibly, automatically install it, as is usually the case with updates. <br><br><h3>  Mobile report "They say the creators" </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce6/d40/cd4/ce6d40cd43774df1b6aac34f7ab92cbd.jpg"><br><br>  Mobile Outsourcing Trends <br>  Annual report ‚ÄúThe creators say: Mobile outsourcing trends‚Äù was published.  It is based on data from a survey of mobile developers and is presented in the form of infographics. <br>  Here are some interesting facts you can learn from it: <br><ul><li>  65% of agencies receive more than half of their income from mobile. </li><li>  50% of mobile development companies depend on ‚Äúguys with ideas‚Äù and start-ups.  If funding for such startups stops, then the future of companies will become uncertain. </li><li>  10% of companies believe that HTML5 applications will dominate the market in the next 3 years. </li><li>  40% of mobile developers say that only 25% of their customers will become a viable business. </li><li>  60% of companies say that only 25% of their customers think about monetization. </li><li>  28% of companies believe that the salaries of developers are too high, and 34% - that they are too small. </li><li>  In Eastern Europe, the average hour of iOS and Android development costs $ 35, and prices will rise. </li><li>  Most popular tools - MVC frameworks, backend, helpdesk </li></ul><br>  You can see the full version at the <a href="https://contractiq.com/mobile-app-development-report-2015">link.</a> <br><br><br><h3>  Glispa: good tutorial will not provide good sales </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6fe/31c/507/6fe31c507b3f4e16b064bb33e8a0fedd.jpg"><br><br>  The guys from glispa <a href="http://www.glispa.com/blog/glispa-data-flash-game-developers-focus-wrong-engagement-monetization-opps.html">conducted a study of</a> how tutorial affects the monetization of games.  According to their data, it turns out that out of 65% of players who passed the tutorial, only 2% made purchases.  Based on the data obtained, researchers say that a tutorial is not a grail and it does not guarantee successful monetization and that for success it is necessary to ‚Äúdig‚Äù into alternative sides. <br><br>  It is difficult to argue with such a conclusion, let us try to abstract from what was heard and figure it out on the fingers.  Suppose everyone who did not complete the tutorial did not make payments at all, then it turns out that the conversion to paying will be 1.3%.  That in itself is not the worst results and a hint that the tutorial is a useful thing. <br><br>  In general, the statement is, of course, true, I would even say the captain.  Tutorial is a rather necessary, but insufficient element of the game.  And, in my opinion, this is an obvious fact. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/258801/">https://habr.com/ru/post/258801/</a></p>
