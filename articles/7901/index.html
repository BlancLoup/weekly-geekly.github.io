  <section class="page js-page"><h1>culture loc</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I was tinkering here on the Internet, in order to find myself a windows manager for X. xfce4, of course, a cool thing, but there are a couple of features that irritate me personally.  No, well, it would be possible, as a truehacker, to remove a couple of lines from the sources and add lines 20, but something bad habit works: first go search among the ready-made solutions, then do it yourself.  It is absolutely non-creative. <br><br>  You come to your friends and say: but, I want such a thing X, and they, so this cool thing X is made by those, so and so, go download, customize.  Sadly, because by doing so they kill the opportunity to develop.  Who knows what we would come to if we ourselves tried to write such a piece of X. And an opinion prevails around: inventing bicycles is a great evil and nepotrebschina.  But here's what I propose to pay attention to anti-belopepedists <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Take for example the company Intel.  What is Intel doing?  Invents processors.  Does the processors and does.  She has such a goal: to make the best processors in the world.  But processors are still made by a bunch of firms from AMD, IBM, Sony, Toshiba, Samsung.  And what is coming out?  Intel invents bicycles on an industrial scale.  Only these bikes are called processors.  A modern domestic programmer would ask them: why do they do it?  After all, you can take a ready-made processor and do nothing.  But in general, manufacturers of high-tech material goods are occupied by the fact that they constantly tighten the nuts on their bicycles.  Well, someone invented there an mp3-player, Apple tightened the screws and made an iPod.  And the iPod turned out to be cooler than the original player, but it was just a cosmetic change of substance.

      By the way, in the production of software for very big money the same atmosphere reigns.  All make similar software products, differing only in details.  But this does not prevent the parts from endowing these products with original and interesting properties, which then develop into something big and interesting.  Well, take, for example, Eclipse, which at first was just another VisualAge with plug-ins. <br><br>  But when it comes to open source or internet (web 2.0), where any programs or systems are publicly available, everything changes dramatically.  Well, I do not like cpufreqd.  I come out to the forum, I say: your cpufreqd is fat, hell is engaged, knows, except for convenient frequency control, let's write a new lightweight alternative.  And there is a lot of willing?  Zero.  All the answers are similar: the fool himself, and your hands grow from the anus, and in cpufreqd what you want is done with the help of this configuration file with a size of 100 lines.  But I want this too.  And this is done with the help of this file in 200 lines.  But I want both this and that at the same time!  No, well, what are you?  You just want the wrong.  Go throw your laptop in the trash and buy yourself one that has passed tests for compatibility with linux.  As if this will change the logic of cpufreqd or the processor in this laptop will be different. <br><br>  That is, people just do not want to try new things.  Strange.  With web services the same.  Well, I want to upload the code to the web with the ability to track cross-references and all sorts of other things.  I am told, so there is already.  Go there, post it there.  And this is even without trying to think about how to do it, how to improve it, how to make it more efficient and more convenient.  That's what kills.  Finished bikes are considered the best possible a priori.  But, the main thesis: not inventing bicycles, people deprive themselves of the opportunity to think of something really interesting, original and opening the way to new inventions.  Let them even, they will have a clumsy bike. <br><br>  The fear that we will do something new is completely unjustified.  We do not live in the 19th century, when intellectual work employs 10 people, whom everyone knows.  I work in programming millions, and most of them are quite cunning representatives of the species homo sapiens.  Of course, much has already been invented in this world.  But even in the katana, you can make strokes that will make it more deadly, and this is also a decent work. <br><br>  Here it is.  But people are even more afraid of a completely new instrument.  Attempts to break through what we need is a new compiler derived from SI, but with some additional features (well, ok, not additional, but significantly changing the semantics of the language) that will make life better, immediately stumble upon a bitter one: AND WHY !?  Why, when there is already a bike C?  Again, you begin to explain: it will be easier to do this and that, as well as the opportunity to do so.  What do you get off the punching: if you distort it, then you can do it in C, and no one else needs it, because people do not think so.  As if everyone in this life loves to be perverted and loves to think through the stump of a deck, and not in convenient terms. <br><br>  In short, funding to knock out is such a hemorrhoids.  But how else to develop?  Well, I can not think of a completely new thing.  Absolutely completely new, because nothing like this can be invented.  Even a wiki - why not a mutated forum?  Is L4 a perverted vision of Mach? <br><br>  Vobshchem the fear can be clear.  The imagination of people is not enough to present new opportunities.  And perhaps this is very correct.  Healthy skepticism is good.  But the problem is that all the money and resources in the hands of skeptics.  Our country is not a US venture.  And how to break through with new ideas, how to do the same thing but twice as good?  How to prove that it will be twice as good, except by not making this bike with inertial brakes? <br><br>  Not.  I understand the case - the only way to prove the viability of the project.  But, I also want to eat while working.  Hyh  It turns out that creativity in our country, again, can only be a hobby.  While not famous for his work.  But is it possible to create something really serious in a reasonable time?  Who knows. <br><br>  Okay.  I left in strontium.  So here.  I was looking for WM for X. And this is a very pleasant from my point of view riveting software.  Because nobody shouts here that: everything that you want is already done in GNOME, you just need to write this one config file with a length of several meters (geometric).  It all happened so that the creation of a new wm is kosher.  And I came across such a thing - wmii.  She writes a couple of fanatics Plan9. <br><br>  Plan9, by the way, is a separate song.  Despite the dominance of classic Unixes, Robert and his team still struck the idea that it would be nice to come up with another one to tighten some nuts.  And it turned out quite well.  So, do not be afraid of the invention of bicycles.  Want to write a new wiki - write, and do not listen to those who will say that everything has already been done, because no one knows what you want to do there until you do it.  Until your moving inner world is expressed in the same moving program, and not in a static picture that you are trying to describe in words, an application for funding, an article or a collection of algorithms.  Life is not a set of formulas, but life itself in the flesh.  I do not understand why so many do not understand this. <br><br>  So what am I talking about?  About wmii.  So ... Fans of Plan9 are fan of this kind of thing called loc - lines of code.  Less is better.  On suckless.org, which is a homepage for wmii, they are pointedly proud that their functional diri is only 200 lines of rc code, and wmii itself takes only 10,000 loc.  This is what makes Plan9 even nicer. I also become a fanatic:)?  \ In an age when 100 kilobytes of php-code in the archive are considered a small decision, the guys do a lot of things in 200 lines.  Of course, this contributes to the convenient structure of services in the Plan.  But simply striving to write everything as short as possible and as clear as possible for others is good.  By the way, the sources of the Plan9 kernel are much easier to read than the sources of the same linux.  I do not know why.  Maybe for the same reason that the kernel was written for the same purpose of maximizing the ratio of the functionality / loc?  And not just to be and work, as is done in Linux according to my feelings. <br><br>  Hyh  But I wanted to write a short post about the fact that loc is good.  And it turned out that about the sore subject - bicycles.  But, heroically concentrating, I still wrote about loc, and now everyone will know that this is very good :) If you can write a wiki of 11 lines in python (WyPy), then python is quite possibly very good.  Yet again.  This WyPy is a pure bike, because it was a wiki before it, but it is a special wiki that highlights the minimal known set of constructs needed to write web applications, and, more importantly, it teaches immature minds about the strength and power of lambda.  In short, for me, so the invention of bicycles is the most worthy of the lessons. <br><br>  And everyone who requires a fundamental novelty, you need to poke into his work and say: oh, my friend, did you really use natural numbers in your article of 1812?  How could you use such an ancient tool in constructing your theory?  Or so.  Thoughtfully pinching yourself by the beard, roll your eyes and say: how, how.  Say that you have come up with a new representation for finite fields, which is written in the form of a multiplication table?  But if we take the intersection of three linear spaces, four Lie groups and one sigma of algebra, then we get the same thing - and nothing new is absolutely necessary here. <br><br>  Hyh  Damn, I suffered again, okay, I'm going to suffer over the words \ hates writing articles \ <br><br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7901/</a></p>
