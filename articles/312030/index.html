Hundreds of millions of devices and the high demand for support for Ethernet-based systems indicate that the invention 43 years ago was firmly established and will not disappear anywhere in the near future. <br><br>  In the course of the development of computer technology, Ethernet was constantly ‚Äúreinvented‚Äù, added new features and made generally accepted network technology.  In this article we will discuss the topic of the evolution of Ethernet - from invention to becoming an international standard and the basis of a huge number of networks. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/312030/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06d/8d4/077/06d8d40775394cc08139a672ebaaf64c.jpg"></a> <br>  <i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/kalasmannen/">Magnus</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">CC</a></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Since the invention of the telegraph, a huge period of time has passed by the modern standards of the world of technology, but the rapid development of network information transmission began only 40 years ago.  Digital communications seems to us a new idea, but the principles remain the same.

      From Samuel Morse and Emil Bodo to Donald Murray, teletypes and ASCII competition with EBCDIC - the development is based on the development of certain standards and their constant revision. <br><br><h3>  Hi Bob! </h3><br>  The concept, which is the foundation of Ethernet, was proposed by Robert Metcalf of Xerox PARC Research Center.  His idea, in turn, was based on an earlier network technology - ALOHAnet, the author of which was Norman Abramson. <br><br>  The Aloha protocol was fairly simple: one of the stations sent a message at any time and was awaiting confirmation of receipt.  If the confirmation did not come, it was assumed that the second party transmitted its signal at the same moment, which means that neither of the parties accepted the message. <br><br>  At this point, both transmitting stations should have determined the time to delay, and then re-send their messages with a higher probability of successful transmission.  However, with the growth of network traffic, Aloha ceased to handle the load. <br><br>  Bob adapted this technology to link computers and printers that were in the Xerox PARC center.  He called the first experimental network, Alto Aloha Network, but in 1973 changed its name to Ethernet to emphasize the significant efficiency gains compared to Aloha. <br><br>  This was followed by the principle of listen before talk, support for access for several stations and the CSMA / CD protocol.  The corporation missed the opportunity to turn all these inventions into very profitable products, and along with the departure of Bob from the company in 1979, Ethernet became open for use.  The first Ethernet Blue Book specification was released in 1980 ‚Äî it was a 10-megabit system that used coaxial cable at 2.5 meter intervals. <br><br><h3>  Evolution </h3><br>  In 1983, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) released the official Ethernet standard - IEEE 802.3, and in 1985 its second version appeared - IEEE 802.3a, according to which the maximum effective length of coaxial cable was 185 meters.  IEEE 802.3 was adopted by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as the official international standard for Ethernet systems. <br><br>  In 1991, the Alliance of Electronic Industries (EIA), together with the Telecommunications Industry Association, published the first standard for EIA / TIA 568 connections, based on an unshielded twisted pair category 3 (UTP), and the TSB-36 standard, which defined the higher categories of UTP cables - category 4 and 5 (Cat 4, Cat 5).  So in the USA there was a structured cable system. <br><br>  In 1995, the IEEE 802.3u standard was adopted with a speed of 100 Mbit / s, and in 1997, the IEEE 802.3z Gigabit Ethernet standard was adopted with a speed of 1000 Mbit / s for transmission over optical fiber and two years later for transmission over twisted pair. <br><br>  Then began the active development of 10 Gbit / s Ethernet networks.  The 10 Gigabit Ethernet standard, approved in June 2002, is already being used in corporate networks.  It has the name IEEE 802.3ae and practically does not differ from the original Ethernet version - the same header format, preamble, frame sizes are preserved. <br><br>  Four years after that, the 802.3ba group noted that the bandwidth requirements for computing tasks and core applications are growing at different speeds.  This determined the need for two appropriate standards for the next generation Ethernet - 40 Gigabit Ethernet (or 40GbE) and 100 Gigabit Ethernet (or 100GbE), which were adopted between November 2007 and June 2010. <br><br>  The IEEE 802.3ba standard sets the data transfer rate to 40 and 100 Gb / s when sharing multiple communication lines at 10 or 25 Gb / s.  In 2011, began the widespread introduction of 100-gigabit Ethernet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22c/baf/d05/22cbafd0568a483e946aebddc7b0f13c.jpg"><br>  <i>/ photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/artbystevejohnson/">Steve Johnson</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i> <br><br><h3>  Future </h3><br>  Ethernet continues to evolve rapidly today.  Many engineers around the world work tirelessly on the protocol and create new versions of the system for various applications. <br><br>  The IEEE 802.3by standard for 25 gigabits was adopted in June 2016.  Will be used in data centers.  High speeds are important for cloud technologies - connecting 10 gigabits to one server is no longer enough.  Work is also continuing on an Ethernet standard of 50 gigabits, which should be the next step in increasing connection speed for data centers. <br><br>  2.5 gigabit and 5 gigabit ethernet should help companies set up high-speed indoor wireless communication.  The main focus of these standards will be to increase the capacity of wired connections to the level of wireless access points in the corporate infrastructure. <br><br>  Another IEEE group is working on a 400-gigabit Ethernet standard.  Compounds of this speed are likely to be assembled from 50 gigabit or 100 gigabit lanes.  Ultra-fast standards over 400 gigabit should not be expected before 2020. <br><br><h3>  Instead of conclusion </h3><br>  Today it is difficult to imagine that once it was necessary to send discs by mail or courier delivery and it was impossible to immediately look at the offers of stores without paper catalogs.  Modern business could not exist without computer networks.  All this was made possible thanks to the Ethernet technology, which will remain with us for a long time and continue to develop and achieve new speeds. <br><br>  <i>Additional reading: <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/310632/">IaaS-digest - 25 materials on the transformation of technology and business</a></b> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/312030/">https://habr.com/ru/post/312030/</a></p>
