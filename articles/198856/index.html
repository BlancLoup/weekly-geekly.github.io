  <section class="page js-page"><h1>FailConf-2013: conference on errors in IT business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On November 16, for the third time in Yekaterinburg, an unusual FailConf conference will take place: instead of successful cases and demonstrations of achievements, speakers will talk about failures and mistakes made in the IT business.  Such events are held in different countries of the world, but only we are holding such a conference in Russia so far. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/165/5ef/beb/1655efbeb887239fc2c037cd05decb4e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Over the past two conferences, more than twenty businessmen told us about their failures, including Leonid Volkov, Evgeny Ostrovsky, Aleksey Kulakov, Sergey Gershtein, Leonid Gluzman, Anton Khalikov, Ilya Bublik.  We already know about the failes from the history of the E1 portal, about how MediaSite ‚Äúmade millions on optimism‚Äù, about how the Blizko.ru commercial director chose the wrong sales and positioning strategy of the portal and about many other errors that caused companies to lose money and customers.

      This year, you will have the opportunity to hear a new batch of reports about ‚Äúmiscalculations‚Äù, having learned that, a novice IT businessman will be able to find the optimal way, faced with a similar situation.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe conference is to show that everyone is mistaken.  Everyone has failures in the beginning, and the whole question is only what conclusions can be drawn from their failures.  One of the most important values ‚Äã‚Äãof the conference is that people come out inspired from here, ready to start a new project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de3/ba6/754/de3ba6754c47757e6bcf5ac53303b2cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Reviews from past conferences</b> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Ilya Leontyev, Head of IT Projects of Bank24.ru: <br>  <i>- I saw the success stories without embellishment.</i>  <i>Each speaker said that it was hard, he stumbled, but he got up and continued to do what he believes, day and night, without time to sleep, without money for the most necessary.</i>  <i>And, despite the mistakes, he achieved his goal.</i>  <i>My main conclusion: no one is immune from mistakes, no, not even the smartest books will save you from them - simply because unless you try it yourself, you will not understand anything.</i>  <i>But there is a chance that if you got into a problem situation, like that guy with Failconf, and realized this, then you will be able to react and cope faster.</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://rodion-popkov.livejournal.com/97807.html">rodion-popkov.livejournal.com/97807.html</a> : <br>  <i>To say that FailConf was a success is to say nothing.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>There were no reports that were not interesting in their own way.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The reports of Leonid Volkov, Ilya Rebrov, Ilya Bublik, Alexey Kulakov and Evgeny Ostrovsky were especially memorable.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And I am once again lucky.</i>  <i>For the second conference in a row, I win something by questionnaires.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/776/a82/25a/776a8225aae8189e2681c072abf6ee28.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>What will happen this time:</b> <br>  ‚óè more than 10 speakers; <br>  ‚óè 200 participants; <br>  ‚óè city center, excellent chairs and nice interior; <br>  ‚óè prize draws from our sponsors; <br>  ‚óè the opportunity to contact the speakers directly, chat with colleagues, meet new people; <br>  ‚óè the opportunity to speak for yourself; <br>  ‚óè great atmosphere from IT-People; <br>  ‚óè pears. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb2/6f7/7f9/fb26f77f99f93e2a6cb8e7fa17c9e69f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We are waiting for all those who are interested in IT business, who want to talk to live with famous businessmen of the Urals and Moscow, who know how to learn from the mistakes of others.  FailConf is an opportunity to see people who really burn with their business, love it and are ready to warn against mistakes that they themselves have made. <br><br>  We also invite speakers at FailConf-2013 who are willing to talk about their mistakes, share experiences and conclusions.  We are waiting for IT businessmen and young startups who are not afraid to talk about their Fails.  Want to speak - write to info@it-people.ru <br><br>  Speech format: 20 minutes for a story + 10 minutes for questions. <br><br>  Errors must be a management plan (in choosing a niche, positioning, searching for a partner).
