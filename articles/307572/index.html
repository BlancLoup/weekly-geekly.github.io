These bold doubts in her words: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI also have moments of doubt and weakness.  The moments when I do something, before I think it over.  The moments when I choose the easiest way.  Moments when I gossip and envy.  Moments of deep insecurity " <br></blockquote>  Not all of us are endowed with her talents, but why not try to overcome the thoughts of ‚Äúwhat if ...‚Äù with self-expression? <br><br>  Derived from the lines of the song ‚ÄúExpress Yourself‚Äù by Madonna, the article contains 33 bright ways to live a full life, meeting approval, falling, self-seeking and life values, spirituality, imperfection, honesty, creativity and purposefulness on the way.

    <h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. Do what the inner voice says</font> </h2><br>  Before you do something to get on your nerves, write about what you like.  Focus on what you love to do and invest your soul in this business! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Make panic your friend</font> </h2><br>  The more you pretend that you do not panic, the more you see that panic still overcame you.  Jeff Goldblum in the Jurassic Park film says: <blockquote>  ‚Äú... life will not be measured.  It easily gets out of control, opens up new horizons for you and destroys obstacles, sometimes it is painful and dangerous ... life, uh ... finds a way out ... " </blockquote><br>  Your panic is alive and gives you live, so do not try to suppress it and use it as a trigger. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Reduce alcohol intake and stay cool.</font> </h2><br>  Do not be cool.  Feel the fullness of life and limit the use of alcohol, sugar and caffeine, which kindle anxiety and mask feelings. <br><br>  You should listen to your inner voice and speak frankly about your own feelings.  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/obzor-seminara-toni-robbinsa-osvobodite-vnutrennyuyu-silu-den-3-idite-naprolom-k-svoey-novoy-zhizni-/">Overcome fears</a> by taking responsibility for your words and actions. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Get rid of trash and breathe</font> </h2><br>  Get rid of the rubbish that inspires fear and apathy on you and prioritize yourself. <br>  Develop a life-affirming habit of breathing and living measuredly.  Inhale at the count of 4, hold out until 7-11 seconds, exhale again. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Stop being afraid of being misunderstood</font> </h2><br>  Do not expect people to read your mind.  Pick the right words and go to meet people, tell them about what you feel, think and what you want. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. Swing the boat and do not try to "fit" in society</font> </h2><br>  Do not try to fulfill other people's whims or adapt to society.  Strengthen your integrity and act intuitively.  Your life is a permanent choice.  Do it and accept all the consequences of this choice. <br><br>  Count on the best and do not be afraid to try. <br>  In predictable circumstances it is much safer, but what does it cost you?  Don't settle for less or not the best.  Do not be afraid when everything collapses.  Always try new things and let them crumble, fail until you experience success. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. Do not judge</font> </h2><br>  Stop putting labels on people.  Are you not tired of condemning yourself and other people?  When you stop doing this, you will notice that the condemnation used to take a lot of space in your life. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">8. Fail failures often, but quickly rise.</font> </h2><br>  Quickly pull yourself together, because repeated failures give <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-udivitelnykh-urokov-liderstva-i-komandnoy-raboty-pozaimstvovannye-iz-dzhaza/">invaluable lessons</a> and open up new opportunities for you. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">9. Compare real and made-up reasons for anxiety.</font> </h2><br>  Analyze reality by comparing immediate and perceived causes of anxiety.  Instead of inventing unnecessary reasons for alarm, use your imagination with benefit and think of something. <br><br>  Look in people for good qualities and start a cycle of help, offering and asking for help from others.  Allow others to open up to you, in turn, do not be afraid to open up to them.  Speak sincerely, to always see only the good in yourself and other people. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">10. Absorb emotions like a sponge.</font> </h2><br>  Have you tried to muffle emotions after being told that you are too sensitive?  Tune in and direct this trait in the right direction.  After all, opposing emotions are apathy, indifference and callousness.  Therefore, experience emotions and share them with others! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">11. Leave your island and ask for help.</font> </h2><br>  Allocate at least an hour a week to communicate with others.  Call a friend, schedule an appointment or volunteer event.  Make new acquaintances. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">12. Give a helping hand</font> </h2><br>  Thinking ‚Äúwhat if ...‚Äù is very selfish, especially when you think ‚ÄúWhat will I tell them when they stop talking?‚Äù <br><br>  Do not load your thoughts and help others, just smile and listen to them. <br><br>  Forget the superficiality;  Do not overestimate or underestimate your advantages and problems.  You don't need wealth, surface illusions, or distracting things.  Feel focused, carefree and sincere. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">13. Get solid ground under your feet, start small and further develop.</font> </h2><br>  During the school years, many people gave up because of unrealistic hopes and failures.  Thanks to the grand ideas appear goals! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">14. Think narrowly</font> </h2><br>  Your brain is too open for new features!  It is beautiful and incredible.  But focus on a specific case to understand all its aspects. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">15. Why are you so serious?</font> </h2><br>  Stop taking yourself so seriously, learn to laugh and move on.  Try. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">16. Release the reins and get wild!</font> </h2><br>  Anxiety stands next to the control, so cross the threshold of your comfort zone.  Spend time in nature, where you can find perfection outside the monitor. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">17. Learn to thank</font> </h2><br>  Attract success.  Be concentrated and use intuition to attract good luck at the right moment. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">18. Think and be calm.</font> </h2><br>  Keep your <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/uroki-lyubvi-i-garmonii-ot-bryusa-springstina/">inner peace in harmony</a> and clear your thoughts by focusing on your breathing.  Do this for 10 minutes a day. <br><br>  Find perfection in the imperfect and understand that you deserve a happy and interesting life.  <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/8-yavnyx-priznakov-uspeshnoj-zhizni-ne-imeyushhix-nikakogo-otnosheniya-k-dengam-ili-slave/">True happiness</a> is not an act, but a state of mind.  Feel this state and live to the fullest.  You deserve it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">19. Be like our smaller brothers</font> </h2><br>  Animals know a lot about life, so try to be closer to nature.  Your pet will never judge and will not be bothered by trifles. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">20. Practice much to achieve success.</font> </h2><br>  Imagine that you have become successful by overcoming all the thoughts of "what if ...".  Success is the result of practice, muscle memory.  Read Amy Cuddy's Presence book and practice positive body language, and then you will have corresponding thoughts. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">21. Right to the end!</font> </h2><br>  Do not allow anything, especially perfectionism, to block the road to the finish line. <br>  Constant work and perseverance strengthen your success and self-confidence. <br><br>  Always go with your head up.  Rationally consider what the thoughts of ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù lead to.  Watch when thoughts become irrational and change their direction. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">22. Destroy the walls</font> </h2><br>  Feel and express your emotions, even anger.  Honesty will destroy the wall that separates you from others, and lead to a goal and happiness. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">23. No more <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/5-sposobov-obshheniya-s-pytayushhimisya-podavit-vas-lyudmi-v-perelomnye-momenty-zhizni/">manipulations.</a></font> </h2><br>  No more sighs, criticism, complaints and whining.  Do not pretend that all is well.  Be realistic and act confidently. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">24. Be yourself and engage in self-development.</font> </h2><br>  Live as you see fit and continue to engage in self-development.  For example, yoga on Thursdays is a good way to get to know yourself. <br><br>  Find your moral and social norms, harmony and discipline, starting with the introduction of positive and structured in your day. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">25. Build relationships on empathy and friendship.</font> </h2><br>  Instead of using the destructive ‚ÄúI can't‚Äù in your speech, speak positively and from the heart.  Learn the art of caring without becoming a characterless person. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">26. Balance</font> </h2><br>  Prioritize the balance of a calm, healthy, measured life.  Do not underestimate the importance of a good night's sleep, organized life in the house, a healthy daily routine, breaks and friends who are above ‚Äúmore important work‚Äù. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">27. Pull a pair of assholes!</font> </h2><br>  Do not forget about the constant physical exercises.  Find yourself in one of the disciplines and connect with your breathing, accomplishments, responsibilities and go to the end. <br><br>  Directing your anxious thoughts in the right direction turns them into expressiveness, allowing you to make a decision that will open new doors and improve your life. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">28. Art and music</font> </h2><br>  Find yourself a creative person through drawing, sculpture or music. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">29. Rearrange / decorate</font> </h2><br>  It can be such simple actions as rearrangement in the room or putting things in the closet.  This is a positive action.  Also a good result will bring the usual cleaning. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">30. Speak!</font> </h2><br>  Enroll in a theater group or conversational class.  Practice on your own, on camera, online or in front of a group. <br><br>  Remember everything, do not deny the past, but focus fully on the present.  Do as much as possible in the present and do not regret anything. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">31. Find the cause</font> </h2><br>  It is not the desire to receive rewards that will lead you to the goal, but the search for a reason to love what you are doing. <br>  Madonna also advises societies and schools: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúWhen you feel depressed or trapped, stop thinking about yourself and do something good for another.  This is an excellent medicine for sadness, anxiety and uncertainty "..." </blockquote><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">32. Focus on your goal</font> </h2><br>  Instead of worrying about what others think of you, think about what you want to overcome and learn something new.  Ask yourself about your goals several times and find the true reasons for your actions. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">33. Make a positive to-do list set up for action!</font> </h2><br>  Decide what you can do today without regretting what you have done.  Every day, take at least one step towards your goal. <br><br>  At your next gig or event, unleash your anxiety.  Grow, flourish, shine from harmony and passion to turn self-doubt into a way of self-expression. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the work on yourself - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-neobychnykh-privychek-vysokoproduktivnykh-lyudey/">5 unusual habits of highly productive people</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/307572/">https://habr.com/ru/post/307572/</a></p>
