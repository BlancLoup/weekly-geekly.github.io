  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Letters to the Editor"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the oldest forms of communication of the publishing team with readers are ‚Äúletters to the editor‚Äù.  This type of communication implies that the editors publish the most interesting and pressing of the readers' appeals, accompanied by their answers or comments.  Of course, due to the specifics of our projects, the term ‚Äúedition‚Äù is applied to us very conditionally.  But this concept of interaction with the audience always seemed to us quite interesting, and today we decided to try it out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hr/5a/5c/hr5a5c4edlph0micuh--znfrcpy.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Appeals to the wrong address </h2><br>  Surprisingly, the answer is <i>‚ÄúHello!</i>  <i>Apparently, you were mistaken by the addressee ‚Äù</i> is one of the most requested by our support service specialists.  This is due to the fact that a large proportion of the complaints we receive, in fact, is not addressed to us at all: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI acquired a system unit in m-video Perm with the installation of Thinkfree Office Neo (Home) ESD PROMO.  When you start your computer at home, Office requires activation.  I downloaded the distribution kit, but with the introduction of the key given to me, the office is not activated.  What to do?" </blockquote><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI downloaded the zvooq application on ios, I used it for a while, but at one point the music just stopped playing through the application.  I had to remove it, but over the course of 2 months my money was constantly withdrawn from my balance in the amount of 7.5 rubles per day!  Please tell me how to cancel the subscription?  And who will return the money to me for the balance for these 2 months? ‚Äù </blockquote><blockquote>  "Mne prishlo soopshenie o tom cto Ya vigral po layku i doljen oplatit konvertatsiyu deneg v summe 170.r 00kop v SimplePay naznacenie sp * 15157517 kak vas ponyat?" </blockquote><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI am a pensioner and I want to get 32 ‚Äã‚ÄãGB of expansion on a Yandex disk.  What document should I provide?  In the passport is my date of birth 12/13/1943, and, of course, that the age of retirement.  Waiting for your positive response. ‚Äù </blockquote><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI was told that Kaspersky Yandex browser does not protect.  I have the main programs there. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Our ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù type of references: a person shared an event from his life - we were happy for him.  But seriously, every time the support service staff has a choice: to ignore such an appeal or to spend time and ask the applicant why he sent information in the feedback form that has no relation to our projects.  You can spend a lot more time explaining that we have nothing to do with the events happening to him and, as a result, remain guilty of the fact that our support service does not provide advice.

    <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">for example</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Please tell me who to contact in order to deliver the parcel delivered from abroad to the addressee without any further delay.  The delivery delay is attributed by the Russian Post workers to the fact that customs wants to receive from the addressee 4000rub. Because of the kilogram limit for one month.  What is this innovation?  The parcel was sent on 02/28/2018, the deadline for return is 15 days.  There are no prohibited goods in the package, the weight of the package does not exceed the established limit (20 kg) weight - 18.440 kg.  The parcel is not handed to the addressee and deadlines for return are violated.  How to be? </blockquote>  Hello!  Apparently, you were mistaken by the addressee. <blockquote>  You claim that you know everything about the Russian Post.  Help me please.  What is the point again to contact the PR operator? </blockquote>  We do not claim that we know everything about the Post of Russia. </div></div><br>  <b>Moral:</b> when someone complains that he contacted the support service, but they did not help him, you should not blindly take his words for granted, but make sure that he addressed ‚Äúto the address‚Äù, i.e.  to the support service that is directly related to the events discussed. <br><br><h2>  And such rubbish all day ... </h2><br><blockquote>  Already several times I read the message: "Billionaire Mark Zuckerberg - the founder of Facebook, is going to donate a 99% stake in Facebook to charity."  So I want to know when he will donate his shares?  I am a pensioner from Russia with a very small pension.  about $ 160. Throughout my life, my family and I received a small salary.  lived very poorly.  But I do not want to improve my well-being.  Since childhood, my dream is that all my relatives - brothers, sisters and all nephews - live together.  together. Or in the same house apartments for 20-25 or in houses.  located close to each other. The fate scattered us around the country.  but I want to connect everyone and communicate with everyone at least the last years of my life (I am 64 years old). I have been dreaming of this since childhood.  and now.  when the older generation is gone. the more.  But we are all poor and we don‚Äôt and will not have the means to move and build houses.  maybe.  Could Mark Zuckerberg realize my dream and make a person happy 100 of my relatives. We just need funds to build housing in one place in the Russian small town of Kirov. ?? !!!  To do this.  maybe.  donate me even less.  than 0.99% of Facebook shares.?!  Why shouldn't Mark start fulfilling his promise from me - a poor pensioner from a Russian remote place ?!  THINK.  WHAT MY LETTER.  My cry of a wounded soul.  DO NOT TRANSFER MARK TO ZUKERBERG.  THESE LETTERS ARE NOT PASSED.  NONE THERE IS A DEAL OF PERSONS. </blockquote><br>  Such an interesting message came to us once from the feedback form on Giktatimes, and from the feedback form on the <a href="https://toster.ru/">Toaster</a> we received a huge number of calls related to the Odnoklassniki service: requests to return money written off for a particular service or purchase in one of the games, requests remove annoying ads ( <i>probably embedded by some kind of virus</i> ) and so on.  Here are the most vivid examples of such references: <br><br><blockquote>  "Good day!  You can ask one question, I will give an example: as soon as I go to the site to "classmates", another person who is in another country (Ukraine), simultaneously with me at the same time comes to the site and with me goes out in time .  How is this possible????  This happens only when I log in from my device (phone or computer). Is it related to my account?  phone number?  Please help me figure it out!  And how to make so that this person could not see and know when I go to the site or any social.  network." </blockquote><blockquote>  " <s>This appeal has been deleted at the request of readers</s> " </blockquote><blockquote>  ‚ÄúONE AND TOO BAD.  GROUPS DIFFERENT AND ALL ONE AND ALSO.  AND EVERY MINUTES AND DAYS ONE AND ALSO.  AND MORE THIS.  Hakhatushki.  AND THERE ARE NOT UNDERSTANDING.  WATCH YOUR GROUPS ¬ª </blockquote><br>  The presence of such appeals can somehow be explained by the presence on our resources of <a href="https://tmtm.ru/corpblogs/">corporate blogs of</a> the companies mentioned, or, as is the case with the Zuckerberg stories, of <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/266794/">individual publications</a> .  However, there are those whose reason for hitting our feedback form remains a real mystery to us.  For example, from the form on <a href="https://geektimes.ru/">Giktayms</a> we somehow wrote: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello!  There is at least 20 kg of copper (crumb) and 20 kg of aluminum (sheets) and a magnet for free!  I am st High 12, pickup!  All this is in the device called biomagnet bm-4 invented in 1993.  It looks like a large refrigerator, copper and aluminum can be more as the device weighs 100 kg. If you are interested, call urgently on Monday morning or earlier, otherwise I will give the buyers free of charge! </blockquote><br>  And from the feedback form on the TM ID periodically receive appeals in the spirit of: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI ordered the watch Patek Phillip and the purse, the watch came completely different track code 60302820017452‚Äù </blockquote><blockquote>  "Fire stranger please send a guy" </blockquote><blockquote>  "Transferring money is not right where" </blockquote><br><h2>  What is our life?  A game! </h2><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúHello, I need help when my page was hacked, then I changed the data that is attached to the game, now I can‚Äôt unlock the game, I don‚Äôt know how to unlock the interface, but I don‚Äôt know who else to ask for help?  I have screenshots that this is my account and I provided my passport to the support service, but for some reason they said that I am not the account owner, I don‚Äôt already know who will contact you, can you help?  Initially, as it was 07/07/18, I was hacked, I immediately went to my room and I didn‚Äôt have the password, I realized that they had hacked me and immediately went to the support service and wrote to them, they said that they blocked my account <br>  In general, when I restored my e-mail there was someone else‚Äôs last name and first name and number unknown my photo when I changed everything I immediately wrote to the support service explaining that I was hacked but then I had to wait for the investigation 4 days I waited I took off the screenshots they asked for my passport they threw them after that they said that I am not the owner of this account, please reconsider thanks " </blockquote><blockquote>  "Can you help me?  I did not wait for a response from the support of the Ministry of Arts in the Game of War game, so I am writing to you.  If you are from Ulyanovsk, then you understand how hard money is being made in our country.  I do not live in Ulyanovsk itself, but in the region, in Dimitrovgrad, donat money is not always enough.  I ask you to help me, due to an error in the game, many players who were able to take advantage of it, have grown very powerful.  Now between the players who could take advantage and who not.  Huge abyss, please help me with resources and special resources, because other players don‚Äôt really develop.  They burn both on the map with the resources and in the attack.  Please understand the situation and help me with resources.  I would be very grateful. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  Although we are not from Ulyanovsk, we are well aware of how hard money is being made ... but, unfortunately, we cannot help in such situations. <br><br><h2>  Looking for advice from an IT specialist </h2><br>  Of course, in view of the themes of our resources, we often receive appeals from the ‚Äútyprogrammer‚Äù series: <br><br><blockquote>  Hello!  Very interesting is the possibility of creating a search engine with advertising and a mail server.  What programs need to be used with this?  How much server space will it take?  How much do you charge for such a project?  For what reasons, having such knowledge did not apply them in life? </blockquote><br>  The last question is especially good.  There is a feeling that the author managed to live in the Soviet Union.  Something feels like this in this question ... a <s>party</s> sublime or something.  Already you begin to feel responsible for the fate of humanity. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúPlease help me figure it out.  I met a man on the site "Dating".  We keep chatting on Hangouts.  My message says that his profile has been deleted from the site.  At the same time, the window ‚ÄúWho already has your friends here‚Äù comes to me in his window with his other photo and country of residence.  He says that the profile has been deleted.  Then what I see?  Maybe it's old or his new profile?  Tell me, please, how can I open and see his profile?  Or clarify when this profile was registered.  Thank you in advance." </blockquote><blockquote> "Good day!  I am not a programmer and generally far from it, but I would really like to learn something useful and I think it will be in the future.  And now I just typed in a search engine how to open my spouse's e-mail and left your site first, with the hope that there are those who can help me register with you!  I beg you to help me with this!  I work on business trips, all my savings in the family, but recently the spouse has changed and I want to understand what's the matter, even if someone has it, this is life and I am not around!  I want to understand how far it has gone from them!  I really ask you great programmers help me open Her mailbox!  I believe that there are such specialists!  Thank" </blockquote><br>  You do not even know where to begin the answer to the author of the appeal: from the fact that we do not provide this kind of service or from the explanation that his thoughts are criminal. <br><br>  And the head of this madness hit parade is a request to help remove the home video that has fallen into the network.  Unfortunately, the exact text of the request has not been preserved to this day, since  At that time, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis publication has not yet taken shape.  But we remember that we really wanted to ask the authors to send a sample of the video, making it necessary to determine which of the millions of videos presented on the Internet was made with their participation. <br><br><h2>  Undeliverable offers </h2><br>  Among other things, we regularly receive very attractive offers, for example: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúHello, I have a promising offer for the company.  That will improve the production.  What special site to make an offer on?  Answer.  I have a good offer that will make the company more than others.  Notify me in which site to make an offer.  And advice to improve the site please, where it would be more convenient to offer ideas, suggestions.  By mail, for example, I made an offer, you answered in a letter that you are satisfied with the offer.  You are considering a proposal.  And I do it completely, laying out the idea.  By mail.  Feedback. " </blockquote><blockquote>  ‚ÄúHi, UFO!  I propose to add to the site a new hub called: Health Complex (for smokers) I think that it is needed, because: my idea is worth it, but it is suitable for people with good capital to implement. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  And the other day we received a brilliant proposal to create a global social network for IT-specialists ... probably already the hundredth in a row. <br><br><h2>  Strengthening spiritual braces </h2><br><blockquote>  Good day!  I propose to add the hub "Orthodoxy" on Habr√©.  Before my letter goes to the basket I will try to explain where such a crazy idea came from.  My name is <s>hereBy</s> name, the Orthodox priest himself, but at the same time also an IT specialist.  I did a bunch of projects for the Church (from websites, to databases and PBX servers).  Now I am working as a manager <s>here</s> . The <s>name of the Church Division</s> .  At one of our conferences, I got into conversation with <s>hereWhileName GuruSEO</s> .  And he lamented the following situation, that in society there is a negative attitude towards the Orthodox Church.  The problem is more artificially created (what he was just telling about at the conference).  And today, the technical elite does not see intellectual novelty in Orthodoxy, although it certainly exists.  You can not reduce everything to priests in Mercedes and stupid grandmothers.  The church is a huge cultural stratum.  Well, to my question, what to do with this, he just threw up his hands: ‚ÄúWe need some kind of bridge that will connect IT people and will speak with them in one language, some evangelist.‚Äù  It is a little indiscreet to try to call yourself "an evangelist for IT people."  But I really can tell interesting and understandable for IT people about complex issues, try to broaden their horizons.  I can only promise one thing: if the hub is suddenly created, then there definitely will not be rigorism, moralizing, but there will be an interesting story in the IT style about such a complex social thing as the Orthodox Church.  Give "Orthodoxy" on Habr√© :) </blockquote><br>  Of course, we promised to think about this brilliant idea, although it was tempting to offer to purchase a subscription to a corporate blog. <br><br><h2>  In the struggle for independence </h2><br>  <i>This fragment of the publication was hidden at the request of users.</i>  <i>Despite the publication date (April 1), the publication was faced with the task of not cheering up users, but of telling about the everyday life of the support service.</i>  <i>Some users painfully perceived a critical discussion of situations in which representatives of certain political forces tried to force the administration of the resource to abandon political neutrality and begin to lobby for their interests.</i>  <i>In order to avoid new political discussions, we decided to remove this fragment of the publication.</i>  <i>Thank you for understanding!</i> <br><br><h2>  Mexican passion </h2><br>  For a long time, ‚Äú <a href="https://moikrug.ru/">My Circle</a> ‚Äù had a problem of a different kind: the support service regularly received letters addressed to users.  This happened until we had guessed to ask our developers to change the inscription of the link leading to the form of sending a message to the support service from ‚Äúfeedback‚Äù to ‚Äúsupport service‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Moral:</b> in order to avoid misunderstanding, use for feedback forms the names that accurately reflect their purpose. <br><br>  However, it does not always help.  The most enchanting of the appeals we received ( <i>it arrived in December 2016, the form under the link ‚ÄúThis company requires an administrator‚Äù, the names of the participants, of course, changed</i> ) was as follows: <br><br><blockquote>  Vasily Vasilyevich Vasilyev, you (Vaska LLC) need an administrator to edit the company's card and manage other employees, so think about your WIFE Vasilisa Vasilyevna Vasilyeva with professional computer education. But keep in mind, continue to work with the CAM.  With respect ... you will manage without respect.?  Vasya, what is my email?  did you create me an e-mail?  (? I ask to appoint me as the administrator of the company "Vaska"?) </blockquote><br>  The return email address of the sender ‚Äúwith professional computer education‚Äù turned out to be incorrect, so we could not warn him that he was mistaken by the addressee, and some time later a no less touching continuation was received: <br><br><blockquote>  With a small amendment at the end of the letter P O V T O R N O!  Vasya, yesterday sent you a letter about work, so today you yourself are ugly: ‚Äúthere are no vacancies in the company‚Äù, this is not surprising for you from me.  I remind you, my husband Vasya terminated my husband, your wife Vasilisa, my phone number is +7 XXX XXX XX XX.  I accept from you, Vasya, sms-messages and calls.  Today I saw a dream from the pictures: 1. we are in the training plane in the air: you prop the wall of the plane, and what I do, I will not tell you, Vasya, 2. Valentina Petrovna in the room-hall cries with tears and wipes tears Own, 3. Neighbor goes through this room-hall, 4. I don‚Äôt want to describe this picture to you, Vasya.  Why such a dream?  To the end, the dream overlooked and woke up thinking about a dream.  Vasya, for 19 years of your absence, I inscribed letters of love with different emotions to you with DIFFERENT EMOTIONS and postcards while I figured out who is who, and now I have a decision: 1. You come back and live your life for the good of my life. , 2. you do not come back, and we are with you, Vasya, you need to draw up the documents as I want, namely: to recognize the marriage of Vasily Vasilievich Vasilyevyh VALID since the date of the first registration of the XX-April-199th year for the reason and for this Day of the absence of responsibility of Vasily Vasilievich Vasilva at once  development of the family of Vasily Vasilisa Vasilyev.  I do not want you, Vasya, to be in any marriage relationship: neither registered nor terminated.  (in 19 years it is possible for three children to grow out, and you, Vasya, do not know how to make repairs at home., but the Director is still there .... I want Vasya to be free from you: in life and in documents. Everything, Vasya, people are like people - all help each other, and you ‚ÄúI, ME, MY, GIVE‚Äù "are boring. I'm sick. Here, again, I don‚Äôt know on which shelves your" exploits "are spread out, Vasya ... Your wife Vasilisa Vasilyeva (? I ask you to appoint me as administrator the company "Vaska"?) </blockquote><br>  We believe that the examples we have given illustrate quite clearly why all the more or less large web services diligently complicate the process of contacting the support service, by hook and crook redirecting its users to the pages of ready answers to popular questions.  We sincerely hope that this publication will help you in the future to treat such ‚Äúadministrative barriers‚Äù with more patience and understanding. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/336928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/336928/</a></p>
