  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How are interviews done between reports and a small report on DevOops</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  DevOops is a conference dedicated exclusively to DevOps issues.  It was last week and I want to share my impressions. </p><br><p>  Many people watched online interviews in between reports, and I was their presenter.  How it all looks from the inside - it will be under the cut.  <b>So many things happened</b> , the schedule is so tight that even a photo could be taken only occasionally.  For example, this is filmed on the <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/cyber-shot-compact-cameras/dsc-rx100m5">RX100 with</a> trembling hands from the opening of the conference: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-y/is/up/-yisup6vkf8z9ydam_6ssy7qrve.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  The horizon is naturally littered.  The camera has the ability to turn on the horizon, but it‚Äôs quite difficult to do when there are only a few seconds in the photo. </p><br><p>  So, what is the life of a leading online interview during a conference? </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="scenariy">  Scenario </h1><br><p>  There are two programs of the conference - one general, with many reports, and the second - a schedule of breaks between them.  Between any two presentations, there are interviews with speakers or other important conference participants. </p><br><p>  A day before the hour, we already have a clear understanding of what will happen in the breaks.  To do this, we sit down with Zhenya Trifonov ( <a href="https://habr.com/users/phillennium/" class="user_link">phillennium</a> ) and write the script in Google: </p><br><p><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9m/wj/dx/9mwjdxvwocerduhndhsgndook70.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  The key difference between speakers is in their topics and the language they speak.  We can conduct some topics ourselves, and for some we need experts.  Some say it simply and clearly, but for someone you need a connoisseur of southern accents.  It is interesting that during the report everyone speaks simply and clearly, but this does not apply to personal communication and interviews. </p><br><p>  In this case, the members of the program committee, Victor Gamov and Andrei Kogun, helped us. </p><br><h1 id="v-processe">  In the process </h1><br><p>  What does it mean to conduct an interview during the conference. </p><br><ul><li>  Write a script of the day; </li><li>  Validate the schedule for the program.  The speaker should not be interviewed just before his report, plus they have preferences: English-speaking comrades only want to speak when there are no English-speaking reports at this time, someone wants to visit the Hermitage and etc. </li><li>  Agree with each speaker about the interview; </li><li>  To think over questions (usually this is done in advance for several days - reports are viewed on YouTube with their participation, articles are read); </li><li>  Find a speaker at the site; </li><li>  Check that the operators are in place and everything works (especially if the equipment needs to be moved - for example, move to the sponsors' stands); </li><li>  Bring it to the place; </li><li>  Omikrofonit microphones, buttonholes and other trifles; </li><li>  Check that the directors of the general broadcast are ready to insert your part into the general stream; </li><li>  <strong>Conduct an interview</strong> ; </li><li>  Thank the speaker and bring him back. </li></ul><br><p>  Sometimes you have to help fix problems.  This <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/09/23/the-duct-tape-programmer/">photo with tape was</a> taken when we tried to understand the problems with cable sizing before the first interview was broadcast: </p><br><p><img width="300" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xh/bq/qi/xhbqqi2gcaijenuodrrhrwu1ees.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  (If you wanted to find out how black insulating tape is peeled off from a beard, then so-so, not so much it comes off). </p><br><p>  From this only one point is visible on the screen - ‚Äúconduct an interview‚Äù. </p><br><p>  All operational work must be done in the 40 minutes between the interviews, while the report is on. </p><br><p>  The question is - is there any time to participate in the conference? </p><br><h1 id="vstrechi-so-spikerami">  Meetings with speakers </h1><br><p>  One of the coolest opportunities is to meet any speaker in person and talk to him.  I always try to take a selfie with key members.  Show grandchildren!  When they appear, hehe. </p><br><p>  Anton Weiss from Otomato: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ro/fl/7h/rofl7heuy8iohqnut89geo_johi.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  Between me and Victor, the father of all devops, John Willis, the author of the DevOps Handbook and the Beyond the Phoenix Project: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9i/cf/rx/9icfrxofgy2obolvriqtrl_abq0.jpeg"><br></p><br><h1 id="a-doklady">  And the reports? </h1><br><p>  Speakers are good, but what about the reports and the main program?  With this much more complicated.  The beginning and end of the report, as you remember, are eaten to work on the start and finalize the interview. </p><br><p>  Sometimes you can make a good picture.  Here Baruch burns a verb at the opening of the conference: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/co/ao/hi/coaohis90t3brsxzdkekwcvqjk4.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  In order to avoid a collapse of the horizon, there will be further pictures from our <a href="https://vk.com/devoops">group on VKontakte</a> and other social networks. </p><br><h1 id="registraciya">  check in </h1><br><p>  First, each participant must register and receive a badge in addition to souvenirs in the bag.  This is a pass in order to move freely throughout the site. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ce/du/mn/cedumnyvhtg42wvn4cimzqo7twe.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  At the registration there were <b>a lot of</b> familiar faces.  At some point, even had to leave from there in order to have a chance to do work, and not just to greet.  Almost like in Robotsyp: </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7zXn57WT4sQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  It seems that all our Facebook community has migrated straight to DevOops. </p><br><h1 id="otkrytie">  Opening </h1><br><p>  As always, the conference begins with the opening.  Of course, all this was in the <a href="https://devoops.ru/onlinefree/">open free online broadcast</a> , but as it turned out - some people wrote it all off and on video!  A little pointless, but fun and pleasant.  Thank you, Nastya! </p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MBciMkItbuk" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  There were, of course, our dear sponsors.  Not to mention which I can not, if only because Alyona was there, with whom we once had a lot of communication on the preparation of interesting articles on Habr. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0d/ji/op/0djiopbwlcs-cb2oc46j0qpzsic.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  There is one photo here, because the place on Habr√© is not rubber.  Thanks to <strong>all</strong> our sponsors for their contribution to the development of the conference! </p><br><h1 id="otkryvayuschiy-keynout">  Opening keyout </h1><br><p>  Our conference opens and closes keyout.  The opening keyout is almost the most important report.  He sets the direction and spirit of the conference.  In this case, his father leads the devops - John Willis.  It‚Äôs hard to think of a better person for this role! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ue/ed/tm/ueedtmmz6ymfcdlyiksfpnxzvpa.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  After the conference, participants fill in feedback with questions about the quality of reports.  To be fair, according to feedback, you can see a lot of polar opinions.  For example, John spoke emotionally in colloquial English - and someone really liked it, but someone was hard to understand.  John talked about big things, and for some it became a source of inspiration (actually, what keynout was intended for), but someone didn‚Äôt like the scale - not all companies employ more than ten people.  It seems to me that polarization is good, it means that the report has something to discuss. </p><br><h1 id="doklady">  Reports </h1><br><p>  There were a lot of reports.  Interesting, complex, fiery.  For every taste, color and size. </p><br><p>  Here is Anton Weiss from Otomato with the report <a href="https://devoops.ru/2018/spb/talks/5bi1asblpyyma0cy4cwqgo">"Stupid services in smart networks: deploy as a ninja with the help of Istio service mesh"</a> .  As someone in feedback said: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know anything about Istio.  But now I know and want.  I liked the example of expanding the functionality - it is nice to know in advance that it is possible to expand. ‚Äù </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vc/qg/5i/vcqg5i_uy5rckhwi9fo2os0qxii.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  Here is Liz Rice from Aqua Security (chairman of Cubs) who teaches <a href="https://devoops.ru/2018/spb/talks/2yl4oqifo4oqqmwwgwg4as/">how to protect containers</a> .  As one of the participants said: ‚ÄúWhat a shame!  I need to urgently redo container security! ‚Äù </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qo/_z/ss/qo_zsscfyefzohl1m9iy2gpwl58.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  But the famous Google Evangelist Seth Vargo, also about security, this time the <a href="https://devoops.ru/2018/spb/talks/14ss0jq4v8ci4ekuoewew6/">security of microservices</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sf/rm/vn/sfrmvnbibp8-qrfepltyyez-mpe.jpeg"><br></p><br><p> Here's Alena Prokhorchik, lead engineer and manager at Rancher, talks about creating a platform for <a href="https://devoops.ru/2018/spb/talks/4jxbqr3jtiiewc6wsaousm/">managing Kubernetes clusters</a> .  Interestingly, this is one of the few reports (not only on DevOops, but in general), about which you can hear such reviews: ‚ÄúAlthough the report was about the tool, but there was no obvious advertising.  I brought a lot of useful information on how to expand the k8s. ‚Äù  Or, ‚ÄúThe reasons for writing your bicycle were described very well, and a separate test for problem analysis‚Äù.  Making a report on your own product in such a way as to collect a ton of positive is a special art. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-s/t1/zn/-st1znpbojb5epjkrkpigzu-bxq.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  Well, where is it without Igolnik and Baruch?  Check out the costumes. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qb/mi/rb/qbmirbmisj-7kwtnyzslvsnpdww.jpeg"><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pq/fj/fm/pqfjfmebvea_cm5gz3_qtdznat8.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  The participants also received the report very positively: ‚ÄúBaruch and Leonid give a show.  In a good way.  On the one hand, you have fun, even have fun, and on the other hand, you understand and accept one, but deep thought.  In this case, what, what and how to measure. ‚Äù </p><br><p>  I could list for a very long time, but the size of the post on Habr√© is not rubber.  There are not all photos of all speakers for this reason only!  All reports and speakers were very good. </p><br><p>  It is necessary to mention a few important things that were available offline. </p><br><h1 id="diskussionnye-zony">  Discussion areas </h1><br><p>  The discussion zones on this DevOops were extremely hot.  Compared to other conferences, discussions on devops are distinguished by increased practical applicability, increased polarization of opinions and heated emotions. </p><br><p>  Not only among the participants, but also among the speakers - when Vitya can gather so many Kafka supporters at the same time, right?  :-) </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fu/n5/vp/fun5vpfyppv_-un5aim9ydbf0do.jpeg"><br></p><br><h1 id="avtograf-sessiya-dzhona">  John's autograph session </h1><br><p>  Some speakers are authors of their own books.  And of course, John Willis comes to mind first, whose books were sold directly on DevOops, and the author signed the books in between the reports.  In general, John was at this conference a lot, almost on a par with Baruch.  He dragged for three and on the report, and in the breaks, but he also managed to walk on the reports and had his own opinion on everything.  Maybe someday he will come to us again, and this will become a good tradition. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gu/hj/2h/guhj2hn20uph0s3xi3uzgoo75_u.jpeg"><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n0/si/nt/n0sint7wkuoiu9toza462jwiaye.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  Here is a Telegram review from one of our members: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9r/w7/1d/9rw71ditb_vqbvxhatcgp7fvgb8.jpeg"><br></p><br><h1 id="fotografii-so-spikerami">  Photos with speakers </h1><br><p>  It was taken off scale number of photos.  Selfies were made in relation to everything with everyone. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/2d/th/qz/2dthqzpaahjijru6ulbcnwjorjk.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  Everyone especially liked to be photographed with Baruch and the Needlehead in their new costumes.  Photos made automated booth in front of which you can stand and pose. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w0/ik/co/w0ikcow2a808kvvhjhpw4utuggo.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  I just put my camera in the room for speakers, because why work on my own if photos appear faster on Twitter than you can watch them? </p><br><h1 id="svobodnoe-obschenie-demozona-i-stendy-sponsorov">  Free communication, demo zone and sponsor stands </h1><br><p>  For those who talked in the discussion areas, there was always something else to do. </p><br><p>  You can holivarit: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4k/a4/cm/4ka4cmsm-21mgrzepfld0pvvr6y.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  You can listen to the mini-reports of the sponsors: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rg/fx/du/rgfxdutrpaywqchzpdcp31rigbc.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  I do not quite understand how it is possible to master so many reports at the same time on one day.  How to tamp in yourself so much information.  But judging by the crowds of participants, listening to reports after the reports is more than a popular activity! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u2/i5/gr/u2i5gr75a1fx4zoh3fcqrnh-1lm.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  It was possible to take part in various drawings, quizzes and problem solving.  On a photo something plays Align Technology: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dy/uh/fr/dyuhfrrsvyredpan4ktuip6kdjq.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  I myself, obviously, could not participate in all these tournaments: it would be unfair for one of the organizers to dominate at his own event.  But on the other hand, we solved problems just for fun reasons, and some of them caused a lot of controversy and discussion.  For example, is it necessary to know Bash syntax in 2018?  Question!  Holivary is good and interesting. </p><br><p>  As always, I would like to note: there were many sponsors, and they tried their best.  It is impossible to list everything here simply because in this case you never finish the fasting until the end. </p><br><h1 id="zavershayuschiy-keynout">  Final keyout </h1><br><p>  But here comes the evening, and the conference time to close.  The final keyout summarizes everything that happened during this long day and lays some big thoughts for the future. </p><br><p>  This time, this most important mission was undertaken by Kirill Tolkachev and Alexander Titov with a landmark report <a href="https://devoops.ru/2018/spb/talks/xbysjjiyx6uwq48uksu2u">‚ÄúDevOps, Engineers and the Community‚Äù</a> . </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ct/kx/e3/ctkxe3kq5p7bk7bfef9s0jhx37q.jpeg"><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4e/bl/4p/4ebl4p7t0zyn0mly70bpuvzhqqy.jpeg"><br></p><br><h1 id="zakrytie">  Closing </h1><br><p>  At the end, the final speeches were read out, Andrei Dmitriev traditionally asked to fill out a feedback form in English (for English speakers): </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xv/v5/pw/xvv5pwwjgduqt4dfnouwapjakog.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  And all the speakers went up to the stage: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7x/y0/19/7xy019t7ptu0rzad7ig6igcn17a.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  After that, Andrei Kogun and I had to quickly deliver Andrei Dmitriev and Alexei Fyodorov to the online interview zone, where we had our own option for closing. </p><br><h1 id="bof">  Bof </h1><br><p>  Closing everything, in fact, does not end there.  Further we were waited by a party, "karaoke battle" and bofy.  And cheers - I have no more interviews in the online studio, you can normally participate in this! </p><br><p>  BoF is now a traditional format at our conferences.  Something like a round table or discussion group in which everyone can take part. </p><br><p>  If you are interested, BoF stands for ‚Äúbirds of a feather‚Äù, and its origin is counted from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)">first IETF rallies</a> . </p><br><p>  And yes, it came out very, very well.  It would seem that during the day people will hear enough of the reports and talk about it, that after closing they will immediately go eat and sleep.  But no!  You can‚Äôt just stop talking about devops. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/78/f-/ui/78f-uizsnbotkblc1pkcpywzeeo.jpeg"><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3n/mi/hw/3nmihwwxvxdfhj7jmpckqi06sey.jpeg"><br></p><br><h1 id="vecherinka">  A party </h1><br><p>  It's simple.  For those who are still a little tired and want to relax, there is a full-scale party with drinks, snacks and music.  In order to avoid anything, I will illustrate with a couple of politically correct photos (but you understand that everything was much bigger). </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ja/fx/kx/jafxkxdurb6p5ka8v70fxvqcqf8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/if/-g/eyif-g5t_c9xzdx1jlz7amhchws.jpeg"><br><br><h1 id="ignite-karaoke-battle">  Ignite Karaoke Battle </h1><br><p>  In the middle of the party was an interesting thing.  The rules are simple.  In the center of the hall there is a stage with a projector and slides.  Two participants step on the stage and tell something on the basis of slides, which they, of course, have never seen before.  And the slides there are fire - short, capacious and on a large set of topics.  At times there were openly brain-slides, for example, here, hold bananas: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e4/0r/fx/e40rfx7c-oie8tz6tyj7way-bi0.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  Baruch brought all the successes on a special tournament board.  It's all serious. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pl/yg/nn/plygnn-mmki60dhs4ibo5sha19s.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  It was very amusing that our leader, <a href="https://habr.com/users/23derevo/" class="user_link">23derevo, also</a> tried himself in this competition.  And of course, General Marketing - <a href="https://habr.com/users/arg89/" class="user_link">ARG89</a> , in the past he was well versed in the development, so he was able to participate in the fun on an equal footing.  True, he did not become a winner ... This is not writing articles on Habr√©, right?  :-) </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xk/ud/1j/xkud1jeafu2uzx0j9e3bewmnqje.jpeg"><br></p><br><p>  And all this under the furious roar of the audience! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cv/19/zo/cv19zo8n-12zbvyrys-h_zjehdm.jpeg"><br></p><br><h1 id="pezyume">  Summary </h1><br><p>  The conference was a success.  There were cool reports, star speakers, bafa, a party with "karaoke" - all that your heart desires. </p><br><p>  The next DevOops to be!  And now a two-day.  We will inform you on Habr√© in the course of preparation, publish interviews and transcripts of reports - in short, everything is as usual.  See you next year! </p></div>
