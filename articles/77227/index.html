  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A few webs about Google DNS</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>The author is technical director of <a href="http://www.opendns.com/about/overview/">OpenDNS</a> <a href="http://www.opendns.com/about/david/">David Ulevitch</a> , one of the founders of the company.</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/12/introducing-google-public-dns.html">Today</a> , almost four years after the founding of OpenDNS, Google launched the DNS service.  This is not surprising, since it was only a matter of time when one of the Internet giants was aware of the strategic importance of the DNS.  I received a lot of questions from bloggers, journalists, friends and, most importantly, our users.  And so I want to share my thoughts on what it means for the recursive DNS space and what it means for OpenDNS. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>First</b> , it is not the same as OpenDNS.  When using the DNS service from Google, you get the experience that you prescribe.  When using OpenDNS, you get a control panel to manage your experience in the most convenient way for you, your family or your organization.  People use OpenDNS because we are pioneers and innovators offering the safest DNS environment.  We have the largest DNS cache, the fastest resolvers, and we offer the most flexibility in managing your DNS experience.  For example, IT-savvy people want to block malicious sites in the DNS, parents sometimes want to block certain content from children.  All this and more is possible with the help of OpenDNS.  This is not possible with the DNS from Google.  Of course, we do not impose it, we only offer these opportunities, which you manage as you like.  Giving people choices is our main suggestion. <br><br>  <b>Secondly</b> , this means that Google is creating its DNS service as an essential part of the Internet infrastructure.  It is of strategic importance to help people navigate safely and securely over the Internet.  This is what we have spoken with from the very first day and will always keep it as our main task.  That is why large businessmen are switching to OpenDNS: not because it is free, but because we are the best and we will increase the security of their networks.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>Thirdly</b> , Google claims that their service is the best because there are no advertisements or redirects on it.  But you must remember that Google is also the largest advertising company on the Internet.  To think that the Google DNS Service was created solely for the benefit of the Internet would be naive.  They know how <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/now-google-wants-to-control-even-more-of-your-internet-2009-12">useful it is to control your history of visits to Internet resources</a> , and I would expect them to study it in full.  And of course, we always protect user privacy and never sell our DNS data.  Read our <a href="http://www.opendns.com/privacy/">privacy policy</a> . <br><br>  <b>Fourthly</b> , this means that Google informs a wide audience that there is a choice, and that users do not have to be content with what the DNS provider provides.  And we think that having a choice is good.  Just as Internet users have the opportunity to reorganize their email using Gmail, Yahoo!  Mail or Hotmail, over the past 3 years, many people switched to OpenDNS, because we are better than another DNS. <br><br>  <b>Fifth</b> , it‚Äôs not at all obvious that Internet users really want to let Google keep control over more and more of their Internet activity than they already have: in the chain of Google‚Äôs Chrome OS and Google‚Äôs search, DNS becomes the final touch in the infrastructure Google, the largest advertising company in the world.  I prefer a heterogeneous Internet with a large number of collaborating members that support its work, as opposed to the Internet run by one large company. <br><br>  How will this affect us?  It is too early to say, but basically I think that is a good thing for us.  Google's DNS does not currently offer either choice or flexibility, which cannot be said about our service.  It is new and not yet tested.  By doing this, Google encourages us to continue to make our service better.  And ultimately, this is a business that has become more aggressive since we entered the market, but so far we have won fair competition.  This raises awareness of the importance of DNS and it encourages us to continue to provide world-class services to a global audience and support innovation. <br><br>  We will continue to do our job without being distracted by the challenges of Google or any other players in the field of DNS and network security.  But we welcome the neighborhood with Google in this area. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77227/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77227/</a></p>
