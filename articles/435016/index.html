There was friction with Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and others.  Nevertheless, he has serious allies.  Larry Page of Google even talked about leaving his fortune to Mask after his death.  And Ilona is often considered the godfather of the mafia PayPal, which includes major players who later founded several companies that you could hear about (for example, LinkedIn, Yelp, YouTube). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Be that as it may, Tesla recently announced the <a href="https://habr.com/post/434848/">appointment of</a> two new board members.  The appointment of Caitlin Wilson-Thompson, the first elect of the company's board of directors, was far-sighted.  Her expertise in personnel management (from Walgreens to Kelloggs) gives Tesla some critical skills in employee management, precisely when the company is preparing for rapid growth.  But investors also <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/325446">liked the</a> second new addition to Tesla - the Silicon Valley icon, which may have some impact on the Mask - Larry Ellison. <br><br>  Yes, this is Larry Ellison - the founder of Oracle and one of the richest people in the world, who starred as a cameo along with Mask in ‚ÄúIron Man 2‚Äù, - notes <a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1120680_iron-man-2-reunion-musk-friend-larry-ellison-named-to-tesla-board">Green Car Reports</a> .  In the early 1990s, Allison also served on another board of directors.  When Steve Jobs resumed control of Apple and catapulted it to new heights, it was Ellison Jobs who <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/598384/larry-ellison-one-of-steve-jobs-best-friends-is-joining-teslas-board/">took</a> Apple to the board of directors.

He owns several mansions on the Malibu coast, races on sailing yachts, owns motor yachts, drives exotic cars and owns almost all the land on Lanae, one of the Hawaiian islands. ‚Äù <br><br>  On the other hand, ‚ÄúMusk is ranked 54th on the Forbes list, with an estimated capital of $ 20 billion.‚Äù Lloyd Greif, head of an investment banking firm in Los Angeles, says: ‚ÄúLarry is a smart guy, a strong guy, he won't be a goat of the absolution. ... And he will pay attention to [Tesla] for various reasons, including his own wallet. ‚Äù <br><br>  Be that as it may, "74-year-old Allison is one of the loudest supporters of Mask and called him a" very close friend "at a meeting of financial analysts in October."
