There's a great selection of professional videos from Google engineers.  I recommend for viewing to anyone who works in IT and understands spoken English or wants to begin to understand it. <br><br>  One of the most shocking videos of me from there is a video from the opening of the google conference in May 2008: <br>  <a href="http://ru.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dvk1HvP7NO5w">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vk1HvP7NO5w</a> <br><br>  Next is my very brief summary of this report:

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  In fact, these are several reports combined into one.  This video fully reveals Google‚Äôs plans for <s>conquering the</s> development of the Internet. <br><ol><li>  Google is trying to develop the Internet, because  it gives them more customers, which means more money.  Development in their understanding is the development of browsers, the development of standards, the connection of new users, the simplification of using the Internet, so that everyone can use it and give their 5 cents to Google.  The idea is simple - the more people use the Internet, the more money Google has, because  Google is the undisputed leader in many types of services on the Internet. </li><li>  Google has a <a href="http://code.google.com/intl/ru/">page</a> where they post open source code that anyone can use.  The report shows examples of using Gears - API for turning a browser from a stupid terminal into a powerful monster machine.  The main idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãGears is to expand the capabilities of the browser and do as much work as possible on the client machine, and not on the server (sorting, searching, etc.).  There are plugins for Firefox and IE that really speed up the work, for example, Google mail. </li><li>  The development of the Internet leads to the fact that there are a lot of platforms from which people can connect to the Internet - for example, an unallocated number of different phones with Internet access, iphone, etc ... Google is struggling with this through the open source project Android.  In fact, an android is the entire stack of programs for mobile devices.  This is an operating system plus a browser, plus development tools, etc.  The basic idea is correct - standardization.  It remains to be seen how device manufacturers will support it.  I liked everything in Android, for example, how the unlocking of the keyboard was done - by drawing a special figure on the screen (the letter G of course :)).  I advise everyone to see this piece of presentation with a cell phone - approximately starting at 25 minutes - this is the future in the present! </li><li>  Google wants to share its capabilities with other developers.  For this, there is the open source Google app engine.  The basic idea is to give a simple engine and provide hosting for programs written on this engine.  As a result, developers avoid a huge heap of technical problems, and Google gets an increase in web popularity, which is what they are striving for.  The 3 main tasks of the Google app engine: <br>  - Make the creation of web applications as simple as possible. <br>  - Make the application extension as simple as possible. <br>  - To enable applications on this engine to be hosted on Google's servers (on clouds). <br>  From 36 minutes shows how to use this engine. <br>  This is all free, if the application being hosted is not very popular (less than 5 million views per month is quite enough for a small application. And if you have more views, make money from advertising and pay). </li><li>  Google Data APIs.  It starts from 44 minutes.  The main task is to give read \ write access to Google services. <br>  AJAX APIs - api to access information about the Web (search, rss, etc.).  Demonstrating these APIs from 46 minutes is very impressive! </li><li>  Google web toolkit.  56 minutes  This is a special offer for Java programmers.  This toolkit allows you to avoid all problems with browsers and write quickly and efficiently.  The main idea is to write in Java in any IDE, and compile it with a special tool in Java Script.  Plus a bunch of other useful tools and libraries that make it easy to work with AJAX.  I don't understand much about it, but it sounds cool. <br>  If you write in Java - do not take 12 minutes and see this piece of presentation. </li><li>  From 68 minutes Google talks about social networks (Social web).  Google offers its own standards OpenID, OAuth and OpenSocial.  OpenID, so as not to enter your data and do not register on each site.  OAuth to use OpenID.  OpenSocial to simplify and standardize the creation of social networks! <br>  C 77 minutes is a small presentation of how to use OpenSocial. </li></ol><br><br>  After viewing the presentation, which I outlined using the <a href="http://www.google.com/notebook/">Google Notebook</a> plugin, my attitude to Google has improved by many more points :) <br>  The only thing that upsets is that I do not write for the Web yet and do not use Java. <br>  But after watching this video, I want to start more and more ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37498/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37498/</a></p>
