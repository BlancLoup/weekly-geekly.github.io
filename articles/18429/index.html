  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cases of bygone days, the stories of olden times ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Here I was reading the revelations of habrovtsev and remembered my first experience of installing linux.  And then how did I immediately get lucky (or maybe without quotes? :)).  The matter was relatively long ago, and this problem seems to be no longer relevant today, because it is widely described, but then it is ubiquitous and urgent.  Yes, the same problem - ‚Äúati + niksy = X?‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In general, our department purchased three relatively powerful at that time computer for installing the ISE TCAD program (at the moment its reincarnation is called Synopsys TCAD due to the purchase of ISE by Sipopsis, if you are interested).  The computers contained already-not-remember-what-Intel-percent-and-corresponding-chipset (and they change so often), a couple of gigabytes of RAM and an ATI Radeon 9600. <br>  And since TCAD was originally intended to work under * nix, a nine-disk package was purchased for delivery ... ASPLinux =) All this economy was put in my hands - do what you can, but we want the program in working form. <br><br>  Attempt N 1

      Not suspecting a dirty trick, I set about installing the TSA on the first computer - at least to see what kind of a linux was this beast =) In the installer, I left everything by default, which later played a fatal role.  And now the installation is over, we are overloaded ... hmm.  Next to the console with an invitation it does not go.  X does not start. <br>  Here the dancing with a tambourine performed by an inexperienced user began ... oh no, root (I know, I know that there is a bad tone under the root - but still the computer was stand-alone, and I was a noob :)).  Fortunately, there was another hand with the Internet, just know how to use the search (no, no, setting up the interface from the console and using a text browser do not even stutter - I had another task :)).  The correct atishny firewood was successfully downloaded and an attempt was made to install it (before that, we had to mount a USB stick on which the firewood was transferred - such as a warm up for a chela, which for the first time * nix sees).  Here the system modestly asked for such a small rpm-bag from its storekeepers (nevertheless 9 disks after all).  I generously fed her the requested file ... then another ... and another ... and a couple more ... in general, the package on the tenth, tortured to change disks, I realized that this would not work.  Along the way, all the more, it turned out that even when installing firewood and running XWindow, DRI (Direct Rendering Interface) will not work for me due to the fact that in the standard kernel the default is the Mesa GLX library, which conflicts with the atgna fglrx.  The way out is to rebuild the core, throw out the mesa, turn on agpgart ... I don‚Äôt remember what else.  It was only then that my global error became clear to me at the installation stage - by default, ASPLinux is installed in the user's configuration, and not the developer, therefore, no kernel sources and other useful things are screwed onto the screw.  Attempting to merge the sources into the necessary folders from CDs manually did not lead to success - anyway, something was missing.  It was decided to score on the first pancake, turned out to be a lump, and start all over again. <br><br>  Attempt N 2 <br><br>  Again, the ASPLinux installation is ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù this time, with all the sorts.  Digging into the kernel config with a protruding tongue (xconfig for obvious reasons did not work, but menuconfig was also buggy for some reason).  At the same time, she turned off all sorts of unnecessary things on this computer, and transferred something to the modules.  Something else, I remember, needed to be corrected in graphic configs ... well, the experience gained at the dawn of youth when setting up GoldEd and T-Mail text configs helped notably. <br>  Pah-pah-pah ... well, make dep, make clean ... and holy spirit make bzImage =) <br>  Hooray, the world was created without errors, you can go to the creation of animal animals! <br>  make modules <br>  make modules_install <br>  Uffff ... <br>  It remains to fasten the creation of their hands on permanent residence and see what came of it all. <br>  And yet say - it happened! <br>  XWindow started up, DRI was working, the birds were chirping ... uh, where it took me :) In general, after all the ups and downs, I certainly felt like a Creator with a capital letter. <br>  It remained for the small - to make an image of the system and multiply on the remaining computers, the benefit of their configuration was exactly the same.  Well, put sobsno TCAD. <br><br>  However, this did not come to an end and everything was sad - the authorities found out that there is a version of TCAD under Windows, was delighted, ordered to demolish Linux and put everything on the ‚Äúvents‚Äù = ( <br>  How I had to mess around with crutches for the prog in the form of a x-ray server for Windows and other patches - a separate story. <br>  But I will definitely not forget my first installation experience. <br>  Hello everyone who went through the same!  :) <br><br>  <em>PS What is the use of this story?</em>  <em>And no, probably =) Everything that concerns the compatibility issues of Linux and Radeon is very easy to find, it‚Äôs late to write new tablets.</em>  <em>But a personal blog is a personal blog, so that it can express itself in the case without it ...)</em> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18429/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18429/</a></p>
