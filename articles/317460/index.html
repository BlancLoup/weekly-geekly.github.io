Part 3</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the middle of November, our friends from Sports.ru launched a course for those who want to <a href="https://product.degree/">become a product manager of</a> mobile applications.  Among the lecturers are employees of Sports.ru, AppFollow, Aviasales, Uber and other cool guys.  Throughout December, a student at <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/kirillkobelev/" class="user_link">kirillkobelev</a> teaches how the course is being taught.  Below is a report from lectures 4 and 5, which were devoted to painful questions for a novice product manager - monetization and management of the team.  This time, for a change, in the production drama genre. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Earlier in the series:</b> <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/appodeal/blog/316154/">Part 1 - who are product managers and a bit about design.</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/appodeal/blog/316654/">Part 2 - about the stages of application development.</a>

    <h2>  Act 4, in which the almost full namesake of a famous writer dissuades us from doing a mobile application </h2><br>  <i>- ... on the mobile development, I ate the dog.</i>  <i>Mark Ten, CPO <a href="http://www.sports.ru/">Sports.ru</a> .</i> <br><br>  As I said, each of the students of the course is working on their application - with varying degrees of seriousness, but still hoping to put the knowledge into practice.  I think, I will express the majority opinion, saying that I expected some kind of farewell from the main ideologist of the Mark Ten course during his lecture on monetization. <br><br>  Mark said first: <br><br>  - I did not think that all of you will endorse this lecture (a <i>great start - note by the author</i> ).  I'll start with a simple thought: "If you can not do an app, then do not do it." <br><br>  Thank you, Mark. <br><br>  With such a parting word, you could disperse, but let's be honest - sometimes a good site is really enough for a good product.  The mobile application is a tool: just as in 2010, customer requirements were reduced to a ‚Äúpage on the website‚Äù, in 2015 everyone saw a panacea in applications for mobile platforms. <br><br>  In 2016, the situation has changed a bit - now there are clever people who offer to ‚Äúsave‚Äù and ‚Äúmake a hybrid application.‚Äù  Let's agree on the shore: <b>do not make hybrid applications.</b>  As is often the case, instead of combining the advantages of platforms and sites in a hybrid, all possible disadvantages crystallize.  Interaction with the resources of mobile platforms is still not working, the flexibility of the site has already been lost.  Seriously, these days mobile internet is cheap and fast enough to get along with a cool website (no, I didn't say cheap, I said cheap enough :) <br><br><h2>  Why did aborigines eat cook? </h2><br>  The task of mobile stores (App Store and Google Play) is an outsourcing business.  The list of business functions that the platforms assume is impressive: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Design standards.</b>  Food teams in faraway California made it all up for us.  Millions of users have already made a choice in favor of this or that platform, so we just need not spoil anything. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Shopping infrastructure.</b>  And in a narrow and in a broad sense, Stores are needed to reduce the cost of the transaction.  Developers save a lot of time on processing payments in different currencies, on cross-border transfers, on settling legal subtleties.  It is only necessary to put a tick in front of the desired country. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Security.</b>  Although Google has problems with it :) Nevertheless, if you don‚Äôt get involved in local Chinese stores, most applications are completely safe for users. <br><br></li><li>  <b>RnD</b> (or, if you prefer, R &amp; D).  Both Google and Apple are investing billions of their own funds to create new features, motivating us to move forward, improve, and propose new solutions. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Software and hardware integration.</b>  Again, minus the strange Chinese stor, the platform makes considerable efforts to ensure that native applications quickly and smoothly work on their native hardware. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Distribution.</b>  Not for nothing that the site called the marketplace - the better the conditions for buyers and sellers, the more profitable to all participants in the process. </li></ul><br><h2>  Interlude in which everything is relative </h2><br>  You'd be surprised, but for the pleasure of not thinking about many aspects of the business and focusing on the development you have to pay, in the literal and figurative sense.  Here are some tips for the product manager of a mobile application: <br><br><ul><li>  Support for both platforms at once is a doubling of development resources. </li><li>  As well as design costs. </li><li>  An application as a product has an additional barrier for the user - it must first be downloaded and installed. </li><li>  Attracting new users to the application is on average more expensive than in the digital market as a whole. </li></ul><br>  Like real natives, we all live in a cargo-cult of a new version of mobile operating systems.  Each new update arrives will drop a ton of new requirements on the product manager, for which the application will definitely be replaced with non-compliance (no one will use the new products anyway). <br><br><h2>  A climax in which new heroes come on the scene </h2><br>  Everyone knows the saying about fish and the dynamics of decomposition processes.  This dynamic is such that it is time to think about what tools will replace mobile applications. <br><br>  Here they are, the heroes of the new time: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Instant apps.</b>  Applications that run in the cloud and broadcast to mobile devices.  Here is a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/18/google-takes-a-new-approach-to-native-apps-with-instant-apps-for-android/">good</a> Tech Crunch <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/18/google-takes-a-new-approach-to-native-apps-with-instant-apps-for-android/">article</a> on this topic. <br><br></li><li>  <b>New generations of browsers.</b>  The growth of browsers functionality will help them partially supplant native applications, but I can hardly believe that the future lies precisely in this format.  Google Chrome did not become a normal OS and normal replacement of applications also will not. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Messengers and new ecosystems.</b>  Only the lazy does not mean that the audience of instant messengers caught up (or is about to become equal) with the audience of social networks.  I do not argue, users spend a lot of time communicating, but messengers still do not have enough infrastructure. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Contextual interaction</b> or uberization of everything.  But with all the effectiveness of the Uber-approach, it is organically limited to a rather narrow range of applications and is not always suitable. </li></ul><br><h2>  Intermission, in which the author, guiltily smiling, sells advertising </h2><br>  The absurdity of the domestic reality lies in the fact that our consumer simultaneously wants new products and features and at the same time does not want to pay for them.  A manager who wants to earn and recoup product creation will have to choose one of three monetization options.  They differ only in the taste of tar: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Premium.</b>  Tar with taste of caviar.  You can create an application for which you will pay relatively and relatively regularly, but this is either a professional product or a mobile application for an offline product. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Free.</b>  It is necessary to make a reservation that there are no free applications;  it's just not always obvious who pays for it.  The investor can pay (application as part of a larger business ecosystem), advertiser (promotional application) or sponsor (travel companion application).  The application can also be free, but earn on advertising.  In this case, you will find a lot of hard work on the choice and interaction with the advertising network (a <i>minute of advertising for Appodeal</i> :).  In addition, advertising is not always enough, so think about the diversification of income. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Freemium</b>  By the degree of reduction in aversion, in-app purchases are divided into renewable (‚Äúneed more gold!‚Äù) And one-time purchases, as well as renewable and non-renewable subscriptions. </li></ul><br>  In continuation of the topic of mobile advertising, I have to note that Mark accomplished the feat and for the whole half an hour told us about automated targeted classroom procurement in real time by the auction method, without uttering Word-On-Letter-Pe * <s>(spoiler: * Programmatic)</s> .  He did not say, and I will not - go to any digital conference, they only talk about that. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the intermission comes to an end, and since advertising needs to be shown at the junction of user scenarios, I will say that Anton Baitsur will come out of <a href="https://www.aviasales.ru/">Aviasales</a> in the next action. <br><br><h2>  Act 5, in which Anton Baitsur tells quite clearly how to manage people who are much smarter than us </h2><br>  Probably, Anton had in mind that the product manager should constantly work with specialists who are far superior to him in his area of ‚Äã‚Äãexpertise, but it sounded as if we, having got involved in product management, did not act too wisely. <br><br>  Seriously.  It's time to add a few words about process management and the project component of the product manager's work.  Let's start with cutting off the excess: <br><br><ul><li>  The product manager should not be independently engaged in the development, design or marketing.  For this, the team has specially trained people (smarter than us). </li><li>  At the same time, the product assumes the full completeness of business decision making within its product (at least in theory). </li></ul><br>  In the first lecture, the idea was already expressed that the product manager acts as a mini-director, and his main duty is to set goals and create an effective environment for the whole team.  Indeed, you do not need to know the intricacies of developing or designing interfaces, but you have to select people again, and again, and again. <br><br>  Let's stop for a second and fix: the only practical way to measure the success of a product manager is the money earned by his product.  <b>The product manager cannot afford not to think about money</b> . <br><br><h2>  Scene one: food balancing act </h2><br>  Since the product manager‚Äôs main job is communication and organization of the process, it often looks like juggling with burning balls (on a fishing line, over an abyss, under the gun‚Äôs sight).  Do not underestimate the ability to find a balance. <br><br>  This aspect of work is described by the term product operations and includes the following elements: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>360 degree interaction.</b>  Both horizontally - with related functions, and vertically - with top management or investors.  All participants in the process constantly have questions, and all these questions flow to the product manager. <br><br></li><li> <b>Analytics and statistics.</b>  The product manager should always be aware of the dynamics of the main metrics, including because this is how he gets the opportunity to answer the questions from the previous paragraph.  And in one of the first lines on the question of how to develop the product further. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Revenue management</b> (P &amp; L, reporting and capitalization).  Two key points here are the cost-benefit ratio as an indicator of the financial efficiency of the product and capitalization, which is always difficult for IT companies.  Capitalization must be dealt with immediately and seriously in order to have an up-to-date assessment of the value of the company. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Planning.</b>  Not only grocery at the level of roadmap and feature list, but also financial.  In planning, it is important to choose a horizon so that it optimally matches the company's operating model.  The board of directors should not discuss every sneeze, but should not lose touch with reality. <br><br></li><li>  <b>SWOT.</b>  The frequency and depth of the sweeping analysis strongly depends on the maturity of the product and the approach to the analysis of the development adopted in the team.  However, at least periodically you need to pause and pay attention to your strengths and weaknesses. </li></ul><br>  Let's return to the topic of financial efficiency: remember that the positive indicator of EBIDTA, to which they like to refer, is not informative in itself.  The chosen investment policy is much more important: you can cut costs and sit in the black at the cost of squeezing a business, or you can invest in development and sit in a relative minus.  You decide (and investors), so it is important to make a plan and approach in advance.  The product manager will have to carefully study the cases of other products, because only from practice come options for market strategy and tactics. <br><br><h2>  Scene Two: product marketing </h2><br>  Another important aspect of the work of the product manager is to convey the value of his product to the maximum number of people.  It is worth remembering that marketing is a sales tool.  Yes, in the 21st century it is already possible to switch to a marketing-centric model, when interaction with the consumer and the creation of customer value is put at the forefront of everything, including development.  From this, of course, it follows that marketers must take more responsibility for the profitability of the product. <br><br>  Also on the side of the product manager are basic things like market analysis, tracking the behavior of competitors and key messaging, analytics and the launch of new features and products. <br><br><h2>  Scene three, final: the product is dead, long live the product! </h2><br>  I will say a banal thing, but products die just like everything else, in full accordance with the life cycle.  Therefore, the manager needs to be purposefully engaged in the development of new products.  This process is called - new product development. <br><br>  Basically, it consists of the following steps: <br><br><ul><li>  Generation and selection of ideas. </li><li>  Planning and prioritization. </li><li>  Formation of business requirements. </li><li>  Drawing up technical requirements. </li><li>  Technical implementation. </li><li>  Management of the so-called  "Technical debt", that is, the cumulative amount of necessary improvements. </li></ul><br>  If you break this process into functional components, you get this picture: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Methodology.</b>  Scrum, kanban, something else, choose a convenient option for you personally.  If we are not talking about a large corporation, planning should be as quick as possible, and for this it is important to describe in detail and properly decompose the tasks in the work. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Rules.</b>  The rules describe the assumptions and assumptions that the whole team works with, and it is important that the whole team accept them.  For example, the priority rule may state that during the iteration of the development no new requirements should ‚Äúfly in‚Äù. In other words, by setting the internal structure, the rules also create a protective shell for the team. <br><br></li><li>  <b>The roles of team members</b> , for example, product manager, developer, designer, marketer, bizdev, etc. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Instruments.</b>  Choose your toolbox like Jira, Wiki, Trello and more. </li></ul><br><h2>  Deus ex machina </h2><br>  Thanks to everyone who read to this place :).  It seems so far this is the longest longrid in the series.  We‚Äôve done half the way, three notes left, and the next lecture, like an antique god from a car, is sent to us by Uber data scientist Oleg Novikov, who will talk about analytics, machine learning, and what is the use of all this. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/317460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/317460/</a></p>
