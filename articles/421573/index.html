Their combination affects the perception of the product as a whole. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/104/3b7/337/1043b733726235568c8cb30aa652f660.png"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://uxplanet.org/checkbox-vs-toggle-switch-7fc6e83f10b8">Checkbox vs Toggle Switch</a> </h4><br>  Saadia Minhas examines in detail the situations in which you need to use the checkbox and toggle switch - they solve similar problems, but are not interchangeable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac7/1f2/619/ac71f2619fd8407bf6b29b148034c53a.png" width="500"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.uisources.com/">UI Sources - Mobile Design Patterns and Interactions</a> </h4><br>  Another library of patterns of mobile applications. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/redesigning-siri-and-adding-multitasking-features-to-ios-70c2f1a1569b">Redesigning Siri and adding multitasking features to iOS</a> </h4><br>  A smart concept for the development of notifications and multitasking in iOS from K√©vin Eug√®ne.

Since the days of the classic Luke Wroblewski book, little has changed, but its new edition is clearly not enough, so the article is useful.  Part 2 talks about <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/08/ux-html5-mobile-form-part-2/">handling input fields on mobile</a> . <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.data-to-viz.com/">From data to Viz - Find the graphic you need</a> </h4><br>  Smart visual reference book on how to visualize data. <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://www.netinstructions.com/amazon-dark-patterns/">Amazon Dark Patterns - Censuring Unhappy Customers</a> </h4><br>  Amazon uses a fairly hard dark pattern - in contrast to the imputed standard approach, we throw a positive assessment into the application store, a negative feedback, they simply don‚Äôt allow us to leave bad reviews (they say it was too long). <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ecommerce-compete-amazon/">6 Ways Ecommerce Sites Can Compete With Amazon</a> </h4><br>  Kim Flaherty of the Nielsen / Norman Group has identified several areas in which Amazon works poorly and makes it possible for other online stores to stand out. <br><br><h4>  Baymard Institute Studies </h4><br>  Edward Scott writes about the <a href="https://baymard.com/blog/promote-in-store-returns">importance of having an explicit way to return goods to an offline store.</a> <br><br><h3>  Design systems and guidelines </h3><br><h4>  <a href="https://medium.muz.li/differences-between-designing-native-ios-apps-and-native-android-apps-e71256dfa1ca">Differences between design apps and native apps</a> </h4><br>  SteelKiwi Inc. team  compares the implementation of typical interface tasks in Android and iOS.

Very useful analysis of the features and problems of implementation and promotion of the platform.  For example, many companies see the design system as a way to raise the basic level of product design, but typical solutions may limit designers;  therefore, they constantly make "concept cars" - experiments with interface patterns in the spirit of a single design that move the Polaris forward. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/990/44a/dda/99044adda5f69413a9591864258a6a26.png"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://medium.com/asana-design/the-key-lessons-i-learned-creating-a-popular-design-system-d078c817b4dd">The key lessons I learned creating a popular Design System</a> </h4><br>  Matt Bond recently moved to Asana, but was at the forefront of the Atlassian design system.
