Yota grows and develops.  In 2015, we implemented many interesting projects.  For example, the distribution of our SIM-cards for smartphones and tablets is already operating in 71 regions, the Yota connection in 2G / 3G / 4G networks operates throughout the country.  By the end of the 3rd quarter of 2015, our users became one and a half million.  Only from August to the end of September the number of customers increased by 50%!  Under the cut - more numbers, dates and events that are significant for us and our users. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The fastest growing operator: where we started working in 2015 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ea/a9c/598/9eaa9c598972492ab8d82c66aa859b88.jpg"><br><br>  Yota SIM cards for smartphones and tablets can now be purchased in 71 regions, and modems and routers in 66.

      We have become the most dynamically developing operator on the Russian telecom market.  From January 2015, Yota began distributing SIM cards for smartphones and tablets in 45 new regions.  The geography of launches is the most extensive, from the European part of Russia to the Far East.  We connected the whole of the Urals, made new launches in the North Caucasus, in the Siberian Federal District, touched the Volga region, the European north of Russia. <br><br>  We expanded our own retail throughout Russia, and in December we signed a contract with the digital retail network DNS.  Our products will be available in over 800 DNS stores located in 68 regions.  And by the end of 2015, taking into account partner networks, the number of points where customers can purchase Yota SIM cards has reached 12,000. <br><br><h3>  Real Unlimited 4G </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a8/a15/4bf/5a8a154bf87a473b8759529248151dab.jpg"><br><br>  In 2015, we began to provide unlimited 4G Internet in 32 new regions.  And with the launch in Kabardino-Balkaria, our unlimited 4G-Internet is now available in 66 regions of Russia. <br><br><h3>  Awards 2015 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10a/472/2d2/10a4722d27e14608b84fa367c5b5a99a.jpg"><br><br>  In 2015, we received the Runet Award in the Mobile Runet nomination for the best mobile application.  By the way, a year earlier we received the Award in the nomination "Technologies and Innovations". <br><br>  You can download the application under Android or iOS. <br><br>  In addition, the site <a href="http://www.yota.ru/">www.yota.ru</a> received an award at the All-Russian competition of sites and mobile applications "Rating Runet-2015" in the category information technology. <br><br>  But that's not all.  This year we have won a number of awards in various fields: <br><br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúBest Mobile Operator‚Äù by Hi-Tech.Mail.Ru, February 2015. </li><li>  ‚ÄúBest Practice for Online Customer Service‚Äù, Crystal Headset Award, March 2015. </li><li>  ‚ÄúCoach of the Year‚Äù, Crystal Headset Award, March 2015. </li><li>  ‚ÄúThe best back office team‚Äù (high jury approval), Crystal Headset Award, March 2015. </li><li>  "Scene of the Year" by Geometria.ru, Focus Awards 2015, March 2015. </li><li>  "Press Service of the Year" contest "Press Service of the Year 2014", April 2015. </li><li>  Entered the Top 100 Best Marketing Directors Rating by Kommersant, Misha Chernyshev, September 2015 </li><li>  Included in the rating of "Top 100 best IT directors" according to Kommersant, Sergey Volkov, September 2015. </li><li>  III place in the nomination "Website of a telecommunication company", the award "Golden Site-2015", October 2015. </li><li>  Winner in the nomination "Mobile Runet", "Runet Award 2015", November 2015. </li><li>  Winner in the nomination "The best project for the promotion of innovation," the award "Innovation Time - 2015", December 2015. </li></ul><br><h3>  Yota for the future: platform Yota FutureProof </h3><br>  In 2015, Yota launched a new experimental platform Yota FutureProof (‚ÄúYota for the Future‚Äù).  Our goal is to openly test innovative technologies in real conditions and evaluate their effectiveness for business.  All the data obtained and the results of experiments are in the public domain and anyone who wishes can familiarize themselves with them and understand whether it is advisable for him to use this or that technology in business. <br><br>  The results of the first mass non-standard project were published by us.  The statistics reflect various indicators - capital expenditures, man-hour costs, electricity costs, etc.  - reflecting the effectiveness of the tested technologies in business processes.  While data is available for one of the experiments, but any user can indicate their contact details on the site in order to receive notification of the launch of the next project. <br><br><h3>  Building a network of gas stations for electric vehicles and a SIM card for Tesla cars </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fdf/776/3af/fdf7763af52942919501dbca4c430e4f.jpg"><br><br>  In fact, our series of innovative experiments began with a joint project organized with Revolta Motors.  In February 2015, we took part in the construction of a network of filling stations for electric cars EMP - the name stands for ‚ÄúElectric Mobile Infrastructure‚Äù. <br><br>  Yota provides users with charging points free "refueling" for up to a year.  This is not our only contribution to the development of the innovative electric vehicle industry.  We also provided electric cars imported by Revolta Motors with unlimited internet.  This is especially important for Tesla electric vehicles, which can be compared with smartphones on wheels: software updates and diagnostics are performed exclusively remotely via the Internet.  Therefore, unlimited mobile Internet for Tesla is vital. <br><br>  Of course, owners of any electric vehicles can use charging points, and in the first year it will be possible to charge the batteries of their cars for free. <br><br><h3>  The world's first delivery of SIM-cards by drones </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44d/12f/0ff/44d12f0ff01b4f6ba744a289d5731807.jpg"><br><br>  In September of this year, delivery by drones was the first mass experimental project in the framework of the Yota FutureProof.  The experiment on the delivery of SIM cards by drones started on September 2 at four points in Moscow: on the territory of the Strelka Institute, in the Museon and Sokolniki parks, and also in the Pavilion of the Polytechnic Museum at the Exhibition of Economic Achievements.  The goal of the experiment # yota delivers to honestly and openly test in real conditions an unusual way of delivery and share the results with startups, young scientists and creators of projects in the field of IT. <br><br><ul><li>  In just one month, 964 SIM cards were delivered. </li><li>  The total distance that the drones have flown is more than 578 km.  This is approximately equal to the distance from Moscow to Voronezh. </li><li>  The price of one air delivery in Moscow was 488.5 rubles, which is slightly lower than the average cost of delivery by courier (from 500 rubles within the Moscow Ring Road). </li><li>  The total charging time for quadcopter batteries exceeded 96 hours, it took 6.5 kW of electricity. </li><li>  Each flight of the drone cost 4 kopecks. </li><li>  The average delivery time for a quadcopter was 90 seconds. </li></ul><br>  According to the results of the experiment, we concluded that delivery by quadrocopters can now be used as an alternative distribution channel for goods.  But the project will be as effective as possible for those types of businesses where it is possible to eliminate the work of personnel at the points, which will save about a third of the budget and reduce the cost of delivery.  The project, on average, pays off in 5-6 months. <br><br>  Experiment with drones was appreciated not only by clients, but also by experts.  Yota became one of the winners of the 2015 Innovation Time award. <br><br><h3>  Updated Yota Many Router </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd6/d1c/526/bd6d1c52674245ac844aba0b927260ee.jpg"><br><br>  We started sales of the updated Yota Many router, which has a higher speed of receiving and transmitting data, as well as a more stable connection.  In intensive use mode, the router works without recharging for more than 12 hours, and the standby time is 60 hours.  The updated Yota Many model charges in just one hour from 0 to 70% - twice as fast as the previous model. <br><br>  Mobile router Yota Many still allows you to connect up to eight devices, works in two modes (via USB or WiFi), suitable for smartphones, tablets, readers, laptops, personal computers, TVs, gaming consoles.  Yota micro-SIM cards are already installed in the routers.  Yota Many is compatible with Windows, Mac OS, Linux and other operating systems. <br><br><h3>  Total cost control in roaming </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ff/a64/1a8/8ffa641a8ae7409abcd8c2f377fd0874.jpg"><br><br>  On the eve of the New Year holidays, we presented an updated offer for international roaming.  Now roaming in Yota is available in 229 countries of the world. <br>  The main advantages of the updated offer: <br><br><ul><li>  Full cost control in roaming in real time. </li><li>  Services do not need to be connected additionally. </li><li>  The Internet is paid on the principle of 20 MB pomegabyte and 20 MB as a gift. </li><li>  Half an hour incoming for 39 rubles per day. </li></ul><br>  In 55 countries of Europe and the CIS, customers who already use package offers will pay up to 20 MB of Internet traffic per megabyte, and upon reaching this volume, they will receive another 20 MB as a gift.  Half an hour of incoming calls in roaming around the world will cost 39 rubles per day.  The cost of outgoing calls - from 19 rubles per minute. <br><br>  The traffic of the installed Yota mobile application and the mobile version of the site, as well as customer service, including SMS support at 0999, chat in the mobile application and on the yota.ru website, remain free abroad.  The service works even with a zero balance. <br><br>  From December 23, 2015 to January 2, 2016, Yota gives travelers a New Year present - all our users traveling to 48 popular countries will receive the first 40 MB of traffic for free.  More information about the conditions of the action and the list of countries can be found on the website yota.ru. <br><br>  This year was not easy in many respects, but looking back we see how productive it was in the end.  We do not stop at what has been achieved and in 2016 we will strive for new heights - as a service, in the coverage of new regions, in experiments and innovations.  Ahead of us (and you - as our users) is waiting for both new geography of communication and communication, and new products.  A lot of things will be new, follow our publications.  Happy New Year! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/274375/">https://habr.com/ru/post/274375/</a></p>
