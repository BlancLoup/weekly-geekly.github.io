  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet users classification for advertiser</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Internets are the most dynamically developing communication medium, which haburiers know better than others.  Advertising on the Internet is trying to keep up with services and technologies.  Youtube, Odnoklassniki.ru, Twitter, ... tomorrow another site will appear that will change the approach to online communications.  Everything is constantly changing, and if you do not closely follow Internet advertising, now I will quickly talk about the current realities. <br><br>  Today there are six types of the most common Internet users.  Each of them the advertiser must know in person, to understand exactly how to sell his product. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  <b>1. User is random.</b>  Goes online once a month to check email, because  He received a call saying ‚ÄúI sent you a document.‚Äù  In addition to mail, almost does not use anything.  Fortunately, there are already such on the Internet - an overwhelming minority (less than 10% of users access the Internet less than once a week). </blockquote>  This friend is not interesting to the advertiser.  But if you suddenly need it - catch it in the mail. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>2. User newbie.</b>  The Internet began to be used regularly not so long ago, although his neighbor registered a mailbox 4 years ago.  Runs on all sites in a row in search of interesting.  In the "chosen" less than two dozen links.  He tries to remember all the time on which site he saw ‚Äúsuch a cool thing‚Äù yesterday (he doesn‚Äôt know about the existence of the histori).  He sees all the jokes and funny pictures for the first time.  Has not yet been on the bash. </blockquote>  We catch on coverage and navigation resources: search, portals, news.  The patient still willingly presses on banners, use it.

    <blockquote>  <b>3. The user is experienced, office.</b>  He knows that where on the Internet lies.  Leads blozhek.  It has a couple of profiles in the social.  networks.  Visits three professional resources.  Checks four mailboxes.  Exchange rates, weather forecast, traffic jams and city news learns from the Internet.  I repeatedly made small purchases online (books, CDs, movie tickets, pizza) and at least once bought something from electronics or home appliances (mobile phone / laptop / fotik / refrigerator / TV / washer) from an online store.  The main motive of purchase is cheaper on the Internet.  There are already so many sites in the ‚Äúelected‚Äù that it is not realistic to find something there.  But he already has at least 50 addresses from memory.  Spends online more than 3 hours a day. </blockquote>  Advertiser‚Äôs dream.  But he will have to be courted from all sides.  Show ads on the search.  Tell us about the product with the help of a banner on the service sites (you will not be interested in it with a regular banner, offer a promotional discount).  Let him read the news about your brand.  Slip a review of the product into the blog of his friend. <br><br>  The advertiser must work hard, the advertising budget must be large, but the efforts and investments will pay off.  After all, you work with the category of people for whom the Internet has become more important than newspapers and television. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>4. User experienced, busy.</b>  Reads only business or professional news.  It is grazed only on a couple of three specialized sites: it can be anything - from stock quotes to the forum of its auto club or recipes.  But if necessary, can quickly find information on any topic.  Spends 20 minutes on the Internet, but comes online every day.  Occasionally, she goes online for a binge - for 5-7 hours.  Makes a variety of purchases online, the motive is saving time. </blockquote>  The most difficult type of users for the advertiser.  In general, it is recommended to catch in the mail and search.  In private, rely on bundled placements that cover niche sites.  For them, write short texts, make concise, really good offers. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>5. User Odnoklassniki.ru.</b>  Age on average slightly over thirty.  With a probability of a little less than half, it can be argued that the address odnoklassniki.ru is one of the top ten of those that he himself typed in the address bar of the browser, and not through a search engine.  At first, I went to make sure that Kolya was getting sick, and Natasha was getting fat.  Then he added his photos.  And then I got used and stayed.  It comes on average a couple of times a week.  "Classmates" and favorite search engine share the first place among the most visited sites.  Moreover, with a large margin from the rest. </blockquote>  The patient lives in Odnoklassniki.  We'll have to bring it out of the trance state to attract to your site.  The easiest way is with a banner.  But the banner should cling.  Take pity, pay for a good creative.  And one more <a href="">thing</a> : take the <a href="">top banner (728x90) or InterTelek</a> .  240x400 I do not recommend - this is a difficult case.  Do not forget to put a small contact frequency.  Of course, use all the necessary targeting.  Hope for the best. <br><br>  No money on the banner?  I suggest: at the bottom of every Odnoklassniki page, a block of advertising context is spinning, there are different operators in the host.  You can get through <a href="http://direct.yandex.ru/">Yandex.Direct</a> and through <a href="http://adwords.com/">Google adWords</a> .  The number of transitions is unlikely to be large, and pay for it poklikovo. <br><br>  Working with groups / communities on Odnoklassniki makes sense only in rare cases.  They are mostly organized stupidly, so the exhaust will be small. <br><br>  Yes, I almost forgot.  On Odnoklassniki there is retargeting.  This is such a thing that shows people a banner on the basis of their previous requests to search engines and visiting thematic sites.  I was looking for a fridge in Yandex yesterday?  You will now have another week to look at the banner with refrigerators in Odnoklassniki.  Retargeting is <a href="http://www.soloway.ru/sites/odnoklassniki/">more expensive</a> than a regular banner, but it also works much better. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>6. User "In Contact".</b>  He is twenty years old.  Or twenty one.  He is a student.  Or working as a waiter in a bar where there is Wi-Fi.  Added as a friend all his classmates and removed from friends a guy / girl with whom he had quarreled the day before.  He does not use mail, he writes in a personal VKontakte.  It also communicates in groups and plays in the "farmer".  In the external Internet is guided with difficulty. </blockquote>  Companies selling chocolates, beer, snacks, cosmetics, perfumes and clothing know better than others how hard it is to fight for this tasty audience.  Banners "In Contact" <a href="http://vkontakte.ru/help.php%3Fpage%3Dbanner">are not very well located</a> , and the size is not the most delicious.  But if you need to quickly get coverage, it will fit.  Here, too, do not forget about the frequency of contact. <br><br>  Interested in advanced and effective communication?  Then go to the application.  More than a dozen of them have more than 1 million registered users, the leaders - under 8 million people.  How it works: advertising is embedded in the application and users actively communicate with it in a playful way: for example, <a href="http://ace.kiev.ua/twix-vkontakte/">branded cocktails</a> , named after your product, <a href="http://ace.kiev.ua/twix-vkontakte/">are sent to each other</a> .  The effectiveness of such communication is much higher than that of ordinary advertising.  Coverage - 2 million people.  per day.  Recommend. <br><br>  Another "In Contact" group is sensibly arranged.  You can create + pump your own group and / or write messages to strangers.  The main thing is that your content is interesting, not advertising.  If you do it correctly - you can get a loyal audience and transitions to your site. <br><br>  Contextual advertising "in contact" is specific - you must leave the user within this site.  So you have to advertise your group, app or ad.  It is recommended to use only in conjunction with other activities within "In Contact". <br><br>  <b>Depending on what kind of fish you are going to catch, take different tackle and bait.</b>  <b>So with advertising.</b>  <b>Different target groups go to <s>different depths of</s> different sites, individually react to the texts of advertising messages, etc.</b>  <b>To make the advertising campaign successful, you need to prepare well for it, and not just hang a banner on your CEO‚Äôs favorite site.</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  Good reach and many clicks :) <br><br>  <i>PS Any additions and comments to the classification and the entire text are welcome.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82168/</a></p>
