  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fukami, part 1.1: We bring the scene to the theme of the project</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d6d/24c/7af/d6d24c7af4a580f8a14875c9fd119082.jpg"><br><br>  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/198532/">last article</a> , the concept of a ‚Äúgenetically modified organism‚Äù was presented, but the scene was not used according to the theme.  In this article I want to tell how and with the help of what tools the art scene was remade.  The main changes are as follows: <br><ul><li>  Urban theme, buildings and a flying saucer are replaced by plants, views of the plant landscape;  replaced the background (sky). </li><li>  Added experimental cloud sprites (those that are striped on the KDPV above) </li><li>  The main camera mode is changed to perspective (3D);  Background sprites are scattered along the Z axis to replace the script parallax with an honest 3D perspective. </li><li>  Clouds and fog animations are redone </li><li>  The plant's core sprite has been replaced by a more technological hexagonal sprite. </li><li>  The animation of the player‚Äôs avatar and the breakdown of its parts by the Z-coordinate has been reworked. </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Instruments </h4><br>  The main workstation is a PC with Ubuntu 13.10 OS.  To work on graphics, GIMP and Inkscape are used in conjunction with the Wacom Bamboo Pen &amp; Touch graphics tablet.  In Ubuntu, there is Wacom support out of the box, though you have to configure the buttons through the console ( <a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/maverick/man1/xsetwacom.1.html">there are</a> online <a href="http://linuxwacom.sourceforge.net/index_old.php/howto/xsetwacom">instructions</a> , so no problem). <br>  Also, based on Ubuntu, it is planned to adjust work with sound and video.  In particular, for recording video for this article, the program <a href="http://recordmydesktop.sourceforge.net/about.php">Record My Desktop was used</a> , which is included in the Ubuntu repository.  The sound for the last demo was written from a stereo mixer using Audacity.  Video in OGV format and recorded sound reduced in the OpenShot Video Editor.  Exported video to OGG Theora format, because  The mentioned editor for some reason refused to see the libx264 installed on the system.  But OGG Theora is accepted by Youtube without any problems. <br>  To work with Unity3D, so far (I hope so far) have to use a station with Windows (laptop).  I tried to run the editor under Wine according to the instructions from Ask Ubuntu - it did not start (it was not possible to initialize the license service). <br>  Ubuntu One (Canonical cloud storage, if anyone does not know) is used to exchange data between workstations.  BtSync, apparently due to problems with the firewall, did not start right away (there is no time to figure it out yet).  Perhaps go to him in the future.

      Ubuntu One has created a directory with demo builds.  If anyone is interested, send email addresses registered in Ubuntu One, I will send an invite to this directory in response.  There I will try to lay out the assembly at least for Windows and Linux.  I can't test on a Mac, but on Android I will try in the future. <br><br><h5>  Inkscape </h5><br>  I'll start, perhaps, with the way I redraw the sprite core.  Used for this so-called method " <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB">Draloskopirovaniya</a> ."  A certain figure of origami is taken as a model (like <a href="http://beadorigami.blogspot.ru/2011/03/origami-interlude-egg.html">these</a> ) and imported into a vector pattern as a substrate. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a2e/a0a/c21/a2ea0ac21e66c6b7a8d5da7b11f7783d.png"><br><br>  On the substrate is created a draft of the vector skeleton (wireframe).  Immediately turn on the magnetization of input nodes to existing ones, so that the contours are closed, because  then we will need to fill them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/03f/924/641/03f92464114595f01640006d712a5cd1.png"><br><br>  If spatial thinking skills are developed, then you no longer need a sample.  You can correct the location of nodes and go to fill the closed contours. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ce1JLlHTdjI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhg911NIuFvxT5Jm3a_CbPvjcEC07A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The fill tool (Fill bounded area) was used.  It fills the polygon with the selected color (in this case, 70% gray) and adds a slightly darker border at the border between the fill and the border of the polygon.  Fill polygons at the same screen scale, because  The thickness of the edging of the fill depends on the scale.  The brightness of the selected polygon fill is conveniently controlled by the transparency of the fill (right click on fill -&gt; Fill and Strokes -&gt; Fill tab). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f2/e81/a48/9f2e81a4841078c7b08a94c25b69c7ef.png"><br><br>  Inkscape has also been used to create a satin sprite atlas.  First, the scene was drawn: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d84/fd8/95a/d84fd895a2e000cbd836c5b9b548a671.png"><br>  Then parts of it were scattered along the canvas and exported to PNG. <br><br>  For experimental clouds with a striped fill, we used the Objects to Pattern tool in Inkscape. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/quwHOljmTSw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgimE-eCjtpr7jU1Kei36G66FReOw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  To create a border of trees for the background landscape, I used the Outset tool in Inkscape. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q-jJlq8Fi3Y%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh6gOf4hGT6KrdJNe_yQOQhVhf6tA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Honest 3D perspective </h4><br>  Script parallax, implemented in Unity3d 2D demo project, uses scaling to emulate the removal of an object from the camera.  This is an extra computational load.  Therefore, it was decided to abandon it and simply spread the background layers along the Z-axis.  By changing the main camera mode from orthogonal to perspective, I received an honest parallax for the background layers and a side effect for avatar sprites and rockets.  In the demo project from Unity3D, parts of the avatar body and rockets have already been spaced apart along the Z-axis.  In orthogonal camera mode this was not visible.  Also, the entire animation of the character, NPC and rockets is also tied to the Z-coordinates of the parts.  It was necessary to forward everything by replacing by zero the Z-coordinates in the animation frames.  The structure of the resulting scene is shown in the animation below. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1a8/b83/f55/1a8b83f55cbeff84cc58ec7e94c4ff35.gif"><br>  In the foreground are blue platforms with mushrooms (Sorting Layer: Foreground in the Sprite Renderer component).  Below the Foreground layer is the Character layer, which contains the avatar itself, our GMO with other plants, the earth, and also bushes floating in the background.  SpriteRenderer to determine which sprite to place on top of which one is guided by the ones specified in the Sorting Layer and Order in Layer parameters.  Accordingly, sprites with a larger value Z-coordinates can still be drawn on top of other sprites.  Be careful with the selection of Sorting Layer and Order in Layer. <br>  So in our scene, if in the Sprite Renderer of background bushes you specify Order in Layer more than one or change Sorting Layer to Foreground, the bushes will be drawn over the ground, avatar and vegetation, even though they are farther from the camera. <br><br>  A view for assessing the perspective is presented below <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFoF_DA556A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgi6gXtxldyx9uxv00vhriCOWYpHA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  What's next? </h4><br>  The work, of course, is still a car and many many small carts.  I will highlight a couple of immediate priorities. <br><ul><li>  Of course, instead of draft sprites of vegetation, you need to draw something more decent, more creative. </li><li>  Add insect sprites exotic appearance. </li><li>  Cook finally a more appropriate soundtrack. </li><li>  Alter genetics so that you can ‚Äúshoot the genes‚Äù wherever you want. </li><li>  Implement objects attaching to the skeleton of the plant - walls, supports, shooters, bullets, and what else will come to mind. </li><li>  To realize the sun radiating heat and radiation;  realize clouds that give water and electricity. </li><li>  Implement a UI showing accumulated resources and available genes. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  P.S </h4><br>  After the first article about the project I was contacted by two developers.  Therefore, another important task is to adjust the processes so that it is comfortable to work in your free time.  As I wrote above, for the exchange of data is used while Ubuntu One.  Communication via Skype.  Task tracker is not selected yet.  This and the formation of the tasks themselves will probably be done in the near future.  When will the next update on the project I can not say. <br><br>  I hope someone my experience will be useful.  I will share as far as possible. <br><br>  THANKS FOR ATTENTION! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207108/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207108/</a></p>
