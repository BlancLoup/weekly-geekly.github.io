As an introduction, I will say that now I have a lot of free time and sadness in my heart from meeting with clients and their absolutely identical problems.  Further, about the problems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <b>Start</b> </h5><br>  So, imagine yourself in the role of a newly-released marketer who has received the road to life in a small (or medium-sized) enterprise.  What does he know?  He knows that Kotler created marketing.  He is confident that marketing can help any business. <br><br>  Yes, this young specialist is absolutely right.  But the trouble is that everything he knows is no longer working!  All these mailings, offers, perseverance, reminders now do not give a guarantee of increased sales. <br><br>  So what should he do?  After all, the authorities will demand, crush, complain that the money flies into the pipe, but there is no result.  The answer is quite simple: go to the other side.

      What I mean.  Imagine your morning: you came to work, turned on the computer, downloaded the mail, looked at everything that came to you, and ... And here it is true: you looked at everything, but nothing interested you. <br><br>  Everything you see in your email is the same.  All these calls to action, serious and pompous phrases, product reviews, discounts and promotions.  You just get sick of them. <br><br><h5>  <b>Idea</b> </h5><br>  And I suggest you look at it through the eyes of an ordinary buyer, the one you are looking for.  What does he know about you, about your company?  Why it does not merge into one spot with competitors?  What is your proposal may be beneficial to him? <br><br>  Consider how much information now goes to our brain.  Only a few decades ago, its number was several times smaller, and now we are all mobile, global, and available in every second of life.  So how do we take on this background, the next information hype? <br><br>  The correct approach to the problem of marketing in our country (and not only in it, to be honest) is the question of interaction with the modern client.  With the client who brought up this information noise, which successfully maneuvers in it and searches for the necessary information in it. <br><br>  Become the same as this client - adjust your offer to it, find a common language and you will receive it in your pool.  How to do it? <br><br><h5>  <b>Decision</b> </h5><br>  Start small, at the same time - from the most difficult, learn how to use a CRM system.  Anyone you like.  You can see the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/users/itimora/topics/">article</a> @itimora, I really liked it. <br><br>  I will not advertise to you modern platforms of CRM-systems, read about them yourself, or ask advice from a friend who has already installed it and started using it.  The main thing - start now! <br><br>  If you correctly build the process of processing leads (contacts of any kind with potential customers), after a relatively short period of time you will be able to get amazing data: data about who is interested in you now. <br><br>  And this will give you the opportunity to work on the attractiveness of your product for this audience.  Just imagine: you suddenly found out that your clients (even if they are just leads) are all under the age of 25!  And maybe they are still all - female, and besides - only housewives!  How much easier will you make an offer now? <br><br>  This is just one of the advantages of working with a CRM system, there are others: reports on clients, information on previous transactions, contacts, debts.  In addition, it is a great subject for monitoring the work of subordinates! <br><br>  Returning to the topic of customer orientation, we note that customer knowledge, knowledge of customer information is the key to successful marketer work in your company.  So hurry to find out who your customer is!  This will relieve you of the need for fortune telling on coffee grounds, tea leaves and paraffin candles.  In addition - it will save your money. <br><br><h5>  <b>The board</b> </h5><br>  Advice to a novice specialist: if you come to work in a company that does not have a CRM system, there are no means of collecting customer information, but there are persistent demands to make an urgent new marketing plan - quit!  Do not waste your life on nonsense, save your nerve cells. <br><br>  Council to a professional marketer: share with me your vision of modern marketing in my country and I will give you a couple of bottles of beer! <br><br><h5>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h5><br>  So why are you all (or all of us) doing this?  Why do we copy the pages of textbooks and books, listen to lectures of prominent experts and try to repeat the successes of others? <br><br>  Do not try to invent something that already exists.  Any client will be yours as soon as you find the words he needs and say them at the right time.  You just need to find this time and this client for these words. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289540/</a></p>
