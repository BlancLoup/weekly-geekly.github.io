The missed emulator will be added to the main material. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The principle of work with the console emulator </h3><br>  The game console emulator is a software shell that emulates the operation of the hardware of the device itself.  Developing an emulator is not so easy - you need both programming experience and knowledge of accurate information about the principles of operation of the original device.  Most emulators can be divided into two groups, including ‚Äúsimple‚Äù and ‚Äúcomposite‚Äù programs.  Many emulators provide even more functionality than old consoles (for example, saving in games for Dendy and Sega).
