  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Black Friday is already this week: where to watch the best prices of the year on gadgets</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you know the feeling of resentment when you find out about the discount on your dream gadget only when they are all sold out, you can begin to sulk: although there are still four days before Black Friday itself, sales in US stores are already going and virtual shelves are rapidly becoming empty.  However, new offers come every day, so if you have been looking at a gadget for a long time, this week is the best time of the year to re-search the Internet for tasty discounts.  Unlike the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/282368/">Chinese with AliExpress</a> , Americans in pricing, as a rule, are much more decent - and discounts on popular products are quite real.  Another thing is that really impressive offers appear rarely and end quickly, so shopping on Black Friday week is almost a sport, not a household chore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a8/281/7ca/2a82817caceb488d9fb6800b48858b2b.jpg"><br>  <i>Since childhood, we have been taught that there will not be enough chairs for everyone.</i> <br><br>  In this review: discounts on Amazon, eBay, Bestbuy, on Microsoft, Apple, Samsung, and others. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Amazon extended black friday to christmas </h2><br>  Amazon‚Äôs Black Friday started last Monday and will not end another month: last week the company <a href="http://www.techradar.com/news/score-you-can-keep-saving-on-amazon-long-after-black-friday">announced</a> that new discounts would appear <a href="https://www.amazon.com/b%3Ftag%3Dgeoriot-trd-20%26ie%3DUTF8%26node%3D384082011%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-1916224446-20%26nocache%3D1479696385093">on the site</a> every five minutes right up to December 22.

      For example, you can take the Xbox One 500GB for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0118GJKIW/ref%3Dasc_df_B0118GJKIW4645272/%3Ftag%3Dhawk-future-20%26creative%3D394997%26creativeASIN%3DB0118GJKIW%26linkCode%3Ddf0%26ascsubtag%3Dhawk-475036426-20">$ 253.45</a> ($ 46 discount).  And in Gamestop for another $ 54 cheaper, you can get the same Xbox <a href="http://www.gamestop.com/xbox-one/consoles/xbox-one-500gb-console/115705">second-hand with a guarantee</a> - the only difficulty will be, as it turned out, blocked access to the site from Russian IP.  However, it‚Äôs not for me to explain to you how to deceive the regional blocking of <s>Roskomnadzor</s> . <br><br><h2>  Minus 400 on Surface tablets and other interesting Microsoft offers </h2><br>  Microsoft in recent years has been quite interesting, but damn expensive iron.  The ruble exchange rate does not make life easier, so only discounts can sweeten the aluminum pill: from November 24 to November 28, the Surface Pro 4 tablet and the Surface Book transformer will be sold with decent discounts: You can get Surface Pro 4 with a free Type cover from Thursday, saving $ 430, and the Surface Book will fall in price from $ 1,899 to $ 1,499. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/153223145" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The entire range of discounts can be viewed <a href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/cat/Black-Friday-Sale/categoryID.67001100%3Ficid%3Dtopstripe_BlackFridayPreview_SW">on the MS website</a> . <br><br>  In addition, the sale applies to iron and other manufacturers: from the modest hundreds of other bucks, pinned from the price tags on laptops Asus, Lenovo, etc.  up to a completely <a href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Alienware-15-Touch-Signature-Edition-Gaming-Laptop/productID.332771400%3Ficid%3Dgm_17hol_bfpre_modF_DellAlienware15">horseback $ 1002</a> on the game monster Dell Alienware (really nobody wants to buy it that way?) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8b1/243/ebe/8b1243ebe3bcc4e541b146dc83ef8b96.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Under the terms of the promotion, prices are valid only in the United States;  but, from the experience of Pochtoy.com, problems with accepting Russian cards for payment usually do not arise - the main thing is to have <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/tariffs/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">an American delivery address</a> . <br><br>  In more difficult situations, when the opportunity to pay with a non-American card is banned, the system can be deceived using the <a href="http://pochtoy.com/page/tariffs/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">Full Support</a> service: this will add $ 79.92 to the cost of Surface Pro 4, including shipping, and even cheaper to buy and deliver Surface Book - $ 74 95  And another five bucks will be cheaper if you use the coupon supergeek. <br><br>  Another way to save on Microsoft products without reference to a specific date is to glance at their offers on <a href="https://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/list/categoryID.69403300%3Ficid%3DResources_All_Categories_Refurb">restored gadgets</a> . <br><br><h2>  Discounts for Apple products </h2><br>  Unlike Microsoft, Apple usually arrogantly ignores Black Friday, because  In general, they do not suffer from the lack of demand for their products at any time of the year.  Therefore, interesting offers can be found, but only in third-party stores.  For example, that week the iPad Pro 9.7 "could be found for $ 450 at Target, but now you can still order the gold iPad Pro 9.7" 32 GB <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-details.asp%3FEdpNo%3D9969794%26SRCCODE%3D3WCJ%26utm_source%3Dcj%26utm_content%3D6361382%26utm_term%3D12612265">for $ 514</a> - still $ 85 <a href="http://www.apple.com/shop/buy-ipad/ipad-pro/9.7-inch-display-32gb-gold-wifi">cheaper</a> than the Apple Store. <br><br>  And at Bestbuy, you can still buy the latest MacBook Pro 13.3 " <a href="">for $ 1,649.99</a> instead of the regular price of $ 1,799.99. <br><br><h2>  Discounts at BestBuy </h2><br>  In general, Bestbuy.com fully justifies its name.  Unfortunately, some <a href="https://www.cnet.com/pictures/black-friday-top-pc-deals-2016/7/">of the best deals</a> on Apple‚Äôs products at Bestbuy have already expired, but they continue to add others - and they are worth <a href="">a little digging there</a> . <br><br>  For example, the eight-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab A 16GB fell by as much as a third, <a href="">from $ 200 to $ 130</a> , which is exactly half the price they ask for in Russian stores. <br><br>  There you can find a lot of discounts on TVs with a large diagonal of <a href="">up to $ 300-500</a> .  However, ordering TVs larger than 32 "from overseas is not recommended due to the high risk of damage on the way. The chances that a large and heavy box can be dropped on the way are too large, so when ordering TVs in the US, be sure to take into account the dimensions of the TV in the box: It is best to focus on the ‚ÄúMail Express‚Äù limits 120 * 80 * 50 cm or the sum of the length and perimeter up to 300 cm according to USPS / EMS standards. <br><br>  Another spoon of tar in this barrel of honey will be that it is one of the most ‚Äúharmful‚Äù stores, which is fundamentally and systematically struggling with purchases from abroad - at least from Russia for sure - and bans mailforwarders.  Therefore, to purchase from there, Pochtoy.com advises using <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/OfficialBestBuy">their store on eBay</a> .  The worst case scenario here is that the purchase will be canceled a few hours later by the store, and the money returned to the buyer. <br><br><h2>  EBay Discounts </h2><br>  It is on eBay that the black-fledged discounts <a href="http://deals.ebay.com/">in the Deals section</a> achieve absolutely crazy values.  For about $ 500, you can take either the <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Apple-Macbook-Pro-13-3-2-5-GHz-Core-i5-500GB-HDD-4GB-DDR3L-RAM-MD101LL-A-/152252667419%3Frpp_cat_id%3D5000006407">MacBook, which has fallen in price by 54%</a> (rebuilt, there are no miracles, not Apple prices), or a brand new Dell with a 12.5 "touchscreen <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Dell-12-5-Full-HD-2in1-Touchscreen-Laptop-Intel-Core-m5-6Y54-8GB-RAM-128GB-SSD-/391620778777%3Frpp_cat_id%3D5000006407">with a discount of 41%</a> - Amazon and other <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/Apple-Macbook-Pro-13-3-2-5-GHz-Core-i5-500GB-HDD-4GB-DDR3L-RAM-MD101LL-A-/152252667419%3Frpp_cat_id%3D5000006407">companies</a> have similar offers sellers, but eBay beats at the price of them all, and the seller, the Adorama chain of stores, offers this laptop on eBay for $ 70 cheaper than <a href="http://www.adorama.com/dexps827wlan.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKEAiAsMXBBRD71KWOh6fcjRwSJAC5CNE19Yb_jEoza43qGNrAJFMLdWKQ1Q49-LT2IN7BU5RUWBoCol_w_wcB">on its own website</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01f/6cd/068/01f6cd068996a3ee907746c12a24cfab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The main thing, when it comes to the restored technology on eBay, to pay attention, the factory is a restoration (factory refurbished) or by the seller itself (seller refurbished).  In the latter case, you need to carefully look at its rating, reviews and description of the status of the restored device (Seller Notes).  Scratched iPhone 6 from a reliable seller at a price three times lower than the store one is still a rather interesting offer. <br><br><h2>  Falcon hunting </h2><br>  And finally, a small life hack: to study the price tags in the stores was more convenient, you can use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pricehawk/cohhgdekcfplcdndaogaohppedaicpej">the Techradar</a> developer‚Äôs Pricehawk <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pricehawk/cohhgdekcfplcdndaogaohppedaicpej">extension for Chrome</a> , which not only looks for the best prices for the product you are currently watching, but also informs promo codes that are known to it.  The first experience of use already shows that Pricehawk works more precisely with the <a href="https://sovetnik.yandex.ru/">Yandex Market Advisor</a> , which has an unpleasant habit instead of the lowest price, say, on the phone, indicating the lowest price for a case for it. <br><br>  <b>Deliver parcels by mail:</b> <br><br> <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/91a/388/404/91a3884042444f849c2fec2aa3d4cbce.png"></a> <br><br>  By tradition - a discount of $ 5 on the first order of delivery of <a href="http://pochtoy.com/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dgeeks16">Pochtoy</a> from the USA for all who read up to this place on the <b>supergeek</b> promotion code. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399255/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399255/</a></p>
