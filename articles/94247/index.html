It is three o'clock in the morning, I have to get up in 3-4 hours, but the words are asked to the file so that I had to plug it into the laptop. <br>  I want to hold an exhibition of Gadzhetov in Moscow or St. Petersburg, which are not yet available on the Russian market.  Experience in organizing events is available.  Why, why and how - under the cut. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/94247/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f28/6a9/b07/f286a9b07285652a6a2b461d18aca6da.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  UPD - added links to options for exhibits.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  UPD: <br><br>  What exactly to exhibit - it would be good to discuss here.  I intend to expose smart furniture, robots and small futuristic things, like these: <br><br><img src="http://www.japangadgetshop.com/product_images/j/4__11904.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fbb/4de/5d8/fbb4de5d88d6298e38bdecaa7f1f9a0f.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/179/64c/a2e/17964ca2e05ce05c6e86e31034758ddf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.tokyoflash.com/en/watches/pimp/p2pusher/">www.tokyoflash.com/en/watches/pimp/p2pusher</a> (I recommend to <a href="http://www.tokyoflash.com/en/watches/pimp/p2pusher/">go</a> shopping) <br>  <a href="http://www.japangadgetshop.com/products/Humping-Dog-USB.html">www.japangadgetshop.com/products/Humping-Dog-USB.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.japangadgetshop.com/products/Choken-Bako-">www.japangadgetshop.com/products/Choken-Bako-</a> ‚Äì-Bank-Dog.html <br>  <a href="http://www.japangadgetshop.com/products/Flying-Cockroach-RC-%25252d-Taiyo.html">www.japangadgetshop.com/products/Flying-Cockroach-RC-%252d-Taiyo.html</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.japangadgetshop.com/products/H.Concept-Caomaru-4-faces.html">www.japangadgetshop.com/products/H.Concept-Caomaru-4-faces.html</a> <br><br>  - And now - the background: <br><br>  Now I want to tell you about a project that has finally become clear to me and that is starting right now.  He has every chance of getting me completely.  I want to go straight to the point, but without prehistory it will be incomprehensible.  Be patient a bit, okay?  I will try not to chew rubber :) <br><br>  Prehistory  I have long tried to earn a lot of money and do nothing :) I created a <a href="http://www.web-mark.ru/">design studio</a> , it still works successfully, but I left it, leaving the share to my partner.  Then he worked in <a href="http://www.intecco.ru/">another studio as an</a> art director and left, realizing that we promise to give business tools, but we are doing just cool websites (some of them have worked their price in full, but this is not about that).  In general, I have nothing to be ashamed of, but I have not invested myself in any project, but I really want to. <br><br>  Stage 2. A few months ago, my friend suggested: ‚ÄúWan, think up a good project, and I will invest.  From your idea and design, from me - the money and the proportion of 30%. "  My girlfriend threw the idea, I finished it and we agreed with the investor.  But I got scared.  I was not ready to vouch for that online service project. <br><br>  Stage 3. Time passed, I decided to make an online store of Japanese gadgets under the same conditions.  The target audience is you :) I wrote a plan, consulted with practitioners whom I trusted, but the plan was not alive.  I didn‚Äôt feel in myself the willingness to breathe this project, I didn‚Äôt consider such a business to be a truly super business and therefore I did half the work. <br>  I could not find a reason.  What didn't I like?  The product is cool, I myself will buy these things myself and as a gift, as soon as I arrange delivery.  Audience ... I chose you correctly, because I myself am the same.  I want to talk to you, build good service, <br><br>  But!  I finally lit up and here I am writing to you.  Shop will not be!  There will be a community that can determine what products should be in the store, what you like and what not.  There will be no ‚Äúclient base‚Äù - there will be people with their own habits, characters, interests.  It will be possible to choose any foreign gadget and order it without prepayment (you will have to work with this option and, perhaps, I will enter it not immediately).  There will be an individual attitude towards everyone who has not yet been provided by any trading project in Russia.  There will be an opportunity together to determine the development of the project, there will be an opportunity to organize an exhibition and touch a bunch of things about which no one in Russia has even heard of. <br><br>  I want to spend half the profit on community development (I will even publish financial reports available to club members).  How exactly would you like to develop it?  Here we need examples.  ISDEF, SPIK, RIF, etc., collect a lot of people.  But they are all dedicated to work.  And I want to spin everything around life and fun.  If everyone is interested, we will organize an exhibition of ergonomic chairs with controls or dogs with bioimplants, a cocktail party showing flexible Japanese players and learning Thai neck self-massage without getting up from the chair, or a tennis match of robots.  You can do everything, let's get the fan together! <br>  - I propose to start the discussion here.  Then, if necessary, we will try to open a company blog here and transfer discussions there. <br><br>  Also open <a href="http://smartface.us1.list-manage.com/subscribe%3Fu%3D9abc6fa0e660e4e5bc2a7a9b2%26id%3D00f2a2dc7e">subscription</a> with community news.  You can unsubscribe from it at any time in one click (there will be a link in the footer in each letter) <br><br>  There is a convenient domain on-up.ru, if you like the whole idea, you can make there a platform with everything you need. <br><br>  Read more about me (suddenly I'm some kind of rogue ;-) can be in the <a href="http://sinho.moikrug.ru/">profile on My Circle</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94247/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94247/</a></p>
