Add to this a small set of tools that will help in the planning process, lead generation and design of the product site. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/64e/490/389/64e4903894ac499fb47c1ee2d71966cc.png"></div><br>  <a href="http://startupgraveyard.io/"><b>Startup graveyard</b></a> <br><br>  We learn from the bitter, but rewarding experience of our predecessors.  Strartup Graveyard is a directory of startups that failed and were forced to leave the game.  The aim of the project, as the authors assert, is not to stigmatize people for mistakes - on the contrary, an objective, non-judgmental analysis of the factors that led one company or another to a sad outcome will allow them to ‚Äúremove stigma from failure‚Äù and build a more open, thoughtful community.  The case history is presented in a concise, clear form: name, niche, years of life, investors and budget, competitors, the main causes of the collapse.  Visitors are also invited to do their bit - to perform an autopsy of this kind on a project they know (perhaps even their own) and send the results to the administration. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <a href="https://outgrow.co/features/"><b>Outgrow</b></a>

      Offer users something profitable?  Let them see for yourself.  Outgrow offers ready-made solutions to add an online calculator to the site, with which you can make the necessary calculations (the approximate cost of the service, cost savings) on the spot.  The system allows you to build complex formulas that calculate several values ‚Äã‚Äãat once, and accompany the calculations with a visual graphical representation.  Other types of interactive windows are available - for example, questionnaires and questionnaires.  According to the creators, the windows were designed with a view to increasing conversion and ease of customization - you can choose colors and add a logo to give them a more ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù look. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.netguru.co/callio"><b>Callio</b></a> <br><br>  For young companies, any call, even from potential partners and investors, even from a few customers is worth its weight in gold.  Netguru created a solution based on the integration of Twilio and Slack services, which leaves you almost no chance of picking up the phone.  Alerts about an incoming call are sent straight to the specified Slack channel, any participant can answer them directly from the web browser.  All conversations are automatically recorded, so you will not have to mess around with fixing key points on paper or in notes.  When the conversation is finished, an alert from the service that the line is free appears in the channel.  The creators emphasize that the Twilio + Slack + Callio set of tools perfectly replaces a landline telephone.  The program code is in the public domain. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/630/478/68a/63047868abc1469cb7f045f7c160bf0e.png"></div><br><br>  <a href="https://www.vervoe.com/"><b>Vervoe</b></a> <br><br>  A tool for partial automation of the selection of candidates for a particular vacancy.  Vervoe provides an opportunity to write a script with basic questions and tasks that will be offered to the applicant online as the first stage of the interview.  Different survey formats are available: simple text, questionnaires, questions with audio and video materials, the ability to upload files.  No one will force you to test test items in real time: all the completed questionnaires are saved by the system, they can be evaluated at any time.  Deshbord allows you to track the overall situation with applications and sort applicants by results and statuses. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.prelaunchpage.com/"><b>Prelaunch Page</b></a> <br><br>  Even if your startup is still at the stage of a vague idea and a heap of mockups, it is never superfluous to get an audience and listen to what people think.  Prelaunch Page is an online website builder, which in a couple of minutes with a little your help will create a nice exported landing page, sharpened just for these purposes.  Tell visitors about your project in a nutshell and suggest leaving an e-mail address to keep them updated.  The tool is simple, intuitive and free. <br><br>  <a href="https://hunter.io/"><b>Hunter</b></a> <br><br>  Aim search for leads and contacts.  If you need to find out the mail of a particular person, the corporate mailbox of the company or, on the contrary, find out who owns this or that address, this service will scour the Internet in search of references and give you all the results.  The search is performed by parameters such as first name, last name and domain;  Results may include e-mail addresses, owner names and positions, company information and phone numbers.  There is also the possibility of checking addresses for validity.  The Google Chrome browser extension allows you to instantly unload all addresses associated with a domain.  Those who need only 150 searches per month can use the tool for free. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.publicfast.com/"><b>Publicfast 2.0</b></a> <br><br>  Platform for collaboration between bloggers and startup owners.  By registering on the site, the first get access to fresh interesting ideas that other authors have not heard about in the niche, and the second - the opportunity to "light up" and get advertising.  The creators of Publicfast are not praised for their big names, but on the contrary, emphasize that middle-level bloggers who are interested in finding promising and distinctive projects that could be illuminated for their audience fall into the partners.  The service works with a wide range of social networks: Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Vkontak, in the near future also Snapchat, musica.ly and Periscope will be connected.  You can set up campaigns, voice requirements and deadlines, make payments and track results directly on the site. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/dda/677/01b/dda67701b55b482886ee8699a187a6bf.png"></div><br><br>  <a href="https://convertloop.co/"><b>Convertloop</b></a> <br><br>  A tool for segmenting the target audience and e-mail marketing.  The service creates a unified database of contact information for customers and leads and tracks the behavior of each user (frequency of visits, registration, purchase, and actions on the site).  On the basis of the collected data, the system determines to whom and at what time to send one of the message templates that you have prepared - be it information about new arrivals, a special offer, or a reminder.  You can set the list of trigger actions yourself;  information about user actions and log reports are also publicly available.  In particular, it is possible to assess the effectiveness of the tool by looking at the statistics of user interaction with letters. <br><br>  <a href="https://pluckhq.com/"><b>Pluck</b></a> <br><br>  A tool that allows you to expand the base of contacts for cold letters at the expense of the audience of social networks.  Pluck currently only works with twitter.  Users are selected to the contact list based on the relevant tags, words and phrases or addresses, the list of which the user sets himself - this may be the name of your own or competitive product, mention of some kind of event or problem.  The team invokes to find out for you the email addresses of selected users using mysterious algorithms and daily draw them into a list that can be exported for subsequent distribution. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.hubspot.com/products/marketing/lead-flows"><b>Lead flows</b></a> <br><br>  The service is based on a simple idea: "The fewer the steps, the higher the conversion."  The solution from the company Hubspot allows you to perform the entire chain of actions up to the target, without leaving the source page, which makes life easier for both the client and the layout makers.  The interface element that the user will interact with may have a different appearance (a drop-down banner, a pop-up window, a slider) and appear on the page under the conditions that you see fit.  Lead Flows also provides detailed lead reports that you can use to adjust the interface. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/330460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/330460/</a></p>
