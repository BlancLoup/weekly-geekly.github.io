N91, N92, N93. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example: <br>  - N91.  The best sound even now, but the poor screen and the average camera repelled the mass user <br>  - N92.  Focus on DVB-H.  Actually, I will come back to this device. <br>  - N93.  Cameron.  Really large camera module and optical zoom, which is very pleased.  I will not mention the powerful glands.  Everything is on the level. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/97bd34b0/f2ec2128/e47d0b08/57d237d4.jpg"><br>  But here in Finland they realized that the specialized device would not become as massive as the ‚Äúall in one‚Äù device and decided to do something fundamentally different, taking Nokia N93 and Symbian 9.2 as the basis. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/78d2949b/55e14edf/30038b1b/de2d6f8c.jpg"><br>  No need to guess - this is, of course, the <i>Nokia N95</i> . <br><br>  So, the output of this device was the emergence of a new era of smartphones.  Powerful hardware, a good camera, an excellent screen, an interesting form factor and all this in one device, but the main thing is a huge advertising pump that spoke about Nokia‚Äôs Mobile Computer and in part it was true.  The flip side of the medal was 64MB of RAM, available from which was only 18MB, which is by no means a bad thing for the ‚Äúmobile computer‚Äù.  You can also recall the battery capacity of 950mAh ... <br>  The sad situation, but in those days this smartphone was relevant.  Especially its price tag.  But it was the first device on Symbian 9.2, and then he was ready to forgive a lot. <br><br>  People bought, people were happy, people were seething, but in fact there were no serious opponents for the N95.  More precisely, the omnipresent Samsung was here and succeeded, but for all their chicness, these devices were not massive, which, as it were, tells us about Nokia on the horse. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/7582f56e/681ec792/a623e1a4/c2eb9fe9.jpg"><br>  It took a long time.  We managed to get N93i, N76, E90, N800, N77 (by the way, I will return to it too), E65, E61i. ... But suddenly Nokia announces N95 8Gb.  For an ordinary user, it would seem that the N95 with 8-gigabytes of ROM-memory, but it was not there!  The novelty also had a screen increased by 0.2 inches, an increased battery capacity of 250mAh, there was no camera shutter, and of course the most important thing was 128MB of RAM memory, among which there were as many as 90MB available to the user.  A record for that moment, is it not wonderful?

      And here is the long-awaited announcement.  Nokia N96.  The advertising company is even larger than the previous model, and at first it seemed that there is something to advertise.  16 gigabytes of internal memory;  Symbian 9.3;  additional player buttons on the front panel gave out a multimedia orientation of the device;  DVB-H receiver ... Everything seemed cloudless, the model should have surpassed the N95 8Gb, but the N96 came out, the price tag shone with 25 thousand rubles and people were sure that Nokia would send the improved N95 8Gb for this money, but the harsh truth of life arranged everything in its place and according to some sources, the production of N96 was closed as early as six months later. <br>  Why  Because people were unhappy.  Nokia has decided not to do more "muscular" smartphones "all in one", not to run in pursuit of innovation and top-end hardware.  The company, after watching the success of the well-known Steve Jobs, decided to make smartphones designed for services.  At the same time completely forgetting about the power of the device.  Thought that People shvaet.  But we see another picture. <br>  The model turned out to be a failure, and in order to understand this, let's see these arguments: <br><br>  First of all.  Player buttons ... if you made a double-sided slide, then why fencing these buttons on the front panel?  Because of them, on the front panel is very high accuracy. <br>  Secondly.  Hardware component.  The fact is that this model is a complete analogue of the Nokia N92, but in a different form factor, already on Symbian 9.3 and equipped with 128MB of RAM memory.  The list of differences ends here. <br>  The whole embarrassment is that Nokia is going to release a replacement for the N95 8Gb in the face of the reissued N92.  forgetting at the same time that the release date of N92 is 2005-2006th year. <br>  Fun?  Highly!  Especially if we recall that the N92 had a battery with a capacity of 1500mAh, while in the N96 Nokia had never been stingy, putting 950mAh. <br>  And this is with the same gland. <br>  Thirdly.  Symbian 9.3 and 16GB of memory.  I will combine this section, because there is little to say about memory.  Symbian 9.3 was supposed to be a breakthrough, but it turned out to be a buggy axis, but with visualization.  This attracted the eyes of buyers.  But the OS itself was terribly flawed, because  it consumes a lot of RAM memory, has a terrible gallery, slow work ... 16GB of memory only aggravates it. <br>  To understand this, fill it in ¬Ω, the result will not take long. <br>  Fourth.  Was it necessary to poke in the DVB-H machine?  As I promised, I remember the N77, which was a complete copy of the N73, but with DVB-H.  N73 was very popular and Nokia decided to kill two birds with one stone, firing a similar model, but with a new chip.  However, alas, sales were minimal. <br>  Feel the analogy? <br>  N73 -&gt; N77 <br>  N92 -&gt; N96 <br>  The most problem is that N96 was perceived by customers as a replacement for N95 8Gb, and N77 as an independent product. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/8712f27c/dac25536/046d811b/16a3cf70.jpg"><br>  In general, everything can be simply explained.  After the release of the iPhone (Dada, Nokia fans will start throwing rotten tomatoes at me and stuff, but not the point), the Finns lost their grip.  As in boxing.  Knocked breath and everything.  One missed strike after another. <br>  Actually output N96 was not the most successful.  Glory for a long time belonged to N95 and its 8 gigabyte version.  People took the N96 spontaneously or simply because of the design they liked. <br><br>  In conclusion I want to write that this is just the prehistory of the beginning of a great end.  We kind of see the development of events that has been preserved to this day, but having modified ourselves a little.  I hope that you liked the first part and you will read the second with the same interest, about the devices of our days: n8, n900. <br>  (SECOND PART here: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/nokia/112796/">habrahabr.ru/blogs/nokia/112796</a> ) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112670/</a></p>
