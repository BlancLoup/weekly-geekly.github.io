After the last 4 years I tried to buy it twice and reproduce it twice as a separate application.  We <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/321372/">have already written</a> about this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8e/57c/0f7/d8e57c0f75cd47c790da2e1f5f046fa5.jpg"><br><br>  Yesterday, the date when the functionality resembling Snapchat Stories ‚Äúrolled out‚Äù WhatsApp became known.  Starting from February 24, users of this messenger can post photos instead of text in their statuses for a day.  You can place a photo, but you can video or GIF-ki.  This functionality is called WhatsApp Status and it was announced yesterday, February 20, <a href="https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000630/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2581-WhatsApp%3F">in the company's blog</a> .

      Among the obvious reasons why Zuckerberg from year to year is trying to copy this or that functionality of the messenger Evan Spiegel for two reasons: <br><br>  - the struggle for a young audience.  Here in the past six months Instagram has performed well.  Half of the users of it are already actively involved in the local counterpart of Stories. <br>  - the desire to cool investor interest in Snapchat, especially given the upcoming IPO. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is indicative that in the native facebook messenger the selections of photos and videos didn‚Äôt go much, judging by the test and the rejection of the introduction last summer.  But the success of similar "personal reports" on Instagram again changed Mark's opinion.  So soon we will see at the very top of the tape in facebook a running line of personal photo essays. <br><br><h2>  Will users rate </h2><br>  Up to full Snapchat'ovskih "stories" WhatsApp innovation does not hold out.  Although Status can be viewed in a separate tab, the competitor‚Äôs logic for grouping images creates a cinema hall effect with a continuous movie about the life of friends, and for WhatsApp, the description is more like a filmstrip.  We must of course see, but for now it looks like  On the other hand, ‚Äúfor‚Äù the future possible success of stories in the messenger says the figure of 3.3 billion photos sent by users every day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef2/6a0/4bd/ef26a04bdb844c7da005c14f400855db.jpg"><br><br>  But it's not only that.  By copying features and functionality, Zuckerberg cannot copy behavioral attitudes: what comes to the application and what behavior is copied;  show yourself or see others.  Read the news or pofludit in the comments.  Even if there is a functional for any type of behavior, one part of it will be used, and the other will not.  Much depends on the communication history in the application and on the audience.  It is no coincidence that the visual and youth Instagram managed to climb on the Snapchat ªa platform, while others do not.  It is unlikely that it will work for WhatsApp and Facebook messenger.  There are not common these patterns of behavior.  As Snapchat described one of its adherents - ‚ÄúSnapchat allows not only to try on many different masks, but also to come to terms with himself.  Snatchchat teaches living a moment, and not carefully choosing a moment to catalog the past. ‚Äù  There are fooling around, because it helps not to grow up.  In WhatsApp, for such a model, you will first need to relax, since "this is not the case here."  Relatively out-of-age "Stories" are certainly less demanding of emancipation, but they also require more internal freedom than is accepted by the Zuckerberg audience. <br><br>  In order to visually complete the comparison, Muslims traditionally leave their shoes outside the door of their home.  It is rather strange to come to other audiences with the proposal ‚Äúnow and you can leave your shoes on the mat in front of the entrance‚Äù, although there are such traditions outside Muslims.  The model of behavior does not depend on which side the cleaner places the door mat on.  Users will pass on their own.  But food innovators, who rely only on features and functionality, think differently.  Mark is no exception, otherwise he would have repeated Snapchat for 3 years, when he still had a smaller audience.  At the same time, the innovation of WhatsApp Status will certainly play its role, and at the upcoming IPO, Evan Spiegel risks collecting less than expected. <br><br>  By the way, the ‚Äústories‚Äù functionality is also ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù.  It was planned exclusively on smartphones.  I don‚Äôt have it in the desktop version and on the iPad, but already in the comments there are already VK users with ‚ÄúStories‚Äù. <br><br>  In personal messages, you can share "stories" on all platforms.  Strange, but somewhat understandable.  Like Spiegel, VKontakte ‚Äúcomes‚Äù from a device where the camera is most often used to create content and news. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/697/6f4/c16/6976f4c16f1548e598f2b118c37a9637.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322270/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322270/</a></p>
