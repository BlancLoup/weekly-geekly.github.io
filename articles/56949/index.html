    <a name="habracut"></a>  You will be asked: <br>  Legal details of the organization (everything is simple) <br><br>  Name, address, telephone, email address of the administrative and technical contact for future networks. <br><br>  If there are NIC-HANDLE in the RIPE database, they are indicated and then there will be no need to write extra bytes of text. <br><br>  Network description, for which real addresses are required and in what quantity.  Approximate development plan for two years. <br><br>  The most incomprehensible of all the questions is written above, in the sense that if I were a provider, I could somehow predict something there, and for a content resource that has the entire address space, it is easily hidden in the form of a non-unique subnet 192.168.0 / 24 for a pair of foreign addresses of front-ends and balancers is hard. <br><br>  But even less / 24 for technical reasons, you still do not allocate, so in my case the choice was clear in favor of / 24 well, and a lie began. <br><br>  It was necessary to write in free form that it is planned to consume about 70% of the address space in two years, that it is planned to promote VDS services, etc.  hosting sites that will consume address space (well, I didn‚Äôt even figure out how to lie differently). <br><br>  In addition, they will ask if your answer to one of which (the equipment used) has already stumped the registrar, they said that noname is not the right word to use as the name of the server manufacturer to return the current address range to their upstream provider and a few more questions. :) <br><br>  I honestly took the numbers of the autonomy of the neighbors on the websites of the neighbors :)  at the time of registration of the autonomous system I have not yet decided which of the DCs I will place the equipment in. <br><br>  At this the procedure was completed and a couple of weeks I received <br>  Notification of RIPE Database changes <br>  with the long-awaited OBJECT BELOW CREATED: <br>  In the form of its subgrid, which I remembered in a moment, well, and a week later the autonomous number came. <br><br>  When I came up with two digits on my hands, I turned to my networker friends (oriflame, heralife and sellers of Kirby vacuum cleaners, go to hell about network administrators) what to do to see your ip as a working piece / etc / network / interfaces <br><br>  Some said that except using Cisco, they don‚Äôt have any idea how to solve my problem and, in general, all ips in ciscs are born and die there.  It became clear to a person who knows what DNS is by the method of analogies that they simply can‚Äôt see my Novosibirsk ip in the states if I don‚Äôt prescribe it somewhere (by the way, RIPE) But after all the tortures they dropped the new one the term is BGP. <br>  Leaving the trial with quagga for now, the selection of equipment and connection diagrams began. <br><br>  The drawing of the connection scheme has begun, since  There were several options, but as was shown, at least practice was optimal for me.  Those who knew the scheme offered enough tsiski for kilobaksy and L2 and L3 switches with BGP and much more.  But when conversations about bandwidth of a couple of hundred megabits began, the proposed solutions in the price list were already indecently worth a lot of zeros. <br><br>  So, for myself (I repeat it again, the portal, so the specificity of traffic consumption is constant and it was decided to ignore the possible dullness of budget equipment, in the sense that it could be predicted, and any slashdot effects would be reflected more quickly on web servers rather than router) was chosen the following scheme. <br><br><img src="http://a0.1nsk.ru/3/51fd30547e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  The links from the providers, the link from the backbone were installed in Dlink DES-3526, from which, through the way, the Gigabit port available there already in the form of VLANs was added to the router.  Because  The BGP software version is definitely guagga, then the further path was to reading the documentation on it ... <br><br>  continuation a little later, time trouble :) <br><br>  ps the original will lie here - <a href="http://developers.1nsk.ru/blog/305.html">http://developers.1nsk.ru/blog/305.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56949/</a></p>
