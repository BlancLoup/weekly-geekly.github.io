  <section class="page js-page"><h1>40+ facts about Peter Mitrichev</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Those who are at least a little familiar with the topic, the name of Peter Mitrichev aka <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc%3Fmodule%3DMemberProfile%26cr%3D10574855%26tab%3Dalg">Petr</a> certainly familiar.  And Petya‚Äôs fame is purely positive.  Well, what could be wrong with <a href="http://www.topcoder.com/tc%3Fmodule%3DAlgoRank">being number one in the world of sports programming</a> ?  :) Petya repeatedly surprised with his achievements and at times it seemed that it was really beyond human capabilities.  How fast Petya thinks, how quickly he solves, kodit and hands over tasks.  Therefore, to be surprised that, by analogy with Chuck Norris, ‚Äú40+ facts about Pet Mitrichev‚Äù did not appear at all. <br><br>  So, we read and we laugh kindly :) Perhaps it will be difficult for someone in some places due to the lack of relevant knowledge to appreciate humor, but I hope we will break through :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      0. Every month $ 2,560 comes to Petit's bank account.  They are sent to him by Donald Knut. <br><br>  1. The organizers of the Olympiad, where Petya Mitrichev participates, do not write the tests themselves.  They know that they can always be asked from Petit, and they will have half an hour left so that they can be screwed in for the rest of the participants. <br><br>  2. Peter compiles his source code before submitting only to detect bugs in the compiler. <br><br>  3. When Petya Mitrichev passes by the flag of China, he shyly rolls up into a tube <br><br>  4. Petya is waiting for the release of the USB 3.0 standard, because the current one makes it wait too long while typing the code. <br><br>  5. The only mistake Petya can get is the time limit.  The thing is that time in testing systems is often represented as unsigned numbers, and many Petit programs run so fast that they run in negative time. <br><br>  6. When Petya was invited to work at Google, he rewrote the entire search engine 16 times in 15 minutes.  But he was asked to keep it a secret, because his program was quietly working on the 486th, and for the dismissal of thousands of data center employees on Google would be sued. <br><br>  7. Petya thinks so quickly that from the near-light speeds of some molecules his head becomes heavier by 15%. <br><br>  8. When a misprint in the condition of the problem crept in, making it NP-complete, Petya did not lose his head and proved in half an hour that P = NP. <br><br>  9. Proof of Riemann's theorem appears in Petit in one of the problems for 250. He was too lazy to write a blunt bust. <br><br>  10. Petya is able to prove and disprove the theorem on self-applicability in the same proof, and to complete it with the proof that these facts do not contradict each other. <br><br>  11. Peter does not like LCD monitors.  While they have time to change the frame, he is already writing the next page of code. <br><br>  12. Petya does not like to use the mouse, because he does not tolerate the smell of burning plugs. <br><br>  13. Petya never uses epsilons in geometric problems, because in his programs floating-point calculations never give an error. <br><br>  14. In fact, all the major highways of the Internet were dismantled in 2002.  But no one notices, because Petina program provides data transfer, as if everything, as before.  No one knows how it works, but Petya will not tell. <br><br>  15. The world is still intact, because Petya proved to Chuck Norris that he would never be able to complete his roundabout kick, because for that he would first have to make a half turn of the leg. <br><br>  16. Peter with a smile, watching the progress of quantum computing.  He himself has long been hacking 1024-bit RSA in 3.5 seconds in the mind. <br><br>  17. All targets before bedtime pray to Pete Mitrichev.  As soon as the target ceases to do this, it ceases to be the target. <br><br>  18. Petya has not been interested in SRMs for a long time.  He participates in them only to draw a certain curve on his rating chart.  Of course, he counts the time needed for this, based on the indicators of all participants. <br><br>  19. Peter does not play on the computer.  Once looking at the toy binaries, he is able to play it in a dream.  And without brakes.  And with much better graphics.  And in the morning he writes saves in a hex editor. <br><br>  20. Peter does not use the Internet.  The program written by him in 2002, which now supports his working capacity, has long downloaded the entire Internet and issued Pete that there is nothing interesting for him in it.  Petya believes her program, because he wrote it. <br><br>  21. Petya allows scientists around the world to look for efficient algorithms to search for the maximum flow in the network just because it is fun.  He himself has long invented an algorithm that works for O (E). <br><br>  22. Peter has long ago developed a program that can compile any algorithm for an arbitrarily fuzzy task.  In the worst case, the algorithm has complexity O (lnlnlnN). <br><br>  23. Peter never writes an algorithm for decomposing numbers into prime factors.  At the sight of Petit, the numbers for fear factorize themselves. <br><br>  24. It is known that when Petya was born, the huge AMD processor glowed brighter than hundreds of stars in the sky, silicone suddenly poured from under the stones in the desert, and Knut, Dijkstra and Wirth came to him. <br><br>  25. When Petya wants to upgrade a laptop, he goes to the final of the World Programming Championship and wins a new one there.  Unfortunately, the organizers of the final quickly realized what was wrong and were forbidden to participate in the final more than two times. <br><br>  26. The virus, which in the film "Independence Day" Americans launched aliens, wrote Peter. <br><br>  27. In the room where CPM Petya plays, admins disable system tests.  All the wrong decisions chelendzhit Peter, and the rest just immediately put up a status Passed System Test. <br><br>  28. Petiny teammates always take a detective with them to the contest so that it is not boring to sit idle for 5 hours. <br><br>  29. Petya is not interested in the demo scene since he wrote the program, which for any demo produces an exe file of 512 bytes in size, which draws a picture 6 times more beautiful. <br><br>  30. A person who has tried to rationalize Petit‚Äôs decision takes away 10 points of karma from himself and in the next life is born a Hindu. <br><br>  31. Any Petino exponential solution is faster than the logarithmic ACRush solution on any tests. <br><br>  32. Peter found all the bugs in Vista. <br><br>  33. Peter does not like to waste time.  Therefore, in his free time he searches for natural numbers, the sum of the cubes of two of which is equal to the cube of the third.  Alas, natural numbers will end soon, and he will have to look for a new occupation. <br><br>  34. Peter is not all-powerful: he cannot write a program that he himself cannot understand. <br><br>  35. The development team of the debugger in Visual Studio is terribly jealous of the developers of the C # compiler.  The thing is, Peter has already found and fixed all the bugs in the compiler, and he never uses the debugger. <br><br>  36. Pete does not need a version control system.  Each function created by it works correctly the first time and does not change anymore. <br><br>  37. The scroll buttons, Delete and Insert on Petina keyboard have long been overgrown with dust. <br><br>  38. Peter, without hesitation, lays on the K5 plane. <br><br>  39. Peter does not use the form designer.  It is faster for him to write the code generated by him with his hands. <br><br>  40. Mathematicians who did not recognize the proof of the 4-color theorem, because it used a computer program in which errors are possible, recently agreed to consider the proof to be completely correct.  It became known that the program was checked by Petya. <br><br>  41. Peter numbered all the elements of the continuum.  Twice. <br><br>  42. Petya knows the question of the answer to life, the universe and everything else. <br><br>  <strong>Source:</strong> <a href="http://sharpc.livejournal.com/21303.html">sharpc.livejournal.com/21303.html</a> <br><br>  * I can not add this fact from the comments.  Simple and tasteful :) <br><br>  <em>Every programmer who has ever seen the source of the Petite programs at least once in his life invariably comes to mind the question of the meaninglessness of his life.</em> <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/sport_programming/39790.html">here is the</a> original.
