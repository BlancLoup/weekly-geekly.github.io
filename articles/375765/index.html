GRE Subject can be either a mandatory requirement of the university, or optional.  Depending on the specialization of the master program, you will be asked to pass one or more GRE subject tests.  Passing this exam can significantly increase the chances of a student enrolling.

      The GRE subject exam is held in <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/subject/about">seven disciplines</a> .  The test takes place in paper format, and the certificate is valid for five years.  Students have 170 minutes to complete all the tasks.  Below we take a detailed look at the specifics of the test, using the example of GRE Subject Math. <br><br>  <b>GRE Mathematics Subject Test Structure</b> <br><br>  The GRE Math Exam consists of 66 assignments covering various areas of higher mathematics.  Most of the tasks of this test are questions on integral and differential calculi and the peculiarities of their use in trigonometry and geometry.  Exam assignments also cover such areas of mathematics as algebra (elementary, general, linear), number theory, topology, complex and computational analysis, statistics and probability theory.  Some tasks relate to algorithmic processes, discrete mathematics, and other areas. <br><br>  The tasks of GRE Mathematics Subject Test have the format of multiple choice and are solved by choosing the correct answer from the options presented.  On the execution of all tasks allotted only 170 minutes.  This time is enough to solve problems on average.  However, given the complexity of the exam, the skill of quickly completing tasks must be worked out in advance. <br><br>  <b>How to prepare for the test?</b> <br><br>  Of course, the GRE math exam cannot boast simplicity and ease.  However, its complexity is not higher than the mathematics taught in the undergraduate program.  The main thing in preparing to get good knowledge from various fields.  For example, it is worth paying attention to the study of real and complex analysis, elementary and discrete mathematics, analytic geometry, differential equations, topology, algebra, combinatorics, and other sections of higher mathematics. <br><br>  More information about the features of the GRE Mathematics Subject exam can be found <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/ru/News_MBA/detail.php%3FID%3D1445797">here</a> . <br><br>  Note: <br><br>  1. In preparing for the GRE Math test, it is important to know the basic principles of various areas of mathematics and be able to use them correctly.  And for this you need to do not only memorizing theory, but also practice.  With the help of various exercises and test tests, you can more thoroughly study the requirements and characteristics of the tasks, as well as get good skills in solving various types of tasks. <br><br>  2. To prepare for a mathematical test, it is recommended to use specialized manuals, in which there is useful information and practical tasks, and other materials that allow you to get all the necessary knowledge and skills to successfully pass this test.  For example, we can recommend such textbooks as: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cracking-GRE-Mathematics-Subject-Test/dp/0375429727/">Cracking the GRE Mathematics Subject Test, 4th Edition</a> ; <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ <a href="http://www.amazon.com/GRE-Math-Prep-Course-Novas/dp/1889057592/">GRE Math Prep Course (Nova's GRE Prep Course)</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bea/5b5/83b/bea5b583b4b4412880af3112c49caa98.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We recommend that you download the collection of tasks from the official site - <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/subject/about/content/mathematics">The Practice Book (Mathematics Test)</a> . <br><br>  We will also briefly review the remaining 6 subjects of the GRE Subject: <br><br>  <b>Biochemistry, Molecular and Cellular Biology</b> <br><br>  This exam tests the level of knowledge of students in three areas: biochemistry, cell biology, genetics and microbiology.  The test consists of 180 questions, distributed respectively to the three areas presented in the proportion of 36% -28% -36%. <br><br>  <b>Biology</b> <br><br>  The test includes 190 questions distributed equally between the three main topics - ecology and evolution, biology of organisms, molecular and cell biology. <br><br>  <b>Chemistry</b> <br><br>  The test consists of 130 questions.  They are distributed in the following percentages: <br>  ‚Ä¢ organic chemistry - 30%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ inorganic chemistry - 25%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ physical chemistry - 30%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ analytical chemistry - 15%. <br><br>  <b>English language and literature</b> <br><br>  The test consists of 230 questions relating to the literature of the United States, United Kingdom and other countries.  It requires students to know the main literary works studied in universities and their authors, the ability to analyze the works of famous writers.  In addition, it is necessary to study the Bible, because  The exam has questions about this book.  As a test for the ability to perceptive reading, explanatory questions are offered, which are also used to identify the student's abilities to perceive poetry, dramatic works, and artistic prose.  In this test, there are two main qualifications, according to which the distribution of questions by topic occurs. <br><br>  In the first ratio is as follows: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ cultural and historical context - 20-25%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ theory and history of literary criticism - 10-15%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ literary analysis - 40-55%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ identification, identification - 15-20%. <br><br>  The second classification is the following proportions: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ classical, comparative and continental literature until 1925 - 5-10%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ American literature before 1925 - 15-25%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ British literature before 1600 - 25-30%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ world, American and British literature after 1925 - 20-30%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ British literature from 1660 to 1925.  - 25-35%. <br><br>  <b>Physics</b> <br><br>  Testing includes 100 questions.  They are distributed by subject in the following way: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ classical mechanics - 20%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ quantum mechanics - 12%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ electromagnetism - 18%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ static mechanics and thermodynamics - 10%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ atomic physics - 10%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ special theory of relativity - 6%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ progressive topics including condensed matter physics, astrophysics and nuclear and elementary particle physics - 9%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ wave phenomena and optics - 9%; <br>  ‚Ä¢ laboratory methods - 6%. <br><br>  <b>Psychology</b> <br><br>  The total number of questions is 205. Of these, 40% are devoted to experimental psychology, 43% to social, and 17% to other topics (methodology, measurement, production and organizational psychology). <br><br>  Sign up for GRE Subject Tests <a href="http://www.ets.org/gre/subject/register">here</a> . <br><br>  <i>In the final article of this series we will tell you how to choose the right tutor to prepare for GRE.</i>  <i>Even the most intelligent and talented candidates need a person who has already passed the test and knows all his ‚Äúpitfalls‚Äù.</i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/375765/">https://habr.com/ru/post/375765/</a></p>
