  <section class="page js-page"><h1>First experience with the Mail.ru cloud</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of last year, information passed on Habr√© that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/206860/">Mail.ru gives a terabyte in the cloud for free</a> .  As usual, on holidays this information did not find application, but the approach on January 20, after which the free distribution of terabyte should stop, led to the fact that a few days ago I started an experiment. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  I have been using clouds for a long time. </h4>  Historically, Dropbox was the first, then tightly hooked on SugarSync.  His killer features for me were: synchronization of any folder on the computer and auto-synchronization of the selected directory with Android.  But everything changes, and the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/206304/">speedy transition of the latter exclusively to paid tariffs</a> prompted the search for alternatives. <br>  Here, as it was impossible on time, and an attractive offer Mail.ru.  I have an ambiguous attitude towards this campaign.  On the one hand, I have been using their mail for a very long time, and on the other hand, I constantly wear unnecessary satellites and protectors with my friends.  Again, the license agreement immediately alerted, but after <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/207780/">it was changed for the better</a> , the questions were dropped. <br>  I have no idea how and why now it is necessary to synchronize a terabyte on all computers of the user (perhaps, soon this statement will seem ridiculous).  This is the full amount of HDD on my home computer (DC).  There is also a media server with 1.5 TB for video and audio, on which it is not necessary to duplicate most of the DK files (and vice versa).  The third client is a laptop with a 120 GB SSD (everywhere is Windows - seven, XP and 8.1, respectively).  The picture is complemented by a smartphone on Android. <br><br><h4>  The key requirement for the Mail.ru client, </h4>  In this regard, it became possible to select folders for synchronization.  There is such an option, but it is implemented somewhat strangely: not during installation, but after it.  Accordingly, if there is already data in the cloud, at first they will start to be poured onto the screw, and only then you can choose the right one.  Firstly, this is inconvenient, and besides, I constantly turned on the synchronization of even the folders excluded from the exchange, when they were intensively loading data from another computer. <br>  It turns out, you need to connect each computer to the cloud one by one (after stopping synchronization on the other clients), and then set up the folders.  True, this setting can only be done when synchronization is enabled, so that some of the extra information will fall on the screw anyway) <br><br><h4>  A few related comments: </h4>  location of the exchange folder is configured;  subjectively, synchronization is fast (there is nowhere to see the speed, just like the list and order of the copied files);  The virtual machine file of about 50 GB in size never got to the cloud - perhaps there are restrictions on the volume.  Images 2-3 GB loaded normally. <br>  The total amount of data in the cloud I now have a little less than 100 GB.  Perhaps it will grow gradually, and maybe I will include my archives in it, and it will increase by a jump of two to three times.  I don‚Äôt see any sense in synchronizing the collection of films and games - you can always download them again.  The fact that the data is synchronized with the cloud reassures me rather than strains - there is no paranoia, and all the key information is stored in encrypted form.

      <br>
      In conclusion, I want to dream up on <h4>  somehow would like to see the cloud Mail.ru </h4>  First of all, you need to change the mechanism for setting folders for synchronization: <br><ul><li>  Add a wizard during installation; </li><li>  Open the ability to configure when synchronization is stopped; </li><li>  Correct the situation with the spontaneous connection of folders; </li><li>  Add the option to synchronize only the specified directories; </li><li>  Make auto-sync selected folders with Android. </li></ul>  To improve the convenience of work add: <br><ul><li>  List of synchronized files with the ability to change the order; </li><li>  Settings for the speed of data exchange and display of current indicators; </li><li>  Wizard to transfer data to the cloud.  Let me explain: now there is a real opportunity to duplicate all user information in the cloud.  It is necessary to automate the transfer of system folders (for example, "My Documents"). </li><li>  Ability to close access to third-party users, previously provided to them (in fact, reset the links); </li><li>  Manage connected devices on Mail.ru server. </li></ul>  Choose your monetization option - it is not necessary to build on the volume of the cloud.  In my opinion, users can pay for features such as: <br><ul><li>  Synchronization of any folders on the computer; </li><li>  Storing multiple versions of files; </li><li>  Work with large files larger than a DVD image; </li><li>  Connecting folders of other users - in general, collaboration is an area in which you can find a lot of new features. </li></ul><br>  In general, there is much to develop, and, I hope, Mail.ru will pay due attention to its new project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209430/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209430/</a></p>
