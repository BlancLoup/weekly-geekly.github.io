  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is wrong with your IT resume - experience based analysis</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As I mentioned in one of the previous articles, the release of a new functional is approaching (hereinafter referred to as the Resume Wizard), which should help to make a summary exactly the way companies and agents want it to be. <br><br>  How exactly Resume Wizard will help with the construction of a resume, I will tell in the article that I will write right after the release.  I will say only that each step contains a brief explanation of why this is the case, and not otherwise, that certain sections of the resume (title of the desired position, education, work experience, etc.) should be compiled.  And when I got to the section on work experience, I realized that I could not briefly reveal the essence of the main problem that I encountered in about half of the candidates.  This is the topic that I want to touch on in this article. <br><br>  Before turning to the matter, I want to say that everything that I will write further is based solely on the experience of the project in the German market, which includes feedback from agents, also companies (the project is already working with one company directly), my personal experience, and as well as information obtained from sources on the topic of significance of the summary and the principles of its writing. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Job hopping - this term refers to the frequent (every year or two) job changes.  In my opinion, 2 years is a normal period and the project‚Äôs experience confirms this - such candidates are readily considered by foreign companies. <br>  But about half of the candidates often have a job change interval of even less than a year.  For such a resume, I immediately get a ‚Äúred card‚Äù in the form of a ‚Äújob hopper‚Äù. <br>  Personally, I think that in 6-12 months it is possible to launch a viable project, recruit a team and take on a new project in a new company.  This is especially true for start-up projects.  Also, frequent job changes can mean a quick professional growth of a candidate.  And of course, it can mean that the candidate either does not live in the team or something else, most likely negative. <br><br>  Which of the above described options will incline a company that pays for an average candidate 15-20% of the annual salary (on average - 10 thousand euros)?  Of course, the company will rely on the candidate, in which he will see not only good technical knowledge, but also the prospect of long-term cooperation (2+ years).  In addition, any company wants to see in the candidate a sincere interest in the company's products.  But this is another interesting topic concerning more interviewing and will be covered in a separate article. <br><br>  I note that among the job hopper candidates there are many highly skilled specialists. <br><br>  This is the situation on the labor market of IT specialists in Germany.  But I think this applies to all of Europe.  Since from a Dutch agent I only get a request for ‚ÄúA-players‚Äù (The top 5% of people. I‚Äôm up and down <br><br>  What to do, because the history can not be rewritten?  I advise you not to indicate jobs if you worked there for less than a year and a half, as separate companies with work dates.  It is better to single it out as one whole period of cooperation with a number of companies on a contract basis.  Contract work is a common phenomenon in the civilized world and there are a lot of companies that hire specialists for 3-6 months.  In this case, the employer will have a natural question - what have you done during this time successful.  If you managed to launch a project in 3-6 months.  and it works now - that is a very fat plus.  It is also advisable to have recommendations from companies where you have been working for less than a year and a half (it is generally desirable to have them, but in this case it is very desirable).  So you dispel suspicions about your personal qualities. <br><br>  Of course it will help, but is not a guarantee.  But I think that you need to do everything necessary to look professional. <br><br>  I want to draw particular attention to the fact that I in no way call fraudulently to get a job and then after six months or a year resign in favor of another.  Honesty and sincerity are essential components of a successful candidate.  It will turn out to be deceived once, or maybe two times, but such a candidate will quickly become famous and will be hired only by companies that treat their employees in the same way. <br><br>  Personally, I think that changing jobs once a year is even good.  I myself am a supporter of working exactly as long as it is interesting, while I am really useful to the company. <br>  Of course, I mean change jobs after successfully completing the tasks. <br><br>  Thus, the next release (after the Resume Wizard) will develop the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãchanging the situation in such a way that the job is looking for us, not us the job.  This not only sounds tempting, but also quite realistic.  At least I believe in it and I want to try to implement it for everyone, and for myself. <br><br>  - A little bit about the demand: the very strong experts of PHP, Java, JavaScript, QA, NodeJs are asked. <br><br>  As I already mentioned, there is a German company that needs .NET specialists. <br>  This is a direct contact (without intermediaries) <br><br>  Like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/coolitrabota">facebook</a> group to keep abreast of all vacancies. <br><br>  Have a good day! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298992/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298992/</a></p>
