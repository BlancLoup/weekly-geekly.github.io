Now it's 2010, and you won't surprise anyone with the optical Internet at home with a 100 megabit channel or $ 49 for the monthly rent of a dedicated server.  Progress does not stand still, let us look at the figures, how the Network has changed over the past 2009y year. <br>  The picture described under habrakat was obtained after analyzing the latest reports of <a href="http://www.pingdom.com/">Pingdom</a> , <a href="http://www.webboar.com/">Domain IP History</a> and <a href="http://www.netcraft.com/">NetCraft</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, <br>  <b>Post office:</b> <br>  Over the year, over <b>90</b> trillion e-mails were sent, which is approximately <b>247</b> million letters per day.  All this traffic was generated by almost <b>one and a half</b> billion email users worldwide. <br>  I think no one will see the percentage of spam in this volume of mail - <b>81</b> %, which is <b>24</b> % more than in the year 2008.  Well, I hope that the volume of spam will not exceed the 100% mark;) <br>  <b>Users:</b> <br>  The total number of network users: <b>1.73</b> billion.  I note that Wikipedia claims that in 2009 the world's population was approximately <b>6.832</b> billion people.  Thus, every 4th inhabitant of the planet uses the Internet, and every sixth inhabitant of the planet is hungry ... <br>  Total, the year 2009 gave the network <b>18</b> % of new users. <br>  But what surprises me: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/903/2d0/eaf/9032d0eaf9b93b59f3d98eed1ca62a2e.png" align="right"><br>  <b>738,257,230</b> - the number of users from Asia, <br>  <b>418,029,796</b> - Europeans and only <br>  <b>252,908,000</b> - from North America (see, what kind of round numbers counted). <br>  Latin America and the Caribbean grabbed a piece of <b>179,031,479</b> users, and Africa - "only" <br>  <b>67,371,700</b> people. <br><br>  <b>Sites / domains:</b> <br>  There are <a href="http://news.netcraft.com/">234</a> million domains on the Internet (including subdomains), which is <b>47</b> million more than it was a year ago. <br>  The total number of <a href="http://www.webboar.com/tld/">domains</a> ( <i>in the first level zones</i> ) is <b>187</b> million and they are located on almost 5 million ( <b>4.856.909</b> ) different IP addresses. <br>  That is, for each ip address there are a little more than <b>38</b> domains :) <br>  The latter fact is not entirely correct, because out of <b>187</b> million, only <b>131</b> million domains have IP (to be more precise - every 5th registered domain is not used for content placement and A records are not registered in the DNS).  With this amendment, each IP address, on average, carries <b>27</b> different websites. <br>  <b>Hosting:</b> <br>  The leader among hosting companies was GoDaddy with a list of more than <a href="http://www.webboar.com/isp/GO%2520DADDY%2520SOFTWARE%2520INC/">20 million</a> (!) Sites.  It is also the fastest growing company.  For example, in the last month alone, GoDaddy has sheltered over <b>170,000</b> <a href="http://www.webboar.com/isp/">new sites</a> in its network. <br>  I must say that I personally have only a negative experience with this company, but this is a topic for another note. <br>  Another interesting observation was that the 68.X.X.X network is currently the most densely populated on the Internet, with more than <b>15</b> million sites. <br>  Another observation in itself emerged from the data <a href="http://www.webboar.com/lang/">analysis of site languages</a> .  So, it turns out that <b>72.2</b> % of sites on the network are English-speaking, Chinese-speaking only <b>5.7</b> %, and <b>3.4</b> % of the websites are Spanish-speaking.  The penultimate fact sincerely surprised me.  The number of users does not always turn into quality? <br>  <b>Web server:</b> <br>  The distribution pattern of the server software is well represented in the diagram at the beginning of the topic. <br>  I will add it with figures on the growth and decline of market share (information was taken from <a href="http://www.pingdom.com/">pingdom</a> -a): <br>  <b>13.9%</b> - growth in the share of Apache in 2009. <br>  <b>-22.1%</b> - increase in the share of IIS in 2009. <br>  <b>35.0%</b> - growth in the share of Google GFE in 2009. <br>  <b>384.4%</b> - increase in the share of Nginx in 2009. <br>  <b>-72.4%</b> - Lighttpd share growth in 2009. <br>  Note nginx-jerk to which I myself translated everything that is possible;) <br>  By the way, does anyone have a hypothesis, why did Lighttpd lose so much? <br><br>  <b>Social networks and blogs:</b> <br>  I‚Äôll finish this statistical slice with data on blogs and other "social media": <br>  Currently, the number of blogs on the Web is <b>126</b> million. <br>  <b>84</b> % of all social networks, among their users, have more women than men (this really confused me). <br>  Twitter every day gives us <b>27.3</b> million meaningless short messages.  Forgive me Twitter fans, I sometimes use it myself;) By the way, more than half of <a href="http://www.twitter.com/">Twitter.com</a> users are located in the USA. <br>  And the last fact - the number of applications for Facebook has exceeded 500 (!) Thousand.
