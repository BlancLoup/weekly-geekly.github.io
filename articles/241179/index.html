      <strong>How to calculate insurance premiums</strong> <br><br>  If the incomes of individual entrepreneurs for the year do not exceed 300,000 rubles, then it is necessary to pay in the Pension Fund of Russia - 17,328.48 rubles, in the FFOMS - 3399.05 rubles. <br><br>  If the incomes of individual entrepreneurs for the year exceed 300,000 rubles, then the additional contribution to the Pension Fund is calculated by the formula: <br><br>  B = (D - 300 000) * 1%, where <br><ul><li>  B is an additional contribution to the FIU, </li><li>  D - this is the income of IP for the year. </li></ul><br>  For example, if the IE income for 2014 is 600,000 rubles, then he is obliged to pay: <br><ul><li>  In the FIU fixed fee - 17 328.48 rubles., </li><li>  In the FIU an additional fee - 3000 rubles.  ((600,000 ‚Äì300,000) * 1%), </li><li>  In the FFOMS - 3399.05 rubles. </li></ul><br>  <strong>How to pay insurance premiums</strong> <br><br>  Contributions in a fixed amount (20 727, 53 rubles.) Must be paid until December 31, an additional 1% to the FIU - before April 1 of the following year. <br><br>  Insurance contributions can be paid from the current account of the individual entrepreneur or by receipt at any branch of Sberbank.  Sample receipts can be downloaded from the FIU website <a href="http://www.pfrf.ru/zayav_kbk/9024.html">in your area</a> .  Contributions to the FIU and the FFOMS are paid by two receipts to different BCFs. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">CSC for the payment of insurance premiums</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  CSC for the payment of contributions to the FIU: <br>  392 1 02 02140 06 1000 160. <br><br>  CSC for the payment of contributions to the FFOMS: <br>  392 1 02 02101 08 1011 160. <br><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Taxes </h4><br>  After a company has incomes, it needs to pay advance payments and a tax on the simplified tax system. <br><br>  <strong>Advance payment by USN</strong> <br><br>  Advance payments are paid: <br><ul><li>  in the first quarter until April 25, </li><li>  in the first half of July until July 25, </li><li>  9 months before October 25th. </li></ul><br>  Advance payment on the simplified taxation system, as well as the tax, can be completely reduced by the insurance premiums paid to SPs paid in the same period. <br><br>  <strong>Council</strong>  If income is available, we recommend paying insurance premiums not in a single amount at the end of the year, but in parts until the end of each quarter.  In this case, if the advance payment or tax is less than the contributions paid, it is not necessary to pay it. <br><br>  Advance payment is calculated by the formula: <br><br>  AP = D * 6% - NE, where <br><ul><li>  AP is an advance payment for the first quarter, half year or 9 months, </li><li>  D is the income for this period. </li><li>  SV - this insurance premiums PI, paid in this period. </li></ul><br>  For example, if the incomes of individual entrepreneurs from the beginning of the year to September 30 were 800,000 rubles  and he paid insurance premiums in the amount of 20,000 rubles, then the amount of the advance payment for 9 months will be equal to 28,000 rubles: <br><br>  AP = 800,000 * 6% - 20,000 = 28,000. <br><br>  <strong>VAT tax</strong> <br><br>  The tax on the simplified tax system is calculated in the same way as an advance payment, and is paid until April 30. <br><br>  <strong>How to pay advance payment and tax on the simplified tax system</strong> <br><br>  Advance payment and tax on the simplified taxation system can be paid from the current account of the individual entrepreneur, according to the receipt in any branch of Sberbank or via the Internet.  You can generate a receipt for cash payment or pay via the Internet <a href="https://service.nalog.ru/">on the tax website</a> . <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">CSC for the payment of an advance payment and tax on the USN</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  182 1 05 01011 01 1000 110 <br><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Reporting </h4><br>  Entrepreneurs in the simplified taxation system are obliged to keep a book on the accounting of income and expenses and submit a tax return once a year. <br><br>  <strong>Book of income and expenses</strong> <br><br>  The book of income and expenses (KUDIR) is issued for each calendar year.

With employees, individual entrepreneurs have additional responsibilities for registering in funds as an employer, for paying insurance premiums for employees and for submitting reports to the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation and the Social Insurance Fund.  In addition, the advance payment and the tax on the simplified tax system can be reduced to insurance premiums paid for themselves and for employees, but not more than 50%. <br><br>  Thanks for the help in writing the article <a href="http://nebopro.ru/">online accounting "Sky"</a> .
