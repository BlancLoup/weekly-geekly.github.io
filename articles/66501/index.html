  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Winning work stress</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Is the burden heavy </h3><br>  Every programmer, especially a team member, is stressed during his work day.  Coordination of documents, unexpected bugs, deadlines, meetings - as many sources of stress.  The ability to cope with the load, the pressure is very important for human health.  Stress destroys the body.  I know a man who, by the age of 50, was a complete wreck, because he was not working at the director‚Äôs place and could not cope with all the stress.  Inability to manage stress leads to <s>schizophrenia,</s> psychological problems, <s>fatness,</s> overweight, depression, back pain (muscles are pinched), but this is all a little flower, because after several years, stress can destroy internal organs, cause cancer or, as often happens, multiple heart attack .  Therefore, do not underestimate the ability to cope with the loads, stress, psychological pressure. <br><br>  So what can you do. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Hobby </h3><br>  Doing some pleasant work that does not require coordination of the TK and the achievement of the result is an excellent stress therapy.  You can draw, make ships, cut furniture.  Own creations soothe and tune in a peaceful mood.  This is like children's affairs, when we went to catch lizards or throw snowballs.  The result was not special, the most important was the process.  From the point of view of an adult person, it would seem that senseless things and stupid burning of time, but, however, a very useful exercise for the soul and body.  People who have a hobby (for example, hunting or fishing) usually have a steady self-esteem, are calm and tolerant of others.  It seems that they have found harmony.  Perhaps in some sense it is. <br><br><h3>  Meditation </h3><br>  You can do meditation by the rules of yoga.  Yoga classes and taiji generally have a great effect on the body, if you practice every day and for at least a couple of years.  But you can meditate and in the city - on the fountain, for example.  We are looking for a fountain, sit opposite it and ... relax.  Water that always runs in a new way does not allow thoughts to come to mind and gradually the brain relaxes more and more.  We sit for half an hour and that's good!  In general, the main point in relaxing the brain and body.

    <h3>  Laughter and positive </h3><br>  Laughter is an excellent medicine, because it expels all negative thoughts.  In addition, during a laugh, any man can legally cry, and this is mega-useful!  Often we have to take risks.  To think what will happen in case of failure is necessary.  But not for long.  Success time, failure hour!  But often people can't get rid of negative thoughts.  Here it is necessary to understand whether this is caused by insufficient study of the ‚Äúways of retreat‚Äù, or by suspiciousness and not the ability to control oneself.  In any case, the negative feeds on your energy that you could spend on your loved ones. <br><br><h3>  Sleep </h3><br>  Sleep is another best medicine.  Can not sleep?  Eat glycine.  Give up 5 cups of coffee a day.  From tablets with ginseng.  Sit until late, set the alarm!  One remembers from the General Staff in the Second World War he sat up late (although Stalin hinted to take care of him), so he once had a heart and only by miracle did he escape (he managed to throw himself out of the window).  So if you're the boss, then punish the sleepy subordinates ... or make them take the BS.  Sleep in the workplace is a crime?  I do not think so.  At three o'clock I just need 15 minutes of sleep.  I will sleep either in my chair, or in the toilet, or else I will find a place somewhere else.  IMHO, there is nothing special about this, it is useful for you and for work. <br><br><h3>  Murder </h3><br>  Man is an animal ... curbed by the will of the mind.  Think about how often you want to kill in a day, or it seems to you that they will eat you (drop sociality).  Therefore, it is so good for a person in the shooting range where you can shoot from a firearm.  There you can kill all your enemies.  Cold steel, a platoon of a lock, we press a cock, broads - a categorical, ultimatous hole in a cardboard.  Another mega-useful thing is a boxing bag.  Japanese out in the offices set.  If you have never been beaten, then try at first slowly, lightly.  You will see that in 10-20 seconds you will begin to thrash ohoho how.  This is an incredibly enlivening, awakening and cleansing feeling when you hit something soft with all your strength until you get tired and a bit more.  I would put it in all offices. <br><br><h3>  Nature </h3><br>  Breed is an absolute beauty, so when a person looks at trees, leaves, flowers, grass, he feels well.  Nature is natural, it relaxes, takes away alluvial thoughts, restores animal power.  But mind you not to drink.  Alcohol is the enemy of relaxation! <br><br><h3>  Health therapy </h3><br>  Massage and aromatherapy.  What can I say.  A good massage will raise and the corpse.  Good aromatherapy will change black to white.  It is worth remembering about this more often. <br><br><h3>  Physical Education </h3><br>  What is good, for example, rocking.  Yes, swing, try an hour, smack all these metals - there such a grown up of hormones happens that Mama do not grieve.  After rocking any stress pofik.  In general, all pofik, you go like a tank, testosterone even spit.  And he just helps keep big loads.  So you want to raise your level - go in for physical exercise.  Here you need to decide when to engage.  Many people do not like after work, because it is difficult to concentrate, many people like it.  Try morning or midnight. <br><br><h3>  Feng Shui </h3><br>  The most important rule of Feng Shui - do not dump.  Let everything lie in its place, everything is put in order, then the energy will circulate through the house without delay.  But the house is almost the same as your body.  Make your workplace cozy, bring a flower or put on figures of your favorite characters.  Let it be your territory.  Houses can be annoying arrangement of furniture.  Do not tolerate, you need to rearrange.  Plus, it's fun. <br><br><h3>  Dancing </h3><br>  Dancing through the night.  The favorite occupation of girls.  We guys also dance, if we brought in a nightclub.  You don‚Äôt need to dance using learned movements, this is nonsense, we‚Äôre not on stage.  If a bad mood or just a breakdown, then start to move as your body wants.  Let it look like the death of the "controller" of the Stalker, then what do you care?  Follow the desires of the body and change the dance according to them.  Gradually, he will come to the usual fun and exciting.  The clock will dance like this and now it is alive, refreshed, restored, positively charged.  Where is the stress?  He is not here. <br><br><h3>  Gardening </h3><br>  To improve health, it is useful to meditate on a stone, to imagine oneself a stone, to touch a stone.  Respectively, working with the earth, health increases.  People died from stress and went to the garden to grow roses or tomatoes, and this saved them.  This is a hobby, that is a pleasant process for yourself, as you like, and communication with nature and work with mother Earth. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  We need to do a lot of things every day, all the time we run somewhere and do not have time, constantly need to be focused, we need to filter out a huge pile of information.  To be able to relax, to be able to rest, to be able to recover is critically important for a successful life in modern society, especially for people of mental labor.  I hope at least one of the tips will be useful for you, which is already good, and on the basis of it you will be able to build your relaxation strategy. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66501/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66501/</a></p>
