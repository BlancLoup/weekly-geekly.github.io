      Remember, when was the last time you had the last effort to prove the advantages of an architectural solution, but did not succeed?  Or, when with triumph you introduced at first glance an absolutely right decision, which suffered a complete fiasco afterwards.  Such moments give rise to a number of fair questions: ‚ÄúWhat did I do wrong?  How to correctly and logically present your point of view?  What is the difference and where is the line between conscious and reasonable architectural solutions and amateurish approach? ‚Äù <br><br>  This training is about common sense - about the validity of engineering solutions in conditions of uncertainty.  We will analyze what engineering solutions depend on and learn how to clearly substantiate them.  Let us think about what should be the expectations of architecture and whether you even have it in your project.  We will learn to solve engineering conflicts objectively, and you will forget the word "holivar" forever.  We take a completely new look at design patterns and now squeeze the maximum out of them.  Let us understand how to efficiently build documentation for the system so that it really starts working, and not ‚Äúwrite-only‚Äù.  Let's learn how to focus in our decisions and finally find out where to start - with the database schema or ‚Äúconcurrency design‚Äù.  And one of the most important things of the training is to learn not to do extra work. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Agile Mindset training program in system design</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><ul><li>  Posing problems </li><li>  Acquaintance and problem collection of participants </li><li>  Training Review </li><li>  Team breakdown </li><li>  Why architecture is needed - how not to ruin the project </li><li>  What is architecture? </li><li>  Where is the boundary of micro design and architecture? </li><li>  Who is the consumer of architectural artifacts? </li><li>  What answers should the chosen architecture answer? </li><li>  Architecture as a risk plan - to compensate for the uncertainty of the future </li><li>  What sources of project risk can we identify? </li><li>  How can early risks address external risks in their architecture? </li><li>  How can early risks address internal risks in your architecture? </li><li>  The boundaries of the system and how to fix them </li><li>  Architecture as a project plan - to increase production efficiency </li><li>  What are the requirements for the PM / RP architecture? </li><li>  How can you create a project plan for the architecture? </li><li>  Is the critical path visible? </li><li>  How to parallelize the work? </li><li>  Architecture as Component Requirements ‚Äî Provide Flexibility and Reduce Support Costs </li><li>  What assumptions do we rely on when designing with the use of off-the-shelf components or external systems? </li><li>  How can we formulate our expectations from external components? </li><li>  How to address the risks of non-compliance with our expectations? </li><li>  Requirements for architecture: the beginning of the checklist - what not to forget and not to miss </li><li>  Architectural methodology - how to make engineering decisions in favor of business needs and make decisions transparent for business </li><li>  What are the decisions in design and architecture?

His experience allows him to be an architect in the development of large commercial systems, while he is able to convey complex technological knowledge to the widest range. <br><br>  <i>A few simple questions regarding the potential and incentive to participate in the training, Evgeny Krivosheev:</i> <br><br>  <b>- Yevgeny, who is the target audience of engineering trainings for Agile Mindset in general, which specialists will draw from it the maximum possible?</b> <br><blockquote>  Our trainings are designed for medium (regular) developers and more well-trained specialists. <br><br>  Younger developers may also be interested in training, but after becoming familiar with the basics of Agile.  The second training, which is no longer dedicated to architectures, but to specific processes and business models, is likely to be complicated for a junior, since it is intended not even for senior developers, but for architects and PM's with development experience. <br><br>  Anyway, the essence of the two trainings lies precisely in the establishment of ‚Äúcross-cutting‚Äù rules for developers, architects, project managers, resource managers, product managers, and even, perhaps, owners.  This is done to obtain a single model of decision making. <br><br>  The goal is also to ensure that the engineering helps the business, and does not interfere.  She helped develop, earn more money and solve other tasks: reducing delivery time (time-to-market), increasing its predictability and improving the quality of the system. <br>  For this, it is critically important that the engineers hear the business, and the business readily answers the questions of the engineers. <br><br>  How exactly to make engineering decisions?  How to build architecture?  How to communicate?  These questions are designed to answer and help find solutions to both training. </blockquote><br>  <b>- What practical skills or techniques can be mastered during the training?</b> <br><blockquote>  The most important thing is communication skills.  During the training, we learn to communicate in a single language and understand what other roles are guided by in the process of architectural design.  Most of the problems of software engineering, in our opinion, rests primarily in communication: they don‚Äôt hear each other‚Äôs roles, operate with different concepts, do not go beyond the ‚Äúoperating walls‚Äù. <br><br>  The second skill is a specific set of techniques and patterns of system design.  These skills can be process and engineering. <br><br>  How to build work and architecture in a constantly changing flow of requirements?  This requires methodological support (what?) And specific engineering solutions (how?) </blockquote><br>  <b>- Why is Agile Mindset as ‚Äúmind set‚Äù, and how does this setup help in designing large-scale architectures?</b> <br><blockquote>  This whole slice of the real world is divided into two rather large parts: the world of formal or sequential methodologies and processes and the world of flexible methodologies and processes (fewer formal initial settings, more reaction to what is happening in real time). <br><br>  The benefit for the participants is expressed in the following metaphor: ‚ÄúFinally, tasks will be done!‚Äù.  Formal and sequential approaches imply a large feedback loop - between the idea and implementation a lot of time passes, many forces are spent on communication and overcoming various barriers: bureaucratic, communication, and possibly organizational. <br>  What is important in the world of flexible methodologies?  A relatively small feedback loop with the developer.  The employee sees that the result of his work is quickly introduced and contributes to the positive motivation of the whole team. </blockquote><br>  Come and introduce common sense in your company! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294190/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294190/</a></p>
