Most often, customers are interested in the following fundamental points. <br>  Which sites belong to online shopping? <br>  How many functions in stores of this type are considered optimal? <br>  What is most significant in general store management? <br>  What qualifications should have the one who will manage the store? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, consider the answers to these and related questions. <br><br>  <b>What is the management process?</b> <br><br><br>  Shop management is the implementation of two main tasks: <br><ul><li>  preparation and publication of product information; <br></li><li>  the process of receiving and processing information about orders. <br></li></ul><br>  These tasks are performed either in online stores, or with the help of enterprise management systems.  This option requires the organization of the exchange of data on goods, orders and customers between the store on the Internet and the enterprise management system.  If the sites do not give an opportunity to solve one of these tasks, they are not referred to online stores.

    <br>  <strong>The preparatory stage and the process of publishing information about the goods in the online store.</strong> <br><br>  In various types of CMS models, the process of publishing product data can be performed by different methods and with different levels of detail.  The properties of the goods and the features of the trading process determine the methods for providing information about the goods in online stores. <br>  Retail, small assortment or new products in the online store. <br>  When a store sells novelties at a retail price, the properties of which are not known to the target audience of buyers, such products should have an accurate description with examples of use, pictures, video and audio clips.  To transfer information about products in the Internet shop, the best method would be to create pages with sections using means of a content management system. <br>  This method of publishing data about the product is quite flexible and the store administrator does not constrain any framework. <br>  Wholesale trade, a wide variety of assortment, familiar product. <br><br>  If the store has an audience orientation with professionals who are familiar with the properties of goods from Internet sources, if the variety of goods is wide enough (electronic components, components for computers, automotive spare parts, and so on), create sections on the site for a similar description of any Article, most likely not worth it.  It would be sufficient to give an example of the descriptions of groups of goods and producer companies that are competitors in any of the groups of goods.  Significant in such cases is the comfort of searching and selecting products based on its characteristics. <br><br>  In this variant, in order to provide information about a product, tables with several columns are most often used, each of which has information about the value of one or another parameter of the product.  In order to create storage and editing of tables containing information about products, databases are used that specialize in this, where, simply put, there is a separate card for any product in which a separate place must be reserved for any parameter characterizing the goods in the form of a field. <br><br>  <strong>Reception and processing of information about the order in the store.</strong> <br><br>  The most important task in managing an online store is to obtain information about the order placed in the store, completed in a timely and efficient manner.  It matters who ordered what.  Receiving information about the order more often carried out using a letter that sends the online store to the post office administrator. <br><br>  In the most simple Internet shops nothing more is provided.  This method of delivering information about the order to the administrator is only suitable for its availability.  At the same time he has a lot of negative points. <br>  It is no secret that Internet protocols of the postal type do not guarantee delivery of letters.  This can lead to loss of information about orders, which contributes to the loss of order and profit. <br>  The method of delivery by mail makes it more difficult to dispatch and distribute orders between administrators (managers), when the work of the store on the Internet is intensive. <br>  Mail delivery makes it more difficult to transfer data between the online store and the office part of enterprise management systems. <br><br>  <strong>The method and method of payment in the online store.</strong> <strong><br></strong> <br>  In order to most effectively organize the process of paying for purchases in the online store, today there is a huge list of a variety of innovative solutions.  <a href="http://paysto.ru/ru/products/onlineMerchant">OnlineMerchant</a> is considered to be one of the most popular, because with the help of this universal tool, when making a fixed payment in an online store, you can avoid wasting time and money on connecting certain types of payment, as well as on the accompanying collection of documents. <br><br>  Access to the store database on the Internet via the http protocol is the main method in connection with the mentioned disadvantages of obtaining information about the order.  Using http allows you to view and edit order information via the web interface and allows you to exchange information data between stores and the enterprise management system. <br>  A good method of delivering a notice that buyers placed an order inside the store is letters. <br>  Other methods of transmitting information and notification of orders are also possible, often for this purpose they use SMS to the mobile phone administrators or messages via ICQ and other similar systems. <br><br>  <strong>Who has the right to manage in the Internet shop?</strong> <br><br>  There are various opinions on the question of who has the right to manage an online store.  Sometimes there is a point of view that a specialist with special education, who is fluent in website creation technologies, is needed to manage the store. <br>  By analyzing the answers to the question of what is the management process in an online store, you can easily figure out who should manage it.  As already noted, there are two important tasks in managing a store: publishing product data, including cost, receiving and processing information about orders that are issued. <br>  It is likely that the solution of these management tasks must be provided to the merchandiser and the manager of companies owning stores on the Internet. <br>  They can certainly determine what, when, and at what cost they can and must be sold.  They certainly know how to process an order. <br>  Designers, layout designers, programmers and other engineering technology specialists, having fulfilled their duties at the time of creating the store on the Internet, should move aside, leaving the counters of the virtual world to trade professionals. <br>  It is likely that not all sites, even having a content management system, provide an opportunity to do so.  CMS, which forms the basis of the store on the Internet, should absolutely close all the ambiguities in the creation and filling from the manager and merchandiser.  Managing a store on the Internet should be no more difficult than the preparatory stage of documentation in an office application environment. <br>  Content management systems in modern times are designed so that users do not need to have special education and qualifications. <br>  In order to process photos, more often use the smallest feature set of photoshop.  To master these actions is easy, just read a book about this program. <br>  In the most accessible case, when the variety of the range of products is not very large, when there is more than one product name in one order and when the percentage of intensity of orders is not expected to be high, you can manage several pages with information about the goods. <br><br>  <strong>Without which sites do not belong to the shops?</strong> <br><br>  The main advantage is the possibility to take orders for goods of interest to buyers around the clock online.  All other tasks and functions necessarily follow from this. <br>  In simple cases, when the variety of the product range is not very large, when there is no more than one product name within a single order and when the percentage of order intensity is not expected to be large, you can manage several pages with information about the product. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216657/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216657/</a></p>
