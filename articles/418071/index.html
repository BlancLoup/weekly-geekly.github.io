  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IT industry for the people: TechTrain Festival in St. Petersburg</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello!  My boyfriend is a developer, and in the evenings, when he comes home from work, we have dinner together, and then we don‚Äôt go for a walk / to the cinema / to watch the bridges spread (summer is the same).  He sits down at the computer and saws something in his repository on the githaba, because "look, I have 4 months all green every day, finally!" But it's not scary, because at the weekend (if you are lucky with the weather) we are still ‚Äúgoing out‚Äù. <br><br>  This is what I?  Every day off is valuable, and therefore, when a meeting / conference falls on a Saturday or Sunday, one girl programmer is sad in the world. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Note:</b> I sometimes find myself this girl too.  And here again, September 1-2, <a href="https://techtrain.ru/">TechTrain</a> .  Is it a lost weekend? <br>  I submitted that I did not work in the JUG.ru Group.  What would I do at the festival? </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z0/g-/yh/z0g-yhyo6eh_xxtxoesg0bmfcfo.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So he buys TechTrain tickets and is going to go there on the last weekend of the summer.  Naturally, I was upset - I have nothing to do at the IT festival, because I don‚Äôt understand anything in the pipelines and distributed systems.  Desperate, I go to the festival website and see the first speaker ... Goblin.  The one that films on tape sounded.  I remember how, in early childhood, I learned from him about the word ‚Äúpadla‚Äù (I just watched the first Star Wars with Queen Amidala / Padme).  And here in front of me is a photo of Dmitry Puchkov and a <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/52prbxabpaeq00iew04iaa/">description of his report</a> : ‚Äúreconnaissance with one of the festival‚Äôs speakers‚Äù.  It seems not so scary.

      I went to read more.  Abdulmanov from Mosigry.  Who on Habr√© does not know <a href="https://habr.com/users/milfgard/" class="user_link">Milfgard</a> ?  I love his posts.  About Vladivostok so unexpectedly hooked - the atmosphere of the city itself is so transmitted, as if she had been there herself.  At the festival, <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/gxxyknwt04maassmgosou/">Sergey will talk</a> , of course, about games: action, intellectual and social games, gamification of real things, the first simple games of ancient cultures.  Nothing incomprehensible, everything is interesting, she would love to listen. <br><br>  What do Meryl Streep, Henry Ford and Albert Einstein have in common?  Denis Mishunov writes that all of them, despite their successes in professional life, suffered from various problems.  Denis <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/3gbfq0k49qo0mciegqik0q/">will</a> not <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/3gbfq0k49qo0mciegqik0q/">talk</a> about the development, but about the developers.  About perfectionism, processing and impostor syndrome.  According to the latter, by the way, I once passed the test.  It seems to suffer from time to time.  Again, interesting, too, would go to listen to the report.  And I thought that the festival is only for advanced IT specialists, and I definitely don‚Äôt have a place there. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhy dreaming is one of the most important skills.‚Äù  So, and why?  This is part of the title of the <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/zccpxmk3qwwko48sissa4/">report by Ivan Yamshchikov</a> about how artificial intelligence is changing education, business and society.  In the description of the report there is a good example about twin sisters who read the same number of books a month, while the first sister has shelves of unread books, and the second buys exactly as many books as she has time to read.  This example is an allusion to incredible amounts of information that we generate and do not have time to process.  Also, be sure to go listen. <br><br>  I also hooked up the <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/1v3xcaovfu4iqoykcmauwo/">report by Oleg Bartunov</a> about the path from a simple astronomer to a world-famous developer.  And, probably, would have listened to the <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/1lgixmgg3qw62iasomk6cu/">report of Roman Elizarov</a> ‚ÄúWhy do we need another programming language?‚Äù.  The first thing you think about, looking at the title of the report - really, why?  Is he needed?  He probably needs it, because Roman just works with Kotlin - he definitely has something to tell (and three years ago, Kotlin for me was just an island on which Kronstadt is located). <br><br>  Yes, not all reports were clear to me (not all, to be honest).  And in general, I thought TechTrain would be similar to other conferences of the JUG.ru Group that I hadn‚Äôt been taken to before (I still wouldn't understand anything).  And the festival, it turns out, is not only for IT people?  In general, if many reports are clear to me as well, why should an engineer with experience go to this festival?  I went to my ‚Äúengineer with experience‚Äù and started asking what he had forgotten about. <br><br>  The first report he noted was <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/1xs8tiirtycwgy0yeey2we/">about the architecture of a software product</a> from Mikhail Druzhinin.  He said that he would definitely listen, because everyone seems to be talking about architecture, but very few people can say something specific.  Again, if there is plenty of literature on other topics, then the most characteristic problems that lead to the very bad architecture, and the ways to solve them, are not written as much as we would like. <br><br>  Still, despite the fact that the guy is a javist, he occasionally still has to deal with the front.  And in general, it is interesting to find out what javaskripters are doing right now, so he said that he would definitely come to listen to the <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/20wi6w8v0qyeswemw4yyyy/">report of Ilya Klimov</a> - he will just ‚Äútake a walk‚Äù into the life of a modern JS developer.  But the <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/3po3pmunduumg4aoawiyqg/">report of Vitaly Friedman</a> , most likely, will not work - after all, it does not work with responsive user interfaces.  Although it would be nice to know how to save on airline tickets (I was already interested here!). <br><br>  Well, be sure to go listen to Yevgeny Borisov.  This time, not about Spring (but no one bothers to ask during the breaks), but <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/6sjdoyaktm2wyokguyoosk/">about Spark's capabilities</a> : how it works, what tasks it can perform, how to use it correctly. <br><br>  In total, there are 24 reports in the program, it is better not to tell all of them, it‚Äôs better <a href="https://techtrain.ru/talks/">to read on the site</a> . <br><br><h1>  Not a single report </h1><br>  ‚ÄúSo,‚Äù I thought, ‚Äúlet's say I found some interesting reports.  But the festival is going on for two days, what will I do for the rest of the time? ‚ÄùIf you search, you can still find something interesting.  Having dealt with a rather confusing site, I found the ‚ÄúExhibition‚Äù section, and the magic word ‚ÄúEntertainment‚Äù caught my eye. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bh/od/z8/bhodz8ba2dstfwot-brzselxh4k.jpeg"><br><br>  First of all, I would like to look at the interactive exhibition <a href="https://mozgpro.ru/">"The Brain: the Universe Within Us"</a> .  I never reached this exhibition with my feet, but now I can finally learn all the secrets and possibilities of the brain.  I hope the guys will bring cat ears, which can be controlled by the power of thought. <br><br>  There will also be nastolki from <a href="https://spb.mosigra.ru/">Mosigra</a> .  Everything is very difficult with my desktops: as long as I get into the rules of the game, while I remember all the nuances, all the enthusiasm and desire to play disappears (the guys who explained Munchkin's rules to me for an hour and a half, sorry!).  Therefore, it is so important for me that someone help me with all the instructions - after Abdulmanov's posts, I have no doubt that all the rules will be laid out for me, they will teach me everything and not throw in trouble.  After the festival I will not start programming, but I hope that I will become closer to the world of nastolk. <br><br>  I remember, by the way, how in childhood I loved to play table hockey.  It stopped only after the figures of the majority of the players finally fell off the mounts and the glue no longer saved (so often we played and thrashed the puck so hard).  Recently tried a kicker.  Of course, I do not play as often as I did in my childhood, but I <a href="https://vk.com/freefoos">‚Äôm happy</a> to <a href="https://vk.com/freefoos">see the</a> stand of <a href="https://vk.com/freefoos">FREEFOS</a> , in addition to the tables, they will also have a kicker workshop. <br><br>  Continuing the theme of childhood memories: the festival will <a href="https://vk.com/retrotechsquad">host an</a> exhibition of retrocomputers <a href="https://vk.com/retrotechsquad">RetroTech Squad</a> .  The guys were already on the Joker last year, brought a lot of retro games, and on TechTrain, too, you can indulge in nostalgia. <br><br>  Rubik's cube everyone can collect?  I have not learned this way (more precisely, a couple of times everything went with me, but that was a long time and not true).  <a href="https://speedcubes.ru/">Speedcubes</a> will show a master class for the assembly of the cube (here it is, my chance to regain my former greatness), and also hold a speed assembly tournament - it's time to prove yourself. <br><br>  The festival will also come <a href="https://sintezevent.ru/">Sintez Event</a> , to immerse us all in the world of virtual reality. <br><br><h1>  Communities </h1><br>  While I am presenting how I collect the Rubik's Cube and study virtual reality in the time left after the reports, my boyfriend thinks which communities he will go to (what‚Äôs already about 20 on their website).  Both days of the festival, the guys will hold mitapes, draws, master classes on their stands, and specifically for their reports two separate tracks in two halls are allocated.  24 reports for two days.  In addition to the main halls, there will also be a demo zone at the exhibition - a small stage for those community reports that were not included in the main tracks.  Schedule can be viewed on the site closer to the dates of the festival. <br><br>  So, on TechTrain already go: <br><br><p><img width="100" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/h8/0m/t6/h80mt6wbs9acaaocrzofmczktjg.png">  <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ru-RU/Golang-Peter/">Golang Peter</a> - Meetings of the Russian-speaking developer community on Go.
