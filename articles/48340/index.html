      The build is currently distributed only in 32bit mode in English.  In general, not so much that hyper-unpleasantness, but still a factor when the question is about the car about the home working OSes. <br><br>  Recently I read about the fact that they say - "huge taskbar!".  Guys, this is all bullshit!  :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d4b/581/01e/d4b58101ed68db5d49a90afeb2f0908f.gif" alt="Taskbar in original condition"><br>  This is the initial state. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a11/2e9/7ca/a112e97ca5f4fe133dd682421573e712.gif" alt="Taskbar setup menu"><br>  There is a magic window that allows you to fix problems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a27/8f1/1f1/a278f11f1799f1515395f59495d3daf1.gif" alt="More compact"><br>  ... and turn into a more compact look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/51c/cfb/2fe/51ccfb2fe7009cae685e55eabf6a2280.gif" alt="Retro"><br>  And even in general, in a kind recognizable by all. <br><br>  Otherwise, in my work I ran into some glitches with the explorer (there were circumstances when it was just overloaded). <br>  Small errors in the work of the tray, but it did not bother at all.  And a couple of times the processor was busy with some kind of host process, not responding to the callsign. <br><br>  Basically, most software will work just like in whist.  Problems begin with when it comes to extended administrative access to system folders, to various rights, when working with various computer devices. <br><br>  So for example virtual drives.  Initially, it is clear that the STPD driver in W7 is yours.  Therefore, working with Daemon Tools has disappeared by itself for some time.  They said that ‚ÄúVirtualCloneDrive‚Äù from ‚ÄúElaborate Bytes‚Äù will save.  Saves.  But not until the end.  Not all images are normally mounted in this program.  So for example, there are problems with MS Office 2007 images. <br><br>  Images are mounted with some incredible delay.  If they do not want to register in the system. <br><br>  Modern games will work.  And work.  But all modern security systems are not.  So for example - starfors.  No solution has been found yet.  In online games - Punk Baster.  It works, but crashes with an error (Unknown Windows API function [131131] ... [131137]). <br><br>  Third party firewalls are the same.  Compatibility under the wild question.  Antiviruses - I don‚Äôt know and for now I‚Äôm afraid even to install. <br>  Webmoney Keeper Classic - there is no possibility to regain control of the wallet from under Windows 7. The problem is that the program opens the possibility to access its interface locally via the HTTP protocol, but these attempts in W7 are stopped.  And so far no solution has been found. <br><br>  Otherwise, everything is stable.  There are no blue screens.  Basic applications and work has become faster.  Very quickly, the memory occupied by applications is released.  Unlike Vista, there are no serious delays when switching tasks during the absence of free RAM resources. <br><br>  The overall increase in productivity is significant and well felt. <br><br>  Although the work itself is too early to say.  All the same beta.  Stable, but not confident.  Those who want to put this as the main operating system should think about - is it worth it?  :) My personal verdict - it is worth waiting for versions, when there will be support for all the programs that are used in Vista at the moment. <br><br>  <b>upd</b> <br>  Webmoney Keeper Classic works. <br>  Apparently I had a special case.  I apologize for the misinformation. <br><br>  <b>upd 2</b> <br>  Concerning problems with virtual drives.  No problem.  Thanks <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/auren/" class="user_link">Auren</a> for the tip.  Office 2007 put copied from the image on the screw.  But put a very long time.  Before the start of the installation, I thought for 10-15 minutes. <br><br>  <b>upd 3</b> <br>  Antivirus work.  KIS 2009, KAV 2009, NOD32 2.7, ESET Smart Security, Avira Antivir, AVG 8.0, Avast!, Judging by the comment, the hack-readers work without any special problems. <br><br>  Komodo Firewall works as a firewall. <br><br>  There are already some "lists" of software that works fine on the seven, so before you get scared, for more confidence, see the links: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/software/92-free-great-programs-window-7-a.html">FREE Great Programs for Window 7</a> (thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/nzea/" class="user_link">NZea</a> ) </li></ul><br><br>  <b>upd 4</b> <br>  The official response of PunkBuster support to errors in work in Windows 7: <br>  08/01/2009 02:44:04 - ‚ÄúAdam Dunahoe‚Äù <br>  Note # 2: It is not supporting Windows 7, it is not supporting Windows 7.  I‚Äôm sorry, but I‚Äôm not able to support beta or release candidate operating systems.  (Both the PB and we will not support Windows 7 until it goes on sale. We apologize, but we do not support the beta and release candidates of operating systems) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48340/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48340/</a></p>
