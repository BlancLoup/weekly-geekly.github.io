  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Modern city as an operating system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's no secret for anyone that the line between offline and online is gradually disappearing, digital technologies are penetrating deeper and deeper into our physical world.  Food and daily demand are tracked using an RFID tag.  Traffic in the city, energy, plumbing and communication systems are driven by intelligent technology.  Cities are equipped with a growing number of interconnected special devices that make them more ‚Äúreasonable."  This convergence changes the look of modern infrastructure, and, at the same time, provides new opportunities for integrating the things that surround us with hardware and software. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, we are still far from the fact that ‚Äúsmart‚Äù cars, houses or cities from science fiction films become our reality.  But the technologies for this are being worked out now, and many of the types of businesses are already actively using them.  It was in this vein in Las Vegas at the end of February this year the third IBM Pulse 2010 conference was held, where the main topic was the creation of smart buildings, offices and urban infrastructure. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cd/c41/056/5cdc410560def4ccfb1d73995b26c03b.gif" alt="image"><br>  At the conference, IBM representatives spoke about their experience in developing and implementing systems that integrate the physical and digital worlds, as well as their experience in building intelligent infrastructures for buildings.  Partners from the non-IT business were presented, together with which IBM is developing its initiatives.  For example, together with Johnson Controls, tools are being developed to optimize energy consumption and improve the safety and comfort of buildings. <br><br>  The event was also told about products that help customers create unified command centers not only for data processing, but also for managing water supply systems, office equipment, door locks, heating and fire systems ... We have already written about one of these products - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ibm/blog/76087/">IBM Maximo</a> in our blog.  During the Pulse 2010 conference, a new solution based on IBM Global Business Services and IBM Maximo Asset Management was presented to manage a whole portfolio of objects from one place - Property Portfolio Management (you can read more <a href="http://www-935.ibm.com/.../maximo_property_performance_mgmt_solution_brief.pdf">here</a> ).  They also talked about the use of a number of IBM Tivoli products (Open Process Automation Library (OPAL), Provisioning Manager, Security Manager, Storage Manager, Fastback and Fastback) for creating and developing intelligent systems. <br><br>  The entire conference was held under the sign of energy saving and resource conservation, since these processes are interconnected and flow from one another.  According to IBM Vice President Richie Lechner, smart buildings are the key to the city‚Äôs economic and environmental sustainability.  In this case, the city is positioned as a new operating system.  This approach lies at the heart of the IBM Smart Planet global initiative ‚Äî a sensible planet where all parts, such as cities, universities, corporations, and even buildings, are not fragmented, but closely interconnected and are perceived as a single whole ‚Äî and that whole will fight with environmental problems, and with problems of energy and resource saving, and with problems of excessive and unreasonable expenses of business.

      The Pulse 2010 conference showed that ‚Äúsmart‚Äù technologies are not the subject of the future, they already exist, they are being actively implemented and are developing very quickly.  And through the use of new technologies comes the understanding and support of the Smart Planet initiative to solve global problems. <br><br>  Useful links: <a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/tivoli/pulse/">IBM Pulse 2010 conference site</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87684/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87684/</a></p>
