New updates are coming out, new algorithms and approaches are being developed.  This is an endless process.  In 2014, according to Moz's statistics, Google released 13 updates, not counting the daily updated nuances that are not available to the general public. <br><br>  My company, Market Domination Media, is constantly striving to improve customer marketing strategies.  We decided to get together and discuss the main trends in the SEO world for 2015, highlighting <b>6 key accents.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Increase and optimize mobile traffic.</b> 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      Back in 2012, ComScore predicted that traffic from mobile devices would exceed computer traffic by 2014.  So it happened.  Google claims to bring up search sites that are suitable for tablets, smartphones, and PC users (‚Äúmobile-friendly sites‚Äù). <br>  PS: analysis of your site by the above criteria can be done <b><a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/mobile-friendly/">here</a></b> . <br><br>  <b>2. Focused on unpopular search engines Bing, Yahoo, DDG and others.</b> <br><br>  Every year we are very likely to assume the collapse of search giants, but this does not happen.  Although, the likelihood that competitors will be able to ‚Äúchop off‚Äù a piece of cake is great.  Firefox changed the default search engine from Google to Yahoo, which greatly influenced the growth rate of the giant's popularity.  Safari may also follow suit by switching to Bing or Yahoo.  Maybe this is not the beginning of the collapse, but a small step back - definitely. <br><br>  <b>3. Changing the SEO rating system in favor of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9">ROI</a> .</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  If your company still evaluates the success of a marketing campaign for ranking its positions based on key requests, then the time has come for serious changes!  Some companies find it easier to promote any query just for the phrase <i>‚Äúhey, we are in the first place in the search results!‚Äù</i> But ... <br>  What do you think is better to hear your boss making a big SEO investment every month? <br>  a) Hooray!  We are in the first place for the search query ‚Äúbuy blue mobiles‚Äù, but pegging to profit is impossible. <br>  b) The above infographic shows that 50 people recruited from the search engine ordered 45 products, totaling $ <b>22,000</b> . <br><br>  I think the answer is obvious.  The PDF report on keyword positions is not as interesting as the amount of SEO revenue. <br><br>  <b>4. Purposeful work with social networks.</b> <br><br>  Social networks were conceived as a platform for the exchange of information.  Many companies consider it necessary to register on each of them, and then deal with throwing tons of spam from each page.  But do not forget that for the user it should be the same useful resource as the support service of the company.  And if a client wants to communicate on a personal level through social networks, his desire must be satisfied. <br><br>  An effective manager will focus on several, the most attractive sites.  Do not scatter the force on all.  And further, it will offer all kinds of services with the receipt of specific responses from the target audience.  This will help to form a core, to get stable and loyal followers.  After all, each of their repost is an indicator of the level of trust. <br><br>  <b>5. Building up job references, not building ones.</b> <br><br>  Links should "attract", and not build an artificial authority.  They still work, but only those that meet search engine algorithms are very effective.  A donor site with one link is more effective than a hundred, but spammed with ads and flash applications.  The times of growth of links from non-thematic blogs are long gone, so pay great attention to the specialization of donor sites.  PR and SEO are a tandem, not two different business lines. <br><br>  <b>6. Keyword targeting.</b> <br><br>  The times of extensive targeting are coming to an end.  It would not be desirable to become on the 1st place by the request ‚Äúrepair of telephones‚Äù, it is practically impossible, and it will not give the desired result.  Users become smarter, their wishes are concretized.  Few people write ‚Äúbuy an iPhone‚Äù, many indicate a specific model, color.  All this is a key audience that search engines ‚Äúdrive‚Äù to the site that is most focused on it. <br><br>  Long requests attract the largest number of potential consumers of services.  And the competition there is lower than in the general keywords.  Understand the train of thought of the buyer to satisfy his desires.  Focus on organic traffic, become the pointer that will send all this flow to your resource. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286020/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286020/</a></p>
