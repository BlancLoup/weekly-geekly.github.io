View from the past events of 2007.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  They often say: ‚ÄúThere in the future ...‚Äù or ‚ÄúBut after 100 years!‚Äù ... Meanwhile, the future is no longer just here, but already in the past!  Just look at the recent events that took place in High Tech`a last year in 2007: transparent materials based on nano technologies, new data processing and storage technologies, as well as record transfer speeds.  Cyborgization of mankind unfolded in full swing. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Wake up, Neo. </h2><br>  About six months ago, there was news that the US plans to develop an interactive model of the planet of the earth, with all that it implies.  But this is more likely not even a model of the Earth, but a ‚Äúvirtual copy of life on Earth‚Äù, otherwise it should not be called.  The Ministry of Defense DOD (Department of Defense) of the USA is developing a ‚Äúparallel planet Earth‚Äù with billions of individualized nodes (nodes) depicting each man, woman, and child on this side of the line dividing reality and ‚Äúartificial reality‚Äù. <br><br>  This model is called SWS (Sentient World Simulation or "Simulation of the Conscious World").  It is intended to become ‚Äúa synthetic reflection of the real world with automatic constant adjustment in accordance with current information about what is happening in this real world‚Äù - this is written in the project description. <br>  SWS is an environment for testing "psychological operations" (PSYOP), the document says, so that military leaders can "develop and test different strategies, and anticipate and actively shape the behavior of opponents, neutral parties and partners." <br>  ‚ÄúThe idea is to generate alternative scenarios for the future as a result of possible interaction between many parties,‚Äù said Alok Chaturvedi, a professor at Purdue University, co-author of the conceptual project SWS.  He also created a commercial version of this platform, which is sold by Simulex Inc. <br><br>  SWS also copies financial institutions, the media, utilities and trade infrastructure.  Its developers believe that the application of economic theory and psychology allows them to predict how the human masses will react to various stresses.

      Well, how?  Scary not?  Doesn't it look like a 13th floor movie? <br><br>  This is what awaits us in the near future, but few people know that such systems are functioning and developing now: for example, SEAS is a program to simulate crises in the US, and the development of the Iraqi campaign is modeled in it for a period of eight years! <br><br>  You can read a little more about this in the article <a href="http://webplanet.ru/news/research/2007/06/27/clones.html">Military test future wars on virtual clones</a> or view a presentation on the website of the US <a href="https://www.dmso.mil/Fpublic/dmsc_presentations">Defense</a> Ministry <a href="https://www.dmso.mil/Fpublic/dmsc_presentations">Defense Modeling and Simulation Office</a> <br><br>  So ... Matrix has you, Neo. <br><br><h2>  Johnny Mnemonic </h2><br>  Recently, a message slipped through the news feeds: ‚ÄúEuropean scientists are working on creating a virtual world for people with disabilities and have actually finished work on the first stage of this world, whose characters can be controlled by mental teams.  Such systems are designed for paralyzed people, for whom life and communication in the virtual world will help to once again feel the movement and replace the real life.  Meanwhile, experts are confident that such systems will find application in areas of the economy that are far from medicine. ‚Äù <br><br>  The essence of the system is a complete emulation of the surrounding world, i.e.  the patient is wearing a helmet that removes the activity of the patient‚Äôs brain and, based on mental commands, allows him to make movements in the virtual room and, through all the same mental recruitment, to communicate in a text chat with other people.  In addition, the developers promise to provide patients with access to various game universes like SecondLife, etc. <br><h2>  Best real-time strategy in the world!  Coming soon. </h2><br>  The US Department of Defense funded the development of chips that were introduced into the brain by US Army soldiers, in order to monitor their "performance".  That is, in words the officer will see on the laptop screen information about the level of glucose and cholesterol in the blood of each soldier.  Each officer will see how many percent of health each fighter has left and more effectively build a combat plan ... <br><br>  Here we are.  Soon they will run around Iraq, fighting with terrorists, and look for first-aid kits, armor ... Doesn't it remind you anything? <br><br><h2>  And chanterelles took matches ... </h2><br>  An excerpt from the news feed: ‚ÄúAccording to the Associated Press, an unexpected discovery was made by a university physician, John Kanzius, at an attempt to desalinate seawater using a radio frequency generator developed by him for the treatment of tumors.  The sea water suddenly caught fire. ‚Äù <br>  The essence of the process of burning salt water was relatively clear.  Under the action of electromagnetic radiation, hydrogen and oxygen are released.  Under certain conditions, the released hydrogen "burns" in air and oxygen, leaving behind all the same water. <br>  The fact that this has not gone unnoticed by the Pentagon is not worth thinking.  The development of this idea is already interested. <br><h2>  Google trail </h2><br>  Not so long ago, in <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/alizar/" class="user_link">Habr√©, alizar</a> published a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/community_life/30825.html">post</a> about a new revolutionary service <a href="https://www.23andme.com/">23andme</a> : in this social network, users can search for unknown relatives and identify common ancestors right up to the Stone Age by genetic code.  Each 23andMe site visitor can order a special device for taking genetic material.  The sample is sent to the laboratory.  There is an analysis of the material, and all information comes to the personal genome account on the site 23andMe. <br>  <b>And what awaits us further?</b> <br><br>  EOF </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19042/</a></p>
