So, it was found out that about half of the respondents, instead of going to the store, would turn to Internet sites, and 35% of respondents decided to choose a smartphone as a gift. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/266536/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e83/841/908/e838419086104a6a87710a77501814f1.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Why did we remember this study?  Yes, because winter is near, and if you are from that half of people who prefer to shop online, then the question of buying gifts can begin to be addressed now.  Especially for those who are not indifferent to interesting technical things, we have chosen 10 unusual gifts for the New Year, which are likely to attract both geeks and their loved ones. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Tablet Teclast X2 Pro </h2><br>  Price for GearBest: <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/teclast-x2-pro-_gear%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">from $ 350</a> , depending on configuration

      Specifications: <br><br><ul><li>  Display: IPS 11.5 ", 1920 x 1080 pixels; </li><li>  CPU: Intel Core M 5Y10C 64bit Dual Core 800MHz; </li><li>  GPU: Intel HD Graphics 5300; </li><li>  ROM: 4 GB; </li><li>  Battery: 10,000 mAh, 3.7V; </li><li>  Memory: 64 GB, TF-cards up to 128 GB, NGFF-slot for SSD up to 128 GB; </li><li>  Main camera: 5 MP; </li><li>  Front camera: 2 MP; </li></ul><br>  Teclast X2 Pro is a powerful tablet with computer ambitions, which in the press are often compared with Microsoft Surface-devices.  Similar to the tablet and the well-known series of tablet laptops is really enough: Windows 10 as the operating system, the ability to connect the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_252594.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">keyboard</a> and control the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/tablet-pcs/pp_252590.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">stylus</a> , as well as a similar hardware architecture "stuffing." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/826/496/203/826496203ea846438a502c2e3ef2689e.jpg"><br><br>  The tablet is made of plastic with the use of metal on the rear panel, which, coupled with considerable dimensions (30.3 x 18.53 x 1.05 cm), increases the weight of the device to 0.84 kg.  The device can hardly be called suitable for mobile work.  But the hardware capabilities will quite allow the tablet to make some kind of spare working machine or home multimedia device.  In addition to relatively productive characteristics and the possibility of installing SSD-memory, the tablet has a set of slots: two full-sized USB 3.0, HDMI and a separate slot for charging. <br><br><h2>  ASUS RT-AC51U Router </h2><br>  GearBest price: <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/networking-communication/pp_244901.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">$ 39</a> with coupon GB51 <br><br>  Specifications: <br><br><ul><li>  Wireless standard: 802.11a / b / g / n / a, 2.4 / 5 GHz frequency; </li><li>  Maximum connection speed: 733 Mbit / s; </li><li>  Number of LAN ports: 4; </li><li>  Port speed: 100 Mb / s; </li><li>  USB connectors: 1xUSB 2.0 Type A; </li><li>  Antennas: 2 x 5dBi; </li></ul><br>  RT-AC51U is one of the most popular representatives of the line of successful routers from ASUS, one of the key features of which is support for the 802.11ac standard.  Earlier on GeekTimes published a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/213275/">review of a</a> more powerful model RT-AC68U.  Except for the number of antennas and speeds, the routers are identical. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b6/ffe/e5a/8b6ffee5aa8d4969806394f306b965ba.jpg"><br><br>  Of the nice features of the router, it is worth noting the support of Time Machine, which, coupled with the ability to connect USB drives directly to the device, allows you to back up your Mac OS device to an improvised cloud.  Also, the presence of USB-connector and ASUS AiCloud 2.0 will allow you to create a network storage for multimedia content or work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6e9/eb8/1f2/6e9eb81f2d174630bff43e4631f7e3ed.jpg"><br><br>  What is important - the device has a really beautiful design and high-quality materials.  Putting the router in a prominent place is not embarrassing, but hanging on the wall will not work because of the absence of the required opening in the case. <br><br><h2>  Compact 1080P Smart Camera </h2><br>  Price for GearBest: <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-cctv/pp_247466.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">$ 52.45</a> with minicam coupon <br><br>  Specifications: <br><br><ul><li>  Sensor: 12 megapixels; </li><li>  Viewing angle: 145 degrees; </li><li>  Video: 1080p; </li><li>  Photo: 1080p; </li><li>  Battery: 1000 mAh; </li><li>  Memory: TF card up to 32 GB. </li></ul><br>  Not so long ago, we <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/265180/">wrote a</a> post about several action cameras, many of which can be considered as potential alternatives to expensive GoPro.  Then we noted that if the camera is not designed for extreme situations, it is quite possible to confine ourselves to <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/action-cameras/pp_153556.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">Xiaomi Yi</a> .  If you simplify further, you can note the unusual and compact HD Smart camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/820/a8f/538/820a8f538fd6f03888737e0314269b4d.jpg"><br><br>  The camera weighs 30 grams and is enclosed in a cubic moisture-proof case with a side of 5 centimeters.  Instead of fastenings in the form of separate accessories, a stick and a magnet on the back side are used in the chamber.  This allows you to fix the device on different surfaces and, for example, allow you to use the camera as a DVR.  By the way, there are various recording modes for this, including time-lapse.  As for the control, a remote control is available from the box with the device, as well as a mobile application. <br><br><h2>  Mini-projector Unic UC50 DLP Projector </h2><br>  GearBest price: <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/projector/pp_238608.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">$ 108.26</a> with coupon GBUC50 <br><br>  Specifications: <br><br><ul><li>  Maximum resolution: 1080p; </li><li>  The dimensions of the projection diagonally: 35-170 cm; </li><li>  Projection distance: up to 400 cm; </li><li>  Aspect ratio: 4: 3/16: 9; </li><li>  Battery: 1500 mAh, 3.7V; </li><li>  Weight: 0.13 kg; </li><li>  Dimensions: 78x71x24.5 mm. </li></ul><br>  If we are talking about really compact devices, after the Smart camera you should tell about the Unic UC50 mini projector that fits in the palm of an average hand.  Of course, it makes no sense to compare the device with serious projectors, since the characteristics of the UC50 are in many respects inferior to budget stationary products. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ef/4eb/2c7/3ef4eb2c7568b3adf42c5a90fcc353f4.jpg"><br><br>  The peculiarity of this projector is portability.  It can work from a built-in battery or a charger, and an external USB-drive, TF-card, computer or mobile device acts as a source of projected material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/349/9ec/c4b/3499ecc4bad4eea71488f25703f4e6de.jpg"><br><br>  On the case of the device, in addition to the listed connectors, there is an HDMI input.  The control of the projector at the same time is carried out either from the standard remote in the kit, or by using the keys directly on the device. <br><br><h2>  MiPow PlayBulb Smart Bulb </h2><br>  GearBest price: <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-home/pp_216472.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">$ 39.99</a> with coupon BLT100 <br><br>  MiPlow PlayBulb is an unusual ‚Äúsmart‚Äù LED lamp and audio system in the form factor of the familiar E27 bulb.  In other words, if a curious user decides to repeat the trick with putting such a lamp in his mouth, then one can count on light and music while waiting for a doctor's appointment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e95/8e3/889/e958e38892f64c88ad81fbbdd56b5512.jpg"><br><br>  To manage the lamp is offered using a mobile application for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/playbulb/id733644808%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> or <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.mipow.androidplaybulb">Android</a> .  Here is an incomplete list of what becomes available after synchronizing the lamp with the device via Bluetooth: adjusting the degree of illumination, various timers for falling asleep, waking up or creating atmosphere, choosing lighting tones. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a18/0d7/d4f/a180d7d4f05f167885589e67e357cbef.jpg"></div><br>  The sound in the lamp is more likely to complement the calm atmosphere of warm lighting than to maintain the mood in a noisy company.  However, if you install several of these lamps, you can arrange an unusual disco. <br><br><h2>  Virtual reality glasses CST-09 </h2><br>  Price for GearBest: <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/virtual-reality/pp_242011.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">$ 22.59</a> <br><br>  If you are not a fan of collective viewing of various content, then, most likely, it is worth looking in the direction of CST-09 - virtual reality glasses, ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù suitable for reproducing 3D materials.  As with the other glasses, you also need an Android or iOS device (an application for these platforms is provided) with a diagonal of 3.5-5.7 inches. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/712/e2e/104/712e2e104e64705a5c9f15569cf57c3c.jpg"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c9e/2c6/a06/c9e2c6a06dd2982af48fc44876a6bece.jpg"></div><br>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãcontact of the face with glasses is made of soft material, and for individual convenience, the manufacturer has provided for adjusting the position of the lenses and their removal from the eyes. <br><br><h2>  Gamepad Gamesir G3 </h2><br>  Price on GearBest: <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/video-game/pp_257786.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">$ 19.40</a> <br><br>  Gamesir G3 is one of the most concise gamepads of the company with everything you need to synchronize with Android / iOS devices, PC and PS3 via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth.  The set for keys and sticks is similar to that in branded joysticks of the well-known PS3 console. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7e0/1a0/03a/7e01a003a07c56e176d3cdcbd372cb80.jpg"></div><br>  A long game promises a battery with a capacity of 600 mAh, which is charged from the USB-cable in the kit.  By the way, apart from the joystick itself, the manual and the cord, there is nothing with the device.  More advanced <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/video-game/pp_257788.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">version</a> costs $ 27.99 and comes with a convenient holder for mobile devices. <br><br><h2>  Gaming Mouse Luom G10 </h2><br>  Price for GearBest: <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/mice-keyboards/pp_254125.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">$ 18.35</a> <br><br>  The Luom G10 is a budget gaming mouse, which can be considered as an analogue of the RAT 7. With a well-known mouse, both the characteristics and capabilities and the futuristic design with the use of quality materials are similar.  So, the lower part of the mouse is made of aluminum, the top is made of matte plastic, and the 1.7-meter cable is in a fabric braid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4e/01e/fc0/d4e01efc0c2d4a74831739bc04c3d7d7.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b16/5e4/519/b165e45196274eaf81aacfd9da8bbed4.jpg"><br><br>  The mouse has 10 buttons, each of which is programmable in an understandable and convenient standard utility.  In addition, the program has the ability to customize the DPI (250 - 4000) with reference to the backlight of the mouse, which, by the way, looks very impressive in the dark. <br><br><h2>  Smart watch Honor Zero </h2><br>  Price for GearBest: <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_241271.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">$ 69.99</a> <br><br>  Honor - a sub-brand of the successful Chinese company Huawei, includes not only good <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/honor-_gear/c_11293%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">smartphones</a> , but also, for example, smart watches.  This is a budget accessory, where the key is not an abundance of functions, as in the Apple Watch or Android Wear devices, but a minimal design and various fitness opportunities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b83/932/605/b83932605a41474fb45458af69b7e8b4.jpg"><br><br>  Honor Zero will be a good gift for people leading an active lifestyle.  With the help of a smartphone application and clock sensors, it will be possible to track sleep phases, calories burned and distance traveled.  On top of that, the watch is protected by the IP68 standard, which will allow you to dive into the water without any risk to the device‚Äôs performance. <br><br><h2>  Sneakers LiNing with electronic filling </h2><br>  GearBest price: <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/home-smart-improvements/pp_264127.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">$ 44.04</a> with LNSHOE coupon <br><br>  Under the sport gadgets usually imply a variety of heart rate monitors, smart watches and other fitness bracelets.  In general, all those devices that are related to the sport only due to its electronic functions.  What can not be said about the production of LiNing - sneakers, according to the promises of the manufacturer, are not only convenient from an ergonomic point of view, but also include a set of electronic stuffing for tracking physical activity. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/150/f09/9fd/150f099fd9744141b4dedcf4c1072607.jpg"></div><br>  Famous Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi helped LiNing make smart sneakers from simple sneakers.  In addition to shoes in the box with the goods you can find a box with a chip that fits in a specially reserved place for him under the insole of the right shoe.  The chip itself is equipped with a Bluetooth sensor, which allows you to synchronize it with <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.xiaomi.hm.health%26hl%3Dru">Android</a> or <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/mi-fit/id938688461%3Fmt%3D8">iOS-</a> device, along with a proprietary application. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f2/da6/a92/2f2da6a923dd7630d61c6833fd492557.png"></div><br>  In fact, Mi Fit is a typical fitness app with goals, statistics, progress tracking and other features that are available, for example, in RunKeeper.  Only in this case, all changes depend on data from the sensor.  From the user is required only at the right time to synchronize. <br><br>  <b>Ps.</b>  By the way, Black Friday starts at the store - gift ideas can be viewed <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-black-friday-special-275.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">here</a> and <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-196.htm%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg15">here</a> .
