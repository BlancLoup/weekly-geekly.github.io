  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How NOT to write mailing letters</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I received a letter from the IEEE Northwest Section (as it happens, I am an IEEE member).  The letter surprised me with its content and design.  Since I often receive letters from organizations like IEEE, I have developed a certain pattern of how a letter should be written, which is sent to 300, 500, or 10 thousand people.  I really do not want to be showered with rotten tomatoes shouting ‚Äúpsol out, gram-Nazi‚Äù, however, I want to quote this letter and highlight particularly controversial places.  Before that, I would like to give some very simple and trivial advice to those who write mailing letters: <br><br>  1. Always read the letter slowly and completely before sending it. <br>  2. If in the process of re-reading you noticed and corrected several errors, be sure to follow step 1. <br>  3. Point 1 should be done as many times as the number of participants in the mailing list (ideally =).  Well, or at least from 1 to 3 times. <br>  4. Always use spell checkers.  Now available for free in all browsers. <br>  5. If a letter is sent to more than 300m people, give it to someone else to read. <br>  6. Not sure whether you can say so or that?  Do I need a hyphen?  Run on Yandex or Google!  We drive in a phrase or a word and look at the answers, as well as that for the resources returned to us the search engine.  Can you trust them? <br><br>  So, the letter: <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <font color="blue">blue</font> highlighted pieces that I put <br>  <font color="red">red</font> highlights controversial places and errors <br>  =================================== <br>  from IEEE Russia NorthWest &lt; <s>deleted</s> @ gmail.com&gt; <br>  to <s>deleted</s> @ gmail.com <br>  date Wed, Jan 7, 2009 at 1:30 PM <br>  subject Russia NW Section: <b><font color="red">S Novim 2009 godom</font></b> <i><font color="gray">mmm ...

      Members of the Russian <font color="red">Northwest *</font> IEEE Section <br>  <font color="blue">* - North-West</font> <br><br>  Dear Colleagues! <br><br>  <font color="red">Our year 2008 ended</font> in the ranks of the IEEE Russian Northwest Section, which now has 248 members, including 2 <font color="red">Fellow **</font> , 23 <font color="red">Senior **</font> and 58 <font color="red">Student Members **</font> . <br>  <font color="gray">* Is it like oo?</font>  <font color="gray">IEEE since Christmas taxied in the Northwest?</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray">** - I understand that these words do not even have close analogues in Russian ^ __ ^</font> <br><br>  In the section, many interesting meetings <font color="blue"><b>,</b></font> conferences and seminars were held in all 9 <font color="red">TIs *</font> and the LETI student department.  An important step forward was the creation of the <font color="red"><s>creation of the</s></font> second student department at the University of Film and Television ( <font color="red">President Advisor **</font> <font color="blue"><b>,</b></font> Professor Konstantin Frantsevich Glasman) and the new information theory <font color="red">cepter</font> operating under the auspices of all three IEEE Russian sections.  Our section in this new <font color="red">chepter *</font> is represented by Vice <font color="red"><b>-</b></font> Chairman Sergey V. Fedorenko. <br>  <font color="gray">* - OMG !!!</font>  <font color="gray">WTF ???</font>  <font color="gray">what did a man mean?</font>  <font color="gray">If one of the Russian meanings of the English word chapter, which is the word "branch", then why not write the "student chepeter LETI" ???</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray">** - advisor, he is usually attached to someone.</font>  <font color="gray">So they write: "The President, Advisor to the Rector of the Saratov State Academy of Law."</font> <br><br>  The Technical English Program (TEP) program, created by our sections and <font color="red">currently covering 63 IEEE * student members, has been</font> further developed.  The spring semester of 2008 ended with an interesting 8-hour <font color="red">tutorial **</font> on May 24 held by the current and present IEEE vice-presidents for educational activities Moshe Kam and Evangelia Tzanakou in a <font color="red">beautiful</font> Renaissance hotel in the center of St. Petersburg with 38 students participating.  Just recently <font color="blue"><b>,</b></font> before the New Year <font color="blue"><b>,</b></font> Moshe Kam and his assistants organized a new <font color="red">tutorial **</font> for the 29 participants of the TEP fall semester in the wonderful Radison SAS Hotel, which was preceded by a reception in the main rooms of the Stroganov Palace.  To disseminate the experience of the TEP organization, IEEE plans in October this year in our city to hold a world IEEE seminar with the invitation of all teachers and organizers of technical English language training. <br>  <font color="gray">* - very controversial phrase.</font>  <font color="gray">63 student members in general uzhosnakh.</font>  <font color="gray">Maybe "63 students, members of IEEE"?</font>  <font color="gray">Then ... ‚Äúa program covering 63 student members ...‚Äù It seems to me that in this context the word ‚Äúcovering‚Äù does not apply at all to people, but only, perhaps, to regions.</font>  <font color="gray">Although, in another situation, it is easy to say: ‚ÄúHunger, covering the stomachs of 63 three IEEE members, gives us one more time to make sure that dinner was planned for a reason!‚Äù</font> <font color="gray"><br></font>  <font color="gray">** - OMG !!!</font>  <font color="gray">WTF ???</font>  <font color="gray">‚Ññ2</font> <br><br>  Another very important event of our section is the preparation for the main technical conference of the region 8 IEEE Eurocon2009 (www.ieee.org/go/eurocon2009), which will be held in our city on May 18-24.  The conference is dedicated to the 150th anniversary of A.S. Popov.  Currently, 518 reports have already been received, which are planned to be heard at 19 sections and special sessions of the conference. <br><br>  On behalf of the Executive Committee of the section, I congratulate all our colleagues and friends on the occasion of the New <font color="red">Year</font> 2009 <font color="red">*</font> , I wish you good health and continued success in bringing together engineers from all over the world <font color="red"><b>.</b></font> <br>  <font color="gray">* - "New" with a capital letter, but "year" is not ... Not good.</font> <br><br>  Alexander Mikerov <font color="gray">What for two signatures?</font>  <font color="gray">Automatically added?</font>  <font color="gray">Eeeh</font> <br><br>  - <br>  Alexander Mikerov <br>  Doctor of Tech.

Organization is INTERNATIONAL!  The exception, as far as I know, is made only for the Chinese.  And further.  I do not want to present myself as some kind of a smart guy or a guru in the Russian language.  Not at all, I just wanted to give six tips to people who do not have built-in literacy.  In short, like me ;-) <br><br>  PS find something else, write in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48547/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48547/</a></p>
