  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Gearbest now speaks Russian</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  June 6, Russia and the whole world celebrate the birthday of A.S.  Pushkin.  The name of the poet is one of the first associations with the Russian language, Russian speech.  And this is true.  According to linguists, Pushkin's vocabulary was about 22,000 words.  For comparison: most often in Russian a little more than 9,000 words are used, and a highly educated adult knows about 8,000 words.  The vocabulary of Ellochka-cannibals from ‚Äú12 chairs‚Äù was 30 words.  It‚Äôs not that the automatic translation of Chinese online shopping websites knew few words - he just fancifully combined them.  To whom laughter, and to whom and a serious business problem.  Which we seem to have decided.  Now June 6th is also the birthday of Russian-speaking Gearbest. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c97/489/d49/c97489d49a0d4f5d6ab0d9e5b25b8585.jpg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Clear definition </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d6/ab1/5b6/1d6ab15b69192442a188bbb5bcb1876a.jpg" align="left" height="200">  Descriptions of Chinese goods on the websites of online stores provided topics for jokes and demotivators of trolls and creatives of all stripes.  Through the efforts of online translators, many interesting things were created from the category ‚Äúfish man's head‚Äù.  Some buyers turned to English versions, owning other languages ‚Äã‚Äãwere guided almost to the touch.  Despite a bit of humor, the problem remained and was rather sad.  First of all, because Russia is the largest market for Gearbest.  Visitors to the store had a lot of questions about the site interface, a lot was not clear for Russian-speaking customers, and we decided to fix it and tried to make the buying process as easy as possible.  In general, there is nothing accidental in the fact that it was Russian that became the first <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">official translation of the site</a> . <br><br><h2>  Important circumstance </h2><br>  Now you have access to a convenient product catalog by categories, the website interface, personal account, shopping cart, <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/ru/about/faq.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">questions about the store</a> (FAQ), and also how to <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/ru/about/make-money.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">make money</a> with us.  We tried to make everything as convenient as possible for the Russian-speaking audience.

      Of the useful options on the site - we have introduced accurate information about the time of sending a particular product from the warehouse, now also all tickets created through the Russian version of the site will be processed in Russian.  We are sure that between us there will be less misunderstanding for eliminating the language barrier. <br><br>  We remind the site structure for those who were stopped by the lack of skills in the English language and who now wants to get to know us better. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Buy in the section</b> - a handy product catalog with subdirectories of product groups.  From the drop-down list without filters and additional clicks, you can select the desired category. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Basket</b> - the place of purchase.  Check the number of selected products, the exact name and terms of delivery (it is paid and free). <br><br></li><li>  <b>My favorites</b> are the <s>romantic</s> useful section where you can put aside favorite items and track them, for example, before the sale.  However, we remind you that the majority of users have mastered this trick - and may not remain for distribution. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Products similar to those you've already viewed</b> - products that you may like, add to the purchase or be a more profitable purchase. <br><br></li><li>  <b>New arrivals</b> - products that appeared in the warehouse or just entered the market.  Often unexpected discounts are set on them. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Banners in the middle of the page</b> - the freshest and seasonal offers and sales.  Constantly updated and contain thematic products.  Inside these proposals is also provided for the grouping of goods according to popular features.  There also live instant (flash) sales, when the goods can be bought at a very low price as soon as possible. <br></li></ul><br>  Inside each product card contains detailed information about it: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Description</b> - a detailed set of tactical and technical characteristics, specifications and features. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Product discussion</b> - ratings and customer reviews, answers to questions, video reviews, photo galleries. <br><br></li><li>  <b>Shipping and payment</b> - types and terms of delivery, as well as payment methods available for the product. <br></li></ul><br>  Next to the product photos in several angles there are buttons of filters that must be considered when choosing the right color, size, memory size and other important characteristics. <br><br><h2>  Pleasant addition number 1 </h2><br>  In honor of the launch of the Russian version of the store, we have prepared a <a href="http://ru.gearbest.com/m-promotion-active-237.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">lottery</a> for you, where for $ 1 you can become the owner of any of the 12 popular gadgets.  In addition to the lottery on the page promotions you are traditionally waiting for low prices.  Join now! <br><br><h2>  Pleasant addition number 2 </h2><br>  And, of course, we could not leave such an important event without additional surprises.  Until July 15, 2016, the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_362705.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Original Xiaomi Mi Band 2 Heart Rate</a> Bracelet <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_362705.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Smart Wristband</a> bracelet will be available for order at a price of $ 33.99 with a <b>GBMI2</b> coupon. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f8/110/a73/2f8110a73487dce329c4b5ce4d6e2992.jpg"></div><br>  By the way, using the example of this bracelet, we explain a small feature: the Russian site displays only those products that are in stock.  If you want to pre-order a new product, you need to use the English version.  As soon as the new gadget goes to the warehouse, it will immediately appear in the Russian version of the store. <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> we will be glad to receive comments, corrections, bug reports and any requests from you.  Grammar Nazis are welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394991/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394991/</a></p>
