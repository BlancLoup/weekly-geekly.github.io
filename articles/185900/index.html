  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Obesity on the web. A little bit personal about browser development trends.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, you rarely meet a PC user whose internet browser is not in the top 5 most frequently launched programs.  Whether due to, or in spite of progress, the world wide web in the past five years has been shrouding our everyday life more and more closely.  At the beginning of this century, a cell phone with a color screen and a polyphonic call was the last squeak and a very prestigious thing.  And now we criticize smartphones for the fact that not all of them are able to immediately send photos to the social network.  I mean that the lightning fickleness of the world sets a new speed for our life.  And accordingly, not only we should change, but also the technology surrounding us. <br><br>  Once there were enough features that browsers offered out of the box.  We kept dozens of open windows and did not know about tabs and plugins.  All sorts of tvikersky tools that offered to carry out tuning the browser at once were a lot of enthusiasts. <br><br>  And now, no one is surprised by the OS, which is entirely tied to interaction with web servers, and the flea markets of extensions for popular browsers resemble huge markets, where trade is buzzing.  Many researchers predict that a little more, and the main key to the account will be a flash drive with a fingerprint, and the OS will fit in one such global client that needs a wide Internet channel.  Computing capacities are growing, file storages are being built, but for the time being we live in the old manner and do not fully trust our data to cloud services.  In addition, the "big brother" is too insidious, so that we can fully give ourselves to him. <br>  Another cunning thing is that it is now fashionable to urge the audience to change gadgets as soon as possible and not really thoroughly work out the optimization.  You know, one parallel suggests itself.  In the suburbs of a large city there is a village where there is no asphalt, but housing there gives an increase in status.  A large part of those who move there for permanent residence, immediately acquire jeeps and high fences, while not falling asleep at the same fossa three meters from their own gates.  Those who are deprived of high incomes have to constantly crawl along these bumps. <a name="habracut"></a>

      In this sense, it is somewhat sad that netbooks have fallen under the onslaught of tablets and ultrabooks.  Why adjust the performance for a weak system, because a couple of gigabytes of RAM costs crumbs!  And to reproach that the software "does not plow" on a netbook two years ago is in vain. <br><br>  A couple of years ago, my office computer on Windows 7, with 1 GB and ‚ÄúOpera,‚Äù which loved cache, quite cheerfully kept 20-30 open tabs and a running office software package.  Today, the same amount of RAM - androids, and even 4 GB on the desktop seem to be yesterday afternoon.  Browsers have to put dozens of extensions, so 5-10 tabs inevitably eat up to half a gigabyte of RAM.  Sites with heavy content, such as video hosting, social networks or news portals, updated every 30 seconds, also increase the consumption of RAM.  Finally, many completely tiny add-ons (for example, a substitute for an express panel) sometimes consume memory in tens of megabytes, and all they have to do is keep ten URLs with thumbnails visible.  It is clear that you can temper the appetite of the browser, if a) you don‚Äôt resort to plugins at all, and b) you can dig into the settings for half an hour.  However, it is annoying that the developers do not care about the efficiency of the starting configuration. <br><br>  Previously, I was convinced that 8 GB, eight cores and 64-bit systems are needed by those who are engaged in 3D modeling, distilling HD video or administering huge data streams.  Now it seems to me more and more that 8 GB is needed just to make the browser work normally.  But do I really need a lot of extensions?  At the very least, you need to be able to 1. disable extraneous banners, 2. at any time, click and share on social networks, 3. leave only text and photos on the page, 4. select the desired font for site elements (Arial and Times become boring), 5. with one click, clear the cache and / or browser history, 6. prevent sites from installing various spyware, such as tracking cookies, 7. check / straighten strange links, 8. take a screenshot of any page, 9. save any text fragment to notes.  Very modest requests, I think.  Essentially, so to speak.  And yet, these are nine extensions.  Add a couple of little things, plus that and that.  And now 15 extensions.  Each of which eats - at least - 10 MB each.  Total empty browser with one tab will consume 200 MB.  And also the small things of these tabs will be typed with 10 pieces.  E-mail, forum, news portal, interesting article.  Gradually, it turns out that the browser has already ‚Äúeaten‚Äù more than 1.5 GB.  And by the end of the day, equally moderate appetites lead to a loss of browser capacity.  By the way, because of this, I rarely use lame comrades and with caution I look at the development of the fifteenth generation of the Opera. <br><br>  From the ideal browser I would like the notorious economy.  Which can be achieved through the account of the automatic inclusion of some extensions on the sites for which these extensions are written.  That is, if I have opened site ‚ÄúA‚Äù, then extensions for site ‚ÄúB‚Äù should be downloaded from the browser‚Äôs memory.  I want to see some kind of basic development of what concerns safe surfing (hi, Chrome!).  I would like to have some regular equivalent of Evernote Clearly.  Like, if there are 20 tabs hanging half a day, then part of them, to save PC resources, can and should be translated into ‚Äúprint mode‚Äù.  And when entering them, hang the warning ‚ÄúYou are on a reduced version of the site.‚Äù  According to the same scheme, I want to automatically disable extensions and plug-ins that have not been used for a specified period of time.  Yes, you will argue, now there is such a thing (in particular, in the ‚ÄúOpera‚Äù 15), but in it you need to prescribe a lot with pens.  For <b>each</b> of the hundreds of sites to register plugin settings?  For me, this is unacceptable. <br><br>  It turned out that the combine brisk "Opera" capitulated to the skating rink of the poor but voracious "Chrome".  For obvious reasons.  Housewives and other undemanding audiences do not need the utility of the combine.  Subsequently, they also hyster on the forums that a password was stolen or some other obscenity a la "I clicked on a banner that suggested" urgently update your browser right now. "  In addition, the Google client base is huge - the main search engine of the planet, whatever one may say.  In addition, at the dawn of his growing up, ‚ÄúChrome‚Äù hit many with its speed.  But careless users, who can not be called competent in the field of network security, oh, how much ... As a minority, we must not forget about the majority.  Well, the same combine has to be collected independently, manually adding, at first glance, basic things.  Collect from Comodo Dragon, ‚ÄúFirefox‚Äù or ‚ÄúOpera‚Äù 15. Either mess around with not exactly known Lunascape or Maxthon and hope that there will not be serious tears along with vulnerabilities. <br><br>  It turns out that today, none of the current versions of leading browsers can offer gigantic functionality out of the box, but the advice to purchase the RAM bar is still relevant ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185900/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185900/</a></p>
