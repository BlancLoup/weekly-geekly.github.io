  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nofollow, or dofollow - that is the question - or general hysteria in the blogosphere</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  - cross post from my <a href="http://absolvo.ru/2008-06-12/nofollow-or-dofollow-that-is-the-question/">blog</a> <br>  Writing this article has put me under serious thought about whether to remove ‚Äúrel = nofollow‚Äù from my blog, which in WP has been taking place since version 1.5.  In order not to harm myself in the future, I read the information, references, etc., and decided to share the findings. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What is nofollow? </h2><br>  In simpler terms, this is an HTML attribute of the tag A, which tells search engines that you do not need to click on a link.  This attribute was introduced by Google in 2005 in order to reduce the impact of spam on search engine results and reduce the likelihood of PageRank.  In fact, everything is a little more complicated on the technical side and closely connected with the algorithms of search robots, but I conveyed the meaning to you quite accurately. <br><br>  It is worth considering that many search engines either understand this tag or have their own analogues.  For example, our giant Yandex suggests using the noindex tag. <br><br>
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      By the way, not only bloggers cover up nofollow links, but also large resources, such as Digg.com or YouTube. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/e9e/971/69f/e9e97169fcc438cde60912375c685da6.jpg" alt="Nofollow, or dofollow: that is the question - or general hysteria in the blogosphere"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/dce/85a/8cd/dce85a8cdfd05c7ff64a6879378bd466.jpg" alt="Nofollow, or dofollow: that is the question - or general hysteria in the blogosphere"><br><br><h2>  Blog Spam </h2><br>  For me, spam is my scourge, I spend up to 15 minutes a day (for me 15 minutes is a lot, no matter how cool) is wiping spam from my pages, even under the condition of working, in principle, quite good plug-ins that allow you to keep black sheets, including masks.  At such moments, I understand that the nofollow tag is extremely useful.  After all, he partially protects me from what I, in essence, use. <br><br>  Up to 50 spam comments or trackbacks are left for my records per day.  Up to half, either WP himself kills, or the plugins I've installed.  The rest is handles, simultaneously teaching plugins to kill and quarter spam comments. <br><br><h2>  What are people to blame? </h2><br>  I asked myself this question when I thought last night about whether I should remove this attribute from my links or leave it and add noindex for reliability?  For me, as a newbie in stand alone blog movement, it‚Äôs not quite clear why people cannot get a small plus from the fact that they actively participate in the life of not only their blog, but also the blogs of their friends.  Of course, it can be said that mutual subscription to the tape is the true manifestation of feelings of friendliness and loyalty.  However, I disagree with that.  People come not only from blogs, but also from search engines. <br><br>  More than 40 people come to my blog per day from search engines for various requests.  I am more than sure that this figure would be greater if it were not for nofollow. <br><br>  In the end - stand alone blog is not only interesting posts, but also work.  Work on keeping your blog clean.  You must give your commentator not only a chance to speak and take part in the conversation, but also get some bonus from the fact that he left a comment.  If I may say so, in some way, to motivate him. <br><br>  An unpleasant situation has developed in the blogosphere (to me at least, it is unpleasant) when owners of popular blogs manipulate links in order to get profit from it.  They sell them, change them, use them as an enrichment mechanism, both of their own pocket and of their blog's indicators. <br><br>  The only cases where I like the guards (and this is the name given to such links) is when they are put up in gratitude for any help, or simply share interesting material with their readers (I often do in the ‚ÄúReferences for the weekend‚Äù heading) . <br><br><h2>  What to do?  And why? </h2><br>  I will not say what to do to you, but what I did - I will tell you. <br><ol><li>  From today I remove nofollow from my blog.  I propose to use this,) </li><li>  On a blog, it‚Äôs quite realistic to expect a captcha.  If I find one that I personally (and therefore most readers) annoy and cause no problems. </li><li>  Morally prepared for the fact that spam will be a little more. </li></ol><br><h2>  Instead of conclusion </h2><br>  One of the reasons why I finally removed nofollow is the complete lack of desire to monetize traffic on my blog.  I do not want to earn on it, I just write to my blog. <br><br>  Remember, if you want to make money on your blog, the lack of nofollow can not only increase the number of people coming from search engines, but even the opposite - reduce it. <br><br>  I can tell you about this, suppose in about two weeks, when it will be possible to embed graphs and try to understand how this has affected search engine traffic. <br><br><h2>  Sentence </h2><br>  I suggest you remove nofollow on your blog as an outdated tool.  If after reading this article you decide to remove it, leave a comment, I will put a link to you on a separate page on my blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287510/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287510/</a></p>
