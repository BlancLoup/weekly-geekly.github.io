At the same time for a company, a group of people, a startup or even a small blog is a huge problem to keep your audience informed about the news.  Even the usual notification about the extension of a paid account or the notification of a personal message, you can not see if it came to the device inconvenient for the user or in an inconvenient form. <br><br>  PushAll seeks to create something similar to such a universal tool.  You can notify any of your users, without any development for different platforms, without investing huge funds to maintain staff, equipment and software. <br><br>  At the same time, we are developing a service primarily not for companies that want to send notifications, but specifically for users who want to receive these notifications.  The problem is that even if a company creates a software package to alert users on different platforms - usually any garbage that people do not like is added there.

      We have released an <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/pushall/id1021404069">application for iOS</a> and updated the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.bupyc.pushall.app">application for Android</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  99%? </h2><br>  If you take statistics Liveinternet, it turns out that 94% of users use either a browser with notification support, or a browser installed on a mobile device.  The remaining 6% are Explorer and Edge, and most likely these users have a smartphone on Android or iOS, or in the end, a regular email. <br><br>  In this article we want to talk about how you can solve a simple problem - notify the user.  Now, many are trying to use email-mailing - but not all users are comfortable.  Someone wants to send via telegrams - but not everyone wants to use telegrams.  And so on.  The more you give the user the opportunity to receive information from you, the greater the chance that he will receive it. <br><br>  However, for each user wish you have to pay money.  For each mobile platform, hire developers, hire SMMs for social networks, web developers for the site, but you still won‚Äôt cover the maximum amount of possible user choice variations at a time. <br><br>  Our goal is to provide the user with a choice, and develop tools to improve the use of this choice. <br><br><h2>  Where can a user get a notification now? </h2><br>  We will proceed from different life situations, and give examples of possibilities of obtaining, as well as options for your own decision. <br><br><h3>  He has a smartphone on ... </h3><br>  Everyone has a smartphone in their pocket, while few use typical SMS and Email.  By sending notifications ‚Äúin the old-fashioned way‚Äù you can make a bad impression on the user, as he was already used to receiving instant notifications through applications. <br><br><h4>  Android </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d3/f9e/045/4d3f9e0451fd4b4893b27a7d9ecdda92" width="300"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07e/2a3/791/07e2a3791c99498ead697a152a5c4f4c.jpg" width="300"><br><br>  There are 4 methods of receiving notifications: the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.bupyc.pushall.app">official application</a> , web pushes to any supported browser (most often chrome), via a booth in a telegraph, and via email. <br>  At the same time, the user has access to the history of notifications with an icon, title and text, a catalog of channels and subscriptions. <br><br>  For self-development and support of the Android application, you will have to hire a developer or a studio.  You will constantly need to update the app to match current technologies from Google. <br><br>  Application link: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.bupyc.pushall.app">play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bupyc.pushall.app</a> <br><br><h4>  iOS </h4><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0bd/f18/dc5/0bdf18dc58434f468c3b7c2408034deb.jpg"></div><br>  Everything is supported the same, except for the web-push: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/pushall/id1021404069">there is an application PushAll</a> , a bot in the telegraph, email notifications.  Some competitive web push services draw beautiful illustrations with an iPhone and browser notifications coming to it - <b>these are fairy tales</b> .  Apple has no technology to send notifications to the iPhone without installing applications. <br><br>  For self-development you will also need to hire a developer or a studio.  Most likely, you will need to create an account for the company.  You need to update the application in accordance with the new versions of iOS.  But the main problem is that you simply can‚Äôt go through the review, as Apple has very strict rules.  We spent a lot of time developing the application to comply with all the rules for admission to the store.  The entry is much more complicated than with Android. <br><br>  Link to application: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/pushall/id1021404069">itunes.apple.com/ru/app/pushall/id1021404069</a> <br><br><h4>  Windows phone </h4><br>  We did not make the application, since the audience of this platform is thinning, but even here there is a choice - either a Telegram bot, or a mailing list. <br><br><h3>  He has a computer ... </h3><br>  Any computer will support notifications via bot telegrams or via e-mail, even if it was a computer of the 1990s. <br><br><h4>  With a browser on the Chrome engine </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/677/16c/561/67716c5617744de7bc50da486ae853cd.png" align="left" width="300"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf0/0ed/159/bf00ed1595cd462a872ec91522575299.png" width="300"><br><br>  Here the user can receive notifications to the browser either via web push or via an add-on.  In addition, there is a built-in channel history and a section with missed notifications. <br><br>  In fact, for self-development of web-pushing in chrome, you only need to sit behind the code for a couple of hours, however there are overhead costs for sending, collecting statistics, for updating the code with updating the API.  Also, we strongly do not recommend the use of the web-push in its pure form - they annoy users.  The most popular article on our site is how to turn them off: <a href="https://pushall.ru/blog/destroy">pushall.ru/blog/destroy</a> <br><br><h4>  Firefox and Safari </h4><br>  With Firefox, everything is even simpler than with Chrome, but Safari stands aside: to send guns to safari on MacOS, you will need a developer account, a send server with a permanent connection to APNS, and you will also need to monitor the validity of certificates and notifications.  That is, the usual hosting will not work, and for a novice developer the creation of such a system can be difficult. <br><br><h2>  And if he does not want to use PushAll? </h2><br>  We are working on questions on the subject of ‚Äúand if ...‚Äù Conversion of user engagement is solved by an extensive number of channels and platform support (and with this we now have no problems). <br><br>  For example, previously we had only the channels of the TV series voice studios, then we added news channels and streamer channels, we recently added the <a href="https://pushall.ru/adminvk">AdminVK</a> channel, which attracted the audience of Vkontakte group owners.  The more channels, the more interested the user is to install applications on all devices and receive notifications.  Channel 1 can give a conversion of attraction of 10%, and a dozen thematic channels for the user can attract it already with a probability of 80%.  There are about 3000 channels at the time of this writing. Of these, about 300 are popular. <br><br>  You also need to keep in mind that there are already people in the system, there are currently about 50 thousand of them.  Adding new channels increases the number of users.  This means that the coverage of users is growing. <br><br><h2>  What is the difference from RSS or social networks? </h2><br>  RSS is a handy thing for a geek, but for most users, the maximum effort they can make is installing the application and pressing the login button.  At the same time, RSS is just an XML file that you parse through requests, RSS itself will not be able to notify you about the replenishment of your account or a new message in the community, or the inaccessibility of your site. <br><br>  Social networks in fact have a similar problem.  Again, they more often play a broadcasting character, rather than a point character, and in terms of broadcasting, everything is bad now.  If your record is popular, more people will see it, but if not, almost no one will see it.  Since all social networks now have a "smart tape". <br><br>  Channels in PushAll receive about 30-50% of readings from the active audience within a minute after sending.  In VKontakte, per 100 thousand subscribers of the group, in the first hour 1-2 thousand views of the post come out.  This ratio also indicates the activity of the audience - according to our statistics, 1 user PushAll by activity is equal to one hundred users in the VC.  This is achieved due to the fact that during the day only a small part of your subscribers of the VKontakte group reads the tape, and many in general scroll through it, while the notification can be seen immediately. <br><br>  We are also developing opportunities for selecting audience segments: there is now filtering on the user side and multicast broadcasts on the channel side when you can select a list of users and send notifications to them.  We are working on a hybrid method - users choose topics by checkboxes, and you are already combining these topics send notifications. <br>  In this case, you will always know what coverage you will end up with. <br><br><h2>  Results </h2><br>  You can spend huge amounts of money on developing an infrastructure that will be inconvenient for your users and who will not use it, or you can <a href="https://pushall.ru/blog/create">simply create a channel in PushAll</a> and users will be able to choose how they receive notifications, in what form and where.  We take care of this ourselves. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319682/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319682/</a></p>
