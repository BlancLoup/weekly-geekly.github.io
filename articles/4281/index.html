  <section class="page js-page"><h1>High-tech shuffle</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Minister of Information Technology and Communications, Leonid Reiman, said that Russian President Vladimir Putin supported his proposal to establish two new federal agencies - on information systems (Rosinformsystem) and on export development in the field of information technologies (Rosinformexport).  In the Ministry of Communications and Telecommunications, to which the new agencies will be subordinate, they explained the reasons for their education by the need to fulfill the presidential instruction to ensure coordination at holding events by various levels of government in the development of info-communication technologies and control over budget spending in this area. <br><br>  This step logically fits into the strategy of the Ministry of Information Technologies, which <a href="http://www.mn.ru/issue.php%3F2004-48-20">since 2004 has been strengthening its influence on the IT industry</a> .  So, IT exports (that is, offshore programming), which will be in charge of Rosinformexport, is a super-profitable and fast-growing industry: last year IT exports amounted to $ 1 billion, and this year it is expected to increase by 30%.  The competence of the new agency will include the provision of information, analytical and marketing support services for promoting Russian IT products and services to the world market.  According to Mr. Reiman, this ‚Äúwill provide an opportunity to use Russia's strengthened positions in the global IT market for the development of high-tech exports in general.‚Äù <br><br>  The other agency, Rosinforsystems, is intended to become ‚Äúa federal body that performs law-enforcement functions and functions for the provision of public services related to the creation of state information systems and ensuring their integration.‚Äù  Today, the <a href="http://www.voskhod.ru/">Scientific and Technical Institute ‚ÄúVoskhod‚Äù</a> , a subordinate of the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications, is developing various state automated systems: for providing automatic calculation of election results, for automating the activities of courts, for introducing bio passports and others.

      At the same time, the creation of many state systems passes by the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications. <br>  For example, <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/news/top/index.shtml%3F2006/08/07/207645">a variety of agencies have worked</a> on the ‚Äúnotorious‚Äù Unified State Automated Information System for Alcohol Production and Turnover (EGAIS): the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Development and Trade, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Federal Tax Service, the Federal Security Service, but only not the Ministry of Communications.  Rosinformsystem is called upon to fill this gap, and Minister Reiman has already confirmed that his department also plans to take part in the work on EGAIS. <br><br>  Speaking about the new agencies, the minister did not say who would lead them, thereby creating another version of the events.  The fact is that Rosinformsystem will, de facto, be just a new name of the already existing and also subordinate to the Ministry of Information Technologies and Communications of the Federal Agency for Information Technologies (Rosinformtekhnologii).  But legally changing signage from a government department means its liquidation with the dismissal of all employees and the formation of a new one.  In the current Rosinformtekhnologii, the direction of information systems, which should become the priority direction of the work of this agency after its renaming, is overseen by the deputy head of the agency, Alexander Pankratov.  At the same time, the participants of the IT market are well aware of the conflict between him and the head of the agency, Vladimir Matyuhinim.  Thus, it is possible that the renaming of Rosinformtechnologies was started with the aim of a diplomatic resolution of the conflict between its two leaders in favor of one of them. <br><br>  <b><i>From the archives of Media-Most</i> : who governed IT in Russia</b> <br><br>  In 1990, the Ministry of Communications of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was led by the ‚Äúenergetic‚Äù Vladimir Bulgak, having achieved at the same time the transfer of new powers to him: space management and informatization.  However, two years later, in 1992, in connection with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Ministry of Communications of the Russian Federation was created anew, losing non-core areas.  Informatization issues are relegated to the committee of the same name, created from the beginning under the government, and in 1993, reassigned to the president. <br><br>  In 1997, the Ministry of Communications was reduced to the level of a committee, but instead it was merged with the Committee on Informatization.  The head of the joint committee, the former deputy head of the Ministry of Communications, Anatoly Krupnaya, most of his speeches are just informatization.  In 2000, the Communications and Informatization Committee was returned to ministerial status. <br><br>  In March 2004, the ministries of communications and transport are merged into a single agency.  The issues of informatization are at the same time being under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Agency subordinate to this ministry.  However, its head Dmitry Milovantsev immediately supports the allocation of these functions into a separate agency. <br><br>  In May 2004, the Ministry of Communications was reconstructed, while receiving a new name - the Ministry of Information Technology and Communications.  It also includes the Federal Agency for Information Technologies.  Renaming the ministry was just a ‚Äúbeautiful‚Äù step, designed to explain the sudden revival of the Ministry of Communications, headed by Leonid Reiman.  However, Mr. Reiman rather quickly ‚Äúcaught up‚Äù with this idea, saying that the state would be engaged not only in managing the informatization process, but also in regulating the entire IT industry.  Since most of his speeches, Mr. Reiman is dedicated to information technology ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4281/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4281/</a></p>
