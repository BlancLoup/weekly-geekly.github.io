It takes time, and nerves, and money.  A year ago, once again leaving the doctor a few wages, I decided that it was better to prevent the disease, and not to eliminate its consequences.  The most likely candidate for optimization has become a toothbrush.  The dentist said that my cleansing is not good enough. <br><br>  After parsing dozens of reviews, I found <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5273797/omron-accelerometered-toothbrush-knows-exactly-what-its-brushing">an article on gizmodo</a> about the brush of the Japanese company Omron - <a href="http://www.healthcare.omron.co.jp/product/feature/67">Mediclean HT-B551</a> .  This determined my choice - I certainly wanted a device with a gyroscope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff8/647/174/ff86471744b51075feeaf71450ea1b24.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Prerequisites of choice </h4><br>  Prior to this, the evolution of my toothbrushes was this: the usual mechanical in the range, electric <a href="http://www.oralb.com/products/vitality-precision-clean/">Oral-B Vitality</a> and sound <a href="http://www.hktdc.com/suppliers-products/Rechargeable-Electric-Toothbrush/en/1X03WUD5/1197195/">Supercare</a> .

      There is nothing special to say about ordinary mechanical brushes - they were sad, I never had the patience and skill to use them qualitatively. <br><br>  The electric brush on their background was just a gift: lead slowly to the teeth - she will do the rest herself.  A big plus - it fully cleared and distant molars and back streets, in which the mechanical brush had nowhere to turn.  However, there was a minus: the movement of the brush was quite strong and unregulated, which led to damage to the gums. <br><br>  The next purchase was the sound Supercare - nouneym from China, which was quite good against the previous copies - soft bristles gently brushed their teeth without damaging the gums.  But even here there was a minus - because of this very softness, the teeth were not cleaned well enough, for which the dentist condemned me. <br><br>  I approached the selection of the next toothbrush with a clear list of requirements: <br><ul><li>  it must be electric (in order to clean the most inaccessible places); </li><li>  there should be a timer (in order to clean according to the recommendations of the dentists, and not according to internal sensations); </li><li>  the brush should be sound (the longitudinal movements of the rectangular head injure the gums less and clean better than the rotary movements of the round); </li><li>  It should be possible to adjust the intensity of movement (in order to gently clean the spaces around the gums). </li></ul><br><br>  Many purchase candidates met these criteria.  But only Omron Mediclean was equipped with a gyroscope, which allowed the brush to automatically switch between cleaning modes.  Which determined my choice. <br><br><h4>  Purchase </h4><br>  Unfortunately, sometimes what you like is not sold in the nearest store.  Not an exception, and a toothbrush.  It was purchased on <a href="http://www.amazon.co.jp/">amazon.co.jp</a> , and then sent by mail <a href="http://www.tenso.com/">forwarding</a> service via EMS to Vladivostok. <br>  The device cost 8,062 yen (3,340r. At the then rate), the commission of the intermediary and the cost of shipping cost about 600-800r.  (more difficult to say, since the mail forwarder was consolidated with other things). <br><br><h4>  Automatic switching system </h4><br>  The first attempt to use left mixed impressions.  To understand why, I first tell you more about the main feature - about automation.  The brush has three brushing modes: weak (horizontal movements of bristles about 20,000 times per minute), medium (vertical movements about 27,000 times per minute) and strong (vertical movements about 32,500 times per minute).  Each of these modes can be changed by forcibly pressing a button on the brush body. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b48/702/8d9/b487028d99dfa61e780b1e79b61fe3c8.png"><br><br>  When the automatic mode change is on, the gyroscope determines the position of the brush in space. <br><br>  If the brush is positioned horizontally with the bristles to the side, then it is assumed that the side surface of the teeth and gums are cleaned - in this case a weak mode is activated.  The bristles, gently humming, gently massage the gums and gently clean the bottom of the teeth. <br><br>  If the brush is inclined at 45 degrees, then it is assumed that cleaning of the cutting edge of the tooth occurs.  In this case, the medium mode is activated, the brush intensively cleans the protruding parts of the teeth. <br><br>  If the brush is tilted horizontally with the bristles downwards, it means that the horizontal surfaces of the teeth or some hard-to-reach spaces are being cleaned.  This is the most intense program when the brush buzzes louder, and furiously rubs the bristles. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-k009MXpfdo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiYVEwqrEBX9G5fuBqZN8lJNHyKkQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  It would seem that everything is simple and logical.  But it‚Äôs not for nothing that the user manual attached to the brush had a clear image of a person standing very straight and a crossed out image of a slouching person.  I, as usual, bending over three deaths over the sink, tilted the brush correctly relative to the teeth, but incorrectly relative to the horizon.  As a result, the automatics completely illogically switched the modes, then abruptly starting to clean the gums strongly, then barely moving over the distant teeth.  It took several days to develop the habit of standing upright, like a tin soldier.  The motive was not bad - in those moments when I managed to catch the balance, my teeth were cleaned perfectly. <br><br>  Somewhere in a week I could already boast smooth, clean teeth.  Cleaning has become a pleasant and lazy procedure - which is what I needed. <br><br><h4>  Other features </h4><br><h5>  Timer </h5><br>  The timer disappointed me - I expected it to be built into the brush, and somehow signalize to me about the time in the cleaning process.  In fact, the timer is the light bezel around charging. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/543/31a/82e/54331a82e7f937a8cff567aa32e7539b.png"><br><br>  At a minimum, this means that when cleaning for charging you need to constantly look in order not to oversleep the moment.  I do not have an outlet in the bathroom, charging is in the room, and the timer is therefore not available to me. <br><br><h5>  Charger </h5><br>  Induction.  On the range of 110-240V.  I have it stuck in the transformer to the refrigerator, but if you have an adapter, you can use the usual 220V socket. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/742/5fd/548/7425fd54862d0ac3bbbe32a76a59ca37.png"><br><br><h5>  A pen </h5><br>  Very comfortable, ergonomically curved.  In the hand lies firmly and easily.  Perhaps for some it will not be an important factor, but there is a nice plus: dirt does not get into the plastic of the brush.  Now, after so many months of use, the plastic has remained primordially light, there are no nasty gray bands of indelible dirt.  The device looks like just out of the box. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Now, after a year, my teeth are cleaned carefully and efficiently every day.  Both I and my dentist are pleased with the result.  If I come to the change of brushes, it is only because of the timer - I do not have enough of it for a feeling of complete perfection and harmony. <br><br>  <b>upd:</b> <br>  Brush - not ultrasonic, but sound.
