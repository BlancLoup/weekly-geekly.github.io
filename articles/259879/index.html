Yes, they officially want developers' love and many, many third-party applications using their technology, as stated at the EmTech Didital conference.  So developers, and indeed all interested, can already sign up to receive the SDK for Magic Leap.  The framework will support Unity and Unreal Engine, a very smart choice.  ‚ÄúSDK‚Ä¶ done,‚Äù as the official <a href="https://twitter.com/magicleap/status/605841174595706881">Magic Leap</a> twitter told us.  When, when?  ‚ÄúSoon,‚Äù the same Twitter replies ... <br><br>  There are few people who have touched and looked at the result of the company's many years of work, stories and pictures seem to be a miracle bordering on deception ... but the company is at least supported by Google, so the miracle can be somewhere nearby.  By the way, part of the financial injections in the amount of 542 million dollars was spent on production capacity.  For ‚Äúwe have gone out of the R &amp; D phase and are moving to selling the product,‚Äù as CEO Rony Abovitz said.  And this is good. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  <b>Fiksu: mobile marketing costs continue to grow</b> </h3><br>  The price of acquiring a new user or keeping him in the game beats all records, and most likely this is not the limit!  Such conclusions were presented by <a href="https://www.fiksu.com/blog/mobile-mindset-marketing-costs-see-unprecedented-growth">Fiksu</a> based on its own data. Over the past April, growth was particularly significant - for iOS, the CPI (cost per install) increased by 39% to $ 2.13, and for Android - by 20% and reached $ 2.08.  The CPL (launch price) index increased at a similar rate and for iOS increased by 34% over the month and amounted to $ 0.41, and for Android the growth is 44% and $ 0.34, respectively, per user. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10e/a59/2fb/10ea592fb73245e999d87b8f5ae8826a.jpg"><br>  For comparison, the total CPL for iOS for the year increased by 75%, and for Android - by 169%.  The CPI index in the case of iOS grew by 54%, and with Android - by 59%, respectively.  Last year, at the same time, it was quite tempting to buy traffic on Android, but today there is definitely no significant difference in cost, but to say that you can win on the volume of Android users compared to what you can it would be to buy on iOS, it is already impossible and profitable to invest in traffic on iOS, if there is a choice. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b82/b5f/9c8/b82b5f9c85af4137a1a40dba4bc0e141.jpg"><br>  Fiksu analysts themselves are confident that the output in the redistribution of the budget.  It is necessary to invest in more expensive, but more efficient means.  If we talk about the advertising platform, then this is Facebook, and if about the format, then video advertising.  It is also recommended that retargeting be used more actively to attract existing inactive users to the application.  This will increase the number of IAPs and increase the profit generated by the application. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Fluent: seven out of ten mobile devices in America - based on the Android OS</b> </h3><br>  The previous news about the general increase in traffic, and in particular, about the incredible increase in the cost of the Android CPL for the year, can be fully argued by the statements of the New York advertising platform Fluent, which, based on its own data, reports that about 70% of mobile devices in the US work on Android OS.  And also you can see the distribution of the device depending on the gender of the user: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4f5/a3c/081/4f5a3c0813b9449b971b1582771ed345.jpg"><br><br>  The company presented data on viewing video ads on mobile devices in comparison with PCs and divided it into age categories: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/781/5c2/514/7815c25145d4481894fbd21ba94dfd16.jpg"><br><br>  Fluent has made its statistical calculations based on data received from US users who in one way or another interacted with its advertising platform. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>SuperData Research will open access to game analytics</b> </h3><br>  New project Arcade from research company SuperData, launched recently, will help to get free access to game analytics, or partially free ... <br><br>  There are already similar projects on the market (thinkgaming, appannie) that work according to a similar scheme: some general information is made publicly available, but a detailed account will be required for detailed and complete research.  Although the executive director of SuperData Research, Joost van Dreunen, points out that Arcade is the first project of its kind ... Most likely it‚Äôs about the ability to compare information simultaneously from several platforms and talking not only about mobile devices, but about PCs and consoles.  Now Arcade is in beta testing, and you can apply for participation <a href="https://www.superdataresearch.com/market-data/">here</a> . <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Briefly about WWDC 2015</b> </h3><br>  The 26th WWDC conference was pretty boring and without much news.  In fact, 3 OS and Apple Music were presented - without devices, without new technologies, without revolutions.  OS X El Capitan - Apple's new desktop system - now it will be possible to play games based on the Unreal Engine 4, but it seems the gamer is far from a target audience of Mac.  Let's hope that the promised performance will help more in the development of new projects and it will really be noticeable, and not just in words. <br><br>  Not spared, and iOS 9 - the developers it is available today.  The most interesting news was the announcement of the long-awaited full-fledged multitasking (God, and 10 years has not passed), which will only support iPad Air 2.Yes, now you can throw away all your old iPads and run the latest model to the store to watch 2 browser pages at the same time on one screen ... Why is it so difficult for iPad 3 - it doesn't fit in my head ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9d/b69/718/b9db6971876d428a884e5996b1f603c8.jpg"><br><br>  The watchOS 2 was also introduced - now developers will have access to a microphone, an accelerometer, a crown and much more, which will help to make the most of the clock functionality.  The OS will be released only in the fall, but today it is available to developers. <br><br>  Not enough time was devoted to the Apple Music application - all its ‚Äúincredible and wide functionality‚Äù will be available for $ 10 per month not only on iOS, but also on Windows or Android. <br><br><br><h3>  <b>Glu will earn half a billion on games "with the stars"</b> </h3><br>  Glu tried the branded games with the stars and they <a href="http://app2top.ru/games-2/glu-zarabotaet-polmilliarda-na-igrah-so-zvezdami-57954.html">liked it</a> !  Trial of the pen, the game Kim Kardashian: Hollywood, was released almost a year ago, but still brings about 30% of all company revenues.  Success decided to develop and consolidate.  A contract has already been signed with the first batch of stars: singers Katy Perry (Katy Perry) and Britney Spears (Britney Spears), participants of the reality show sisters Kendall (Kendall) and Kylie Jenner (Kylie Jenner).  Games with them will be released in the next year or two. <br><br>  I suspect Glu will succeed!  All of the above stars have multimillion armies of fans, and they can be successfully monetized, the audience is the most fertile.  What is funny, the star-brand repeats the way of social networks: first to gain an audience, keep it, and then successfully monetize using games.  We don‚Äôt worry about Glu, it‚Äôs more interesting how the brand of such stars will continue to develop: will they remain within the media or will they go further? <br><br><br>  ************************************************** ************************************************** ***************************************** <br>  If you liked the material and you had time to evaluate the professionalism of the authors of this blog - there is an opportunity to join them.
