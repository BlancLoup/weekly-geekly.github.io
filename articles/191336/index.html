      I was in the same place where I held the wall, treated me up and bandaged and taken to the surgeon.  The blood stopped flowing down my legs, this calmed me down a bit. </blockquote><br>  As you understand, there is a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/innokentys/posts/588668754509883">full version of</a> events. <br></div></div><br>  Do you think this incident helped to rethink life and understand that everything mundane is frail, including cellular communication?  Not certainly in that way.  But first things first. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And so, they isolate me in the hospital.  From the working rush, from hundreds of urgent work affairs and urgent issues.  This was the first small step. <br><br>  I could not solve any serious questions from the hospital, even the Internet there almost did not work.  Slowly work calls almost disappeared.  The deputies dealt with current issues, and the customers, knowing what position I was in, also tried not to disturb.  Interesting was another.  After the squally first two days, relatives and friends stopped calling.  Everyone knows where, everyone knows that everything is OK with me, I just lie back.  Why call me? <br><br>  By the way, when I was able to walk, I took up a really important issue.  I started to catch a pigeon.  And a few days later, and dozens of different traps ‚Äî my efforts were rewarded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6bb/82f/7b7/6bb82f7b756ee301dab192533fb3da90.jpg"><br><br>  On Facebook about this incident, I wrote like this: ‚ÄúYou grab a pigeon, throw them at another pigeon flying past.  A sort of analog x-box hospital. " <br><br>  But I digress.  At the end of my hospital week, the phone distracted me only a couple of times a day.  But, at this stage, to give up cellular communication and in thought was not.  Inertness of thinking would not allow.  I perfectly understood that the number of calls would be the same one week after my return home.  But life decided otherwise. <br><br>  I am a conservative person and can use one phone model until it begins to fall apart in my hands.  Even so, I take the glue ... well, you get the idea.  A couple of days after the hospital, I went to the cell phone and bought a new shiny phone.  Such an act seemed to me interesting.  And the next day the phone broke down and was taken to a service center. <br><br>  -_- <br><br>  But I could not use the old device either, since Simka was cut off under the new one.  The situation is not hopeless, of course, but, with the purchase of a temporary phone, I decided to wait.  And after 2 days there was a turning point.  During the walk, one of my good friends told about the existence of adapters with microsim on sim.  And that by some miracle, exactly such an adapter, unnecessary for him, lies right now in his house, next to which we were passing. <br><br>  But I thanked and refused.  I liked this growing sense of freedom from an invisible cellular leash.  For myself, I decided that I would wait for the return from repairing the phone and then I would get in touch.  But a week later I made the final decision - I don‚Äôt need a permanent cell phone anymore. <br><br>  As you have already noticed, the path to this decision was not an easy one.  The list of 10 steps, in my case, would start like this: <br><br>  1. Do something stupid; <br>  2. Ensure that as a result of the first step, you cut your back into two parts with showcase glass; <br>  3. ... <br>  10. You abandoned cell phone. <br><br>  And now the main question.  WHY DID YOU, FOOL, REFUSED FROM THE DESKTOP OF THE NEEDED THING?  The longer I was without a phone, the easier it was for me to find the answer.  Now I can formulate it like this: the phone, every day, took at least an hour of my life. <br><br>  1. Minute confirming calls from colleagues and relatives, from the series: ‚ÄúDo you need coffee in a poppy?‚Äù Or ‚ÄúWill you be at a meeting tomorrow?‚Äù; <br>  2. I went to pee - check if they called you.  Called!  Urgent call back! <br>  3. Left from a close person - call me 3 times, say that the brick did not fall.  Forgot to call?  Do not worry - they will call you; <br>  4. Mobile meetings.  In most cases, resulting from excessive caution, in the decisions of my colleagues; <br>  5. Communication with customers, on issues that my subordinates had to decide, not me. <br><br>  But there is still outgoing, the need to make them is a separate topic for conversation. <br><br>  Total, at least one hour per day.  I do not sleep about 16 hours a day, it turns out that one hour takes up the sixteenth part of my life.  This is a lot for such a small thing.  Even seals on the Internet look more useful, it even raises the mood.  A good mood - health.  The phone did the opposite, with time it became the source of only negative emotions.  If they call, now we need to get together and resolve some issue.  Technical, organizational, monetary, emotional.  It is necessary to decide, even if the question is insignificant, and your occupation at the moment is priceless. <br><br>  How did I cope with the need to be in touch?  For every aspect of my life there was a solution. <br><br>  1. The most important.  I'm a little cunning, saying that he refused to cellular.  For many years I have been walking with either a laptop or a tablet.  This is my workplace.  Skype is always on there, you can always find me.  The key difference is that I respond to the incoming message when it is convenient for me. <br><br>  Every day I have periods when I disassemble the issues that have accumulated within a few hours.  This is my job.  Then I parse and skype.  In fact, the distracting calls did not disappear, but were transformed into a convenient format for me. <br><br>  2. If I need to be found right now (this also happens, albeit rarely), the following scheme works: they call my wife, and I absolutely always warn her where I am and with whom.  As a result, you can get in touch with me within 5 minutes.  (Yes, yes, I take advantage of the fact that the others did not refuse cellular communication. If they refuse, I will think of something else.) <br><br>  3. All working questions were painlessly distributed in three directions.  Some of the questions went to Skype and mail.  Part of it is closed by my deputies, not even pulling me over trifles.  Part of it accumulates and passes me, on the same Skype, referent, if I‚Äôm absolutely nowhere without me.  But the latter is almost not needed, insurance. <br><br>  4. What if I need to call someone?  The solution is also very simple.  I always have in my car a charged, but switched off phone with a zero sim card and money on it.  I keep the necessary phone numbers on the Internet, I remember important ones.  From the car I am always in 15 minutes, if further, then I can throw it in my pocket.  Not including.  Used it for 2 months a couple of times. <br><br>  5. There are other aspects.  But all of them are solved without problems.  Even without a tablet or laptop is possible, even though it seems wild. <br><br>  You can still tell how the behavior of people who have been waiting for a call from you is changing, and now they understand that it cannot be.  In a nutshell, it greatly simplifies the understanding.  The excess essence disappears and it becomes easier.  But the article and so it turned out too big.  Here you can just believe me, well, or not to believe. <br><br>  Summarizing, we can say that not always a person has the opportunity to abandon the cellular leash.  It is not always justified and effective.  There are situations when it is absolutely impossible to do.  And I must admit that the emergence of cellular communications has made the world much more comfortable. <br><br>  However, for 2 months now I have not used a regular cell phone.  And so far, I can‚Äôt think of any reason for which I would want to chop off a whole hour from my day.  Think, perhaps for you it is not as fantastic as it seems. <br><br>  Kesha. <br><br>  - <b>UPD</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Why not just stop answering calls?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Could be so.  Both options have their pros and cons. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler"> <b class="spoiler_title">Why not give up electricity?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  1. Any action has a zone of effectiveness.  It looks like this: |  - / ++++++++ / - |.  Words can express it like this: ‚ÄúEverything is good in moderation‚Äù.  In this case, this zone is even in positive phenomena.  Such, for example, as modern technologies.  Or take, for example, medicine.  On the one hand, thanks to ‚Äúemergency medicine‚Äù, a person began to live not 30 years, but 70. On the other hand, modern medicine is a business, human health is not the main thing.  Therefore, tons of chemistry contained in the preparations, on the contrary reduce the life of a person. <br><br>  2. Well, or another example.  Cities are the result of modern technologies, they are effective for humanity as a whole.  However, everyone wants to live on earth in their home.  Since living on earth is more effective for the individual.  The last is a privilege, albeit a departure from modern technologies.  With the rejection of cellular communication is a similar situation.  It is more important to the community than to the individual.  For a person, failure is a privilege. <br><br>  3. From the article it is not immediately clear that she is not talking about the rejection of modern technology, but about the transition from 20th century technologies to technologies 21. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The fare on the red is 1000 rubles fine.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Taxi drivers know this better than we do, but taxi drivers may have large trains of other fines. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Full story for those who are not on Facebook</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  ‚ÄúAnd so, yesterday in the evening, in several places on my back, I sewed up muscles and then skin over muscles.  A pair of stitches settled even on the foot.  Sewn up without general anesthesia, which allowed during the process to talk with the doctor. <br><br>  I will start from afar to slightly clarify the sources of my stupidity.  I grew up in a small town, where there were about 20 abandoned buildings of varying degrees of readiness.  Like any guy who lived in the neighborhood, I spent all my childhood on them.  The love of industrial and abandoned objects remained for life. <br><br>  It is clear that such a hobby teaches a certain caution.  But, as is usually the case, misfortune catches up there and then, when you do not expect it at all. <br><br>  My wife and I decided to take a walk on a sunny summer Sunday.  But I just don‚Äôt like to walk just like that, so we chose the industrial zone of the city, which we hadn‚Äôt been before. <br><br>  I must say that, unlike the city of my childhood, everything in this industrial zone was done normally.  Everything is fenced, everything is under protection and, naturally, my wife and I would not get anywhere. <br><br>  We walked along the fences and almost went back to the city, but my attention was attracted by the gates that were broken down by the roots.  Outside the gate was an abandoned wasteland.  The only object on it was a large brick booth, with showcase glasses on the perimeter with a height of 2-3 human height.  Clearly long abandoned and frequented by local boys. <br><br>  I walked around the booth from all sides.  The main entrance is closed, but there is a broken window on the right of the booth.  More precisely, the lower part of the glass is broken, but the upper one has remained hanging, like a huge guillotine. <br><br>  So that you do not think that I am absolutely bad - the glass was hanging very securely, I jerked it well several times.  Thick, dense, Soviet, firmly standing in the slots of the glass. <br><br>  Inside the outside of the booth is littered with garbage, obviously, so that it is convenient to climb and crawl out.  I am pretty sure that he was the one who disoriented me.  The booth seemed frequented.  And I carefully began to climb.  Then the scene begins, from which a shiver starts to beat me when I remember. <br><br>  Behind a large dense reliable Soviet glass turned out to be the second, similar, only much smaller and hanging under the ceiling itself.  I first heard how it broke and only then was upset that without a t-shirt.  After a second, I find myself inside the booth and feel the water streaming down my legs.  Well, it feels so. <br><br>  There was no time to get upset and think.  Get out of the booth back, cut the leg - to hell with it.  Find a T-shirt from my wife, squeeze my back with power (thank you horror movies).  Reach the road.  On the way, something to joke to appease a loved one.  She also saw it from the side.  Thank God - a taxi.  Crossroads, to our left, get in the car.  And the taxi driver is worth it.  Why?  Because it burns red.  The driver refuses to go to him, saying that the rights will be taken from him.  Well, nothing, now his front seat change.  It was the longest red light in my life.  On the way, a joke. <br><br>  See you soon, thank God, two minutes away (I must say that I was lucky as many times as I needed to stay alive).  Oh, I would give a lot for the picture of the eyes of lovely women from the ambulance.  A guy is completely in the blood rushes in, but he smiles and tries to joke.  I think I came in with the words "doctor, I have a small problem." <br><br>  I must say that the latter was harmful, since they could not move for about 10 seconds.  Rumor has it that so far stories about me go to the hospital. <br><br>  I was in the same place where I held the wall, treated me up and bandaged and taken to the surgeon.  The blood stopped flowing down my legs, this calmed me down a bit. <br><br>  On the way in the car, I tell my wife, so that the children (and everything else) tell me about my stupidity, as it is without lies and embellishment, let them learn. <br><br>  Well, then the hardest began.  Yes, yes, even harder.  I was on the surgeon's desk.  And he said the key: ‚ÄúFirst we stop the blood and then we anesthetize.‚Äù  What is stopping the blood in my case?  Doctors will correct me, but according to the sensations this is so - you get a lot of cotton balls inside the wound, in its office.  Uuuuh, how loudly I pretended not to cry a bit.  But only once a day. <br><br>  - When a person finds himself in a similar situation, he is in a good mood for the first hour.  There is nothing strange in this, considering the amount of adrenaline that is released into the blood. <br><br>  I, in such cases, become completely bad - laugh and joke without a break.  It seems wild to those around me, I suspect that the overwhelming majority want me to make it even more painful so that my behavior finally begins to match my appearance. <br><br>  To cheer up a person who is currently stitching up your muscles and skin is a dangerous business.  Therefore, basically, I got the nurse.  She, at some point, really started to get angry. <br><br>  But, somewhere in the middle of the operation, the adrenaline in my blood ended.  What pleased the surgeon - I stopped laughing and vibrating from this.  It is strange that I generally remained conscious, given that by that time the amount of lost blood was approaching two liters. <br><br>  How do people with local anesthesia feel during surgery?  I do not know about others, but in my case, I got to the table swiftly.  Perhaps that is why, the only desire at this moment is to make the best possible impression on the surgeon.  For some reason unknown to me, it seemed important.  And when I stopped laughing, I started talking to the doctor (having previously asked him permission). <br><br>  What is said pops vaguely.  I only remember what I told him about the water in space, which boils while remaining cold.  He was very surprised.  And it scared me.  It seemed that a person digging inside me should know everything in the world.  And without a certificate of omniscience even close to the living human body should not. <br><br>  It was very sick twice.  The first time, when the blood was stopped, well, I already told.  The second time when the forceps pulled the skin to begin sewing.  Then the local anesthetic act and it became normal.  You don't feel the back, according to the sounds, the feeling that someone is knitting a sweater very quickly with your knits behind your back.  Only for some reason, while you twitch.  At the end of the operation, the surgeon also relaxed a little and began to joke: ‚ÄúOh, there‚Äôs still a wound and we‚Äôd drown it.‚Äù <br><br>  After the operation, when I was carried on the bloodied table down the corridor, the thought came that it was time to make some more jokes.  Having come face to face with some tense guy in the queue, I struck out, looking him straight in the eye: ‚ÄúLife is better than it seems to you now.‚Äù <br><br>  I think he will. ‚Äù <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Why not get a phone for loved ones?</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  I thought about it, discussed it with my friends.  Everyone had the same answer - it does not work.  Over time, your number is again at all.
