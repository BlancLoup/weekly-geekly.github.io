  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yandex has confirmed that social networks have overtaken [porn]</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The company "Yandex" has released the newsletter "Search on the Internet: what and how users are looking for."  The newsletter includes data from September 1997 to September 2008.  The full version (13 pages) can be <a href="http://download.yandex.ru/company/yandex_search_autumn_2008_ru.pdf">downloaded in PDF format</a> , and here we present the pressing of the most interesting facts. <br><br>  Let's start with the most popular recent requests.  Their list as a whole is changing extremely slowly.  The top 10 is not affected by either news or seasonality - we are talking about tens of thousands of identical requests per day.  However, over the past year and a half, the most frequently asked requests to Yandex have changed quite a lot (see table).  This is the first major change in the first ten in several years.  The main reason for these changes is the emergence and immense popularity of social networks.  For the first time in several years, the request [porn] has ceased to be the most popular, yielding to the demands of [classmates] and [in contact].  The top 50 most frequent requests in August 2008 include twelve requests related to social networks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c0c/e8d/f75/c0ce8df757765c629d3e64354793c737.gif"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, the most popular requests - only a very small part of all requests to search.  As of August 2008, the total number of requests from the first hundred is about 7% of all search requests (about 1.8 million requests to Yandex per day).  Most normal queries are quite rare - each of them is given less than a hundred times a day.  It is these low-frequency queries that make up three quarters of the search queries (more than 20 million per day).

The average user spends less than five minutes searching for the right answer at a time.  On the day, the user accesses the search once or twice and makes five requests.  According to Yandex, an estimated 48 million queries per day are assigned to the Runet search engines (with a daily review of search results pages more than 63 million times). <br><br>  A typical search query consists of two or three nouns written <br>  Cyrillic.  For example, [abstract psychology].  The average search query length is 2.5 words.  Compared to 1997, queries have become twice as long - then the average query consisted of only 1.2 words. <br><br>  Most users do not allow themselves rudeness with a search engine - a relatively small number of queries - one and a half percent - contain obscene vocabulary. <br><br>  Russian-speaking users mostly write their queries to the search in Cyrillic (more than 72% of the queries).  About 15% of queries are written in Latin letters, and about 11% contain both Cyrillic and Latin characters.  Just over 1% are requests from numbers alone, empty or meaningless. <br><br>  14-15% of all requests contain various errors and distortions.  Two thirds of all errors are spelling (missing letters, incorrect spelling of words, etc.).  The most common mistake now - [classmates] (with one with).  This request is in the top 10 requests to Yandex in August 2008. For some users, the browser‚Äôs address bar does not exist, so they enter website addresses in the search bar.  There are enough such requests - about 4%. <br><br>  According to the search queries, it is possible to understand which users choose the way of writing the words that have recently appeared in Russian.  The options [tag] 26425, [brand] 51333 and [trend] 7986 finally won the options [tag] 7986, [brand] 7704 and [trend] 361. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42554/</a></p>
