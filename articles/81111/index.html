  <section class="page js-page"><h1>SUP, don't be evil!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago, I wrote another bike for reading Friendlet LJ in Google Reader and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/50768/">watched</a> it on Habr√©.  Now the service is used by about 150-200 people, not much but not so little - such a small unorganized crowd.  At first, even one developer from SUP asked me what bugs I found in LiveJournal and, moreover, some of these bugs were fixed.  And on September 30, 2009 the service was temporarily banned for the first time. <br>  And then the story about Sup, Tor, the FSB and how the bloody GeBnya and anime are in charge of everything. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As an honest code-maker, I wrote a question to webmaster@livejournal.com: ‚ÄúWhat is the real thing?‚Äù  A couple of days from the support, the fish came with the answer: "What is your User-Agent, external IP and did you read <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/bots/">bot policy</a> ?" <br><br>  I read the bot policy, of course, but when the service was just being developed, it was not possible for GAE to change the User-Agent - I brought the User-Agent in accordance with the policy and continued to drink tea with buns.  But not for long.  <a href="http://rss-proxy.darkk.net.ru/sitenews">2009.10.22</a> Forbidden page 403 claimed that my service is no longer violated by the ‚ÄúBot Policy‚Äù, but by the ‚ÄúAcceptable Usage Policy‚Äù, which I couldn‚Äôt find, how much I did not try, but from that moment on, support for any questions via e mail stopped responding.  After a week of silent support, I once again changed the User-Agent and returned to tea and sweets. <br><br>  At that time, in one distant-distant galaxy, the <a href="http://blog.swined.net/">swined</a> also decided to take up cycling and made a certain service <a href="http://lj2rss.net.ru/">lj2rss</a> .  The service was probably technically flawed, generating a flurry of requests for LJ and was also soon banned.  By IP address.  Without hesitation, the swined began to use the <a href="http://www.torproject.org/">Tor network</a> , but the LiveJournal is also not completely bogus - they banned all tor exit nodes, which led to a <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2009/msg00138.html">boiling shit</a> in the spirit: ‚ÄúAh-ah-ah-ah !!!  FSB and bloody geb-nya clicked on the pot with the SUP, which crushed anonymity!  Aaaaa !!!  Now it‚Äôs impossible to write to the oppositionists!  Obama must buy LJ from clawed paws! ‚Äù.  Funny, yes? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      So here.  In order to somehow be able to live with users eager for anonymity, the representative of SUP began to argue that this is all evil lj2rss, which <a href="http://archives.seul.org/or/talk/Nov-2009/msg00146.html">provides for a friend‚Äôs page (normally a <strong>paid service</strong> )</a> .  Our American colleagues in such cases exclaim: ‚ÄúBullshit!‚Äù Why?  It's simple.  We go to read <a href="">LJ FAQ ‚Ññ149</a> : <br><blockquote>  Broadcast feeds of friends: users of paid and regular accounts can make their own style, which functions as broadcasting RSS for their friends feeds.  LiveJournal does not provide embedded feeds for RSS feeds of friends. </blockquote><br>  Translated: well, yes, this is such a paid service, only we do not provide it, i.e.  we provide, but not his, but a set of screwdrivers, vim, templates for perl, howto in English and the 12th version of Lingvo for a howto subscript for everyone.  Or nevertheless each user should buy Lingvo himself - I did not fully understand. <br><br>  Moreover, LJ has a regular OPML generation mechanism with its own friendly brand, available to absolutely all users - from the most basic to everyone else. <br><br>  But back to our sheep.  Having received another ban and realizing that I don‚Äôt have time to get an answer by e-mail, I decided to write to the community <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/lj_ru_support/">lj_ru_support</a> , it‚Äôs also a LiveJournal of Russian- <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/lj_ru_support/">speaking</a> support (be careful, when you click on this link from Google Chrome, the browser says: ‚Äúsmall bottle!‚Äù).  The attempt came out quite successful - I did not miss my message to this pre-moderated blog, but recommended contacting <a href="http://igrick.livejournal.com/">Ilya Dronov</a> , who, though recorded by the <a href="http://www.sup.com/management.html">manager,</a> still did not lose programmatic roots.  In the first letter, he asked me a few technical questions about the service, in the second, December 3, 2009, he wrote: ‚ÄúSorry, I have a very busy week.  I will try to answer tomorrow "- and disappeared. <br><br>  On December 10, 2009, probably something happened, maybe administrators lost autobanil configs, but everything suddenly began to work. <br><br>  A month has passed.  On January 10, tired of the holidays, LJ tech support workers raked open tickets and our all my e-mails sent 3¬Ω months ago.  Well, they responded to this email with an <a href="http://darkk.livejournal.com/55245.html">old fairy tale</a> : ‚ÄúYour RSS proxy is a rule.  For that reason, we will not have to remove this ban. ‚Äù- which, as I showed above, has very little to do with reality. <br><br>  This is where the end of the bewilderment of LiveJournal Psto came to an end - 200 users do not read friendline, there is no normal RSS friendliness and it is not expected, sup does not respond.  If LJ again banned Tor the other day, forgive me, I'm not on purpose.  :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81111/</a></p>
