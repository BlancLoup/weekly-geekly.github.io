This week was opened by projects from Kazan and Yerevan. <br>  At the end of this week, as part <a href="http://startupweekend.timepad.ru/event/9836">of the 2nd Siberian Startup Weekend</a> , Glavstart is planning to discover interesting projects in Novosibirsk - moreover, both at the idea stage, to invest them independently, and at later stages - to publish them on the <a href="http://wanted.vc/">Wanted.VC</a> blog and help, thus, find an investor.  The <a href="http://wanted.vc/project/bringo/">Bringo</a> project, the first in our digest, was found just at Startup Weekend in Moscow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/538/a87/bcc/538a87bccbf8913215d047d5006f98c2.jpg" align="left">  Small offices that deal with important things like plumbing repairs cannot afford to spend big bucks on advertising. <br>  The circle of clients of small offices depends almost entirely on their geographical location and the work of word of mouth.

According to the authors, the trend towards independent development of developers in foreign networks will continue, moreover, will become widespread. <br>  The main condition for such a turn of events is the availability of technology that would reduce costs as much as possible ‚Äî temporal and material ‚Äî and the risks (ideally down to zero).
