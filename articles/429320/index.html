Until the end of November 3, participants unloaded their decisions, and in the next 12 hours they selected the best from their decisions.  Now the choice is for the jury.  At the conference, we will award the winners of the Sberbank Data Science Journey. <br><br>  Participants were provided with ready-made data sets from Sberbank.  All 24 datasets involved in the competition were collected by various departments: the retail unit, the risk unit and the technology unit.  All of them were specially prepared and impersonal.  The basis is information such as: <br><br><ul><li>  Approved limit share </li><li>  Card delivery time </li><li>  Different types of scoring </li><li>  Feedback on the offer card </li><li>  Response to other product offerings </li><li>  ATM breakdowns </li><li>  Information about cash withdrawals at ATMs </li><li>  Account balances and other information </li></ul><br>  For evaluating decisions, the following dataset groups were selected: check (open for participants), public (hidden from participants, but you can see the result during the competition), private (set, which summarizes the competition) <br><br>  In each such set there are three regression problems and five binary classification.  Solutions worked on data sets of various sizes: from 1MB and 300 lines to 1GB and 1 million lines.  Before the start of the competition, the jury prepared datasets, the testing system has already checked them automatically, and <a href="https://sdsj.sberbank.ai/ru/leaderboard">now you can see the results on the website</a> (taking into account the restrictions associated with intrigue). <br><br>  Decisions were taken in the format of archives with a code.  The participants had to build an algorithm that implements a full cycle of solving a machine learning problem automatically, receiving data as input and returning a ready answer at the output. <br><br>  The decisions of the participants were to fit into the specified restrictions: <br><br><ul><li>  resources available to the solution </li><li>  the solution does not have access to Internet resources </li><li>  maximum size of a packed and unpacked archive with a solution: 1 GB </li><li>  The archive is unpacked into a file system in RAM (ramfs) available to the write solution. </li><li>  the rest of the container is read only. </li><li>  CSV with a set of data does not exceed 3 GB </li><li>  Restrictions are needed in order to achieve a fair comparison, putting the participants in equal technical conditions. </li></ul><br><br>  Here is what the evaluation system in this competition is: <br><br><ol><li>  For each task (dataset), the test-specific sample is considered to be a task-specific metric (RMSE for regression, ROC-AUC for binary classification). </li><li>  For each task (dataset), the value of the participants' metrics is translated into a common scale according to the following scheme.  For the best metric solution (among all the sent and successfully tested solutions) 1 point is given, the baseline solution is estimated at 0 points.  Participants who are on the metric between the best and baseline solutions receive a proportional number of points between 0 and 1. Decisions on the quality of the bottom baseline are estimated at 0 points.  If the best solution and the baseline solution coincide, then all participants receive 0 points.  If the participant's decision gives an error on the task or does not pass through the time limit, then it receives 0 points for this task. </li><li>  The final result of each participant is counted as the sum of the results for each task after being converted into a common scale.  In general leaderboard participants are ranked by the final result. </li></ol><br>  The results of the competition are available <a href="https://sdsj.sberbank.ai/ru/leaderboard">here</a> . <br><br>  In addition to the main standings, the participants competed for the prize in the nomination ‚ÄúThe Best Public Solution‚Äù.  Throughout the competition, they published their approaches to solving the AutoML problem on GitHub, and the winners were determined by the number of GItHub stars. <br><br>  At the conference there will be a separate section dedicated to SDSJ'18, where the winners will talk about their decisions and answer all questions. <br><br>  Once again we leave a link to the <a href="https://sdsj.sberbank.ai/">online broadcast of the</a> conference, so that all those interested can watch Sberbank Data Science Day. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429320/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429320/</a></p>
