Over the years I have mastered various rules and principles of design that I successfully apply in the process of level design.  I will tell you step by step how to create an interesting multiplayer map. <br><br>  In this article I will talk about the development of a multiplayer map for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.  Let's call her "Tugurios".  It will be created in the slums entourage.  Now we will talk a little about the history and the setting of the map. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  Tugurios means slum in Spanish.  The map is visually based on the appearance of slums in Venezuela. </li><li>  Gold was found in the hills, so slums appeared next to them, supplying gold miners with labor. </li><li>  Years later, the source of gold was exhausted.  In the face of unemployment, slums have become a staging post for weapons and drugs. </li><li>  When the situation got out of control, the government sent a special forces detachment to solve the problem. </li><li>  The action takes place at noon.  One team spawns in the slums, and the other on the road on the other side of the map. </li></ul><br>  Here is a top view of the map: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f9/8cf/53b/8f98cf53b54843cf8a11ce44398bd73f.jpg"><br>  The map has the following areas: <br><br>  <strong>The hills</strong> 
      <br>

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
    <ul><li>  The hills and surrounding areas will be shown dry and dusty, with a variety of angles and cuts showing the effects of gold mining. </li><li>  All buildings in this area will resemble rusted metal sheds with oaks, which were previously used as service premises. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Ditch</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  The ditch has a mud bottom with water flowing in the middle and vegetation on the slopes and banks.  To provide shelter at the bottom, we will place several large stones. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Slum</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  Small huts of red brick, cinder block and rusty sheets of metal. </li><li>  Everywhere heaps of garbage and waste that can be used as shelters. </li><li>  Some shacks have 2-3 floors. </li><li>  Electric cables hang everywhere. </li><li>  On the walls a lot of stubborn dirt and graffiti. </li><li>  Underfoot or broken concrete with open drains, or green grass with lush vegetation. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Road</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  Place spawn team A. It consists of broken dirty asphalt.  In different places there are cars that provide shelter. </li><li>  It is half a floor or a whole floor above the main ground level, therefore it is invisible from the ground.  The player must either climb the ladder or climb a certain point to see it. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Crane foundation</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  Massive concrete foundation of the crane, which was used in the extraction of gold.  The crane has already been removed, but the foundation has remained in place. </li><li>  It looks like a concrete bunker with bars of reinforcement and rivets protruding from broken corners and surfaces. </li><li>  Upstairs there is a large rounded pedestal hiding one entry point from another. </li><li>  The foundation resembles the concrete foundation of heavy anti-aircraft guns of the Second World War. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eba/47e/4ec/eba47e4ec47a4fc1be2a303e962ac8aa.jpg"><br><ul><li>  Red is the slum area. </li><li>  Small, randomly scattered huts piled one on top of the other, reaching three floors in height. </li><li>  Green is the road zone next to the hills.  Due to gold mining, hills have rugged slopes. </li><li>  The two zones are separated by a deep ditch, marked in yellow.  It has a depth of one floor.  You need to cross it to get to the other side of the map. </li></ul><br><h1>  Height variations </h1><br>  On the map there are many variations of heights.  They are used to overlap the scope and make the map more interesting. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0be/c8c/0bd/0bec8c0bd597405390b938c969ce7587.jpg"><br><ul><li>  The unit indicates the level of the ground or ground floor, which is 10 feet high (about 3 meters) from floor to ceiling.  This will be our reference size.  The ditch is located at a height of 1. </li><li>  Other numbers indicate height in the number of floors. </li><li>  For example, the road is 3 floors above the ditch. </li></ul><br><h1>  Team Spawn Points </h1><br><ul><li>  Special Forces (team A) will spawn in a zone on the road marked with a green spot. </li><li>  Militants (team B) swim in a hut area marked with a red spot. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/461/ff2/3e4/461ff23e41a74716a458104d544fb68c.jpg"><br><h1>  Goals </h1><br>  I have always developed multiplayer Call of Duty: Modern Warfare maps, taking into account the Domination mode.  This is very helpful in creating a well-balanced map, on which one team will not have an unfair advantage over another. <br><br><ul><li>  Three dots on the map, labeled A, B and C, represent the three flags for Domination-style gameplay. </li><li>  Teams can easily capture A and C, because they are near spawn points. </li><li>  Point B will be the hardest to grab and hold.  She is in the middle of the map and is shot through from many positions. </li></ul><br><h1>  Paths </h1><br>  Critical path <br><br><ul><li>  The red line connecting the two parts of the map indicates the critical, or shortest, path. </li><li>  This path is the shortest, but passes through the most dangerous areas of the map. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/287/f4f/ad5/287f4fad5df04abc8e6a6fb85777a898.jpg"><br>  <strong>Flanks</strong> <br><br><ul><li>  Green lines show secondary paths. </li><li>  Both of these paths are longer than the critical, but provide flank positions and bypass the active zone in the center. </li><li>  However, these paths have large line-of-sight limits.  It is easier for snipers to ‚Äúshoot‚Äù targets on them. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7aa/b20/865/7aab208652854ab9beebbe55b7061122.jpg"><br><h1>  Important points </h1><br>  On the map there are several important, or "hot" points, which give an advantage to the team that occupied them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a02/892/fe4/a02892fe49b54b49b95617fe97698ce3.jpg"><br><ul><li>  The first point is highlighted with a red circle.  This is a ledge with a good view of the ditch.  It is three floors above the ditch. </li><li>  Players can watch the ditch from here and from two more hot spots, which will be shown below. </li><li>  This point is more accessible to team A, which spun on the road. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/331/cf2/438/331cf2438e784fe4ab8b4024dbbb9f66.jpg"><br><ul><li>  The point is highlighted in red and located three floors above the ditch. </li><li>  It is only accessible from the rear, so gangster players can quickly occupy it. </li><li>  At this point, you can follow the ditch, the point on the opposite side, and the point in the upper right part shown in the next image. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52c/ccb/2de/52cccb2de72b4a2ea4b0f63c936c711d.jpg"><br><ul><li>  The point is highlighted in red.  This is a massive crane foundation used in gold mining. </li><li>  This point is accessible from both sides of the stairs. </li><li>  At the point you can follow the ditch and it is three floors above it. </li><li>  From here, players can watch the entire length of the ditch and the two other hot spots shown in the previous images. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75a/fa6/2ac/75afa62acf954ed5bc478897305c91cc.jpg"><br><ul><li>  The point is indicated by a red circle.  Here three passes intersect, as well as a critical path. </li><li>  The two-story building on the right side of the point can be used by team A to observe the critical path. </li><li>  Players of the enemy team can go here to the ledge on the left and destroy the players of the friendly team watching the ditch. </li><li>  If the enemy controls this point, he can control the ditch and the dominant point A. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/162/8d3/cad/1628d3cad4414c06b358d4fa2cfdb668.jpg"><br><ul><li>  The point is highlighted in red.  From there you can observe the point of dominance C and the paths passing from the ditch. </li><li>  This is a two-story building that can be reached from both sides by stairs.  A passage at the back of the building can provide a safe road for attacking enemy players. </li><li>  Team B must hold this point in order to keep track of the paths leading to the base, and maintain a point of dominance C with fire. </li></ul><br><h1>  Visibility limits </h1><br>  The visibility limits are very important in multiplayer maps, because they determine the range of capture and control the location of the shelters and AI on the map.  For a better understanding, I indicated the limits of visibility in the map view above. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1dd/72b/f77/1dd72bf7753c49cf84b4d475a117fd03.jpg"><br><ul><li>  Blue cones mark the visibility limits of players from protrusions or from windows of second or third floors. </li><li>  The cones are shown small to simply show the player's angle of visibility.  These visibility limits will be much further. </li><li>  This helps to understand where the windows and other high places are located on the map, and which areas can be observed with their help. </li></ul><br>  Here are a few basic principles of design, they will help you begin your acquaintance with level design.  Later I will consider other design elements, such as the mechanics of shelters, the process of playing the level, the location of weapons and vehicles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/314668/">https://habr.com/ru/post/314668/</a></p>
