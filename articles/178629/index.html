  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Let's make "Roscosmos" a little kinder</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  May 10, 2013 in Australia will be a solar eclipse.  The lunar shadow will pass from southwest Australia to the northeast to the Solomon Islands and go to the Pacific Ocean.  The trajectory of the shadow movement is such that part of this path will be captured by the Russian meteorological satellite Electro-L, which is located in geostationary orbit at an altitude of 36 thousand km. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/28a/e06/1c3/28ae061c3cfeffb175d1d40fe5313f88.jpg"><br><br>  The satellite constantly "hangs" over one point of the Earth and removes the entire visible disk of the planet with details up to 1 km per pixel every 30 minutes.  Thanks to this, it will be possible to follow the movement of the lunar shadow during an eclipse.  But the satellite can shoot twice as fast, i.e.  do 1 frame in 15 minutes.  In this case, it would be possible to make even a short video about how the solar eclipse passes on the planet.  The problem is that Roskosmos is not going to change the mode of the satellite operation - there is no scientific expediency.  But Roscosmos does not yet know about us and about our interest in space.  Therefore, there is a proposal for him to tell about it and ask him to change the Electro-L operating mode. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The shadow trajectory at the beginning of its path captures the satellite's field of view.  But we can trace the entire path of the solar eclipse in Australia: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/807/5bc/72b/8075bc72bf108d75ac8fe5b55c3316c6.jpg">

      Why do you need to ask something from Roscosmos? <br><br>  Almost any post on "Habr√©" on a space theme, sooner or later in the comments comes down to a comparison of NASA and "Roscosmos". <br>  Of course, you cannot directly compare them; NASA‚Äôs budget is several times larger: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56e/216/40d/56e21640ddbb260e34cf2c2b9128dabd.gif"><br>  <i>Source: <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2166159">kommersant.ru</a> (informative article on the topic)</i> <br><br>  But besides a more modest budget, Roskosmos has a lot of organizational and regulatory problems that prevent it from effectively presenting its achievements in the space sphere to the network.  For example, recently, I was surprised to learn that in Russia it is still forbidden to publish satellite photographs with details above 5 meters per pixel received by our devices.  Echo of the ‚Äúcold war‚Äù, which no one is in a hurry to change, despite Google, Yandex and other services.  The reason for this conservative approach lies partly in psychology - historically, the cosmos was considered as the field of activity of the military;  partly in the economic and political model, in which Roscosmos has no direct interest in attracting the attention of citizens to its activities.  The budget is distributed without the participation of the Internet, so its attention is best attracted by the media when the next epic fail occurs. <br><br>  At the same time, many in Roskosmos are dissatisfied with this situation, but for some reason they cannot influence its change.  The inertia of this bureaucratic system is so great that even senior executives agree that popularization is needed, that overseas competitors bypass all aspects, but at the same time even the first persons of Roskosmos do not think about canceling outdated bans or hiring a graphic designer in Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences. <br><br>  I propose to ‚Äúpush the bottom‚Äù of this car, and not to wait until they finally understand that there is such a thing called the ‚ÄúInternet‚Äù and that people there are very interested in studying the Earth and the Universe.  Let's come to them and tell about yourself!  As a trial, I propose to leave a signature on the request to include an accelerated survey on the Electro-L satellite during a solar eclipse in Australia. <br><br>  This can be done in one of two services for collecting electronic signatures: <br>  <a href="http://www.change.org/ru/%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8/%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-10-%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-2013-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2581-%25D0%25B2%25D1%258B%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9-%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9">change.org</a> is a simple registration and signature through Facebook. <br>  or <br>  <a href="http://democrator.ru/problem/11503">democrator.ru</a> here is registration via VC, FB and Twitter, but requires a cell number to sign (if you click "live abroad", you can enter an e-mail in the "number" field). <br><br>  There is not much time left, but this structure is slow, especially our signatures and appeals have no legal force, so the chances of success are minimal, but I think it‚Äôs worth a try.  In fact, these signatures are a list of those who want Roscosmos to make more active efforts to popularize astronautics and domestic scientific achievements, to conduct more open communication with the Internet audience, and often share positive and interesting news.  If this action attracts their attention and they come to some kind of dialogue, in the future we will come up with a more constructive reason for the manifestation of civic consciousness. <br><br>  The initiator was the informal group of the satellite " <a href="http://vk.com/electrol">Electro-L</a> " Vkontakte. <br><br>  Read more about eclipse. <br><br>  The shadow trajectory only at the beginning of its path captures the satellite's viewing sector: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec3/d11/a51/ec3d11a51d9179757df1c132b85bc340.gif"><br><br>  If satellite imagery will be conducted in the normal mode, then 3-4 frames will be captured in the lunar shadow, if accelerated, then twice as much. <br><br>  You can recall the eclipse May 21, 2012 in Japan.  But then the shadow disappeared much faster: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb7/49a/cd8/fb749acd855e50e0c4dfc2568f513d48.gif"><br><br>  No scientific value of the image of the lunar shadow is carried, but in favor of such a shooting, I have only one argument - to see a solar eclipse from space is cool, especially in almost real time, and from our device! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178629/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178629/</a></p>
