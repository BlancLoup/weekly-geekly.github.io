And how much money can be raised on it.  I will say right away - if you are not lazy and live in the city of a millionaire - in the summer month it is easy to do about 100-150 thousand rubles, even without giving up the main place of work. <br>  My specialization was: ‚Äúplastic‚Äù - these are covers of various shares of drinks and beer: sprite, greenbier, all kinds of cola, a bear, three fat men ... you can list all the products on our market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/yv/k9/gnyvk9klubecvw2a7lus91vrex0.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  But, I also did not disdain other actions: cigarette, food, etc. - good, if you "baryzhish" at least one type of code, they are always ready to exchange them with pleasure at any Prizol forum. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/en/ai/ye/enaiyezslsrfdltj_stukwwgsho.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  Of course, like all novice Prizolovs, I first started to collect the caps, unscrewing them, going round all sorts of places in the city, stuffed codes from them and sold them on the forum.  To replenish the balance of mobile phones enough, me and my wife.  But quickly realized that it was not effective.  And I thought, what was it trivial?  Give us wholesale!

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/we/vv/hm/wevvhmq492d2ojgv-xihlgrczxu.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  Imagine the cover with the garbage?  It looks like a lot of plastic, mixed with semi-liquid biomass residues, the whole thing stinks so much that sometimes you can‚Äôt stand a minute of ‚Äúworking‚Äù with this material. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ja/y4/_l/jay4_lj-cnthfrai7_-i09j5mbk.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Here are the steps to work with the "plastic", from the wholesaler - prism: <br>  1. To come to the city dump and meet on the sorting with the foreman or workers.  Agree on the purchase of covers, voice prices, time, other conditions of purchase and exchange phones.  Usually on the purchase of small wholesale paid 50 cop per cap.  I used to make ruble prices.  And in oh-oh-very rare and profitable promotions for 2-5 rubles. <br><br>  2. Leave for the purchase of covers "by call" or schedule.  It is better not on the territory of the garbage dump (so that it is without a fire), but on a neutral territory, even immediately after the dump gate, the main thing is for the authorities not to see, otherwise there will be questions.  Take care of good and tight packaging of the ‚Äúgoods‚Äù. <br>  According to this scheme, it was profitable for me to travel even to the neighboring town for 150 km, once a week, in order to purchase one and a half to two thousand covers <br><br>  3. The most smelly stage: wash the caps for later "digitizing".  In the basins, in the bathroom, in the car washes ... who in that much.  Better with the use of shampoo, any detergent-foaming agent: for cleaning floors, windows, body, car, etc., etc.  The main thing is that all stinking mucus is well cleaned off.  Everything is cleaned from two or three stages, with intermediate and final rinsing in clean (possible technical) water and preferably with bleach. <br><br>  4. Drying!  An important stage, ignoring that, you can still get a hotbed of bacteria and viruses.  Dry under the fan on an absorbent (preferably) substrate.  Come and newspaper)).  And the final stage - processing with ultraviolet.  Naturally.  Just take out for half an hour in the sun and turn it periodically. <br><br>  5. Packing codes (read and translate into digital form).  It is advisable to outsource to a trusted person.  With a volume of the order of 500 covers, you can fill in the codes yourself, an experienced filer can fill this quantity in an hour and a half without being distracted.  With a volume of 1000 pieces and more, it is better to agree with the person who will do it.  During the day of quiet work, you can fill the order of 3000-4000 caps.  Payment here is usually on the complexity of the code (the number of characters in it and the bit) 50-75 kopecks.  Rarely when one code is paid to a filer - 1 ruble.  This should be a very ‚Äúexpensive and complicated code‚Äù in a good promotion. <br>  The typewriter / ca usually comes to your home (then you need to provide her with a workplace: a computer, with a keyboard in plastic, tea with cookies and time to rest, good lighting and lid packages / boxes), or take the lids to the house. <br><br>  6. Collection of codes and covers (in case the employee works from her home).  In our age, oddly enough, not everyone still uses email.  Therefore, it is better to call in codes with a flash drive. <br>  In this form, ‚Äúcodes are typed, for example,‚Äú sprite ‚Äùinto a textbook, for subsequent automatic blocking into the account: <br>  Z36LKLK2M <br>  Z863W88HH <br>  Z43ALE63F <br>  Z742L37MK <br>  Z2279MK46 <br>  Z337H49N2 <br>  Z4289M64H <br>  Z71KN3P84 <br>  Z76KN3P64 <br>  Z32N97W7M <br><br>  7. Sale of codes on prisolovskih forums.  There is a separate kitchen, but I‚Äôll say that in principle, at the moment of the popularity of the action, there are no problems with the implementation of the codes.  It is important to take into account many factors affecting the supply and demand.  But it is better to negotiate with clients in advance and take the money in advance. <br><br>  8. Sagrivaniya "plastic."  For the Prizol season (half a year), about 1.5-2 tons of caps can accumulate.  Since they are light, then in the amount of this as 2 "Gazelles" download.  You will have to periodically store them in the buffer zone (a balcony, hausend storage, interfloor storerooms, overexposure from friends) ... <br>  And after, respectively, we export all of this to buy plastic.  Typically, the composition of the cover PND - it is bought up by 2-3 rubles kg.  Thus, you practically do not earn anything by selling this recyclable materials.  Purely to discourage the cost of delivery and keep yourself a little benz. <br><br>  9. In case you don‚Äôt sell the codes, but ‚Äúinvest‚Äù, i.e., register all the codes for yourself in the promotion, using a bunch of accounts, emails, SIMs, etc.  - The exhaust is obtained 2-3 times more.  But there are also increased risks: to be blocked by the organizers of the action.  Usually, an experienced prisol does everything automatically: software for registration, clickers, automatic code clocking for accounts in time, a letter or sms collector from various soaps, sims, IP, etc. This is also a separate story.  With me there were (three years ago) only about 15 programmers - promoters at the Prisol forum, who for a small amount of money (or a percentage of the winnings) did it for you, any program, for any site. <br><br>  10. Sales of "prizes".  This is the usual online sale through social networks, forums, Avito, etc.  for 75-80% of the actual price of the goods.  Either through pawn shops.  There are prizolovs who hold pawn shops themselves.  In an amicable way, you should pay an honest tax on the prize, but in my practice this was not the case.  The organizer of the action submits to the tax data about the winner only if the prize is very expensive: a car, an apartment and the like. <br><br>  That's basically it.  Now this ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù has subsided a bit.  A lot of money does not raise.  Although there are still wholesalers prisol-promoters, programmers who get involved in the action and not bad "raises".  But that's another story. <br>  Next time, I‚Äôll talk about the theft and marketing of codes from printing houses where stickers and packaging are printed for various stocks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/443814/">https://habr.com/ru/post/443814/</a></p>
