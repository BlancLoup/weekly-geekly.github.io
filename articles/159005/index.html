      Sometimes it is mistakenly considered that the launch is the most difficult.  This, to put it mildly, is not so.  The real work begins after launch. <br><br>  The team, sincerely confident in the quality of its project, is waiting for a vertical rise in sales with asymptote to infinity ... But usually it turns out more like New Year's fireworks - a short rise, a rapid fall and forgetfulness. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The insidious B and C are to blame for everything. Our application competes with other applications in the top for the user's attention.  If competitors have better performance, you fall.  The lower you fell - the less you have views, the more difficult it is to climb back.  Your Appeal (B and C) should be better than your competitors.  If you lose more than 3-4 positions a day - you have a bad Appeal. <br><br>  We must also remember that almost all applications in the top regularly use advertising, PR and purchase installations.  So, to make money, we need not just to be better - we need to be damn better. <br><br>  B is the conversion of top views into the page views of our application.  It depends on just 3 things: <br><br><ul><li>  Price </li><li>  Icon </li><li>  Title </li></ul><br><br>  Anything more there is nothing.  No matter how much money you invested, what a cool graphics and mechanics.  Only these 3 parameters. <br><br><h5>  Price </h5><br><ul><li>  Free application download 20-25 times more than the application for $ 0.99. </li><li>  $ 1.99 - an average of two times less than 0.99 </li><li>  If the application costs $ 3 - it will be downloaded on average 70-150 times less than if it were free. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Title </h5><br>  Ideally, it should be a brand in itself.  But where to get on all brands?  If we discard the dubious path of mimicry under the existing ones (for example Temple Fun), then the name will have to be invented by ourselves. <br><br><ul><li>  The name should be clear </li><li>  It should be understandable by the first 6 letters.  Since the cute inscription "free" cuts off everything else.  Accordingly, if you are not in the top ten, then most likely your name will simply be lost. </li><li>  The name should be attractive </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Icon </h5><br>  I will cite the internal dialogue that I have to carry on with myself when the cost of developing an icon begins to roll in a couple thousand rubles. <br><br>  - No, there are no perfect icons. <br>  - Yes, the icon will have to change. <br>  - Yes, she will have to change again <br>  - No, the icons are really different. <br>  - yes it makes sense <br><br>  The correct icon is a process.  This is, in general, an almost continuous search.  Correctly selected icon increases the number of downloads at times. <br><br>  If you managed to drive the user to the application page - the work ‚ÄúC‚Äù begins. <br>  C - conversion of viewing the page of your application in the download. <br><br>  Play a role: <br><ul><li>  The first couple of screenshots </li><li>  The first paragraph of the description </li><li>  The number of ratings and the average rating. </li></ul><br><br>  Much less: <br><ul><li>  The rest of the description text </li><li>  Remaining screenshots </li><li>  Reviews </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Bad advice ‚Ññ1 </h4><br><ol><li>  Select a test market and run on it.  Throw out the application in TOP and then torment Appeal until you get an acceptable result. </li><li>  Make 10 options icons.  And test on a large sample (50 people at least).  Select 2-3 options and test them on the test market. </li><li>  Also do with the name.  In Russia, they do not know English.  In France too.  In Germany, in general, too.  If you are not a super brand - localize the name. </li><li>  Put the most attractive screenshot first.  The next most attractive is second.  The third in terms of attractiveness is the last.  Do not even try to choose yourself - test screenshots on the sample. </li><li>  The first paragraph should not be an introduction.  It should be the essence of the application and the greatest marketing appeal at the same time </li><li>  Evaluations should be a lot.  They should be great.  In the sense of 5. </li><li>  The reviews should also be positive, real (well, or similar to real), there should also be a lot of them.  This is especially important when starting the application. </li><li>  If the application asks to evaluate it, each will evaluate 50-200 (depending on the quality of the application and the persistence of the request).  Somewhere every 500 - write a review. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Virality  Doctor, will I live? </h4><br><br>  J is an indicator of virality. <br>  Speaking in human words - ‚Äúhow many people will install the application on the advice of one user‚Äù.  As it is easy to guess, if the indicator is more than one, we will observe an explosive, natural growth of the application settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ea/549/043/3ea549043aca31266d8fb8d49413da37.jpg" alt="Virality"><br><br>  A significant part of the Success story is connected just with the high virality of the application.  The application has something that makes the user recommend the application to his friends and acquaintances.  Virality allows you to bypass the faded Appeal.  It does not depend on getting to the Top.  In fact, this is the first indicator that is associated with the application itself, and not with marketing efforts. <br><br>  From the sad - virality, not a synonym for quality.  These two indicators correlate, but only on negative values.  Just a good application may or may not be viral.  Analyze your applications and answer the simple question: why would they recommend it to friends?  Just in case - ‚ÄúBecause it is gluey ...‚Äù - sounds plaintive. <br><br>  The main directions of virality: <br><ol><li>  It is advantageous to call a friend in the application.  Attracting a friend to the application carries bonuses for the user himself (for example, it becomes convenient to exchange documents or the user receives 100 gold coins). </li><li>  I am interested to call the user in the application.  The result that a friend will receive when using the application is interesting to me (‚Äúand he is indeed smarter than me‚Äù or ‚Äúnow I can watch his photo‚Äù) </li><li>  I can brag of the application (from here grow legs at any flashers, and instagram not far left) </li><li>  Honest recommendation - the app is really good, and I advise it. </li><li>  It is convenient for me to call a friend in the application.  The application has a convenient infrastructure that helps to call and lure friends. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Monetization or broth from eggs </h4><br>  H - how much we earn on one installation.  With paid applications, everything is clear - how many installations, and earned so much.  But since a free application is placed 20-25 times more often, simple arithmetic works - if using a free installation we can earn more than 4-5 cents, it is more profitable for us to make the application free.  I do not consider the advertising model, because I do not fully know it. <br><br>  Thousands of articles have been written about the monetization system, and the choice of the monetization system is largely determined by the application itself.  For example, now the mod on F2P systems with micropayments, with high ARPPU, with a good ratio of DAU to the base with a moderate conversion of FU to PU. <br><br>  Therefore, there are reasonable questions that arise: <br><ol><li>  Why does the user start the application again? </li><li>  What else can he buy in your application? </li><li>  How much money can he spend? </li><li>  How the application ‚Äúhooks‚Äù the user at the beginning, not letting him break </li></ol><br><br>  Etc. <br><br>  It turns out somehow very difficult and completely vague.  Therefore, I will just make a few observations: <br><br><ul><li>  Appstore - the territory of low prices.  For 3 bucks you take out the soul.  For 10 - you must be a brilliant application.  As a result, in the Appstore there is no place for average applications with an average price. </li><li>  10 cents from a free installation is a good indicator.  20 is great.  More than a dollar - Eldorado. </li><li>  The average conversion from a free to a paid application is about 4%. </li><li>  On the internal In App, you can earn more, but they are much more difficult to manage. </li><li> You can earn on any monetization system, except bad. </li><li>  If the application is downloaded but not paid, this is already a victory. </li><li>  In the top 200 cash applications - 102 - free.  In the top 10 8 free applications, including the first 4. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Bad advice number 2 </h4><br><ol><li>  The application must earn so much that is enough for advertising and the purchase of installations that allow you to stay in the top.  If the application does not earn so much - try another level of "support". </li><li>  Experiment with the price.  Sometimes increasing the price of an application or in app allows you to earn more, albeit with a lower conversion.  And sometimes it is more profitable to the contrary - a decrease </li><li>  Think of how to increase the average user check in the application.  What else can he buy?  What else can you spend money on? </li><li>  Free application should cling from the first second.  Since, unlike paid, the sale has not yet completed. </li><li>  Run in the monetization system in the test market, as well as Appeal. </li><li>  Lay the mechanisms of virality and the monetization system at the very early stage of the application design. </li></ol><br><br><h4>  And announcing the final part: </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/162121/">How much does it cost to make an application or the whole truth about money</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/159005/">https://habr.com/ru/post/159005/</a></p>
