  <section class="page js-page"><h1>LVEE 2015 Conference. Results</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The 11th international conference of developers and users of free software ‚ÄúLinux Vacation / Eastern Europe‚Äù was held on June 25-28 in Belarus, in the forests of the Grodno region. <br><br>  The conference was attended by guests and speakers from Belarus, Russia, Azerbaijan, Norway, Ukraine.  Most of the participants in the event are guests familiar with the format of the event over the past years, which was reminded not only of memorable T-shirts with prints of past years, but also of communication that immediately turned into informal. <br><br>  Guests were greeted by clear skies and warm summer air, accompanying them all four days.  I do not know how the organizers chose the dates of the event, but they obviously guessed the weather.  Especially beautiful was the early morning.  It seemed that the spirit of something mysterious and unusual flew in the air.  The atmosphere was complemented by mentally selected psychill and psybient (Vitya, thank you!), Which undoubtedly pleased some of the participants who met the dawn and those who were too lazy to indicate the wish of the settlement away from the location of reports, workshops and barbecues were not very happy.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c03/93a/353/c0393a35356848949d3f5d09c81d5ae6.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  LVEE organizers are members of the Minsk Linux Users Group and other active members of the open source community.  The conference was held at the camp site in the middle of the forest reserve.  The format of the conference included reports, short presentations, workshops.  Subjects of the reports included the development and maintenance of free software, the introduction and administration of solutions based on free technologies, features of the use of free licenses.  During the conference, 20 reports were read out and 2 workshops were held, the discussion of which smoothly flowed into informal communication with barbecues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5fb/0ce/196/5fb0ce1963f54294b009a80cf434b0bf.jpg"><br><br>  Thursday was without reports.  Official at least.  Arrival in the afternoon, resettlement, meeting new participants.  Sometimes very funny dating, once again dating.  To blame for all ignoring badges as a phenomenon and a close shave.  It all started with a harmless story that storks are enemies of power lines, and the local canteen and houses have portals in Ingress.  In the following discussion, I discussed why ipv6 is a problem, and RIPE is what it is.  What really ended it - no one will remember. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/19a/114/8dd/19a1148dd5a343069f9cdd8f550528e2.jpg"><br><br>  On Friday, the conference participants heard about cross-platform programming methods, imbued with the problem of reliable links on the Internet, learned about the existence of private data centers in Belarus, talked about creating animation projects with Victoria Babakhina, made sure that aerial photography can be low-budget, and Naim Shafiyev urged not to type new bumps on his forehead and talked about the experience of monitoring everything and everything in your provider.  These and other reports were discussed until the morning by the conference participants, and the topic raised by Mikhail Volchek about building mesh networks did not give rest to many on the last day of the conference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa0/54a/b28/aa054ab285194989ad97ffd6a464c949.jpg"><br><br>  Speaking of pine cones: the bumps are traditionally the symbol of the event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11c/f4c/121/11cf4c1218404513946b04175cc9a6eb.jpg"><br><br>  A serious controversy over the Sabbath day with a discussion on the clock ahead unfolded around the reports of Dmitry Orekhov ‚ÄúData Science for Network Security‚Äù and ‚ÄúMyths and Legends about the OpenVZ Project‚Äù by Sergey Bronnikov.  After the dinner, group photography was a real shock, which this time it was decided to hold on the pier.  Up to this point, it seemed that out of the 120 registered people, even a quarter did not come, but it only seemed that way: gradually, the dock was dropping lower and lower due to the weight of dozens of programmers and administrators.  Someone recalled stories, how one large company seated its employees on a plane in alphabetical order during flights, someone recalled the name of the photographer, and Stas Fomin dubbed this group shooting with the phrase ‚ÄúFeel upstream support!‚Äù.  Nevertheless, programmers soon rushed to retreat to the barbecue and the projector.  Of course, there were many more interesting things, which, I am sure, can be seen by looking at the video later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f46/628/3c3/f466283c3b1b45c5af8e1f497a0bb34e.jpg"><br><br>  The logical conclusion of the conference was the awarding of the best speakers.  This time, according to the results of the voting, Denis Pynkin was marked with a memorable sign from the organizing committee.  The charisma and presentation of Dmitry Samsonov's material was noted not only by the participants, but also by the organizing committee, which brought Dmitry the prize of audience sympathy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f1f/d01/077/f1fd010770aa405aa08a35167ab746c4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f2/dd5/dad/0f2dd5dad8ab4a0b821878811b0d852c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f5/8e1/aa9/3f58e1aa919b40c9a655eb38686942ec.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4b/47e/6e6/b4b47e6e623944ab8143e078bc375762.jpg"><br><br>  The conference was attended by people directly related to projects such as Wargaming, PostgreSQL, ALTlinux, netBSD, nfstrace, Rosa, OpenStreetMap, Maps.ME, Opera Software, OpenVZ, Fedora.  Of course, this is not a complete list. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/614/1ad/2c4/6141ad2c4c5946b1aab8a7bdbc4d04fe.jpg"><br><br>  Support for LVEE 2015 was provided by <a href="http://sam-solutions.by/">SaM Solutions</a> , <a href="https://www.colobridge.net/">ColoBridge</a> , <a href="http://wargaming.net/">Wargaming.net</a> , <a href="http://postgrespro.ru/">Postgres Professional</a> , <a href="http://www.epam.by/">EPAMSystems</a> , <a href="http://mycloud.by/">myCloud.by</a> , <a href="http://www.itspartner.net/">ITS Partner</a> , <a href="http://hoster.by/">hoster.by</a> . <br>  Video presentations, as well as abstracts and presentations later will be posted on <a href="http://lvee.org/">the conference website</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/117448511631448/">in social networks</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0eb/198/194/0eb1981948e7409f9a651f4dd8a9fe88.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261591/</a></p>
