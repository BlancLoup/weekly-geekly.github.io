Unlike traditional telephony systems, VoIP technologies are constantly evolving, which makes it possible to provide new services and updates without increasing their cost.  This is due to the fact that the VoIP protocol came out of the Internet environment, therefore, with the development of Internet technologies, various applications are being developed to expand the capabilities of VoIP applications. <br><br>  Everyone can benefit from using VoIP ‚Äî telephony retailers, small businesses, and even large giants that can easily optimize their communications costs.  In the modern market of telephony with a high level of competition, offers using VoIP services significantly benefit from the tariff plans provided by traditional providers, since besides communication services, many applications are used for data transmission, which helps to improve the information infrastructure of any company, unlike traditional telephony, which is based solely on voice data transmission over obsolete communication channels. <br><br>  <b>PSTN termination</b> <br><br>  VoIP termination enables providers to establish reliable and inexpensive communication between XO IP networks and transfer IP-oriented calls to the Public Use Telephone Network (PSTN).  Using this approach greatly expands the range of services offered by VoIP-providers, and allows you to make calls over very long distances at reasonable prices. <br><br>  Among the distinctive features of VoIP termination are: <br><br>  * Stable connection between the IP network and the PSTN for termination of calls over very long distances; <br>  * Local and international termination services; <br>  * Communication capabilities for both SIP protocol and TDM (Time Division Multiplex); <br>  * Reliable voice transmission over XO IP and Sonus infrastructure; <br>  * NP NXX billing structure allows you to set low prices for LATA / OCN models. <br><br>  <b>Rent to sub-providers (Switch Partitioning)</b> <br><br>  This service allows wholesale VoIP providers and VoIP resellers to lease a switch that belongs to other companies.  As a rule, a part of switch resources is allocated for clients of such providers, which they are entitled to dispose of at their discretion. <br><br>  The use of partization makes it possible to use the best switch on the market, while paying only the minimum price. <br>  rent.  Wholesalers and resellers can use such a switch without capital investments, which can be tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in infrastructure.  By renting a switch, you can earn it now. <br><br>  <b>Calling cards</b> <br><br>  A calling card is a telecommunication credit card that can be used for telephone and mobile communications.  As a rule, the user purchases a phone card from the telephone company or its reseller and gets the opportunity to use its services. <br><br>  There are several options for using phone cards - they can be either pre-paid or post-paid.  A prepaid card is purchased before connecting to the provider, while a post-paid card allows you to pay the telecommunication provider much later - in fact, after the provision of communication services. <br><br>  The advantages of telephone cards include the possibility of distribution through telephone stations, Internet cafes, as well as through Internet websites.  Implementing services with prepaid calling cards provides several advantages, such as cost effectiveness, budget control, mobility, etc.  It is very easy and convenient to use a phone card, since calls can be made either from a landline or mobile phone, or from a payphone. <br><br>  <b>Call Station Callshop</b> <br><br>  VoIP CallShop call centers, also called Public Call Offices (PCOs), use VoIP technology and are positioned as a substitute for traditional call stations, widely represented in all countries.  Such solutions are designed for both existing and potential owners of call offices and Internet cafes, and include special software and a remotely configured VoIP gateway that terminates calls through a network of VoIP providers at attractive rates. <br><br>  <b>Instead of conclusion</b> <br><br>  Of course, this publication contains information about the most popular business models that allow you to earn on VoIP today, but it is possible that your imagination and business acumen will help you come up with a new business based on already known technologies.  In any case, the future is over Voice over IP. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98588/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98588/</a></p>
