This is explained by the fact that such devices are in demand in the automation of warehouse and logistics activities.  Windows TSDs provide ample opportunities for programming and solving various tasks. <br><br>  However, among the devices there is another important difference - the type of system.  Windows operating system is divided into Windows Mobile and Windows CE.  On the similarities and differences of these operating systems, we will discuss in this article, trying to understand the feasibility of choosing one or another version. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Market Overview </h2><br>  Among the most popular <a href="http://www.scancode.ru/">data collection terminals</a> on Windows OS, one can single out a number of models under the brands CipherLab, Motorola, Honeywell.  Today, models for various purposes are actively produced, made in compact cases or, on the contrary, in a massive version for storage needs and high protection class (IP 65, IP66, IP67, etc.).  By and large, their main tasks are in many ways similar: warehouse accounting, inventory, work with accounting software, equipment and shipment of goods.

    <h2>  Advantages over DOS terminals </h2><br><ul><li>  <b>Filling and technical complexity</b> . <br>  <a href="http://superscan.ru/catalog/terminaly_sbora_dannykh/windows/">Data collection terminals on Windows</a> , in contrast to the simpler class of equipment - DOS terminals have more complex technical stuffing and options, such as built-in photo and video camera, voice recorder, various wireless interfaces, etc. </li><li>  <b>Work on RDP</b> . <br>  Windows terminals are equipped with large, high-resolution color displays, which is very convenient for operation over Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).  This allows you to perform tasks on your computer, and manage the process on the screen of the TSD to save resources, increase productivity and mobility of work. <br>  Dos terminals are deprived of this possibility due to insufficient technical characteristics. </li><li>  <b>Support for the .Net Compact Framework protocol.</b> <br>  The .NET Compact Framework is a set of components for running applications on a data collection terminal or other mobile devices. <br>  One of the advantages of CipherLab terminals over other brands is a thoughtful generator of applications that configures the operation of the TSD (supplied in the package).  Before working with the TSD, a warehouse employee can designate a number of algorithms on the computer (detailed information on bar codes, sorting by product groups, etc.), then synchronize the device with a PC and transfer all the programmed conditions and data collection algorithms.  Programming is based on the use of logic and does not require special knowledge.  The libraries for <b>Windows CE</b> and <b>Windows Mobile</b> are different, and therefore the application generators will be different. </li></ul><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af0/e73/6fc/af0e736fc7aa4ce182b0908d63772b4d.jpg"></div><br><br><h2>  Windows Embedded Handheld </h2><br>  The Microsoft Windows Embedded operating system is designed on the Windows Mobile platform and belongs to the family of embedded operating systems in various devices, including data collection terminals.  The latest version today is <b>Windows Embedded Handheld 6.5</b> (developed in 2010 and officially introduced in 2011).  Due to its versatility and flexible architecture, Microsoft Windows Embedded can be used in POS terminals, mobile, embedded and portable devices. <br><br>  A mandatory requirement of this OS is the presence of a good powerful hardware: processor, RAM, etc.  The use of such a system increases the system requirements, and, as a result, the cost of the device itself increases. <br>  The data collection terminals collected on Microsoft Windows Embedded OS include <a href="http://superscan.ru/catalog/terminaly_sbora_dannykh/windows/9142/">Cipher 9200</a> , Cipher CP30, Cipher 9600, etc. All these devices have software for communicating with a PC and working with 1C and a generator of applications supporting Windows Mobile. <br><br><h2>  Windows CE </h2><br>  For the first time, Windows CE appeared on the market back in 1996 as a compact version of Win95.  Since then, there have been a number of significant changes.  Since 2000, this version of Windows has been developed and implemented as a standalone OS.  The main focus was on creating components not for desktops, but for mobile devices, with application compatibility through the <b>WIN32 API</b> . <br><br>  Windows CE and Windows Mobile are not interchangeable operating systems.  A distinctive feature of Windows CE is a modular system, with support for various components, platforms, multitasking.  The advantage of Windows CE is that this OS does not require serious resources to work and is designed for devices with a minimum amount of memory and a simple single-core processor (the minimum for the work of the system core is only 32 KB!). <br><br>  The latest version today is considered Windows CE Compact 7.0.  Among the most popular data collection terminals on Windows CE, recently released should be noted Cipher 9700, Cipher CP55.  Modern trends in the production of equipment for automation assume the presence of different versions, so that the client can choose what is needed to solve the problems of his company.  So, some TSD models are available in several versions on both platforms.  A striking example of such devices can be considered a warehouse industrial data collection terminal Cipher CP60. <br><br><h2>  Summing up: so what to choose? </h2><br>  In terms of speed, these 2 systems are almost the same, although earlier programs and applications on Windows CE worked much faster.  Today, data collection terminals are equipped with powerful productive processors, large amounts of RAM, and a simple user is unlikely to feel a significant difference in performance. <br>  In general, Windows CE itself is simpler in its architecture, has a classic desktop interface (Start button, etc.).  This OS is primarily interesting to developers. <br><br>  And yet it is very good and expedient from the point of view of manufacturers to produce modern data collection terminals on the Windows CE operating system, despite the high popularity of Windows Handheld Embedded 6.5.3.  This is especially convenient for those who have many programs for old terminals on CE and do not want to lose their groundwork. <br><br>  The choice of OS can be explained by the presence of ready-made solutions on a particular system.  For example, the company acquired Wi-Fi drivers for the data collection terminal for 1C Enterprises based on Mobile SMARTS for old TSD.  During use, employees have developed their own work (database with a unique refinement from the programmer, sets of utilities, programs, etc.).  And now, after several years, when the time has come to change the equipment, the question arises of how to preserve these developments and continue the stable, streamlined work.  The software and drivers, as well as the <b>.NET Compact Framework</b> libraries for Windows Handheld Embedded are incompatible with those written for Windows CE.  At the same time, serious financial, time and labor resources were spent on the installation and debugging of equipment. <br><br>  To avoid such situations, manufacturers continue to release data collection terminals to Windows CE, despite the huge popularity of Windows Handheld Embedded. <br><br>  Among the most successful novelties TSD on Windows CE should be noted CipherLab CP55, CipherLab 9700, CipherLab CP60.  Their popularity is due to modern filling, long battery life, wide possibilities for programming and the ability to work in adverse conditions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241585/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241585/</a></p>
