  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PocketBook Pro 612</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  By and large, all e-books can be divided into 3 types: <br>  1. Budget reader with TFT screen, with broad multimedia capabilities, but with greatly reduced communication capabilities and not the most capacious batteries.  That's why they are budget.  You can read a limited number of text document formats, you can listen to music, watch movies or photos, and that‚Äôs it.  They do not have the advantages of the second category of electronic readers - eye safety and low power consumption due to the use of electronic ink technology.  These are the kind of non-PDAs that are a good gift for a child, for example. <br>  2. The second category is e-ink readers.  They are safe for the eyes, consume little energy due to the technology used, as a rule, they allow you to do the same as the first (except for watching video), but in the black-and-white mode. <br>  3. The third category is more likely tablets, with or without a 3G module, with a Bluetooth or WiFi adapter inside, with a touch screen and based on an advanced operating system with a huge number of applications.  As a rule, these are the most expensive devices among all of the above. <br><br>  PocketBook Pro 612 belongs to the second category of devices for reading, however, it has some features and capabilities of devices of the third category. <br><br>  Let's see what this reader can do.

Some are better supported, some are worse, but, in any case, books of the stated formats can be read on this device without much difficulty.  PDF opens quickly, the Samsung¬Æ 533 MHz processor is enough for this, FB2 is nice to read, layout doesn‚Äôt ‚Äúgo‚Äù, like on some more budget books of other manufacturers, and hyperlinks open and correctly. <br>  The functions of viewing files and listening to music are implemented as standard for all books of this type from PocketBook, it makes no sense to dwell on this separately. <br><br>  It is worth mentioning the possibility of voice reproduction of the text - here this function is present and works quite correctly, you just need to set the required language in the device settings. <br>  In addition, the book has built-in ABBYY Lingvo Universal dictionaries, which can be used both simply in dictionary mode and for translating text passages. <br><br>  The book has 2 GB of internal memory, part of which is already occupied by instructions for the device in different languages, as well as preinstalled books, also in various device-supported languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the world. <br>  Due to this, you can check the work of the book with different formats right in the store.  I like the tendency not to print the instructions for the device on paper, but to put them electronically on the device itself, in my opinion, this is the least that a manufacturer of equipment can do to reduce environmental damage.  Plus, the use of recyclable materials in the device and packaging, but this is a topic for another article.  PocketBook does not focus on the environmental friendliness of their products, as some cell phone makers do, but a clear attempt to minimize the damage to nature - on the face, for which a special thank you to them. <br><br>  It is worth saying why I mentioned the features of the third type readers in relation to PocketBook Pro 612. The book has a touch screen, which can be used with the stylus.  To lose the stylus is not worth it, because  The screen does not respond to finger presses.  Nevertheless, all the built-in functions of the device can be used without the stylus, but it will add simplicity when you need to make notes when doing other text work, and also when using the built-in browser, for example. <br>  The book has BlueTooth and WiFi modules, the first allows you to transfer a file to a book from your phone or computer if you don‚Äôt have a sync cord at hand, and the second allows you to download PCC, mail, or just go to the site to view train schedules, for example, or read a couple of articles on Habr√© by connecting to one of the public access points. <br><br>  The built-in battery has a capacity of 1530 mAh, which allows the book to work for a very long time, even with occasional use of additional communication interfaces.  It is worth noting that in a week of testing the book I loaded it only once at the very beginning, and a week later I gave it to the shrunk a little less than half.  This is despite the fact that I read a lot, at least 3-4 hours a day, more often - more.  Yes, and testing of all other functions was energy-consuming. <br><br>  Anyway, I think that this device is suitable for those who need autonomy in the first place, the book is good for long trips, flights and so on.  It will not be able to completely replace the tablet, but will allow you to stay in touch thanks to the built-in WiFi even on the longest trip. <br>  I was surprised by its ascetic delivery of the device, because  for PocketBook it has already become a good tradition to put at least a case into the package of their books, but here only the microUSB sync cable and the book were included in the package. <br><br>  On the other hand, few people use complete headphones, for example, the instruction is embedded in the book itself, which makes it possible to abandon a pile of unnecessary booklets, and the cord will also be able to charge from the computer, especially since charging is not necessary so often. <br>  The built-in memory of the device is also enough for a long time, so that the rejection of the add.  options such as debaucher, printed instructions and a memory card allows you to minimize the cost of the device without compromising its functionality.  Although the cover, of course, is not enough, I want the book to serve as long as possible. <br><br><h5>  So, the pros: </h5><br>  + environmental friendliness; <br>  + price / quality ratio; <br>  + support for a large number of formats; <br>  + built-in dictionaries for translating text; <br>  + text-to-speech; <br>  + touch screen + stylus to enter notes; <br>  + additional modules that extend the functionality. <br><br><h5>  Minuses: </h5><br>  - the austerity of the delivery set (controversial point, but anyway, I put it in the minuses due to the lack of a cover / cover); <br>  - the screen is too small to read PDF; <br>  - The touch screen responds only to the complete stylus, which will reduce ease of use. <br><br>  Well, and finally - a couple of photos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/050/495/8db/0504958dbedd402d5d83ec2236a54fcd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d1c/bb4/2d9/d1cbb42d97e575c211ac6386a2dc7c6f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I hope the review will be useful to anyone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139057/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139057/</a></p>
