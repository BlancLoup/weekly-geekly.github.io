  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Automation of staircase lighting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the most important factors in the comfort of residents of apartment buildings is high-quality lighting in the stairwell.  At the same time, the costs of lighting porches constitute a significant proportion of the total house expenses.  Often, the staircase lighting is carried out by ordinary incandescent lamps, which work, including during daylight hours, and the problem of electrical energy overruns is solved by simply unscrewing some of them. <br><br>  Hence the question about the possibility of organizing the lighting of staircases in another, more economical and technological way.  This problem interested me because I come across it every day and I would like to find a way to solve it on the example of my porch. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Objective: to create a device to automate the illumination of the staircases of apartment buildings. <br><br>  Tasks:

    <ol><li>  To get acquainted with the main problems of organizing the lighting of residential porches. </li><li>  Familiarize yourself with the existing technologies for lighting residential entrances, and select the most economically advantageous device concept that meets the requirements for manufacturability. </li><li>  Design and manufacture a staircase lighting automation device that realizes energy saving goals. </li></ol><br>  Object of study: Illumination of landings of apartment buildings. <br><br>  Subject of research: The reasons for the irrational use of electric energy for lighting the entrances of apartment buildings. <br><br><h3>  Problems of organizing the lighting of apartment buildings </h3><br>  Any entrance of a residential building in accordance with the requirements of sanitary standards must be equipped with artificial lighting.  (¬ß 3.2.2 SanPin 2.1.1 / 2.1.1.1278-03).  As a rule, such illumination is organized using incandescent lamps controlled by a standard switch located on the wall.  Incandescent bulbs are an unpromising and uneconomic source of artificial lighting compared to modern fluorescent and LED lamps.  The situation is aggravated by the inefficient control of lighting, which is usually carried out by residents on their own.  Illumination switches on at the landing with the onset of darkness and turns off (unfortunately, not always) with the onset of daylight.  As a result, there is no reasonable electricity consumption.  The problem can be solved by the use of modern economical light sources, as well as with the help of automation tools for controlling the illumination of staircases. <br><br><h3>  Search for a future device concept </h3><br>  The device for the automation of staircase lighting can be made in various ways from the point of view of circuit design, and from the point of view of the physical embodiment of the final product.  The device can be schematically implemented both on discrete components and using digital integrated circuits, including microcontrollers, as well as ready-made modules. <br><br>  The appearance of the finished device can be made in the form of a finished device that includes not only the automation device itself, but also the lighting device, being integrated with it.  Another embodiment looks like a device mounted instead of a standard switch, or a device mounted in the immediate vicinity of the lighting device, on the ceiling. <br><br>  On the market there are mainly models made in the form of a finished lamp, which replaces the standard lighting device.  That requires the dismantling of the latter and accordingly the installation of a new one.  The samples on the market are equipped with a motion sensor (presence) to switch on the light only at the time of the person‚Äôs presence on the landing, as well as a photo sensor, in order to switch on the light only when there is insufficient illumination, which ensures energy savings when using such automation tools. <br><br>  In this case, the motion sensor (presence) can be performed according to three main technologies: <br><br><ol><li>  Infrared sensor with a fresnel lens. </li><li>  Acoustic sensor. </li><li>  Microwave sensor on the Doppler effect. </li></ol><br>  The most promising from a technological point of view, I see a knowledgeable idea: <br>  The appearance of the device to choose in the form of a complete lamp, which includes an automation device and a lighting device.  This choice is dictated by the fact that: the version of the device made as a unit mounted instead of a standard switch seems to me difficult to implement due to the problems associated with the power supply of the device.  The fact is that since the switch is installed in the open circuit of the power supply of the lighting device, only one pole of the power supply network approaches it, which is not enough for organizing the power supply of the device, and laying the second pole of the power supply network to the switch is not always possible and not technologically .  The option of a finished device in the form of a unit mounted next to the standard lighting device, despite its lower cost, does not seem to me rational because of the complexity of its installation in the presence of hidden wiring. <br><br>  The most rational technology for detecting human presence seems to me - a microwave sensor on the Doppler effect.  For a number of reasons: the microwave sensor, unlike the infrared one, does not impose requirements on the installation site and is capable of detecting movement through the obstructions closing it.  Also, the microwave sensor does not require any additional manipulation (clapping hands), unlike the acoustic sensor.  In addition, ready-made modules of microwave motion sensors combined with a light sensor, the cost of which, due to mass production in China, is low, are on the market of electronic components. <br><br>  From the above, it follows that from the point of view of circuitry, it is most efficient to implement a device using a ready-made microwave motion sensor module combined with a light sensor. <br><br><h3>  Ultimate idea </h3><br>  The final idea is to use a ready-made serial microwave sensor module on the Doppler effect RCWL-0516: <br><br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/XzrTX2q/1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The basis of the sensor based on the Doppler effect is a change in the frequency of the reflected wave due to the movement of the reflecting surface.  The module has a regular ability to connect a photoresistor for organizing control of the module operation depending on the illumination.  The threshold of the light sensor is set by selecting a resistor, a place for mounting, which is provided on the module board.  Also on the module board there is a place for the installation of a capacitor responsible for determining the time period during which the lamp will turn on after the motion sensor triggers.  Thus, the principle of operation of the finished device will be as follows: when motion is detected in the sensor's coverage area, and under insufficient light conditions, the lighting will be switched on for a certain period of time sufficient to overcome the flight of stairs. <br><br>  Technical characteristics of the module: <br><br><ul><li>  Supply voltage 4-28 v DC </li><li>  Current consumption: up to 3 mA </li><li>  Detection range: up to 9 m </li><li>  Transmitter power: up to 30 mW </li><li>  Operating temperature range: -40- + 100  </li><li>  Dimensions: 17.3x35.9 mm </li><li>  Weight: 4 gr. </li></ul><br>  The sensor has 5 pins: <br><br><ul><li>  OUT sensor output (set to logical 1 when motion is present) maximum load 100 mA </li><li>  VIN input voltage + 4-28v </li><li>  GND power input (-) </li><li>  3V3 stabilizer output 3,3v </li><li>  CDS work permit entry </li><li>  CDS pins on the opposite side of the module for connecting the photoresistor. </li></ul><br>  In view of the fact that the module is powered by low DC voltage, it will need a power supply unit.  The simplest version of the power supply, given that the module consumes a small current, in this case will be the use of a transformerless power supply, it is the simplest and has small dimensions and cost.  Also, due to the fact that the device will control the high-voltage load, you need the appropriate actuating element of the circuit.  As a choice of which a powerful field-effect transistor of IRF740 was chosen, the choice was dictated by the correspondence of its electrical parameters to the required as well as low resistance of the open channel of the transistor, which would ensure low power dissipated on the transistor and, accordingly, no need to use a radiator, which will positively affect the cost and weight and size parameters devices.  Total approximate scheme of the device is as follows: <br><br>  <i>Pic.1</i> <br><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Q8jH6y6/2.png" alt="2"><br><br>  Diodes D1-D4 form a rectifier bridge, the pulsating voltage from which is applied to the parametric stabilizer formed by the elements R1, D5, C1.  The voltage of 12 volt filtered by the capacitor C1 (it is the voltage that the Zener diode D5 is designed for) from the output of the stabilizer is fed to the module power inputs.  Since the current consumption of the module is not large at the resistor R5 is allocated a small power.  At the moment the sensor triggers, a voltage of a logical unit appears at the output of the module, which is applied to the gate of transistor Q1, which causes it to open and switch the load. <br><br>  The load device is an LED lamp power up to 10 watts. <br><br>  In this scheme, it is fed unchanged in direction, pulsating current, which, however, does not affect its performance. <br><br>  The finished plastic luminaire designed for the use of modern LED lamps will be used as the finished device case. The polymer material of the luminaire case will ensure the safety of the device due to the use of a transformerless power supply unit in it. <br><br>  The cost of the product does not exceed the cost of industrial products, but at the same time exceeds its technical characteristics, which proves the feasibility of manufacturing this device with your own hands. <br><br><h3>  Self-analysis of the work done </h3><br>  In the course of work on the project, I solved all the tasks assigned to me to solve the problem of lighting the entrances of apartment buildings.  I also happened to learn about the existing motion detection technologies, their differences, strengths and weaknesses.  I learned how to calculate a parametric stabilizer.  I got acquainted with the principle of operation and the distinctive features of field-effect transistors with an induced channel. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/451930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/451930/</a></p>
