Or do not bring the Lord to break your dispenser</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/5c7/301/4c5/5c73014c5e5af9fcd26c11729269fe12.jpg" width="170" height="115" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="left"><br>  Affairs was so.  So, I came out on Saturday evening to take a walk on my beloved Khreschatyk, sit on a warm spring evening under fresh-flowering chestnuts, look at the next revolutionary circus show with shouts, songs, dances and strong alcohol, and just look at people and show themselves. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  On the threshold of central McDonald's, which is near the Khreschatyk metro, he met his old friend, a former classmate and now a graduate student of the Kiev Institute of Nuclear Research, Master of Theoretical Physics, specializing in core theory and deep inelastic scattering in nuclei, and simply good, cultural and intelligent person.  Smiled, greeted, embraced in a friendly way.  And we would have to give it up in a shot glass, to drink pepper elbows one by one, and with pickles and sandwiches with bacon.  But no, they decided not to hurry, but first go to the good-natured McDonalds (there was such an opinion about him), have a little snack, talk about life, and there it‚Äôs like ‚Äúthe map will lay down‚Äù. <br><br>  Came to the free checkout.  Meet, as always, good-naturedly, smiling.  Immediately paid attention to the box for the tubes, with the proud name DISPENSER (I later learned this).  Do not throw off this trinket was quite problematic, as it stood on the very edge, almost hung, but shifted relative to the cash register so that when turning the options to hook it was mass: elbow, tray, jacket, second elbow.  I wanted to tell a friend what would have been more careful, but I didn‚Äôt have time.  The tray gently touched Dispenser, and he, rattling and making noises, flew to the floor.  Due to a blow to the floor at the Dispenser, the top plastic cover was broken.

      What happened next does not fit into any moral or ethical rules of service workers.  Two arkharians with a brazen appearance in a black uniform with an important sign ‚ÄúPROTECTION‚Äù on the back flew up to my friend.  They began to grab his arms and shoulders, pull him to the table, shout loudly and resent.  Very few responded to convincing requests to calm down and talk calmly. <br><br>  The general manager, Dima, who ran out on the first call, was not as good-natured as the cute boys in the good advertisement ‚ÄúI Like All McDonalds‚Äù, and looked at us, like the rest of the workers of this establishment, like Lenin at the bourgeoisie.  Moreover, he immediately said that this little thing costs 500 UAH !!!  (for clarity, let me remind you that the scholarship of the graduate student is 750 UAH), and it is better to give the money right now, otherwise the police can‚Äôt be avoided, and he has already caused a quick reaction squad, as I understand it, because of the special ‚Äúdanger and audacity of our criminal cartel‚Äù. <br><br>  Desperate attempts to prove that our guilt is not much, and anyone could throw off this box was unsuccessful, because all the staff shouted from the edge that it was at least one meter away, and it was unreal to throw it off, and in general they suspect that All this was done on purpose. <br><br>  And good customers, who approached both politely and calmly asserted that they had a similar situation five minutes ago when buying at the cash desk, had the same difference that they had time to catch the ill-starred Dispenser in time, rather rudely explained that not at all, and it is better for them to leave the premises ... <br><br>  A separate paragraph in this article deserves the main manager Dima.  In the course of a ten-minute conversation with him, I was told five times that he was the most important there, and I simply had no place to go above, and he remembered the telephone number of the main office only after my reminder of his existence.  The demand to inform his patronymic and surname sounded a concise and rude answer: "My Name is all that you have the right to know!".  And that is not all.  Please bring the "Book of Complaints" personally in my presence sounded at least seven times.  They didn‚Äôt wait ... Add to this a haughty Nazi look, a sweaty face and about 130kg of weight (McDonald‚Äôs diet makes itself felt) ‚Äîthat‚Äôs a typical image of the managers of this organization.  I suppose that only Asventsum‚Äôs fascists, who considered prisoners to be nonhumans, were suitable for this type. <br><br>  Finally, the long-awaited police arrived.  That's just their correctness and professionalism, I was pleasantly surprised.  Behaved very politely and decently, understood as a matter of fact, were not biased towards anyone.  We were asked to wait on the street until the manager wrote a statement. <br><br>  As soon as we got out and breathed in fresh air, not giving away burnt and stunted meat, or sauerkraut, as in the aforementioned establishment, one of the McDonalds employees approached us and struck up a sort of friendly conversation with us.  He told us an interesting story, saying that you guys all got a penny.  ‚ÄúJust recently - he says - one put up with four thousand flew in (I bring in the jargon in the original), accidentally damaged the glass a little, so the guards pledged his passport and took the rights !!!‚Äù On what basis the McDonald‚Äôs administration allows itself to take official documents as a pledge , and even more so a passport !!!  Or megalomania spills over the edges, or they put themselves above public services !!!  I understand the American school.  Arrogance and arrogance they are taught on courses. <br><br>  Finally, our temporary friend advised to give money as quickly as possible, otherwise, as he said, it will be worse. <br><br>  And here a long-standing picture emerged in memory, which, due to head-clogging with other problems, did not pay due attention to its time.  Under the fragile girl, 20 years old, gently drinking tea in this damn institution broke down an old, time-battered chair.  And she was also quite rudely billed for 600 UAH !!!  What this story ended with, I don‚Äôt know, because the girl, by virtue of her femininity and tact, defended rather sluggishly, and could not do anything with the cheeseburger ghouls screaming and sprinkling drooling, and simply asked them not to shout, and to understand not in front of people.  But, judging by the reaction of the administration, they didn‚Äôt really care that at least a hundred people were sitting on this chair a day, and he could break under anyone! <br><br>  But, then the police appeared with a statement from manager Dima in his hands and invited my friend to go to the regional department to write an explanatory note.  What happened then I do not know, but judging by the morning sms, everything went fine there. <br><br>  Honestly, I have heard such stories in my life quite a few times, but for some reason I did not pay attention, and I never thought that this could happen to me.  Whether the stereotype of McDonalds played its role - as the most good-natured and cute eatery, or the ever-smiling cashiers were misleading.  But that such behavior and the reaction of the administration is systematic and regular - this is a fact, and this leads to some reflections.  I don‚Äôt know, maybe this is how they fuse old things, or they have a separate line in the budget - ‚ÄúDistributing suckers‚Äù.  But it is not a secret to anyone that every little thing at McDonalds is insured, and if this establishment is burned to the ground, then its owners will receive at least twice its cost, and of course for every broken part they will receive insurance.  Therefore, such an attitude to customers is not only surprising, but also annoying to the point of madness !!!  And personally, I was completely disappointed in McDonalds, and I want to give you only one piece of advice: Guys, do not go to these Nazi bourgeoisies, believe me, you are not welcome there, and wild anger is hidden behind cute smiles.  And if they did, don't take in head to behave relaxedly and cheerfully, keep yourself quiet and humiliated, as at a starter in a concentration camp ... And God forbid you break the Dispenser ... <br><br>  Vladislav Sergiev <br>  for <br>  <a href="http://imho.net.ua/2007/04/24/na_chem_zarabatyvajut_makdonaldsy.html">Imho.net.ua</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7465/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7465/</a></p>
