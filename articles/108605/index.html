True, within the land, that is, before the Atlantic.  And if absolutely no geographical details - in Europe.  Yes, we opened a warehouse in the homeland of sausages, Bavarian beer and Mercedes - in Germany.  And this means that now our virtual buyers can safely go on the attack on the online stores of the entire European Union with delivery to Germany.  And such (with delivery to Germany) - the absolute majority. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b5/2e/b52e8455c512d48e86940c9b7266d29b.jpg">

    <h4>  How to buy in the European Union? </h4><br><br>  The question "How to buy in the European Union?" In fact, there are only three main answers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>First answer:</b> you need to buy for money.  Without this, nowhere.  And, of course, not for Mongolian Tugriks, but for euros, which, one can say, dared the face of Europe, francs, liras and other national currencies.  In this regard, we have added the ability to convert dollars into euros through the "Wallet" menu.  In general, those who have always bought through us, have long been accustomed to our internal exchanger.  Just one click - and here you have yen, yuan and pounds.  And now the euro. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/02/cb/02cb10113a42a4f9c064ad453c5de593.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1c/d5/1cd50a4d65275413998f935a1e21ff4b.jpg"><br><br>  The single currency in the EU is a convenient thing.  Bought in France, in Italy, in the Netherlands, assembled in a warehouse in Germany in one parcel and sent home.  The only thing that can confuse the domestic buyer is the diversity of languages.  But if we learned to buy on Taobao, then French or Spanish, German or Italian is unlikely to frighten those who are fluent in Google Translator :) In addition, most sites have an English-language interface, which will completely facilitate the entire process of choosing a product and ordering. <br><br>  <b>The second answer is:</b> it is necessary to buy, as they have always bought, through the ‚ÄúBuy in online store‚Äù form.  Regardless of how you travel to a European Union country in a virtual shopping tour, to place an order, you must copy the link to the product page and paste it into a special field. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/25/7f/257fded48ee3e35a6e9095bd821e60dd.jpg"><br><br>  <b>And the third answer:</b> you need to buy in Euros with a mug of coffee, tea or a bottle of good alcohol, after having prepared or warmed up a delicious dinner :) Stay behind the computer or with a laptop on the sofa.  Call your family members and your beloved dog, what if they, too, want to buy something in Europe? <br><br><h4>  What and where to buy? </h4><br><br>  <b>SALE!</b>  <b>SALE!</b>  <b>SALE!</b>  Germany is a country of discounts and sales.  The Germans, if not a sale, probably even do not go to the shops.  If it were not for discounts, then by and large there would be nothing to buy there, because the prices for the same electronics in most online stores are not very different from ours.  But if suddenly somewhere "discount", then unique and fresh gadgets can get you for mere pennies.  Among those especially loved by Europeans - <a href="http://discount24.de/">Discount24.de</a> .  Their slogan - "Down with the price!".  The company cooperates with many online stores, and thus supports customers in search of the best deals on the net.  A versatile and ever-changing product portfolio offers the customer a wide variety. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/dd/fe/ddfe26b593df348d55e3e3b44bab3842.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Do it yourself.</b>  The Germans are famous for their hard work and accuracy.  Therefore, household and construction tools for home, garden and garage - the brand "horse" of German production.  Among the most popular sellers should be called <a href="http://de.shopotam.ru/shops/obi.de/">OBI</a> and <a href="http://www.hagebau.de/">Hagebau</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6f/64/6f640962f09eacaa9b835051a3c6c665.jpg"><br><br>  These online stores offer a wide range of tools.  The site is welcomed by a hard-working German who ‚Äúpersuades‚Äù to click on the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button and go on an online tour. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/71/c9/71c9d4f7dab3fece1fe47a14e17a9135.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/b3/23/b323e2cad406c34ba7bb213d88280b02.jpg"><br><br>  <b>All for the "six hundredth."</b>  In Russia, even a young child knows what BMW, Mercedes, Audi and Volkswagen are.  These car brands will probably go down in history.  Every second motorist in Russia dreams of a ‚ÄúGerman‚Äù car, if not the first.  The automotive market in Germany is second only to the United States, what can there be?  Of course, it is in Germany that you can find rare and exclusive auto parts, for example, on older models.  And all this is made with love by the most accurate Germans in the silence and comfort of advanced automobile plants.  Here, of course, to help, <a href="http://ebay.de/">eBay.de</a> , where you can find a lot of details not only for the "Germans". <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/d5/5a/d55a9adbc37a15350985931cfc64f76c.jpg"></a> <br><br>  <b>In pursuit.</b>  Germany is a paradise for collectors and lovers of rare things: beer mugs, football paraphernalia, dolls, rare toys for children from all over Europe - all this variety fits on the pages of the German shopping malls. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/29/0a/290a99d8c40d858f4f3beec0ccbf24bd.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/73/7c/737c94e53279c228d77e16069724edcb.jpg"><br><br>  Plus now - it's time for Christmas sales around the world.  And this means that a unique railway for the little ones, a beer mug for the father and the Bosch juicer for the mother will cost half the price. <br><br>  In order to place an order on <a href="http://ebaytoday.ru/">Ebaytoday</a> , you don‚Äôt have to do it in their own language.  So go ahead, friends, to Berlin! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108605/</a></p>
