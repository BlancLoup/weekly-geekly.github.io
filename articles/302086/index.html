      Shake your hand weakly, and you immediately lose a person.  Be careful.  Never make such a mistake. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. Looking to the side while talking</font> </h2><br>  People like it when you look at them during a conversation.  Not through them, not around and not behind them.  They crave your undivided attention. <br><br>  Deprive them of him, and they instantly feel that communication with them no longer attracts you.  This is a vivid demonstration of lack of interest. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. Arm crossed</font> </h2><br>  It is a gesture of dismissal or refusal that keeps the rest at a distance.  If this is not what you are trying to achieve, be sure to immediately catch yourself on it and lower your arms. <br><br>  Moreover, this posture gives a somewhat arrogant attitude.  No one likes this trait either. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">4. Fussiness</font> </h2><br>  These are nervous gestures that speak of anxiety and lack of self-confidence.  They demonstrate that you are uncomfortable, worried or under stress.  And this behavior is very distracting. <br><br>  Try to realize it.  You can put your hands in your pockets.  If you are experiencing severe stress or anxiety, you should definitely <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-nauchitsya-sebya-kontrolirovat-i-nachat-zhit-toj-zhiznyu-o-kotoroj-vy-mechtaete/">learn how to control your movements</a> and prevent fits of fussiness. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">5. Heavy gaze</font> </h2><br>  Looking someone straight in the eyes during a conversation is normal.  But to do it with almost manic persistence is completely wrong.  Such behavior causes discomfort in people and in reality is a sign of aggression. <br><br>  Soften your look.  Closely, for a long time, continuously look into the eyes can only partner in moments of proximity. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">6. Nodding</font> </h2><br>  A nod in agreement is a good gesture, but if you look like a Chinese dummy, this is already a problem.  It is annoying. <br><br>  One or two nods are enough for your interlocutor to make sure you understand everything and agree with him.  Continuing to repeat this gesture, you demonstrate weakness.  Nod endlessly makes the need, desire, almost the need to like. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">7. Using chewing gum</font> </h2><br>  Chew it on the way to a meeting or event, and when you get to the place, get rid of it.  There is nothing worse than listening to someone who is trying to speak with chewing gum in his mouth. <br><br><br>  However, even more disgusting to communicate with those who chew gum and clicks it.  Take the cud out of your mouth before entering the room. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">8. Vigorous gestures</font> </h2><br>  We understood.  The fish was very large.  And the house was extremely spacious.  If you are gesticulating excessively vigorously, people will bypass you. <br><br><br>  This behavior is annoying and annoying.  If you need to revive your story, you can gesticulate more modestly, and at the same time you will still be able to convey your point of view.  Try it. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">9. Kicking or tapping with your fingers</font> </h2><br>  I'm talking about a situation where the whole table at which you are sitting, or the whole chair in which you are located is shaking. <br><br>  This is probably nothing but a small, nervous habit that accompanies your entire adult life.  But how annoying she is!  Stop it! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">10. Constantly glancing at the clock.</font> </h2><br>  You hurry?  Somewhere late?  Need to go somewhere else?  If you negatively answered all three questions, stop looking at your watch.  It is not polite. <br><br>  People will decide that you have more pleasant things than communicating with them.  Do not wear a watch if you can not do anything with yourself. <br><br>  These are just a few things that we do without realizing the impact they have on other people.  When communicating with someone the next time, watch your body language and you will see if you use any gestures from the above list.  If so, try to keep them under control. <br><br>  PS We recommend another useful article on the topic of work on yourself: <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/kak-byt-esli-vas-vechno-nedoocenivayut/">What if you are always underestimated</a> . <br><br>  The author of the translation is Vyacheslav Davidenko, the founder of the <a href="http://testutor.ru/">TESTutor</a> company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302086/</a></p>
