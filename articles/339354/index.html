We are - yes!  But our trip was not tourist in nature, purely professional.  And we visited it virtually, from which it did not become less exciting and exciting.  Today we will tell you about our experience of virtual taxi trips around Stockholm. <br><br>  <i>Company-customer:</i> <a href="http://catchmyflight.se/">Catchmyflight.se</a> <br><br>  Not so long ago, we were approached by a small company from Sweden that transports passengers from Skavsta airport to Stockholm and back. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <i>Task:</i> Launch an advertising campaign in Swedish and English for a small number of foreign language queries.  Geography - the whole world. <br><br>  <i>Indicator of achieving the goal:</i> an increase in the number of calls and taxi car orders. <br><br>  <i>Features:</i> <br><br>  1. A rather narrow sample, because there are three airports in Stockholm, and Skavsta is not the most popular one. <br>  2. The lack of predictive statistics Google AdWords at the initial stage of the work. <br>  3. Ignorance of the Swedish language, difficulty in the selection of key queries and writing informative text ads. <br><br>  The theme ‚ÄúCarriage of passengers‚Äù has its own nuances in contextual advertising.  Based on the theoretical knowledge and experience of working with Russian-language sites of the most diverse areas and geography, we ventured to take on the development, with the client's willingness to help with the translation.  We needed to think through a strategy and put together a puzzle from inquiries, ads and settings in Google AdWords. <br><br>  <b>How it was</b> <br><br>  <i>Search engine:</i> Google.  Toolkit, respectively, Google AdWords. <br>  <i>Geography: the</i> whole world. <br>  <i>Targeting:</i> search queries, both narrow (in translation: Skavsta taxi - Stockholm), and broader (Skavsta transfer, buses to / from Skavsta, etc.) <br>  <i>Language queries and ads:</i> English and Swedish. <br>  <i>The mechanics of interaction with the client:</i> we offered the original variants of the requests, together with the client we considered them, collected the most effective ones and wrote the texts of the announcements.  Working in close conjunction with the customer was not only pleasant and interesting, but also super-constructive. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c31/581/9d4/c315819d44361fcb7db0f331836cd999.png" alt="image"><br><br>  From which devices are most users looking for a taxi service in an unfamiliar city?  Of course, from mobile gadgets.  A Google Analytics report confirmed our hypothesis.  Also, he suggested at what time of day it happens most often: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a9/af4/b7d/6a9af4b7dde77a9a198506b220b634aa.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/200/d98/397/200d98397d3af0aa4bd8ed6f38c36e6f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>What did:</i> put on the data on the shows, adjusted the rates for computers and set up the coefficients for the rates on the time of day. <br>  The result was not long in coming! <br><br>  <b>results</b> <br><br>  2 weeks after the launch of the advertising campaign, the first results were obtained: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/559/872/9ba/5598729bab14106fdf66e1bd16ebadc2.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/420/44a/6ab/42044a6ab7f86397bc8be609d3b1d4d0.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>* Data is partially hidden in accordance with the client agreement.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  We received a well-converting campaign with a large number of hits.  In 90% of cases, the site visitor became a taxi client, that is, ordered a car! <br><br>  <b>Summary</b> <br><br>  The development and launch experience was interesting, but it would be too presumptuous to campaign on a regular basis in an unfamiliar language.  Therefore, we watched for some time, conducted training on the client side, and transferred advertisements to the staff specialist of the company, who speaks Swedish, and basic knowledge to support the campaigns in Google AdWords. <br><br>  <b>Feedback from our client</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúOur startup shuttle bus to Stockholm City Airport was completely new and unknown to anyone in the city.  To get the first stream of customers and become recognizable, we made a bid for contextual advertising on Google. <br><br>  To tell about the advantages of the taxi Catchmyflight.se, and most importantly, to find a way out to the target audience - was the main task proposed for the decision to the Velas team. <br><br>  The offer of our company is unique in that instead of all the usual taxi cars we provide comfortable minivans, which you can easily load large-sized luggage or conveniently accommodate a large campaign.  We pay great attention to the service: helpful and attentive drivers, drinking water and Wi-Fi in the cabin.  We try to take everything into account and make the passenger's journey as pleasant and safe as possible. <br><br>  Velas employees coped with the assigned tasks: from launching the advertising campaign to its pre-setting and issuing recommendations for improvement, everything was done at a high professional level.  A few months later, company managers trained our employee how to keep the campaign running.  And of course, when difficulties arise, they are always ready to help! <br><br>  Our campaign in Google AdWords is working steadily and now, bringing us 80% of customers. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339354/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339354/</a></p>
