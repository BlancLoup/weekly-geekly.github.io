    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So I followed the link and read a mini article on how to get access to the admin panel of Zeus. <br><br><h3>  Breaking - do not build </h3><br><br>  The main points in the admin hack process were to have: <br><ul><li>  Bot configuration file </li><li>  Path to bot gate </li><li>  Config decryptor </li><li>  Exploit for admin </li></ul><br><br>  The last two things were kindly provided by the author of the article, and the already mentioned Wireshark sniffer helped me with the first two points.  It was caught as I mentioned the GET request to the config file and POST on the gate. <br><br>  The article stated that usually the admin panel file is called in.php and lies next to the gate, but I was not lucky and there was no admin next to the gate next to the gate :( It didn‚Äôt upset me because the exploit to the admin panel filled in and executed the php code, I‚Äôm probably embellished a little :) when describing what an exploit (and the article about pouring the shell) allowed to fill up the web, in fact, initially exploit using a vulnerability in the gate and flooded the php code that received the connection data to the mysql database and retrieved the login and password user (s).  Well, since I had nowhere to enter all this stuff, I modified the code of the exploit so that it would flood the web shell and send me mail where it lies and the actual logins and passwords. <br><br><h3>  OWNED! </h3><br><br>  The web shell is flooded, in the mail a letter with login \ pass from users and naturally a link to go.  We go ... rubbed traces of my exploit (php script that sent user data). <br><br><h3>  OWNED part 2! </h3><br><br>  And then I liked that the owner of the botnenta was not particularly worried and everything was with root rights. <br>  In total, I had access to a bulletproof server (in China) and to all of its resources and contents (including the base because I found the root user to mysql again in the admin panel config). <br><br><h3>  Sister, scalpel! </h3><br><br>  Polaziv on a server (if the memory does not change the P4 (1.8) \ 1024 \ 200gb \ 100mbit), cleaning the logs and other pleasures of life, I useful to study further that lives on a web server.  Unfortunately, there was only Zeus and there was: (nothing else to disassemble there was 1 virtual host to which 6 domains were associated with aliases. <br><br>  Okay, we climb into the admin panel ... <br><br>  ~ 2000 bots from CIS countries, ~ 2000 Great Britain and ~ 1000 United States appeared in the admin area. <br>  The admin said that in the last 24 hours about ~ 40% of bots were tapped to it. <br>  In online there were ~ 900 bots, most of all in the UK. <br><br>  Looked at the logs, the bot as it was seen did its job perfectly well.  The stolen data was a lot. <br><br>  Well, especially there is nothing more to tell.  About admin, bot, its work and functionality, I will describe in a separate article. <br><br><h3>  O_o who are you and what have you forgotten here !? </h3><br><br>  Then I got the idea that we must somehow spoil the raspberries so to speak. <br><br>  Having created a new user in the system with root rights, I sat down to think about what to do. <br><br>  The first idea was to notify the protruded users that they are infected (I lie ... first I wanted to enslave the world with this bot army and then save the poor protruded users). <br><br>  A simple .bat file (such as hello world) was written in which there was something "You are infected with a virus, please download and install an antivirus, preferably ESET NOD32" (then I was bursting with pride that maybe I brought ESET hundreds of new clients) 2 files were downloaded for download, in Russian for the CIS and in English for others, respectively. <br><br>  After sitting, I also thought I realized that I would not leave it without a mega-twisted message mesage and I created the site owned.txt at the root <br><br>  the content of which was: <br><blockquote>  owned. <br>  form .ru with love </blockquote><br><br>  ... <br><br>  The next day I returned to look at the stat of tasks for uploading my inform .bat file, I was not particularly surprised that the tasks were deleted, but I was pleased that the number of active bots dropped from ~ 40% to ~ 28% (or 25%, I don‚Äôt remember). <br><br>  Then, for the sake of interest, I looked into the place of harenia owned.txt and saw there: <br><blockquote>  owned. <br>  form .ru with love <br><br>  mate, mate, mate from here </blockquote><br><br>  Then I checked access to root users of the system and mysql they were changed. <br><br>  I couldn‚Äôt conceive anything more than that, and I didn‚Äôt want to. <br>  I registered in the console rm -rf / <br>  and deleted from the server. <br><br>  That's all :) <br><br>  I will be glad to answer your questions and wishes about what else to write from the topic of Malvari. <br>  One of these days will be an article about Zeus in detail. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87217/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87217/</a></p>
