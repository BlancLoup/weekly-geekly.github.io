    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  By the beginning of the first part, I did not have time - but I was completely caught up by more than an hour-long speech by Fyodor Virin (Mail.ru) about ways to monetize Internet projects (which was actually the topic of the conference).  The performance is so brilliant that it is very difficult to add anything to it.  Moreover, Fedor showed knowledge and offline businesses in context. <br>  Probably Fedor lives so well, since with all this knowledge he doesn‚Äôt stir up his startups.  Or (what is believed more) - his character is different, non-accepting, and research-analytical.  But can advise brilliantly :) <br><br>  Between the 2 parts was a coffee break, which absolutely had no problems in order to get to the food and drink and taste it. <br>  Even after the program was completed, I was able to calmly stop by again and have a snack :) <br><br>  And now the actual projects. <br>  All of them want to advise to go to ideablog ... but the site still does not work :) <br>  Enter - to understand the main idea: the most priority thing for a startup is to attract customers (and not the ability to do it), and not an idea, technology or team. <br>  The presentations of the projects talked about everything - but not about that. <br><br>  And the fact that advertising was divided into media and context was rushed, although these are words from 2 different dimensions - the content and the way the ad unit is displayed.  The rulers of the media context would not have endured such abuse :) <br><br>  <b>How doDom</b> ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/akmute/" class="user_link">akmute</a> Alexey Kulichevsky) <br>  The idea is to enable the user to calculate the cost of his apartment, and to do this project.  According to Alexey, the cost calculation is not a trivial process, it is taught for a long time, and it will not be so easy to tear off. <br>  However, doubts about the success of the project appeared immediately. <br>  Optimistic estimates about the sales of banner advertising quickly broke Fedor Virin, and together with Philip Smirnov (InVenture) using the formula ‚Äúperson per day = dollar per month from advertising‚Äù, they estimated the project 5,000 people attendance at $ 5000-10000 of income (in the presentation on the results of the 1st year figure was 20-25 000 $). <br><br>  As for the Lead Generation, it is not very clear how those who value the value of their apartment become willing to buy an apartment.  Apparently, we are talking about evaluating someone else's apartment, and not his own.  But there are far less than a few thousand a day - with all due respect for the size of the apartment market. <br>  And why 5,000 a day is also unclear. <br>  These people can walk and watch real estate news - but not to evaluate (boring). <br><br>  The problem of retaining the audience was voiced - but no solution was proposed. <br>  There is a clear and common solution - turning a resource into an information portal - but it is quite expensive for a startup. <br><br>  And the main thing that is not clear is how the project is going to survive if it is successful.  The creator is not the carrier of the formula used for the calculation, and therefore, as soon as the project becomes more or less successful, it must be declined by the leading players who do not have problems attracting traffic. <br>  Alexey believes that it will be easier for them to buy his project than to repeat - but given the incorporation of a new service into an old working resource, companies will probably find it more profitable to write the service code on their own. <br><br>  Although maybe they will be another Yandex. Auto - we'll see.  In the meantime, it is not clear how the service will differ from the existing analogues when the new version will work. <br><br>  <b>TimePad</b> (Daria Ustyuzhanina).  With the help of the project, the organizers can use the ready-made engine for holding their events, and users can create their own tape of events and learn about updates. <br><br>  It was correctly noted by experts that now people spend time on other resources, and there the events are already in the functional, so it‚Äôs easier to gather users there than to drive them to a new resource. <br>  I agree - although, in my experience, popularizing an application for Vkontakte (seemingly real useful) is still an idea. <br>  The social component of the project has not been told and is not yet clear.  The project was originally made for sale and has already received funding, some of which even could be said to have refused, preferring to finance it on its own, while it is possible. <br><br>  Since he himself was not so long ago engaged in the development of functional events, he shared with Dasha the idea that it would be useful to record on the events on the website of the organizer himself (through an iframe or something else). <br><br>  <b>Ratia</b> ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ookozyrev/" class="user_link">ookozyrev</a> Oleg apparently Kozyrev).  The project is dedicated to the selection of the optimal banking product (loans, deposits) and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/43917/">previously presented at Habr√©</a> .  The advantages of data and usability were mentioned as its advantages.  In this case, no fundamental differences from bankir.ru (in which everything is good and the database is relevant) were not named.  And they are going to maintain the relevance at this stage by the forces of one girl. <br><br>  The project was absolutely rightly advised to reorient to another market, because it is completely incomprehensible how they are going to gain a foothold in this market with such a product. <br><br>  Stories for you (Denis and Olga). <br>  The project is at the stage of elaboration of an idea, but an interesting idea - mood management. <br>  That is, if you want to change the mood - you need to call, you listen to the story and you will be better. <br>  It was quite fair to say that it was rather difficult to draw all this by ourselves, and rather you had to partner with some large content aggregator, which would take all the overhead on itself. <br>  And of course, the cost and share should be such that the aggregator does not have the desire to make a profitable project on its own. <br>  In fact, the site here is an auxiliary tool (for the selection of stories and socialization - but it will probably be more likely to socialize in the same Vkontakte, etc.), and this is not an Internet project.  Despite the fact that ‚Äúhead on‚Äù the project is not copied - the team does not have unique product creation competencies, and if the idea goes, people with traffic will be able to collect stories faster and better.  Perhaps, the non-Internet nature of this service will help - because it‚Äôs not enough to collect the collected stories.  From this point of view, the project is good. <br><br>  I think that much will depend on the discipline of potential users, as far as they get the idea that if they want to change their mood, they need to call.  I expressed this in my question to Denis.  Because one thing is to know something, and the other is to do.  Those who have everything in order with self-discipline - they can manage the mood :) <br>  Others know a lot - but do nothing. <br>  That is, there must be a social effect, so that people from different sides would be reminded about the service. <br>  But on the other hand, people use mobile services ... However, for entertainment, and not for gaining benefits. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44468/</a></p>
