  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The secret of high conversion for online stores</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The goal of every online store is to make more money.  This is generally and understandably, for this, any commercial project is created.  And in order to earn more money, you need to increase sales.  Accordingly, in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãonline stores, sales increase is reduced either to an increase in site traffic (usually by increasing advertising budgets) or to improving the effectiveness of advertising already carried out, that is, within the existing budget.  The result of improving the effectiveness of advertising will be an increase in the conversion rate of the site at the existing level of attendance.  Here, too, everything is clear, we can say that the basics have already been sorted out!  :) <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now the question arises - ‚Äúhow can we actually increase the effectiveness of advertising a site?‚Äù Because nobody wants to spend additional funds on advertising, especially considering that its effectiveness in most cases is at a very low level. <br><br>  There are many different techniques that can improve the effectiveness of advertising on the Internet.  On the net you can read a lot of information on this topic.  But in any case, in order to track the effectiveness of online advertising, it is necessary to use web analysis.  He will help to track all the traffic parameters on the site, help to understand the behavior of visitors, identify its shortcomings and show at what step to purchase a visitor leaves the site or even from a basket full of goods.  As an example, you can give one of the most well-known ways to monitor the effectiveness of the site interface - A / B testing.  But it is used when there is already a sufficient level of traffic on the site and the site owner understands that any innovation should be tested in conjunction with the existing version of the site. <br><br>  However, the most effective method, not even the method, but the initial approach to business, is a thorough design of the site interface. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      In order for the site interface to really have a positive effect on the effectiveness of advertising, to increase sales and conversion, it is necessary to properly design it initially.  This should be done in accordance with the needs of the target audience, while taking into account the paths of visitors through the site, the movement of their gaze and many other factors.  You can also read a lot of interesting materials on the topic of proper website design, and thus, you can independently think through the entire interface and structure of your online store.  It will be completely yours, it is worthy of respect, but, unfortunately, not the fact that it will bring real profit. <br><br>  There is a simpler way.  To understand what a ‚Äúgood website interface‚Äù is, you can take for analysis a few of the most famous and successful online stores in the world.  And since the analysis is always carried out for some purpose, the purpose of this analysis may be to ‚Äúborrow‚Äù any successful ideas or interface elements from e-mail sites dealing with online trading.  You do not need to completely copy the entire site that you are analyzing, you do not need to translate it into your native language, look more broadly.  Walk around the online store you choose.  Starting from the main page of the store and ending with the last step of the order.  Pay attention to how the main page is organized, what elements are put on the front page.  A very important point is the registration on the site, it is important to know whether the online store sells to unregistered users, most likely not, then you need to see how easy it is to complete the registration form.  You should also pay attention to the organization of the basket of goods and the process of ordering.  In general, evaluate from the perspective of the buyer and mark what you like. <br><br>  This is not a complete list of details that can be seen on the websites of the largest online stores.  Here are some of them with the highest conversion rates. <br><br>  <b>Amazon.com</b> is one of the most famous online stores.  Everybody knows him and, for sure, every self-respecting owner of an online store compares his offspring with Amazon.com.  It may not be good to copy the interface of sites of this level, but still, many of the right things are applied to them, and you should at least look at them.  On January 8, 2011, a conversion of 9.6% was recorded, with the level of attendance at Amazon.com - this is just a giant figure. <br><br>  He is rightly considered the number 1 website for online shopping.  Nothing is simpler and better yet.  A few years ago on this site it was possible to order only books, but now - absolutely everything.  It is also important that reviews have been written to almost all goods by customers, so you can always know in advance the advantages and disadvantages of the products you select.  Delivery in most cases is free.  If the order is more than $ 25 and the buyer is an Amazon Prime Member, then 2-day express delivery is always free. <br><br>  <b>Proflowers.com</b> is a <b>well</b> -known website selling flowers and gifts.  Much attention is paid to all possible details on the site, it is implemented just great.  According to various sources, its conversion rate ranges from 14.1 to 26.5%. <br><br>  A detailed study of the process of purchasing the ProFlowers site gave a lot of extremely useful information.  It is safe to say that ProFlowers is a great example of how well to do the ordering process.  Most of the design steps are related to the nature of the company (for example, the opportunity to send gifts and flowers to other people).  Perfectly organized upsell and crossell events.  Although the buyer checks the components of his order, however, during the whole process of placing an order, the goods on the right are displayed in the basket, but without indicating the cost.  This reminds the buyer of the upcoming expenses. <br><br>  <b>Schwan‚Äôs</b> is an online food retailer with the highest conversion rate of 40.6-41.2%.  A stunning result! <br><br>  <b>Vitacost</b> - health products, functional nutrition, dietary supplements, vitamins and the like.  It seems that he seems to be quite a typical representative of this kind of stores, but has an atypical conversion level of 16.4 to 24%. <br><br>  <b>WomanWithin</b> - there is no doubt that selling clothes on the Internet is a huge and still rapidly growing segment of the online trading industry.  Among the majority of online clothing stores, WomanWithin is staggering 25.3% conversion.  This position certainly allows you to earn really large sums in this market. <br><br>  All the listed online stores are more than exemplary. <br>  The article was prepared on the basis of material <a href="http://www.shopping-cart-reviews.com/blog/2011/high-converting-ecommerce-sites-wireframes/">http://www.shopping-cart-reviews.com/blog/2011/high-converting-ecommerce-sites-wireframes/</a> - on this resource you can see graphic materials with the schemes of the used interfaces on the described sites. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128235/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128235/</a></p>
