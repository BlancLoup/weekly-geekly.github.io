      Evernote Hello allows you to save information about people you meet, such as names, email addresses, photos, etc., in three ways, including business card scanning.  Evernote Hello stores contacts in Evernote, allows you to add this information to your address books and can, with one click, send your own contact information to the person with whom you have just met. <br><br>  However, for those who follow the development of Evernote, Hello is more than just a useful tool.  The application has several features that were added as an experiment and may later be included in Evernote or our other applications.  Evernote Hello manager Martin Cheng, when I interrogated him about the strategy, told me: ‚ÄúEvernote Hello was always considered an experimental platform.  This is a testing ground where we try new ideas and options for interaction. ‚Äù  Below I will talk about some of them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e75/bff/edd/e75bffedd209137fdb07d8a6de54659a.png"><br>  <i>Hello Connect allows you to share contact information with people you meet (the screenshot shows the version for Android).</i> <br><br><h3>  # 1: Hello Connect </h3><br>  One of the interesting features of the current version of Evernote Hello - Connect, a feature that allows you to quickly exchange contact information.  She works both for two people and for a group of people gathered (for example, sitting at a table).  When you all activate the Connect function in Hello, one of the devices sends a series of beeps, and smartphones that are nearby and receive it fall into the local group.  After grouping, the names of all participants of the meeting are shown in each other‚Äôs applications, and each user can immediately import all (or some) contacts to them. <br><br>  This function can be used more broadly than just for exchanging contact information.  We are already thinking about using Connect in Evernote Food (to share recipes) and even in Evernote (to quickly provide access to notes, for example, at conferences). <br><br>  We are still debugging technology, privacy control and interaction model, but it seems to us that Connect is a great feature for sending data.  We plan to carry out the development promptly. <br><br>  As a small digression, I‚Äôll say that Hello Connect has evolved significantly since its introduction into the product.  Initially, it was based on the presence of a certain PIN-code, which participants in the meeting shared with each other to exchange information.  This is a good example of how we test capabilities on a low-end product, before thinking about embedding them in Evernote. <br><br><h3>  # 2: Structured Scan </h3><br>  You can add contacts to Evernote Hello by scanning business cards.  Scanning works quite accurately, especially considering how difficult it is to get a good picture from the camera of a smartphone that you hold in your hands. <br><br>  However, just a high-quality text scan is not enough for the function to be useful in this context.  In the case of business cards, you also need to process the data and decompose them into the necessary shelves.  You need to know that this data is a name, what is email, company, etc. Evernote Hello does a good job of this, too, and this technology has already been implemented in several other Evernote applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7b/3d2/48c/e7b3d248cc0e16c702905bc55000d5fb.png"><br>  <i>Hello records information about people you meet and your notes about them (the screenshot shows the version for iPhone).</i> <br><br>  Evernote Food, for example, recognizes recipes, can detect them among other notes stored in Evernote, to display in Food.  We are also thinking about a structured scan of documents in Evernote, which would allow other types of documents that are often saved by users to be processed. <br><br>  The fact that Evernote was created to store any information in most of the unstructured notes does not mean that the service will never learn how to find out exactly what information is located in these notes.  With this knowledge, the application will become more useful for users. <br><br><h3>  # 3: Automatic grouping </h3><br>  Evernote Hello knows that if you meet a group of people at about the same time and place, they are probably all connected with each other.  Evernote uses this context to help users remember these contacts later.  When you search for contacts of a particular person, other people who participated in the same meeting as the one you are looking for will appear in ‚ÄúSimilar Notes‚Äù. <br><br>  Our other applications also started working with a similar grouping.  It is easy to establish links for sets of notes, based on a common place or time, even if you used several devices or applications to create them.  For example, if I make a new appointment with a person on the iPhone in Hello, and after a few minutes I create a note on my laptop, Evernote may assume that these notes are related. <br><br>  Autogrouping becomes even more interesting when working with other people in shared notebooks and Evernote Business notepads.  Automatic creation of tables of contents and digests from a variety of general notes added by colleagues during meetings and at work could open up the possibilities of a collective mind, which, so far, remains a matter of the future.  We think about it. <br><br><h3>  # 4: Man as a data type </h3><br>  Evernote keeps notes on everything.  Evernote Hello keeps notes about people.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa person as a basic unit of information in Hello is obvious, because the application was intended for this, but the data type ‚Äúperson‚Äù may appear in Evernote. <br><br>  We‚Äôre thinking that Evernote will not only help you rediscover the memories you‚Äôve saved in your notes, but also the people who are associated with these notes. <br><br><h3>  # 5: Integration with other data sources </h3><br>  In Evernote Hello, you can enter the email address of the person you met, and the application will find it in your Facebook and LinkedIn accounts (if you provide access to them) to fill in the missing fields in the contact profile.  We believe that our tools should usefully use the information that you save, and not just write it down.  Every person is connected with you in the context of this or that information, and our technologies must be smart enough to see and understand and apply. <br><br>  Evernote apps already use your calendar and location.  We are considering options for future integrations that may make sense, including social media, commercial sites, sensors, business services, etc. <br><br><h3>  Some components of Hello are already in Evernote </h3><br>  Many of the features of Evernote Hello are already used in Evernote.  When you create a new note, and the application automatically generates its title, based on the creation date and location, you use the function that was first tested in Hello.  In the same place for the first time appeared the function of scanning pages, which removes distortions in the photographs of the pages of the notebook.  In Hello, this function is used to align the images of business cards before scanning. <br><br>  <a href="http://evernote.com/hello/">Evernote Hello</a> is not just a product, it is a test platform.  Some features of Evernote originate in Hello, and many future features of Evernote are now being tested.  If you are interested in imagining the future possibilities of Evernote, we recommend spending some time with this application. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181235/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181235/</a></p>
