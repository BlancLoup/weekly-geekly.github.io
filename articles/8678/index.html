  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Design is ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is known that we live in the design world.  This world is changing rapidly today.  Design has already ceased to be the design of the surrounding objective world, it is present more widely.  So, in the West, design turns into a global tool that pushes marketing, sociology.  His task today is the search for new technologies, the birth of needs, the discovery of new directions. <br>  This is in Europe.  In our country, everything is much simpler.  Today we have only talked about the role of design in industry and in public life.  And not only professional designers, but also government officials started talking - without a mention of design, not a single meeting of the government on economic issues is held today. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I would like to consider and clarify for myself (and also I would like to know the collective opinion))), what is the very concept of "design".  The initial meaning of this term is to outline, outline, mark up, mark, plan, outline a plan in mind, purpose, intention, make a preliminary sketch for the construction of something.  / It is already quite clear that the concept is complex / <br>  In today's design literature one can find such definitions of its essence: <br>  Design is a mix of good and beauty ... <br>  Design - a synthesis of art and technology ... <br>  Design is a universal (total) design ... <br>  Design is the humanization (humanization) of technology ... <br>  Design - representing consumer interests in production ... <br>  Design is a sign of a third civilization ... <br>  In the book N.V.  Voronova ‚ÄúDesign.  Russian version "(Russian historian and theorist of art and design), has the following definition: <br>  Design is the design of material objects and life situations based on the layout method with the necessary use of science data in order to impart to the design results aesthetic qualities and optimize their interaction with man and society.  This determines the presence of social consequences inherent in the design, which are also manifested in the formation of personality.  The term ‚Äúdesign‚Äù can refer to the actual project, the design process and its result - the implemented project. <br><br>  Let us, gentlemen designers, speak in simple language.  Because everything is based on simple things / and you, like nobody, understand this /: line and spot. <br>  Design - as a kind of phenomenon, which combined science, art and technology, has a number of signs similar to the features of all three components.  This unique combination and integrity of these features is unique and unique to design. <br><br>  ÔÇß Functionality - how useful the selected object is, informative, functional.  The method of solving design problems is the layout method.

      ÔÇß Aesthetics - in many cases, designers are primarily tasked with changing and improving their appearance, rather than technical improvements.  This is a fee for engagement with beauty. <br><br>  ÔÇß Innovation is not to be confused, or to replace the concept of design and styling.  Substitute the color of the subject, not all.  I would like to see "brain" searches in every volume, in each - the desire for perfection. <br><br>  ÔÇß A certain subjective criterion is an individual assessment of the quality of novelty, wit, unexpectedness of decisions and approaches to things, objects and situations.  / at the level of like - not like / <br><br>  The evaluation criterion, in this case, is a conditionally expressed efficiency, the highest criterion of efficiency of 100%.  The symbol is clear and simple to everyone.  By this criterion, I propose to evaluate any design object, or non-design.  So what is ... design? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8678/</a></p>
