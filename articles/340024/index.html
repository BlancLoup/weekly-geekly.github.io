Does anyone care about the law of Spring?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We conducted a survey of our users on the topic ‚ÄúDo I need a boxed version of a project management system?‚Äù.  For us, the exact answer to this question is of great importance.  Determines the path of development of the system and priorities for new functions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e0/7e/59e07e0833feb294004163.jpeg"><br><br>  The survey involved 155 companies using the cloud version, or simply those who have registered to get acquainted with the system.  There were only three questions, each with three answers.

      Under the cut charts with the results and our findings. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Sample </h4><br>  The sample is not too large (155 respondents), users do not like to receive letters and moreover to vote for something.  The only motivation to participate was the promise to publish the results. <br><br>  The number of respondents for each question turned out to be 50 times more than the number of response options.  The random error of the distribution of the answers will not be big - <br>  a few percent and depends on the distribution of the answers. <br><br>  The essential inaccuracies of the experiment include the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">probability of the sample</a> - only those who wanted it, and not random users from the general sample, voted.  And, of course, the sample itself - in our database there is a bias in a small business. <br><br>  All these factors should be taken into account and conclusions can be drawn from the survey results. <br><br>  <b>Question number 1</b> <br><h2>  Do I need a packaged solution for project management or cloud too? </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e9/de/59e9de2240f77177729426.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>32% of respondents are fundamentally ready to work only with boxed solutions</b> for communication and work with tasks.  If we consider that among our respondents there is a bias in a small business, then 32% is the minimum market share that does not consider SaaS at all. <br>  A few years ago there was no such situation.  We then worked on another b2b project, but the requests for the box were sporadic, they were simply not considered seriously.  Now, having released the boxed version, we have closed the most popular commercial request. <br><br>  <b>Question number 2</b> <br><h2>  What is the main reason for the need for a box solution? </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e8/d6/59e8d69f56bca648605783.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>A strong bias in the security and storage of data at home</b> - more than 60%  And this is for small business!  When you communicate directly with large companies, there security and the box solution are always the first or second question.  (competing with the question: ‚ÄúHow to get a report on what the team did‚Äù) <br><br>  <b>Question number 3</b> <br><h2>  Over the past 3 years, box solutions have become more relevant?  Is the law of spring somehow affected? </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e8/d6/59e8d69f711d4010097044.jpeg"><br><br>  By itself, the law of Spring nobody cares much.  There is no one particular who puts security so high.  It is always a combination of many factors, and users really do not trace changes in these factors.  A typical dialogue with our client looks like this: <br><br>  - We need a boxed solution. <br>  - Why the boxed one?  let's start with the cloud so run faster <br>  - No, now the management will agree only if it is installed on our servers <br>  - And what has changed, because while you use free cloudy Trello? <br>  - Yes, and it does not suit us.  Especially nothing has changed, but now the policy of moving only to safe solutions. <br><br><h2>  Conclusions from the survey and communication with companies: </h2><br><ul><li>  At least 30% of companies are ready to work only with boxes. </li><li>  In monetary terms, this is at least 70% of the market in our case.  The estimate is taken from considerations of the distribution of employees by company size. </li><li>  Over the past few years there have been dramatic changes in security preferences.  This trend will only increase.  Distribution models will be similar to installing bins. </li><li>  There is a trend of active transition from clouds to self-hosted.  We can watch it only in b2b.  We are asked to fill in the functions of the accumulated tasks from the cloud systems to our box. </li><li>  We released the <a href="https://ru.yougile.com/self-hosted">boxed version</a> for a reason.  The direction must be developed.  The cloud is perceived by many simply as an opportunity to test. </li></ul><br><h2>  PS Survey: Agile in Russia 2017 </h2><br>  We in <a href="http://yougile.com/">YouGile</a> conduct a large survey on agile methodology in Russia.  Here you need an order of magnitude more respondents than in the survey above.  So far, slightly more than 100 took part. The most popular answer to the question: <b>‚ÄúIs Agile used in your company?‚Äù</b> <b><br><br></b>  <b>‚ÄúYes, but quite a bit‚Äù - 54.5% of</b> respondents. <br><br>  <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/ZMoSeQRNUfByEN0R2">Take part - pass the survey "Agile in Russia 2017"</a> <br>  12 questions, about 3 minutes <br><br>  The results will be published on Habrahabr. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/340024/">https://habr.com/ru/post/340024/</a></p>
