      Seeing such an advertisement, I immediately recalled the events of a decade or even fifteen years ago. <br><br>  At that time, at the Moscow Engineering Physics Institute (Moscow Engineering Physics Institute), at Moscow State Technical University.  Bauman, as well as in MAI, I taught a course of lectures - how to achieve success in life, how to communicate properly ... (I also had a separate course on sex, because at that time the first edition of my book ‚Äú1001 questions about IT‚Äù was published, and I was known as a ‚Äúfashionable person.‚Äù) There was no lecture so that I would not get a note: ‚ÄúGive advice - which business is better to start?‚Äù. <br><br>  And I gave: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - Organize a computer repair and maintenance company around the clock! <br><br>  Suppose at first you will be only two or three people.  After five to six years, you will have a huge building, with a large fleet of cars, a serious call center.  Your branches will open in all districts of Moscow.  You will become incredibly rich people.  You can call at any time of the day or night, without a break for weekends and holidays.  You will quickly be able to send your employees on the machine for diagnostics, repairing computers, replacing components, installing or reinstalling programs, as well as debugging them ... By telephone, your employees will be able to advise everyone for a fee that is not very high.  There will be a recognizable brand, and hundreds of thousands of people will thank you. <br><br>  They listened to me - and were skeptical of my idea. <br><br>  It's a pity! <br><br>  And the ads ‚ÄúComputer Repair‚Äù and ‚ÄúComputer Help‚Äù still hang all over Moscow today ... But, as a rule, nimble young people are behind these ads. <br><br>  The scheme is simple: there is one organizer, he hires boys and a dispatcher.  Dispatcher takes orders, boys perform.  Eighty percent of the income - to the organizer, twenty - to boys, the dispatcher - a penny. <br><br>  As a rule, computer repairs are carried out by under-trained and not very responsible students.  Software put a pirate, repairing the "hardware" as God put on the soul.  Often, after repairing a computer, it will work for two or three days, and then it will ‚Äúdie‚Äù.  I know of cases when these boys replaced the components.  They pulled out a normal memory, a good motherboard, a powerful video card - and put a weak video card on this place, a cheap motherboard, a memory bar with a minimum volume ... And then they also boasted: "Well, I got lost to the fuckers, I welded on them well ..." <br><br>  And no liability, no guarantee. <br><br>  No one knows how many such unfortunate repairmen in Moscow and other cities! <br><br>  So I am writing here: maybe someone wants to engage in such a business - but to conduct it honestly and competently? <br><br>  I am ready to become a consultant and provide all possible assistance in the organization. <br><br>  Judging by the survey that I did on the site <a href="http://nabiraem.ru/">www.nabiraem.ru</a> , such a service is necessary. <br><br>  Your Vladimir Vladimirovich Shakhidzhanyan. <br><br>  PS Well, if you are curious to see who I am, this <a href="http://1001.ru/video/special/issue13/">is the link</a> .  If the link goes to someone who does not love me (and I annoy many), how much pleasure will this person get! .. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88675/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88675/</a></p>
