Some of them stopped working for some time, began a fun and carefree life, but then they began to work again - in the same area where they managed to earn a lot of money or another. <br><br>  For the majority of not very well-to-do people, this is puzzling - why work, if you are already fine, and don‚Äôt need to think about tomorrow?  In fact, there is a reason for the continuation of work and this incentive is quite powerful. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  An example is the case of one of the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley.  When his company, in which he worked, went to an IPO, the entrepreneur got rich overnight.  As a shareholder, he received tens of millions of US dollars from the company, which allowed him to forget about the vicissitudes of fate for a very long time.  And he himself was sure that he would never work again.

      During the year, he did what he had planned: he went traveling, allowed himself much of what he had previously considered inaccessible.  But a year later, the businessman began the search for a job again - and not at all because he needed it to ‚Äúmaintain his pants.‚Äù  There were no problems with the pants - the wardrobe was packed with them, along with jackets, ties and lots of other clothes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI felt unhappy because of the lack of a purpose in life.  My knowledge and experience were deformed, my skills went away, so it became difficult for me to interact with other people on an intellectual level, ‚Äù <a href="http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20161208-if-you-get-rich-you-wont-quit-working-for-long">said</a> a BBC entrepreneur.  It is for this reason that he decided to start working again. <br><br>  He managed to continue his career, and now he is happier than when he traveled without purpose or meaning. <br><br>  But why?  Indeed, for many people, money is the main goal of the work, in any case, hundreds of millions of people work for money.  If there is no need to think about what to live tomorrow, why work?  But it turns out that a person has a need to be in demand, necessary for someone.  Well, or the need to have a purpose in life.  It‚Äôs not for nothing that tens of billionaires continue to work: Jeff Bezos, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Richard Branson and many others are a vivid example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/496/b45/8d3/496b458d3faa7b05024b90d4e9d729c7.jpg"><br><br>  Specialists who studied the question of the connection of money received for work and job satisfaction, found that this connection is very weak.  Experts from the University of Florida <a href="https://arizona.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/the-relationship-between-pay-and-job-satisfaction-a-meta-analysis">argue</a> that the imposition of zones "job satisfaction" and "wages" is not more than 2%.  In other words, a person can be satisfied with his workplace and is happy to fulfill his duties not at all because he is paid a lot. <br><br>  The thing is that we take the work itself for granted.  But people, according to Jamie Traeger-Muney, the founder of the Wealth Legacy Group, do not understand that we will not necessarily have work tomorrow, day after tomorrow or a year later. <br><br>  Jamie says that 98% of her clients work after they become financially independent.  For many, continuing to work means staying in the comfort zone, doing our usual activities every day. <br><br>  ‚ÄúMoney is a much smaller criterion for happiness and job satisfaction than is commonly believed,‚Äù she says.  In fact, there is a big difference between what we think about our work and money, and how things are in reality. <br><br>  One of the reasons for this is the social status and relevance of a person as a specialist.  For many years, some people feel needed, they know what they are, they know how others treat them.  And suddenly all this is lost, since the person leaves the workplace and does not depend on anything else.  But the question arises: "What to do next?".  Returning to work or continuing to work is an easy way to not lose your own identity as a professional. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe lose status when we stop working, and this applies not only to work, but also to society,‚Äù says Jamie.  And here the situation is equal for a person who has left work, since he no longer needs money and for a person who is unemployed and who has no money.  Both feel ill at ease.  Of course, the first is a bit more comfortable, but the problem of losing status as a valuable specialist still remains.  Work helps to obtain and retain a certain social status.  Lack of work means the loss of this status. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a9e/56b/9dc/a9e56b9dc12aeca5f0af4829b13772c3.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúPeople like to be in demand, they are pleased that they can win,‚Äù says Karen Gordon, an entrepreneur from Texas, who made a lot of money but continues to work. <br><br>  Even the fact of receiving a large amount of money does not help to get out of depression to a person who is used to his work and who for one reason or another has lost this job.  Depression in some cases is delayed for several months.  Often, even a holiday in a comfortable place does not bring joy. <br><br>  Here setting new goals in life and professional activities can help.  If a person has reached the "ceiling", then you can go further and set new goals, which will help you to continue working with pleasure.  All of the above is confirmed by the experience of business representatives, and the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/moikrug/blog/317448/">experience of</a> representatives of the IT sector. <br><br>  For many rich people, work brings special satisfaction, which cannot be compared with the pleasure of relaxing in a comfortable hotel or socializing with other people.  One can disagree with this, but tens of thousands of rich people who work, despite everything, confirm what has been said. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369975/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369975/</a></p>
