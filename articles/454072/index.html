So let's look at the five major misconceptions regarding 5G.

    <h2>  1. China uses technology to spy on God-fearing Western countries </h2><br>  Not.  5G is a new technology, and China is actively promoting it in the wake of its upswing.  He has world-class engineers, and his companies can produce products that are comparable or superior in quality to the products of Western firms, and at a competitive price. <br><br>  And most of all it does not like the United States.  Therefore, according to the trump administration‚Äôs rash anti-Pekin attitude, the US government (with the joyful support of their telecommunications companies) insists that 5G products from China pose a security risk and should not be bought or used. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why not instead buy the good old USA products that have never used the technological advantage and the ubiquitous fundamental technologies to spy on people? <br><br>  It has already reached meetings at industrial conferences where the 5G political component is being discussed.  And this should be borne in mind by governments and large companies. <br><br>  Only this week, the conclusion of the National Security Council of Britain that Huawei does not pose major security problems - and that its telecommunications equipment can be used everywhere except in the most key networks - has led to significant political consequences.  But let's be clear: China does not use 5G to spy on people. <br><br><h2>  2. There is a "5G race" </h2><br>  There is no 5G race.  This is a tricky marketing slogan invented by American telecoms, who themselves were surprised by its effectiveness.  Every member of the US Congress who ever mentioned 5G touched this famous ‚Äúrace‚Äù, and also often used it to explain why something urgently needed to be dragged, or why it was necessary to abandon the usual process.  We recognize it sounds cool - like a space race, only with phones. <br><br>  But this is nonsense: what kind of race can we talk about when any country or company will soon be able to buy the necessary equipment at any time, and install it where and when it wants?  The market is open, and 5G is a developing standard. <br><br>  If there is a 5G race, then there is an Internet race, a race of bridges and buildings, a race of rice and pasta.  Here is how an expert in this area accurately describes the situation, Douglas Dawson: <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); max-width: 100%; width: 500px; min-width: 220px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;" data-tweet-id="1121073755210571778"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br><br>  You cannot win a race if any country can buy radio stations and install them at any time.  There is no race. <br><br>  The next time someone mentions the ‚Äú5G race,‚Äù ask him to clarify what he means, and then tell me to stop talking nonsense. <br><br><h2>  3. 5G is ready to go. </h2><br>  Not ready.  Even the most advanced installations with 5G support - in South Korea - were accused of distorting the facts.  This month in Chicago Verizon launched 5G?  Something no one saw him. <br><br>  AT &amp; T has just dealt with a rival Spring due to the use of the term 5GE - and AT &amp; T quite seriously argued that no one ever confused it with 5G.  Of course, it is - how can it ever occur to someone that 5GE means something other than just 4G +? <br><br>  The thing is that even the 5G standard itself is not yet completed.  There is its first part, and companies are in a hurry to try to implement it, however, there is not a single working public network with 5G.  For now, telecoms are trying to make at least one device work. <br><br>  So keep in mind that 5G still exists in the same sense as virtual reality: it seems to be there, but not in the way that they want to convince us.  Do not believe?  We literally this week were in a Chinese 5G hotel.  And you know what?  No there is 5G. <br><br><h2>  4. 5G covers all our needs for broadband fast internet. </h2><br>  Absolutely not.  Despite the constant claims that 5G is the Internet of the future (and coming from people who are supposed to understand this better, for example, members of the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC)), in fact, 5G, albeit excellent thing, but it doesn‚Äôt replace wired communication. <br><br>  5G signals cannot magically cover vast distances.  In fact, they can only cover relatively small areas and hardly penetrate buildings or pass through walls - so one of the problems is how to install tens of millions of new base micro-stations so that people have reliable signal reception. <br><br>  5G networks will rely 100% on fast wire connections.  Without these lines (it would be good, fiber), it is, in fact, useless, since its only advantage is speed.  In addition, it is unlikely that you will have 5G if you leave the city limits.  And even in the city there will be dead zones when you go around the corner or approach the overpass. <br><br>  Just this week, Verizon's director told investors that 5G "is not a spectrum of coverage" - which in their language means "will not be available outside cities."  The director of T-Mobile said even simpler - again, this week - that 5G "will never get to rural America." <br><br><h2>  5. Frequency range auctions will solve all problems. </h2><br>  Both the FCC and the Trump administration want you to think that a large auction of frequencies will solve all the problems with 5G - firstly, it will be possible to convey it to people, and secondly, Internet access will be expanded in rural areas with the money. . <br><br>  And all this is not true.  The FCC sells an inappropriate spectrum for 5G, as these are the only frequencies that it still has, mainly due to the disgusting work of the US government as a whole. <br><br>  All other countries in the world hold auctions of ‚Äúmedium‚Äù frequencies, which, in fact, allows to achieve high speeds over long distances.  And the FCC is selling at auction a spectrum, the waves of which pass far less, and, therefore, it is useful only in densely built cities, which are already the first in the queue for the introduction of 5G, due to the concentration of consumers and money. <br><br>  Will the proceeds at auction make money in the $ 20 billion investment in broadband Internet for rural areas, as stated by the president and head of the FCC?  No, they will not.  Until something seriously changes in politics, political pressure will not begin to act in the opposite direction, and there will not be political will able to squeeze all-powerful telecoms and force them to deploy high-speed Internet access throughout the US, rural Americans will dynamite. <br><br>  And please, for the sake of all that is holy, do not buy a new phone just because it says ‚Äú5G‚Äù, ‚Äú5GE‚Äù or ‚Äú5G $$‚Äù.  And do not overpay for 5G connection to your operator.  Phones and services will be ahead of the reality of 5G.  Continue to exist quietly, and after five years - if you live in a big city - you will find that you can watch videos on your new phone much faster. <br><br>  And everything else is nonsense. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/454072/">https://habr.com/ru/post/454072/</a></p>
