Trick question.  Depending on the size of the company, profile, history, for each answer will be different. <br><br>  However, there are always several themes that hover in the air.  Remember past years?  Grocery thinking, soft skills, turquoise organizations, ‚ÄúScrum, but ...‚Äù, Adizes, where Agile does not work, where Agile works, and what he thinks about himself at all, this Agile!  It seems that managers and companies are different, but there are topics that are on everyone‚Äôs lips.

      For the <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/program/projects">Projects</a> section on the future of CodeFest X, we tried to guess the main topic for PM in the IT sample at the end of March 2019. Result: let's talk about how a manager can survive in a continuously changing world.  ScrumTrek, Avito, Dodo Pizza, CFT, Magora, ZephyrLab and #agileism will help open the topic. <br><br>  What exactly are we talking about? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãis a popular thing in the IT world.  Time to decision, time to market, time to customer.  We are obsessed with inflating these parameters with nothing to do.  Technology is easier to copy, competitors push, users instantly get used to the good.  All this directly affects managers.  The world is changing, PMU need to adapt. <br><br>  We are planning to reveal the central theme of the Projects section through three blocks of reports: competences, metrics and Agile-2019. <br><br><h3>  Unit 1: Competency Manager </h3><br>  Old-timers talk about the golden times when the manager could draw Gant‚Äôs sausages for months, once in X years read the new PMbok (or simulate) and say to the staff ‚ÄúYou can do better, redo‚Äù. <br><br>  But the world has changed.  Now you need to constantly learn something: either engineering practices, or social ones.  You need to run as fast as you can to stay in the same place. <br><br>  What is useful to be able to manager in this world of increased speed? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63c/bdd/6b5/63cbdd6b52d0e7f0179947f50afbea2b.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Artyom Kalichkin</b> from CFT <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1380">will talk about servant leadership</a> .  Once Artyom got into a mobile development, in which he assessed his level as ‚Äúnot all‚Äù.  People around him were waiting for incomprehensible actions from him, they spoke in an incomprehensible language.  Artyom had to learn quickly.  Rescued the cycle "Trust - Strong Team - Trust - Strong Team" with the rules and restrictions. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/568/ea2/146/568ea2146e25eccaafc5c3687f0d1ff0.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Roman Kvartalnov</b> from ZephyrLab <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1405">will tell why managers mow</a> .  When PMA has overloads and affects, this is due to the lack of some competencies.  What did he lack?  And when you burn out, then what?  Perhaps the problem is not only in him, but in us, in the environment: who hires him, who works with him, and who expects that he will come in silence and fix everything?  We will understand the report. <br><br>  <i>Offtopic: Roma - CodeFest record holder for the duration of the continuous discussion in the expert zone after the speech.</i>  <i>One day, people asked him questions on the subject of the report <a href="https://www.facebook.com/roma.kvartalnov/posts/10210893638394383">for 4.5 hours</a> , despite all our attempts to get him out.</i>  <i>This year, Roma promised to beat his record.</i>  <i>Check it out!</i> <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all">  Ok, let's say we agreed that it is useful to be able to do IT-manager.  How to understand that this set of competencies really brings us closer to the goal?  2019 - time to make decisions in the style of data-driven.  So let's talk about the numbers. <br><br><h3>  Block 2: metrics in the manager's world </h3><br>  We have to admit that there are managerial topics, which we are trying to talk about very carefully at CodeFest.  OKR is one of those.  Everyone tried, some succeed, everyone has questions.  That's just starting to discuss how it immediately turns out that the level of HYIP exceeds the allowable for a constructive discussion.  ‚ÄúBut this is not the case with us,‚Äù and we are falling into an endless argument. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25b/943/8f9/25b9438f9138e847188d6d9c2d586c06.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Egor Tolstoy</b> from Avito <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1379">will tell you about OKR without a HYIP</a> .  Egor turned a tricky trick: he collected statistics for 2.5 years of applying OKR in the work of different teams united by a single business context.  Convenient when you want to see universal patterns. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all">  But the topic of metrics for PMA does not live with OKR. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d15/e2b/ad9/d15e2bad942c6ada5ad2e09c242f1af7.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Dmitry Nefedov</b> from Magora <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1376">will tell about experiments in measuring the effectiveness of managers</a> .  The number of projects and people in teams, the ratio of effective and inefficient production hours, the speed of daily operations, basic attitudes, motivators, correlation with the results of work.  Dmitry and his colleagues measured different parameters.  As a result, they built a matrix of competencies and formulated grades for PMs.  Anticipation: look at examples of artifacts from the report of Dmitry, it is interesting there. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all">  Here we talked about the skills and metrics and got to the third, inevitable block of reports. <br><br><h3>  Block 3: Agile-2019 </h3><br>  Agile Adventure continues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/67b/9b3/4b0/67b9b34b08eb8a02225dcb248760ee8f.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Anton Zotin</b> from #agileism <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1423">will talk about the reference Agile team</a> .  One that exists not because of, but contrary to environmental conditions.  A team that launches the right products is faster.  One in which people and interactions are actually more important than processes and tools.  A team with which you can and should take an example.  The story of life. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ce/f0a/7e9/6cef0a7e966d1caa0f12d51c211695eb.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Anton Bevzuk</b> from Dodo Pizza <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1378">will talk about the practice of using LeSS</a> .  What is the size of the team you imagine when you hear "scaling Agile"?  We can definitely say for how many people in the team we faced the problem of out of sync processes - 10 people, and sometimes even less.  In such cases, scaling frameworks, for example, LeSS, come to the rescue.  In theory.  In practice, everything is more interesting.  Anton will talk about the main thing in LeSS: conditions of occurrence, first steps and limits of applicability. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f8/5b0/9c6/6f85b09c69f4737e27e998a35df5521b.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <b>Anna Obukhova</b> from ScrumTrek <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/lecture/1381">will talk about energy levels for people in Agile</a> .  The story of the fundamental basis for success or problems in Agile - biology.  What is needed to be an effective Scrum Master, Product Owner or Agile Coach?  The correct way of thinking, materiel and breakthrough luck - of course.  But also the energy of it all.  Anna will tell you how not to please the situation when Agile causes resistance or the impossibility in principle to get the desired ‚Äúonly‚Äù from people because we did not think about the energy levels of the participants. <br><br clear="all"><br clear="all">  How can a manager survive in a continuously changing world?  Take advantage of opportunities to compare benchmarks with colleagues, with top companies, IT-community in a broad sense.  <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/">CodeFest</a> will be for you this opportunity, a synchronization point.  For the tenth time in a row.  This is a tradition. <br><br>  Registration is required.  Participation too.  Until March 4, the price is lower. <br><br>  <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/">Join us</a> , it will be cool! <br><br>  P. S. The attentive reader may have noticed that the topic of product management is suspiciously absent in the thematic blocks above, and he is silent about how to survive in a continuously changing world of a special type of manager ‚Äî the team leader.  For these topics we have made separate sections: <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/program/products">Products</a> and <a href="https://2019.codefest.ru/program/teamlead">Teamlead</a> .  A separate section - a separate announcement.  Stay tuned! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441750/</a></p>
