In this compilation, I returned to the original form of the material feed.  Before you there are no categories, and there are only 10 of the best projects of October. <br><br><h4>  10 place </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6df/dd6/008/6dfdd6008a82810074ae56b5e5a8dcf6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.crisisonline.ru/">www.crisisonline.ru</a> <br>  A very topical startup that keeps abreast of the global financial and economic crisis.  The project is also very remarkable by the fact that, according to the developers, it was created in just two days.  A sort of "Startup for 48 hours."  On the project, you can talk about the crisis, read the encyclopedia of the crisis and watch the video on the topic.

      <b>Alexander Zverev (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúYou need to start quickly.</i>  <i>It was obvious to us.</i>  <i>To make a cool portal, comfortable, beautiful and functional - there is no time.</i>  <i>There are enough smart people in runet who want to get ahead of us.</i>  <i>The goal of the project is to create a platform where people can communicate about the crisis.</i>  <i>The crisis is discussed on all popular resources of the runet, which means that a special resource dedicated to the crisis may be in demand.</i>  <i>In addition, the video content, which we will collect for the e-Staff already, can be ‚Äúdiluted‚Äù with questions of the crisis, and individual topics can be mounted. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><h4>  9th place </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b9/709/2ce/3b97092ce6fdf391b78835e12e9e148f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://vmeshke.ru/">vmeshke.ru</a> <br>  Vmeshke.ru is a very entertaining online store.  In it you can buy something, I do not know what.  Ordering a product for $ 10 you will receive it from the project warehouse.  But until the receipt of the goods you will not know what it is.  The only thing you can find out is what other people got who bought themselves ‚Äúa cat in a bag‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Nikolai Kulikov (Founder of the project):</b> <i>‚ÄúSomehow with colleagues we carried out a brainstorming on the topic of interesting ideas for websites, and someone had the idea to sell‚Äú cats in a bag. ‚Äù</i>  <i>Initially - as a joke, but having found an American analogue on the Internet‚Äôs open spaces, they thought that the idea was quite working. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  8th place </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d40/43c/7a7/d4043c7a7ecbe36f5cf616e8049a8ca2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://potratim.ru/">potratim.ru</a> <br>  Potratim.Ru is a news feed in which messages are published about new interesting products, promotions and discounts on already being sold, and tips on how to sell what you have already managed to buy.  A sort of product Habr, UGC a paradise for the consumer.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project is very interesting, and can be very useful for many people. <br><br>  <b>astroverse (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúI have long wanted to have a subscription to some tape, where all the interesting new items are published as they appear in the Russian retail, so as not to break my head every time to buy such interesting things, not to wander aimlessly between the shelves of shopping centers , and do not rage in search of the dates of appearance on sale of things that interest me.</i>  <i>I waited, I believed, I hoped, but in the end I came to the trivial conclusion that everything in this life I have to do myself. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  7th place </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/72f/409/7a8/72f4097a82dca63d85587483e21345b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://turbojob.ru/">turbojob.ru</a> <br>  TurboJob decided to bring the job search market on the Internet to the rails of Web 2.0 and simplify everything to the maximum.  In order to place your vacancy you do not have to fill a huge form, it is enough to indicate the scope, profession and skills in the form of a message.  The design is also designed in the spirit of minimalism, so that nothing distracts from the essence - from searching for work and performers. <br><br>  <b>Developers:</b> <i>‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt offer applicants to fill out sophisticated forms just to make CVs in unscrupulous hands.</i>  <i>To find a job you just need to respond to the vacancies of interest.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>We do not charge employers and personnel agencies for the posting of vacancies and do not try to force them to perform non-binding procedures just to be heard. ‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br><h4>  6th place </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7b/464/d66/f7b464d66ca6e8f505cef2d85cd5aacc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://singenglish.ru/">singenglish.ru</a> <br>  SingEnglish.Ru is a project of original and fun learning English through listening to songs.  You listen to the song in small pieces, and after listening to each piece, you must enter the words that you heard there.  If the word can not be disassembled, then you can ask for a word, but you will only have 15 such tips for the song. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Konyshev (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúFirst of all, this is audio perception training.</i>  <i>The listening comprehension of English is traditionally one of the most difficult places to learn English.</i>  <i>This skill can only be acquired through constant training.</i>  <i>The Sing-English method makes workouts somewhat more engaging and much more accessible than classes with a tutor. Secondly, vocabulary.</i>  <i>When replenishing vocabulary, it is important that words and the context of their use remain in memory for a long time.</i>  <i>The words of your favorite song remain in your memory forever.</i>  <i>In fact, you will always remember every word you guess. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  5th place </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba6/bc6/6df/ba6bc66df25ad3c473aaf9407adb4391.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.genway.ru/">www.genway.ru</a> <br>  The launch of this project is timed to the end of the year of the family.  He invites his users to restore family values, and create their own family tree, bringing together all their relatives and pointing out the links between them.  The authors expect that the project will become a real archive of family annals. <br><br>  <b>From the press release:</b> <i>‚ÄúBy registering on GenWay, a user can build an online family tree, form a textual database of facts from the lives of relatives, keep a calendar of family events and save multimedia information (photo, video, audio, personal creativity).</i>  <i>We note that the portal has agreements with the International Genealogical Agency and will provide additional opportunities: conducting classical genealogical research, developing coat of arms, family diplomas and albums, making family tableware. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  4th place </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f56/4c6/59a/f564c659a95c0a4eee0f98d1c7843621.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://wifi4free.ru/">wifi4free.ru</a> <br>  A project that allows you to find out where in your city there are Wi-Fi access points, are they free, what is their signal level and speed.  The system itself determines your location and shows you the maps for the city in which you are currently located. <br><br>  <b>Pavel Markovnin (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúOf course, similar services already exist (for example, Yandex and Mail), but all of them, in my opinion, are inconvenient and, moreover, exist only as part of a large service.</i>  <i>From my point of view, the simplest thing is to look for points on the map.</i>  <i>This is the most obvious and easy way. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  3rd place </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ad/d15/fc2/0add15fc29972336d119e44d85f1eb87.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.priglasite.ru/">www.priglasite.ru</a> <br>  Invite.Ru is a platform for organizing mass meetings.  Project services allow you to make a beautiful invitation, and send it to the necessary people, besides it is possible to arrange a vote for the choice of meeting place, meeting time.  Dana tools for the formation of a community around a specific meeting - you can create topics, discuss the nuances of the meeting, post photos after the meeting (perhaps you should take note of the organizers of meetings of startups?) <br><br>  <b>Julia Krylova: (Developer):</b> <i>‚ÄúYou can explore all the features of the site in a few minutes with one click on the link‚Äú Site Tour ‚Äù, which is located on the main page in the upper left corner.</i>  <i>You will see a screen with screenshots of the entire site, viewing that you should have no doubt about how the site is arranged and what you can do on it.</i>  <i>You can also see an example of one of the invitations in the form in which your guests will see it. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  2nd place </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b7/5b6/795/9b75b679527f61f3b036b1d1d227ac14.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://darudar.org/">darudar.org</a> <br>  A gift-dar is a community of donating to each other various personal assets ‚Äî things, opportunities, time, etc.  The project has already donated a new mp3 player, and the project itself and its founder managed to light up in the Playbill and at Mayak. <br><br>  <b>Maxim Karakulov (Founder):</b> <i>‚ÄúSuddenly it became obvious that with the help of the Internet you can create all the necessary conditions so that people could give each other their belongings - absolutely free of charge and free of charge - as it was possible before only in a circle of very close people.</i>  <i>And it became possible to involve the whole world in this process!</i>  <i>An idea that had previously seemed utopian suddenly became absolutely non-operative and tangible. ‚Äù</i> <br><br><h4>  1 place </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bd4/984/007/bd49840076364d7660f5f6c7585ea11b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://infox.ru/">infox.ru</a> <br>  Infox.ru is news 2.0.  First, the usual for news feeds, text content is diluted with video content.  Secondly, the portal is planned to include reporters in real time.  The project is counting on reverse switching with readers, and believes that they will be able to make news themselves, and influence the status quo.  It seems very convenient to search for news on the tag cloud. <br><br>  <b>Irina Subbotina (PR-manager):</b> <i>‚ÄúIn fact, we are taking a step forward from news broadcasting on the Internet, towards converting with video and television technologies.</i>  <i>We believe that this is the future, this is confirmed by the latest trends that occur in the market.</i>  <i>Windows, along with Yahoo, are developing special chipsets that will make interactive television.</i>  <i>The farther away, the more popular the broadband channels will be, the more there will be video information on the network, incl.</i>  <i>video of various, personalized, interactive, giving information in real time "</i> <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/40914/">Top Startups September</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/37998/">Top Startup Augusta</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/43505/">https://habr.com/ru/post/43505/</a></p>
