Although it is a usual, in essence, dock, which is complete, but it is made so qualitatively and with a love of detail that I decided to write a short review of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/faa/e68/619/faae6861911b35c8da52028d2c3613bd.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Briefly about the device: this is a dock for the fourth or fifth iPhone (two versions are sold, but the first one can be upgraded) from a single piece of aluminum that was invented by Casey Hopkins.  To start production, he posted <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hop/elevation-dock-the-best-dock-for-iphone">his project</a> on Kickstarter and was able to collect almost half a million dollars, although he asked for "only" 75 thousand.  More than 12 thousand people financed the Casey initiative. <br><br>  Here is the presentation video of the gadget to better present it: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xg9xgSLfz2A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi6sU9BvoYwLUCHslZcL5qavhaiqA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Now on the <a href="http://elevationlab.com/">corporate website of the</a> company Casey Elevation Lab, the dock that has already been launched into production can be purchased for $ 89 plus shipping, which in my case came out at another $ 50. <br><br>  After I picked up a small cardboard box of US mail in the form of a cube, I could get the device from there in a fairly simple but pleasant branded box (I apologize in advance for the photo, I did what was at hand) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab6/727/e52/ab6727e525fe587fbf9a679fe6d2dd3b.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5fd/52c/230/5fd52c230edef816720bf307636324fb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/01c/3b3/124/01c3b312452ec2e2ef5e2a7aef9d46e6.jpg"><br><br>  Next, peel off the round Velcro at the edges, pull out the dock on the cardboard platform <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/384/408/189/384408189976b310ecdabb1324147eb1.jpg"><br><br>  Turn off the bottom of the wooden (!) Area <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/970/437/3fc/9704373fce492e209317f780187e6ef1.jpg"><br><br>  Done, you can use.  I have an unpainted silver version, but there are other colors, such as matte black.  The connection is stable, without surprises, there is nothing special to describe here, and this, I suspect, is good :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/927/673/22b/92767322b3f4d1a865ebeb5f08ac9fb8.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, how dock looks from below.  Podstavochki rubber here, one of them squeezed out the name of the company.  Bolts can be easily unscrewed by replacing the wire (standard microUSB into the device and a simple USB into a computer or a power outlet) with a longer one, which also comes bundled (nicely): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7bd/fda/440/7bdfda440d51c75e8818029550a35a92.jpg"><br><br>  The main feature of the device is the weight, the dock pulls almost 600 grams, because it is made of a massive solid piece of aluminum.  In addition to the feeling of that very quality, it still gives a very important feature - when I take out the phone, the dock remains almost motionless on the table.  This feature is actively demonstrated in commercials, and I must say that this is true.  He, of course, is still a little off the table, but I‚Äôm writing off the fact that I insert the phone in a plastic case, and that the back gum of the support makes it tighter.  Without a cover, the stroke is looser and there is no tearing away.  By the way, this gum can even be removed and inserted into the phone in any, even very thick case. <br><br>  In general, the impressions of the device for a couple of days I have been pleasant.  Indeed, it is felt that it is of small-scale production and is made qualitatively.  I do not presume to say that manually, but close to it. <br><br>  I have an iPhone 4S, so I ordered a version with a 30-pin connector, but in order not to lose the dock when upgrading, when the time comes, I additionally ordered an adapter that will allow you to use iPhones with the new Lighting connector.  This thing costs $ 15 and looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a8/212/f41/5a8212f415036b2c8ff41e4dbbc121b2.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the adapter itself, a pair of hexagons and screws are included.  The essence of the upgrade will be that you need to pull out a standard microcircuit with a 30-pin connector and replace it with an adapter into which you insert a regular Apple cord with Lightning.  Yes, the wire will have to be tied to the dock, but it pleases the inexpensive upgrade option thought out by the manufacturer. <br><br>  In general, this is all, I will be glad to answer questions.  I can recommend a thing for purchase to anyone who does not mind 3-4 thousand rubles for, in general, the usual thing, without which you can easily do, but neatly and efficiently done, with the same human touch, which gives a little more everyday comfort. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167111/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167111/</a></p>
