  <section class="page js-page"><h1>English wikipedia attacks?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Greetings to everyone again <br><br>  My plans were not to write a post on Habr until a new information on the development of qutIM appears (by the way, we moved to <a href="http://gitorious.org/qutim">gitorious.org</a> , I hope now the development will be more open, and it will be easier for third-party developers to help the project).  But in this situation, I need help from the community.  Circumstances <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Deletion_sorting/Software">in the English part of Wikipedia</a> forced me to pick up a pen.  Let's start with the background ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started a week ago, when administrators and the incomprehensible Zorro with the nickname Miami33139 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/QutIM_(2nd_nomination)">suddenly deleted</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/qutIM">an article</a> for a completely inadequate reason: ‚Äúthe name means something in some Latin / Arabic language, the software product is insignificant‚Äù.  Until now, I thought that Wikipedia is a public encyclopedia, which is done by the <b>people for the people</b> , but it seems I, like many, were mistaken.

          data-ad-layout="in-article"

      The week had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Ged_UK">to convince</a> the Wikipedia administrator <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Ged_UK">GedUk</a> that he had done something not entirely logical.  And he was not convinced even by the links to the sites <a href="http://library.forum.nokia.com/index.jsp%3Ftopic%3D/Qt_for_Symbian_Developers_Library/GUID-3FBDA59B-2D43-4D6C-AF96-4313F15DE371.html">nokia.com</a> and <a href="http://qt-apps.org/index.php%3Fxsortmode%3Dhigh">Qt-Apps.org</a> with a clear explanation of the reasons for their objectivity.  When all the same managed to convince him, he restored the article in the same volume, but put it <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php%3Ftitle%3DWikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/QutIM_%25283rd_nomination%2529">on deletion</a> , explaining that the need to check references by the community. <br><br>  Well put, put so, I was already sure that we were going, because they found more than a dozen convincing sources confirming the <b>significance of the</b> program: the number of downloads of the program on the first day after the release, links to blogs of people, articles devoted to qutIM.  He pointed out that Nokia had ported the application to Symbian, and that qutIM is the leader in Qt-Apps.org rating, but they are not convinced by administrators, for all of them for one reason or another - non-authoritative sources of information about the importance of the product.  This is where the most interesting thing began, crawling over the links, stumbled upon a vote about removing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Quiet_Internet_Pager_%25282nd_nomination%2529">QIP</a> 'a, as a <b>minor</b> program.  If this were limited, it could be decided that this is another round of war against unofficial ICQ clients (it‚Äôs not a secret that the majority of QIP and qutIM users are ICQ users), but events developed ... Soon, they were sent for deletion : <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Gajim">Gajim</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Jabbin">Jabbin</a> </li></ul><br>  For all clients, the reason is the same ‚Äúnot-notable software‚Äù and absolutely all sources cited by the community were denied with the words ‚Äúnot reliable source‚Äù. <br><br>  Under threat are also: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psi_(instant_messaging_client)">Psi</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_IM">Miranda</a> </li></ul><br>  because  On their pages there were the same messages about the need to find references to sources that Gajim had previously. <br><br>  I have no idea how to deal with such aggression against IM clients, as a developer of qutIM, I personally hurt the problem, so I ask for help from the habr-community.  It is necessary to support customers on Wikipedia, to find ways to make this strange attack crash.  If there are other ways to deal with this problem, suggest in the comments, we will try. <br><br>  Upd.
