But, as usual, illustrated. <br><br>  So, the <b>Remington typewriter</b> : not the earliest of similar mechanisms, but the first, whose industrial production was established and put on a grand scale.  In this connection, straightforward, like a nail, Americans consider its inventor Christopher Scholes to be the ancestor of all typewriters in general. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Work on the invention began in 1867, at the initiative of the publisher and public figure <b>Christopher Scholes</b> , joined by <b>Carlos Gliden</b> and <b>Samuel Soul</b> .  Later, <b>James Densmore</b> entered the group as an investor.

It was invented, embodied in metal and patented several samples, initially unsatisfactory. <br>  Patents from 1868: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f89/fd3/4a9/f89fd34a9725d1809bd579c790c272ba.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It looked like the early versions of the Scholes-Glidean-Soul typewriter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d09/17e/57d/d0917e57d1e209bdf8463e555959f4cd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Only by 1873 was it possible to create something acceptable. <br>  In a photograph taken in 1872, Scholes‚Äôs daughter is testing her father‚Äôs experimental machine.  Next to it, on another image, it is the same (apparently, it is drawn from the photo). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/604/270/2d2/6042702d277a5ccac6dd30cdccd3ed42.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Subsequently, the size of the machine was reduced. <br>  Model Scholes and Glidden from 1873: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6fa/217/309/6fa21730945b94873c774a771f29e1f9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But most importantly, the inventors managed to find a real investor - <b>Remington &amp; Sons,</b> which produced weapons and agricultural equipment. <br>  <b>Phil Remington</b> , one of the Remington brothers, the head of the company at the time: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e3/9dc/e53/3e39dce53c000198b117b46788007ab3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Remington &amp; Sons turned out to be the horse that transported the invention to a wide strategic space: with the direct assistance of Remington, under its brand and at its weapons production facilities, the world's first mass production of typewriters was established. <br>  It looked like "Remington" number 1: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4a3/4fc/17a/4a34fc17a7e0b370aa51691b109dbaa7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  (The footswitch touches, of course. The poured Singer sewing machine that my great-grandmother had). <br><br>  Typewriter manufacturing at the Remington Factory: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af0/afc/267/af0afc26795c75406cc2515a4b03b855.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Testing and adjustment of manufactured machines: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/978/dcf/aa5/978dcfaa5883c25832c08581460b1ee5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since 1874 sales began. <br>  Shop, in which was sold typewriter "Remington": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39d/550/df5/39d550df5df2317d0fbed5cb86fa601f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the first advertisements of the Remington typewriter: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/364/ee3/8fa/364ee38facec5e0fd5f619497408f6ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Drawings from the first catalog of typewriters: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/52f/a0c/1fa/52fa0c1fafcbea327217eb5de4461e41.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the same time continued to improve the design.  Instead of retiring Samuel Sole, <b>Matthias Schwalbach</b> took part in the work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e7/eb1/880/1e7eb1880282f69ad984557ec521de22.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Patents from 1876 and 1878: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/58d/c69/ef2/58dc69ef2d96268d76f8b27d2172d5dc.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Successful finds were immediately embodied in the design: the typewriter was improved. <br>  The range of typewriters "Remington": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4d/a35/fac/a4da35faca3fb7af7a0feaa57ea8e9c4.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ba/d93/f35/2bad93f351f0c37c59727cd3638903ac.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b74/a38/a1c/b74a38a1c2f7fc0e2ddac2778986d7e6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In 1886, the Remington brothers experienced financial difficulties and were forced to sell the business: the rights to the invention were transferred to a specially created <b>Remington Typewriter Company</b> . <br><br>  Nothing has changed: the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe necessity and convenience of using printing equipment was by then firmly introduced into the mass consciousness, the Remington trademark remained the catalyst in this process. <br><br>  Continued persistent and well-designed advertising. <br>  ‚ÄúTo me, please, the Remington typewriter.‚Äù  This is the best typewriter, isn't it? ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01c/b1f/a17/01cb1fa17d987161232f35627c97b7f3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In old photos, I often see familiar faces, and this one too.  In the image of the buyer - Nikita Mikhalkov, if you do not know.  What once again proves the unmatched quality of ‚ÄúRemington‚Äù: Nikita Sergeyevich will not acquire poor-quality crap under any circumstances, as you understand. <br><br>  Other advertising. <br>  ‚ÄúOh, how I love my Remington typewriter!  We have to constantly look around to check if it is in place. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cd9/3dc/862/cd93dc862b14e07584808ee5fe31dcf7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The advanced advertising technologies of that time were used, namely, the identification of the brand with a pretty face. <br>  Beautiful young lady in the photos - Miss "Remington": <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ca/f12/97a/0caf1297a1a82424954c64525071a138.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/985/c72/670/985c72670035d1d19162c767d4039867.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38a/c34/858/38ac348580eca0d87b2c65f5cf43ff42.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Massive advertising lasted for half a century: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b97/85a/c82/b9785ac8229c6b641d933b486e7e28ed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Even office furniture specially designed specifically for the Remington typewriters was produced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f04/8e5/a3e/f048e5a3e3a291f8e509a340f51c4a08.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54b/2d4/bf9/54b2d4bf93a1a103840bd297a8df41d0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The glorious technological history did not end immediately, but somehow by chance, gradually. <br>  In 1927, Remington Typewriter Company merged with <b>Remington Rand</b> , a computer equipment manufacturer.  This is not surprising: already at that time, Remington accounting machines were produced on the basis of typewriters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8a/b9d/643/b8ab9d6438041792e684d5246fb3dfa3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Printing mechanisms, although they were used for decades, began to be perceived as peripherals to computing devices: the era of printers was coming, which demanded new heroes-inventors, heroes-investors and heroes-producers. <br><br>  What is left of Remington?  A lot, if you think about it. <br>  The Remington brothers earned a lot of money from the invention (it‚Äôs amazing how they managed to go bankrupt).  Christopher Scholes didn‚Äôt stay, too, having received worldwide recognition in addition to the despicable metal. <br>  In this collage of Scholes, as far as I understand, in paradise, and in the role of the Gurias are the beneficent typists who the inventor provided with dust-free and well-paid work: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/801/f01/a67/801f01a678f54c10b89c0e6be23af578.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On earth, grateful users erected a monument to the inventor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd2/758/2b4/dd27582b4a97b8f1e1f5aca985e16cef.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Among the first users of "Remington" were, by the way, famous personalities, in particular <b>Mark Twain</b> . <br>  Russians, of course, are much closer to another, much more powerful last name. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62c/939/93a/62c93993ae609f4fb1abc8fb95c66d85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Yes, <b>Lev Nikolaevich Tolstoy</b> himself, and behind the personal Tolstoyan "Remington" - his daughter. <br><br>  As you see, the invention of Christopher Scholes has had the most beneficial and moral influence that you can imagine on Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195540/</a></p>
