      Representatives of the right holder assessed the damage from the activities of the studio as ‚Äúespecially large‚Äù.  According to the text of the article, in this case, for illegal voice acting and distribution of serials, violators are threatened with forced labor for up to five years or imprisonment for up to six years with a fine of up to 500 thousand rubles. <br><br>  The amateur studio "Cube in the Cube" faced a real prospect with all of its small staff going to prison. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The studio used to offer Amedia TV voice acting.  But the Russian copyright owner considered the quality of voice acting to be not high enough for his level.  Although back in 2012, Amedia TV tentatively agreed with the Cube Cuba studio about the localization of TV shows, but when she learned that only two people work in the studio, she refused to cooperate, explaining that they needed a premium voice acting for 12 votes.  Although in the <a href="https://vk.com/wall-11969798_231160">comments</a> in the Cube in a Cube group, users mostly express a different opinion: they believe that the official voice of the same Silicon Valley is significantly inferior to the amateur voice of the Cube in Cube studio. <br><br>  In fact, the same thing happened now.  "Cubes in Cuba" again offered their services in voice acting, but the copyright holder refused.  ‚ÄúAmedia refused to work with us,‚Äù the <a href="https://vk.com/%40kubik3-amedia-otkazalas-s-nami-rabotat">message was</a> published yesterday in the official Cube Cuba group. <br><br>  The motivation for the refusal is the doubts about the sincerity of the Cube Cuba studio: ‚ÄúIn your Telegraph channel, you continue to spread the TV series voiced by your studio, the rights to which belong to A Serial LLC, which, given the situation, is unacceptable behavior and brings doubts your sincerity and decency, ‚Äùsaid Amedia TV representatives. <br><br>  Thus, from this point on, Cubic Cuba‚Äôs studio ceases to voice HBO serials, the rights to which are owned by Amedia TV.  This applies to the following series: <br><br><ul><li>  Silicon Valley, </li><li>  "Billions", </li><li>  "Ash against the sinister dead" </li><li>  "American Horror Story", </li><li>  "Two", </li><li>  "World of the Wild West" </li><li>  other... </li></ul><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sad that Amedia didn‚Äôt pay attention to the opinion of those who watch TV shows in an alternative voice acting.  It's a shame that we have to give up a dozen of our favorite TV shows, which we did well.  It's a pity that the NWO does not know that the company to which they sold the rights localizes their Silicon Valley so that no one wants to watch it, ‚Äùwrote the guys from the studio‚Äú Cube Cuba ‚Äù. <br><br>  The saddest thing is that ‚ÄúAmedia TV‚Äù still has grounds to state the ‚Äúmajor damage‚Äù inflicted and initiate a criminal case: ‚ÄúWe still do not know whether Amedia will sue us.  Nonetheless, we want to complete this story with minimal legal risks and for this we will offer Amedia to make a settlement agreement, the official ‚ÄúCubic Cube‚Äù blog says.  - Attorney Alisa Obraztsova, an expert in the field of intellectual property, will deal with negotiations with Amedia and our defense.  She has extensive experience in the field of media, and most importantly - she sees people in us, not ‚Äútwo individuals‚Äù. ‚Äù <br><br>  Studio "Cube in Cuba" thanks its viewers for their support: "Thousands of viewers wrote comments and made posts that they want to watch our voice acting legally and are willing to pay money for it."  But this is impossible in the current circumstances of the exclusive contract "Amedia" with HBO. <br><br>  HBO itself is also very jealous of the protection of its intellectual property.  For example, the HBO trademark for the phrase ‚ÄúWinter is coming‚Äù (Winter is coming) <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/283570/">applies to clothing, dishes, hats, bags, mouse pads and other souvenirs</a> .  You cannot write these words on any product without risking getting sued by HBO. <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Note:</b> When commenting on this material, please follow the rules of Geektimes.
