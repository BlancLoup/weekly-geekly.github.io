  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Motorola Atrix HD: a rare smartphone for fans of junk and not only</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I have long been a fan of the products of the American company Motorola and, until recently, enjoyed using the Motorola Atrix 2 smartphone. It is clear that I could not ignore such an event as the purchase of a Motorola Atrix HD device by my friend.  I will not hide, I played a significant role in choosing a model, for which I received thanks from the happy owner.  Now I want to introduce you to this rare CIS smartphone.  Interesting?  I ask under the cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0cd/ad2/0e0/0cdad20e02ec7b3f997ae568a1780d42.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, Motorola has noticeably lost ground in recent years, and it has left many markets.  Nevertheless, it continues to surprise users with the unusual and attractive design of its devices.  By the way, is everyone already in the know about the recently introduced three models - Mini, Ultra and MAXX?  While the smartphone market is teeming with faceless models encased in black plastic cases of the same type, Motorola uses unusual and practical materials in its devices.  Recall even the back panel Atrix 2, made of flexible wear-resistant plastic, or the back side of the RAZR XT910 of Kevlar (it is also the main material of the body of the new models).  But we are talking about something else.

      Motorola Atrix 2 and Motorola RAZR XT910, I remembered for a reason.  It seems to me that Atrix HD borrowed its design from them.  In front, this smartphone is similar to its predecessor (Atrix 2), while the back side resembles the RAZR XT910 in a light version.  That is, the corners of the hull are rounded, not as aggressive as those of the "razor". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cdc/ec6/033/cdcec6033f91f36a8590f97f96a73094.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/faa/f42/d57/faaf42d578348a6f4d458dd31d7bf266.jpg"><br><br>  Motorola Atrix HD, unlike Atrix 2, does not have touch-sensitive control keys - they are transferred to the screen, only the round AT &amp; T operator logo flaunts at the bottom. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1a8/8e5/746/1a88e57460ed02885bee6758ab15cba0.jpg"><br><br>  The screen also protects the scratch-resistant glass Gorilla Glass.  Above the display is a small slot of the speaker, covered with a mesh, the lens of a 1.3-megapixel front camera and proximity / illumination sensors.  In general, everything is standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e06/d8f/4db/e06d8f4db8fca9df340c95926a1a403a.jpg"><br><br>  Almost the entire back of the Motorola Atrix HD is made of Kevlar (as is the case with the RAZR XT910).  In the center is the company logo, and on top - a thickening, which is located 8-megapixel camera, flash and speaker. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a95/577/e2b/a95577e2ba8606353629b3e32d0570a6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1c6/319/f6d/1c6319f6df33961a51ddef451cbe4a3c.jpg"><br><br>  The lock / unlock key is grooved, it is located in the upper part of the right side of the device, and below it is the volume rocker.  The buttons have a clear move, they slightly protrude from the body, making it easy to grope. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/844/2f2/630/8442f2630600e9368c335511fe7ee225.jpg"><br><br>  At the bottom of the left side there are two compartments: one for the SIM card and the second for the MicroSD memory card.  Both compartments are hidden behind the folding "door", also inherited from the Motorola RAZR XT910. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/07b/a8a/c11/07ba8ac115a31663e4b1139f30350b47.jpg"><br><br>  At the top of the Motorola Atrix HD there are three connectors, namely: the standard 3.5 mm headphone jack, microUSB and HDMI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed9/3ec/ee7/ed93ecee75b5382c6ff1c84573caecb3.jpg"><br><br>  The build quality is not worth talking about, Motorola has never had any problems with this.  Atrix HD in the hand lies confidently, it weighs 140 g, and its dimensions are 134 x 70 x 8.4 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6df/679/593/6df6795938225b4a7b2b2672073337d1.jpg"><br><br>  In general, Atrix HD belongs to the category of very compact smartphones - yes, today a 4.5-inch diagonal already makes it necessary to call the device by this very word.  Compare the Motorola Atrix HD with a 5.3-inch Highscreen Omega Prime XL: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/15c/e24/7a7/15ce247a7cfb6347254813f4f985d521.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cb5/4dd/93e/cb54dd93e3e0a6cf51e1a370234f7acb.jpg"><br><br>  The same RAZR has approximately the same size and slightly smaller weight (131 x 69 x 7.1 mm, 127 g), however, I personally do not like the way it lies in my hand.  Probably, it's all about the sharp corners of the RAZR. <br><br>  Screen Motorola Atrix HD can be safely called one of the strengths of the smartphone.  The device uses a 4.5-inch TFT-matrix with HD-resolution (1280 x 720 pixels), as for the notorious number of ppi, it is equal to 326. In general, the pixels are barely noticeable even on closer inspection.  You must admit that this is also quite good by today's standards, let alone the time when this model went on sale (summer 2012) - it was one of the best displays on the market.  Also worth mentioning is the ColorBoost technology implemented here, which makes colors more vivid and saturated. <br><br>  The ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the Motorola Atrix HD is the dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon S4 Plus MSM8960 processor, which operates at 1.5 GHz, while the ‚ÄúRAM‚Äù is 1 GB.  As for the graphics accelerator, the Adreno 225 is used here. It is clear that today it is not the most productive hardware platform, however, the smartphone works quite quickly, and you can play modern toys without problems.  For fans of "synthetics" I offer the results of the test AnTuTu. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f2/f1d/1a0/9f2f1d1a0a1b0202c39e81d8e55b726d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b11/77b/a04/b1177ba04545e50d259e3dfb3677ea6e.png"><br><br>  The built-in memory of the device is 8 GB, plus there is the possibility of expanding it with microSD memory cards.  Initially, Motorola Atrix HD was sold with the Android 4.0 operating system, but later it was updated to version 4.1.  Whether the smartphone will receive updates in the future is not yet clear; the American company in this regard is quite mysterious.  It is worth remembering the situation with Atrix 2, which was running Android 2.3.  Then on the Motorola website there was information that the gadget will receive the firmware with the fourth robot in the third quarter of 2012, and when all the deadlines came out, the rumors subsided.  It became clear that "the guys from Illinois" all thrown, but it was not there - suddenly a new firmware with ICS was released.  Therefore, it makes no sense to predict anything about updating the Motorola Atrix HD, it will be as it will be. <br><br>  We add that Android is not completely "naked", it is slightly modified.  For example, the ‚ÄúFavorites‚Äù item has been added to the menu where you can add the most frequently used applications.  In principle, quite convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ff9/656/bef/ff9656befc87daa38d2e62ba94895860.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e38/5dd/f85/e385ddf859a41d298bdb0695b6099fab.png"><br><br>  There is also a corporate widget called "Circles", by the way, quite comfortable and "simpatishny".  It consists of three adjoining circles of different diameters.  The rightmost and smallest of them shows the limit of used Internet traffic or the battery charge as a percentage.  The average lap displays the weather, and the left shows the date and time, and you can select a digital or analog clock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dbf/f3c/ec9/dbff3cec9ae9bc1622d1f789a65db1b1.png"><br><br>  Another nice addition from Motorola is the Smart Actions program, designed to automate the launch of various applications depending on the time of day, location or battery charge.  The program already has several templates, but you can also customize everything yourself.  For example, when the battery level is low, the gadget will automatically lower the screen brightness, turn off the wireless modules and so on.  Or they called you, but you did not hear the calls - the device will automatically raise the volume of the call.  In general, there are a lot of settings and many of them are really useful. <br><br>  A set of wireless modules for Motorola Atrix HD is fairly standard - it is Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi (802.11a / b / g / n) and GPS.  There is support for LTE.  Like the Motorola RAZR XT910, the battery here is not removable, it has a capacity of 1,780 mAh.  What can I say, with active use, the device lives quietly on one charge from morning to late evening.  On the average, the mode of use increases to two days. <br>  Above, I have already said that the main camera Motorola Atrix HD has a resolution of 8 megapixels.  In terms of the quality of the photographs, it is quite comparable with the cameras of the same Atrix 2 and RAZR - a good 8-megapixel camera, not outstanding (like some Samsung Galaxy SIII), but it also does not grab the rear.  Here are examples of photos taken by Motorola Atrix HD: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e47/3cd/37b/e473cd37ba2a2c46862b2f7241a9eb38.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d79/913/93b/d7991393bbb37f8885bcd34f92f25f2d.jpg"><br><br>  Let's sum up.  Of course, today the characteristics of the Motorola Atrix HD are far from the top-end smartphones (especially in the light of the new models presented), however, we should not forget about the age of this model, at the time of release it was quite an interesting device.  Plus, an unusual bold design - this is not the faceless "bricks" that filled the store shelves.  In what, but in the design and materials of the hull "guys from Illinois" know a lot about it.  In other words, if you want a smartphone "not like everyone else", and besides, reliable and productive - you can look at the Motorola Atrix HD. <br><br>  PS Let the American company leave almost all markets (except for the USA, Canada and either Germany or Britain - but these are old models. The new ones will be only in the USA and Canada, for Verizon. And as for the upcoming Moto X, nothing is known yet. Theoretically, it will be sold everywhere, because it is directly related to Google, but who knows), and besides, it was not particularly active, soon, namely in August of this year, Motorola will present the sensational Moto X, the brainchild of Google and Motorola.  According to rumors, this gadget will be the first smartphone in the world, whose design the user can customize before buying.  But that's another story. <br><br>  Well, we look forward to the new masterpieces from Motorola and we hope that it will still regain some of its former greatness. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187928/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187928/</a></p>
