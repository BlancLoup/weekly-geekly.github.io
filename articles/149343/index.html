An open source cloud platform is simply a godsend for IT vendors and some large end users who need an open cloud ecosystem.  But despite all this, many criticize OpenStack.  Some question its management model, others its technical maturity compared to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> and <a href="http://www.vmware.com/ru/">VMware</a> .  In this article we will try to uncover the essence of the contradictions concerning OpenStack and make our verdict. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Why not love</b> <br><br>  The project spends a huge amount of resources to deal with critical loads.  Initially, the founder of Rackspace managed OpenStack and <a href="http://gigaom.com/cloud/lew-moorman-talks-anso-labs-openstack-and-cloud-revenue/">complained</a> that outside influence on the project was too great.  After that, the company created an independent structure of the OpenStack Foundation, but the management drama continues anyway.  While in the process of electing a new board of directors, the OpenStack Foundation was forced to investigate the allegation that an employee, along with one of his subordinates, tried to intimidate one of the nominated candidates. <br><br>  There are also concerns that there are too many cooks in the OpenStack kitchen.  As a result, development and development are slow, and all this can end up just like Unix.  Geoff Arnold, a distribution systems expert who studied OpenStack while working at Yahoo, said that OpenStack will never be as stable as AWS because he has to work with nearly 200 distribution companies: ‚ÄúI think Amazon has one advantage over open source projects: the company is managed by one person, and that is Jeff Bezos. ‚Äù

      Citrix, one of the first members of OpenStack, recently cut its costs and links to the project, instead deciding to install CloudStack on its platform.  Samir Dolakia (Sameer Dholakia) said: "We were going to build on the basis of OpenStack ... but then we realized that we simply could not wait a year or two before technical maturation." <br><br>  It is possible that other members of OpenStack, such as HP, IBM and Red Hat, or one of the startups like <a href="http://gigaom.com/cloud/ex-nasa-cto-builds-cloud-dream-team-launches-nebula/">Nebula</a> and <a href="http://gigaom.com/cloud/piston-pitches-openstack-cloudfoundry-integration/">Piston Cloud</a> , will decide that the project is moving slowly or in the wrong direction, and will exit it. <br><br>  <b>Why love</b> <br><br>  However, despite everything, Rackspace, HP, Dell, Internap, AT &amp; T, Deutsche Telekom and Dreamhost are building or have already built public clouds based on OpenStack.  Also members of OpenStack are Intel, Cisco, NetApp and VMware.  The fact that many influential companies have signed up for the project gives reason to think that it will have both development resources and customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0d5/a8f/08d/0d5a8f08d429cd07ea8221892b37230d.jpg"><br><br>  Rackspace alone can give potential patrons a reason for confidence.  The company's cloud business, which is now based on OpenStack, brings in about $ 1.3 billion a year, and that figure will grow in the next few years, according to CEO Lanam Napier.  Recently, Rackspace staged a small rebranding: they removed the word ‚Äúhosting‚Äù of the logo and added ‚ÄúThe cloud-based open source company‚Äù. <br><br>  Want big customers?  How about eBay, which has just opened its private OpenStack cloud along with Intel, Yahoo, NASA, and many major research centers.  Most likely, there are other major OpenStack customers who have not yet told the public about it. <br><br>  Perhaps it is in the order of things that a project causing such a stir and providing such opportunities becomes a hotbed of struggle and scandals.  But companies involved in OpenStack will most likely be able to keep it on the right track. <br><br>  And what is your attitude to OpenStack? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149343/</a></p>
