  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Aircraft modeling - the beginning of a long journey</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In connection with the upcoming day of cosmonautics and aviation, I decided to raise a topic that already flashed on Habr√©, and judging by the comments from people it was interesting, but for some reason it did not receive much development. <br>  Big aviation, and even more so cosmonautics, is not available to everyone, but aeromodelling is a hobby that everyone can feel like an aviator. <br>  I myself am new to aeromodelling and comments from more experienced pilots are welcome. <br>  This is my first note on this topic and I would like to tell you in it about how my journey began in aeromodelling, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/popular_science/90682/">continued here.</a>  . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, last spring, wandering through the expanses of the Internet, I accidentally stumbled upon a modeling forum.  And since I dreamed of flying from the country, but I couldn‚Äôt because of poor health, my model aircraft became my hobby - I bought such plastic kits for gluing and glued.  And then I came across flying models of aircraft.  And of course, immediately get tired of such a purchase.  <strong>I warn you right away that aircraft modeling is quite a costly occupation, for a normal start it is desirable to have initial capital of about 20-30 tr.</strong>  True, it is not necessary to have it right away, in my case the purchase of all the necessary things took about three months to complete, which is quite riseable. <br><br><h2>  What do we need to start flying? </h2><br>  No matter how cool and experienced pilot "Il-2 attack aircraft" you did not feel, or maybe even you flew at the helm of a real aircraft, in any case, the first thing you need to start flying is a simulator. <br>  Without a good simulator, the start of flights is impossible.  Many people stumbled on this, not one modelka died in the hands of even experienced pilots who flew in the ‚Äúbig‚Äù aircraft and took up the console without training in the simulator. <br>  Simulators are not Microsoft Flight Simulator, and not IL-2 attack aircraft.  There are special simulators of radio-controlled model aircraft.  I will highlight three main ones: <br>  FMS - a free simulator with a minimal set of functions. <br>  AeroFly - a paid simulator with good graphics and physics, a large number of models and flight platforms <br>  RealFlight is also paid, also beautiful and of high quality. <br>  I opted for AeroFly Pro Delux.  Simulators are sold with laces for connecting equipment or even with their own consoles, but it is better to take habituation equipment with the simulator right away.

    <h2>  Selection of control equipment </h2><br>  The control equipment for radio models is produced by several large firms: Hitec, Futaba, JR, Spectrum. <br>  And several Chinese firms, such as wfly, but my IMHO is better to take the equipment of a more or less well-known company.  Although wfly works great too, in principle. <br>  Control equipment is classified by frequency (main - 35 MHz, 40 MHz and 2.4 GHz) and by the number of channels (3,4,6,7,9,10, etc.) <br>  FM frequencies of 35 MHz and 40 MHz are classics, they have been flying for more than a decade.  2.4 GHz is a relatively new development, but has already gained immense popularity among modellers.  The main difference between Fm frequencies and 2.4 GHz is that when flying to the FM frequency, you always need to know what channel you have (for example, I have 51 channels, 40.675 MHz) and make sure that your frequency does not intersect with anyone on the airfield - otherwise, get two sets of "firewood" while flying at the same frequency.  At 2.4 GHz there are no such problems - there the technology allows to lift into the air a huge number of airplanes without frequency intersections.  Minus 2.4 GHz in the relative high cost of equipment, especially receivers, which often suffer from vibrations or plane crashes. <br>  The number of channels - here the more the better.  At least 4 channels are required: <br>  - elevator <br>  - rudder <br>  - gas <br>  - ailerons <br>  There are models without aileron or rudder, but it is better to start learning on models with full control in order to immediately acquire all the necessary skills. <br>  It is better for beginners to take equipment with 6 channels at once, because from 4 channels you can quickly grow - after the first model, you will definitely want something more serious, for example, with flaps and a retractable chassis - you need 2 more channels.  From 6 channels it is possible not to grow for a long time. <br>  I stopped at a budget version of Hitec Optic 6 - 6 channel equipment, 40 MHz, has the ability to fine tune. <br><br><h2>  Flight start </h2><br>  Flights start in the simulator - the remote is connected to the computer, adjusted, calibrated, the model is selected, and forward - to the sky. <br>  It is clear that I immediately want to take something like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f21/683/32e/f2168332e171c1b26bab2ac09219b930.jpg"><br>  Still, it is better to choose something simpler, some trainer aircraft with the upper wing: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/02b/165/7b5/02b1657b533dfb224f1f1da2681d1c77.jpg"><br>  On such a trainer, you learn to take off, and land, take off and land, and when after each take-off, it is possible to land the model ground with a 95% probability - you can think about buying a real model.  From the first take-off in the simulator to the purchase of a model, I personally have a month passed. <br><br>  The simulator allows you to save a lot of money and nerves, because the probability of returning the model earth after the first take-off without training in the simulator is almost zero - none of my familiar model builders could do this, but 70% of them tried to start without a simulator and flew many only 3 models landed - the first two experienced literally several take-offs and not one landing. <br><br>  In general, this is my first article, if the topic is interesting, then I could tell you about the choice of model aircraft, the purchase of components, the first take-off in the real world (which, by the way, ended successfully), the first drop (about 20 take-off), about how and what models fly on, what are they made of, etc. <br><br>  And finally, a small video of what that part of model aircraft designers is seeking, which is not interested in the process of making flying copies and not reactive models: the so-called 3d aerobatics to music on a large gasoline model: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBm3Q4obAQg&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgH-AKEoGmZSt8OTFq4n7qhXD38Aw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/popular_science/90682/">Continued.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90669/</a></p>
