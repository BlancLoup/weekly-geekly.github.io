Just thoughts about sore. <br><br>  The last few weeks have been worrying me about 2 topics in terms of the Internet: <br>  1. Surveillance of organs. <br>  2. The variability of services. <br><br>  Well, they wrote about the first one very many times, and there is not much point in adding anything. <br>  In short, yes - we all knew it, but we were hardly relieved of the official confirmation.

      Well, we began to hear / read about the second almost every day. <br>  The most interesting thing is that this is taken for granted, i.e.  Well, yes, they closed one or another service for one reason or another. <br>  I did not use it anyway.  Well, or used, but not very.  So okay. <br>  Well, or even really enjoyed it, and I was sadly offended, but what can you do ... <br>  I will sign some petition so that it will not be closed and I will hope, although I clearly know that it will be closed anyway. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It strains me all this for the reason that at first they tried to accustom us to the clouds. <br>  Ie, your home computer is not reliable, better use our service: put your photos, videos, notes, bookmarks, mail, music, projects, code, etc. on it.  See how comfortable, beautiful, safe, easy and affordable. <br><br>  And the next day we read a new note: the service sold, closed, fell, lost data, was hacked. <br>  Or, on a cracker, changed the design or functionality to such an extent that it would be better if it simply closes or loses its own code. <br><br>  Just not to go far: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2580%25D1%258B%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D1%258F">an example</a> - half of them - is the closure of services or projects. <br><br>  What about us?  We are no longer put anything at all.  We are just statistics. <br>  For Facebook, Google, but why list - for all.  Just numbers. <br><br>  But think, all these services are no longer just entertainment and even non-working tools. <br>  Imagine your life without mail (in 90% of cases, you use some cloud service - Google, Yahoo !, MS, Yandex, mail.ru). <br>  And IM - where without them?  What about social networks?  And the phones?  The same androids or iPhones work in the same way with some services in the clouds. <br><br>  And each time we are happy to meet some kind of new, interesting service, we fill in a lot of our data, we set up, we advise our friends, to some extent we sometimes change our habits ... <br><br>  But all the same companies that tattoo on their foreheads and f ** ah all sorts of loud slogans in favor of and the protection of users, already the next day completely forget about them and just spit on us with a large bell tower. <br><br>  In their defense, you can say 2 things: <br>  1. It was not profitable for them in one way or another. <br>  2. It is their business - what they want, they do. <br><br>  And nothing can be done about it. <br>  At one time I was very worried about some services.  I wanted them to survive, gain more customers. <br>  And now ... Somehow do not care.  After Google Reader and Gtalk it became just all the same. <br><br>  I came to the conclusion that I had to go to my server.  And not even VPS (it makes no sense), but just home. <br>  Search for open projects: mail, XMPP, web server, ftp, custom phone firmware, RSS, etc. <br>  And yes, this is not so reliable - they can shine the light for longer than the UPS does;  can hack the internet ... <br>  But given his experience with providers around the world - there is not much difference. <br><br>  In general, even though I saw some sketches in the comments here and there, we can do something more organized: <br>  write the names of your favorite projects, which are placed on home servers.  It is desirable that the simpler installation and settings - so that not only for the elite. <br><br>  I'll start myself: <br>  Web server: Apache, nginx <br>  File-server: Freenas <br>  Firewall: pfSense (even though it is nothing, as a service) <br>  Music server: Subsonic <br>  RSS: Tiny Tiny RSS <br>  VPN: OpenVPN <br><br>  By the way, if you still take the VPS, then at the same time it will be possible to set up the VPN wisely, so that at least it‚Äôs more pleasing that I tried to fight ‚Äúwrestlers with te * po * ism, n ** o * ilya‚Äù , * ira * s, mat and other ills of the modern, otherwise simple, ‚Äú***, ideal Internet‚Äù. <br><br>  P.S.  As you can see, I did everything possible to keep this resource from being blacklisted. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188954/</a></p>
