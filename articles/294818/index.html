      This will happen later if your business survives in more or less difficult competition, and you realize that once it is time to develop and reach a new level;  that you are personally tired of calling and selling;  that your children have already gone to school, and your company has not been growing for the third year already;  it's time to work differently because your profits are falling.  Any of these motivations will be yours, whether long, shortly. <br><br>  This will become an obvious need when you face a cruel choice - to lose a business or urgently change something - in the company and in your head. <br><br>  Your project of building a sales system for your business will not happen only in one case - if you are a talentless manager who managed to leave the market and lose business, when everyone told him it was too late to start selling. <br><br><h4>  When your business is ready </h4><br><br>  When you are going on a long journey, you should have a backpack with provisions, good shoes on your legs, and your head should be clean. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Similarly, build a sales system should be when the prerequisites for its implementation.  The main prerequisites for the implementation of the sales system are as follows: <br>  a) cash supply for three to six months of work - because any before the car goes, you need to warm up the engine; <br>  b) standard conditions for the organization of work - an office for salespeople, computers, Internet, telephony, readiness to implement CRM; <br>  c) your mind, open to intensive study and free from a sense of self-importance;  and THIS IS THE MAIN CONDITION;  Compromises in the case of the first two conditions are possible, but without your clean, open and grateful head on your shoulders will not work. <br><br>  The budget of the project to build a sales system includes the following costs: salary of managers - 30-50%;  development of selling materials - 15-20%;  participation of consultants - 20-40%;  IT costs - 10-30%.  In absolute terms, in 2015 the sales department can cost you from 200,000 to several million rubles. <br><br><h4>  Alternatives </h4><br><br>  First alternative.  The path of trial and error.  You do everything yourself, stuffing bumps and saving the budget.  The advantages are obvious - invaluable experience, and if you succeed, you will become an expert.  Minus one - so many inefficient companies do, without achieving the desired results. <br><br>  Fools learn from their mistakes.  Smart on others.  Weak and stubborn do not learn. <br><br>  The second alternative.  Appeal to experts.  Pluses - a fixed time for completion of work, fixed or at least clear money, clear conditions.  Minuses - you need a budget and you have to work very hard at yourself. <br><br>  A consultant should be paid only when you feel that you are a child by the knowledge of sales next to him, and for helping him to grow up as quickly as possible. <br><br>  The third pseudo alternative.  Outsourcing schemes.  "You bring us customers, we pay you a percentage."  Frankly speaking, this is the favorite ‚Äúself-deception‚Äù of many entrepreneurs who have not overcome greed to choose Alternative 2 and at the same time have not won their laziness to pass Alternative 1. <br><br>  The very fact of the existence of a business that uses the outsourcing mechanisms in its sales testifies either to the great potential of the market or to the talent of the staff - but never to the foresight and effectiveness of the manager. <br><br><h4>  What is the project of building a sales system </h4><br><br>  The normal project of building a sales system includes three basic steps: <br>  1. process development <br>  2. hiring and training people <br>  3. accompaniment to achieve the result <br><br><h5>  Process development </h5><br><br>  As you call a boat, so it will float.  How do you develop a business process for the sale, and get this conversion.  What plan you put on such revenues and aim. <br><br>  During the development of processes it is recommended to <br>  - approve the sales plan for the next two years; <br>  - to formalize the scheme of the sale process and detailed regulations; <br>  - develop attractive materials for sending to customers; <br>  - think over the motivation system; <br>  - implement CRM; <br>  - develop a training course for sales managers; <br>  - write job descriptions; <br>  - create internal (confidential) regulations with recommendations for the head of the sales department. <br><br>  A professional in the field of building sales departments will cope with this preparatory work in one or two months.  If you decide to do everything yourself, count on three to four months and pay special attention to the scheme of the sales process and the system of motivation - these are the documents defining your future result. <br><br><h5>  Hiring and training people </h5><br><br>  This stage provides a direct reflection of the effectiveness of your recruitment and training mechanisms.  ‚ÄúSome freaks come‚Äù - select incompetent ones, ‚Äújumpers come across‚Äù - do not know how to sift out unpromising ones.  ‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt come to the result‚Äù - they scored for training, learn not well enough or do not teach at all. <br><br>  It should be noted that, on the whole, in Russia today, the crisis in the market of sales professionals has not only not been overcome, but has also worsened. <br><br>  Resume has become more, salesman skills in general remained at the same level, and the attitude to work and discipline deteriorated. <br><br>  Therefore, if you are counting on success, learn as well as you can.  Try your best and remember that this is a choice without a choice. <br><br>  Some tricks of hiring can be spied on separately <a href="http://greenbizzz.ru/publikaczii/kak-nanyat-xoroshego-menedzhera-po-prodazham.html">here</a> . <br><br><h5>  Accompanying to achieve results </h5><br><br>  When managers are trained and started working on your business process, the most important moment comes.  As a manager, your task is to ensure their output on the result, which will pay for your temporary and financial investments. <br><br>  What you need to do at this stage: the head - put your hands on the steering wheel and begin to actively manage revenue;  Managers - to develop a customer base and communication experience on behalf of the company;  colleagues - to provide information and moral support to young fighters of the commercial front. <br><br>  During the stage of reaching the result, the ‚Äúengine‚Äù of your sales system should not stall, and for this your attention to the process should be maximal. <br><br>  We, as specialists, pay maximum attention to this period, because here the most difficult and important process begins - the process of changing the consciousness and working habits of business leaders, and depends on how much the manager understands the new management tools and integrates into his schedule the success of the whole enterprise. <br><br><h4>  Three bad tips </h4><br><br>  Give the consultant how to do it.  Not for nothing you invited a specialist - do not hesitate, teach him. <br><br>  Be topless.  He is an expert in Africa and an expert that listen to him. <br><br>  Ask where in the revised version of the process such garbage appeared.  Indeed, how, after you personally spent an hour of your time, the scheme of the business process was so transformed and became, it seems, generally inapplicable to life? <br><br><h4>  How to squeeze the maximum out of building a sales system </h4><br><br>  1. Start applying recommendations as early as possible.  It is advisable to try to practice every piece of advice right the very next day - and better this very day.  In the worst case, you will realize that this does not suit you or does not work very well and ask for a different technology to offer. <br><br>  2. Absorb knowledge about building sales systems.  Books, videos, all consultant documents, colleagues' advice, articles on high-quality resources.  For four months of your project, you should only talk about sales, think about them daily, dream of them, live by them. <br><br>  3. Read all documents as early as possible.  Professional consultants give out a large amount of materials, in order to assimilate them, it takes time, so start immediately. <br><br>  4. Show respectful criticism.  Rarely does contempt of an expert end with a project‚Äôs success.  However, critical thinking should not be turned off.  The consultant may not take into account this or that subtlety, suggest a solution that is not very convenient for you, in the end, all people sometimes make mistakes. <br><br>  5. Speak all the important points, ask questions, communicate. <br><br>  6. Perform all tasks and requests.  Use this period to maximize the cohesion of your team and refine your interaction.  Remember - 75% of projects on the organization of the sales system show more modest results than you expected, because of you yourself.  Do I really need to meet with clients, enter everything in CRM, fulfill the sales plan and set an example for everyone?  Yes, it is for you, and you first. <br><br>  7. Do not forget about new leads!  More revenue at the end of the month?  - Hmm, do we need to increase the number of potential customers and do our marketing in general?  This correct question and the obvious correct answer to it will increase your chances even twice. <br><br>  They say that the Universe always helps those who really want something.  The best recipe for achieving success in sales is simple: if you really want to build a powerful sales machine, help your Universe affairs make you rich. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294818/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294818/</a></p>
