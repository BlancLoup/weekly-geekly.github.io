This formation always takes time.  Say 3-5 years old.  The sooner you start, the sooner you will become.  It is very important, in my opinion, not to lose time.

      In a programmer, it is not the technologies he owns that are important, but his thinking and experience.  The more technologies a programmer ‚Äútouches‚Äù - the wider his horizons, the more approaches he knows, the easier it will be to master something new. <br><br>  My approach can help to become either a very popular specialist in organizations or, on the contrary, to get rid of organizations - to become a freelancer or an entrepreneur. <br><br>  Described below - this is my personal experience and the experience of my best classmates, free from some rakes. <br><br>  So, my advice to an IT student. <br>  It is assumed that the student went to the 1st course after school and has no practical skills (but for the fact that he does not yet have practical skills - he should get a spoon in the forehead for smashing!). <br>  It is also assumed that the graduate school and the student‚Äôs scientific activities are not interested, and the student is not going to waste time on academics. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1 course. <br>  Program. <br>  Programming is necessary outside the curriculum and programming a lot.  For myself - to invent tasks and do them.  It does not matter which technologies to use - those that are interesting. <br><br>  The task of this item is to tame one's hands, to make programming a natural state for oneself, to form thinking.  Self-completed projects (albeit small ones) are a huge bonus, which will be your trump card for another three years.  The second task is to learn how to organize your workflow, to manage everything. <br><br>  2 course. <br>  Master the technology. <br>  See what's around now, work with different languages, different programming environments.  Continue to do independent projects. <br>  And also - make DZ lazy first-year students (for money!) <br><br>  The objectives of this item is to learn to learn quickly (:-D) and expand the range of starting areas. <br>  It is necessary that now when entering any new (albeit not very difficult) task, the student could open the documentation and start to implement it.  In addition, there will be a small portfolio in all technologies. <br>  The item about money is included in order for you to start spinning and learn how to earn money.  Let it be a little, but this is already a search for "clients", this is already developing proactivity. <br><br>  3 course. <br>  Work <br>  You can get a part time job at some company (and they will gladly take you without experience, because the first two courses demonstrate your activity, desire and willingness to learn and work), or you can start freelancing.  The first option gives growth as a programmer, specialist and developer.  The second option develops several other skills - proactivity, communication, survival. <br><br>  The objectives of this item are to learn to evaluate yourself, to learn to look at projects from the consumer and his needs, to form self-esteem and self-esteem (it is very important!).  Well, to pump over what is directly necessary for you. <br><br>  4 course. <br>  Decide. <br>  At the 4th course there is a minimum of time to determine the vector of your movement further.  If it is decided to be a valuable staff, it is necessary to develop skills in working with specific technologies ‚Äî study fresh materials, set new tasks ‚Äî become a guru in the chosen direction. <br><br>  If you choose the path of a freelancer / entrepreneur - you need to determine the range of technologies that will be needed to solve problems, you need to actively develop the portfolio and increase the volume of orders, build relationships with customers, learn to negotiate and submit information to inexperienced clients. <br><br>  The objectives of this clause are to prepare a solid platform for further development. <br><br>  5 course. <br>  Grow. <br>  The 5th course is the last year when the need to earn money is not critical (it is possible to afford to earn a little, for example).  On the 5th course you can still change something with minimal losses. <br>  There is no clear boundary between the 4th and 5th course in this ‚Äúplan‚Äù.  It is necessary to begin when you feel that it is time. <br><br>  I consider the 5th course as a platform for takeoff.  Preflight training is already completed, you need to take off. <br><br>  If the path of a valuable frame is chosen, then it is necessary to start a career growth.  I believe that it is better to go not over the heads, but to advance at the expense of personal qualities.  Therefore, these qualities need to be developed - it is necessary to become a good architect, designer, take the initiative in the development of projects, put forward ideas, argue with the authorities.  All this must be done regardless of the growth prospects specifically in your company - you need to train in yourself the necessary skills and thinking. <br><br>  If you choose the path of a freelancer / entrepreneur - you need to take projects more and more and start to build a team who will work with you on projects.  First, you can delegate small tasks, and then more and more technical work.  Find a suitable project will help you customer base, portfolio and the ability to communicate with customers. <br><br>  So what is next? <br>  And then you are old enough and experienced person to understand what you need and where to go. <br><br>  Slender turned out the picture, right?  Great) And now all together, mix, add, add 30% of errors, 2 dozen rakes.  Season to taste - with salt, if you are a pessimist, with pepper - if you are an optimist ;-) <br><br>  Past the post were the following questions: <br>  1. What specific technologies need to be looked at, where to take tasks for self-development <br>  2. How to combine all this with a full-fledged life and what place in this all girls occupy (and this is important !!!) <br>  3. Personal growth and personal development (this is also extremely important) <br><br>  I may answer these questions separately. <br>  But to be honest, everything that is described above and will be explained in these questions can be formulated with one line: <br>  <b>Always keep evolving!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70467/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70467/</a></p>
