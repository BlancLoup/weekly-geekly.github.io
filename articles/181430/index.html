The exception is if I have already read the books of this author and this is a continuation in the series. <br><br>  And here I read in the news brilliant that ‚ÄúWai!  Bad book publisher of a lamprey badge grandmother not to get past year! ‚Äù <br>  Already <blockquote>  ‚Äú10 million dollars last year and compared to last year, this amount has increased 5 times.  For this year we plan losses at the level of 30-40 million dollars. " </blockquote>  - said Oleg Novikov, Vice-President of the Russian Book Union. <br><br>  The fact that the RUSSIAN community counts money in dollars is strange, although our books are sold for rubles, but oh well ...

      I will not talk about the fact that people switched to reading rooms and tablets. <br>  Let's talk about such a good old thing as a ‚Äúwarm tube‚Äù paper book ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So why aren't people buying paper books lately? <br>  There are several problems and the most obvious: <br><br><h4>  Prices </h4><br>  We take, for example, the recently published book Babkin, "Necessary work." <br>  Ozone price tag - 133 or 86.40 rubles.  What is the difference - the Federal Law, but on the second "Antiquarian Edition" ... Damn it ... <br>  Labyrinth - 144 rubles. <br>  Liters - 59.90 ... HALF of the cost of a paper book for "pure text" !!! <br>  Etc.  etc. <br><br>  In the stalls and bookstores - 300+, 400+ and 500+ for books in this series. <br>  The exception is Auchan, where you can buy a similar book for those same 120-150 rubles. <br><br>  Ie, think about it, online stores sell, of course, not at cost, but have a steady profit. <br>  A "real" - fit the principle: <br>  - Let's zashim margin five times? <br>  - And let's!  But the people began to take less and profits fell! <br>  - Well, let's make a markup six times? <br>  - Let's!  But they took even less! <br>  - Eh, damn it!  Let's raise the mark 10 times?! .. <br><br>  As a result, people look at the prices of paper books and ... Shopping is the exception rather than the rule in recent years! <br><br>  Seamlessly move on to another item in our program: <br><br><h4>  Selection </h4><br>  When I found out that there was a new book by Babkin - I immediately rushed to the shops. <br>  ANYWHERE NO! <br>  Babkin in the blog is crying that it does not take her readers, judging by the reviews of the publisher. <br>  Several months passed, the book SUDDENLY managed to appear on LibRusEke !!! <br>  Well, I think, well, at least NOW IT MUST BE IN THE SHOPS ?!  Is it logical to assume that her pirates have scoured something from something ?! <br>  I go shopping - NO !!! <br>  His mother, her, and still is not in the "real" stores, three months after laying out LibRusEka !!!  In Ozone and Labyrinths - there is, in the "simple" - no !!! <br><br>  What is available? <br>  And FIG knows! <br>  Opened here at the metro store "Over 10 thousand new books!" - It was on the window. <br>  Logged in: <br>  - Max Fry is there? <br>  - Eeee ???  - blinked at me, "the seller-consultant." <br>  I call a dozen more popular authors, including Lukyanenko - the reaction is similar. <br>  - Damn, what is there ?! <br>  - Dontsova!  - the consultant who has come out of stupor is proudly responding <br>  - Sho, ALL TEN THOUSAND BOOKS - ONE DONTSOVA ?! <br>  It was two or three years ago. <br>  Now the shelves of many bookstores resemble a second-hand bookshop where you can easily find books a decade ago, but, alas, not a single novelty! <br><br>  And, further, there is a third point: <br><br><h4>  Search </h4><br>  Here you went to the online store, typed in the search engine the name of the book, chose, bought ... <br>  This is all good. <br><br>  And now we go to the "normal" ... <br>  Well, it is logical that there are shelves with fantasy, there are detectives, here is a child ... <br>  Yeah, but ... <br>  It would have been logical to arrange the books by series or by authors within these shelves ?! <br>  This is logical to us!  But not in any book! <br>  In one store I found the works of Lukyanenko on the shelves of DETECTIVE !!!  What a hangover - fz! <br>  But this is more the exception than the rule. <br><br>  In practice, books usually migrate within their habitat zones, but chaos, confusion and vacillation are already there! <br>  Here are the writer's books, N.  I heard that something new happened.  Nope  I look around with a spread in a couple of shelves-cabinets to the sides - no, they did not crawl away ... <br>  I go further, suddenly in the next row I come across a familiar cover and the last name of the same N! <br>  No, it's all the same fantasy!  The same publisher, the same series and the same author!  But inscrutable book workers shoved her into another row! <br>  WHAT FOR?! <br><br>  More fun when the author is published in several publishing houses: well, then the publisher decided, where he published about two dozen of his books, that the reader didn‚Äôt give a ride to the new series and refused!  And another with pleasure came from!  As a result, one series is here, the other is there, the first volume is in publishing house A, the second is in B, the third is also in A, but in another series of covers ... <br>  As a result, you can look for the desired volume until greening, because  it can pile up by the author, maybe by publication, or it can be scattered across all shelves at once! <br><br>  In libraries, we are accustomed to, that here are the authors on A, here on B, here on G, etc.  We find the shelf of the genre, we find a row with the right letters, we find a shelf with the right letters and we are looking for the author!  Everything is simple and intuitive! <br>  On the Internet, and in large libraries, there are card files where books can be sorted by series, by name, etc., which is relevant for a thread of the ‚ÄúUniverse of Metro 2033‚Äù cycle, which is written by three dozen authors. <br><br>  In bookstores, such an approach, if and when it was, then became extinct long ago. <br>  As a result, you may be ready to lay out money for the book you need, it CAN EVEN BE AVAILABLE, BUT ... You stupidly will not find it on the shelves !!! <br><br>  And all these three points lead us to the fourth: <br><br><h4>  Book stores close </h4><br>  The people do not take books, because  they are expensive, there are no new products, and the old ones can be found on the net, and even if it is available, it‚Äôs not a fact that you will find it on the shelves! <br>  And sellers want a salary, but the government wants taxes and rent, as a result, the store closes and ... <br>  Displays a new round, because  those buyers who went there and took something - lose the usual point, which ran after the institute or work.  Or on the way there to pass the time on the road for a new book ... <br>  Having not received a new ‚Äúdose‚Äù in a familiar place, the reader begins to think about buying an electronic reader, etc.  etc. <br><br><h4>  Total: </h4><br>  Where is this increase in losses five times? <br>  But all from here: the rise in prices, the lack of new products on the shelves, yet they are still new, the lack of a system in stores, the lack of stores! <br>  It is necessary to fight for profit, and not to whine like a puppy beaten by evil pirates !!! <br><br>  You can struggle with pirates as much as you like, but the paper literature industry is carefully buried by the sellers and publishers themselves! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181430/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181430/</a></p>
