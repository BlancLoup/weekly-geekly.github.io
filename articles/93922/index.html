  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The film "Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time", or about fake Christmas-tree toys</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Probably, each of us had the first Game.  The one with a capital letter.  I have become such a "Prince of Persia."  The first time I passed it to Dendy, because there was no normal computer yet.  Then, on the first of its own "two" with an EGA-screen, at first it seemed a miracle of technology.  Of course, on Dendy the ‚ÄúPrince‚Äù was simpler than on the PC, but the atmosphere of the game was pretty well preserved.  Then there was a lot of things on a variety of platforms, but the "Prince" remained a kind of standard of atmospheric pressure.  Well, he clung, to put it simply.  And, as far as I understand, not just me. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/249/789/ce9/249789ce94b6919c463dd7b0ca10d20a.jpg" alt="Prince of Persia"><br><br>  The second part, Prince of Persia 2: The Shadow and the Flame, was also nothing, but still I did not go through it the second time.  In the 21st century, when Jordan Mehner revived the series, I, of course, put Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time on the computer, jumped a little along the walls and ... erased.  No, I understand that it is now considered normal to call equally different games (the most recent examples recall FarCry and FarCry 2), but the new ‚ÄúPrince‚Äù was too different.  Jumping, as an end in itself ... So I better drive in Tomb Raider, there are such tukhes, such cries ... <br>  But now rumors began to reach that, according to The Prince, they would soon make a film.  Strange feelings arose in this connection: on the one hand, but how are they going to make a masterpiece in the first part?  I remember youth, I will look at the princess from different angles.  And on the other - well, how many films were weighed up by the games, and every time a rare glow sucks.  I tried to find at least one example of something interesting, but apart from the more or less tolerant Silent Hill, nothing came to mind.  Even Tomb Raider turned out to be a dull chewing gum, although, it would seem, Angelina Jolie consists of more polygons, and her eyes are fourth in size ... Well, you understand what I mean.  About every Resident Evil and Doom and say nothing.  Well, it is incomprehensible to me - why are directors trying to transfer gameplay to the screen?  What did I miss in the game?  I would like to add something to the already passed.  Prehistory, parallel line, perpendicular - well, so that it would be interesting!  And when the heroes blink and shoot the whole movie - so I'd rather go through the game once more.  With "Max Payne," so, in general, it happened.

      When I found out the title of the film - ‚ÄúPrince of Persia: The Sands of Time‚Äù, it somehow turned sour.  It became clear that it was not on the first part, but on the new series.  In Russia, it will begin to show from May 27, but I managed to see the ‚ÄúPrince‚Äù a little earlier, for which many thanks to the guys and girls from Russian Disney. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d11/6a9/94e/d116a994e5f0b11d4da16ad661afc180.jpg" alt="Prince of Persia"><br><br>  Well, what can I say ... If you suddenly decide to go to this film, first forget about the first part.  She is not there.  At all.  No  Well, that is, the princess is found there, but she is completely out of "Drugog Horad", and has nothing to do with the original.  By the way, cool - like a prince managed to save the princess, marry her in the second part, and in the third to be a bachelor again.  The theme of killing a princess or selling her in a slave market for not wanting to make a prince a quality omelet is not revealed at all! <br><br>  Second - turn off the brain.  From sin.  Because this film is a circus with horses, assassins, ostriches and snakes, and the so-called plot there is intended exclusively for pasting episodes.  Jump-jump, sit, jump-jump, walked - and so all the two hours.  Where they run, why jump - do not think, because it will turn convolutions.  I was pleased with the scene where the Prince and the Princess are captured by a flock of poorly educated gangsters from the Valley of Slaves.  The princess in the plot is very good (sorry only for the actress picked up ... um ... not perfect), and what would they do to her in real life?  Submitted?  Well, I, in general, too.  And in the film, filmed by Disney's studio, she was dressed in white and sent to serve drinks at the ostrich race!  So, yes.  There are still many such nyashek.  Especially delivered that megakinzhal, without which the Prince well, in any way, hid on a high tower, but hid brilliantly - the whole city knows about it.  And it was not a horde of guards who set him to guard, but one knife thrower.  Which the Good Negro quickly and pulled down.  True, the dagger still did not work out very well, but this is already another brilliant plot, I will not retell.  And, still in the movie constantly fighting.  It is terrible, with shouts, with sweeps.  But blood - not a bit.  Disney-s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/16d/02a/dbf/16d02adbff20aa3241162f91d329aaac.jpg" alt="Prince of Persia"><br><br>  Probably, if I was a child or simply not such a old fart as now, I would like a movie.  And filmed cheaply, and the eminent actors, and the director intelligent (shot "Four weddings and one funeral" and one "Harry Potter", the last).  At least, the youth behind the back whispered benevolently after the end of viewing - they say, what bright characters, how powerfully played.  I do not know.  I did not notice the game.  I saw only a children's film, where the characters play worse than in the Disney cartoon about Aladdin.  And instead of singing something cheerful, they sigat in different directions.  And instead of Jin, there is Sheikh Amar, who jokes very funny, but only two times. <br>  I don‚Äôt want to throw princely excrement into Prince of Persia;  probably for his audience he is quite and very.  But the memories of me almost twenty years ago are sitting too firmly in me, and I want an ATMOSPHERE. <br><br>  Which in the new film, despite all the costume and special effects, was not found. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/editorial/prince_of_persia_film">A more detailed review of the film, with pictures and a Russian-language trailer, I wrote for 3Dnews</a> , if you <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/editorial/prince_of_persia_film">'re</a> interested - go, see, read.  I will clarify - there the text is completely independent, when writing this post I did not even look at it :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/93922/">https://habr.com/ru/post/93922/</a></p>
