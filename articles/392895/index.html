He led the development of Charles Stark Draper, and the chief designer of the hardware was Eldon Hall.  Initial investigations were conducted by: Lanning Junior, Albert Hopkins, Ramon Alonso, and Hugue Blair-Smith.  Serial production was carried out by Raytheon, and its representative, Herb Taeler, was included in the development team. <br><br>  The computer used 2800 chips, each of which contained two elements exclusive OR.  The clock frequency was 2 MHz.  Weighed model 250 kg.

The read / write cycle of RAM and ROM took 11.72 Œºs.  The word length was 16 bits. <br><br>  From the point of view of the programmer of the ALU computer has four 16-bit registers: <br><br>  A - battery register, used for basic calculations. <br>  Z is the command counter that stored the address of the next program to be executed. <br>  Q is the remainder when executing the DV command (division), and the address of the return point after executing the TC command (unconditional jump). <br>  LP - the younger part of the product when executing the command MP (multiplication), the older part was stored in register A. <br><br>  The AGC user interface consisted of 7-segment numbers displayed on the panel and banners and a keyboard similar to a calculator's keyboard.  Commands were entered in digital mode as two-digit numbers: action and object.  The action described the type of operation being performed, and the object defined the data for operation. <br><br>  The numbers in green were displayed on high-voltage seven-segment indicators.  Indicator segments were controlled by electromechanical relays.  The display could simultaneously display three numbers of five digits in each, the display format could be both octal and decimal, and was used mainly to display the spacecraft position vectors or the required velocity change (ŒîV).  Although the data were stored in the metric system, they were displayed in the system adopted in the United States in those years. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d9/f2b/771/8d9f2b77177f4f239aa3a4b3fe70c24d.jpg"><br><br>  <i>An example of the internal structure of the chip</i> <br><br>  Further, the signal from the generator is not used directly, but is divided into 4, which gives us a frequency of 512 kHz - this is the main frequency with which the computer registers are updated.  But this action does not end the signal (512 kHz) divided by 5, we get a frequency of 102.4 kHz, which is further divided several times with a divider with a variable division factor to obtain a frequency of 100 Hz - this frequency was used for timers and system clocks.  Further, the 1 Hz signal used in the system clock is divided to obtain a frequency of 0.78125 Hz, which is intended for periodic polling of the so-called Watch Dog Timer (WDT - Watch Dog Timer), which checks whether the processor unit is ‚Äústuck‚Äù and, if a hangup occurs, interrupts the power supply processor block, without affecting the memory registers. </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392895/</a></p>
