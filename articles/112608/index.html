At the meeting there were a lot of partners who presented their new products to the public.  One of the partners was the company <b>DESTEN</b> , which announced its ‚Äúnot killed‚Äù laptops - they promised moisture and dust resistance, shock resistance and other bonuses.  Usually I am skeptical about such statements until I personally make sure of everything ... so I got up and asked a company representative to do a crash test on one of the laptops, with all the results published - whatever they were. <br><br>  Apparently, the company was so confident in their devices that without hesitation they agreed to my proposal.  He took the laptop for the winter holidays - it was interesting not only to check all the declared properties, but also just to see how things were going with notebooks from other companies ... so to speak, for a change) <br><br>  Unfortunately, the laptop was taken "naked", that is, without a box and other instructions - only the device itself and the network adapter.  Therefore, I cannot say that it is included in the package ... and I immediately propose to proceed to the review.  Meet - <b><a href="http://desten.ru/dn/export/sites/desten/general/production/cyberbook/U872.html">DESTEN CyberBook U872</a></b> .

    <h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The cover of the laptop is completely made of metal, the thickness of which, it seemed to me, is not less than a millimeter.  Small embossed "blotches", matte color - all neat.  All corners have massive rubber inserts to cushion the potential impact of a fall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ab1/6ca/875/ab16ca875fac4738b7f57ea5021678fc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  An important detail - in the corners of the lid are special metal protrusions that greatly increase the "scratch resistance" of the laptop - its body simply will not come into contact with the unevenness of the surface on which it lies.  A simple analogy is that it is much easier to damage the bottom of a sports car than a car with good ground clearance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/047/4d3/2b1/0474d32b133780037fcc661049372df8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A little bit about the connectors.  On the right is a solid cover behind which there are two USB connectors and a COM port;  Looking ahead, all of these connectors are part of a removable module that plugs into an external Mini Card slot (Mini PCI), which means that the functionality of a laptop can be enhanced if desired. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/167/824/ce2/167824ce2ffcb671406a365af67b238e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/378/5bc/bf1/3785bcbf1860709d9d0f46cfb4b30383.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c62/044/13b/c6204413baa60cd566d882b038af25a1.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ebb/089/dea/ebb089dea68761cada9bfd3a580386f6.jpg" alt="image"><br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>PCI Express Mini Card</b> (aka Mini PCI Express, Mini PCIe and Mini PCI-E) is a replacement for the Mini PCI form factor.  On the Mini Card connector bus: PCIe x1, USB 2.0 and SMBus.  For this connector standard, a mass of peripheral devices are available: WiFi modules, WiMax cards, GSM modems, GPS receivers, and even SSD drives.  There are leads for indicator LEDs, for connecting SIM-cards (for GSM WCDMA);  there are reserved pins for future devices.  Power supply 1.5 V and 3.3 V. </td></tr></tbody></table> On the left - behind the similar cover there are two more USB ports, one of which is combined with eSATA.  There is also an SD card slot and an ExpressCard 34 slot for various cards. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/506/3b9/a3f/5063b9a3f703bffa822b665b7689afa1.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4aa/2df/7e6/4aa2df7e651e1b19b025dd15092b030b.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  And very close is a rubber plug, behind which are hidden two audio jacks - for headphones and a microphone.  Behind there are also two plugs.  Behind the rubber - network connector for charging the laptop;  for metal - VGA and network RJ45. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/833/a31/6e1/833a316e137d9c6f9fea4024ddec01f1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  All metal covers open quite difficult - obviously not for gentle female handles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5c/9c3/7fb/e5c9c37fbcc8c2646b0eb642c5be7527.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So that the laptop does not accidentally open, there is a reliable metal lock on the front end - something like on suitcases) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ac/af2/f59/1acaf2f59a03a7347625c8d4bed7e499.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  There is also a rubberized handle - well, just like a suitcase!  It is flexible and, with its movable mechanism, goes to the rubber base of the butt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d1d/124/801/d1d1248010e472268096b54c92cbf033.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the back of the laptop there are several removable covers - it is even interesting what is behind each of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d5/538/261/3d553826138f43a66d127824e34b8eec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  For the one that was on simple latches - the battery (Li-Ion, 11.1V, 5.2A, 57Wh, model U12C). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/956/f11/fc9/956f11fc95962dcc53d421e80cbbcfad.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another one is a hard disk (the usual Western Digital is 250 GB; strange, but there were no protective means on the disk, except a few rubber pads in the mounts). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35e/db9/328/35edb9328106cb09069682edcec21bef.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db2/206/807/db220680773211d4e54860f586223ca1.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c35/af1/45d/c35af145d31c911e90d0c94838bd6e20.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/404/b0b/90c/404b0b90cf9a375e1e6dc629af416d45.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  For the remaining and largest cover was the most interesting - that is why I decided to leave it for the last.  So, two strips of RAM, or rather only one (2 GB) - the second can be set if desired. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/61b/5c8/fdd/61b5c8fddb70a4b9005272c9e4bf82b1.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a52/dc5/d46/a52dc5d46bb58807d1680f7f87ff59d6.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Next - a small Intel module, from which it took two wires;  Of course, these are wires to an external antenna, but for the sake of interest, I still unscrew it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ac/5f7/c23/7ac5f7c2348c027ce30a8538441c634a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  It turned out that this is <b>Intel WiFi Link 1000</b> ( <a href="http://download.intel.com/support/wireless/wlan/1000/sb/intelrwifilink1000productbrief1.pdf">PDF</a> ) and it is inserted into the same Mini Card slot, so there are already two such slots in the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee4/053/aaa/ee4053aaa9f52d8bd305f7b94493512e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Not less than I was surprised by the SATA connector and the power connector for connecting another disk - I don‚Äôt know how to fit it there (except 1.8 ‚Äù, and that would hardly fit). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a0/595/c3c/5a0595c3c7b9401c3cb681eecc29ac66.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, right there - wires and cables that go somewhere on the screen ... more on that later. <br><br>  There is also a connector near this cover, very similar to the docking connector.  But I did not find any information on this issue. <br>  The last "interesting" element on the bottom is a sticking "ass" of the stylus, which for some reason sometimes falls out) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/23c/482/b3b/23c482b3b14d16d1b4943e53faec542e.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  Despite the bottom rich in the number of elements, in general it is even and looks quite homogeneous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71a/e3c/ded/71ae3cded54003e576ef6761a493296d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The bottom is also metal (made of magnesium alloy), there are 4 rubber legs on it - again, so that the surfaces do not touch, and additional ventilation could be carried out in the gap. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48d/f50/840/48df508404b1fa1a87cd3cc5149b161d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The only thing that seemed illogical to me was that in the closed state there is a small gap between the keyboard and the screen;  on the contrary, everything should be sealed.  All the bottom is also metallic: <br><br>  The screen is quite thick and leans back 180 degrees, which is not so common in laptops.  Moreover, the screen is rotatable (also 180 degrees, only clockwise) and allows you to turn the laptop into a tablet - for structural strength, you can again use the lock under the handle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5a/666/2c5/f5a6662c5a3968b2b3a6008ef68da2eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ec9/d3e/185/ec9d3e1857e33b426140a11c987a39d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But even in this case, the manufacturer thought about the safety of the device - in the corners of the screen are all the same protrusions that will save the matrix when falling "flat." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b05/9c5/cad/b059c5cad6b129c238b0f059afe29bab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The rotary mechanism is metallic and, at first glance, quite reliable.  The screen keeps perfectly in any position in which you put it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/923/251/95b/92325195b256022982c9749e1ef3effe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The frame around the screen is matte and thick.  Top - a webcam, right - waterproof fingerprint scanner. <br><br>  Below - 8 buttons, the functions of some of which I did not recognize.  From recognized - the power button, microphone and display brightness control.  Another one completely (all) switches on the entire backlight - the screen, the LEDs, etc. ... while the laptop continues to work - it is not clear what this is for. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/22a/2df/9b1/22a2df9b13287260edc6335c3969899c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I forgot the most important thing - the screen itself is matte and moreover, the touch screen!  Not for nothing did they make a convenient stylus and the ability to form a tablet!  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a34/b6d/a3a/a34b6da3a2857ef6eb24043c266487b2.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60a/69e/6dc/60a69e6dcea241b53a1c9fc400d2d3c9.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Keyboard, as it is supposed to devices with a similar screen diagonal, without a digital block.  The buttons are square, with bevels;  Cyrillic on this sample was not.  I didn‚Äôt like the fact that FN on the left is to the left of the CTRL key, that Windows users tear all templates.  The keyboard is waterproof. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/91e/f58/8a0/91ef588a0c850f5db0ca470f016ce85c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Below is the touchpad, which also has moisture-proof properties.  It is relatively small, tactilely pleasant, it even had a place for the scroll area.  Below are two keys.  In the corners of the space around the touchpad there are two indentations - for those projections that are on the opposite side of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/39a/59e/049/39a59e049991b059c7425c7244ed01a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  After pressing the main button, the LEDs light up under the screen, which I did not even notice at first.  During boot, the laptop offers to enter the BIOS by pressing the F2 key.  For the sake of I go;  The first page provides information about the system - inside a dual-core <a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D47663">Intel Core i3-330M processor</a> and 2 GB of memory.  You can also turn on the Bluetooth, WLAN, WWAN and GPS modules in (s);  otherwise everything is more or less standard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9b8/557/e2c/9b8557e2c6baf3988665ccfbc0c9c724.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1c/a5e/305/a1ca5e30519c1ca3bd59d269db7c43d4.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Although I was surprised by the presence of two functions that I meet in laptops for the first time.  <b>Fan calibration</b> - this procedure takes about three minutes and during operation displays information about the various operating modes of the system cooler.  How is it useful?  Firstly, I was able to immediately estimate the maximum noise level from it - it is quite low.  But secondly, it seems to me, it can help to diagnose the cooler, if something suddenly happens to it.  There is also a function <b>Battery calibration</b> , which, as I understand it, is needed when using the device for the first time - it first completely discharges the battery and then charges it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fee/057/d58/fee057d58d2afe4082a306087b52fc29.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The full load time of Windows 7 on the laptop is about 30 seconds.  Unfortunately, there were no non-standard applications (except for Microsoft Security Essentials and the Protector Suite utility) - it looks like someone just installed the bare OS in advance.  I wanted to download something from the manufacturer‚Äôs website, but I didn‚Äôt even find a page for downloading drivers. <br><br>  The display is bright and even behaves quite well in the sun, but the viewing angles are not the best.  The stylus pen begins to influence the cursor from a height of about a centimeter;  very convenient form of the stylus. <br><br>  The screen is resistive and has good sensory properties, but the resistive coating layer itself under the working surface has irregularities along the edges.  In particular, at the most extreme points (where hardly anyone will reap) the pen does not work - for the sake of completeness, I made a screenshot in the diagnostic program, where everything is clearly visible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9e/e37/934/d9ee379344b4f11e44f769565a4ca066.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4e0/71b/b1e/4e071bb1e0735e5aab116fd9c392fd8d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  The operating time in the combined mode (a little wifi, medium intensity backlight) is about 4 hours, which is quite good ... on the other hand, there is an Intel Core i3 processor without discrete graphics, so I would like more impressive numbers.  During operation, the laptop is almost not heated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d7/27c/81e/7d727c81eff54cd537a0712cd077defc.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e2/8f6/d81/5e28f6d81e3498a8f2ebaa314d010b1b.png" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53a/839/963/53a8399636d310557d02c50629d6b147.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h2>  Crush test </h2><br>  Nothing lasts forever and this saying goes perfectly with laptops.  Some laptops can break even with normal use, not to mention deliberately disabling - there are a thousand and one ways to break a laptop in an instant.  But at once I want to warn the bloodthirsty readers - in this case we set ourselves the task of checking the laptop for survivability, and not ‚Äúsomehow more elegantly smash everything into chips.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  <b>Water</b> <br>  This was the first thing I checked out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8c/f86/89f/b8cf8689fda913efe9567dd6de524338.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, it was somewhat unusual to pour water into a laptop - stereotypes and all things ... nevertheless, I took a towel, 4 supports and several cups of water.  We watered plentifully - the keyboard and touchpad itself ... everything is without problems - the water just flows through the drain hole, and with a large number of it - also through the edges.  The screen and fingerprint scanner also have waterproof properties. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fb0/e38/e82/fb0e38e82be1c2bf66b8eabf368a0ef4.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12d/e2c/d85/12de2cd85566ba42998a05007d3b9105.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56a/cbe/68f/56acbe68f1dadc4b7452d7c4f516ebd3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  <b>Dirt and dust</b> <br>  It was not so easy to find the dust in winter, and in general I didn‚Äôt want to mess around ... but we rolled quite a bit in the dirt and snow of the laptop.

Nevertheless, the laptop withstood about 10 drops from a meter height - each time it was in working condition and in half of the cases it was in the open state - nothing terrible happened, it worked, and it continued to work;  a couple of times the lid turned inside out somehow, but not to the detriment of the hinge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/025/14d/d9c/02514dd9c0f2ac0b288235431b0f76fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/921/6f6/386/9216f6386065b78a94dc8ef7dc53b520.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  From one of the falls, my heart was bleeding from the very heart - it was about two meters high, and below was a concrete slab.  The laptop fell very badly - the hinge on the metal "ear" plate ... only after this fall on the laptop the first wound formed - a small dent on the metal case, but the device continued to work.  There were no bad sectors on the disk, although I suspect that all of this did not go to his advantage :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  <b>Pressure</b> <br>  I decided to take the laptop with me when my friends and I went to ride a buggy.  About an hour on the circuit of the autodrome lay a foreign body, according to which small funny cars drifted) But then I agree that this test is not terrible - the mass per unit area is quite small (and even a laptop in the snow), and the interaction time is even less . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/297/65a/a06/29765aa06130d5f2d5f25d2d607704f4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Later on the laptop got 70 pound buddy.  Including one foot (the smallest area) to the center of the display lid (where to push the case is easiest) - without complications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/155/0c2/3ad/1550c23ad273fb3e9a8ad573f6e71a17.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I dare to assume that nothing would have happened under an ordinary car with a laptop ...

Agree, it is unpleasant, when from any light source the cover of an ordinary laptop literally overflows with all sorts of small scratches?  There will be no such thing. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/80f/1fe/0ca/80f1fe0caf3f7e332bb7a8cb1009eccf.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/524/725/d92/524725d92bb91cbe97cb1a2b76f66709.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The claws of the kindest dog in the world left no traces on the lid.  A half-hour journey of the laptop (in the open state) in the trunk of the car, among the shovels and tool boxes ... easy! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/38e/a8c/50b/38ea8c50b685759b53c27c5e9de5f932.png" alt="image">  Clickable <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e0/9d8/d15/3e09d8d15d3fc8dda2f37f8038489e6d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ed8/441/cf3/ed8441cf3bfbde76054fce469b7dc84d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  When the girl was traveling on a laptop from an icy hill, I was afraid that the laptop would be exactly the same as after the bombing ... but no - after five such trips there were no scratches at all!

And maybe even protect;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8b/5e9/5b2/c8b5e95b231b5bfa0bed4ac39543a6c0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cf9/58c/c3f/cf958cc3f7362b7f8832e19fcade8cc0.jpg" alt="image">  Autopsy revealed </h2><br>  After all the tests, the laptop was still alive, moreover, there were practically no scratches on it ... but something did happen.  When I arrived home, the device simply refused to turn on - at that moment it even became somehow embarrassing) But it was reassuring that the laptop passed all tests unharmed, which means that nothing serious should happen.  First of all, I put it on charge, because during the tests I managed to completely discharge the battery - by connecting the device to the network, the charge LED on it turned on, which inspired optimism ... but the laptop still did not turn on.  Then I concluded that the whole problem is because of the snow that got inside, which melted and does not allow the machine to start.  Armed with a screwdriver and a can of compressed air, I proceeded to open the patient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/230/657/fd2/230657fd2e7bbba4a7282f2a45c589e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/557/b7c/fc9/557b7cfc906bb52efa540bf2401b880f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The first thing turned off the power, pulled out the battery.  I removed the covers of all the system compartments - inside there were really droplets of water that had been removed by a pair of ‚Äúpshikov‚Äù ... but the electronics behind the ventilation system simply could not get through, so I had to disassemble everything.  And that's what was learned during the showdown: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  The handle "goes" into the rubber corners, where it holds on to fairly thick but plastic protrusions;  and the handle itself in this joint is also plastic, albeit from a quality material.  This means that with a very strong (VERY strong) jerk, there is every chance of snatching the handle.  Now I am writing this paragraph, and I involuntarily recall a case from school, when a friend started spinning his suitcase, the handle of which could not stand the centrifugal force) The result - the handle from the suitcase in hand, and the suitcase, breaking two huge glasses, flew out into the street. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cb/7ae/3e3/5cb7ae3e3a32e1636c45b234345b9f85.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  Under the keyboard is a kind of pallet, also made of metal.  This pallet covers the entire surface and in one of the places has a hole - just the one through which the water goes (through the bottom).  This means that it was possible to pour at least a ton of water on the keyboard and touchpad - nothing would have happened with the laptop.  The same pallet adds mechanical strength to the notebook - I am almost sure that the keyboard (without prejudice to the stuffing) could be stepped on or even hit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bfc/5d9/e89/bfc5d9e89da7d142a5d4d88aa8372a83.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  In addition to insulated wires for video transmission, the screen goes to wires from wireless communication modules (usually antennas always go around the perimeter of the display) - all this is well protected from moisture by two metal cylinders of different diameters (one in the laptop case, the other in a hinge mount) which eliminates the ingress of water.  But much more I was pleased with the very fastening of the screen to the body - solid metal parts, a large number of screws ... it‚Äôs just that the screen will not fall off for sure - if you just ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù pull out ‚Äúwith meat‚Äù.  Bravo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ff/86b/817/3ff86b8177d00726340fd751e5d07463.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b1e/743/4e4/b1e7434e40339e522a2d798d60aabeac.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  I accidentally noticed that for the ‚Äútablet‚Äù state all the LEDs were duplicated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/33a/91d/0e5/33a91d0e55fb95428fef419a31b432e2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b3e/889/b17/b3e889b1765f9aad0e84f62cd76efbbc.png" alt="*">  Under the keyboard "tray" is all the electronics - to be honest, I expected to see much more) And there is only one large board of complex shape, a couple of loops and soldered microcircuits (including the processor from which the heat pipe goes to the ventilation system).  All electronics are covered with a thin and flexible plastic sheet that is glued to the board around the perimeter.  So getting moisture inside is really not that easy! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ce0/40d/4fe/ce040d4fe87b93a91ca14c5ee97671b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  However, it still got.  And as it is easy to guess, through the ventilation system, it is she who is in this laptop ‚ÄúAchilles heel‚Äù and it was in her area that I saw water droplets.  It took a couple of minutes to thoroughly blow the entire system ‚Äúfrom the inside‚Äù with compressed air, after which I tried (in a disassembled state) to turn on the laptop.  Hurray, he earned.  I started assembling a laptop, concluding that a laptop is no good except as a paddle - they can row, but then they will have to look for compressed air;) It‚Äôs hardly possible to recycle the ventilation system - only use passive cooling ( due to direct contact of the radiator with the body), but this is most likely possible only with even less efficient iron. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6be/b3b/51c/6beb3b51ce9ee34445061fab3363411e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20a/229/4b1/20a2294b128117dcb752679b1da35114.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Honestly, I never took DESTEN seriously before, although I almost never came across it ...
