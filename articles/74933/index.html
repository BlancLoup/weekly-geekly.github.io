  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Covers for RPW ‚Ñ¢: how it was</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It all started with a competition.  In one of the releases <a href="http://rosnovsky.ru/archives/category/podcast">of the RPW podcast</a> , Artyom announced that he needed a logo and asked everyone to send him his versions.  And the rest of the listeners had to vote for their favorite option.  And now, when there were already a lot of sent options, I also decided to go in and see what was drawn there.  I don‚Äôt want to offend the authors, but everything was more than terrible :(. And then I got the idea, why, actually, should there be a logo on the cover of the podcast? . <br><br>  After several hours, the first pictures appeared, which went to Artyom with a description of the idea: <br><img src="http://pic.designer.dp.ua/lj/091111/rpw_begin.jpg" alt="First pictures"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I liked the idea.  ‚ÄúExcellent!‚Äù - I thought, ‚ÄúWe need to draw a few pictures that will correspond to the main topics that are discussed in the podcast‚Äù.  And in order not to draw them all at once, I decided to do it in stages and accumulate all possible options for several issues and then only change the issue numbers.  But I had to break off :) It is good to prescribe tags when the podcast is already recorded.  But, in most cases, the author himself could not exactly say which theme would be the main one.  It became clear only at the moment when the recording began.  But by this time it would be nice to have a ready-made cover so as not to delay with laying out the episode. <br><img src="http://pic.designer.dp.ua/lj/091111/rpw_first.jpg" alt="First covers"><br><br>  There was another difficulty.  The podcast went out irregularly, at a time when Artyom was more convenient to write it down.  And at first it happened that I just did not have time to draw a cover.  It was only after several releases that the interaction was more or less managed.

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      Well, then it went on: Artyom sent me sketches of shounots, and I tried to guess what exactly he would tell.  Sometimes it turned out badly :) and the cover theme was not included in the podcast at all or was far from the main one: <br><img src="http://pic.designer.dp.ua/lj/091111/rpw_bad.jpg" alt="Podcast was not about that"><br><br>  Sometimes I openly hooligans (gingerbread men are satisfied with the author's diet): <br><img src="http://pic.designer.dp.ua/lj/091111/rpw_funny.jpg" alt="gingerbread men are happy with the author's diet"><br><br>  Sometimes I tried not to bother with drawing and working out details, as time was running out: <br><img src="http://pic.designer.dp.ua/lj/091111/rpw_fast.jpg" alt="No problem"><br><br>  Sometimes, on the contrary, I wanted to pozamorachivatsya: <br><img src="http://pic.designer.dp.ua/lj/091111/rpw_hard.jpg" alt="With the details"><br><br>  And so more than two years flew by unnoticed and more than 70 pictures were drawn.  During this time, Artem and I got involved in the regime, and it became much easier and more predictable. <br><br>  I perfectly improved my skills and worked technicians in drawing such pictures, learned to think faster in extreme situations and find non-standard solutions, which helps me a lot in regular work.  So, two years have become much richer and more interesting than they could be.  I hope the author of the podcast will pass his stage of rest from the pokkast and he will give me a job again, although the cover for the still unrecorded release is already lying and waiting for its time: <br><img src="http://pic.designer.dp.ua/lj/091111/rpw_secret.jpg" alt="Censored!"><br><br>  For those who read, click through the Bonusterek: all covers in full size (traffic!): <br> <a href=""><img src="http://pic.designer.dp.ua/lj/091111/rpw_small.jpg" alt="Wow all people"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/74933/">https://habr.com/ru/post/74933/</a></p>
