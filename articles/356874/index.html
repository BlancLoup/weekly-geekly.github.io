  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Snowden merged new documents on the government program of extermination of people using drones</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Resource The Intercept has <a href="https://theintercept.com/drone-papers/">published secret documents</a> of the US Department of Defense on a program to kill people with the help of UAVs, which was used in Yemen, Somalia and Afghanistan with the approval of the country's top leadership.  From the materials for example, it follows that US President Barack Obama personally in 2012 authorized the killing of at least 20 people in Yemen and Somalia, and who exactly became the targets of the operation is not called.  During the period from January 2012 to February 2013 in the north-east of Afghanistan, more than 200 people were killed by drones, while only 35 of them were pre-planned targets for the attack. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The authors of the leak were the well-known Edward Snowden and Daniel Ellberg, who in 1971 also published the secret Pentagon documents about the Vietnam War, but after a trial under public pressure, was acquitted.  Since the documents contain information on the use of drones for such purposes, which the public already guessed from in numerous films about the work of the special services, the main reason for their publication is that to draw attention to the fact that the special services use an ominous weapon extremely and very illegible including innocent people. <br><br>  As far as can be understood from the materials, there are two separate programs for the use of UAVs as a weapon for murder - separately in the CIA, and separately in the US Department of Defense.  Apparently, the published documents relate to both programs, because the intelligence officer who worked in both departments is called the source of information.  From the presentations it becomes clear that there are special methodological instructions for the special services employees engaged in such programs.  These instructions, for example, require before the attack to determine a special parameter CDE (collateral damage environment, collateral damage to others), which shows how many people who are not the target of the operation can be harmed.  In particular, at least two separate agents must provide consistent information that the target of the attack is indeed in the right place.  Apparently, often the value of CDE was not taken into account. <br><br>  This is how the request from the military looked to be removed from the air using the drone of one of the alleged leaders of the Taliban Kvari Munib.  The operation was carried out in northeastern Afghanistan:

Actually the operation to eliminate the target is denoted as ‚ÄúF3EA‚Äù.  This abbreviation means several steps at once: ‚ÄúFind a person, Fix a person, Finish them‚Äù.  Under the letters "EA" understand the analysis of the success of the attack - "Exploit and Analyze".  A successful shot at the target of the operators is usually called the word ‚Äújackpot‚Äù (jackpot), while casual victims affected by the shot are abbreviated as EKIA (enemies killed in action).  If it is required to shoot not at a person, but at the signal of his mobile phone, in case of success such an attack is called a ‚Äútouchdown‚Äù.  This is how the printout of the movements received from her phone looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/62a/6be/238/62a6be238e3ba85a90c78edc399ce050.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356874/</a></p>
