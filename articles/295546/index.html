  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Customer service: from online to offline</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How many articles you have come across about how to search and work with clients on the Internet?  Each company gives its own practical tips and tricks, most of which boil down to sending personal messages to each client or ringing with a reminder about themselves.  How effective such methods can be, given that the client is likely to receive a bunch of messages from different companies on a monthly basis.  Your message may simply be ignored at best, or, at worst, you will be added to the blacklist. <br><br>  It is necessary to work with clients and offline.  How to do this, we will explain further. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/f33/3ad/561/f333ad56128c9bb329294bf732815c95.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Professional thematic events held by small companies in order to increase brand awareness and conquer the local market are gaining increasing popularity. <br><br>  Each company, even the smallest, can easily recruit 10 - 15 people to their first professional events.  To do this, simply use your customer base and social media pages.  Moreover, you can ask partners to invite their clients to meet with you.  We can say with confidence that they will agree to help you in return for a small mention of them at your event. <br><br>  When guests gather, spend about half an hour to communicate with them, some will still be late.  You do not need to be a highly qualified inaccessible professional, try to speak with clients as with "children".  Imagine yourself in their place: they have come to you to get new knowledge and, perhaps, do not quite understand the subtleties of your business.  Be as friendly as possible, ask what they do, exchange business cards - all this will help you build strong relationships with potential customers. <br><br>  Do not doubt that after people personally meet with the specialists of your company, they are more likely to start working with you further. <br><br>  Conducting at least 1-2 events per month, you can significantly improve the company's reputation in the local market and find new customers. <br><br>  <b>Here are a few tips to make your events less ‚Äúbland‚Äù:</b> <br><br>  - <i>Invite the eminent speaker</i> .  This may be an expert in some field who writes articles and participates in conferences or a representative of a better-known company.  In any case, it will attract the attention of potential guests. <br><br>  - <i>Melt the ice.</i>  Let your guests feel that they are really welcome at your event.  Do not be afraid to acquaint guests with each other.  People are easier to be in the same room, if there are many friends. <br><br>  - <i>Offer guests drinks and snacks.</i>  A cup of tea or coffee with small toasts will be most welcome at such events.  At more informal events, where there will be a lot of young participants, you can offer beer or wine with pizza.  Such meetings will not only be remembered, but will be desired in the future. <br><br>  - <i>Do not make yourself the center of attention.</i>  Speak more precisely not only about yourself and your business.  People will not want to spend their time listening to how great you are.  They will come to you to meet the same people as themselves: with the same interests and problems.  Give everyone a chance to speak out and become the center of attention.  Let people be heard. <br><br>  - <i>Post photos from the event.</i>  There is no better way to show how interesting your meetings are, how to place several photos in social networks and blogs.  Some users will want to share them on their pages, which will give you additional advertising.  And also show new potential guests that you have fun! <br><br>  You can find out a little more about holding events in our previous articles: <br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/19734/">How can thematic events help your business?</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20214/">How to conduct professional events with business benefits?</a> <br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating and organizing your group of meetings is for your clients to meet you personally. <br>  Instead of an epilogue, we would like to say that the OneMarkt team has opened a parallel project called YavGroup.  This is the place to create your own community for events.  You open your group, describe what you do and create events.  Then you can talk about your Group of meetings in social networks and blogs, attracting new members. <br><br>  <a href="http://yavgruppe.ru/">We invite everyone to try our service - YavGroup</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295546/</a></p>
