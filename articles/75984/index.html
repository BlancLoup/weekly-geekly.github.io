  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Return mobile phone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the beginning of the year, I acquired a Nokia 7310 phone. The device was needed for a large number of calls, some SMS and GPRS / EDGE (depending on what they give).  The purchase was made at the M.video store in Moscow (Shchelkovskoye shosse, 100). <br><br>  The device served faithfully ... However, a few days ago the oddities began ... <a name="habracut"></a><br>  It took to count.  Opened the calculator in the phone.  I began to enter numbers, but some of the numbers are not displayed on the screen ... I scored on it without attaching special significance.  After some time it was necessary to call.  Dialing the number.  I must say that I, by long-standing habit, dial all the numbers in the form +79123456789, in the international format.  And on the screen I see +91234569.  That is, numbers <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> are not dialed.  Cool ... I can not dial a number through <b>+7</b> , on <b>8</b> !  Achtung!  I got a mobile phone, it seemed to work ... In the next couple of days, the disease progressed. <br><br>  On Friday, 11/21/2009, I, having been released from work a little earlier, decided to use the warranty obligations of the phone seller.  I came home and prepared a <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/197372/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F.odt">complaint</a> within an hour.  In a nutshell about my requirements.  I did not want to get in touch with the repair, because it doesn‚Äôt guarantee from glitches in the future for a long time, so I needed a refund.  I was not opposed to conducting a quality check, but with my personal presence.  With this claim, I went to the above store.

      I went to the department with phones and turned to the first seller. <br>  "I have a return phone, who can take the claim?" <br>  In response: "You need to service." <br>  I: ‚ÄúI would see someone from the management who can accept my claim.‚Äù <br>  In the next half-hour I was ‚Äúkicked‚Äù from one to another, but in the end some manager came out.  After a small altercation, he said: "Wait, I must contact the lawyers." <br>  After some time he came to me and offered to check the quality of my phone.  Came back to the phone department.  Together with the same seller, they began to violently press the buttons.  Buttons <b>7</b> and <b>8</b> basically worked, but still did not react several times to pressing.  ‚ÄúYou are so wrong to press!‚Äù Aha! .. Wait again.  Half an hour later, they found the director and said that they were ready to meet my requirements.  To which I said that since everything is solved amicably, and I still need a phone, I‚Äôm ready to simply buy another phone from them and not take the money.  On that and decided. <br>  Another half an hour to issue any statements with the participation of my passport, and I, having paid the difference of 1400 rubles, get a new phone.  This time Nokia 6303. <br><br>  As a result, an hour to draw up a claim, which in the end was never accepted.  Another two and a half hours waiting for the final.  And I am the happy owner of a new phone. <br><br>  PS All conversations, both from my side and from the side of the store employees, were in a calm and polite manner. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75984/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75984/</a></p>
