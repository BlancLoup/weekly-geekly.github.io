      <b>Legend:</b> <br>  - Phrase third-party hero <br>  * Phrase protagonist <br>  * No sign * - thoughts of the main character <br><br>  Again these terrible, large wooden doors in this cell called school.  I remember how a year ago they put this idiotic system of entry and exit on cards, and the queue at the entrance and exit pass through the same iron roulette, which will not turn until you attach your card to it and time data is entered in the system input or output.  It all takes an enormous amount of time and therefore huge queues accumulate at the entrance and exit.  Idiocy?  Think about what can happen from children, even if adults allow such blunders.  Okay, I went to school, now God forbid to get out of it ... <br>  As usual, the school is unusually noisy, which lays the ears.  How unusual it is, when there are so many people around, I want to go somewhere far away, where no one will find you, lock yourself up and not think about them.  I want to be alone with myself, but now it‚Äôs not available to me and through this screaming, jostling crowd I try to get to the locker room to leave my things for several hours all alone, where no one ever watches them, even though there is a cloakroom attendant.  This old aunt does not see anything further than her nose and is more rude and cursing than helping.  In general, it remains to rely only on themselves, as always.  So, I hung things, in the farthest corner, so that the pocket thieves got to her only with a very big hunt, although this happened more than once ... <br>  Today I have the first chemistry lesson, it means that I need to the second floor.  Again, you can only go along the right stairs, because this is the stairs up, and down only on the left, because it is respectively down.  Rules, rules and more rules.  This cage is one big rule that makes us obey them, teaches from the earliest years that we become a flock, because the flock is easiest to manage ... <br>  Chemistry Cabinet is located at the very end of the corridor.  In the corridor there are two attendants, class 10 or 11, it is not clear, but what is most interesting is that the 5th class of attendants is not going to listen at all.  Moreover, they are rude to them and may even strike if they are touched.  And you cannot prove that the child does not want to obey, all the same, the truth will be on his side, so that he can feel the power that can come to him if he is arrogant, angry.  Yeah, but on the left you can see a drunken seventh-grader who barely keeps his feet and sticks to his classmate, who is not embarrassed by this and even kisses him with pleasure, despite the terrible fumes.  How is it disgusting!  Here is the door that I need, so I am ready to plunge from one terrible world of corridors to another terrible world - an office with classmates ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86945/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86945/</a></p>
