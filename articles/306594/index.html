Often, as a result of such work, good projects are obtained, but the path to them is thorny and costly.  And all because a lot of time goes in search of mutual understanding. <br><br>  On the account of "Eurostudio" already more than 2000 projects, and our managers managed to communicate with the most different customers.  Focusing on our experience, the experience of colleagues in the ‚Äúworkshop‚Äù and their comments, we have compiled ‚ÄúBad advice‚Äù for ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù customers of web studios and digital agencies.  If it is not you, then in no case read further (although no, read). <br><blockquote>  <i>You want to move</i> <i><br></i>  <i>In Yandex, in Google, in the top 10?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Order everything at once</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Do not give explanations</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And all unanswered letters</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Feel free to leave</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And then ask menacingly</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Have a web studio report</i> </blockquote>

    <h3>  Be mysterious </h3><br>  Set tasks without specifics, discuss in general terms.  Of the 20 questions in the manager's letter, answer only one.  To specify something, ask the performers to think and decide for themselves.  However, demand specific figures for profit at the stage of discussion of the problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/070/7aa/544/0707aa544f564345ac16d89403a25360.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Inflate requirements </h3><br>  At the first meeting with the manager, say: ‚ÄúWe want a site like Apple‚Äôs, only the fonts you need to use are our branded ones, add news feeds on the side and bring them to the principal greeting of the director.  The budget is very limited! ‚Äù. <br><br><h3>  Ignore </h3><br>  You are asked a bunch of questions about business, products, services?  Why do they need it?  Have they conceived something?  Do not answer these questions!  Do not pick up the phone, ignore the letters, do not appear online.  Let them search for information themselves, because they need it, not you. <br><br><h3>  Require progress reports more often. </h3><br>  And the more often, the better.  Let them not relax and know that you are not indifferent to the fate of the project and the money that you invest in it.  Total control mode is your choice! <br><br><h3>  Do not give explanations </h3><br>  In response to a question about a photo for an article, send to the manager a chain of 20 letters in which three of your employees discuss this issue.  Do not explain which specific picture from the chain of letters is worth taking. <br><br><h3>  Go on a business trip before the settlement day </h3><br>  After all, nothing terrible is that you pay later, right?  The manager's salary is tied to payments on time?  But they have many clients, and you have more important things to do.  Be sure to pay the bill, but later. <br><br><h3>  Do not trust anyone </h3><br>  Especially if the color is discussed over the line separating the column in the footer of the site.  And do not delegate communication on the development or promotion of the site to any of your employees, even if you leave for 3 months to hitchhiking in Peru.  Get to wai-fay - answer sure! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b0b/fc2/f97/b0bfc2f97e3c41c3af06429546d0f177.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Write angry letters </h3><br>  For the sake of prevention!  Even if you are satisfied with the reports on the work done, they began to visit the site more often, the average purchase check increased.  But Vasily Ivanovich said that he did not understand something on the site or did not find it.  Report it to the manager, angrily, remembering all. <br><br><h3>  Ask for "beat" and move </h3><br>  It doesn't matter what it is - fonts, color scheme, image in the header of the site, text for the service.  The best comment "Everything is fine, but ..." and further it is necessary to provide an impressive list of edits for the works that are currently being conducted for you.  Pay special attention to edits, such as "let's move it 2 pixels to the right, and here we darken it to 1 tone." <br><br><blockquote>  <i>When you need a website urgently</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Just like Apple</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And your budget is limited</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Never hurts</i> <i><br></i>  <i>All specifically discuss</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Well, after daily</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Hurry, customize</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And write a lot of letters</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And when the layout is sent</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Claim very long</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Edit 100500 enter</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And then in a serious tone</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Ask the designer</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Play with the font</i> <i><br></i> </blockquote><br><h3>  Show power </h3><br>  Create an unfavorable situation in your team, demonstrate dissatisfaction with someone else's work, promise to dismiss everyone.  Scold your employees so often that they do not want to discuss anything with you, but simply transmit messages.  In any incomprehensible situation, promise to leave a negative review on the work of a manager or a studio. <br><br><h3>  Discuss a lot </h3><br>  Call and email your account manager often, focus on conversations, meetings and discussions.  Discuss the slightest change, ask how are things on the phone every day, ask to make a table, draw a schedule, send a presentation.  Try different forms.  Plan a lot and postpone. <br><br><h3>  Constantly add new requirements </h3><br>  Approved the design of the main page, imprinted?  Ask to add one more block right here.  Is this something to change? <br><br><h3>  Save money </h3><br>  Suggest studios to do only part of the work, for example, only design.  And the rest will be made by your employee, who previously worked as a programmer somewhere.  Let your manager write the texts for the site.  But the studio will be responsible for the final result. <br><br><h3>  What is the agreement? </h3><br>  When you are sent layouts, texts, edited files for approval, promise to see and do not respond to these letters as long as possible.  Ideally, this time you can even hide, go on vacation or go on a business trip.  And then, after about a month, clarify that the studio is delaying the deadlines. <br><br><h3>  Your opinion is more important than the opinions of your customers. </h3><br>  The site should like, first of all, you, your wife and relatives, and not potential customers.  Therefore, the font should be Times New Roman, color - red, and the news - on the first screen and always in the amount of five pieces.  And in general, ‚ÄúNo one is already looking for Google, I'm not looking.  We need to promote the site in Rambler. " <br><br><h3>  We are many and all - directors </h3><br>  Does your company have many co-founders and department heads?  Connect to the discussion process of all!  Let everyone speak out.  Their opinions are important, everything must be considered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e54/2a8/98c/e542a898c0f3499ebbccf9969fb4c238.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Dictate by phone </h3><br>  Immediately tell the manager that you do not like to write letters and respond to messages, it is easier for you to call and dictate the answers to the questions by phone.  Even if it is the text in the section "About Us" for 2000 characters. <br><br>  Read?  Perhaps you learned in the compilation of their "difficult" customers, but in another field.  Send us your stories!  But I must say that for us an ideal client is not a silent businessman with an agreeable character, that is not the point. <br><br><h3>  The ideal client is one who: </h3><br><ul><li>  knows his business well and is ready to work with us for its development; </li><li>  can sometimes be harsh and speed up the process, give us a whipping - no problem!  Clear requirements and moderate rigor only contribute to the process; </li><li>  ready to delegate part of his duties to his employees to speed up the process, his company has an organizational structure; </li><li>  He understands that the site is being made and is being promoted for clients, so he is ready to give us as much information as possible about them, including their needs, and to trust our experience and professionalism, avoiding subjective evaluation.  He is for experience and statistics. </li></ul><br><br>  We value even very complex customers, because it is with them that new solutions or detailed instructions are often born.  This is definitely a useful experience for our managers, albeit a difficult one, and not always leading to a good result. <br><br>  We are waiting for marketing stories and case managers, as well as bad advice from marketers and client managers!  <a href="">Email</a> us at <a href="">info@eurostudio.ru</a> or in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306594/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306594/</a></p>
