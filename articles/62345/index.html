  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Assessing the importance of site components when working with clients</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is such a problem when working with clients - they can not always say for sure what is most important for them on the site.  I used to think that this is a 100% customer problem in determining their desires and their priorities.  This hour has changed a bit about that.  The client should be helped to determine the important and non-important aspects of the site being developed. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order to help the client, it‚Äôs necessary: ‚Äã‚ÄãYou are the project curator (manager), the client‚Äôs representatives.  Everyone knows that the client should be represented by one person.  It is right.  But the representative does not always make all the decisions.  Even if it is written on a piece of paper, the director can always come ... <br><br>  In total, we have participants: you (in one person) and representatives of the client (many individuals who will be involved by the client in decision making). <br><br>  You may not meet everyone in person, but you must collect information about what should be on the site.  For example: news, product catalog, press releases, prices are published, etc.  Make a label in Excel and sort it alphabetically (although you can sort it as you like, the main thing is not by importance and not by price).  Make two columns: importance for the company (i.e., quantification of the company's desire to make this item) and need (that is, how much is necessary for the client). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      These are two different points.  Here you will need a lot of effort to explain the difference between these points.  For example, the company decided to make a website and place on the website all certificates / awards of the company and the catalog of goods.  It may be extremely important for a company to place its awards, and they will always talk about it.  And for customers, first of all, there will be an assortment with prices.  So it turns out that you need two columns.  The difficulty is that not all clients understand that what is important for them and important for their customers are ‚Äútwo big differences‚Äù (c). <br><br>  Distribute the Excel file to all customer representatives and ask them to fill in the appropriate two columns.  You must first set two scales (its own for each column). <br><br>  I think the scales should be like this: <br>  Importance for the company: <br><ul><li>  critical [value - 3] </li><li>  must be placed [value - 2] </li><li>  I would like to place [value - 1] </li></ul><br><br>  Importance for customers: <br><ul><li>  always ask managers about it [8 to 10] </li><li>  Often interested in this information [5 to 7] </li><li>  some are interested in this information [2 to 5] </li><li>  I do not remember what customers would ask or say about it [1] </li></ul><br>  It is better for the client to bring these scales in words.  For yourself, you must arrange tsiferki.  My example is in brackets on scales.  If the client is very good and smart, then you can offer to put tsiferki, it will be a more accurate assessment.  If the client puts words / phrases, then you put tsiferki. <br><br>  From each representative we receive such a sign.  How to bring a sign into one is already a matter of technology.  It is possible arithmetic average, it is possible weighted average and director more weight. <br><br>  As a result, you have one table.  Add another column.  When calculating risks, it is called ‚Äúinfluence‚Äù.  We call it ‚ÄúImportance.‚Äù  The value in the ‚ÄúImportance‚Äù column is calculated by multiplying the two corresponding columns.  Sort the entire list by the ‚ÄúImportance‚Äù column. <br><br>  You have a list of what the customer needs. <br>  What do you do with it next - your business.  And what can you do with it: <br>  if there are no prices for the site, then calculate the price for the corresponding desires and make the column ‚Äúcumulative‚Äù.  The client will find a reasonable price and cross out all lower; <br><ul><li>  while developing the design, you know what the emphasis should be on, so that customers are satisfied and the director doesn‚Äôt move the ‚Äúlogos‚Äù; </li><li>  if the site is very large, then this may be the order of the modules implementation; </li><li>  check the points at the top of the list personally, the rest can be given to employees / testers for testing / etc; </li><li>  when talking to customers, you know what to focus on. </li></ul><br>  And every manager for himself already decides what to do with such a sign. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62345/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62345/</a></p>
