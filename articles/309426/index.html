Further success of the project directly depends on the content, in other words - on the content.  Content is a powerful lever of influence on potential customers, buyers, readers and subscribers. <br><br><h3>  Content feature in site promotion </h3><br>  Filling the site with content allows you, first of all, to provide guests of your resource with complete information about the project, products and services.  "Dumb" resources that do not have a semantic content, will cause only bewilderment for the visitor who has come, who cannot become your client.

      Many may ask, ‚Äúwhy fooling - you can take content from other resources.‚Äù  This is especially true for information projects.  Of course, you can copy other people's articles, you can paste links to other people's videos.  But at the same time you need to be prepared that a reasonable search engine will consider your resource at best - low rated, at worst - will apply sanctions and simply block. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/489/223/4b4/4892234b4b4d4f2f81c0d75499862d83.jpg"></div><br><br>  Also, a low percentage of uniqueness and uninteresting content will not bring the resource to the top and will not attract visitors.  Therefore, high-quality content for the site is one of the most significant guarantees of further success. <br><br>  In addition to uniqueness, it is important to take into account such concepts as: <br><br><ul><li>  keywords; </li><li>  SEO optimization; </li><li>  spamming; </li><li>  academic and classical nausea; </li><li>  re-linking, etc. </li></ul><br><h3>  How to fill the site </h3><br>  There is an erroneous opinion that the content is a purely textual content of the web pages.  However, this concept is much wider and multifaceted. <br><br>  At the moment, content marketing is represented by such commonly used categories as: <br><br><ul><li>  Text content; </li><li>  Media content. </li></ul><br>  Briefly about them ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/106/03e/ada/10603eada2b141919a8f5b967a080011.png"></div><br><br><h4>  Text content </h4><br>  This category is best known and familiar to Internet users.  Without such content, virtually no resource will manage.  Even one that specializes in video or audio content.  After all, the text allows you to describe the meaning and purpose of the project, briefly describe the section, product.  In other words, the text allows you to awaken the primary interest of visitors to the resource. <br><br><h4>  Media content </h4><br>  This category is represented by audio, video, graphic content.  These include pictures, photos, videos, audio recordings that allow you to sell information, goods or services in a bright visual form.  Such content is particularly cost-effective to use for online stores, reviews, otzovikov. <br><br>  This type of content is in demand primarily because of human nature - reading huge amounts of text to many is elementary laziness, but to see a few vivid pictures, or fascinating video recordings - this is more interesting.  You can even listen to audio recordings without being ‚Äútied‚Äù to a computer, while driving or in the subway, at work or in nature. <br><br><h3>  Where to get content? </h3><br>  If you are a talented author, know how to work perfectly with graphic editors, there is an additional headset - then, of course, content sites can be created independently.  But are you really confident in your abilities and that there is enough time?  If there is any doubt, we still recommend using the work results of more experienced people creating unique content.  Considering that the source of content on the Internet is not difficult to find today, there is no need to waste your time writing texts. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fc3/08c/d78/fc308cd7872d46909f48b73a74e62ade.jpg"></div><br><br>  The best option is to order content for the site.  To order text content <a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/copywriting-services">copywriting exchange is</a> suitable.  To order media content you can also use freelance exchanges.  Moreover, today there are enough such resources and tens of thousands of freelancers are ready to translate your ideas and wishes into a quality product, at a reasonable price.  But it is more convenient to apply to specialized resources, where the specialists or their finished works are represented only in the profile you need.  To choose a copywriting exchange is based on its reputation. <br><br>  By the way, the need to fill the site with content in a foreign language can be used to further attract customers to any site.  Having the opportunity to choose a guest of the Russian version or, for example, English, will play a positive role for the successful promotion of the project. <br><br>  In more detail about how content types work, about useful properties, which one to choose, examples of resources for ordering different types, we wrote in <a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/blog/216">our</a> other <a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/blog/216">article</a> . <br><br>  Paying attention to filling the site with unique content, you can create the basis for its successful promotion.  But the most important thing - success depends not only on your determination and perseverance, but also on the willingness to cooperate.  And remember, who did not start, he never achieved anything. <br><br>  Subscribe to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/2polyglot/topics/">our blog</a> and be the first to know everything about freelancers in the language sphere, about working with them and about everything related to foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand writing texts. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309426/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309426/</a></p>
