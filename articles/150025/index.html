  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Comparison of client-banks of different eras</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My company has been holding a bank account with VTB24 for almost seven years.  At one time, VTB24 client bank was one of the best in the world, but, to tell the truth, it changed a bit during this time.  I like VTB24 and I would like it to be more convenient and friendly for an online user.  Two years ago, as a private individual, I started working with Bank24.ru, and then opened a bank account in it for a second legal entity.  Surprisingly, several of my friends, quite independently, made the same choice.  In this article, I would like to show the differences between the client-bank of two different eras (early 2000 and modern) and how much small improvements in usability can improve the impression of working with a web service. <br>  So, let's begin!  Along the way, I will evaluate the client-banks, based on my personal opinion. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><table><tbody><tr><th colspan="2">  <b>1. Perform key tasks</b> </th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">  <b>1.1.</b>  <b>Login</b> </th></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/35c/1b3/0af/35c1b30afc21bae57de9948ffd79c40c.png"></a> <br>  VTB24 welcomes with corporate colors and strict design, direct Moscow technical support number (which is not duplicated anywhere else in the client-bank) and news for 2009.  The only innovation is that before the entrance to the system was possible only with the help of a special program, now it works without it.  But only in Internet Explorer. <br></td><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/42d/cfb/5cd/42dcfb5cd79ebed9946801e1b81d1f31.png"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0fe/2ce/2b5/0fe2ce2b5cb491c350b603043e460910.png"></a> <br>  Bank24.ru meets no less corporate style, but with a much larger number of letters and contacts.  Pleasantly pleased with the service of ideas, available before entering the system, and many, many contacts at the bottom of the page.  I do not know how anyone, but if the phone is not 8-800 or it is not written that it is round-the-clock, it seems to me that people work from 9 to 18 Moscow time. <br>  In addition, from this page you can go to the main website of the bank !!! <br>  Unlike VTB24, Bank24.ru requires a special program that does not require installation.  However, the system can work not only in Internet Explorer. <br></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">  Bottom line: The VTB24 login page has not been looked at for a long time.  0: 1 </th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">  <b>1.2.</b>  <b>Enter confirmation SMS</b> <br></th></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dcf/643/b1b/dcf643b1b16fca4b78f171c0ee695950.png"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d7/f1a/e94/3d7f1ae9441e3e94fbd7577467a9b676.png"></a> <br>  In VTB24 SMS, in case of incorrect input, the code can be reused. <br>  After logging into the system every time there is a reminder, which is already routinely skipped. <br></td><td><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d1/494/e87/9d1494e87ed8b13d5c39dfdc4846a881.png"></a> <br>  At bank24.ru SMS confirmations are disposable.  If you make a mistake in entering the code, a new SMS comes with a new code. <br></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">  The bottom line: security at Bank24.ru above - SMS codes are disposable.  Will it save from trojans?  Unknown, therefore 1: 2 </th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">  <b>1.3.</b>  <b>start page</b> </th></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/283/e51/488/283e51488df6106ed7d767b61a4a0109.png"></a> <br><br>  VTB24‚Äôs harsh client-bank home page reminds us that we are not playing with money, but have come to work in a client-bank.  Somewhere far below are news for 2003 and information about exchange rates, as well as a list of new messages for me (they are not).  The only way to get somewhere from this page is to select any menu item on the left. <br>  Important - the page in length is the same as that of Bank24.ru, except that there is much less meaningful information there. <br>  The VTB24 PR department didn‚Äôt look at this page, probably never. <br></td><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/92d/746/3f7/92d7463f731dbeef144bc0d645f6e6c9.png"></a> <br>  Unlike VTB24, the start page of Bank24.ru devotes 80% of online stores in runet.  Here is the banner (the service is ‚ÄúClear‚Äù, and news (for people, not for machines), and all my recent activities, and even account balances !!! .. Quick access from each unit to the full list of payments, templates and other things . <br>  Very cool. <br></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">  I will not even comment.  Another score in favor of Bank24 and score 1: 3 </th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">  <b>1.4.</b>  <b>Look at the status of the account</b> <br></th></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b6e/963/e19/b6e963e190780a993176d9c9869363e8.png"></a> <br>  On this page you can see your accounts and balances.  It would seem that you can think of? </td><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/103/e0b/6b9/103e0b6b97dd00ad9dc9d594e16d208b.png"></a> <br>  It turns out you can! <br>  On the similar page Bank24, you can quickly perform all the necessary tasks: make a payment, get an extract, etc. </td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">  Strange, but on such a simple page one feels that VTB24 is lagging behind.  1: 4 <br></th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">  <b>1.5.</b>  <b>Look extracts</b> </th></tr><tr><td> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/39b/ed6/509/39bed65097d1e2a310b7293c72a76dcd.png"></a> <br>  Perhaps this is the page that I most dislike about VTB24.  In red, I selected checkboxes that need to be changed to get a normal statement containing all the fields.  Why you can not turn them on immediately, it is not clear. <br>  After setting the parameters, the statement takes on a normal form - it contains all the required fields, including the payer, as well as the totals by day: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f9/e0a/580/8f9e0a5808660583e36eaa6887c40d51.png"></a>

I will confirm - very cool and made for people.  No need to do any extra movements. <br></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">  Since I am subjective and this page is used by me as often as the page with payments, bank24.ru gets 3 points at once and the score is 1: 7 </th></tr><tr><th colspan="2">  <b>1.6.</b>  <b>We create and carry out payment</b> </th></tr><tr><td>  This is, in fact, the key moment of working with the client-bank.  And here at VTB24, in principle, everything is fine: <br>  First choose what we want to do - a new payment order or choose from a template <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6c4/877/9a7/6c48779a72614ad5dfcc2fece5369622.png"></a> <br>  Then fill in all the required fields. <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/844/7ef/9fd/8447ef9fd26d3722a2b55c4523ee489a.png"></a> <br>  And save the document <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba7/74c/28d/ba774c28d78990fa39a0f737de5267b0.png"></a> <br>  Next you need to go back to the list of documents (the ‚Äúsign‚Äù button is often buggy - if you have already signed a document, then when you click ‚Äúsign‚Äù when creating the next document, the system will pretend to sign it, but in fact will not sign it) and from there select document to sign <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/013/20c/8eb/01320c8eb39a25a6d6af22325272ae17.png"></a> <br>  Then check that everything is correct and sign the document: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c5a/1a9/14f/c5a1a914fd08386c589f0db38143072e.png"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6bc/f87/ecc/6bcf87ecc106039aa32bacb7365236ed.png"></a> <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/053/fdf/215/053fdf2152586fd4edcda0d206010cd5.png"></a> <br>  Then we return again to the documents and send the document to the bank. <br>  The technology is simple, with minimization of risks at each step and the ability to cancel a payment at each step. <br>  However, to send a document you need to fill out 8 forms.  The advantage is the ability to quickly create a lot of documents, and then one-click them all to sign and send. <br>  The important point is to inform that the payment is gone.  For 5 years of using the client bank of VTB24, I have never received SMS-notification of payment.  However, with the advent of warnings about Trojans and embezzlement of money, SMS began to arrive.  But only for payments in excess of some amount. <br></td><td>  At bank 24, everything looks alike.  However, there are nuances.  Let's see what's new in client banks for 10 years! <br>  Absolutely similarly from the menu action is chosen - to create a payment or select from a template. <br>  However, when creating a payment, there are a few pleasant moments (highlighted in red): <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4f7/297/d54/4f7297d540d1df8ad5d253aef553ad9d.png"></a> <br>  Here you can immediately see how much money in the account is available, and, plus, you get an absolutely cool thing - notify the recipient of the payment made!  Now you do not need to scan the payment and long and sad to send it. <br>  Further, the payment is signed and sent, without additional saving: <br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f15/172/4b3/f151724b3ab9babb7e74b4d9104a0558.png"></a> <br>  Each payment is confirmed by SMS-notification.  As in VTB24, you can save a payment template. <br>  Sending multiple payments can be done by signing only the first one - your signature is remembered for a while. <br>  In general, I can say that it has become more convenient.  The process itself has not changed much, but the pleasant little things are encouraging. <br></td></tr><tr><th colspan="2">  Bottom line: VTB24 is reliable and simple (1 point).  Bank24.ru - with new chips and additional services (2 points).  The final score is 2: 9. <br>  An additional aspect is that Bank24.ru sends an SMS for every sneeze.  VTB24 - no.  Well, oddly enough, payments from bank24.ru come faster. <br></th></tr></tbody></table><br>  Of course, client-bank services are not limited to these functions.  However, other possibilities are approximately comparable.  The main result is practically not yielding to the modern client-bank in opportunities, the old VTB24 loses to the new client-bank from Bank24.ru in usability, and, most importantly, in friendliness. <br><br>  PS I focus attention again - the article about the client-bank for legal entities. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150025/</a></p>
