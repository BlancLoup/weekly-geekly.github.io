  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hidden terms of inclusion in Google News - if Google remembered how he started</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago we made a sports news resource.  Naturally, we submitted applications for inclusion in <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/">Yandex.News</a> , <a href="http://news.google.ru/">Google news</a> and <a href="http://novoteka.ru/">Novotek</a> .  Yandex and Novotek responded immediately, Google proved much more interesting.  On the conditions of entry into Google News, open and not so, as well as a comparison of approaches with Yandex. News, further in the topic. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  We are all under the cap at Muller </h1><br>  So, to submit an application to Google News, there is a <a href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/request.py%3Fcontact_type%3Dsuggest_content%26hl%3Dru">special form</a> .  No contact numbers, email or real addresses for <s>the evil empire of</s> Google, apparently, does not exist in principle.  If you found ‚Äúsecret Google news of the <strong>Internet</strong> ‚Äù in the form <strong>source-suggestions@google.com</strong> and wrote to it directly - do not be under a delusion: I personally didn‚Äôt respond directly to me directly.  The entry conditions required for execution seem to be listed here: <a href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/answer.py%3Fanswer%3D40787%26hl%3Dru">www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/answer.py?answer=40787&amp;hl=ru</a> - I really liked the ‚Äúinformational content‚Äù. <br><br>  In the form for filling there is one, very remarkable (optional field) "List of authors and publishers on your site" - with this "optional field" there will be a funny story. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      After submitting the application on the specified form, you automatically receive a letter in the mail of the following content: <br><blockquote>  Thank you for the information provided.  We are working to ensure that you get answers in your own language, but at the moment we can only answer in English.  We apologize for any inconvenience caused. <br><br>  To help us handle a large number of such requests, we ask you to familiarize yourself with the recommendations below and respond to this message if the materials you provide meet our requirements. <br><br>  Usually in Google News we include materials that: - belong to the content provider; <br>  - are not used by the provider solely for self-promotion; <br>  - prepared and maintained by a transparent organization in which several writers and editors work. <br><br>  Let us know if your materials meet these requirements.  As soon as we get an answer, we‚Äôll be happy to review your site for adding it to Google News.  While we strive to include as many news content providers as possible, please note that we do not guarantee the inclusion of your content in Google News.  Since our support resources are currently not available in your native language, it may take several weeks or months to review your request. <br><br>  Meanwhile, we also offer you to familiarize yourself with our technical requirements. <br><br>  If you add a regular site, check out our technical requirements on the following page: <br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/topic.py%3Ftopic%3D11665">www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/topic.py?topic=11665</a> . <br><br>  If you‚Äôre adding a mobile site, see our help resources at <a href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/answer.py%3Fanswer%3D148663">www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/answer.py?answer=148663</a> . <br><br>  If you're adding a YouTube channel, check out our help resources at <a href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/answer.py%3Fanswer%3D93985">www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/answer.py?answer=93985</a> . <br><br>  Thanks for helping us improve Google News. <br><br>  Best wishes, <br>  google team </blockquote><br><br>  The situation, why not give this link even when filling out the form, so that you can immediately get acquainted with the requirements is not clear at all.  For example, in Yandex.News, references to requirements are published on the page describing the connection to the system.  They are also duplicated in the mail, but only <strong>if Yandex is interested in including you in the Ya.Novosti</strong> .  In addition, Yandex does not require changing the URL structure of the site ... <br><br>  <em>I do not understand anything in sausage cuts, but Google makes me run a number of those.</em>  <em>requirements even before the moment when they, in principle, give their opinion whether they will cooperate or not.</em> <br><br><h1>  By the way, about those.  requirements </h1><br>  We tried to connect a regular site, so we are only talking about the requirements set out on the first link from a letter from Google. <br>  Comparing requests from Google and Yandex (Yandex‚Äôs requirements are <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/cooperation.html">published here</a> ): <br><ul><li>  Yandex‚Äôs main demand is a RSS 2.0 full-text stream with its own specifics. </li><li>  Google's requirements are in addition to the RSS feed, a <a href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/topic.py%3Ftopic%3D11665">number of requirements for the URL structure of the site</a> ‚Äî for example: <ul><li>  <a href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26answer%3D93989">at least 3-digit unique number in the URL, not like a year</a> - farewell index - we decided simply: url a line like: ... "100" .id_ news </li><li> <a href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/answer.py%3Fhl%3Dru%26answer%3D93989">A special URL format for forums and comments</a> ‚Äî especially nice for CMS ‚Äî while it was recommended to rewrite URL addresses, it was impossible to advise, for example, to resolve the issue via robots.txt: <br> <code>User-agent: Googlebot-News <br> Disallow: */comments-page-* <br></code> </li></ul></li></ul><br><br><h1>  Process </h1><br>  So, on April 1 (this is not a joke) they launched the site, filled it with initial news (transferred the most interesting publications from their own newspaper, gave the latest news), started working for the resource, and about 10 numbers sent requests to Novotek (by mail info @ novoteka.ru), Yandex (by mail info@news.yandex.ru) and Google (via the <a href="http://www.google.com/support/news_pub/bin/request.py%3Fcontact_type%3Dsuggest_content%26hl%3Dru">form</a> ): <br><br><h2>  Yandex Way </h2><br><br>  The news came almost immediately: the content manager Anastasia K. answered us: (it‚Äôs not literally given - common sense) <blockquote>  Hello, at the moment the perspective of your resource is not clear - we suggest you contact us on this issue again, for example, after 2 months ... </blockquote><br>  In principle, quite adequate and positive response.  I liked the fact that a person presents himself by his first name, he clearly explained his position ... <br>  After another 1.5 months, we repeated our request (of course, that the resource worked, interesting materials appeared), and received an affirmative answer: <br><br><blockquote>  % Name% hello! <br>  Thank you for your attention to the Yandex.News service. <br>  (http://news.yandex.ru/).  General information about the affiliate program can be <br>  get on the page <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/cooperation.html">news.yandex.ru/cooperation.html</a> <br>  ... <br>  You can start the procedure for connecting to Yandex.News immediately after <br>  receive this letter ... <br></blockquote><br>  Further, the requirement to create and report a Yandex account login, a number of extracts and explanations on the rules of work, some clarifications, reminders about the rules for compiling the RSS export stream, and all such technical requirements. <br><br><h2>  Novoteka Way </h2><br>  There was an amusing correspondence: <br>  Request: <br><blockquote>  Dear colleagues, as a developer of a sports resource ... that covers exclusively sporting events ... of the region, I would like to know about the possibility of including our resource in the aggregation of Novoteka news. <br></blockquote><br>  Answer: <br><blockquote>  Hello,% Name%. <br>  For collaboration, you need an RSS feed with full texts. <br>  Full texts of news can be in the tags &lt;full-text&gt;, &lt;novoteka: full-text&gt;, <br>  &lt;yandex: full-text&gt; or, in extreme cases,. <br>  Respectfully, <br>  Irina G. <br><br>  Request: <blockquote>  Is this type of tape suitable?  % URL export for Yandex% </blockquote><br>  Answer: <br><blockquote>  Hello,% Name%. <br>  Your RSS feed is connected -% URL% <br>  Respectfully, <br>  Irina G. </blockquote><br>  24 hours to connect - bravo!  At least in one place on this planet they were able to defeat the bureaucracy ... <br><br><h2>  Google: Eh, road, dust and fog ... </h2><br>  Cold, anxiety, yes steppe weeds: <br><ul><li>  The answer to our first request through a special form has not yet come (in principle, not so much time has passed since April 10, yeah ...) </li><li>  Attempting to write directly to ‚ÄúGoogle News email‚Äù had the same results (‚ÄúDon't chat!‚Äù?) </li><li>  The third attempt, through the same ill-fated form, was taken on June 26: filled out, received an email, confirmed compliance with the requirements. </li></ul><br><br>  Finally, we waited for an answer (June 29): <br><br><blockquote>  Hello,% Name%! <br><br>  Thank you for your message. <br><br>  We‚Äôve reviewed your site but aren‚Äôt yet able to include it in Google News.  Currently, we only include articles from sources that can be classified as news organizations, i.e.  sources with several authors and editors, organization information, and a list of contact numbers and / or addresses.  After reviewing your site, we could not find information that would characterize you as an organization. <br><br>  Please note that we also do not include sites that are created and maintained by one person.  Thank you for taking the time to write to us.  We will note your site to revise it if our requirements change. <br><br>  Thank you for your interest in Google News. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Google Team <br></blockquote><br><br>  Undoubtedly, any organization has the right to establish its own rules according to which they will work - that is their right. <br><br>  The question is different: <br><ul><li>  Why are the requirements for which this organization works are not indicated <strong>anywhere</strong> ? </li><li>  Why to get an answer you need to hammer, like a woodpecker on concrete? </li><li>  Why isn't the <em>‚ÄúList of authors and publishers on your site‚Äù</em> field listed as required in the request form for Google News? </li><li>  Why in the form for the request there are no conditions for specifying Jur.  the person, the parameters of the size of the secretary, the address of the office and the list of its constantly inhabiting "plankton"? </li><li>  Why was it necessary to introduce hidden, nowhere else announced conditions for cooperation? </li><li>  Could Sergey Brin himself start cooperating with his current Google at the beginning of his journey? </li></ul><br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1><br>  Each makes its own conclusions.  My IMHO is: <br><ol><li>  Yandex and Novotek need partners with real-time news, Google - ‚Äúfor the suit to sit‚Äù </li><li>  Once again, ‚Äúknock on Google‚Äù is never superfluous </li><li>  Google should not expect speed </li><li>  The latest condition from Google does not happen </li><li>  The rules of etiquette (sign letters of the form "Last Name-First" - as they do, for example: Yandex, Microsoft) are not followed by Google, limiting themselves to the faceless "Google Team" </li></ol><br><br><h2>  UDP: Address of the resource itself </h2><br><br>  Since the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/98169/">opinion</a> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/gigaset88/" class="user_link">gigaset88</a> was supported by a number of votes, publish the address of our resource: <br>  <a href="http://kubsport.ru/">Kuban sport.RU</a> is a resource about professional and amateur sports in Krasnodar Region.  Included in <a href="http://news.yandex.ru/smi/kubsport">Yandex.News</a> and <a href="http://novoteka.ru/sid%3F100383">Novotek</a> .
