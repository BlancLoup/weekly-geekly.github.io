They, by the way, can be left in the comments. <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/875/37f/13f87537fb23a7443a7c93befdbcbd44.jpg" align="left"><br>  Apparently, reassured by the assurances of reputable private detective Stephen Rambam ( <a href="http://www.universalsubtitles.org/ru/videos/YSEgofMg2wgv/ru/80608/">‚ÄúNo Private Life, Humble‚Äù</a> ), everyone desperately rushed to check in.

The authors decided to follow the simplest way: to transfer the communication of the first and second to the Internet messenger. <br>  All that is required of them is to install the program, indicate the applications of interest and remain online.  The service works on the principle of sending applications to all users who subscribe to them (taking into account interests and territorial requirements, receiving answers on the application and establishing online correspondence with them).  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/trade-chat/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c30/cd3/270/c30cd3270dc1a677d7eaca68d46b7f6a.png" align="left"><br>  All convenient online stores are equally comfortable, all inconvenient online stores are inconvenient in their own way.  <a href="http://redhelper.ru/">RedHelper is</a> designed to help both. <br>  The system allows you to communicate with visitors directly during online shopping and give them advice on the nuances associated with the purchase.  According to the authors of the service, this increases the conversion of visitors to buyers by 15-40%.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/online-consultant/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/online-consultant/"><br></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e9a/75f/954/e9a75f9545dc69da1d67b8f5c747d79b.png" align="left">  Probably everyone who is reading this text now knows what Bonk is.  Bonk is the author of an English textbook, through which, probably, 90% of those who learned English in the 90s passed through Russia. <br>  Speech, vocabulary, grammar, spelling and subtleties of language - this is what the study of language is primarily associated with the traditional method, ‚Äúaccording to Bonku‚Äù (by the way, Bonk is a woman, Natalia Bonk).  The authors of the project <a href="http://smart-bay.ru/about/project/">Smart-Bay.ru</a> believe that this is far from the only method of learning a language.

At Wanted.VC, such projects appeared with an impressive regularity ( <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/d1-81-d0-ba-d0-b8-d0-b4-d0-ba-d0-b8-d0-b4-d0-bb-d1-8f-d0-bc-d0-b5-d1-81-d1-82-d0-bd-d1-8b-d1-85/">one</a> , <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/luxury-for-the-middle/">two</a> , <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/the-whole-world/">three</a> , <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/products-for-vip-coupons/">four</a> ), so for those who are especially interested, it will be easy to get a complete picture of such services. <br>  <a href="http://www.appiny.ru/">Appiny</a> authors <a href="http://www.appiny.ru/">understood</a> everything correctly.

According to the first value, a user who is eager to get something from the catalog of prizes runs no risk (that is, absolutely nothing).  The second value is for advertisers: by providing their products for the site‚Äôs raffle, they don‚Äôt risk to lose out on a large-scale advertising campaign, but gradually invest in a small but guaranteed target audience.  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/riskless-investment/">+++</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/850/fe8/c40/850fe8c40c8bc35a10836ba859c4233e.jpg" align="left">  ‚ÄúOver the past 6 years, I changed 7 countries of residence and noticed that in each country Russians are drawn to each other.  In each country, as a rule, there are 2-3 forums for Russians, where some systematic, sorted communication takes place. <br>  However, in no country is there a simple easy way to make new friends in a new place.  So I thought - and it would be interesting to just go somewhere and chat with random Russians - to discuss today's events in Paris or Stockholm, for example. <br>  Despite travel experience and fluent English, I am sometimes curious to hear the opinion of a compatriot.  Therefore, I am registered in more than ten different forums for expatriates. ‚Äù <br>  In order to somehow indulge his unquenchable need for communication with two-dimensional compatriots, Denis Mysenko, who owns the quote, came up with <a href="http://www.radarspeak.com/">RadarSpeak</a> .  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/among-their-own/">+++</a> <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/among-their-own/"><br><br></a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6bd/c00/1ff/6bdc001ffc266c87d6c6d6e7da1c2d9e.jpg" align="left">  The audience of the <a href="http://javafx.me/mrf/">mobiRef</a> service are adherents of online games who buy their artifacts more often than clothes for real life. <br>  The essence of the project is to facilitate the already difficult life of gamers, turning the SMS-payment of artifacts from the tedious exchange of codes into the most simplified mechanism, reminiscent of online shopping. <br>  Such services already exist, but are created only for smartphones (iPhone, Android, Windows), while <a href="http://javafx.me/mrf/">mobiRef</a> can also work on regular cell phones (of which there are still twice as many as smartphones).  <a href="http://wanted.vc/blog/frequent-artefacts/">+++</a> <br></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126816/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126816/</a></p>
