  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Thinking out loud about the humanoid AI</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have long dreamed that the computer was a smart assistant.  So that he could describe the problem in words, and he carried it out - as in many plots.  I spoke with Alice, but you yourself understand that she is far from the goal.  Probably because they do not know how to think, experience emotions, and so on - a standard set of AI problems.  And I got an idea how to solve this problem, and I want to tell you about it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Idea </h5><br>  The idea is to grow the AI, as a small child, and make it as detailed as possible.  The machine does not understand a person simply because from its ‚Äúpoint of view‚Äù everything ‚Äúlooks‚Äù completely different - on the example of Alice, her world is a set of characters, incoming and outgoing flows. <br>  I propose to show the computer the world of man - in the most similar light.  So that he can see, hear, touch, maybe even sniff.  To give him a human body, but not a physical one - it will be too expensive and difficult, but modeled. <br><br><h5>  Engine </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/58b5b30b/a23791ab/af4d29f6/46fd2501.jpg"><br>  Imagine a toy, like Sims (I did not play myself, judging by the screenshots), in which the AI ‚Äã‚Äãcontrols one body.  I do not think that there is a need to describe this body in great detail - but some nuances are important.  For example, a vision: at the entrance of the AI, to submit pictures from two eyes (not the player‚Äôs eye, the ‚Äúcamera‚Äù, but the body‚Äôs eye, that is, the picture that you would see if you were in its place) in order <i>to</i> get a three-dimensional view.  A certain minimum of sensors from the hands, feet, and other parts of the body - so that he could feel if he hits the back of his head, or understand when he clutched his glass with his fingers so as not to squeeze his fingers further and break it.  On the way out, as you already understood, control of various muscles - arms and legs, eyes (to simplify the neural network, you can do a lower image resolution, but add the possibility of ‚Äúzoom‚Äù), and so on. <br>  Immediately make a reservation about the broken glass - I do not claim that the physics of destruction is a necessity in this model, but I believe that its presence will allow the computer to better understand a person. <br><br><h5>  Birth </h5><br>  Of course, if you take it like this and immerse the neural network in such a body, the result will be zero.  Too much chaotic data, and one generation will not play any role here.  Therefore, an evolution is necessary - to begin with, at least teach the ‚Äúperson‚Äù to eat (one of the sensors will be the sensor of hunger, the AI ‚Äã‚Äãwill receive data from it, but initially will not know how to react to it).  I think many generations will die until they learn to eat (in this period, generations will have to be reproduced manually).  Then you need to teach at least a little to own your body - for example, move to food (at least crawling).  I think that after such ‚Äúprimitives‚Äù, we will get a creature that looks like a baby.  It must have basic needs - food, comfort, reproduction.  And this baby should be brought up further - to teach him to walk, to talk.  Give it to some kind of kindergarten, then - school.  More and more to acquaint him with the human world.  The result is close, now what?

    <h5>  "Schoolboy" </h5><br>  When you can communicate with him at the level of a student, you can take the body from him and leave the mind.  The inputs and outputs of an AI can be connected to other things ‚Äî return it to the same streams of characters so that it can read books and chat.  Give him the choice of what will serve him with his eyes - be it a movie, or a webcam of your laptop.  In general, after the ‚Äúschool‚Äù of the ‚Äúperson‚Äù it is already possible to form the necessary result.  At the ‚Äúschoolchild‚Äù level, a computer must understand the person himself, and not just his speech. <br><br><h5>  Result? </h5><br>  I believe that in this way it will be possible to ‚Äúteach‚Äù a computer to experience emotions.  And the more detailed the modeled world will be, the more the result will be like a person.  Of course, one can give not a human body, and not human needs ‚Äî say, instead of food ‚Äî the need to grow a tree, but instead of the conditions of one‚Äôs own comfort, the comfort of a neighbor.  As a result, there will be some kind of ‚Äúalien‚Äù - it will be difficult for him to understand us, if at all possible.  But if you leave the human communication skill - you can communicate. <br><br><h5>  Detail </h5><br>  Of course, the need to eat arose probably even before the same monkey was formed, if you believe that all life came from single-celled.  You can start modeling with single-celled ones - the result will be better (the problem of nutrition, comfort and reproduction will be sewn in the ‚Äúnatural‚Äù way), but it will take much longer and does not guarantee that it will look like a person (hello UFO). <br><br><h5>  Afterword </h5><br>  These are the thoughts out loud.  I myself will not draw such a project, therefore I give the idea to you.  Perhaps among you there are those who will catch fire with this idea and will assemble a team for its implementation.  Maybe someone will even see financial potential in this project.  Of course, the result will not come in a week, and not in a month - it can take years to raise.  But the ‚Äústudent‚Äù can be saved and used as a base for ‚Äúdescendants‚Äù. <br><br>  If you have questions, I am ready to share my thoughts on this topic. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/131799/">https://habr.com/ru/post/131799/</a></p>
