Now ASUS has announced another subnotebook series Eee PC, this is the fifth in this series (in addition to 700, 701, 900 and 901).  And, as usual, ASUS jumps even higher in the competition for portability and power. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ASUS Eee PC 1000 is equipped with a 10 inch display and a fairly convenient keyboard, and all this pleasure will be sold for the price of only $ 699.  In addition to a convenient keyboard and an extended display, this laptop has a 40 GB SSD drive (the largest among all subnotebooks) and Xandros Linux, which contains much more pre-installed applications that make it faster and more economical. <br><br>  Unlike the older version of the Eee PC, the 1000 model has a more pleasant appearance - a shiny black surface with the Eee PC emblem, there are also options for coloring in silver-gray and black with silver case.  Unlike the 901 model, the 1000 has a surface that is resistant to contamination.

      With its 10 inch screen, the Eee PC 1000 is the largest subnotebook in existence.  Also, the Eee PC 1000 has become a bit heavier than its counterparts, weighing ~ 1.1 kg. <br>  In addition, a 1.3 megapixel webcam will be included with this subnotebook. <br>  The Eee PC is equipped with Dolby Surround stereo speakers.  The sound has become deeper and stronger. <br><br>  ASUS engineers have greatly improved the convenience of the keyboard, although they did not correct many of the flaws: the right shift is still above the button to the right, so you can miss. <br>  Unlike other Eee PCs, the Eee PC 1000 has a wider and more convenient touchpad.  According to ASUS, it supports multitouch technology, although out of the box it does not work. <br><br>  Like the 901 and 1000H, the four buttons above the Eee PC 1000 keyboard perform different functions: the first one turns off the monitor, the second one changes the screen resolution, the third one Super Hybrid Engine switches between different power saving modes, the fourth one is user defined. <br>  Buttons for switching resolution and power consumption modes are the most interesting: <br>  - The resolution switches between: 800 x 600, 1024 x 600 (default), 1024 x 768 (makes the screen higher than the diagonal allows), and 1024 x 600 compresses the image so that everything fits on one screen. <br>  - Power management mode allows you to quickly switch between power saving mode (1.2-GHz), automatic power saving (1.2-GHz, default), high-performance (1.6-GHz), and super performance (1.8-GHz).  Unfortunately, there were no significant differences in performance, so you can stay on energy-saving. <br><br>  ASUS wisely decided that there was nothing to fix in the Xandros user interface, fully concentrating on bundling applications to make a computer with what it needs. <br>  The menu is divided into 6 parts: Internet, Work, Study, Games, Settings and Preferences.  The package includes Pidgin, Skype, StarOffice, Thunderbird, Wikipedia and quick links to the most popular Web email services. <br>  Also added to the Google Picasa package for organizing and uploading photos to the network, and the ASUS DVD player. The Chinese learning program is also included;) New Eee Connect applications allow users to connect to another Eee PC remotely. <br><br>  40 Gigabyte solid-state drive on the Eee PC 1000 combines high speed and security (due to the absence of moving parts) with a much larger volume, in contrast to the 10-gigabyte and 12 gigabyte in other models.  It is divided into 2 parts of 20 GB each volume.  The system boot speed has increased - 28 seconds, against 40 for the Eee PC 1000H, so Linux boots much faster than Microsoft OSes. <br><br>  If someone lacks 40 Gb, ASUS, along with a laptop, provides 20 Gb of free space on YoStore.  The link to YoStore is located on the Internet tab and requires registration with a username and password.  After you register, YoStorage will be mounted as a separate section.  To connect to YoStore, just download their client and log in, there were no special problems with the connection. <br><br>  1.6 Ghz processor and 1 Gb RAM allow for solid performance, pre-installed programs like StarOffice Writer open very quickly, and there are no slowdowns while making video calls with Skype or listening to music through Slacker. <br><br>  The Eee PC 1000 provides a fairly strong connection level, around 80% within a 15 meter radius from the router, although we noticed a couple of dropped connections.  Pages load quickly NYTimes.com loaded in just 2 seconds, and streaming video from YouTube and Hulu.com came with minimal delays and interruptions.  Bluetooth is also available and allows you to communicate, for example with the Eee PC 901. <br><br>  Subnotebooks, decorated with Atom processors, make it possible not to think much about charging the battery.  The Eee PC 1000 with its 6 cell battery runs with Wi-Fi on for 5 hours and 12 minutes, which is 44 minutes longer than 1000H and almost as much as MSI Wind (5:13). <br><br>  Specifications: <br>  <strong>Processor:</strong> 1.6Ghz <br>  <strong>RAM:</strong> 1Gb installed + 1Gb upgrade option. <br>  <strong>HDD:</strong> 40Gb SSD <br>  <strong>Display Size:</strong> 10 " <br>  <strong>Screen resolution:</strong> 1024x600 <br>  <strong>Video Card:</strong> Intel Graphics Media Accelerator <br>  <strong>Video Memory:</strong> Out of RAM <br>  <strong>Wi-Fi:</strong> 802.11 b / g / n <br>  <strong>Bluetooth:</strong> 1.0 <br>  <strong>OS:</strong> Xandros <br>  3 USB, Ethernet, headphone, microphone and VGA input. <br>  <strong>Size:</strong> 27x19x4 cm. <br><br>  This is a translation of the article from the site <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/review/laptops/asus-eee-pc-1000-linux.aspx">LAPTOPMAG.COM</a> <br>  Crosspost translation <a href="http://librarian.spb.ru/2008/08/06/anonsirovan-asus-eeepc-1000/">from my blog</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31686/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31686/</a></p>
