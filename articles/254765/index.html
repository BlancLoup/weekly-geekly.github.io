The main equipment <b>stock</b> consists of the Russian <b>ELAR</b> scanners <b>PlanScan A2B</b> scanners and the German <b>Zeutschel OS 12000</b> and <b>Book2Net V-Scan Cobra</b> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/11141149_10204216458917204_6649967305751091425_n.jpg?oh=94ee4ba24d8490e082bd81e6174132d7&amp;oe=55A780F8" alt="image"><br><br>  Paper materials entering the department - books and magazines are sorted and put into separate groups.  Books with a thin spine are sent to PlanScan, most of the thick materials are scanned with Zeutschel.  Book2Net Cobra, is used less often, mainly when digitizing large-format books with a tight binding.  Scanning is performed using clamping glass, so a separate room is equipped to eliminate the illumination without direct lighting from above.  Scanners are connected to an external workstation with pre-installed proprietary software for each model, which allows you to split the received electronic images of book spreads into separate pages and crop the image by format.  Further copies are sent to the network storage for further professional processing in the Adobe Photoshop graphic editor.

      The working day of the scan operator is eight hours, an approximate plan of about a thousand sheets.  Despite the similar characteristics and approximately equal to the average performance of scanners, there are a number of structural and functional differences that affect the performance and the calculation of the cost of ownership in budgeting.  Which model is the most reliable and functionally balanced?  The answer to this question can be given by an objective analysis, including the practical and theoretical parts of the comparison used in the RSL of book scanners. <br><br>  The review of the RSL scanning equipment will begin with a review of the main technical characteristics. <br><br><h2>  The stated specifications </h2> <br>  <b>ELAR PlanScan A2B</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc3/2ae/2b1/fc32ae2b1e26d252a72d2ed0fad82253.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Scanner type</b> - planetary.

Work in semi-automatic and manual mode <br>  <b>Manufacturer</b> - Microbox, Germany <br><br>  In the RSL, Book2Net is used in particular cases for scanning books of originals uncharacteristic to the general flow of books - editions with a nonstandard, hard-to-open binding. <br><br>  Typically, equipment manufacturers indicate the maximum possible characteristics of their systems, which are achievable only under reference operating conditions.  Professional book scanners are no exception.  As a rule, the functionality of such devices is quite extensive, but the parameters for solving the main tasks - digitizing book materials come to the fore.  When working with books, first of all, the indicators of the scanning system and the suitability of the structural elements of the scanner to the originals of various formats and quality are important.  If reliability and convenience of work is determined during direct use, then it is possible to identify the values ‚Äã‚Äãof optical resolution, features of the illuminators, and assess the quality of electronic copies using comprehensive testing equipment.  Below is a description of the tests performed. <br><br><h2>  Comparative Testing </h2><br><h3>  1. Depth of field </h3><br>  The survey was carried out with the digitization parameters adopted in the work of the Department of Scanning of the RSL: 300 dpi, color TIFF.  Depth of field is the range of distances in which objects are perceived as sharp.  The sharpness of the image changes gradually, depending on the focusing distance.  If the deterioration of the image becomes visually noticeable, then it is considered to have gone beyond the depth of field and is unacceptable for further use.  In planetary scanners, the depth of field is the most important parameter, the higher its value, the greater the likelihood of correct scanning of large and thick objects, originals with a difference in thickness or significant page bends. <br><br>  For testing, a volume object with a height of 9 cm and two test objects, the TO-2A object, according to GOST 13.1.701, consisting of pairs of dark and light parallel lines with different spatial frequency were used.  The volumetric object was placed next to the test object.  On top of the subject laid out the second test - the object.  The focusing distance during scanning varied with respect to each test object by an amount equal to the height of the volume object, hence the sharpness fluctuations in the image. <br><br>  <b>Zeutschel OS 12000</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c69/e7a/413/c69e7a41326c51af553501852301b9e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As we can see, there is a deterioration in the sharpness of the upper test object.  But it is worth noting that the depth of field claimed by the manufacturer for Zeutschel OS 12000 is 5 cm, so the test result can be considered acceptable.  Thanks to the floating cradle, Zeutschel is able to confidently cope with the digitization of books up to 10 cm thick. <br><br>  <b>ELAR PlanScan A2B</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6a5/ee4/20e/6a5ee420eb0f50bdbc9b2c44530740eb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On PlanScan results are better.  The top test is a much sharper object than on Zeutschel.  The depth of field stated by the manufacturer is 15 cm fully practiced when digitizing.  PlanScan performs our tests with a margin.  We can recommend it for digitizing complex books with curved pages and height differences. <br><br>  Or bulky items ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a8c/570/78d/a8c57078d110efa55af3adbef5d6a147.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Book2Net V-Scan Cobra did not participate in this test due to the design features of the book cradle.  We will believe the manufacturer, which claims a depth of field of 12.5 cm. Moreover, the scanner copes well with thick books.  But the only possible V - shaped digitization mode, of course, imposes restrictions on the use of the scanner. <br><br><h3>  2. Optical resolution </h3><br>  A visual assessment of the optical resolution was performed by scanning the test - objects TO-2A GOST 13.1.701.  In the department of scanning of the RSL, digitization is carried out with a resolution of 300 dpi, therefore the equipment must ensure the readability of the limiting group with the spatial frequency of the 3.6 test-object lines of the resolution.  A group of elements is considered readable if the white and black lines do not merge along the entire length. <br><br>  <b>Zeutschel OS 12000</b> <br><br><img src="https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xtf1/v/t1.0-9/11149122_10204216073307564_9099838835391905384_n.jpg?oh=932c3d21bdec9beb42ececf6fa35501c&amp;oe=55972D3F" alt="image"><br><br>  Zeutschel OS 12000 provides readability of a group of lines at a value of 3.6, which corresponds to a real optical resolution of 300 dpi at the maximum format.  In the following ascending values, aberrations and loss of sharpness begin to appear. <br><br>  <b>Book2Net V-Scan Cobra</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d41/4f0/e76/d414f0e7639b3fc1f5a94e96287a5b7d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Book2Net also coped with this test, a group of lines by the value of 3.6 is readable, although color aberrations are present horizontally.  Further values ‚Äã‚Äãdeteriorate like Zeutschel. <br><br>  <b>ELAR PlanScan A2B</b> <br><br><img src="https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xft1/v/t1.0-9/11116496_10204216071027507_4540761001953635153_n.jpg?oh=acdfbd8045b8911689a6c54c0c8e04e3&amp;oe=55AF0A2D" alt="image"><br><br>  On PlanScan A2B, the test - object values ‚Äã‚Äãare the most contrasting and sharp among all the survey representatives.  Groups of lines are well read up to the value of 5.6. <br><br><h3>  3. Software evaluation of optical resolution </h3><br>  Images of test targets taken with a resolution of 300 dpi were loaded into specialized software, in which, using the built-in algorithms, the system translated visual indicators into digital ones and lined graphical diagrams with sampling of key data. <br><br>  <b>Zeutschel OS 12000</b> <br><br><img src="https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xaf1/v/t1.0-9/10418525_10204216126028882_7509763358278962885_n.jpg?oh=0e16c989a5e3d0d7c640f5b002466e4b&amp;oe=55AF63C8" alt="image"><br><br>  From the testimony of the system, it follows that the quality of Zeutschel OS 12000 images in program recalculation corresponds to a value of 298.5 ppi (pixels per inch) with the presence of significant horizontal aberrations (62%), i.e. deviations of the beam in the beam structure emanating from the scanner optical system from the direction given in the mathematical model of an ideal optical system.  The presence of aberrations reduces image clarity, which we observed when visually assessing the optical resolution by scanning test objects. <br><br>  <b>Book2Net V-Scan Cobra</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e7a/266/8a5/e7a2668a59b52066ef18a2888357c925.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The quality of Book2Net images in program recalculation corresponds to a value of 295.6 ppi (pixels per inch) with permissible aberrations, both vertically and horizontally.  The overall clarity of images from Book2Net is at a high enough level. <br><br>  <b>ELAR PlanScan A2B</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cb/769/102/4cb7691026657a6707b03f008e2f26df.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  PlanSkan has the highest pixel concentration per inch of 301.7 ppi, which improves image detail.  But there is a slight deviation of the rays horizontally, which, in fairness, does not constitute a significant violation of the homocentricity of the rays emerging from the optical system and having virtually no effect on the clarity of the images. <br><br><h3>  4. Check color reproduction </h3><br>  A color target was scanned, including reference standard colors of the highest quality.  According to the correspondence of the values ‚Äã‚Äãobtained as a result of scanning, it is possible to judge the quality of the color rendition of the equipment.  Testing was performed without additional calibration of scanners. <br><br>  <b>Zeutschel OS 12000</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc0/68e/7e1/bc068e7e1a5cbac2ec252090029555e6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Book2Net V-Scan Cobra</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/968/e2f/ec4/968e2fec40db31fe93d26d3ffb7ea952.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>ELAR PlanScan A2B</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c9/aa7/96b/6c9aa796b11eca62463f95043323818d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the basis of the images obtained, the Book2Net V-Scan Cobra lacks color rendering with redundant shades of red, Zeutschel and PlanScan scanners are at an equally good level.  It is worth noting that the results of PlanScan and Zeutschel may be higher after the color calibration. <br><br><h3>  5. Effects of lighting </h3><br>  Lighting is the most important component of the digitization process.  All models presented built-in LED illuminators without harmful infrared and ultraviolet radiation.  In the work of standard lighting, we were primarily interested in the formation of flare in the spine zone when scanning glossy originals and the manifestation of glare in the case of digitizing embossed or wrinkled pages. <br><br>  <b>Zeutschel OS 12000</b> <br><br><img src="https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/11136651_10204216071387516_8025489203058836632_n.jpg?oh=b5001837d8cd4adbc1fc2b2cbd3ae4e9&amp;oe=55E4C47C" alt="image"><br><br>  When scanning a glossy book on Zeutschel, there is no flare in the spine area. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e7/c5e/16b/5e7c5e16bab54a305cd29aa17c41fb9e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Glare when scanning a crumpled page in the normal range. <br><br>  <b>Book2Net V-Scan Cobra</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f4c/f04/276/f4cf04276b421d5c2b72bc155d8738af.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Book2Net also lacks illumination in the spine of the book, but a strip of shadow appears in the binding area, resulting from the use of a V-shaped pressure glass.  That, however, does not affect the readability of the text. <br><br><img src="https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpa1/v/t1.0-9/11136630_10204216073227562_8244074212899772287_n.jpg?oh=77b6fcd271d1be7a449f117308bc2ac3&amp;oe=55AB35F2" alt="image"><br><br>  When scanning the crumpled page, Book2Net does not cope with the formation of glare, the results are significantly lower than normal. <br><br>  <b>ELAR PlanScan A2B</b> <br><br><img src="https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xpf1/v/t1.0-9/11137125_10204216073067558_4852972782215422375_n.jpg?oh=c17f72390823bbc931383206ea0094de&amp;oe=55AE38C1" alt="image"><br><br>  PlanScan performs a good digitization of a glossy book, there is no illumination in the spine.  Since a V-shaped glass is used, a similar Book2Net strip appears in the binding area.  When cropping the spread and saving each page to a separate file, this phenomenon is not essential. <br><br><img src="https://scontent-fra.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-xfa1/v/t1.0-9/11152700_10204216073587571_1802120525369027211_n.jpg?oh=49d13433f6b64c43b8c159a0f81003a3&amp;oe=5599A5A6" alt="image"><br><br>  Glare when scanning a crumpled page on PlanScan, as well as Zeutschel are within normal limits. <br><br>  The above calculations of the comparative tests show the basic capabilities of scanners in the process of creating electronic copies of library collections, expressed in the characteristics of optical resolution, the ability to scan complex originals - glossy, thick, defective materials, while maintaining the high quality of the images.  The tested models demonstrated good results of complex testing, scanners correspond to the parameters of resolution, depth of field and lighting systems declared by manufacturers.  The book specificity of the equipment is confirmed by the results of practical tests.  Along with this, the features of everyday use are not fully disclosed, there are no data on the reliability of mechanical components and design.  Therefore, a comprehensive review of complex technical devices considers their characteristics as a general indicator of the hardware-software and functional part, which is based on the opinion of direct users, the number of calls to the service, and the quality of warranty service.  From this point of view, the most important component is the recall of functional representatives - employees of the RSL scanning department. <br><br>  Larisa Anatolievna Pokutnyaya (head of the Russian State Library of New Arrivals): ‚ÄúAll our scanners depend on direct lighting from above, since we work with pressure glass, so we don‚Äôt have light bulbs on the ceiling.  As for the lineup, Zeutschel has a comfortable book cradle for thick books, for which Plankan has to put an extra backing for this purpose.  But PlanScan has the best of all models focus, higher resolution and scan quality.  We rarely work on Book2Net.  Only in exceptional cases.  Performance and usability are almost the same, but it was easier to train operators on PlanScan.  If we talk about reliability, here the key factors are the design features - Zeutschel is more complex in design, therefore, there is a higher risk of breakage of complex elements and costly repairs.  PlanScan also has problems, but here everything is easier to solve.  Book2Net is not so heavily loaded, so there was no serious damage.  I can say that for us one of the main criteria is the quality of service, because we work a lot and it is necessary to minimize any possible downtime.  For this, fast troubleshooting and good feedback from the manufacturer or supplier are important.  In our case, the best service at the ELAR (approx. Manufacturer Planskan), which meets all the requirements. " <br><br>  Now we are engaged in digitization of educational literature, the old fund and other materials.  We work a lot, scanners are constantly loaded.  Scan quality is good for all models, but PlanScan is cheaper.  In the process, problems periodically occur with all of our scanners, and the nature of breakdowns is different - PlanScan has minor problems, and Zeutschel if it breaks, then seriously.  In terms of service, ELAR works much better than others. <br><br>  At the end of the review we will try to compare the obtained facts.  In our view, PlanScan, Zeutschel and Book2Net are good choices for professional digitization of books, magazines and other stitched paper originals.  All scanners working in the largest library of the country regularly perform their duties, helping to convert thousands of sheets of various library materials into electronic form every day.  PlanScan and Zeutschel are more involved, Book2Net is more limited in use because of the only possible V-shaped operation mode.  The scan quality of all models is quite high; according to the results of the tests performed, the ELAR PlanScan A2B showed the best results in evaluating the optical resolution and depth of field.  During operation, more serious damage occurred at Zeutschel, due to the complex design of the book cradle and pressure glass.  Book2Net and PlanScan broke less often, although the latter had some minor troubles that were quickly fixed by the service staff.  Of course, book scanners are purchased for specific tasks, each model has its own advantages and disadvantages: Book2Net is limited in use, but due to the many settings of the book cradle it is able to scan large non-expanding books until the end of the book, Zeutschel is complex in design and at the same time convenient for digitizing books with a thick spine, on PlanScan scan quality is higher.  In general, the analysis shows some differences in the manufacturers' approaches to the creation of their products. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/254765/">https://habr.com/ru/post/254765/</a></p>
