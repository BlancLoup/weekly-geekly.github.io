If you work with clients through Upwork (formerly the exchange was called oDesk), then you should definitely be aware of future changes in service commissions.  Currently there is a fixed rate of 10%.  However, from June 2016, it will start to vary from 5% to 20%.  Those freelancers who are engaged in small and inexpensive projects, not working with the same client more than once, will now pay not 10% of their earnings, but 20%. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In short, the interest rate will be as follows: if prior to receiving money from a client, his past payments in your favor did not reach the threshold of $ 500, you will be withheld 20% of the money received.  When the threshold of $ 500 is reached, the commission is reduced to 10%.  And finally, if the payout threshold has reached $ 10,000, the commission is reduced to 5%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1dc/80c/2d5/1dc80c2d5e6f4385b7c1be904f1f2254.png">

      Their decision to the creators of the service is <a href="https://www.upwork.com/blog/2016/05/upwork-pricing/">explained by the</a> fact that cheap contracts cost Upwork more expensive in terms of service.  As they put it, the search for new customers who will offer you a small contract on the side of the service takes up some resources.  On the other hand, repeat contracts with the same client no longer require Upwork to spend a lot of time looking for and providing you with new clients. <br><br>  Upwork, according to the creators, now seeks to ensure that within the service there are more long-term contracts.  The longer you work with a client, the more payments you get from him, the more you will eventually earn.  You will observe such a picture, approximately, from June, if you submit an application to some hourly project: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/864/ccd/068/864ccd0680d44503bfe0e517740ae223.png"><br><br><h2>  Customers will now pay too </h2><br>  Not only freelancers will feel all the advantages of new changes.  Simultaneously with the introduction of a floating commission, a fixed commission for customers appears.  Now, any transfers within the service will be additionally <s>taxed with a</s> fixed commission of 2.75%.  Customers from the USA, Canada, Australia, the UK and some countries in the Eurozone will be able to pay a fixed amount of $ 25 - instead of a commission for each payment.  This is great news for those who list their employees through Upwork for more than 910 dollars a month. <br><br><h2>  Freelancers reviews </h2><br>  Judging by the reviews of freelancers (see the link ‚ÄúPost on the forum community.upwork.com‚Äù), this innovation (like the majority of ‚Äúinnovations‚Äù Upwork, however) was perceived not very well.  I will give a few examples: <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Signe J:</b> This is a change of punishes, like myself, who offer one-off services.  I write resumes for clients.  I‚Äôm writing another resume because they‚Äôre used successfully.  For me job well done.  I can‚Äôt stretch a resume job into a $ 500 or $ 10,000 + job.  Not a single thing in the world. </blockquote><br>  <i>This change will hurt freelancers like me who do one-time work for one client.</i>  <i>I write a resume for people.</i>  <i>If I do it well, clients no longer return to me for a new resume, because they successfully find a job using it, and they no longer need it.</i>  <i>A new approach to charging commissions punishes me with a larger commission for doing my job well.</i>  <i>I can not find any reason for which I could set the price for writing a resume of $ 500 or $ 10,000 to lower the commission.</i>  <i>None.</i> <br><br><blockquote>  I need to push it on.  ‚ÄúMake your clients rehire‚Äù </blockquote><br>  <i>Extreme changes helped me realize how much I want to take my job away from Upwork.</i>  <i>‚ÄúGet your customers to hire you again and again‚Äù is the same as ‚Äúmake them close the contact and write a [excellent] review.‚Äù</i> <br><br><blockquote>  <b>It</b> was a huge effort for us all.  Clients are below $ 500.  It‚Äôs not a problem.  We want you to use your workout.  No, I am not agree at all. </blockquote><br>  <i>I disagreed with such extreme changes as ‚Äúconnects‚Äù, VAT, and even 10% of the commission - it was a big burden on all of us.</i>  <i>Customers do not want to pay a lot of money;</i>  <i>A very large part of the work is paid below $ 500.</i>  <i>Upwork may not be able to resist the temptation to raise commissions, but we - freelancers, hardworking workers - do not agree with this at all.</i>  <i>We work a lot for Upwork, and they limit us to ‚Äúconnections‚Äù, make us pay VAT, and now they want to take 20% of our earnings?</i>  <i>No, I do not agree.</i> <br><br><blockquote>  <b>It‚Äôs a</b> bit more than a 20% charge.  Here's how it works in reality: <br><br>  PREVIOUS: <br>  Freelancer gross earning $ 100 <br>  Service fee $ 10 <br>  VAT $ 2 <br>  Net = $ 88 <br><br>  NEW: <br>  Freelancer gross earning $ 100 <br>  Service fee $ 20 <br>  VAT = $ 4 <br>  Net = $ 76 <br><br>  $ 12 reduction on $ 88 = 13.6% cut in earnings </blockquote><br>  <i>Even those who work with the same client for a long time need to periodically look for new ones in order to replenish their customer base ... and for this they will now be punished with a 20% commission.</i>  <i>See how it works in reality:</i> <br><br>  <i>EARLIER:</i> <br>  <i>I earned 100 dollars</i> <br>  <i>Paid commission - 10 dollars</i> <br>  <i>VAT paid - $ 2</i> <br>  <i>I got $ 88 on my hands</i> <br><br>  <i>NOW:</i> <br>  <i>I earned 100 dollars</i> <br>  <i>Paid commission - $ 20</i> <br>  <i>VAT paid - $ 4</i> <br>  <i>Received 76 dollars</i> <br><br>  <i>It turns out a decrease in income of 13.6%.</i> <br><br><h2>  Additional information about new commissions </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://community.upwork.com/t5/Announcements/How-new-pricing-works-for-freelancers-frequently-asked-questions/m-p/188022">Post on the forum community.upwork.com</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.upwork.com/blog/2016/05/upwork-pricing/">Publication in the official blog</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.upwork.com/i/pricing/freelancers/">Price Policy for Freelancers</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.upwork.com/i/pricing/clients/">Pricing policy regarding customers</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/300570/">https://habr.com/ru/post/300570/</a></p>
