  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Not on the Phone?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After the number of comments to the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/column/2173/">previous column</a> exceeded 70, I lost the opportunity to fully participate in the discussion.  The essence of it (discussion) was that, in fact, this iPhone of yours is never a revolution, nothing interesting and not compatible with WinAmp.  If in general terms.  Now - more. <br><br>  Yesterday's news that <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/apple/2784.html">it would be impossible to put third-party programs</a> on the <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/apple/2784.html">iPhone</a> on many acted as a cold shower.  Indeed, what is this, nafig, for ‚Äúfull-fledged MacOS X‚Äù, if you cannot attach your favorite Adium to it ?!  :) To begin with, we do not have <strong>reliable</strong> information.  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/the-iphone-is-not-a-smartphone/">The note</a> on engadget is not at all the ultimate truth.  That is, on the move to dismiss the possibility of installing third-party software should not be at least as long as Apple does not speak on this topic.  And she will certainly speak, most likely in that vein, that yes, you are not putting a crap on any phone in which everything is there.  Any functionality can most likely be implemented by widgets.  And over time, most likely, there will appear something like a Mobile iLife, which will include readers, an office and other things necessary for smart owners. <br><br>  The note " <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/apple/2780.html">Apple is not ready to sell the iPhone in Russia</a> " also looks sobering.  It is usual, gentlemen, lies.  First of all, all notes of Lenta.ru on Macs contain errors.  Almost always.  And this time the passage causes a smile: <br><blockquote>  There is also a possibility that the Russians will never see the new Apple product at all, employees of the Russian representative office of the company told the Ribbon.ru. </blockquote>

      Apparently, the employees of Lenta.ru live in some other Russia, where Apple already has a representative office.  In the Russia in which everyone else lives, there is the Russian company Apple IMC, which is the <strong>marketing partner of Apple in Russia</strong> .  That is, this office received the right to trade and advertise Macs and iPods in our country, nothing more. <br><br>  We should also talk about the brand, the battle for which <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/translation/2186/">has already begun</a> .  Do you think Jobs might not have known that the iPhone was owned by Cisco?  And would he just so stupidly go to the conflict, not having some kind of plan?  Either amicably this issue will be settled, or loudly and with fanfare the device will be renamed.  By the way, do you think the Apple iPhone brand has a right to exist? <br><br>  Now let's see what arguments my iPhones argue against iPhone: <br><ul><li>  <strong>The screen will not withstand the constant matsanya fingers.</strong>  Stand-stand, do not hesitate.  It is intended for this :)) </li><li>  <strong>Like the iPod, the iPhone will be poorly compatible with my favorite WinAmp and will not work with my expensive Windows Media Player</strong> .  Apple is a Macintosh company.  You are not indignant that spare parts from Audi are not suitable for Zhiguli?  However, Apple and PC made iTunes.  Of course, it works for you differently than under MacOS.  And it is strange to be surprised.  You can always choose Zune + Nokia 6600 + PDA - here you have an iPhone for Windows.  Convenient, isn't it? </li><li>  <strong>It will be inconvenient to use the touch-screen</strong> .  Here, while I can only say one thing: conceptually, it should be convenient.  In practice, I don‚Äôt know, but judging by the idea ... </li><li>  <strong>no support for 3G networks, no expandable memory, no removable battery, no support for Exchange / Office, no direct download of music from the iTunes Store, no upgrade via WiFi / Bluetooth</strong> .  Support for 3G, Office, Exchange, iTS and the ability to update on wi-fi - backlog for the next, possibly more expensive model.  It will certainly be implemented, it's obvious :)) As for the expandability of memory, I'm sorry, what do you want to expand and what?  8 Gb HDD 512 MB USB Flash Drive?  Do not make me laugh.  Surely, there will be a model with 40 Gb later, but it‚Äôs ridiculous to talk about the absence of memory extensibility for a device on decent HDD sizes. <br></li><li>  <strong>No GPS, small screen, no scroll wheel, little battery power</strong> </li><li>  <strong>Yes, the same sucks as the iPod !!!</strong>  Yep  Only for some reason, this settling iPod captured the absolute majority of users of mp3-players.  And do not cite as an example Windows, which also captured almost all computers: it did it in an empty market, and the iPod in fair competition with worthy rivals :) </li></ul><br><br>  I, friends, have only one conclusion from all of this.  Like many Apple products, the iPhone has caused mixed reactions.  The fans are delighted, the haters - malice.  There are those who have not yet decided - it is these people who express reasonable doubts.  To date, significant shortcomings in the new items from Apple has not been found.  And non-essential will be eliminated by the time the device is on sale. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4930/</a></p>
