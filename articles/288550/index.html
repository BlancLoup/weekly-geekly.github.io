  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review blogs number 34. Year of Blogging</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/184875.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/184875.html</a> <br><br>  Some people think that the past year was the year of the dog, but it is not.  In fact, it was a year of blogging, and my regular reviews are proof of that.  The number of blogs is increasing faster than the population of the planet, and this is a rather big number.  More and more people stop reading news sites and trust blogs, especially if the blogger is an eyewitness to the event.  And if there are several such witnesses?  Why listen to one official version if you can familiarize yourself with several versions of people who have seen everything with their own eyes, and make their own conclusion? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Over the year, even more sites have appeared that allow you to create and maintain your own blog.  True, they almost did not compete with the recognized leaders of blogspot.com and livejournal.com.  They don‚Äôt look for good from the good, why go to some new platforms, if the old one suits you well?  But the portals have taken with redoubled force to introduce blogs into their belly.  Mail.ru, rambler, msn.com, our TUT.BY (although it is not there yet, but very soon) - the list can be continued for a very long time.  And yet, inside the portal, the blog service seems to be flawed, simply because a lot of unnecessary functions and add-ons are hung on to it automatically.  Sometimes it becomes boring to the user already at the stage of setting up his blog and business does not reach blogging itself.  Why is this necessary?  Vaughn "Google" has straightened blogs into a separate website, blogspot.com, and won everybody again.  Or, for example, Yandex did not begin to create its own blog service, but it launched a very powerful blog <a href="http://blogs.yandex.ru/">search</a> , to which it also added a bunch of useful chips.  I admit that if I use Google (even Russian-language) to search on the Internet, then Yandex is exactly what I‚Äôm looking for on blogs. <br><br>  The main innovation for the last year was video blogging.  Which is somewhat surprising when compared with the low popularity of the podcast.  It turned out that people like to watch videos much more than just listen to the sound, even if you have to pay more for traffic or download longer.  A huge role in the popularization of video blogging, of course, played the site <a href="http://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a> .  Of course, users of a modem connection are squeaking, but they cannot do anything about it.  Thus, video blogging spurs the development of high-speed Internet in our country, if not all over the planet.  Amateur mini-series are being created, obscure groups are becoming mega-popular just because they uploaded their video to YouTube.  About our dancer from Belarus not forgotten?  This is the one who is called the second Jackson.  Not willingly, of course, but became a superstar.  And you say blogs bjaka.  You yourself bjaka.

      Perhaps a few words about our Palestinians.  We have, as always, everything is calm, utter calm.  No, of course, something slightly happens somewhere, but from these events it carries such parochialism that I want to hold my nose and spray the room with an air freshener ‚ÄúPine conifer‚Äù.  Yes, inf.by, it seems, lasted a year and even gained some audience.  But you personally read a lot of interesting blogs there?  And in the same LiveJournal?  I am talking about blogs of Belarusians.  Incomparable!  Although the service inf.by is not even very bad, but for now the community still does not add up.  Dnevnik.by is a beautiful design, behind which there are only 400 diaries.  And this is the year of existence!  It turns out that design is not the main thing.  And not even the functional, with which dnevnik.by has no problems.  Well, do not need adolescents, which, apparently, and designed the site to blog.  And if someone leads him, then no one else except the owner is interested in reading it.  It remains to wait for a revelation from our mega-portal: when will it launch its blogs?  From the positive - some of our bloggers have achieved a certain popularity, but you can read about it below. <br><br>  The end of the year was marked by various contests to determine the best bloggers.  Especially the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/rykov_premia">Rykov Prize has</a> succeeded in this, about which disputes will not subside soon.  Throughout its length, the Russian-language blogosphere was shaken by quarrels and showdowns, even the negative touched Belarus, which I wrote about in the last review.  The winners are named, but it is still not clear whether a cash prize will actually be paid, because each winner in the nomination was promised a thousand evergreens, and the main winner is already ten thousand!  For some reason, many people are inclined to think that they are thrown with money.  You can even make bets. <br><br>  No sooner had the Rykov Prize completed, the <a href="http://mrparker.livejournal.com/7219060.html">Parker Prize</a> began.  In contrast to the PR, the PP has a small history already, because the first Parker Prize took place as early as 2002.  True, the prizes, that then, that now, are not distinguished by great value, but they are pleasant to any gourmet - these are bottles of expensive good liquor.  Perhaps for many, such a prize is more valuable than a bundle of some green paper.  In any case, you still have a lot of time to take part at least in this puzomerke. <br><br>  Ordinary bloggers also sum up some results.  Of course, there are a lot of them, and for your example I decided to choose three at random.  This collection is interesting, first of all, as a comparison, like three different people have had a year.  You can compare with yours.  So, <a href="http://serezhs.livejournal.com/233005.html">one</a> , <a href="http://tj-technoiz.livejournal.com/65975.html">two</a> , <a href="http://trankov.livejournal.com/1039017.html">three</a> . <br><br>  ‚ÄúInternet Tricks‚Äù (we pay special attention to this site! Together with <a href="http://habrahabra.ru/">Habrahabr,</a> this is the best thing that has appeared on the Russian Internet over the last year!) Also holds a competition, only here they do not find out who is better.  The contest is called " <a href="http://internetno.net/2006/12/23/polnyiy-spisok-postov-uchastnikov-novogodnego-postopisatelstva">New Year's Writing</a> ", you will find links to all participants on the link provided, and the point of the contest is that you write a small text on a given topic on your blog.  And the theme is simple: "Which site (or several sites) was most useful to me in 2006, the most."  Yes, the question is very similar to the one I ask below.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project, by the way, is borrowed on the <a href="http://problogger.net/">Problogger</a> website.  You can read all the conditions of the contest <a href="http://internetno.net/2006/12/14/groupwriting2006">here</a> .  I hasten to upset those who are going to participate, the acceptance of applications has already been completed.  The winner, by the way, will get an iPod Nano. <br><br>  And at the end of the year it is necessary to conduct various surveys in order to get an objective assessment of the past twelve months and be proud of it over the next twelve months.  In this regard, completely random people were asked one simple question: ‚ÄúWhich blog or blog post did you remember the most in the past year?‚Äù.  Again, quite accidentally, among the respondents were also journalists from KV, as well as the national team of the rest of the world.  Carefully read the answers! <br><br>  <strong>"Computer News"</strong> <br><br>  Max Kurmaz shocked all progressive humanity with the admission that he "... never read any blogs in his life. And he did not write."  Also, Egor Malyzhenkov said that he only visits blogs of friends, and then through their link.  Thank God, the rest of the journalists of the intergalactic newspaper "Computer News" blogs read and shared their results of the past year.  And the chief editor Sergey Poznyak not only shared, but also wrote a full review for the year, but then he was shy and decided to insert only the most-loved ones in the article.  Here they are, journalists "KV". <br><br>  " <em>Personally, I consider blogs to be quite a good invention, since for the most part they are not just author pages, but imply certain informational communities of independent people, live communication. To highlight someone else ... :) In blogs, the main thing is that there are a lot :) In my opinion, well. For example, you start looking for information on some work of art or collections ... and went for a walk on the Internet. This is wonderful,</em> "Christopher splashes with cheerfulness as always. <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>This year was a real surprise for me in terms of not only Belarusian blogging, but also of the world in general. Blogs and weblogs are growing exponentially ‚Äî that is why it‚Äôs very difficult to recall the most memorable posts this year. But I can say a few words on blogs I regularly check out on. First of all, I‚Äôm very impressed with Vasily Utkin‚Äôs blog - even before his diary appeared, I had a very positive impression about this person.</i>  <i>nly nice talk, but also has the ability to draw the listener, or (in this case) the reader unusual presentation of the material. <a href="http://www.sports.ru/section.html%3Fsecid%3D107">Blog Utkin about football</a> -. it is not only useful information but also an analyst in the highest quality Secondly, this year, my attention was drawn Blog " <a href="http://inf.by/inf">Look on the Internet</a> " - despite his youth, he certainly has his regulars and fans. A lot of information from the Network, current political news and humor allow me to keep up with most of the current events in the world.</i>  <i>Finally, the prize of my sympathy goes to LJ <a href="http://vinah.livejournal.com/">vinah</a> , whose notes are just interesting to read in your spare time.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>PS By the way, I forgot to mention another favorite LiveJournal, which is located in my ‚ÄúBookmarks Panel‚Äù (I don‚Äôt use the aggregators, to be honest) - this is the <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/minsk_by">community of my native city of Minsk</a> , where new information appears with enviable efficiency and is of great interest to me .</i>  <i>That, in general, is all.</i>  <i>I cannot read blogs from cover to cover (with the exception of working blogs) due to a banal lack of time, so don‚Äôt blame me for not bringing anything interesting,</i> "Anton Borisov shared his opinion about favorite blogs. <br><br>  " <em>In the outgoing (where, by the way, outgoing? Nobody thought about it?) Year, I came across one very interesting blog, which I have regularly visited since then to read something useful and informative. The address of this blog is: <a href="http://ibsurgeon.blogspot.com/">ibsurgeon.blogspot .com</a> . I think it‚Äôs hardly possible to say better about this blog than its author (by the way, a journalist from the Russian IT edition Computerra): "About the lives of real programmers. In general, there are drafts of a book about our funny (sometimes) life, but it goes hard, but with your support, dear readers, I hope</em>  <em>I‚Äôm waiting for her to finish. I‚Äôm waiting for you every Friday after an anecdote.ru, but before Exler. Or maybe more often. ‚ÄùI can only join these words and recommend this blog to anyone who considers himself a programmer,</em> " Vadim Stankevich calls for a sect of programmers. <br><br>  " <em>Wisdom teeth is nonsense. What a joy to me from the fact that my teeth grew 25-30 years old, without which I have long been easily dispensed? Where were they when I opened beer bottles with my teeth because it was cool? When I snapped the nuts with my teeth? Liver of wisdom, Stomach of wisdom, Heart of wisdom ... - <a href="http://poslan-za-elkoy.livejournal.com/87547.html">this is the theme</a> !</em> ", - Sergey Pozniak claims that he has not yet entered the topic. <br><br>  <strong>The rest of the world</strong> <br><br>  Yes, yes, the world is divided into two unequal parts - those who write for KV and all the rest.  All the others have been reading blogs for the past year as well (it cannot be!).  And they also want to share their opinions on this issue. <br><br>  ‚Äú <em><a href="http://www.livejournal.com/community/minsk_by">Minsk.by</a> is for informativeness and efficiency. Much, of course, garbage, but periodically shoots heavily. Posts about elections and a fight in the train remember at least</em> ,‚Äù recalls the wonderful journalist <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/vsevolod_volkov">Vsevolod Volkov</a> . <br><br>  ‚Äú <em>Due to employment, I don‚Äôt have the opportunity to keep my own blogs or purposefully read blogs. Occasionally, I only see what colleagues and friends send links to, as well as what they write in blogs about TUT.BY (we conduct such monitoring using special software.)

As a result of his article, they will come out in Moscow glossy - the editors read them in the LiveJournal and caught fire</em> ", - promote their compatriots <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/vilitary">Vilitary</a> . <br><br>  " <em>It seems to me that the thousand of our <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/unutranyholas">Internal Voice's</a> Voices should be mentioned. And a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/folder">folder</a> with a story about a boy and Putin. And the launch of an akavita <a href="http://blogs.akavita.by/">search on blogs,</a></em> " <a href="http://art23.livejournal.com/">Art23</a> copywriter lists favorites. <br><br>  " <em>I can‚Äôt mark any blog or post for the whole year, because there were so many of them that it‚Äôs very difficult to recall even the most memorable ones. IMHO, blogs do not exist for sensations and not to be remembered, but to give people an objective and authoritative view of the world.At the beginning of the outgoing year, I began to read a lot of Belarusian LJ-community, because they gave operational information and people‚Äôs opinion on what was happening in the country.The real power of LJ showed in the first half 2006, when through LiveJournal</em>  <em>flash mobs were organized in which a large number of people participated. I almost don‚Äôt read blogs, because I‚Äôve found very little useful information lately.

From the non-ru_bay_netovsky blogs - this year I discovered the blog <a href="http://postsecret.blogspot.com/">postsecret.blogspot.com</a> . open this blog and look at the new secrets of the English-speaking Internet users who (the secrets) they (the Internet users) send in the form of postcards or collages to the author of the blog.
