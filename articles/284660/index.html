In support of them today, I launched the website <a href="http://xn--90abbh9ahjbcakq5ad4a2h.xn--p1ai/">Svobodupukhov.rf</a> (barely managed to NG :), where you can put your signature on the petition to cancel article 146 of the Criminal Code in relation to the Internet space - subscribe and call your friends!  Gradually, I will publish on the site case materials and news from the court.  I suppose next year this process will become central to the Russian IT industry. <br><br>  Like everyone else, I followed the Lopukhovs process with interest, after all, it is a case-law ‚Äî how its outcome will be decided, and it will be done in Russia with pirates.  Since I myself use torrents and sit on VKontakte, the matter concerned me personally - I decided to help Lopukhov with something.

      Recalling that last year I signed up for the Pirate Party of Russia, I contacted her leadership and found out that the Lopukhovs did not have a good deal.  RAPO puts pressure on them.  Under the threat of copyright advocates from the Lopukhovs, even a lawyer escaped and the very first hearings on December 7th would definitely have lost. <br><br>  I immediately learned that the RAPO was not just so zealous - the government decided to seriously weaken article 146, about copyright infringement and, apparently, the RAPO would remain without work with the new legislation, so they need a bright precedent to show how economically dangerous piracy .  Accordingly, the punishment of the pirates must be tightened.  But where to tighten it, if now for copying one film give more than for killing a man.  Literally, for murder with facilitators they give from 5 years of prison, and by 146 they give up to 6 years - can one film be more important than human life? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f3/017/1b4/2f30171b47cb43fa7223a0762ea5ead8.jpg"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  This situation needs to be changed.  Fortunately, my girlfriend's mother has been a lawyer for thirty years and, just under copyright (for example, she worked with Viktor Tsoi), her colleague, who also agreed to do business, works as a personal lawyer with Boris Akunin on copyright issues.  After reviewing the case, both lawyers were hm-hm ... "surprised" - there all the accusation is built on the screenshots from the site interfilm.ru - they say, you see, there is a movie on the site and 46 downloads are written?  Let's evaluate the damage as if the 20th century Fox sold the interfilm a license to hire his paintings. <br><br>  How such a case reached the court remained a mystery for us, but at the first hearing the court had to return the case for re-registration to the prosecutor's office, and a criminal case of abuse of authority was brought to the investigation team.  This is the first victory, of course, it pleases, but to have legal proceedings with all Hollywood is a hopeless occupation - Hollywood knows and loves this business, he does not mind the money for the courts. <br><br>  Lopukhovs were left without work due to the pressure of RAPO and retired elderly parents with two young children in their arms.  At the same time, lawyers prohibit collecting Lopukhov financial assistance, since  It can be used against them in court.  All I can do to help is to give this cause maximum public resonance. <br><br>  Therefore, I decided to start with the "victims" themselves - I first contacted Smeshariki and it turned out that they did not file any lawsuits and, in general, RAPO does this without their knowledge.  Smeshariki themselves are against this process and are ready to officially oppose the prosecution of pirates.  The official response will be in January, but for now I decided to draw the attention of journalists to the reaction of Smeshariki and made a short film about how we conducted the action in support of the smeshariki.  I hope it turned out realistic :) <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ChCJ4LP0eNg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLpnFq6OALEyOoDXhbeWEuXamhTA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284660/</a></p>
