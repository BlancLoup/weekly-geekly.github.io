Go Project</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Hello to all </h3><br>  Thank you so much "Megamind" for the opportunity to write about startups!  When you realize that your work is interesting not only for you, when you are ready to provide support - it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it is financial or informational - it‚Äôs great, it perfectly motivates you to continue working and just leads you to a good mood. <br><br><h2>  Who we are (Part of the ship - part of the team) </h2><br>  We are <b>the iLe! Go Project</b> team.  Our body is young and prone to growth, development and transformations, so for now, only my (main ideologue and only sponsor) and my main assistant can indicate the status for sure.  Now we still have an engineer who is developing a printed circuit board for the main device (to my regret, I did not manage to grasp the basics of Altium Designer), there is a designer, an application developer for mobile devices.  While the composition is such, but we willingly accept new team members who want to participate in the development of the project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  What we do (Board, module, cucumber, turned out man) </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d04/cc2/7b8/d04cc27b888a4d4faa9a0cd9ea32c6a5.jpg">

      We create a universal constructor.  With the help of this device and a set of modules you can collect an infinite number of gadgets, robots, mechanoids and other useful pieces.  The main device is a board with 32 contact groups in the upper part for installing most of the modules and 2 contact groups in the lower part for connecting the battery and SSD drives.  Due to the requirement of reusable fastening, we have gone from the need for contact use of wires and connectors.  All modules are attached to the mainboard with magnets. <br><br><h2>  Why do we do this (Golden hands for everyone) </h2><br>  I have been playing with Arduino and possible modifications for a long time, and from the very beginning I was worried about the question: ‚ÄúWhy is the build process always so complicated?‚Äù.  In order to collect some kind of device, you need to arm yourself with a soldering iron and patience, and after all the manipulations you need to write sketches and pour everything into the microcontroller.  This is more or less simplified implemented in the sets of Nesting dolls from Amperki, but I wanted to be even simpler, I didn‚Äôt even want to understand intuitively, but directly plug and play in the assembly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e75/bdb/798/e75bdb798e59452c8fbebdb369b083f9.jpg"><br><br>  Therefore, the idea was born to combine the availability of Arduino with ease of assembly from Lego - and so was born the <b>iLe! Go Project</b> .  This is not the name of the future product, but rather a certain concept of self-designation during the development of our solution. <br><br>  In the course of work, I realized that in the name of us as a team you should not go away from modularity, and we took for ourselves another name for the community <b>Imody</b> .  I Like Modularity / I Like Modularity - under this motto we launched the site <a href="http://www.imody.ru/">www.imody.ru</a> . <br><br><h2>  A bit about the future sales model (Three treasured boxes) </h2><br>  It looks very simple and is borrowed from card games. <br><br>  Three boxes of different colors: <br>  <b>White box:</b> The main box, peripheral modules, buttons, LEDs, connectors for interaction with external devices will be delivered in the white box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc4/b91/56b/dc4b9156b7514b039a63fd704e575c15.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Blue box:</b> In the blue box you can find the main modules, screens, sensors, sensors, speakers and other useful modules. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b79/61f/0f0/b7961f0f05df4e0c99298339ac0c27af.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Red box:</b> Red box is designed to be constructive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c7/22d/dd3/6c722ddd372d4ad6889b19f5d38bcf46.jpg"><br><br>  I really wanted to make the iLe! Go Project completely Russian, but the ‚Äúheart‚Äù of the device and controllers that are responsible for the pairing of modules in Russia, unfortunately, are not made. <br><br>  For the first time there are so many letters, I myself don‚Äôt like to read long articles, so I‚Äôll leave a story about how I‚Äôm looking for and looking for a perfect body shape for the future: we don‚Äôt just have a fee, but a designer.  I will also share with you what valuable advice was received on reworking the presentation and the prototype of the product. <br><br>  Thanks for getting to the end!  I am pleased to read your comments and answer questions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290284/</a></p>
