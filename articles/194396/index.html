  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Nikon CoolPix S01: a small camera for women and not only</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Recently chose a gift for the DR for a good friend.  The gift was needed in such a way that it looked cool, and that it was typically female, and that it cost moderate money - in general, the task turned out to be not as simple as I thought at the very beginning.  (Spirits, teddy bears, cups and other ‚Äústamped‚Äù variants were not considered for a number of reasons.) I thought about the new keyboard, and about the headphones, and the flash drive, but eventually bought a Nikon CoolPix S01 camera.  Just saw her on the shelf in the store - and immediately realized that this was IT.  In short, this thing (and pulls to say "little thing") is a very good option for the role of a gift to anyone.  And that's why. <br><br>  Nikon CoolPix S01 costs about $ 80 (about 2,700 rubles or 650 hryvnia).  For this money, we get, on the one hand, quite an adequate pocket camera that can compete with the cameras of the current top-end smartphones.  Moreover, in some ways the S01 beats them: it has a triple optical zoom.  On the other hand, this thing looks very cool - especially in the red version: it is small and ‚Äúmimic‚Äù.  There are five color options in total, besides red I have also seen silver.  He is not so effective, but still not bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e94/0e1/3f7/e940e13f761ce31a6c8154b731fd37e2.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I thought that Nikon CoolPix S01 can be handed over, for example, to someone who has a smartphone with a bad camera.  Well, or he himself can buy such a fotik: in my humble opinion, adequate shots can only get smarts with a price of 20 thousand rubles and more;  if you have any device for 5 thousand, then Nikon CoolPix S01 will be a good addition to it.  You say you don't want to carry two gadgets with you at once?  I readily believe, but the key feature of the camera in question is just the microscopic dimensions: 77 x 51 x 17.2 mm and weight in 96 g. It fits without problems not only in a shirt pocket, but also in a pocket on jeans designed for a lighter.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/49c/1ca/b7a/49c1cab7ac3042303716f883769e4ad1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/e3d/cd6/29c/e3dcd629c39172a358b22fe206361ec5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/6b5/afa/9fb/6b5afa9fba858c1c56a82a0f1f67da83.jpg"><br><br>  True, with the Nikon CoolPix S01 you can not put pictures in a social network or send by mail - and this is his serious disadvantage in comparison with smartphones.  And without the participation of a computer, this cannot be done at all: there is no slot for memory cards in the device - only about 7.3 GB of built-in memory is provided.  So, removing the flash drive from the camera and inserting it into the smartphone / tablet will not work (I sometimes do this in the case of the Kodak EasyShare C123 Sport and Highscreen Black Box Outdoor).  So you want to view the photos on the big screen - welcome to the computer.  It is a pity that the cable here is unusual - that is, not miniUSB or microUSB, but with a small branded Nikon plug. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/639/560/f8e/639560f8e65679598b34a0d84c31213c.jpg"><br><br>  "Pleased" screen.  Its diagonal is 2.4 inches, it is touch, but resistive.  That is, it brings us back to the days of Windows Mobile: sometimes you click on the display, but nothing happens.  You press harder - and the required submenu opens.  There is no ‚Äúmultitouch‚Äù when scaling photos, of course, no.  I don‚Äôt dare to assess the quality of the screen - as for me, it is terrible, but in general all screens are priced at about the same price of 150-200 dollars. <br><br>  As for the interface and settings, they are as simple as possible.  By the way, I also thought about buying a Nikon CoolPix S01 to my mother - she‚Äôs been looking at my Nikon CoolPix S800c for a long time, lying on a shelf, but ... Android is there, with all the consequences, so you don‚Äôt hand it to a respectable lady - it‚Äôs confused and will terrorize on the phone in the style of "and here on the screen, ta-a-ah-something got out!  what exactly - I do not know, but help !!! ".  So with the Nikon CoolPix S01 such a problem will not arise.  The camera turns on exactly one second, has only four buttons (power on, shooting with the zoom lever, gallery and home), and its interface is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/1bf/7eb/632/1bf7eb632a480ff481a0d0f84ae008ea.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f11/7b1/4a7/f117b14a77a5bc335281b3326ea41405.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/032/87d/6b6/03287d6b6c2d1e16424ed34cf5722279.png"><br><br>  In general, everything is very simple.  It is impossible to select subjects manually - the camera automatically exposes them: ‚Äúmacro‚Äù, ‚Äúportraits‚Äù, ‚Äúlandscapes‚Äù, ‚Äúnight portraits‚Äù, ‚Äúnight landscapes‚Äù, ‚Äúbacklit objects‚Äù and ‚Äúother objects‚Äù.  Automatically adjusted and ISO.  You can manually enable only the self-timer, specify the flash mode, adjust the exposure and select the image resolution - 10, 4 or 2 megapixels.  For videos, there are two options: HD720 and VGA.  Instead of the flash mode in the case of video, you can select the autofocus mode - frame-by-frame and continuous. <br><br>  You can also choose one of four effects: "sepia", "black and white", "high key" (bright pictures) and "low key" (dark gloomy pictures).  Later, when the picture is ready, a number of effects can be applied to it: the ‚Äútoy camera effect‚Äù, ‚Äúsoft‚Äù, ‚Äúfisheye‚Äù and so on.  In general, the target audience will appreciate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/10e/80e/323/10e80e323d09a22800d3d9a8139b40cb.jpg"><br>  <i>Fisheye shot</i> <br><br>  Any experienced user will obviously not like this approach, but the user of the ‚Äúteapot‚Äù of this nuance may not notice: some of my friends were terribly surprised when I showed them how many settings in the camera of their phone.  Just usually they fotkali in the "auto" mode and never climbed into the settings. <br><br>  The photon part of the Nikon CoolPix S01 even by the standards of ‚Äúsoap cases‚Äù is not too serious: 10.1-megapixel CCD-matrix of 1 / 2.9 ‚Äùformat, focal length in 35-mm equivalent - 29-87 mm, aperture - f / 3 , 3-5.9, and so on.  In fact, the pictures are worse than the Samsung Galaxy S4.  So, in low light, the Nikon's camera is noticeably inferior to the smartphone - the photos come out ‚Äúnoisy‚Äù and grainy.  But still better quality than smarts thousands in 10. <br><br>  Several pictures taken in different modes and at different times of the day: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/664/5bd/c97/6645bdc9765290674edcf1380a59215d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/c0b/df7/846/c0bdf78464fccba01d59e2de3a2e482e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/b41/293/0f9/b412930f91887865c37df059a2d716a1.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/944/b1f/172/944b1f172595445e141a47624c500073.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/53c/cc4/aa4/53ccc4aa469c8c81f8bffc05a731aec4.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/464/48c/4f9/46448c4f9d21c19093005a83f6f36a28.jpg"><br><br>  As I said above, the most important advantage of the Nikon CoolPix S01 over smartphones is the triple optical zoom.  Well, another flash - it is here xenon, not LED.  For me personally, these moments are quite important, I really miss them in smartphones (I know about the Samsung Galaxy S4 zoom, but sorry, it's too scary externally). <br><br>  7.3 GB of memory can hold 3,000 pictures at a resolution of 10 megapixels or half an hour of video in the HD720p.  In my opinion, yes, devices of this class are more than enough.  Again: the camera is ready to work immediately after the purchase, and the user does not have to buy a flash card.  The battery in the Nikon CoolPix S01 is not removable, it lasts about 170 frames.  There are no slots for mounting a tripod.  In general, everything is for ordinary people - read, for "dummies" in photography, who need to shoot kittens, the sky and butterflies.  And after all the comrades with similar requests are the majority. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/f2c/920/19c/f2c92019c3e328dd63636d866c23d0f6.jpg"><br><br>  There is such a type of thing - ‚Äúflesh of flesh gifts‚Äù.  That is, you yourself would never have bought it, but with the help of your neighbor you would gladly be happy with it.  Nikon CoolPix S01 is just one of them: this is a cool cute thing that can cause an attack of emotion in almost any girl (unless, of course, she wears a DSLR in her backpack for two thousand bucks with a dozen lenses for every taste).  In my opinion, this camera does not have critical flaws, especially considering the price and dimensions.  She provokes a flurry of emotions - tested in practice. <br><br>  PS In early September, Nikon announced the second version of this camera - CoolPix S02.  She writes video in Full HD, and the CMOS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãthere, and there are more megapixels.  But the red version is no longer, but sorry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage3/10f/8c8/268/10f8c826839997205fa4b2dfa87d74e2.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/194396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/194396/</a></p>
