  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Habraobzor Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 - one more in the field which warrior!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Something here I did not see on the habr of the reviews of the new tablet from Samsung, namely the Galaxy Note 8.0.  The search issued only announcements from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/driverx18/" class="user_link">driverx18</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/flyant/" class="user_link">flyant users</a> But it seems to me that it can be a good competition for iPad mini!  I managed to use both the iPad mini and Galaxy Note 8.0.  But I chose the last one.  Because I do not like iOS and that's it!  But I‚Äôll tell you about my experience of communicating with Note 8.0 under the cut :) I just warn you right away, I‚Äôm a girl, I can do it without strong technical details!  :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9fc/ef5/e4c/9fcef5e4c6153a2878d2b16d9556ce96.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <b>Solid price</b> </h4><br>  Sly Koreans obviously took into account the lack of serious competitors on Android in this size and set a seemingly indecently high price level: 17 990 rubles for a tablet with Wi-Fi and 21 990 with a built-in 3G modem.  The amount of memory offered is the same - 16 GB.  Supporters of the "apples" immediately giggled - they say, and our mini is cheaper (ten rubles, 13 and 19 thousand)! <br><br>  But Samsung is tricky to sell a novelty for about the same money, considering the increase in memory: a mini with 32 GB costs 17 or 23 thousand rubles, depending on the availability of a modem.  And in Apple devices there is no such slot for microSD cards, which makes it possible to charge 4-5 thousand from above for additional memory.  In this case, the owner of the tablet on Android will go and buy a 16 GB card for 700 rubles, 32 for a thousand and 64 for a half.  In the latter case, however, you need to proceed with caution: not every card will accept Note 8.0 in an open slot.  But native, "Samsung", just take it, only it will come out more expensive.

    <h4>  <b>Design and management</b> </h4><br>  In addition to the memory slot, there are headphone jacks on the ends of the tablet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8f6/929/469/8f6929469a389f71b8c402fa8fb51708.jpg"><br>  and recharging <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f24/1ab/23b/f241ab23b4ed541f625e7a0892c8436a.jpg"><br>  as well as the power and volume buttons <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/35f/381/286/35f381286f4a66eb4e62dffd62855dec.jpg"><br><br>  And also - a connector for the S Pen and a completely unexpected IR port. <br><br>  This is not a replacement for Bluetooth and not a joke for conservatives, but a way to control ... a TV.  Yes, Samsung has attacked (albeit not the first one lately - remember the HTC One) to the ever-lost consoles.  You need to turn on Wi-Fi, open the Smart Remote application, select the TV brand and direct the tablet with an infrared port in its direction.  Everything!  Of course, Grandma's Rubin is unlikely to appreciate this approach, but any smart TV will easily. <br><br>  Let's return, however, to management.  Below the display are the buttons "Menu", "Home" and "Back."  Two of them are sensory (you can click and pen), the third is not, but it would be better to make it also tactile: sometimes there are doubts about its durability.  After a month of use, she began to fall slightly, about 20 times.  Well, let's see what happens next. <br><br>  In general, the appearance of the tablet can be described by the word "elegant".  I strongly disagree with the opinion that this is a stretched Galaxy S III, they do not have much in common.  The sighs of the Tab 7.7 design and the metal iPad are not very clear to me either: the absolute majority of customers immediately load the case on the tablet, and they wanted to spit on the smooth lines of the corners and the back panel's texture (which, by the way, almost does not get dirty).  And rightly so: Note 8.0 got a rather slippery body, and falling onto a hard floor or, especially, asphalt can be fatal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/75a/b32/be2/75ab32be26e72b0dc3a764e8a833075e.jpg"><br><br>  Speaking of covers.  I don‚Äôt know how now, but in the first days of sales there were a lot of defective company covers.  I tried on three red and one white - none could keep the tablet in a standing position.  I had to look not original, heavier and thicker (and cheaper!), But a reliable case. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/11c/871/dcb/11c871dcbba7aa52319e786b2b37729e.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Display</b> </h4><br>  In addition to claims to the design, some critics spit on the screen (well, that‚Äôs not on it).  Where have you seen it - only 1280 by 800, but what about movies in 1080p?  But none of my many acquaintances look at the Full HD tablet, even if the screen allows.  This is almost meaningless, given the diagonal, and for HD content you can choose a more interesting screen.  You can even connect Note 8.0 with a microUSB-HDMI cable (yes, it supports MHL) and watch the much-wanted 1920 x 1080 on the TV.  The benefit of "iron" reproduces such content without any problems. <br><br>  Display Note 8.0, meanwhile, is quite good.  Instead of the Super AMOLED loved by Koreans, there is a PLS-matrix, that is, the colors are close to reality, and the viewing angles are still large.  You can ‚Äúpry‚Äù the tablet by fading in the direct sun, but show me at least one where you can see everything under direct rays. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e8e/020/117/e8e0201170204174538a0c29f752560f.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Opportunities</b> </h4><br>  It is clear that Galaxy Note 8.0 is able to do everything that you can be able to on the Android platform.  The quad-core Samsung Exynos 4412 processor with four cores and a clock frequency of 1.6 GHz plus 2 GB of RAM allows you not to worry about the resource-intensive games and run as many applications as you need (the iPad mini, by the way, is more modest for two cores, 600 MHz and 1, 5 GB RAM).  This is true: Note 8.0 never hung, no matter how much I chased it.  True, in difficult cases, he stops himself.  For example, in the Multi Window mode, when you can display two windows at once, it does not allow YouTube and the standard media player to start simultaneously. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/06e/ebf/f44/06eebff44b76ff6ced47d27d96a7bdb4.jpg"><br>  Interestingly, the version with a 3G modem can also be used for calls.  It looks quite funny, but it is quite possible to do without a separate phone at all. <br><br>  I think that no one reading should tell us what Google Play is.  So I will talk about Samsung Apps, but also a little: there are still quite a few applications there, and for the most part these are analogs of software from the main store.  But there is a useful rubric for S Pen.  There are a couple of dozen of them, mostly games, ‚Äúdrawing machines‚Äù and synthesizer simulators.  For example, in Sudoku you can write the numbers once, as you do with a regular pen, and then just click in the desired empty box - and write your own answer in an enlarged field. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/55f/87c/fee/55f87cfee5d732b1676387515e121eba.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>S pen</b> </h4><br>  By the way, it is completely incomprehensible to me why some commentators on Note 8.0 doubt the need for S Pen.  Like, we have already left the Stone Age stylus, and Samsung is driving us back.  In fact, this is a cool thing, already tested on a 10-inch tablet and two tablet phones, but here it is even more appropriate.  Those who say that the display does not keep up with the pen when writing, certainly didn‚Äôt really hold it in their hands.  Even as time!  And he recognizes the words quite well, for nothing, that I have a terrible handwriting. <br><br>  To give an example, I wrote the phrase twice (the first one he immediately recognized and removed the original, the second one wrote in the ‚Äújust letters‚Äù mode).  By the way, it is also convenient to take a screenshot with S Pen: press the button and touch the screen for a second.  And any part of the image can be circled with the button pressed, cut and then collage. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5b9/abc/912/5b9abc912ee2aa8c6af4df84d7cb1018.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc9/6e0/8e8/dc96e08e8824d18410984a8b8192b61f.jpg"><br><br>  And how much simple human happiness in entering handwritten notes into the organizer!  If in the usual S Note, recognition starts a second after the end of the phrase, then in the cumbersome aNote HD and other third-party applications - as soon as the pen is pulled off the boom ... that is, the screen.  We have to combine words in incredible ways, and the tablet realizes what was meant. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cb8/817/ac5/cb8817ac5c9777419550a8c4267f58a3.jpg"><br><br>  S Note, by the way, is a very convenient thing.  There are 10 basic templates for creating your own notes: from free notes to a recipe - and you can write, insert photos from your own 5 megapixel camera (good, but there are better, and there is no flash for some reason) or others, and even draw without limits. <br><br>  In general, there are many ways to use S Pen.  It‚Äôs more convenient to select quotes in texts, press small icons and letters on the keyboard (especially in the vertical position of the tablet), play virtual snooker and write, excuse me, formulas - even the lazy one has already said that.  Oh yeah, even when unlocking with a pen, ink is spilled on the background image, very funny. <br><br>  Maybe someone doesn‚Äôt need all this, but now there are practically no really cool 8-inch Android tablets without a pen on the market, no matter how funny it sounds.  And the form factor is very successful: you can hold it with one hand, and the main screen is optimized for the vertical for more convenience <br><br><h4>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h4><br>  Of course, the price of the Samsung Galaxy Note 8.0 is at first somewhat overestimated, but it will certainly decrease.  And almost nothing more to present to him.  The design may not be the most prestigious, but worthy, ‚Äúfilling‚Äù is modern (for that matter, the version with Full HD will surely come out in the foreseeable future), the S Pen is commendable.  The battery is very tenacious: you can read with an average brightness for more than 10 hours, watch a movie at a maximum of 5, use the Internet about 8. <br><br>  You can write a lot about this tablet, but the Internet is not rubber.  So what is not included in the review, I am pleased to tell in the comments :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181424/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181424/</a></p>
