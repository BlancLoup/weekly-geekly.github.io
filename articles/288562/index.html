      The first came a press release from the <a href="http://dnevnik.by/">Belarusian Diaries</a> service, about which I once wrote and even promised you to take a mini-interview with its creators.  But first about the press release.  Its essence was that dnevniki.by, together with the <a href="http://hit.by/">HIT-TV</a> project, created an opportunity for Belarusian users to conduct video blogs, download and share private video, and so on.  Moreover, the limit of space for placing files on the server was raised 50 times, now it is 500 MB for a regular user.  Such a sudden activity of the creators of the ‚ÄúBelarusian Diaries‚Äù after a year of hibernation was the reason for a mini-interview. <br><br>  <i>Why did you decide to make your service?</i>  <i>Do you think there is a shortage of blogging services?</i> <br><br>  The fact is that the project dnevnik.by was created as part of a certain conglomerate of sites whose main audience is youth: library.by (works) + dnevnik.by (works) + hit.by (works) + student.by + shkola.by + seks.by.  Since 3 out of 6 sites will be launched only by September 1, 2007, we have not advertised any of the projects individually or all together. <br><br>  <i>Why is the advertising campaign to promote dnevnik.by so weak?</i>  <i>The service was opened over a year ago, and almost no resonance.</i>  <i>A little more than 600 diaries, in my opinion, a very modest figure.</i> <br><br>  We have the opportunity to support projects and develop them on a non-commercial basis, therefore we would not like to advertise them ahead of time or receive any profit from them.  Moreover, at the moment they are practically not merged.  That is, do not constitute a single entity.  And to advertise projects in this state is impossible. <br><br>  <i>What do you plan to do to make your service more popular?</i>  <i>Do you plan to carry out promotions?</i> <br><br>  We plan to begin active work after the start and consolidation of all projects in the fall of this year.  Those.  Advertising is the most important component of the success of any project.  But so far we have not taken advantage of it, because we do not consider our projects to be quite strong.  We are interested in stability and future, not short-term, but quickly passing glory. <br><br>  <i>Why did you initially focus on teenagers?</i>  <i>Do not you think that this niche has long been firmly occupied by liveinternet.ru?</i> <br><br>  In general, we plan to open the service of already ‚Äúadult‚Äù blogs.  In addition to all the capabilities of the ‚ÄúDiary.by‚Äù service, this project will have the following advantages: it will represent the possibilities of ‚Äúmobile‚Äù and ‚Äúemail‚Äù blogging, i.e.  when a user can update his blog via mail or mobile phone. <br><br>  <i>What are the future plans for technical development dnevnik.by?</i>  <i>Will it come close to myspace.com in its functionality?</i> <br><br>  We have done the first service in Bynet where video blogging is possible (tv.dnevnik.by or hit.by), and we are planning to ‚Äúpull‚Äù Belarusian blogs to world standards here.  Especially since mobile and email blogging will be more popular because  for video blogging, you need expensive equipment (camera), video processing knowledge, expensive Internet for Belarus and traffic, courage (after all, showing your photos is one thing, and your video is another, higher ‚Äúlevel of courage‚Äù). <br><br>  Also, the new service will have more opportunities for statistics, interactivity. <br><br>  We are planning to introduce other new products that are not in the Belarusian segment of the Internet.  But for now, they would not want to talk about this, so as not to prompt successful solutions to their competitors.  Moreover, we make plans and successfully implement them, i.e.  do not stand still.  We do not dream, we do. <br><br>  In any case, after the release of "adult" blogs, we will tighten to a higher standard and "Dnevnik.by". <br><br>  <i>Photos and videos can already be downloaded, but what about music?</i> <br><br>  You can upload music (.mp3) and photos, as well as text files (.doc, .rtf, .pdf) to Diary.by.  Here is the full list of available formats: jpeg, jpg, gif, bmp, png, pdf, doc, zip, rar, txt, rtf, ppt, swf, uha.  The video should be uploaded to tv.dnevnik.by - there it will be available for viewing online. <br><br>  <i>Thanks for the detailed answers!</i> <br><br>  Alexey, ask if something is not clear or if clarifications are needed.  We will also promptly inform you about new products! <br><br>  <i>It's time to kill the hares!</i> <br><br>  In the last review, I told you about a competitor, <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/by_review">BY Blogal Review</a> , a review of Belarusian blogs.  I did not waste time in vain and even managed to talk with the creator of this review.  Correspondence in the format of "Question-Answer" I bring to your attention. <br><br>  <i>Introduce youreself.</i>  <i>Or do you prefer to remain incognito?</i> <br><br>  No, I have nothing to hide.  :) My name is Dmitry Todarev. <br><br>  <i>Immediately question the forehead.</i>  <i>Why do you need it?</i>  <i>Why did you start these reviews?</i> <br><br>  Then why people blogging.  To share what you have.  In this, perhaps, the main difference between blogs from the world off-line.  ‚ÄúLife‚Äù around us is dominated by the culture of consumption: your weight in society is the more, the more you can get.  Online is the opposite.  A blogger must give a lot to his readers, the entire Internet, in order to become meaningful, "authoritative." <br><br>  Returning to your question, everything happened by itself.  I began to notice that many interesting posts of Belarusian zhizhis appeared, I wanted to share them, but this kind of links did not fit the format of my personal blog.  In addition, we (among the Belarusian Zhizhistov) have very weak social activity of bloggers.  That is, it is not customary to share with your friends interesting materials, they mainly lay out their own.  Such a specificity.  So I created BY_review to kill two birds with one stone: unload the personal blog and try to socialize the Belarusian segment of LJ. <br><br>  <i>What is the criterion for a blog link in your review?</i>  <i>Yes, we know that the best in Belarusian LiveJournal is being viewed.</i>  <i>But, firstly, how is Belarusianness determined, and, secondly, what do you mean is ‚Äúthe best‚Äù?</i>  <i>And, thirdly, is it planned to include in the review stand-alone blogs or blogs from other services (blogspot, liveinternet, etc.)?</i> <br><br>  Belarusianness is determined by the country of residence indicated in the profile :).  Also published links to other users whose posts are related to our country.  The best is the one that caused the greatest response, which I personally or any other blogger liked.  Anyone can send a link.  But I, as an editor, still remain the last resort.  Guided by common sense and a sense of beauty.  There are no clear criteria, I can only say that the ‚Äúbest‚Äù never gets: lyddybr (personal records), stream of consciousness, posts for a narrow circle of initiates, illiterate records (without observing punctuation, register of letters and the simplest structure of the text). <br><br>  Stand-alone blogs appear in reviews, but not often.  They simply do not send links.  And so, there is no discrimination, the post is important, not the playground :). <br><br>  <i>What is the frequency of releases?</i> <br><br>  Now 3 times a week.  At first, I tried to make BY_review a daily newspaper, but I quickly realized that there was not enough content in the Belarusian zhezheshechka for this purpose. <br><br>  <i>How is the content of the review formed?</i> <br><br>  The content directly depends on the intensity of life and the general trends of BelZHZH.  The issue may contain ten references of one direction, and maybe more than twenty, and on completely different topics.  I collect the material myself and send other zhizhists.  In this sense, BY_review fully justifies its name and is a ‚Äúmirror‚Äù of BelZHZH. <br><br>  <i>Are there any required rubrics or does freestyle reign in every review?</i> <br><br>  There are rubrics, but these are rather characteristics of a certain group of posts.  For example, ‚Äúsocial‚Äù, ‚Äúhumor‚Äù or ‚Äútravel notes‚Äù.  They will not necessarily be in the room, but they will appear if at least a couple of links to records of this subject come. <br><br>  <b>People are dying for the metal!</b> <br><br>  They decided to hold a funny advertising campaign ‚Äú <a href="http://naviny.by/">Belarusian News</a> ‚Äù, although now I understand that for me it will turn into a nightmare.  The meaning of the action is to bring as many visitors as possible to the Belarusian News website.  To do this, you can use the content of the Belarusian News in any way: reprint materials, quote them, post links, invite to view multimedia and participate in the forum ... A gold bar is promised as the main prize, and silver bar for the second place.  You can read details about the participation in the action and the prizes on the <a href="http://naviny.by/rubrics/society/2007/02/12/ic_articles_116_149683">Belarusian News</a> website, but I will return to what worries me.  This article is written two days before the release of the latest issue of "KV", and I already caught sight of two posts advertising naviny.by in blogs.  Naturally, more will continue.  And I will not have to will to monitor all these blogs, so as not to miss something interesting.  Straight at least until March 31 (the time of the end of the action) to the monastery go away so that all this legalized spam can not be seen.  Although, on the other hand, I was immensely pleased that at least someone in our country appreciated the advertising potential of blogs.  And not stupid putting down the reference to naviny.by, but the use of content and all sorts of integration of the blog and the news system is encouraged.  It personally makes me wait with the conclusions and see what all the same in the end will work out.  It is possible that blogs will simply appear more quotes from the news, which will make reading these blogs with great attention to what is happening in the country and the world.  Because we have the usual position - my hut is on the edge.  In addition, the gold bar is never superfluous! <br><br>  <b>Thought Transmitter Alexey Khaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2007070601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 7, 2007)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288562/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288562/</a></p>
