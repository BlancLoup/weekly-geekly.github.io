  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About the digital economy, fires and the Internet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  August 26 in the near suburbs, namely in the neighborhood Jubilee Korolev, there was a fire in an apartment building (you can google "Korolev fire on Lenin 4"): <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lf/d0/i7/lfd0i78znafl79ot0qdyyrjgnra.png"></div><br>  The fire was <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/video/1630867/">shown</a> on all central and off-center television channels.  No one expected that the roof and upper apartments would burn down along the entire length of the house, but this happened.  It did not help quenching all day, nor even a helicopter. <br><br>  But I wanted to tell about the other.  Misfortune happened, people lost their apartments.  My friend burned EVERYTHING.  And I'm not talking about that.  On the ground floor of this building is our small, but very high-tech company.  We are not many, but we can do a lot.  We are mostly programmers, our workspace is the Internet (which costs one certifying center). <br>  And here we are instantly left without a workspace.  The fire has passed us, but the water has not passed.  The most important thing was not the Internet, not electricity. <br><br>  But we are a small business, the support of the state.  Help us.  Helped, our modest appeals to the state administration bodies had one result - the wrong address.  Tried to appeal through the <a href="https://dobrodel.mosreg.ru/">Virtue</a> .  The answer came, register through your personal account and finally the answer came: <br><blockquote>  Your message about problem ‚Ññ1927834 was not moderated because it does not comply with the rules for submitting messages.

      3.1 The message does not correspond to the topics proposed on the portal. </blockquote>  What rules are not followed, what topics does not correspond?  It all remains a mystery <br><br>  God bless them with government agencies.  We urgently need a telephone connection, we need the Internet.  All our online services were accepted by our comrades, many thanks to them. <br><br>  But we live in the 21st century!  We have a digital economy!  What are the problems with communication, and even more so the Internet! <br><br>  So, the light was given, but the phones did not work.  Where not to go (just do not talk about Rostelecom) - the answer is one "we can not."  And yet there was a company that helped us with telephony (Habr, just do not say that I do advertising, this is a cry from the heart).  We called <a href="https://www.mango-office.ru/">Mango</a> and they instantly provided us with a virtual office.  Now every employee has a phone in the virtual office. <br>  But we are still without internet.  No one wants to provide: wait for the house to be restored.  You can wait ... <br><br>  And here we remembered <a href="https://www.yota.ru/">Yota</a> .  And we were lucky.  They offered their equipment with delivery and testing with us. <br><br>  Small inconsistencies with the delivery and equipment here with us.  We quickly set it up and our joy is boundless.  There was an excellent Internet, connected all the jobs.  And now we do not need either Rostelecom, or Infoline, and others like them.  Life has become more fun. <br>  And then we will work and hope for a bright future. <br><br>  So, if the same misfortune happens to you or you need internet and telephony urgently, then remember our experience. <br><br>  If someone waited for some technical details, they will not be. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422539/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422539/</a></p>
