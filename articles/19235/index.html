Now this whole world is yours forever.  Here she is!  This miserable planet, for which you are too beautiful.  Here is your world!  He stands at your amazing legs and whines in anticipation of a chance to please you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  This world is simple, as the process of buying cigarettes in the near stall.  It is simple as the outfits of your best friends.  He is messy and tasteless as their hairstyles.  In this world you live and the rest of the people.  People are divided into:

      A) women <br>  B) men <br><br>  Women tend to be better, smarter and more resilient than men.  This is known to all.  And those who dispute this Truth, let them go and try to give birth. <br><br>  Women of this world are divided into: <br><br>  And you <br><br>  B) Ugly <br><br>  B) Ugly people who dress like fools, act like fools and imagine too much about themselves. <br><br>  There are several types of ugly women - friends, strangers, and stars of show business (models there are all sorts, Jenifera Lopeza is thick, Angelina Jolly is old and other trash).  Girlfriends are such ugly women who know that you are beautiful and intelligent.  Unfamiliar ugly women - these are women who pretend that you do not notice and do not envy you.  Stars - all as one are ugly and in general it is not clear why there is such a hype around them.  The existence of ugly women - stars of show business tells us that in newspapers, magazines, films and television work fools who shoot all kinds of fools, and not you. <br><br>  Ugly crooners who dress like fools, act like fools and imagine themselves too much different from ugly women, even though they are aware of your superiority in everything, but they don‚Äôt admit this and vice versa - they think they are smarter and more beautiful you.  Hahaha  Rzhom all editors.  Well you have to be like that ... <br><br>  Well, that's enough about the other women.  Why talk about them a lot?  It would be something to talk about though. <br><br>  Men <br><br>  Men exist of two kinds - those with whom you met and unhappy losers.  Both of these types have one thing in common - they all want you.  You know that for sure. <br><br>  If a man says ‚ÄúGood morning,‚Äù he wants to sleep with you. <br><br>  If a man says "Sergeant Ivanov. Give your documents" - he is ready to sell all his organs for the opportunity to touch your waist. <br><br>  If a man says, ‚ÄúHow are you, forgiveness, sheep, did you manage to remove everything from your computer?‚Äù - this animal only thinks about how to get you to bed. <br><br>  If a man, completely undeservedly appointed by your boss, yells at you, face reddening about some unfulfilled work, and then dismisses you with the words ‚ÄúIf you try again to enter this office, I will kill you‚Äù that you did not give him, despite his insistent "Good morning" every day. <br><br>  If suddenly at some moment none of the men looks at you dreamily and does not try to talk to you, ask any of them ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù, Listen to any answer and tell the respondent that you are already tired of horny people like him <br><br>  If you ask no one - write to someone unfamiliar in ICQ "Hello!".  Wait for any answer and explain to him what you think about maniacs.  And you can write "Hello" and do not answer more.  Let the damn pervert suffer! <br><br>  There are exceptions among men.  For example, Johnny Depp.  AAAAAAAA.  Vizim entire editors!  He is such a duushka!  Not that all these maniacs are around.  On the other hand, it is clear to everyone and even Johnny Depp that if he suddenly sees you, he will lust after you and remain with you forever! <br><br>  There are some simple, well-known Truths: <br><br>  1) You always know better how it should be, how right and who is worth.  Anyone who argues with you - just ridiculous and stupid. <br><br>  2) You were in childhood such a hooligan! <br><br>  3) This country is not for you.  Everything is too bad here and people are angry.  Johnny Depp will come soon and take you to any other country.  Everything will be fine there and people are cultured. <br><br>  4) Those who praise their intelligence and education - in fact, just pontuyutsya.  Well, or fill in the reading of every kind of their ugly solitude ugly.  Hahaha  And what else can they do? <br><br>  5) The most advanced music in your player.  There Zemfira, Robi Williams (AAAAAA! He is such a darling !!!), DJ Dough and Ramstein!  It is very cool and fashionable.  And who thinks that there is better music, that - the rural collective farm does not understand anything in music! <br><br>  6) The waiters are fools and cattle!  They will ask for something cool to the dessert, and they carry profiteroles, when everyone knows that cool is ice cream.  Nothing!  Here comes Johnny Depp ... <br><br>  7) When you bustle at the disco - everyone stops and looks ONLY ON YOU!  And you are - oppa!  And you chatter. <br><br>  8) When you arrive at the sea and sunbathe in your AFFITIENT BATH, men are embarrassed to get up from the bedspread where they lie on their stomachs and look only at you.  And most importantly, they came with their wives. <br><br>  9) To say ‚ÄúPretica‚Äù, ‚ÄúMnu‚Äù, ‚ÄúLike Dili≈°ki‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a hacky defacchka‚Äù is cool and a sign of a sparklingly cheerful girl and crazy turkish prankster. <br><br>  10) When you walk down the street or office, men are very sorry that you can not lie on the stomach. <br><br>  11) If suddenly shooting starts nearby - is someone quarreling because of you, or you sent a couple of acquaintances to punish some idiot. <br><br>  Well, in general, and all that we wanted to tell you about the structure of this world. <br><br>  Further over four hundred pages we will talk about more pleasant things. <br><br>  We will talk about Woman category A. <br><br>  About you, sweet Special Girl. <br><br>  With admiration, love and admiration, your editors.
