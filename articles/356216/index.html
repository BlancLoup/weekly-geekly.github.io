Representatives of the department are unhappy with the fact that about 70% of new users come to pirated resources from search engines. <br><br>  As for the requirement to remove links to pages of forever blocked sites, this is not a whim of Roskomnadzor.  On October 1, amendments to the Law <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25C2%25AB%25D0%259E%25D0%25B1_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D1%2585_%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2589%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B8%25C2%25BB">"On Information"</a> came into force, according to which search engines should not include in the results of issuing links to the mentioned resources.  As it turned out, the letter of the law after October 1 was followed only by a search service Mail.ru, Yandex and Sputnik.  All other search engines show links to this portal. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As for "Yandex", then in the domestic search can not find links to banned in Russia Rutracker.org.  In those places where there should be links to sites banned by the Moscow City Court, the search engine displays a link warning that the search is filtered.

All other major search engines, including Bing, DuckDuckGo, Ask and Yahoo!  also do not filter the issue. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe law, which entered into force on October 1, 2017, provides for a new scheme for distributing lists of violating sites and their mirrors.  In August, during the development of this scheme, Roskomnadzor asked us to send suggestions on how to check the execution of federal law by search engines.  We did it.  Now there is a debugging of the new system on both sides, ‚Äùexplained the Director General of the company‚Äú Search portal ‚ÄúSputnik‚Äù Maxim Khromov. <br><br>  Khromov says that since only the system of blocking is being set up now, there are possible malfunctions in its work.  For example, single links to torrent trackers and their copies may appear in the output.  However, all of them are removed from the search results, although for the final refinement of the system still need to work. <br><br>  In turn, Vadim Ampelyonsky stated that initially appeals to search engines would be sent in the form of letters.  Then, in the case of the emergence of new ‚Äúfor life blocked‚Äù sites, the requirements will be sent automatically. <br><br>  ‚ÄúRemoving pirates from search results is a new, long-awaited practice introduced by the law that came into force.  Supervisory authority and search engines need to work it out.  Not so bad that the first deletions of pirates did not occur on October 1 or 2.  The main thing is the inevitability of the result.  We have been waiting for this law for almost two years and can wait a few more days, ‚Äùsaid the head of the Internet Video Association, Alexey Birdin. <br><br>  At the moment, 234 resources are forever blocked in Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356216/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356216/</a></p>
