  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Definition of terms in the contract for the development of the site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the process of interaction between the web-studio and the client, situations often arise when important issues within the project depend on the understanding and interpretation of technical terms.  For studio workers, the definitions of most of the terms that one has to operate in conversations with a client seem obvious, and sometimes it seems that for a client ordering a website it should be no less obvious.  However, in life a client may not know the definitions at all (just use words without understanding their meaning), interpret them in their own way, or (especially in case of disputes) use the interpretation from the first available source, including any available person who understands. " <br><br>  In due time having swallowed on this basis of problems, now the text of any our contract begins with definition of terms.  At once I will make a reservation that we used not vocabulary, not encyclopedic and not exact technical definitions, but adapted to our taste under the sauce of the legal style of presentation.  Legally, it is in fact not so important that an exact correspondence, as much as the coercion of the definition itself in the text of the document, in order to rely on it in the form in which it is presented. <br><br>  Here I quote a part of our contract, which defines the technical and production terms used in the process of developing the site (in the text of the contract and the terms of reference in particular).  I hope someone can be useful, criticism and alternative opinions are welcome.
