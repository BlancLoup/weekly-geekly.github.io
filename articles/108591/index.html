  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Startup boom: where to go?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last weekend there was a startup boom. <br><br>  On Friday, November 19, at the same time, there were <a href="http://www.greenfield-project.ru/category/sctmoscow/">Startup Crash Test</a> at the HSE in Moscow, <a href="http://nachinai.com/">‚ÄúStart‚Äù</a> at the Strogino Technopark (also in Moscow), <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/">Startup Point</a> in St. Petersburg and <a href="http://kazan.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend in Kazan</a> . <br>  On Saturday, ‚ÄúStart‚Äù and Startup Weekend continued, and <a href="http://www.greenfield-project.ru/category/poseedelki/">poSEEDelki</a> in Skolkovo were added to them. <br><br>  Last weekend, it became clear that it was difficult for a newcomer, who didn‚Äôt understand the start-up events, to understand them.  Almost impossible.  Therefore, on the eve of the <a href="http://moscow.startupweekend.org/">third Startup Weekend in Moscow</a> , Glavstart decided to survey the event market, so that everyone who once decided to enter this water would enter it in the right place and with maximum benefit for themselves.

      Below are the seven most notable events: for ideas, for prototypes, for projects.  Read, choose, come. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>About ideas.</b> <br><br>  At the moment, there are 3 known ‚Äústart-up over the weekend‚Äù formats dedicated to working on ideas and turning them into a prototype project. <br>  <a href="http://nachinai.com/"><b>1. ‚ÄúStart.com‚Äù.</b></a>  It is held often, almost once a week, as a rule, within the framework of a conference for developers.  You can express an idea, put together a team, start doing something within your own project.  The session is accompanied by lectures on the topic: who better to ask for money, how to write a business plan, etc.  They are friends with Google and the Skolkovo business school. <br>  <a href="http://hackday.ru/"><b>2. HackDay.</b></a>  Not strictly profile event organized by the St. Petersburg studio of Mikhail Kechinov.  HackDay there are about movies (movies over the weekend), about media projects in general, about clips, about the Internet and about IT.  The start-up community of the northern capital is dearly loved, are friendly with the Ingria Business Incubator.  Twice they came to Moscow and once to Yaroslavl. <br>  <a href="http://harvest.greenfield-project.ru/"><b>3. Harvest</b></a> .  The format of work on the weekend, organized by the <a href="http://www.greenfield-project.ru/">Greenfield Project</a> - great guys, walking through the market very vigorously and in the right direction.  In addition to Harvest, they hold poSEEDelki - a thematic discussion with an invited guest, during which you can express your idea and discuss it with the audience.  Greenfield is actively friends with the business incubator of the Academy of National Economy. <br><br>  <b>About prototypes.</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://moscow.startupweekend.org/">Startup Weekend</a> is also dedicated to working with prototypes and thoughtful ideas that already have a team of people ready to conquer the world - also a two-day format, but with a strong emphasis on individual work with market experts. <br>  The meaning of ‚ÄúWeekend‚Äù is to look at your project through the eyes of competent people who understand a lot of things in Internet technologies, and to find a ‚Äúsenior comrade‚Äù - a <a href="http://glavstart.ru/">mentor who will help the project not to fall apart, develop correctly and eventually find an investor</a> .  Some mentors are so addicted to trust projects that <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/glavstart/blog/107871/">they invest in them</a> . <br>  You can come to the Weekend with raw ideas, but practice shows that working with experts is more effective if the project has already been worked on (there is a detailed plan or a prototype, there are 2-3 people who are ready to do it). <br>  Therefore, if your idea is a couple of days old and you have free time on the weekend for two weeks in a row, try, for example, to go first to Harvest, which will take place this weekend.  So you will have a chance to find a team, think carefully about what exactly you are going to do, program another week, and after two weeks show your achievements to the experts at Startup Weekend. <br><br>  <b>About projects.</b> <br><br>  For finished projects that are already out or about to enter the market, there are also several formats. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.greenfield-project.ru/category/sctmoscow/"><b>Startup Crash Test</b></a> also does Greenfield.  This is a detailed debriefing and discussion of the project with the participation of experts in the face of the general public.  Each project is allocated half an hour.  The format is especially suitable for those who sincerely consider the traditional two-minute pitch to be a mockery.  :) <br>  <a href="http://startupindex.ru/"><b>Startup Index</b></a> evaluates finished projects for venture capitalists.  Assigns an investment attractiveness index.  Periodically arrange project sessions for investors.  The company belongs to the management company <a href="http://www.iqone.ru/">IQ-one</a> . <br>  <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/"><b>Startup Point</b></a> .  One of the oldest formats, the largest in RuNet project base and events for the presentation of projects that are held in many cities of Russia.  They work mainly with strategic investors.  In Moscow, the points have recently become thematic.  The nearest one will take place <a href="http://startuppoint.ru/event/32584">on November 26th and will be devoted to recruitment projects</a> . <br><br>  <b>PS:</b> Over the past six months, the market seems to have gone mad: Startup events can be found almost every day.  And no matter how different the goals of people are, who warm up this market with vigorous activity, I want to believe that very soon the number of events will grow into the quality of projects and the statement that ‚ÄúNO MARKET PROJECTS‚Äù will be a thing of the past.  Forever and ever. <br><br>  <b>PPS:</b> All the mentioned colleagues can add clarifying information about themselves in the comments to this post.  Everything about whom we did not know or have forgotten - it will be great if you tell about yourself here.  So we will collect maximum useful information for people in one post.
