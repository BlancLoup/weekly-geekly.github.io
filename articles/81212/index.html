    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In general, if briefly, then everything is very even ok.  Although it was not easy, we survived and are now actively developing.  To sum up the work that has been done in these 6 months from our last mark, the following is obtained. <br><br>  - We have implemented our application on many sites, such as: the <a href="http://roomix.ru/partners.html">site of the transfer of the "housing problem" on NTV, leading women's sites, etc.</a> <br><br>  Now in total about 4 500 people a day use our service.  Each of them creates their own rooms, looks through a large number of goods and puts them in the room.  There are already more than 2000 products in the catalog, represented by more than 30 furniture and home furnishing companies.  You can make yourself almost all possible rooms: bathroom, living room, bedroom, nursery.  We also had sponsorship sections: Eldorado is responsible for the equipment, the Window Factory provides a wide selection of windows and stained glass, and the Parquet Hall is the flooring. <br><br>  Surely many wonder what the project brings in material terms.  I will answer honestly: <br>  for the last quarter of 2009, we earned a half million rubles of income.  Not much, but it allowed us to rent a small office within the garden ring, in cozy streets near the Arbat, to develop a new functionality, rent a server and pay for other organizational expenses. <br><br>  We also <a href="http://roomix.ru/press.html">wrote</a> about us several times <a href="http://roomix.ru/press.html">in the media</a> , most of all we received visitors from an article in the Site of the Day section on the Rambler (about 30k per day), and the most useful for business (new customers and partners) was an article in Vedomosti. <br><br>  In six months, the service‚Äôs functionality has grown significantly: <br><br>  - We accelerated the application, it ceased to have a lot of RAM, so now you can safely arrange furniture for half an hour, without fear of the crashed browser :) (at first there was a problem that our 3d Papervision engine cached all user actions, clogging the memory) . <br><br>  - Worked on the quality of room renders.  As far as the engine allowed us, we improved the color rendition of the goods. <br><br>  - Added a lot of small improvements and details on the interface, a full-fledged "Help". <br><br>  - Introduced billing automatic system for our media partners and customers.  Soon the media partner will be able to look at the money earned by him in real time. <br><br>  - Made widgets for rooms.  Now everyone can insert their own room into a blog or forum.  Readers can ‚Äúfly‚Äù around the room and look at it without going to Rumiks himself. <br><br> <a href="http://mekare-co.livejournal.com/33000.html"><img src="http://roomix.ru/wid.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  - Increased the size of images in the catalog, now it‚Äôs much more convenient to choose furniture.  You can also see photos of any product in full screen to study its features in as much detail as possible. <br><br><img src="http://roomix.ru/pic.png" alt="image"><br><br>  - We are finishing the translation of the application into other languages ‚Äã‚Äãand are now waiting for the launch of the service in Ukraine and Eastern Europe ( <a href="http://roomix3d.com/">http://roomix3d.com/</a> ) <br><br>  What are your plans? <br><br>  We have many more plans, for example: <br><br>  - the ability to put a pillow on the sofa and put a vase on the table; <br><br>  - complete processing of the appearance and design of the resource with changes in the work areas (we want to increase the space allocated to the catalog so that you can view more products. What do you think about this?); <br><br>  - full transition to the automation of the service (so that everyone can connect a 3D scheduler to the site); <br><br>  Thank you for giving a lot of useful feedback last time, this allows us to develop further, understanding exactly what the audience needs.  We are pleased to answer questions about the project. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81212/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81212/</a></p>
