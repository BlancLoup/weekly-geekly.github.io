      Two robots are already at the station - this is Bumble and Honey, and in July, the third robot, Queen, is expected to arrive on the ISS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0k/4y/vk/0k4yvkd9376fisftfitzq3u4cjy.jpeg"><br><br>  Their names are not so easily associated with miniature and have a "bee" disposition. <br><br>  These are specially designed small-autonomous robots designed and created by <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/astrobee">NASA at the Ames research center</a> , which are designed to work in zero gravity inside the MKS modules. They should, like bees, take on part of the routine space tasks and free the ISS crew from simple but frequent actions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x-/_8/v9/x-_8v9ar7ui7xu5uwcj8vilavvc.jpeg"><br><br>  Thus, the Astrobee project is a free-flying system from a complex of robots, the main purpose of which is to test small-sized automated platforms under weightless conditions with the acquisition and analysis of data in real conditions and the possibility of further upgrading and improving the software and functions of robots to perform current and new tasks on the ISS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/et/i9/nj/eti9njw1denx9lciwlk97yf3vh8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pz/y3/iq/pzy3iqyzejkhtn8yxfymzdl6lem.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/de/hm/0f/dehm0fprudhypmnhmjsadl1m76g.jpeg"><br><br>  <u>Characteristics of the Astrobee project robots:</u> <br><br>  - the size of one robot - 30x30x30 centimeters (1x1x1 foot); <br><br>  - the body of the robot is covered with soft material to minimize possible damage if you strike any object or element on the ISS; <br><br>  - part of the edges of the robot is designed to work with small loads, there is even a system for grabbing and fixing objects with a folding manipulator so that the robot can hold and safely move an object from one end of the station to the other, the robot can also fix its position with this grab need, clinging to the handrails or other elements of the ISS; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zg/5l/ov/zg5lovkk1iq1u9dzx-1lmk7i5dg.png"><br><br>  - robots have a separate external charging station, which serves to charge the batteries of the robots and to retrieve telemetry data; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ta/9u/f7/ta9uf7q2kvjyo3h_ja2lexmsnpa.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tp/i6/g1/tpi6g15m2gfi2cboah4umgpevuy.jpeg"><br><br>  - robots can move only inside the ISS in zero gravity conditions only if there is an atmosphere in the working module with the robot, their reactive system uses station air for movement; <br><br>  - each robot has its own computerized control system for the onboard fan system, which allows air to be captured and ejected through 12 nozzles in the direction opposite to the intended motion vector, which allows the robot to move in any direction and fly freely on the ISS under weightless conditions; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g-/1s/v1/g-1sv1wnrtioevuzhbeh0skbnge.png"><br><br>  - the robot's fans are located behind a special protective wall on the edges of its cube; <br><br>  - the computer system of the robot works on Linux, and the module that is responsible for working with objects and their movement works on the basis of Android, which allows you to quickly expand the functionality of the system if necessary; <br><br>  - <a href="https://github.com/nasa/astrobee">link to the githaba repository</a> with Astrobee software. <br><br>  - each robot has on board: a main navigation camera with a field of view of 116 ¬∞, several HD cameras with autofocus that can transmit information from the ISS to Earth in real time, and its onboard camera CamBoard Pico Flexx allows the robot to recognize objects and obstacles from a distance of four meters; <br><br>  - <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/space-robots/nasa-launching-astrobee-robots-to-iss-tomorrow">each robot has an optical detector</a> to determine the speed and emergency execution of the stop procedure; <br><br>  - modes of operation of robots: autonomous, they can also be controlled remotely, it is safe to pick up, put on charge if necessary, turn them off. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dd/ou/ir/ddouircxucewib75-vmnoy7k_fi.jpeg"><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g8WYaaGf2f8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <u>Functions of robots of the Astrobee project:</u> <br><br>  - the main task of the robots is to assist the crew on the ISS, to perform a number of routine tasks so that the staff can focus on more important tasks (carrying out experiments and various studies); <br><br>  - carry out an inventory, document experiments, check the ISS system and move cargo, objects and tools through the narrow corridors of the station and between modules; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u8/1s/3o/u81s3ov1vxf6rgq1bl11kjqfa3c.png"><br><br>  - perform maintenance of the MKS modules when there are no personnel in them or in places where the crew cannot reach quickly; <br><br>  - to monitor the operation of the systems and sensors of the ISS; <br><br>  - monitor air quality, analyze the level of carbon dioxide concentration in different locations of the ISS as often as necessary. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cx/0q/v4/cx0qv4gvb4_ymo1tqv3bbrq9yfu.jpeg"><br><br>  <u>The story of the appearance of the Astrobee robots on the ISS:</u> <br><br>  - the charging station was delivered onboard the ISS on November 17, 2018 and was installed on February 15, 2019;
