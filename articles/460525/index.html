The report will be useful for testers who are beginning to implement automated testing, developers who can not bring themselves to write tests, and for everyone who starts to build CI / CD. <br>  <b>About the speaker:</b> Alexander is friends with developers and does everything to make them comfortable to write code.  So comfortable that the code is obtained almost without bugs. <br><br>  20:10 - 20:30 - Coffee, pizza and chat <br><br>  <b>20:30 - 21:20 - ‚ÄúIDEA plug-ins guarding automation‚Äù (Artyom Eroshenko, QametaSoftware)</b> <br>  Being the team leader of several test automation teams, I often have to deal with refactoring the autotest code and its markup.  When developing plug-ins for IDEA, I paid attention to the API, which allows you to change the code of your project.  The advantage of this API is that we know everything about the code with which we work: all uses of variables, classes, annotation signature, and so on.  From the report we learn about the work of this API and see several examples of its use. <br>  <b>About the speaker:</b> Artyom has been automating the testing of web applications for more than 8 years.  During this time, he worked in different teams and in different roles: testing automator, testing tool development team manager, testing automation team leader.  Artyom has extensive experience with popular tools (Selenium, HtmlElements, Allure, Jenkins).  Programs mainly in Java, Groovy. <br><br>  21:20 - 21:40 - DINS office tour <br><br>  ‚Üí We will meet on July 24 at 19:30 in our office (St. Petersburg, Staro-Petergofsky, 19). <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://dins.timepad.ru/event/1018781/%3Futm_refcode%3D85cc19e02504f51e1d44ca92982dcb70076c2a1e">To participate in the meeting and connect to the broadcast you need to register.</a> <br><br><br><h2>  JavaScript EVENING: talking about static typing, TypeScript and ReasonML </h2><br>  19.00 - 19.30 - Collection of guests and coffee <br><br>  <b>19:30 - 20:20 - ‚ÄúType it!‚Äù (Alexander Feoktistov, Yandex.Market)</b> <br>  There are developers familiar only with dynamically-typed languages ‚Äã‚Äã- PHP, Python, JavaScript, etc.  Alexander will inspire us with his TypeScript examples, so that we also try static typing.  After all, static typing gives us a lot of useful ... <br>  The report will be interesting to both novice front-end developers and more experienced ones. <br>  <b>About the speaker:</b> in his life, Alexander met a lot of software development technologies: he got acquainted with Pascal / Delphi at school, at the university he plunged into C ++ for scientific computing, at his first job he riveted the C ++ / WinAPI cookie makers and learned Java.  The turning point was an acquaintance with the world of the front end, which first brought down Alexander Vanilla JS, then threw jQuery, hit the XSLT reefs, and finally, in a swirling whirlpool, drowned in Angular and React. <br><br>  20:20 - 20:40 - Coffee, pizza and chat <br><br>  <b>20:40 - 21:20 - ‚ÄúReasonML: Hindley-Milner on the front end‚Äù (Anton Tuzhik, SEMrush)</b> <br>  Browsers and web technologies are not standing still.  Every year more and more web applications are created, they become more complicated, and the code base becomes larger.  In such conditions, difficulties often arise with the dynamic weak typing of the main language of web development JavaScript.  This is a big problem.  The emergence of tools such as TypeScript, Flow js, Elm, ReasonML just confirms this.  In his report, Anton will tell you what ReasonML is, what ‚Äúchips‚Äù it has, how it compiles in JS and interacts with it, how it helps to solve the problem of the increasing complexity of interface development.  A report for those who are interested in new technologies.  And also for those who want to increase the reliability of their code base. <br>  <b>About the speaker:</b> Anton is developing interfaces.  In his free time he studies new things, sometimes he gets to open source projects.  Recently interested in typing. <br><br>  21:20 - 21:40 - DINS office tour <br><br>  ‚Üí We meet on July 31 at 19:30 in our office (St. Petersburg, Staro-Petergofsky, 19). <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://dins.timepad.ru/event/1021457/%3Futm_refcode%3D041dbeb03c0f83ff82393e03b11e0a3945938224">To participate and connect to the broadcast you need to register.</a> <br><br><h2>  DINS IT EVENING </h2><br>  We regularly hold open meetings bringing together technical specialists from different companies.
