  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My way to web development ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I would like to talk about how I began my long journey in creating websites.  So, it all started about 3 years ago, when I first had the opportunity to access the Internet from my own computer at any time convenient for me.  True, then it was only a modem for 3000 rubles !!!  As I was advised - the best and fast ... Yeah ... Then 56 kbit / s seemed to be the ultimate dream.  Well, that's exactly when it all began.  I immediately plunged into this world of endless possibilities.  I immediately felt that I had the potential that requires something more than just to climb the pages in search of porn pictures or reading bashorga.  And I began to search, read, learn.  It seems that it was already sooo long ago, so of course I don‚Äôt remember all the subtleties and trifles.  But I still try: <br><br>  <b>Resource number 1.</b>  My first steps were searching for a place to host my first site.  This is not a big problem.  ‚ÄúNarod.ru‚Äù of Yandex was then a very common hosting, and I, without hesitation, registered my site.  The name was - it is more banal not to think up: IMIAFAMILIYA.narod.ru.  It is clear that there could be no talk of any particular name, because then I still had no idea what exactly I would be posting on it, and would I even be at all ... <br>  After this began the period of creating the long-awaited website.  I was obsessed with software, etc.  and I decided to devote my resource to him ... And I started banging Vareznik ... I didn‚Äôt understand absolutely nothing in HTML, so I went on about the first program to create pages.  She became a small <b>Office Publisher</b> .  So, a couple of months later I received 10 pages of dirty HTML with 10-15 programs connected by an incomprehensible system of hyperlinks (I still don‚Äôt know how the publisher encoded what I drew visually).  The resource was quickly forgotten and removed from the system a long time ago ... Sad, isn't it?  :) Open, it was necessary to immediately abandon WYSIWYG.  Perhaps now it would be a genius coder-coder ... <br><br>  <b>Resources "version 2.0":</b> Further more, and I wanted something more serious than a static HTML curve on a wooden hosting.  But, unfortunately, I still did not dare to code.  And so, a couple of years ago, I began to deal with systems that offered to create free sites on their hosting, where you immediately get a ready-made template site.  Naturally, <b>UCOZ</b> was in the lead.  I immediately created my yuznik under the straightforward name supersait.my1.ru.  I began to progress, I began to realize that not a single soul of its own accord would enter the resource with the address initials.  And I chose a very universal name, which later, of course, did not justify itself.  Then it was a stir!  Dynamic site!  A bunch of pages!  Forum!  I even learned to insert banners and counters on the pages ... But, over time, this was forgotten ... <br>  Another common system of this type was called MyBB, SpyBB ... well, and many more analogues.  In general, creating free forums on the <b>phpBB</b> engine.  A resource was created on the domain * .informe.com, which even became visited !!!  Yes, imagine my joy when on this forum 20 people registered for the first 10 days !!!  True, at that time I did not understand that there was little use from my friends on the forum and the forum had already died a month later.  But, oddly enough, for more than a year, and maybe even two, it still lies on the hosting ...

      <b>Resources "version 3.0":</b> And here I entered adult life ... I began to try, test, learn content management systems <b>CMS</b> and distributions of various forums.  Of course, there was a need to find a good free hosting with all the bells and whistles, and most importantly with PHP and MySQL.  I tried so many of them that now I will not even try to remember them.  I think that knowledgeable people will understand perfectly well which Russian free hosting sites were the most popular a year and a half ago.  I probably tried all the free CMS and forums.  All this was very interesting and in principle understandable, but still there was no good idea ... And all this was only as a training.  I graduated from school and went to college.  And then I had an idea.  I wanted to do something for school.  I decided that the site was useless, but the forum would be fine.  The <b>SMF</b> system was chosen and I started tinkering.  First, the site was made on the hosting <b>ONEP.RU</b> ... I even spent a small advertising campaign.  Three announcements were brought to the school, which we were asked to put up near the timetable, in the staff room or anywhere else.  After a week or two, there were already enough people on the forum.  Even a couple of teachers and about a dozen graduates 5 years old and more!  I was very glad!  But then the problems with hosting started, and I moved the forum to <b>CROE.NET</b> .  And yet, having typed about 1000 messages, the forum stalled.  I despaired and stepped back from the site building ... I went a year of freelancing ...  Pretty successful, but rather unstable ... <br><br>  <b>New release!</b>  Only a couple of months ago I matured to start from scratch, typeset on a notebook, and not some kind of hanging.  And I got into the online encyclopedia.  And I found for myself a lot of discoveries, both good and not so ... Let's start with the "not so", which in principle are also rather good.  I realized that learning <b>HTML</b> in modern design is impossible without parallel learning of <b>CSS</b> , I realized that <b>PHP is</b> not in any gate without <b>MySQL</b> .  And I realized that all beauty lies precisely in the harmony of HTML / CSS with PHP / MySQL.  And when you connect <b>AJAX</b> , etc.  we can already achieve anything ... I even had to learn how to photoshop, because  site without design also can not exist.  And I made a resource for a month, quite good, in my opinion, for the first samopisny site.  At the moment he is at <a href="http://www.linkmoney.dax.ru/">linkmoney.dax.ru</a> .  On it, I began to study methods of optimization and promotion ... Without investing a penny in it (this is my principle at the moment), I began to register it in directories and enter in forums.  Well, there‚Äôs absolutely no optimizer out of me at the moment, but 10 unique per day is still something. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> This is only the beginning of my journey.  Now I have high-speed unlimited Internet, enough free time and growing exponentially with knowledge.  Moreover, in the near future, my principle will be abolished, and I will allow myself to invest a certain amount in order to acquire a domain, good hosting, and perhaps even spend promotion.  So, I wish you good luck, and of course you too!  ;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/50655/">https://habr.com/ru/post/50655/</a></p>
