Maybe that's why its syntax is complicated, and errors are frequent.  However, the possibilities of JS are impressive and still impressive.  For 20+ years, JS has acquired libraries, has become a very beautiful and almost completely convenient language, which "speak" thousands of developers around the world.  What is not a reason to gather every year and remember how much good Ike did?  But at the same time fun and to spend time with benefits? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u1/y5/la/u1y5lanaiqsm6qvfe72lipwsfr0.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa global holiday <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jsdevday/">JavaScript Developer Day</a> belongs to an experienced developer from Minsk <b>Dmitry Vorobyu</b> - the leader of the external JavaScript community and Front-end developers <a href="https://rollingscopes.com/">The Rolling Scopes</a> .  In addition, Dmitry organized a conference and Rolling Scopes School, as well as EPAM JSLAB Minsk. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/913/82f/fc9/91382ffc9b4e5f5503899f517e57159c.jpg" alt="image">

      A bit of magic in the form of social networks, word of mouth and the help of HR specialist <b>Victoria Kosheleva</b> - and global JavaScript Day was celebrated in 14 EPAM offices in Belarus, Russia, Poland and Ukraine.  It's like the first time in the world to celebrate International Women's Day or World Writer's Day! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b37/8b8/5e0/b378b85e07cc87a3013c2ef315d44678.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúSomehow the children came up to me and said that they were going to celebrate St. Patrick's Day at school and needed to put on something green,‚Äù recalls Dmitry Vorobey.  - And then a thought flashed: why JS-developers do not have their own holiday and their own symbolism? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fd/cca/5a0/9fdcca5a091bb206cc77c388858f3ae3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And here we have it all.  Now the holiday is associated with yellow and orange colors, and its symbols are spider monkey, rhino, mocha &amp; bananas.  Spider Monkey and Rhino are known to all JS engineers.  In addition, the language is rich in so-called <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat">WAT-features</a> , because of which the way a novice JS developer looks like wandering in the wild jungle.  The theme was proposed and drawn by a designer from Kiev, <b>Kirill Shvedov</b> . ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba7/48c/c11/ba748cc110d363d2f4adef11240e5cfa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>How exactly did EPAM JavaScript Day go in different locations?</i> <br><br>  Let's start from Minsk, where in February one of the largest annual JS conferences died down - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D2A9jOrbpizU">The Rolling Scopes</a> , which was attended by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D2A9jOrbpizU">over 1,000 people</a> .  There are about a dozen IT communities in Minsk, so the event was not supposed to disappoint.  The organization was taken over by Pavel Yukhnovich, <b>Vladimir Galushko</b> and <b>Olga Malinovskaya</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0f/ece/4eb/d0fece4eb47b7b19fbfa784851e2fb5b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Pavel Yukhnovich</b> : <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe debut JavaScript Developer Day Quiz turned out to be really unique - in the format of a meeting similar to the pub quiz, but not on the subject of geography, politics or history, as in Brainwind, but on the theme of Front-end and JavaScript. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a04/a2d/afa/a04a2dafad8a5a4e37249de6bb4c7be6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  If people are involved, for example, in FrontSpot Tech Talks, to listen to or talk about serious things from the world of web development, then JavaScript Day Quiz is a fan, networking and a good way to unload the brain.  We had teams of two types: consisting of both friends and strangers.  But the charm of the community is just to find friends by interest, discuss hot topics and learn something new. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cdd/4b3/4de/cdd4b34def932b0e7f83ce52f8f07cf3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In each location - from Gdansk to Saratov - the number of people willing to participate exceeded the ability to accommodate everyone.  And, of course, Minsk was no exception - here we decided to divide the event into two streams.  The first is in the place where our guys from the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/beerjsminsk/">BeerJS Minsk</a> community usually gather.  The vacancies here quickly ended: more than 100 engineers were eager to participate in the quiz.  And the second stream - for <a href="https://school.rollingscopes.com/">RS School</a> students - was held in Imaguru startup hub, where <a href="https://rollingscopes.com/">The Rolling Scopes</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/webnotbombs/">Web Not Bombs</a> communities often take place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/05f/7e5/ddd/05f7e5ddd6d30c649157c39187e3f8cc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  By the way, there are a lot of internal and external communities in Minsk.  For example, FrontSpot-community pleases engineers with technical currents in different locations.  This year, the FrontSpot-hakaton was held for everyone, the hundredth technical current died down, and the weekly Front-end Digest became a favorite constant reading piece for JS-developers, and this is only the beginning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b6/a2b/41d/2b6a2b41d84aaf3f6d0704c2ab05291a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But, as they say, not Front-end one!  There is also <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/dsgnspot/about/">Design Design</a> community, where interesting technical currents and workshops often take place, and where UX / UI specialists and hardcore JS developers can learn a lot of new and interesting things. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d9a/98d/062/d9a98d062545cef1753571dca70f4d3c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  According to <b>Vasily Brutsky</b> , a Brest community activist of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/itsharkpro/">It Shark Pro</a> , ‚Äú9 teams, 45 engineers, took part in the Brest Pub Quiz.  People have been actively registering in recent days!  The pub-quiz itself was conducted by two hosts, <b>Vladimir Demin</b> and <b>Alexander</b> Kovalenko, while the judges were <b>Alexander Orgish</b> and <b>Vasily Brutsky</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/446/cd8/ddf/446cd8ddf469fb2fd70c90d6850f5cb7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We managed to celebrate the holiday of the language of JavaScript with a soul, and most importantly - we managed to collect so many caring professionals who are bored with living on the principle of 'work - home.'  Questions on various topics included our brain after the work week, and even motivated someone to spend the weekend reading the documentation.  A competition for the best joke and the best explanation of complex issues was announced.  The Undefined team won, for which she received memorable prizes. ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64d/142/806/64d14280699935d2961c8223e320348d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  People-manager <b>Irina Barchuk</b> from Vinnitsa said that their JavaScript Developer Day was a great success: ‚ÄúFor our meeting, we chose Cherdak creative space with a panoramic view of the river and the city.  Since the development of the JS community for our office is a priority, we set out to attract more external guests.  50 experienced JS-engineers from Vinnitsa responded.  We guessed the questions very much, and 3 hours just flew by.  After awarding the winners, the discussion was actively continued.  Great initiative! ‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/21e/be0/65c/21ebe065c866496bfef79cb5daccad2c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To get acquainted with the leaders of Rolling Scopes personally, ask your questions, post a part of the community or learn more about the movement of expert communities in Belarus, come to the <b><a href="https://epa.ms/corpblog-article-JS-day-habra">EPAM Software Engineering Conference</a></b> - the first EPAM conference open to outside audiences.  2 of 7 streams with reports were given to the community, the guys actively participated in the formation of a common agenda.  In addition to community reports, organizing Textures Spots (tech-exhibition spaces) are organized - zones with master classes, thematic booths and networking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/64d/142/806/64d14280699935d2961c8223e320348d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  To hold an event in your location, you can use the <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wzRY1B-AIX9Gqjc8xHIv8tFbdQiDvrDF">materials of the pub quiz</a> prepared by The Rolling Scopes team. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1e0/024/659/1e002465907612ee84156cd4704028d5.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420503/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420503/</a></p>
