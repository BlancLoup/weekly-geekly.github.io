      <b>Cognitive Anatomy of Languages ‚Äã‚Äãin iTunes</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174433/">Rus</a> <br>  Those who faced with the localization of ios applications in different languages, could not help but pay attention to all the magnificent variety of language settings in the Itunes Store and in Itunes Connect.  There are so many of them that at once you will not understand where, what, and in what language it will be displayed.  With this post, I will try to conduct those who are interested in the inexperienced through language measurements of the not always clear and convenient iTunes farm. <br><br>  <b>Aerobia - the first national sports tracker</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/aerobia/blog/173925/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5bf/fbb/148/5bffbb148caa9c0e35f75ece4eca2b1a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The situation in Russia is very bad with a massive, even aerobic sport, and no one wanted to get involved in a laborious, expensive and very long development.  Many factors had to coincide in order to decide on this.  But our mosaic has developed.  That's why we made the FIRST NATIONAL SPORTS TRACKER of domestic production. <br><br>  <b>"Tongue twisters".</b>  <b>Part 1: From idea to design</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/osc/blog/174523/">Rus</a> <br>  Let's take a look at the stages of creating our latest application - ‚Äútongues on a cardboard‚Äù with us. <br><br>  <b>IPhone has more vulnerabilities than Android, BlackBerry and Windows Phone combined</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/174401/">Rus</a> <br>  When it comes to mobile security, we most often discuss Android with its viruses and trojans, living mostly outside the Google Play Store.  However, the new SourceFire study easily showed that the iPhone has more security problems than Android, BlackBerry, and Windows Phone combined. <br><br><h4>  Android </h4><br><br>  <b>Using drivers from the Android application</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174077/">Rus</a> <br>  Route gives almost absolute power over the Android device.  Today I will tell you how to get even more inclined to programming and the desire to explore the system on your device. <br><br>  <b>App Publish: publication in 130+ stores for Android</b> <br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/27/inmobi-launches-app-publish-an-android-app-distribution-platform-covering-hundreds-of-stores-puts-its-metaflow-acquisition-to-work/">Eng</a> / <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/app-publish.html">Rus</a> <br>  InMobi mobile advertising network has taken another step towards becoming a universal tool for meeting the needs of application developers.  She launched the App Publish, a distribution platform for Android applications, which will allow developers to publish their free, paid, or freemium applications at many different Android application stores at once.  The free App Publish offers access to approximately 130 app stores around the world, and according to Charles MacLeod, InMobi's director of business development, they will add new ones, about one in a week. <br><br>  <b>New Facebook home on Android: April 4</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/174667/">Rus</a> <br>  Facebook on April 4 invited the press to an event at its headquarters, which is called ‚ÄúCome See Our New Home On Android‚Äù (‚ÄúCome and see our new Home on Android‚Äù). <br><br><h4>  Windows phone </h4><br><br>  <b>New tools for developing games on Windows Phone</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/174583/">Rus</a> <br>  At the GDC conference in San Francisco, a number of announcements were made about new tools for developing games on the Microsoft platform.  Now, in addition to existing tools such as DirectX, developers can use Unity 3D, Marmalade, Havok. <br><br><h4>  Blackberry </h4><br><br>  <b>BlackBerry 10: Android is better than Android?</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174533/">Rus</a> <br><img src="http://cdn-static.zdnet.com/i/r/story/70/00/012967/droidsheldon-vsbb10wheaton-460-v1-460x416.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The more I think about it, the more I feel a sense of d√©j√†-vu.  In fact, this was 20 years ago.  The vendor who last tried to do this was IBM with its OS / 2 2.0 operating system.  For me, this is like salt on the wound, and they will certainly criticize me, but since this battle between Microsoft and IBM has long been over, I will continue. <br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br><br>  <b>Havok Announces Project Anarchy: Free Cross-Platform 3D Engine</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2013/03/26/havok-project-anarchy-mobile-engine/">Eng</a> / <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/havok-project-anarchy.html">Rus</a> <br>  Havok at GDC announced Project Anarchy - a new cross-platform mobile 3D engine with its physics, animation and AI.

The authors of the project position it as a universal tool, a kind of analog cocos2d for 3D games.  To start writing on GamePlay 3D you do not need to have a deep knowledge of OpenGL, GLSL or 3D graphics math, but we all understand that to achieve a good result you cannot get away from it. <br><br>  <b>Google launches Universal Analytics</b> <br>  <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/22/google-opens-universal-analytics-beta-to-all-creates-a-single-analytics-platform-for-tracking-online-and-offline-interactions/">Eng</a> / <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/google-universal-analytics.html">Rus</a> <br>  Last October, Google announced a limited beta version of Universal Analytics, its attempt to introduce new features into Google Analytics: cross-platform analytics, mobile apps analytics, and the ability to use data from offline sources.

At GDC 2013, YouTube announced the release of new APIs, which, being embedded in the game, will allow broadcasting the game stream to its channel. <br><br>  <b>Successful mobile art: puzzle of small parts</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174727/">Rus</a> <br>  Do not stop talking about what makes the mobile game a hit.  In this article we want to share our thoughts on the role of art in this issue.  In our opinion, the set of all factors listed below is important for the success of the game. <br><br>  <b>Graphic Password Vulnerability</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174773/">Rus</a> <br>  Background: my wife constantly strives to somehow screw me up: set the alarm clock at 3 am, change the ringtone, take down the synchronization settings, delete my SMS and then prove that she did not say that.  Joking as a joke, but at some point I decided: ‚ÄúEnough!‚Äù - and put the graphic password on my android. <br><br>  <b>Yodo1: do not translate your applications into Chinese</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/Yodo1%2Bnews/news.asp%3Fc%3D49639">Eng</a> / <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/yodo1-ne-nado-perevodit-svoi-prilojeniya-na-kitayskiy.html">Rus</a> <br>  ‚ÄúNone of the systems that Western developers rely on - be it advertising, payments, opening applications or distribution - is unavailable in China,‚Äù said Yodo1 head of Henry Fong at GDC 2013.  While the Chinese market remains a mystery to many Western developers, its size means that it is impossible to ignore. <br><br><h5>  Security </h5><br><br>  <b>A person among 1,500,000 users of mobile communication can be identified only by 4 points in time and space</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174221/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1b0/1f8/f87/1b01f8f873e84c06c25d54b2885b8341.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Every day, each of us is in the same places at about the same time - home, work, gym, shop, house again ... Our daily route is quite stable and at the same time unique.  A joint study of American and Belgian scientists has shown that its degree of uniqueness is much higher than can be expected. <br><br><h4>  Money </h4><br><br>  <b>Google has created a calculator to calculate the value of the mobile world</b> <br>  <a href="http://mashable.com/2013/03/26/google-mobile-roi/">Eng</a> / <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/google-full-value-of-mobile-calculator.html">Rus</a> <br>  Full Value of Mobile Calculator (calculator of all value of the mobile) is created so that marketers can monitor calls, applications, internal sales, mobile site visits and activity on different devices and sales due to all this. <br><br>  <b>Facebook has improved mobile ad targeting</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/facebook-uluchshil-targetirovanie-mobilnoy-reklamyi.html">Rus</a> <br>  The company Facebook has announced some improvements in the mobile app install ads, launched last fall.

To date, the Android version is still in development.  The program helps users to quickly search for news on topics of interest to them and uses some know-how and artificial intelligence to compress an arbitrary article in a resume of up to 400 characters and selects suitable and attractive pictures to design on the screen of a mobile device. <br><br>  <b>The success of Candy Crush Saga in cross-platform and updates</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/articles/applications/candy-crush-saga-uspeh.html">Rus</a> <br>  The entire developer community has become interested in how Candy Crush Saga so quickly achieved success.
