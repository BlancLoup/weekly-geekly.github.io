  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Privatbank has you,%% username!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Already 5 years I use Webmoney, both for personal purposes, and for settlements with customers / performers. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/410/5ca/a45/4105caa453aab362b97b0f020d5a1872.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  I changed WMID a couple of times, due to the safe loss of access to the old, I‚Äôve withdrawn funds more than one hundred times, both through dealers and UkrGarant ( <a href="https://banking.ukrgarant.com/">https://banking.ukrgarant.com/</a> ), the information on the guarantor can be viewed <a href="http://ukrgarant.com/">http: //ukrgarant.com/</a> <br>  Through UkrGarant I bring to the debit card of PrivatBank.  Usually during the day the money is already on it, but lately transfers have begun to linger to one and a half or two.  Unpleasant, but not critical. <br><br>  But it is, nevertheless, about the last attempt to withdraw.  So, 10.02 (at the moment already 6 days ago) once again sent money to the card.  In the reports of UkrGarant, there is great fun "Sent to the bank 02/10/2010 15:29". <br>  11.02 in the morning I understood that there was no SMS about enrollment to the card.  Well, it happens, billing is buggy.  However, at the ATM, the card states that there is no such money on it either.  Ok, I think, linger. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  <b>After the publication of the topic, the manager Privat 24 contacted me, promised to solve the issue tomorrow.</b>  <b>We wait</b> <br>  <b>UPD2.</b>  <b>Taki issue was resolved and the money came to the card.</b>  <b>Quickly, it is a pity that the issue was resolved in not quite standard ways.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you, probably, already understood from the fact of existence of this topic, money did not appear neither 11.02, nor 12.02.  I call in the evening 12.02 to the support service in order to find out where the money is hanging and whether there is such a transaction in principle.  A very ‚Äúpolite‚Äù young man tried to send me to the sender in the <s>forest</s> for 5 minutes, but in the end I persuaded him to check the availability of this transaction.  He asked for the card number, said to wait on the line and turned on the music.  After 2 minutes of listening to music, the call ended.  Not on my side, and.

      Ok, I call on the same day again, the situation repeats.  At the weekend was too busy, no longer got support.  On Monday, February 15, there is still no money.  I call support.  The first time was sent to the sender of the transfer.  OK.  I call in Ukrgarant, I specify.  I get the answer that the money in the bank, and if they did not get there, then would come back.  There is no reason to trust them - the amount is too insignificant compared to normal withdrawal amounts, but with PrivatBank there are already accounts. <br><br>  I call customer support again.  The girl got very polite, listened to me carefully and ... said that there was no transaction in the system at all.  And it was not.  She advised me to contact the office that issued this card in order to search for money (gut, and what about the support service, then?).  But, nevertheless, thanks to her for bringing clarity. <br><br>  I go to the office where a girl with a level of professionalism that goes far below zero declares to me that they do not work with WebMoney (yeah, and all the previous dozens of times have not worked).  I barely explained to her that, in fact, it was a regular payment from one bank to my account in another.  When I tell her the amount, she, looking at me very surprised, asks: "Is it in dollars?"  I say ‚ÄúNo, in hryvnia.  Card after the hryvnia.  The girl rounded her eyes even more and asked: ‚ÄúHow did you send the webmoney to the hryvnia?‚Äù <br><br>  Well, it was a lyrical digression.  The result of communication in the department: my money is not in the bank. <br><br>  I called Ukrgarant, found out the payment details, tomorrow I will still understand. <br><br>  Yesterday I connected the output to the card of another bank.  With whom I have never had problems, and which partner has been using for a long time for withdrawal.  Money on the account within 15 minutes, and on the card within 2 hours.  Maybe even a sigh of relief. <br><br>  I recommend everyone not to use the services of a bank where they cannot find your operation during the week. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84478/</a></p>
