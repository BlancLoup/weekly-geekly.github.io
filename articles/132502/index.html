  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tea Making Machine for Arduino</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, dear habrazhiteli.  I decided to share with you my hand-made article, and at the same time improve my mood.  Have you ever wondered why there are coffee makers in almost every home, and not everyone can boast a machine for instant glass of tea?  Details of the manufacture of several useless simple apparatus for brewing tea under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Firstly, I have an Arduino on my shelf, or rather its compatible analogue of Freeduino.  I think there is no need to describe it. <br><br>  Secondly, there were a lot of pleasant little things lying around, namely, a servo drive that resembles this one in size: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d19/aa5/a29/d19aa5a29de5eb4b852ce3a29a0db3fc.jpg">

      At first there was an idea to assemble a manipulator and play with it, but from scrap materials there was only cardboard.  Somewhere in the middle of the assembly process, it became clear that it was better to postpone the assembly for a while until the plastic for making beams appeared.  Anyway, it would not have been possible to make a normal manipulator of cardboard and screeds in half an hour.  I forgot to say that the glue was not at hand, and I didn‚Äôt really want to glue anything at all, so absolutely everything was fastened with ties, which the neighbor in the hostel bought in large quantities. <br><br>  Left cardboard beam, bolted ties to the servo.  Screw it so well that it was a pity to break.  I decided to attach it to a non-working iron.  To stand upright and could wave.  What for?  I do not know. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/47f/308/de1/47f308de19596e4b58e31f5c69ff2d8a.jpg"><br><br>  During the next tea party, it dawned on me that the movements of the beams were great, in order to dunk a tea bag instead of me!  Even one degree of freedom is enough to brew tea perfectly and throw the bag straight into the urn.  Having finished my tea, I ran to fix the iron on the stand.  The cracked lid from the Ashanov Universal Box became a support.  It can already be seen in the picture above. <br><br>  A simple tea cooking algorithm was invented: <br><br><ol><li>  We are waiting for the user to hang the bag, put a mug of boiling water and confirm its acceptance by pressing the button </li><li>  Slowly we bathe the bag in the circle by swinging the beam. </li><li>  Slowly take out the bag </li><li>  Making a sudden movement of the beam, due to which the bag flies into the urn, which is located on the other side of the iron </li><li>  Ready!  Tea!  Eagle! </li></ol><br><br>  Since the toy is unlikely to live for more than a month, it was decided not to solder anything, but to collect everything on the breadboard, connecting all the twisted pair wires.  The build lasted about 15 minutes. <br><br>  During the assembly came up with the idea that tea is strong and not very.  I decided to fasten the rheostat, which is set the number of dives bag.  Well, two LEDs for debugging and visibility of the mode of operation, waiting and cooking.  It turned out the scheme: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a5a/534/976/a5a534976e64b3d1b5e3490169cdc6d1.png"><br><br>  It became too lazy to look for current-limiting resistors for LEDs.  I decided to simply apply for them with a SHIM of less than 5 volts and hope for good luck. <br><br>  The button closes 2 pins to ground, since it is initially pulled by the internal resistor of the controller to the supply voltage and has a value of HIGH when reading. <br><br>  Servodvu enough general power Arduino, since he is alone here gluttonous.  As a result, the entire device works quietly from USB, but in general from any five volts that can be found in the room. <br><br>  Never experienced such euphoria from a glass of tea!  Just for the sake of this feeling it was worth collecting this thing.  You can collect those who are just acquainted with microcontrollers or the Arduino platform. <br><br>  Finally, a few photos and, of course, video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cac/829/85c/cac82985c90490f8843e0b3aae13a082.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea7/4ab/d63/ea74abd636b850caa372814499a71c4f.jpg"><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3najBMJ2sM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhgnls80wMrjy1Eo97mhapwipV5qw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132502/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132502/</a></p>
