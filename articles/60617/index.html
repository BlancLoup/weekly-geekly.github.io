  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Now - startup era, I - a startup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Stop rotting in cabinets soaked with corporate rules.  Today is the era of the Internet and technology.  Today you can, having gathered a small company of odnodumtsev in the garage, to compete, press the IT magnate, or maybe even just release a good, high-quality product that people will use. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  How it all sounds good, and how it all really is not easy.  The second (in my opinion) step in the life phase of a startup is a team.  My weekly searches and storming of sites of work yielded no results.  Goblins came, vegetables came, even "little people" came, but there was not one who could truly understand the whole meaning of the vacancy "A young company developing an innovative product in the field of Internet communications requires PHP programmers and Web designers."  Of the approximately 15 candidates reviewed, whom we had the honor of seeing in person at the interview only one (!) Knew what a startup is, the rest is not that the ‚Äústartup‚Äù they don‚Äôt read blogs in principle.  It was a shock to us.  When the vegetables ‚Äúanswered uh-uh ... we don't have free time‚Äù to the question ‚Äúwhat do you read on the Internet in your free time‚Äù, and to the question ‚ÄúAre you familiar with php-frameworks‚Äù answered ‚Äú0_o and what‚Äôs this?‚Äù ... here we just had no words to answer.  Yes, maybe we want a lot, maybe we are too demanding for people from sites where PHP Programmer, Web Developer and Web Designer are one and the same.  But the tree-stick!  you build your career!  read the internet!  Of course, the vegetables were frightened and left in a hurry when we said that ‚Äúour budget is limited, but we can share with you all the experiences you never dreamed of!  these are technologies, and experience in teamwork, and experience (in my opinion the most valuable) of a start-up development ... ‚Äùusually here the vegetable was already sitting with glass eyes, did not move and did not react to external stimuli. <br><br>  In principle, I understand them, I was there - to sit in a large office where you are fed, they insure you, they pay you "well" - that is of course good.  But at the same time you sit, like you are fine, you feel good, but the question is spinning in your head: ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù.  They take 8 hours of my life per day for themselves.  Their insurance considers only insurance claims that occurred to you at work (!) Or on the way to / from work.  They don't let you grow as you want, as your industry wants - ‚ÄúI want to study C # to improve my skills‚Äù - this was a bad goal in my perfomance dialog, of course, why should you grow if you need to come to work and turn this cog  They pay you a "good" RFP - yes, 1.5-2k (for Kiev) is good, but for what?  You will not build a normal life with such money without limiting yourself. <br><br>  Perhaps we are too biased towards this whole thing.  Everyone has their own priorities, their own interests, their own life.  And this is normal, there are not many enterprising people, but we are in vests!
