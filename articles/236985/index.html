      This book, which appears in the fourth edition and has already become a classic textbook on programming, describes in detail the internal structure and functioning of the Microsoft .NET Framework version 4.5 common language performing environment (CLR).  Written by recognized programming expert Jeffrey Richter, who has been a consultant to the Microsoft .NET Framework development team for many years, the book will teach you how to create truly reliable applications of any kind, including using Microsoft Silverlight, ASP.NET, Windows Presentation Foundation, and more. .d  The fourth edition is fully updated in accordance with the specification of the .NET Framework 4.5, as well as the environment of Visual Studio 2012 and C # 5.0 <br><br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549600433/978549600433_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549600433/978549600433_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br><h4>  Programming for Microsoft Windows 8. 6th ed. </h4><br>  Posted by: C. Petzold <br><br>  The sixth edition of this legendary book had to wait almost 15 years!  In his new work, Charles Petzold, a well-known author and one of the pioneers of Windows programming, talks about developing applications for the Windows Store using C # and XAML in the Windows Runtime environment.  The first part of the book "Basics" is devoted to techniques that are especially important for most ordinary programmers: the assembly of ready-made controls in the application and their association with code and data.  This fully explains the entire program code and markup generated by Visual Studio for different project templates.  The second part of the book ‚ÄúSpecial features‚Äù describes low-level and non-standard tasks - touch input, raster graphics, advanced text formatting, printing, work with orientation sensors and GPS.  The book is addressed to developers confidently fluent in C # who want to learn the API for developing applications for Windows 8. <br><br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549600863/978549600863_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549600863/978549600863_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br><h4>  C # programming language.  Classic Computers Science.  4th ed. </h4><br>  Authors: A. Hejlsberg, M. Torgersen, S. Wiltamut, P. Gold <br><br>  This is the fourth edition of the main C # language book written by programming legend Anders Hejlsberg, C # architect, Delphi, and Turbo Pascal, along with other experts who were part of the Microsoft C # design team.  The publication is the most complete description of the language and the most authoritative source of information on this topic, built in the format of a collection of specifications, including a description of the syntax, related materials and examples, as well as code samples.  This book is a kind of ‚Äúbible‚Äù of the developer, which can easily replace both MSDN and other books on C #.  The fourth edition contains a description of the new features of C # 4.0, including dynamic binding, named and optional parameters, as well as covariant and contravariant generic types.  The purpose of these innovations is to enhance the ability of C # to interact with non-.NET objects.  A distinctive feature of the new edition is that each chapter of the book contains extensive comments written by famous programming gurus, such as John Skit, Joseph Albahari, Bill Wagner, Christian Nagel, Eric Lippert, and others. <br><br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978545900283/978545900283_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978545900283/978545900283_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br><h4>  Applications for Windows 8 on C # and XAML </h4><br>  Posted by: J. Lickness <br><br>  This first practical guide to creating applications for Windows 8 covers the entire life cycle: from developing a project template to publishing to the Windows Store.  The author of the book, Jeremy Lickness, a leading specialist at Microsoft, will help you use your developer skills in working with new Visual Studio 2012 tools to create useful and innovative applications.  The book covers both business applications and user applications.  With the help of well-developed downloadable code samples and demonstration projects, the author shows how to make the most of new platform functions, including embedding in social networks, search, extensions, contracts and mosaic placement. <br><br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549600349/978549600349_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549600349/978549600349_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br><h4>  We study C #.  3rd ed. </h4><br>  Authors: E. Stillman, J. Green <br><br>  Unlike most books on programming, built on the basis of a boring statement of specifications and examples, with this book the reader will be able to immediately start writing their own code in the C # programming language from the very beginning.  You will master a minimal set of tools, and then take part in fun and interesting software projects: from developing a card game to creating a serious business application.  The second edition of the book includes the latest versions of C # 5.0, Visual Studio 2012 and the .NET 4.5 Framework, and will be interesting to anyone learning the C # programming language.  The peculiarity of this publication is a unique way of presenting the material, highlighting the ‚ÄúHead First‚Äù series of O'Reilly publishing house among a number of boring books on programming. <br><br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549600327/978549600327_X.pdf">Table of contents</a> <br>  <a href="http://storage.piter.com/upload/contents/978549600327/978549600327_p.pdf">Excerpt</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.piter.com/collection/yazyk-programmirovaniya-ss-s">Link</a> to the catalog of books </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236985/</a></p>
