      Today it is very fashionable to use the services of tutors who are native speakers.  But the meaning of this training is only if the teacher is well acquainted with the specifics of the test.  The best option is an experienced GRE tutor from Russia.  You need a person who himself has already passed the exam and trained other students. <br><br>  <b>Features teacher selection</b> <br><br>  If your task is <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/tests/sdacha-testa-gre-general/">to pass the general GRE test</a> , it will be more appropriate to find several teachers.  One of them will help improve the level of knowledge in mathematics, the other - will tighten you on the verbal part of the exam. <br><br>  Before enrolling in a course, be sure to pass a trial lesson.  Thus, you can understand whether it is convenient for you to communicate with a new teacher.  Mutual understanding plays an important role. <br><br>  Ask what materials the teacher uses, if he has his own teaching method.  A good teacher will always have suitable textbooks and an exemplary lesson plan.  It is worth paying attention to the fact that it is more expedient to use <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/ru/News_MBA/detail.php%3FID%3D1441119">American aids</a> when preparing for the exam. <br><br>  A good tutor in learning necessarily uses the latest technological advances: computer, Internet, e-books, etc.  It is advisable to audio recording of all classes.  At home, the student listens to them again and asks questions in the next lesson.  It is highly desirable that most of the classes be conducted in electronic form. <br><br>  Thus, a good GRE tutor should not only have a good knowledge of the theoretical basis, but also offer good modern teaching methods.  When choosing a teacher can be guided by the advice of experienced friends. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/909/0cf/9c4/9090cf9c49504cf4935d517dbaad7679.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Criteria for choosing a good teacher</b> <br><br>  Private lessons with a qualified teacher are an important advantage in preparing for the GRE exam.  But, in order not to regret the wasted time and money, the choice of a teacher must be approached very responsibly.  Here it is important to choose the right teacher for yourself, who can really give all the necessary knowledge.  Experts identify several criteria that a good tutor must meet. <br><br><ul><li>  Education and experience </li></ul><br>  When choosing a teacher to prepare for GRE, preference should be given to experienced and qualified candidates with pedagogical education.  It is desirable that the experience of the tutor was at least 5 years.  In addition, the teacher must be fluent in English, as one of the main tasks of the student will be the improvement of language skills. <br><br><ul><li>  Place of work </li></ul><br>  Choosing a teacher, you must be interested in his place of work.  The best option would be candidates working in universities and educational centers.  As a rule, the staff of such institutions are highly qualified and have extensive experience in the teaching field.  Thanks to this, they can competently build a preparation strategy and explain the material in an accessible manner. <br><br><ul><li>  GRE Experience </li></ul><br>  The best confirmation of the teacher‚Äôs abilities and professionalism is the GRE certificate with results exceeding the average score.  It is very important that the teacher be aware of not only the theoretical, but also the practical side of the test.  Having the experience of passing the exam, the GRE tutor will be able to share various secrets, advise or suggest something. <br><br><ul><li>  Personal qualities </li></ul><br>  Although this parameter is not directly related to preparation, it plays an important role.  A good teacher should have to himself and be pleasant to communicate.  For learning to be effective, good interaction and understanding are necessary between the teacher and the student.  The personal qualities of the tutor can be assessed before starting training by visiting a trial lesson. <br><br><ul><li>  Reviews </li></ul><br>  In the modern world, reputation is very important in any field of activity.  And tutoring was no exception.  If the teacher has a lot of negative feedback from former students, it is better to find another candidate.  Now there are many experienced teachers with an excellent reputation, so you should not risk in vain. <br><br>  A good GRE tutor will be the basis for successful preparation.  And if there is a desire and opportunity to use the services of a professional in the person of a qualified teacher to achieve the goal, it must be used. <br><br>  <i>We are completing a series of publications about the GRE test.</i>  <i>Our next articles will be devoted to master programs in various countries, features and all stages of admission to the program, as well as scholarships.</i>  <i>Stay tuned for new articles.</i> <br><br>  The author of the article is Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365023/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365023/</a></p>
