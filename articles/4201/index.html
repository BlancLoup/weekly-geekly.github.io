  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Banners increase the effectiveness of search advertising</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is no secret that almost every company uses several information channels for advertising campaigns: radio, television, newspapers, magazines, the Internet.  Therefore, it is not surprising if the same user receives several advertisements from the same company, but from different sources.  For example, in the afternoon, he saw a banner on the Internet, and in the evening, returning home, he came under a TV commercial.  Therefore, advertising specialists emphasize that each advertiser should take into account the effect of the mutual influence of information channels on each other when measuring the effect of their advertising campaigns.  There is a synergistic effect.  Information channels, if used together, increase the strength of each other's influence.  Until now, there were very few scientific studies that really could confirm this phenomenon. <br><br>  Atlas Institute conducted a <a href="http://atlassolutions.com/pdf/CombinedImpact_DMI.pdf">special study</a> (PDF file) to test this hypothesis.  During April 2006, the effectiveness of eleven major advertising campaigns was analyzed, where search and banner advertising were used simultaneously.  A total of 10.8 million banner-shows were analyzed and the behavior of 1.8 million users while viewing text advertising on search sites.  At the same time, the history of each user‚Äôs surfing was analyzed and it was taken into account whether he had previously seen the graphic banner of the company that now shows him text ads. <br><br>  It turned out that a synergistic effect between information channels really exists.  Users who have previously seen the company's graphic banner are 22% more likely to click on text advertising for this company.  This group includes 44% of all users who clicked on text ads.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
      On average, the CTR of search advertising is 3.3 times higher than the banner one, and the CTR of search advertising after displaying a banner gives the CTR four times higher than a simple banner display. <br><br>  A level of 22% is an average value.  During the experiment, the maximum CTR increase was registered at the level of 65%, and the minimum was generally negative.  The synergistic effect depends on various factors, the main of which is the number of users who managed to demonstrate both types of advertising.  The stronger the audience overlaps, the more powerful the synergistic effect. <br><br>  Experiments have shown that the highest CTR on search advertising is shown by those users who have previously been shown at least three banners by this advertiser.  Further increasing the frequency of impressions does not have a significant impact on the CTR and may even be harmful.  More than three banners to one person is not recommended. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4201/</a></p>
