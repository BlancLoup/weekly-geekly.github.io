We did not set ourselves the goal of inventing a new metal constructor, but only added the necessary.  The principal difference from conventional designers is as follows: <br><ul><li>  Strong metal.  Parts are made 0.75mm thick, 0.8mm, 1.0mm. </li><li>  Hard profile.  Beams of a P-shaped profile. </li><li>  Convenient to collect.

In my opinion it is: <br><br><ul><li>  investment in personnel </li><li>  increasing interest in IT (programming) </li><li>  attracting students to specific areas that Yandex and ABBYY have - machine learning, pattern recognition system. </li></ul><br>  In a recent <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/milliardery/255627-idi-na-mir-s-otkrytym-zabralom-intervyu-s-sergeem-galitskim-i-arkadiem-volozhem">article on Forbes</a> , Arkady Volozh (General Director of Yandex), noted separately the direction of machine learning: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Hidden text</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  Machine learning on big data is a new big technology.  All the great new technologies are penetrating everywhere.  When steam mechanics appeared 200 years ago, it was a fusion of a locomotive with everything: means of transport appeared, new textile machines, mechanization began everywhere, and it was a revolution.  The same with electronics, the same with the Internet: communications have appeared in our life, they are everywhere. <br><br>  Now on every street there are dozens of video cameras, we carry it in our pockets with a dozen sensors, we constantly request something on the Internet, etc. - all this is a bunch of signals.  When the plane flies, he has everything in the sensors, the car goes, it is all in electronics, everything is penetrated by the sensors.  They all collect huge amounts of data.  With them you can do some kind of math, some kind of "intelligence."  And this ‚Äúintelligence‚Äù everywhere optimizes something by 5‚Äì10%.  This is essentially the next industrial revolution.  Anyone who is able to collect and process this data, combine it with machine learning, will get obvious advantages.  In this sense, we have a good school in the country.  And if we teach this several thousand people, this is a big industry for the world. </blockquote></div></div><br>  Robotics - includes machine learning.  Pattern recognition (from ABBYY) is also actively used and developed in robotics, from the simplest (line follower) to face recognition. <br><br>  I am glad that companies such as Yandex and ABBYY have paid attention to robotics, educational robotics.  In my opinion, the integration of robotics in school classes will contribute to the <b>natural</b> formation of interest in IT disciplines, in technical creativity and ultimately in students' knowledge. <br><br>  By the way, there is still an extension to the direction of robotics!  <a href="http://www.aycamp.ru/registration/">Apply now</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228071/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228071/</a></p>
