According to the department, the valley should become a full-fledged innovation center and still compete with US Silicon Valley.  After all <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_(%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580)">, the Skolkovo</a> Innovation Center, on which high hopes were pinned on this plan, is not yet coping with the task. <br><br>  Work on the concept of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0_%25D0%259C%25D0%2593%25D0%25A3">Technological Valley of Moscow State University</a> has been underway since 2013.  Geographically, the valley is located in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Universitet metro station between Vernadsky Avenue and Michurinsky Avenue.  So far, ‚Äúfor complete happiness,‚Äù she lacks laboratories, industrial and residential complexes, as well as educational buildings and other important infrastructure facilities. <br><br>  According to the draft law, the valley is created "in order to develop research, development and commercialization of their results, including production." <a name="habracut"></a>

      The project will be implemented by a management company, 100% of whose shares will be owned by the state, Vedomosti <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/newspaper/articles/2016/03/09/632778-mgu-skolkovo">writes</a> .  In its property, the state (as a statutory contribution) will transfer land plots on Lomonosovsky Avenue in Moscow, the government should determine their borders. <br><br>  The management company will receive the right to independently manage the acquired land, build it up or transfer it to other persons for construction for the purposes of the project, give names to the streets, and so on.  In addition, she will be able to hire foreign specialists without regard to the quotas established by the government.  Project participants will be able to rely on tax and customs benefits, as well as receive guarantees against adverse changes in tax laws. <br><br>  At the beginning of 2014, the creation of the MSU valley was estimated at approximately 110 billion rubles.  In October of the same year, the rector of Moscow State University, Viktor Sadovnichy, said that construction would be completed by 2020. <br><br>  In December 2015, the Rusbase edition <a href="http://rusbase.com/news/skoltech-msu/">reported</a> that the Skolkovo Institute would cede part of research projects and associated state funding to the Valley of Moscow State University. <br><br>  Political analyst Ekaterina Shulman notes that the poor results of Skolkovo are not a special case, the problem is systemic: <br><blockquote>  Traditionally, regimes with low quality of state administration are trying to create so-called ‚Äúpockets of efficiency,‚Äù that is, territories where there are special ‚Äî meaning more suitable for economic or intellectual life ‚Äî rules.  There are already a huge number of such ‚Äúpockets‚Äù in Russia - here there are Skolkovo, special economic zones, territories of priority development, and the Far East. <br><br>  [But] the existence of such special zones does not insure against arbitrariness, and this is precisely what investors and scientists and innovators fear most. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299170/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299170/</a></p>
