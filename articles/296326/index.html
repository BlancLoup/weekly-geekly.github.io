Today (and always) we are going to talk about announcements, social networks, our observations, statistics, promotion methods and everything that surrounds any project at the beginning of its path. <br>  But first, some lyrics and background.  So, let's begin. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"

      <br>
      When a person realizes that his closest circle of friends ‚Äî people who can call or write personally ‚Äî cannot satisfy his need (buy his apartment, car, or shelter a homeless kitten found on the street), we switch to outsiders.  How?  We announce our initiative to sell, give away or exchange.  And it is in our interest that the ad sees as large an audience as possible.  To do this, only one thing - to attract attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/20f/20e/ba0/20f20eba0c85472bb9ac1b31ca2b1ccb.jpg"><br><br>  Each of us had to give ads.  At least once in a lifetime, but we all did it, right?  When my beloved cat disappeared from our apartment, my parents were saddled with the eyes of my tantrums.  Later, I myself concluded that the incessant tears of children are worse than a cat that regularly pees you in shoes. <br><br>  And my parents posted ads all over the area.  A senior pupil, whose name I did not remember, found our cat in a neighboring yard, brought it to our house and handed it to me, swollen with tears.  As she explained to my mom, an ad caught her attention.  Do you know why? <br><br>  Previously, there were few options for ads, or rather, two: either an A4 white sheet with printed text and a picture, or the same white sheet, only A5 with a fringe cut out for tearing off.  This is true for those who sell "in bulk" - potato buckets, for example.  Such ad attracted attention due to its location - at bus stops or at the entrance, where the eyes fell on them. <br><br>  There were also ‚Äúcreative‚Äù options - in fact, the same ones, but at the same time the paper was acid-pink or green, with the aim of striking every passer-by.  This sin, and still sin those who rent apartments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/448/a6d/e21/448a6de216514d7395ba1464543e9447.jpg"><br><br>  But there was a third type of ad, truly unique, which with the advent of technology has sunk into oblivion.  These are handwritten ads.  Cool stuff, real hand made!  Sometimes you could see a truly calligraphic handwriting inviting you to buy valuable books or porcelain figurines.  And the sheets?  Striped, striped ... How interesting it was to read them!  After all, a man tried, wrote out every letter! <br><br>  But the coolest ads, in my opinion, are ads written by children.  With colored pencils or felt-tip pens, illegible, but so sincere that a tear comes to light when you read.  ‚ÄúThe red kitty, whose name is Musya, who has found the reward, is lost, let us pet!‚Äù The children are the coolest creatives, they are absolutely not interested in gain, they don‚Äôt need to sell, rent or sell to you.  They only want to find her mother Musa. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be9/040/359/be90403599c84a718e9ad250defcf0c4.jpg"><br><br>  If you thought that I spent all day looking through the bulletin boards or walking around the city, looking at rectangles or squares of paper with phone numbers, then you are wrong!  I have been doing this instinctively for many years now, because it‚Äôs impossible not to notice ads on poles, fences, in the subway, on shuttles, at the entrance or in the elevator - they are everywhere.  Well, after WEB 2.0.  You can‚Äôt hide from ads either at home, at the computer - the omnipresent banners blink from each site. <br><br>  So the thought came to me: ‚ÄúWhy can't it be done beautifully, originally, brightly and even touchingly, like those kids who are looking for Muska?‚Äù The answer came quickly - why not, because you can!  And we sat down to think.  So our <a href="http://krob.me/">project</a> was born. <br>  To be honest, the service is only a couple of weeks, and we understand that it is not perfect.  But feedback from users gives us to understand that we are on the right track. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec4/bab/d65/ec4babd659b54a039ae22a5b9c4916e5.jpg"><br><br>  Now there is an active process of working on the project, and therefore we are here on the Megamind.  Criticism or encouragement from you, dear readers, is the best that we can give ourselves at this stage.  Well, and also because we have set our sights on the creation of such a thing as a new social (ob) phenomenon.  See how we can do it - we will tell you honestly.  We will share the promotion methods that really helped us, lay out statistics, logs, screenshots, everything that Mega-community likes so much.  Our mobile app for Droid and Axis will be released very soon, we will also discuss these kids!  Share real experience. <br><br>  For those who scroll the text in the search for useful information.  Stop!  Here she is. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5FCF80">Useful number one</font> </h4><br>  When creating custom services, websites and similar pieces, do not forget about your audience and current trends.  Remember that a significant part of users (read - your audience) comes into the network using mobile devices! <br><br>  If you didn‚Äôt think about adaptive, mobile version, you lose, a huge amount of traffic and feedback can be extremely negative, because users simply can‚Äôt see your offer and will never return to you again!  We, by the way, did not think!  Therefore, we are only with a PC. <br><br><h4>  <font color="#5FCF80">Useful number two</font> </h4><br>  Make a workable product, try to wrap it beautifully and show the target audience.  The first users themselves will say what they like and what does not.  And then comes the time for improvements - constantly, constantly improve.  Weekly iterations are best suited!  Paul Graham was talking about these things! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296326/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296326/</a></p>
