As a result, the correspondence turned out to be an interesting overview of the advantages and disadvantages of the PSP, not only through the eyes of the owners of the smartZone.ru site, but also by an outsider. <br><br>  below is the correspondence: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>gadzilla69:</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  <strong>I will now express my personal opinion, simply, on the future.</strong>  <strong>I listened to your post about comparing PSP FAT, and PSP Slim.</strong>  <strong>Comrade</strong>  <strong>With all due respect to your artistry ... I would advise you to look at least a configuration of consoles.</strong>  <strong>What is 6 MB of RAM on FAT?</strong>  <strong>There are 32 mb.</strong>  <strong>On slim 64. In general, it was very unpleasant to me to listen to lies and nonsense, especially since you did not cover the main topic.</strong>  <strong>The main advantages of consoles, I have not heard.</strong>

      <em>Talik:</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Dear, you are wrong - for everyone at least there is one opinion about the old and new psp plugs</em> <em><br></em>  <em>The advantages that We found for ourselves - we indicated in the podcast.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Probably for you these are completely different features - so to speak, pleasing to the depths of the soul.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>If you have a reasoned opinion about YOUR PLUSES and MINUSES on psp and psp slim - ready to publish them on <a href="http://www.smartzone.ru/">www.smartzone.ru</a> as a separate material.</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>With regards to RAM - the console is not a computer - the real amount of RAM absolutely does not matter.</em>  <em>I think you know perfectly well that only in the world of computers games are written, and they do already iron, in the world of consoles everything is the other way around for specific hardware games and the user doesn‚Äôt bother about how much my psp really has brains but does the game start and so on ...</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>And where lies and nonsense ??</em> <br><br>  <strong>gadzilla69:</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  <strong>RAM is still an important point, it is still worth thinking about what it is used for.</strong>  <strong>Data from a UMD disk, or from FLASH-memory (practically no difference) is copied into that very operative memory, and then from it comes roughly the ‚Äúpicture‚Äù.</strong>  <strong>How many models, textures, sounds fit in your rough 6 mb?</strong>  <strong>It's not even about them.</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  <strong>For the test, take the PSP with ‚Äúcustom‚Äù firmware, turn on the game from the memory card, for example, GTA: Vice city stories, and then pull out the memory card.</strong>  <strong>What will you see?</strong>  <strong>The game continues to work as it did, and the information remains in the RAM, the game only ‚Äúloads‚Äù the model imperceptibly for the player, and again uses its own RAM volume.</strong>  <strong>By the way, yes, if in the same VCS "drive on the car" further down the road, soon the road will become transparent - because there is no place to upload files, the memory card is not inserted.</strong>  <strong>Well, this is so, for example, so that you can understand the essence of RAM in the console, that this is really an important thing.</strong>  <strong>Tried to run GTA on FAT, and next to Slim?</strong>  <strong>Accelerate by car, and feel the difference.</strong>  <strong>First of all, on Slim the movement of the car will be "thicker", and the models will be loaded much faster.</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  <strong>This is all said for an example, but it all works in absolutely any game.</strong>  <strong>And this is an indisputable plus.</strong>  <strong>Regarding the release on TV - you, as far as I remember, said that this is basically an unnecessary thing.</strong>  <strong>And you did not try to connect the PSP to a 40 inch LCD TV, and enjoy the picture?</strong>  <strong>Moreover, it is possible to watch movies in such a way that I think is more than convenient - you can carry a portable multimedia center with you, while watching the same movies anywhere, playing games, and so on.</strong> <strong><br><br></strong>  <strong>Regarding the weight of the consoles - my friend FAT, honestly, I played for half an hour, begins to "break" in the hands.</strong>  <strong>Unpleasant, for heavy console.</strong>  <strong>With Slim, the blessing has been going on for how much, and his subtlety is almost annoying.</strong>  <strong>But let's really look at things - PSP Slim, this is the same development, only improved, completed, completed.</strong>  <strong>Added what you need, removed what we do not need.</strong>  <strong>and what you read on the forums, about how convincingly people said that FAT is better, should not be taken seriously.</strong>  <strong>This works according to the principle ‚ÄúMy sandbox is better‚Äù, because you need to find an excuse why you will not change your prefix to the new version.</strong> <br><br>  <em>Talik:</em> <em><br><br></em>  <em>Those who listened to the podcast carefully - confirm - the final conclusion of my opponent is the same as mine.</em> <br><br>  Here is such a dialogue :) <br><br>  As mentioned in the podcast for us, the strengths of the old psp are: support for the kernel from 1.5 and, as a result, the launch of old console emulators such as NES, Sega, SNES <br>  launch homebrew to watch .AVI video without converting to mp4 <br><br>  for the rest, psp slim is more pleasant in terms of operating time, performance and weight. <br><br>  <strong>About the podcast itself:</strong> <br>  Fifth edition of the Smart Electronics Territory podcast - smartZone.ru <br><br>  Having both versions of the Sony PSP on hand, we argue what exactly became better in the new version of the console, and what fans of the portable console lost from the appearance of the PSP Slim <br>  The difference in trim levels <br>  Progs and emulators <br>  Who and what in the end like? <br>  Podcast lead <a href="http://vitaly.chuyakov.ru/">talik</a> and <a href="http://ana-sm.ru/">ana</a> <br><br>  This podcast is another test of the new podcast recording equipment.  Unlike previous recording options, when we used Audacity today we used Skype and MX Skype Recorder as recording stations for dialogue. <br>  Recorded on <a href="http://vitaly.chuyakov.ru/main/blog/poleznoe/asus-eee-pc/">Asus EeePC</a> <br>  But the mixing of the voice track and the musical backing still took place in Audacity. <br>  As a lining an excerpt from the mix dj_iridium _-_ open_air_sunrise <br><br>  <strong>You can download the podcast by direct link.</strong> <br>  <a href="">smartzone podcast # 5</a> <br>  size: 14 megabytes <br>  Duration: 30 minutes 32 seconds <br>  Bit rate: 64kb / s <br><br>  ( <a href="http://smartzone.ru/node/261">C</a> ) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/26956/">https://habr.com/ru/post/26956/</a></p>
