Those who are in the coding vryatle long <br>  will find in the article something new for themselves, and some things <br>  may not even seem worthy of attention.  However worth <br>  remember that the obvious things for one are unknown <br>  the world for another, and your experience of good practice can be <br>  way out of a difficult situation for someone. <br>  <i>Management</i> - find out what events are worth holding <br>  in the company to improve workflow, enhance <br>  employee experience, cost reduction (by reducing <br>  time overruns and accounting not calculated <br>  earlier activities) and quality improvement. <br>  <i>Project managers</i> will help <br>  consider some of the project‚Äôs specific risks: learn about <br>  previously unknown absorbers of project time and not <br>  planned activities;  learn about real work <br>  for some activities;  evaluate and improve the current level <br>  project management. <br>  <i>Other participants of web development</i> will help more <br>  learn about the working life of their colleagues. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Initially, the article was in tabular form, which corresponded to <br>  semantics of the material.  However, having published an article in LJ and <br>  having received a number of not only priceless comments (ala "non-violent", "many <br>  bukaff "), but also practical advice to redo the material <br>  Without tables I decided to follow him.  Bug work <br>  done - the article is given in blog-like (what words <br>  generates our time) view and exposed to the habrasoobschestvu. <br>  Grouped factors <br> <a href=""><img src="http://www.amazedev.com/files/html_d.gif"></a> <br><h2>  HTML coder operation </h2><br><h3>  1. Source data and material for layout. </h3><br><h3>  1.1 Design Layout </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  The client sends substandard material for layout. <br>  Material in pdf, ppt, jpg or psd with glued <br>  layers, rasterized fonts, fonts with anti-aliasing; <br>  fonts that are not included in the delivery of Windows.  Requirements <br>  described verbally (‚Äúmake it red‚Äù, ‚Äúmake it like this‚Äù). <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  Layout material should be in PSD format (not excluded <br>  another popular format that supports layers).  In psd <br>  used layers are named according to their content. <br>  Fonts that are not included in the standard Windows distribution are used. <br>  only for pictures. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  Glued layers, rasterized text and other unmet requirements for the source material lead to an increase in layout time. <br><br>  <i>Example:</i> the design uses a button in the form of a picture.  It is necessary to make similar by analogy.  When designing what it should be, it will take about 10 minutes.  With poor quality it may take 2 hours. <br><br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. PM:</i> At the stage of clarifying the requirements to give the client <br>  read the graphic requirements document <br>  material.  (Containing examples of requirements. Desirable <br>  with screenshots and explanations for each item). <br>  <i>2. PM:</i> Involve the customer in the compliance monitoring process <br>  requirements for acceptance by third-party designers.  Explain <br>  that the quality of graphic material primarily affects <br>  on the feeling of trust and the attitude of his future clients (users) <br>  site, as well as the quality of the html coder.  (Important <br>  distinguish quality design and beautiful design: it is not <br>  identical things). <br><h3>  1.2 Redesign </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  The client sends or reports links (which is even worse) to <br>  pages with a curtailed design of poor quality (without <br>  typical elements containing cross-browser problems, <br>  invalid code). <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  The client sends a coded code.  HTML coder, PM and others <br>  participants check its quality and availability <br>  items. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  If the fact of poor quality pages is not voiced to the client <br>  or PM, then for all the resulting bugs responsibility is shifted <br>  on HTML coder.  This increases the unplanned time. <br>  fixing bugs. <br>  In the case of pages located on the Internet, before <br>  than to proceed with the layout, the coder needs a retraining stage <br>  to create a site locally.  This time should be considered. <br>  in assessing. <br>  <i>Example:</i> To recreate a site locally where everything is <br>  The pictures are written in CSS, the layout designer should be tracked. <br>  the path of each, register it in the address bar to copy <br>  every picture to local disk.  Number of registered <br>  in CSS images is not limited. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. PM:</i> At the stage of clarifying the requirement to emphasize <br>  the importance of the quality of the input material and the consequences of bad: <br>  technical (bugs, time overrun, bad <br>  extensibility) and a negative impact on a sense of trust <br>  and the attitude of future customers (users). <br>  <i>2. PM:</i> Ask the customer to send the code <br>  instead of posting on the site (if there is no FTP access).  it <br>  allows the HTML encoder to immediately work with the code "as is" <br>  without retraining.  It is important to note that this <br>  also prevents the client from silently adding <br>  New items under the guise of the same work plan. <br>  <i>3. HTML Encoder:</i> Notify PM of possible problems. <br>  errors and quality of the material.  Write which items <br>  not missing in the new design.  Ask for a comparative <br>  analysis of new and old design (find out what is changing, <br>  what is added, what is removed, etc.). <br><h3>  2. Layout requirements (DIV, table, mixed). </h3><br><h3>  2.1 Layout on divas </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  Projects with block layout requirement (semantic layout <br>  using DIV) are performed by encoders that do not have <br>  necessary experience, or block layout is used there, <br>  where it is not justified. <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  Block layout should be applied in places where it is <br>  application is justified (subjective opinion) if: <br>  - compliance with standards is required; <br>  - This is the only possible way to implement; <br>  - these are customer or platform requirements; <br>  - this is a way to reduce the number of bugs for web-developers. <br>  when working with HTML code; <br>  - it is necessary to simplify the points of contact of the client with <br>  by code <br>  The ability to "impose divas" (and edit a sufficient number <br>  non-trivial bugs) requires a similar experience <br>  HTML coder. <br>  A less elegant but stable tabular layout covers <br>  basic requests for layout in 80% of typical tasks. <br>  Mixed layout - a compromise and a way to absorb the best <br>  of two options. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  Block layout introduces the probability of non-existent <br>  tabular layout of bugs, such as: <br>  - incorrect render by browser; <br>  - incorrect or unpredictable typesetting behavior when <br>  changing the window size, font, text size, etc .; <br>  - complex cross-browser bugs. <br>  Such bugs are fixed quite difficult, often using <br>  hacks and undocumented features.  No solutions <br>  always cross-browser, extensible and reliable. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. PM and HTML coder:</i> At the beginning of the project to discuss issues <br>  concerning typesetting. <br>  <i>2 PM and HTML coder:</i> Take advantage of a consultant <br>  ask for advice from colleagues. <br><h3>  2.2 Requires tabular layout, and the source material on <br>  block </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  For redesign of projects that were on the table layout <br>  client provided version fully implemented in DIV <br>  make-up <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  If the material provided by the customer is made on DIVs, <br>  and the existing implementation is on the tables, it is necessary <br>  use a mixed layout, and also consider possible <br>  Adaptation problems in temporal assessment. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  If the type of the layout does not match then you need to understand that reworking <br>  a new type is no longer a redesign, but actually a creation <br>  the entire design from scratch, which in reality will lead to a huge <br>  the number of bugs, inconsistencies and unforeseen situations.

      The same result (creation almost from scratch, and not rework), <br>  if the customer sent the layout is not suitable for use <br>  platforms. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. HTML Encoder:</i> Use Mixed Layout (Process <br>  adaptations and bugs at the two types of joints cannot be avoided, however <br>  this minimizes the time spent compared to creating <br>  from scratch). <br>  <i>2. PM:</i> Understand and take into account when assessing that in such <br>  situation design is not taken as it is.  Final result <br>  is a symbiosis of past decision and client <br>  option.  Any innovation is fraught with bugs, multiplying <br>  exponentially. <br><h3>  3. Knowledge of the project (folder structures, elements generating <br>  design). </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  HTML coder does not know the project. <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  HTML coder knows the project. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  Ignorance of the project leads to the fact that <br>  with the features of the implementation of the system, time is spent allocated <br>  to perform the task itself.  The next article is significant <br>  time wasting - bugs and shortcomings that occurred because of ignorance <br>  systems (unaccounted pages, different display at different <br>  conditions, etc.). <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. Workflow:</i> Learning Platforms Used <br>  in free time from projects.  Task for familiarization with <br>  system before the start of the project.  Conduct mandatory <br>  certification system knowledge. <br>  <i>2. Workflow:</i> Use consultant in project <br>  with the consultancy task (except for this task it is in the project <br>  may not participate). <br>  <i>3. PM and HTML coder:</i> Take advantage of a consultant <br>  ask for advice from colleagues. <br><h3>  4. The degree of dependence on the software and hardware. </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  High dependence on software and hardware. <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  Autonomous, parallel work. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  Examples of dependencies that are reflected in time: <br>  - Dependence on PC hardware (Photoshop (several <br>  simultaneously open PSD), Dreamweaver (2-3 windows), TopStyle <br>  (2-3 open files), explorer (or commander), 2-3 open <br>  browser (FireFox, IE, Opera) and sometimes the program to work <br>  c PHP is a very typical example work area). <br>  - Dependence on hardware and Internet HTML encoder <br>  in work it is required to see the instant result of their <br>  action, because  sometimes layout is built on the assumption <br>  and the results of how the design behaves in certain <br>  changing conditions.  The waiting time is sometimes <br>  exceeds the time to create it.  When, even to see <br>  the result of the smallest changes you need to wait <br>  long reloading of the entire page (and reloads the page <br>  coder for the project quite a few times). <br>  - dependence on programmer actions and related programs <br>  with a workflow.  Although SVN (and others <br>  version control system) is designed not only to keep <br>  the code, but also the development of parallelization, sometimes it is necessary <br>  instead of developing messing with upgrading svn and restoring <br>  health of your host after the upgrade.  It's related <br>  with the fact that a parallel developer changes something radical, <br>  hides or adds some of the functionality affecting <br>  and to work HTML coder. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. Workflow (project team):</i> Discuss <br>  influence each other and on the basis of this suggest order <br>  Tasks <br>  <i>2. Workflow:</i> Acceptable PC power and speed <br>  the Internet. <br><h3>  5. Stage of entry into the project. </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  The coder enters the project when the key part is not yet ready. <br>  functionality or part that affects the visual display. <br>  Interventions or rework in already worked out are possible. <br>  pages.  Remained not clarified until the end of the site. <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  The project runs in such a way that the coder and the developer work <br>  either in parallel or coder after the developer. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  Regressions unreasonably take time that cannot <br>  be calculated at the beginning. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. Workflow (project team):</i> Discuss <br>  influence each other and on the basis of this suggest order <br>  Tasks <br>  <i>2. Workflow:</i> Effective communication over <br>  During the course of the project, you can avoid regressions or reduce <br>  their number, avoid bugs. <br>  <i>3. PM:</i> Controls the project at intermediate stages. <br>  The lack of control by the PM during the project will pour out <br>  in regression, remake and abruptly at the end.  If at the beginning <br>  there is a development, then coding and stretching, then before stretching <br>  the development results should be checked for compliance <br>  to requirements of the specification and the representations.  As shown <br>  practice, the absence of this leads to the following situations: <br>  - time spent on development, and there is no possibility <br>  attract resources for refinement.  Have to distract employed <br>  on another project of people. <br>  - The normal HTML coding process is broken.  Due to flaws <br>  have to redo and finish pieces of the project, by <br>  which, it seemed, the work was completed. <br>  - emergency work, time overrun, bugs. <br><h3>  6. Communication and clarification of emerging issues along the way. <br>  project with project participants. </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  Communication is difficult (between client and PM or participants <br>  teams). <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  There are no problems with communications. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  Difficult discussion of operational issues leads to ambiguous <br>  understanding of requirements.  If you had a question that you <br>  decided on their own, and his decision did not coincide with the vision <br>  client, this will lead to alteration =&gt; loss of the project <br>  of time. <br>  Team communications also affect the process.  For example, <br>  using IM when discussing operational issues often <br>  slows down communication, because some things are hard enough <br>  and a long time to explain, and also have to do it right away <br>  with several people in several windows. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. Workflow:</i> One of the implicit improvements <br>  communications - a working slang dictionary in the wiki.  New employee <br>  can easily read and understand the words used <br>  from the lexicon of colleagues.  Project team members should <br>  be proactive in improving communications (use <br>  both logical tools and technical means). <br>  <i>2. Workflow:</i> Better for project team <br>  general chat, where all project participants will be informed <br>  project. <br><h3>  7. Conditions and limitations of the platform or project used. <br></h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  The project team does not know the requirements of the system or work <br>  components responsible for the design.  Have to redo <br>  under the newly recognized requirements. <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  Layout takes into account the requirements of the system during stretching. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  Emerging new requirements in the form of restrictions and conditions <br>  systems lead to alterations and adaptations that entail <br>  wasting unplanned time. <br>  <i>Example 1:</i> It is not always possible to download the current one. <br>  version of the client‚Äôs site, so to work locally <br>  pull out some parts and put them on locale.  More often <br>  you have to do first locally, then after checking <br>  do the same actions on the client.  Unplanned <br>  time is a repetition of the same actions on the client and time, <br>  spent on eliminating the difference (download / jump on / s <br>  customer). <br>  <i>Example 2:</i> Open Source Strongly Restricted <br>  and conditions.  So in the OsCommerce system the category content <br>  goods are generated hard in the code, which may entail <br>  not just HTML rework, but even PHP rework. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. Workflow (project team):</i> Discuss <br>  bottlenecks, examine the system before starting the project. <br>  <i>2. PM and HTML coder:</i> Take advantage of the consultant <br>  ask for advice from colleagues. <br>  <i>3. Workflow:</i> Outline Problem Solving <br>  or the problems themselves in the wiki, creating a knowledge base. <br><h3>  8. Qualifications and experience.  Ability to identify a problem <br>  solve and ‚Äúoutline‚Äù. </h3><br>  <b>Worst case:</b> <br>  HTML coder uses unstable solutions, not interested <br>  in improving the quality of work, indifferent to trends and <br>  technicians. <br>  <b>Good practice:</b> <br>  HTML coder improves technique, is interested in trends. <br>  He meets others' experience and creates his own work. <br>  <b>Impact:</b> <br>  An experienced specialist - the key to solving any problem. <br>  <b>Actions:</b> <br>  <i>1. Workflow:</i> Promote base benefits <br>  knowledge.  Cultivate and centralize material.  Light up <br>  and bring to attention, engage. <br>  <i>2. HTML coder:</i> Use read in practice <br>  not afraid to experiment, to observe the result.  Meet <br>  and explore related areas of knowledge, accumulate and synthesize <br>  knowledge.  Propose the introduction of run-in and considered options. <br>  <i>3. HTML coder:</i> 70% of problems you encounter <br>  In the process of work, someone has already decided.  Documented <br>  the decision will allow not only not to recall frantically how <br>  it was solved last time, but also to get rid of such thoughts <br>  colleagues. <br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ <br>  Source: <a href="http://www.amazedev.com/">Web Development Blog</a> <a href="http://www.amazedev.com/"><br></a>  <a href="http://www.amazedev.com/">and ways to improve it</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/15906/">https://habr.com/ru/post/15906/</a></p>
