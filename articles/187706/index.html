In this article, I will introduce you to the new operating system, review the main development tools and resources associated with it, and talk about ways to make a profit with Tizen. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <a href="https://www.tizen.org/ru/about">Tizen</a> is an open source operating system based on the Linux kernel.  It is designed for smartphones, tablets, PCs and other devices and works on processors with ARM and x86 architectures.  Tizen is supported by <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/">Linux Foudation</a> and a number of large companies that are members of the <a href="http://www.tizenassociation.org/">Tizen Association</a> consortium: this includes OEMs (such as Intel, Samsung, Panasonic, NEC, Huawei), and cellular operators (Orange, Vodafone, SK Telecom, Telefonica, NTT DoCoMo) .  The steering committee (Technical Steering Group) is formed by Intel and Samsung. <br><br><h4>  Tizen features and architecture </h4><br>  Initially, Tizen was conceived as an operating system, the development for which should have been entirely done using Web-based technologies.  This idea is not new and was used even in <a href="https://developer.palm.com/">webOS</a> , and then in <a href="http://www.chromium.org/chromium-os">Google Chrome OS</a> .  An example of this experience for mobile devices, you can watch, watching the development of <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/B2G">Firefox OS</a> .  This approach left a certain imprint on the current state of Tizen.  For example, the <a href="http://www.webkit.org/">WebKit2-</a> based browser Tizen has the highest level of support for HTML5 standards.  This can be seen using the site <a href="http://html5test.com/">http://html5test.com</a> (open, see how good your browser is).  In the test, Tizen scores 492 points out of 500 possible, while in second place is also the mobile browser used on <a href="http://global.blackberry.com/blackberry-10.html">BlackBerry 10</a> devices, with 485 points, and among PC applications, the first <a href="http://www.maxthon2.ru/mx4/">Maxthon 4.0</a> , which has only 476. Now the only compatibility problems with Tizen HTML5 is related to WebM, Drag and Drop and Pointer Lock for video and animation.

The fact is that Tizen not only offers Web components for building user interfaces and supports <a href="http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/">W3C / HTML5</a> standards, but also provides a Web API for managing applications (alarms and reminders, installed applications, data exchange), communication (Bluetooth, messaging, NFC etc., content, file system, organizer (bookmarks, calendar, call history, contacts), system functions (power, system information, system settings, time) and notifications. <br><br>  On the other hand, starting from version 2.0, Tizen has added native development tools using C ++ - Samsung's operating system has been used for the <a href="http://www.bada.com/">bada</a> operating system, so there is a high level of compatibility with the bada 2.0 API.  This makes it possible to natively develop productive applications using the OpenGL ES, OpenAL and OpenMP technologies and the Glibc, libstdc ++ and libxml2 libraries. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/652/4e2/33f/6524e233ff6ce6a753469bb08b70ffc3.png" alt="Tizen architecture"></div><br><br>  The current structure of the Tizen architecture can be seen in the figure above.  It is based on the Linux kernel and device drivers.  The main subsystem consists of open source libraries and a set of APIs for running the Web and native environments. <br><br><h4>  Versions and options of Tizen </h4><br>  Now you can most clearly see the development of Tizen for mobile devices.  This is exactly the version of the operating system that is used for the Tizen SDK emulator and on Samsung devices for developers.  In 2012, the <a href="https://wiki.tizen.org/wiki/Reference_Device-210">Samsung RD-210</a> device was distributed, based on the Galaxy S2 HD hardware platform.  Now the actual device is <a href="https://wiki.tizen.org/wiki/Reference_Device-PQ">Samsung RD-PQ</a> , based on the Galaxy S3.  It has a Super AMOLED screen with a capacitive sensor and a resolution of 720x1280, an Exynos Quad chipset, including a 1.4 GHz Cortex A9 quad-core processor, two cameras (8 MP main and 1.9 MP front), a set of sensors, Bluetooth, NFC and t dd <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4c5/838/f5d/4c5838f5d9fe419519f7eab0ff207ae1.jpg"><br><br>  Just recently, on July 22, a <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/ru/downloads/sdk/2.2-release-notes">new version 2.2 of the</a> operating system and development tools was released, which fixed bugs, added support for the ‚ÄúMenu‚Äù and ‚ÄúBack‚Äù hardware buttons, and made <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/documentation/ux-guide/whats-new">some changes to the interface</a> and API. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68b/7ed/27d/68b7ed27d5d48762410f38f03620af85.png" alt="Tizen 2.2 screenshots"><br><br>  At the end of May <a href="https://www.tizen.org/ru/events/tizen-developer-conference/2013">, a Tizen developer conference was held</a> , at which, among other things, the latest developments were presented.  At this conference, Tizen version 3.0 was announced, which is planned to be released in 2014.  This version is intended for PCs and laptops.  The work of the technical sample of this version of the operating system (Tizen PC) using the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/gnome-3/">GNOME 3 desktop was</a> demonstrated on Intel ultrabooks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a80/c38/7e2/a80c387e23217e9b5c744d1a061e7c1a.jpg"><br><br>  Another version of the Tizen that was presented at the conference is <a href="https://wiki.tizen.org/wiki/IVI">Tizen IVI (in-vehicle infortainment)</a> for car infotainment systems.  Compatible equipment was demonstrated on Land Rover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e2d/65b/5d1/e2d65b5d10d1c423e4a4b22bbaac496e.jpg"><br><br>  Tizen IVI was adopted as a standard by the GENVI alliance and was originally developed based on Tizen 2.0 for the x86 architecture (there is a <a href="http://maemo.su/wiki/Tizen/IVI/PC">way to install</a> this version on computers with Intel processors).  But a couple of weeks ago, a version was released based on the Tizen 3.0 code, which is planned to be used in further development.  It is curious that Tizen IVI was interested not only by such companies as Jaguar and Toyota, but <a href="http://vk.com/club1191183%3Fw%3Dwall-1191183_3742/all">also by domestic KAMAZ</a> . <br><br>  In addition, the possibility is being considered of using Tizen-based software for completely different types of devices in the future: televisions, digital signal receivers, multimedia systems, and even home appliances. <br><br><h4>  Tizen Development </h4><br>  The main Tizen development tool is the <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/ru/downloads/tizen-sdk">Tizen SDK</a> , which includes an Eclipse-based IDE, a set of tools ( <a href="https://01.org/web-simulator/online/">Web-simulator</a> , Emulator, Interface Designer, and others), a compiler, <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/ru/documentation">documentation,</a> and sample applications.  Tizen SDK builds are available for Ubuntu (x32 / x64), Windows XP and Windows 7 (x32 / x64), Apple Mac OS X 10.7 Lion and 10.8 Mountain Lion (x64).  Also in the SDK, you can add a tool to transfer applications created for bada by connecting <a href="http://developer.samsung.com/bada/repository/add-on/migration-tool/">an additional repository</a> . <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/027/da2/880/027da28806d5b9dbbd3d4a862e298181.png" alt="Tizen ide"></div><br><br>  But there are other development tools that support Tizen.  For example, <a href="http://html5dev-software.intel.com/">Intel XDK</a> , a cross-platform development tool using HTML5, and the <a href="http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/technical-reference-intel-html5-app-porter-tool-beta">Intel HTML5 App Porter Tool</a> , which allows you to convert iOS software to HTML5 applications.  You can design, prototype, and debug interfaces using <a href="http://download.tizen.org/misc/media/conference2013/slides/TDC2013-Tizen_UX_Layout_and_Compositor.pdf">Tizen UX Layouter &amp; Composer</a> .  It is also important to note that the development of games for Tizen was supported by Havok ( <a href="http://download.tizen.org/misc/media/conference2013/slides/TDC2013-Project_Anarchy.pdf">Project Anarchy</a> ), Unity Technologies ( <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> ), Marmalade ( <a href="http://www.madewithmarmalade.com/marmaladesdk/features/phonegap-compliance">PhoneGap</a> ), Game Salad and YoYo Games, by adapting their engines and tools.  And developers using the popular Qt toolkit should be interested in a fast-paced <a href="http://qtfortizen.blogspot.ru/">project designed to make Qt applications work on devices with Tizen</a> . <br><br><h4>  Earn Money with Tizen </h4><br>  As it has become accepted now, Tizen has its own application store - Tizen Store, which was developed by Samsung.  The corresponding program will be pre-installed on each device.  The client part of the Tizen Store is not yet available, but the developers have already been given the opportunity to download applications in the <a href="">seller office</a> .  This allows the former to occupy a relatively free niche for the application market.  Tizen Store can host HTML5 applications, native and hybrid.  In the future we plan to support other multimedia content.  The key features of the store are the fast process of analyzing downloadable applications, which takes no more than three days, and the high share of the developer's profit from the sale of applications is 70%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7fc/f58/6ab/7fcf586abc591d9769f2d5f1fe53a8b8.png" alt="Tizen store"><br><br>  Also in the world there are contests and hackathons for Tizen developers.  For example, on the 10th of July, the <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/contests/tizen-app-challenge">Tizen App Challenge began</a> , the acceptance of which will end on the 1st of November.  A distinctive feature of this competition are huge cash prizes - a total fund of more than $ 4 million!  54 winners will be selected in nine nominations (3 gaming and 6 non-gaming).  In addition, developers of the top ten HTML5 apps will receive additional prizes.  This is a great opportunity to get a valuable reward for your abilities, hurry to participate! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7a3/2ef/71c/7a32ef71c62d1db55c1cf6ec3d7c8969.png" alt="Tizen App Challenge"><br><br><h4>  Tizen on the internet </h4><br>  The main resource with information about Tizen is <a href="https://www.tizen.org/ru">Tizen.org</a> , supported by the Linux Foundation.  It consists of several sections: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.tizen.org/ru">the main page</a> contains general information, news and announcements of upcoming events, </li><li>  On <a href="https://developer.tizen.org/ru">the developer page,</a> you can download the SDK, view the documentation and participate in forum discussions, </li><li>  <a href="https://source.tizen.org/ru">The source code page is</a> about developing the Tizen platform and porting it to devices. </li></ul><br>  In addition, there is a <a href="https://bugs.tizen.org/jira/secure/Dashboard.jspa">bugtracker</a> and a <a href="http://wiki.tizen.org/">section for wiki articles</a> . <br><br>  This concludes my introductory article, and I invite you to follow Tizen on <a href="https://twitter.com/TizenRussia">Twitter</a> and <a href="http://vk.com/club40679987">VKontakte</a> . <br><br>  <i>Cyril Chuvilin,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Tizen Russian Community Manager, Intel Corporation</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="">kirillx.v.chuvilin@intel.com</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/187706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/187706/</a></p>
