Expected leader of the list was the company Yandex with an estimated value of $ 7.6 billion. Mail.ru Group ranked second with an estimated value of $ 4 billion, and the third place was taken by Avito with $ 2.549 billion. <br><br>  Between the third and fourth place of the list, there was a gap of more than $ 2.1 billion. The Internet-trading company Wildberries is estimated at ‚Äúonly‚Äù $ 413 million. The list also includes such companies as Ozon Group, Yulmart, Citylink, Headhunter, Aviasales, Mamba and even Internet cinema Ivi.ru. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In addition to the aforementioned giants Yandex, Mail.ru Group and Avito, the top ten included six online trading companies.  Internet services, which in theory should bring more profits to their owners than trading platforms, are located at the end of the list.

      It is necessary to mention the very strange indicators of some other participants.  For example, the Kupivip service ranked 16th in the rating with an estimated value of $ 97 million. At the same time, the company, according to the Forbes card itself, attracted $ 127 million of investments, that is, its estimated value is paradoxically lower than the money already invested in it.  The same applies to Ozon Group, which is located in fifth place with an estimate of $ 302 million (attracted investment of $ 271 million since 2000) and Lamoda, which is in sixth place in the rating with an estimate of $ 301 million (attracted investment of $ 211.67 million since 2012). <br><br>  Suddenly, Ivi.ru‚Äôs audiovisual service was placed on the Forbes list, which ranked 18th in the rating with an estimated value of $ 96 million, overtaking 1C-Bitrix (with 45,000 client organizations using Bitrix24, it costs only $ 86 million) and Ticketland ($ 84.2 million).  However, the online cinema is not so simple.  Like the companies Ozon, Lamoda and Kupivip mentioned above, Ivi.ru was included in the Forbes list at the expense of investments of $ 43.5 million attracted since 2007. <br><br>  In their calculations, Forbes was guided by official data on revenue (excluding VAT), which the companies themselves provided to the tax authorities.  Experts and analysts were also involved in the work.  Foreign assets and companies operating mainly offline but having large Internet sites (for example, Russian Railways or Aeroflot) were excluded from the rating. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373211/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373211/</a></p>
