  <section class="page js-page"><h1>RobZone robot vacuum cleaners. Have you heard of these?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About iRobot writing is no longer interesting.  Many know about him.  Therefore, in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/robot/119413/">last article I</a> wrote about the robots for iClebo Smart vacuum cleaners.  Now I will tell about the robot vacuum cleaners completely unknown to the Russian public: RobZone. <br><br>  RobZone is an Austrian company, although the production, as in iRobot, in China.  In fact, in European countries, the company's models are quite widespread.  By the beginning of 2011, RobZone employees realized that they had to open their representative office in Russia, which they did with success. <br><br>  The most current models: <a href="http://roboticslab.ru/product787501941/">RobZone Gold</a> , <a href="http://roboticslab.ru/product789075964/">RobZone Silver</a> and RobZone Emotion.  I visited the Gold model in my hands, but I will also tell you about the differences between these models. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fad/43e/b10/fad43eb1082b8b3e1bbde1c72c881336.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>RobZone Emotion</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ac/bb8/582/8acbb85827ee537c7386b188ebaed15e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It is the youngest model of the family.  But even the youngest model is supplied with a remote control, unlike many iRobot vacuum cleaners for the same price.  Moreover, this model can be programmed for a week.  What does it mean?  You set the time of cleaning and go to work.  In your absence, the robot is removed, and get back to the base for recharging.  All you have to do is clean the dust bin.  In terms of build quality, in my personal opinion, the model is better assembled than the more expensive counterparts.  An interesting feature of all "RobZones" is the presence of an ultraviolet lamp in the lower part of the body.  The lamp, according to the manufacturer, disinfects, kills germs and ticks, which can bring pets.

      The cost of Emotion is comparable to the younger models of iRobot, for example, the series 531, 533. At the same time, the latter are not programmed, without a remote control, without a UV lamp. <br><br>  <b>Verdict</b> : a good choice for those who are looking for an inexpensive but fully functional alternative to low-cost iRobot models. <br><br>  <b>RobZone Silver</b> - different from Emotion more capacious dust collector (1 liter, like the top iRobot), the presence of the display, 5-speed cleaning system (instead of 4x), can be supplemented with the function of wiping the floors with an antistatic cloth (by purchasing the accessory). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/df0/85e/3bd/df085e3bde14fb58fff51bfe2fea4cec.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If we draw an analogy with the models of iRobot, then the model is similar to the iRobot 55x, only has almost twice the larger dust collector and a remote control in the kit. <br><br>  <b>Verdict</b> : A good alternative to iRobot if the cleaning area is over 60 square meters. <br><br>  And finally, the top model of the line, which was able to be tested in real conditions: <b>RobZone Gold</b> . <br><br>  <b>Body</b>  Made, oddly enough, in the case of golden hue.  Sufficiently high-quality materials, but still, with iRobot and iClebo plastic seems to be more rigid and durable.  Generally, if we talk about build quality, then the leader is iRobot, iClebo and Neato go second, then everyone else (for Samsung, Electrolux, Karcher I can‚Äôt say anything, I haven‚Äôt seen them).  The front bumper absorbs impacts against obstacles and is made of rubberized material.  Furniture will definitely not spoil.  Dimensions 350 x 110 mm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e31/318/d89/e31318d89f0e278a481cfb501ee9e90d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  At the bottom is a rubber and rotating brushes, a UV lamp, a side brush, and anti-drop sensors.  In this model, you can install a microfiber cloth that will wipe the floors.  I pay attention that he will not wash the floors, even if you moisten it.  First, it is necessary to moisten regularly.  And secondly, in Gold, a less dense cloth is used than in iCelbo and in principle it is not recommended to moisten it.  It is useful only for cleaning smooth floors from fine dust.  Although he would rather blow it out from under him than wipe it.  In general, the accessory is dubious. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/10b/73b/b75/10b73bb754af684628561da6702012ff.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the top of the robot vacuum cleaner there is an LCD display with useful information about: cleaning mode (there are 7 of them, by the way), battery charge, errors that have occurred, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/32d/566/448/32d566448a36adf5c385a6df93224a6c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The filtering system is located on the back surface of the vacuum cleaner so that the dust from the dust collector does not come out.  Unlike younger models, Gold has 5 stages of filtration and uses a filter with silver nanoparticles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3f3/003/cf7/3f3003cf7d173140fa27b472e2840ed2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <b>Functions.</b> <br>  The functional features of the Gold model correspond to the top models of competitors, in particular: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Dust collector volume 1 liter.  This means that it will easily remove 4 rooms and the dust collector will probably not be full by this point. <br>  ‚Ä¢ UV lamp for disinfection. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The display on the top of the case + remote control included. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to program on days of the week. <br>  ‚Ä¢ 7 cleaning modes <br>  ‚Ä¢ Li-ION battery (iRobot NiMH lives less) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Good accessory kit. <br><br>  <b>Accessories.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/228/92c/ac4/22892cac44ad10e2cc695b81d548992f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the RobZone Gold box you will find: 2 virtual walls, charging base, remote control, spare anti-static wipe, side brush, active carbon filter and nano-silver, base power adapter, cleaning brush.  Interestingly, an additional brush and virtual wall is offered as a separate bag.  That is, there are no special places in the foam box for them. <br><br>  <b>How is he cleaned?</b> <br>  Now the fun part.  As they say, it's better to see once than hear a hundred times.  I have prepared a small video of the vacuum cleaner for review. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tRwMTA3CRo&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhg2mI92AKtwtCKR8JuTGIbv9yakTA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The noise level is comparable to iRobot and works a little louder than iClebo.  It can work completely autonomously, as well as be controlled with the help of a remote control.  If the battery charge is over during operation, it will recharge and will start cleaning from the place where it stopped, due to the fact that it remembers the route that it was cleaning. <br><br>  Sensors against shocks and falls from a height work with a bang.  If you put the robot on the table.  He will not fall from it.  Absorption power is one and a half times higher than standard iRobot.  The average room cleaning time (15-18 squares) will be about 30-35 minutes. <br><br>  <b>Verdict.</b>  Good top model among cleaning robots.  It will easily compete with its rivals. <br><br><h6>  Ps.  RobZone Gold robot vacuum cleaner was kindly provided for the test by the online store <a href="http://roboticslab.ru/">RoboticsLab.Ru</a> </h6></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121055/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121055/</a></p>
