      <b>Compact flagship</b> <br><br>  It seems that the battle for the diagonal of the screen gradually changes direction.  The race for inches pleases not all users and those who would like to get a smartphone with top features and a screen smaller than 5 inches are getting bigger.  I personally know a few people who still use the Xperia S and Arc S before the end of the year and refuse to upgrade just because of the impressive dimensions of modern flagship devices.  For this audience, first of all, the new model from Sony is designed - Xperia Z1 Compact. <br>  Unlike smaller versions of the flagship smartphones of many manufacturers, which, often, are in some way curtailed, the Xperia Z1 Compact is no different from the Xperia Z1, absolutely nothing, except, in fact, sizes.  All the other advantages of the ‚Äúbig brother‚Äù, including the most powerful 20-megapixel camera, the four-core Snapdragon 800 processor, the Adreno 330 video accelerator, 2 GB of RAM are in place.  The diagonal of the IPS display is 4.3 inches favorite by many, and the resolution is 1280x720.  The device is available in several versions - not only in traditional black and white, but also in yellow and pink colors, which makes it attractive not only for respectable citizens, but also for fashionistas. <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> : 4.3-inch, 1280x720 <br>  <b>Processor</b> : Snapdragon 800 2.2 GHz quad-core <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 2 GB RAM, 16 GB internal, SD card slot <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 2300 mAh <br>  <b>Body color</b> : white, black, pink, yellow <br><br>  <b>Loud and proud</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c51/4b6/5af/c514b65af2427460266c6f9574b8b61a.jpg"><br><br>  The following novelty is designed for those who missed the Walkman series music phones.  The new model Sony Xperia E1 is able to cause you warm nostalgic feelings, adding to their enthusiasm for modern technology.  The four-inch smartphone is equipped with a powerful speaker that provides volume up to 100 dB, as well as a special button to start the player and switch tracks.  The ‚ÄúShake to shuffle‚Äù function allows you to mix songs by simply shaking the phone, and with the ClearAudio + and xLOUD software technologies provide high-quality playback of any music at maximum volume.  In addition, the Xperia E1 feels great surrounded by Sony's wireless gadgets, such as the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/207592">SRS BTV5</a> speaker system or the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/184454">SBH50</a> headset, for <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/184454">example</a> .  By the way, it is offered as an option with one SIM-card, and with two! <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> : 4-inch, 800x480 <br>  <b>Processor</b> : Qualcomm MSM8210 1.2 GHz dual-core <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 512 MB RAM, 4 GB internal, SD card slot (???) <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 1700 mAh <br>  <b>Body Color</b> : White, Black, Purple <br><br>  <b>Big one</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b21/6ef/84b/b216ef84b2c5fcc6b522b919944612a4.jpg"><br><br>  If the Xperia E1 is designed primarily for music lovers and compact devices, then the next novelty is that the Xperia T2 Ultra will delight those who love huge screens and cannot live without movies and videos.  The six-inch Triluminos screen no one would call small!  However, unlike the flagship giant Xperia Z Ultra, this model belongs to the average price category and anyone can afford it.  However, accessibility does not go to the detriment of performance, for which the quad-core processor is responsible.  The 13-megapixel camera is equipped with additional features, such as the Portrait Retouch, which allows you to make perfect self-portraits or the Background Defocus, with which you can create the effect of blurring the background, like in SLR cameras.  For such solid dimensions, a powerful battery is required, so a 3000 mAh battery is installed in the T2 Ultra.  Developed versions with one and two SIM cards. <br><br>  <b>Screen</b> : 6-inch, 233 ppi, 1280x720 <br>  <b>Processor</b> : Quad-core Snapdragon 400 MSM8928 <br>  <b>Memory</b> : 1 GB RAM, 8 GB internal, SD card slot <br>  <b>Battery</b> : 3000 mAh <br>  <b>Camera</b> : Exmor RS 13 MP <br>  <b>Body Color</b> : White, Black, Purple <br><br>  <b>Bracelet for bloggers</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f7/63f/908/6f763f908870365652ca653aec9110d6.jpg"><br><br>  Now a little about the SmartBand bracelet.  At first glance it may seem that this is another sports tracker that measures the distance traveled and calories burned.  Yes, he can do it too, but, unlike analogs, the SmartBand is designed not only for sports, but also for everyday life, allowing you to keep detailed statistics on all your daily activities (and not only actions ‚Äî inaction is also taken into account).  In a special application LifeLog will be recorded not only your morning jogging, charging or cycling, but also a trip by bus or a few hours in front of a computer or TV. <br>  In addition, the bracelet is able to follow the sleep cycles, and also allows you to control the player and answer incoming calls.  The device is protected from water and is available in nine colors.  The platform will be open to third-party developers, so you should expect absolutely incredible applications to appear, as was the case, for example, with the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/sonyxperia/blog/205912">SmartWatch 2</a> watch. <br>  Using SmartBand is possible not only for fitness and entertainment, but also for time management - collecting information on how a day goes by allows you to more efficiently manage your time or, at least, to get a better idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat you spent on it. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/3CMiSK7ENlA%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh34w4G0Mx6d8qI8fTm7_8ooejbOw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209420/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209420/</a></p>
