  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tablet holder on a treadmill or search for free steps</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About 10 thousand steps to be taken daily heard by anyone who is at least a little interested in health.  Everything is clear and logical here - the more you move, the healthier you will be and vice versa, the more you sit, the sooner you will get mirror disease, back pain and other hemorrhoids in every sense of the word.  After my friends gave me a fitness tracker, I clearly saw that I was moving a little: 2 - 3 thousand steps a day.  I wanted to change this, but in practice the question arose: where to find time to move so much every day?  Sometimes it turns out to be selected for training or walking, but not every day.  In addition, the tracker application in the statistics for the month clearly showed that this happens even less often than I imagined. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dp/ea/cj/dpeacjzglvvojxsrattu2cwk8se.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúDo you want to walk 10 thousand steps a day, go outside and walk 10 thousand steps, what‚Äôs the problem?‚Äù My friend told me.

      On the one hand, everything is like this, but on the other - you have to pay for everything.  And in this case, payment is accepted by the most valuable resource - time.  To get at least some changes, you need to walk for an hour every day, which means I have to ‚Äúpay‚Äù 7 hours a week.  Is it possible for free? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Search for free steps </h3><br>  I started down the stairs instead of the elevator.  It helped, but did not add many steps.  Then I decided to use all the possibilities in order to move to the maximum without allocating special time for this.  From that moment on, I not only descended the stairs, but also climbed.  At first, my wife did not support me, and this experience gave me two interesting discoveries.  The first was that even when walking up to the 6th floor, my time is not lost.  Our elevator is stupid, and if we start with it at the same time, then on the 6th it comes only 10 seconds earlier than me.  And since quite often the elevator still needs to wait, in practice it often happened that I had time to open the door and take off my shoes when my wife was just coming to the floor.  The second discovery was not so pleasant - I noticed that when walking on foot, my breath is already lost on the 3rd floor.  It sucks, but it‚Äôs good though I didn‚Äôt take it so late and still able to climb without a lift at all! <br><br>  Besides mastering the stairs, I began to park in a different way.  Previously, like most, I was looking for a place closer to the entrance to the porch or shop, and now, on the contrary, I am taking a place further away.  There, too, time does not disappear, since, taking up the first available space far from the entrance, there is no need to drive along the entrance or ‚Äúfit‚Äù into a narrow parking space.  Yes, on the way back, you have to carry bags or carry a cart further, but I can still afford it. <br><br><h3>  Until death is healthy </h3><br>  In these ways, I added a total of about 2000 steps a week, and that was where my fantasy ended.  From the outside, it seems that the problem is far-fetched and there is no difficulty in just going out and walking for an hour.  But the fact is that one hour of weather will not do, and in order to get at least some changes, you need to walk an hour every day, and this is already 7 hours a week, which in turn means that I need to stop doing some their affairs, and in quite a significant amount. <br><br>  And then I came across the book ‚ÄúTo death is healthy‚Äù by E.J.Jakobs, where the guy tells how he introduced into his life all sorts of different things considered useful and what came of it.  In one of the chapters, he describes how he attached a table for a laptop to his treadmill, and continued to finish writing the book, walking along it at low speed.  This idea seemed too radical to me, but I decided to try a compromise version - to read while walking.  I love to read and do it regularly, and I have a track.  True, it was not at all clear how to attach a holder to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jj/hn/eq/jjhneq1yg99ubz_gsjvkqv89vtm.jpeg"><br><br>  First, I tested the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwalking while reading, holding a book in my hands.  The hand got tired very quickly, but otherwise it turned out to be quite normal, and I went to Chinese sites.  I needed a tall holder to hold the book at eye level (it‚Äôs not convenient to look down ‚Äî the neck quickly numb) that could be attached to a curved tube of a treadmill and that would be versatile enough for use with both a tablet and a regular book.  Some disappointment awaited me here, since I could not find anything suitable. <br><br>  I had to switch to the DIY version.  In search of ideas, I reviewed a bunch of other people's pictures.  Remarkably, there were quite a few such home-made products, which confirmed the relevance and viability of the idea, but for full copying none of the options appealed to.  It remained to design everything yourself.  My requirements for the holder were as follows: <br><br><ol><li>  Universality (ability to hold a paper book or tablet of any format). </li><li>  Easy installation and removal.  Still, I sometimes use the path to the destination and it is necessary that nothing interfere with running. </li><li>  The holder must not interfere with folding the track.  This is a very important point from the point of view of psychology.  If in order to read on the track you need to do too many manipulations, then in a week I will just score on all these difficulties.  Therefore, everything should be simple - lowered the track, put the book and everything!  And the way out of this occupation should be just as simple - turned off the walkway, picked up the canvas, took the book. </li><li>  Reliability and rigidity.  That the book could not fall and that the book does not shake from the movement.  For this reason, by the way, the option of flimsy brackets with ali has disappeared. </li><li>  The possibility of at least a small adjustment of the angle of inclination and height. </li></ol><br>  I decided to start with a layout that was made of cardboard left over from Ikea furniture and scotch.  With the help of the layout, I was able to estimate the approximate height, and later this layout served as a template for the manufacture of a real holder. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0p/oj/yb/0pojybygudbqhg7mbstv6gm7g6k.jpeg"><br><br>  Over the weekend, managed to collect just such a design.  If you want to run, it is easily removed, and then put back with one hand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ad/p6/u1/adp6u1odxf1x-r8lec9xktjqo8m.jpeg"><br><br>  At first, I planned to paint it black or white, immediately after rolling in and I would be sure that I should leave such a ‚Äúraskoryak‚Äù at home, but later I got used to it and now I use it as it is.  Now my holder is more than a year old and I can say that the idea turned out to be viable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/y5/4b/7n/y54b7ntxewfax5srj1k9i3dmpsw.jpeg"><br><br>  As planned, the bookholder does not interfere with raising the canvas to standby mode. <br><br><h3>  What about the eyes? </h3><br>  At first there was a slight fear that this could somehow negatively affect the vision, but now it (this fear) is not.  Yes, I, of course, heard about the dangers of reading in the transport, but when I understood the question, I did not find a single study proving that it was reading while moving that damages the vision.  It is harmful to overstrain the eyes, and this happens when a person reads too small a font with dim or blinking lighting in a Soviet electric train.  Well, or when absolutely shakes so that the look strays from the line.  The electric track has no such problems.  The tablet allows you to set a comfortable font, and with the lighting at home, everything is clear.  At first I walked at a speed of about 1 km / h, but very quickly switched to 2.5-3, which turned out to be more comfortable for me.  In addition, I do not read on the track more than one hour a day.  Feelings about the eyes were in vain. <br><br><h3>  Impressions of use </h3><br>  Now, about a year after the described changes, I walk on average about 7 thousand steps a day, not allocating any additional time for this.  I still don‚Äôt know where to take time for another 3,000, and although when walking up to the 6th floor, my breath still stumbles, but this happens already on the 5th, not on the 3rd.  There is progress! <br><br>  All health! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/448596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/448596/</a></p>
