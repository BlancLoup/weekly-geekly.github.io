  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Space network data center</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Los Angeles-based company Cloud Constellation announced that by 2019 it plans to create the first network of servers for storing petabytes of data in Earth orbit.  The satellite group of a company called SpaceBelt will not only transmit data via satellite communications, but also store them in space. <br><br>  Data centers and cables on Earth are susceptible to hacking, as well as subject to national legislation and government access to information.  The network of satellite servers SpaceBelt will not be connected to any other networks, it will remain physically and legally inaccessible for any outside interference.  This will ensure a higher level of security and reliability of data storage in the space system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/50d/f4c/ceb/50df4ccebeff45418f3ccb776d95aa8c.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a>  Cloud Constellation CEO Scott Sobani (Scott Sobani) said that the constellation of SpaceBelt satellites can be viewed as a huge SSD disk or a network of data processing centers connected by high-speed communication lines.  This will be an array of data storage, but with a location in space. <br><br>  Need to create a new international office?  There is no need to call the local carrier operator or data center.  Cloud Constellation plans to sell SpaceBelt capacity for cloud providers who can provide these services. <br><br>  Security is another important point of the project.  Data centers on satellites are protected from natural disasters such as earthquakes, tornadoes and floods.  Exactly also, they are much more invulnerable to hacker attacks.  SpaceBelt will use the hardware encryption and to connect to the satellite, the attacker will need an improved ground station. <br><br>  According to Sobany: <br><blockquote>  The secret ingredient of Cloud Constellation is technology that we developed to solve the time delay problem between the space system and the ground station.  Users will be able to connect to SpaceBelt space servers in the same way as cloud servers - without a noticeable difference in speed.  The SpaceBelt network will start with 8-9 satellites, gradually expanding and expanding.  Connected satellites will form a computational cloud that will allow you to do such things as video transcoding, bit storage.  Data centers will also be improved with each new level of development of the space station. </blockquote><br>  The company plans to save petabytes of data through a specified network of satellites.  All equipment must be certified for use in space, taking into account the characteristics and specific conditions of the near-Earth orbit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5d3/dc7/be6/5d3dc7be6b5d406a87d5b81523ec79a9.jpeg"><br><br>  According to satellite analyst TMF Associates Tim Farrar (Tim Farrar) most of the computer mechanisms in space is more expensive, while they are inferior to the earth in terms of technical development. <br><br>  But Taneja Group storage analyst Mike Matchett (Mike Matchett) defines the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplacing a petabyte in space, as quite interesting and real.  He believes that the first users of SpaceBelt may be financial companies.  Indeed, the Cloud Constellation claims that their satellites are capable of transmitting information from near-earth orbit to Earth in a quarter of a second, and from one point of our planet to another - in less than a second.  For financial companies, the transfer rate plays a huge role, allowing you to enter into various transactions and contracts as quickly as possible. <br><br>  But Michael Listner, lawyer and founder of Space Law &amp; Policy Solutions, reminds us that transferring data to space does not outlaw it.  According to the space agreement of 1967, the jurisdiction of the country where the satellite is registered extends to it in space.  For example, if a satellite is registered in the United States, the company will have to obey American law and respond to the country's agenda. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17a/b27/3b9/17ab273b916e4bfa88a133f494a4c8f9.png"><br><br>  To date, 1PB of the ground storage system costs more than $ 100 thousand, while it is possible to create ground servers of much greater capacity.  Of course, SpaceBelt will need powerful protection against cosmic radiation, but it is possible to provide a 1B capacity using less than 100 satellites.  Thanks to advances in 3D NAND flash drive technology, by 2019, the number of petabyte satellite group can be halved. <br><br>  The cost of storing data in SpaceBelt is not yet advertised.  But there is no doubt that a cloud in space will cost more to users.  Currently, Cloud Constellation Corporation is conducting a new round of financing and is looking for investors to implement one of the most courageous concepts of cloud storage in the history of information systems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302296/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302296/</a></p>
