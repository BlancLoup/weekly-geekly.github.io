      ‚Ä¢ Railway station <br>  ‚Ä¢ conductor <br>  ‚Ä¢ driver <br>  ‚Ä¢ train <br><br>  But over time, it all went away, because everyone just can not know everything (but for the future, the passenger is only a small fraction of the activities of the railway).  Okay, more to the point.  When you woke up one morning, you decided to go somewhere (to visit a sick aunt, to see friends, to rest, and maybe you should work).  You need to go far and you remember that you are constantly swaying on the bus, and you simply have no money for the plane.  Throwing away the wrong options, you come to one solution - ‚ÄúGoing by train!‚Äù.  Well, congratulations, the right choice. <br><br>  Then you have to buy a ticket for this very train.  Here begins the following: <br>  ‚Ä¢ you can book it by phone <br>  ‚Ä¢ you can book it on the internet <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can order and you will be brought home (in this case, you can safely add the cost of a taxi from the station to you and back to the ticket price) <br>  ‚Ä¢ in the most advanced CIS countries, you can purchase a ticket through a special terminal <br>  ‚Ä¢ but in most cases you will simply come to the checkout and stand in a queue. <br><br>  More recently, some ten years ago, many should remember that buying a ticket for a passing train, you were given it, but with a small reservation - it did not indicate your seat number.  And having entered the train, you were seated by a conductor on a free one, in accordance with the classiness of the ticket you bought.  Now, in times of domination in this area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe ACS EXPRESS-3, we can buy a ticket, for example, in the city N, with a landing in the city M, and at the same time we will know our place (Thus, having persuaded the cashier to sell you the lower shelf, preferably away from the toilet;)). <br><br>  Well, you bought a ticket, boarded the train.  Landing on trains formed by this station begins no later than 30 minutes for departure. <br><br>  The train started moving.  Few know that you have the right to ask the conductor for board games, imagine all sorts of checkers, chess, "space 2000". <br><br>  You had a great time on the trip, got off the car, surely said goodbye to a pleasant conductor and ... and forgot about this trip, forgot how awful a dream, not even, did not forget, it just didn‚Äôt fall into your memory ... and what was there to postpone.  I bought a ticket, went into the train, drove a couple of hours, got off the train. <br><br><h5>  And now let's get a little more with pictures;) </h5><br><br>  Remember, I told you that we can now buy a ticket from one station to another, while in the third.  This is all possible thanks to a single information space, formed according to the following principle: <br>  From each workplace cashier information about tickets sold enters the "center" <br><img src="http://i062.radikal.ru/0907/06/e49b15d4ceca.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Where is the information space formed?  Thus, what appears, let's call it so- "ticket model".  Now I know what's what, the operator receives reliable information that is relevant for a given period of time. <br><img src="http://i078.radikal.ru/0907/6c/24e3973331b4.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The train, after having brought you to its destination, goes to the sump, there he (speaking already about the cars) is washed, cleaned, and so on.  Then changing your number goes back.  Yes, the number he changes.  Since there are two directions on the railway: even and odd.  Let's say it goes there 94, 95 back. Which means that you will never eat back 92.96 and other even ones ... <br><br><h5>  Now the next moment. </h5><br><br>  there is such an opinion that when traveling, for example, from Moscow to Sevastopol (well, for a long distance), the Moscow machinists constantly travel to the Crimea (as if to work).  Well, if someone loves Grishkovets, he, I think, understood what I mean <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ca/87a/50c/0ca87a50c9f7e0e4274338f19e36c1c5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Between Moscow and Sevastopol, for example, there are 3 sections.  And something like the following happens: The train left Moscow for the first section, stopped, there, unnoticeable to your eyes, another locomotive hitched to it and you drove along the second section, and then in the same vein: drove, unhooked, hitched another, drove on.  The locomotive that was uncoupled is attached to another train that is returning.  Thus, taking the train to the sea, we can safely assume that the driver who started to lead you there may never have been to the sea ... <br><br>  Well, thank you for your attention, be good passengers;), and I went home for the weekend, of course, by train! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65300/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65300/</a></p>
