At least, this is true for fruit flies - experiments on them showed that the time limit in which they could eat had a beneficial effect on the work of the heart. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the experiment, one group of flies ate at will, for the second time, food was limited to 12 hours each day.  After three weeks of demarcation, it turned out that flies with a restricted diet slept better, gained less weight, and their hearts were healthier than those of a glutton.  The amount of food eaten by weight in both groups of flies was about the same.  Results persisted for five weeks. <br><br>  One of the researchers said that in the first experiment, examining the hearts of flies, who had limited access to food, scientists marveled at the safety of their hearts.  At first they even decided that they somehow confused these flies with a younger party.  They had to repeat the experiment several times to make sure that it is the temporary restriction of the diet that has this beneficial effect.

      Experiments have shown that even for elderly flies (and the life of these flies is about 60 days), restrictions in the diet led to an improvement in the condition of their hearts. <br><br>  An unexplored connection between the work of the heart and the genes responsible for circadian rhythms was also found.  In the case when a lot of flies were exposed to this diet, in which these genes were turned off, there was no visible improvement of the heart condition. <br><br>  According to the results of previous studies, it is already known that people who tolerate meals in the late hours are more likely to get problems with the cardiovascular system.  Of course, people are not flies, besides, people usually do not eat the same thing every day (except, perhaps, students).  But at least the results of the study open up an interesting context in which we can expand our understanding of the effects of diet and nutrition on health.  For now, better not eat at night. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365235/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365235/</a></p>
