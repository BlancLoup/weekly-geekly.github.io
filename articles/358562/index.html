The main conference hall will be broadcast free on YouTube.  How to get to the broadcast and what will be there, we will tell under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The share of English speakers continues to grow.  Three reports in English will get to the free broadcast - and which ones!  They will be led by two famous figures in the testing world: Simon Stewart and Michael Bolton. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Simon Stewart</b> is the creator of WebDriver, the leader of the Selenium project.  He worked in two dream companies - Facebook and Google, and threw them in order to develop Selenium.  On Facebook, he was head of the build tools team (they developed the Buck system), and before that, he worked for Google for five years and another three for ThoughtWorks.  He knows a lot about unusual things, like mono-repositories and reproducible assemblies.  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/6m4bimfd5kaw4o6cssam6k/">His report is</a> worth listening to, because this is a person who was directly at the origin of many tools that we use every day. </li><li>  <b>Michael Bolton</b> is a tester, consultant, and co-author of RST (along with James Bach).  About him we have a <a href="https://habr.com/company/jugru/blog/354810/">separate article</a> .  Rapid Software Testing is a methodology and mindset that allows you to test under pressure and time constraints.  Michael is the leader of the context-oriented testing movement, having more than twenty years of experience in testing, developing, managing software development.  He currently leads DevelopSense, a consulting company in Toronto.  He has <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/17io9aysrmw88cisuqq86a/">two</a> <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/7zgdkrdbk800wcwsggsa6a/">reports</a> at the conference, which are worth listening to because of the vast practical concentrated experience that he puts into each of his speeches. </li></ul>

      By the way, another famous speaker - <b>Vitaly Friedman</b> , especially for us will hold a report in Russian.  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/3zx0l1uelgac2asiscokki/">‚ÄúTesting to the last‚Äù</a> continues its stories about the development of interfaces, this time it will be told about the problems of responsive user interfaces, the perfect accordion, date and time pointers, comparative tables, and much more. <br><br>  We also clarified a common set of topics, technologies and programming languages.  For example, the dominant framework was Selenium in Java, but on this Heisenbug many new things were added.  Zodod in a free broadcast report got Artem Eroshenko <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/2zwqae0onmsiw0c8e6ooca/">about Allure</a> . <br><br>  Interestingly, the nature of discourse has changed recently, and participants want from the testing conference more and more hardcore reports and less and less traditional topics like load testing.  It seems that everyone has finally learned to do the workload and they want to go further.  So the report <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/6feubdtqqwqocya2w4cwq2/">‚ÄúTesting on the basis of Petri nets‚Äù by</a> Alexey Rodionov about the transition from conventional tests to model-based testing got into the free broadcast. <br><br>  What about other topics?  In Moscow, there was no report about security, <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/chexr4uzvkiqciysaogyo/">and now there will be</a> .  Many reports on unusual topics, two of them were broadcast: <br><br><ul><li>  Anastasia Semenyuk <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/beyolylrla4eq244mg4oi/">will talk</a> about Beta testing on VKontakte, testing large-scale updates and completely new products, developing a community of 12 thousand testers, processing tens of thousands of bug reports and so on. </li><li>  Olga Megorskaya will tell about <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb/6vm8srckjooygusg6quem8/">crowdsourcing in Yandex</a> . </li></ul><br><br>  In general, the conference has grown in size and as reports. <br><br>  We remind you that you <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/online-free/">can</a> watch the broadcast online <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/online-free/">at this link</a> . <br><br>  For those who are too lazy to follow the link to the site, further there is a description of the reports under the spoilers. <br><br><br><hr><h1>  The first day </h1><hr><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Shipping is a risky business</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h1>  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb//6m4bimfd5kaw4o6cssam6k">Shipping is a risky business</a> </h1><br><blockquote><p>  <strong>Program Committee Commentary:</strong> </p><br><p>  <em>Want to hear the opinion of the author of Selenium WebDriver about testing in our world?</em>  <em>Come!</em> </p><br></blockquote><br><p>  Businesses do not write and release software for it.  They write code to meet business needs.  Of course, there is no software, there are no opportunities, missed opportunities, and no normal sprinkling of errors.  It means that the costs of failure to push it out.  Because we‚Äôre human, it‚Äôs not just the fear of risk. </p><br><p>  It is possible to follow this procedure.  In particular, how can you testers contribute as low as possible?  Over the course of this talk, we'll recast the software development lifecycle as a conversation about risk.

And the more products you have and the faster they develop, the more effort you need to spend on it. </p><br><p>  Over the past year, we have learned how to scale up the manual testing tasks for most Yandex products with the help of assessors - remote employees working part-time on a piece-rate basis, and now more than 700 assessors take part in testing our products in addition to full-time testers. </p><br><p>  In the report we will tell: </p><br><ul><li>  how it was possible to make the tasks of manual testing as formalized as possible and train them to hundreds of remote employees; </li><li>  how it was possible to put the process on industrial rails, to ensure testing in various environments, to withstand the SLA in speed and quality; </li><li>  what difficulties we faced and how they were solved (and some have not yet decided); </li><li>  how test assessors contributed to the development of Yandex products, how it affected the frequency of releases and the number of bugs skipped. </li></ul><br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/405/457/8e2/4054578e2dc145f6c8028f25f9af20b8.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Olga Megorskaya</b> / Yandex <br><br><p>  Head of the Tolok crowdsourcing platform and management of expert evaluations of Yandex. </p><br><p>  Currently he is responsible for automating, scaling and applying crowdsourcing in various areas and projects in Yandex: data collection for artificial intelligence training, call centers, customer support services, content moderation, data production for maps, translations, and many others. <br>  One of the recent projects is the construction of manual testing processes using crowdsourcing. </p><br><p>  His area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest is mathematics in the world of expert assessments, the author of reports and articles on this topic. </p><br><br clear="all"><hr></div></div><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Testing based on Petri nets</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h1>  <a href="https://heisenbug-piter.ru/talks/2018/spb//6feubdtqqwqocya2w4cwq2">Testing based on Petri nets</a> </h1><br><blockquote><p>  <strong>Program Committee Commentary:</strong> </p><br><p>  <em>The use of a mathematical apparatus for creating tests can be called Test 2.0.</em>  <em>Alexey will tell how this problem was solved on his project, will show alternative ways of developing tests using graph theory.</em> </p><br></blockquote><br><p>  What to do when tests are fundamentally incapable of finding errors that occur during unusual states of the system under test, usually called the ‚Äúedge cases‚Äù?  Is it possible to increase the test coverage and find more errors without creating unnecessary tests and without sacrificing the time to complete them? </p><br><p>  In this report we will talk about how we encountered this problem in Toptal, started the transition from conventional tests to model-based testing, which problems we encountered on this way, why we use Petri nets instead of state machines, and what we got in the end .  The report will be illustrated with examples of Petri nets and a variety of Ruby-code. </p><br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b7/5ec/89d/1b75ec89d4a66d21fd02cb1e53d0d64f.jpg" width="200" align="left">  <b>Alexey Rodionov</b> / Toptal <br><br><p>  He has been testing for more than 11 years, of which for the last 5 years he has been helping to improve quality in Toptal, the world's largest distributed community of high-class specialists.

In this case, UI tests are most often written separately for each platform.  Very often, we get different frameworks, test runners, sometimes even languages, and at the same time support for this zoo.  Then, with changes in product behavior, you have to change the same thing in several places. </p><br><p>  Let's see how, based on open source solutions, you can quickly organize E2E tests that will work both on the web and in mobile applications, as well as what difficulties will arise with a similar solution.  The approach will be demonstrated on the Python stack, but can be easily transferred to another stack. <br>  #python #web #mobile </p><br><br clear="all"><br clear="all"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d5f/9ed/22c/d5f9ed22c3703390342b88e49afe4dfa.png" width="200" align="left">  <b>Igor Balagurov</b> / Uptick <br><br><p> Last year, Igor is engaged in automated testing in the Uptick startup.
