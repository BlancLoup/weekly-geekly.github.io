Colleagues recently wrote on this blog that <a href="https://yandex.ru/promo/academy/shri%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">the registration has opened for</a> the next UI School in Moscow.  I am very pleased with the new recruitment, because I was one of those who invented the School in 2012, and since then I have been constantly engaged in it.  She evolved.  A whole mini-generation of developers came out of it with the broadest outlook and the ability to take on projects in general, everything related to the frontend.  Some graduates work in Yandex, others do not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/el/-x/lt/el-xltxpnkdxe0f__rg9fp0exxc.jpeg"><br><br>  SRI - as a service: it also requires different formats of interaction, automation and experiments.  Here about it also we will talk today on Habr√©.  There will be useful links for candidates.

    <a name="habracut"></a><hr><br>  I do not want to repeat much: all the basic information about SRI 2019 is on the site.  Let me just remind you of the opportunities for children from other cities: indicate in the application form if you want to complete the first part (from September 7 to October 25) in absentia.  Of course, we will not refuse to full-time participation to those who cope with the test task - we will pay for the hostel and meals. <br><br>  We invite in SRI all who are interested in front-end development and are experiencing an acute shortage of practice.  During the School, students gain experience in team development, learn systems thinking and pump the skills necessary for future work in Yandex and similar companies.  Career track graduates SRI looks like this: first, they become junior developers, then developers and eventually team leaders. <br><br>  This will be the seventh School in Moscow and the fourteenth if you consider all the cities where it was conducted - Simferopol, Minsk, Yekaterinburg, St. Petersburg.  We have a flexible project.  Every time we listen to students' feedback: we change something, we remove, we add based on their needs and changes in the industry. <br><br><h3>  Start date </h3><br>  We make the introductory task quite complicated.  The meaning of the task for recruiting in Moscow is similar to what <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/yandex/blog/454584/">was in</a> this <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/yandex/blog/454584/">SRI in Minsk</a> .  We will give a problem on a dynamic layout, on writing JavaScript, and you will need to understand the new domain.  According to our calculations, it will take 5-7 days to complete, maybe a little more. <br><br>  After enrollment, participants must go through two stages.  In the first one, students listen to lectures, do homework, and then disassemble them, along with teachers and other students, right in the classroom.  It turns out a powerful synergy effect. <br><br>  One of the lectures necessarily takes place in a much more intensive format than the others.  On it, we deal with algorithms: for several hours in a row, students practice key algorithmic techniques. <br><br>  During the second stage, the participants unite with each other into small teams and work in the hackathon mode (we call them shrikatons).  All the second stage, students work on real projects under the mentoring of Yandex employees.  In the final - the protection of projects.  The most successful have a real chance to get into production. <br><br>  This was not always the case. <br><br><h3>  How did the SRI change </h3><br>  For the first time we held a school in 2012.  Initially, the idea was that we ourselves lacked specialists and we decided to ‚Äúgrow‚Äù them.  But even then, we didn‚Äôt restrict students to where they work afterwards.  It is important to solve the high-level task - to strengthen a large ecosystem, returning graduates to it with an acquired deep understanding of the frontend.  At conferences and meetings with developers you can see how this process is bearing fruit. <br><br><h4>  Formats and software </h4><br>  There used to be only lectures with homework and defense of the graduation project.  And the lectures are wide, designed for a basic level of students' knowledge.  Gradually, we realized that this is not so much sense.  All information is already available online, it is more important to motivate students to find the necessary information themselves, ask them the right vector and generally instill a desire to learn.  In addition, over the years of the SRI, we have accumulated a lot of material on basic topics, and we regularly update it. <br><br>  Now we concentrate more on public analysis of homework.  This is an important part of the educational process.  Joint analysis of the most common problems in each of the topics after each lecture helps in practice to consolidate the material. <br><br>  When the format of shrikatons was invented, it gave a boost to the process.  Before that, students prepared graduation projects at home alone.  We thought that it would be more efficient to pump team work.  This skill is just hard to get if you are a beginner interface developer who works in a small company, and even more so if you are a freelancer.  There are mentors from Yandex on the shrikatons in each team - experienced developers, they help students to establish relationships and build a working process. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rr/zf/_w/rrzf_wrtqhj4pmwzyqxzrwjgxo8.jpeg" width="600"><br><h5>  <sup><sub>One of the shrikatons</sub></sup> </h5><br>  We also tried the format of integrated schools when we were working in the context of ‚ÄúMobilization‚Äù - an educational project for the development of mobile products in 2017.  Students of the SRI, the School of Managers, the School of Mobile Development and the School of Mobile Design were combined into teams at the same time. <br><br>  This year we want to repeat something like this: we will create mixed teams from SRI and students from the Backend Development <a href="https://yandex.ru/promo/academy/backend-school%3Futm_source%3Dhabr">School</a> . <br><br><h4>  Test verification </h4><br>  Each year, the test task becomes a little more difficult for applicants, and checking it is a little easier for us.  Dozens of applications came to the first school - we checked them manually then.  This year there will be about two thousand applications.  We had to optimize the verification process: we made a single check-list and distributed the verification of tasks among a large number of people.  At the last SRI we have already tried, and on this one we will strengthen various automation and semi-automation of the verification process.  For example, we will use autotests for quicker work checking, before giving them for peer review to a developer. <br><br><h4>  Team </h4><br>  In the organization and conduct of SRI involved about a hundred people.  These are developers of interfaces from all of Yandex from all departments, even from business units.  Someone helps to compose a program, someone lectures or supervises shrikatony.  Since there are a lot of organizers, this does not greatly hinder the current work tasks of the employees.  For them, there is also a benefit: they learn to teach others, to mentor and, in general, to do more complex projects.  Win-win. <br><br><h3>  People </h3><br>  As in our vacancies and internships, there are no age restrictions.  We are waiting for university students and specialists who have minimal front-end development experience.  For us it is important that a person has the desire and ability to learn. <br><br>  A student of SRI is in a borderline state: he already knows something and is able, but he may lack system knowledge and experience in team development in large companies, he lacks practice.  SRI does not teach from scratch. <br><br>  In this case, you can not be just a front-end, but be engaged, for example, in design, technical project management or backend development.  In any case, if your knowledge and experience is enough to perform the test task, it makes sense to go to study in SRI.  In-depth knowledge of the frontend will allow you to better understand the problematic of your colleagues. <br><br>  If every designer and manager we work with had such a level of understanding of interface development, everyone would definitely be better off. <br><br>  Over the years of the School, we noticed that the developers who come to work at Yandex from SRI show excellent results on the internal review. <br><br>  We associate this with the fact that Shrishnikov has the right way of thinking and the archetype of the student.  They look at the world with open eyes, do not hesitate to ask if something is incomprehensible.  They are able to work independently and easily unite with others. <br><br><h3>  From other cities </h3><br>  We bring students from all over Russia, because active study and living together with like-minded people creates a very intensive regime - thereby pulling them out of the home context.  It is like a summer camp, a student hostel, or a popular coliving format.  Some participants from Moscow are jealous and ask to be hooked up with fellow students in a hostel. <br><br><h4>  Part time education </h4><br>  This year, the first stage with lectures and homework can be done in absentee mode, remotely - directly from your city.  But at the second stage it is necessary to come to Moscow, since the magic of teamwork begins further.  While we do not know how many places will be available for remote training.  Here the psychological moment of group dynamics is important, it is important to feel the involvement in the group. <br><br>  We want students who study on the same stream, communicate with each other, become friends.  If half of the applicants learn remotely, and the flow is too large, for example, 100 people, then there will be an unpleasant effect of being alone in a crowd.  Therefore, on one stream, we usually have 30-40 students. <br><br><h3>  Statistics transitions in Yandex </h3><br>  From each stream of the last years we take on internships and vacancies from 60% to 70% of graduates. <br><br>  A total of 539 students studied at SRI, 244 of them became employees of Yandex (not counting those who were only on internships).  Now the company has 163 graduates. <br><br>  Since last year‚Äôs Schools, we have employed 59 people in the company: 29 interns, 30 full-time developers.  Graduates work in a variety of Yandex services: Direct, Search, Mail, home page, Market, Geoservices, Auto, Zen, Metric, Health, Money. <br><br><h3>  BEM and hybrid approach to mobile development </h3><br>  SRI is not tied to BEM.  Of course, if we talk about the development of interfaces, we mean the one that has developed in Yandex - that is, large loads, many users, high quality standards and attention to detail.  Even to create small regional sites, it is important to understand the foundation of the profession, to understand what can be saved and why, and what is not.  At the request of students, we devoted one of the lectures to BEM, since this methodology has become a standard in many places. <br><br>  We teach exactly web development and related technologies, as well as mobile development and mobile layout in the context of web technologies, we use a hybrid approach to creating applications.  Therefore, in SRI, we are not concerned with aspects of native programming in Swift, Objective-C, Cocoa, C ++, Java.  Also, do not touch the development of React Native. <br><br><h3>  Open webinar </h3><br>  This Wednesday, June 19, at 19:00 Moscow time, my colleagues and I will organize a webinar about the School - we will answer the questions of those who are thinking of enrolling or have already started to do the task (of course, I will also come to the comments on this post).  <a href="https://youtu.be/XpxxRG_xOyk">Here is a link</a> to YouTube, you can click "Remind". <br><br><h3>  What to read to prepare </h3><br>  <b>Useful sites</b> <br><br>  - <a href="https://clck.ru/6K3wa">Modern JavaScript Tutorial</a> <br>  - <a href="http://webref.ru/">WebReference</a> <br><br>  <b>Books</b> <br><br>  - <a href="http://ya.cc/307Nc">javascript.</a>  <a href="http://ya.cc/307Nc">Detailed Manual (6th edition), David Flanagan</a> <br>  - <a href="http://ya.cc/307P2">Perfect code, Steve McConnell</a> <br>  - <a href="http://ya.cc/307QK">Refactoring.</a>  <a href="http://ya.cc/307QK">Improving existing code, Martin Fowler</a> <br>  - <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/ru/v2/">Git Book</a> <br><br>  <b>Udacity Courses</b> ( <a href="http://udacity.com/courses/all">link</a> ) <br><br>  - Linux Command Line Basics <br>  - Browser Rendering Optimization <br>  - Website Performance Optimization <br>  - javascript <br>  - Networking for Web Developers <br>  - HTML5 Canvas <br>  - Responsive Images <br>  - Responsive Web Design Fundamentals <br>  - Offline Web Applications <br>  - Web Tooling &amp; Automation <br>  - JavaScript Testing <br>  - Intro to Progressive Web Apps <br>  - Software Testing <br>  - Object-Oriented JavaScript <br><br>  <b>Video</b> <br><br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/%25D0%25A4%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4">Yandex Academy Channel</a> <br>  - <a href="https://academy.yandex.ru/events/frontend/">Materials SRI</a> <br>  - <a href="https://ya.cc/308EQ">Screencast by Node.js</a> <br>  - <a href="https://ya.cc/308EW">Webpack screencast</a> <br>  - <a href="https://ya.cc/308Eu">Gulp screencast</a> <br>  - <a href="https://ya.cc/308F0">Essentials of ES6</a> <br>  - <a href="https://ya.cc/308Fq">Javascript Tutorial For Beginners</a> <br>  - <a href="https://ya.cc/308G6">Javascript Fundamentals</a> <br>  - <a href="https://ya.cc/308G8">Modular Javascript</a> <br>  - <a href="https://ya.cc/308Gi">React JS Tutorials</a> <br>  - <a href="https://ya.cc/308HU">Redux Tutorials</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/learncodeacademy/playlists">LearnCode.academy</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCY10FZglXJ8RL3xB04VpykQ/playlist">CodeDojo</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/iliakan/playlists">javascript.ru</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleDevelopers/playlists">Google Developers</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TechDaysRussia/playlists">Microsoft Developer</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FacebookDevelopers/playlists">Facebook Developers</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TPMGTU/playlists">Technostrim Mail.Ru Group</a> <br>  - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Intuitube/playlists">NOU INTUIT</a> <br><br>  And you can try yourself in solving problems on <a href="https://codesignal.com/">CodeSignal</a> . <br><br>  This is not a complete list, there are many more useful materials.
