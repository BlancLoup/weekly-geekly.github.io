Here we will talk about the service that we have created and which we do not stop improving.  By the way, there is a surprise in the text of the article, so we recommend reading it to the end.  It‚Äôs hard for us to remain objective, because developing Fixico - a solution for optimizing work and protecting computers and devices - we tried to make it advanced in terms of technology and as simple as possible for the user.  Even your grandmother can easily figure it out.  Although it is too much.  Fixico will do everything himself. <br><br>  <b>So what is Fixico?</b> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started in 2012, when we decided to create a service that replaces many individual applications that can make the life of a regular user easier, saving him time and effort.  Often, users are not ready to independently solve computer problems, maintain, install updates, manage antivirus and antispyware programs, and more.  Having many years of experience in the field of information technology management and security, we decided to kill all the hares and developed Fixico based on IBM and Trend Micro technologies. <br>  Fixico will be useful for home and office users.  Here are some Fixico advantages that we are proud of:

    <img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/897/1ce/01a/8971ce01ad864e2caf88b7eaf70804a1.png"><br><br>  <b>Easy to use</b> <br>  To get started, go to the fixico.com website, register and download the client software.  Fixico will do the rest.  The user remains to control the processes and monitor what is happening with the help of the administrator panel. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c3/715/39b/5c371539b503460c8f12afd4598393d7.png"><br><br>  <b>Automatic problem solving</b> <br>  Fixico works on the principle of minimal user anxiety and automatically removes viruses, malware and spyware.  He also independently updates programs and patches, monitors and fixes problems.  The user only needs to run the necessary processes, and then magic happens. <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff4/d3a/187/ff4d3a1870d54385999cfe48227518c3.png"><br><br>  <b>Cloud technologies</b> <br>  You can remotely manage connected devices using an administrator account, monitor processes, and assist in changing settings wherever you are.  For this you need only an internet connection.  Yes, all this is really so simple. <br><br>  We decided that using Fixico, computers and devices would work faster and safer and put together a lot of incredibly useful tools.  We will tell you more about them: <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ad/e5e/a55/4ade5ea559b74eaabf9a2569747b7e38.png"><br><br>  <b>Performance optimization</b> <br>  One of the important factors of ‚Äúslowing down‚Äù, crashing and freezing the computer is the trashy and fragmented Windows registry.  In essence, the system registry is a database for storing all information about a computer, operating system settings, and programs.  Over time, it accumulates a kind of "garbage": links to remote programs, invalid file extensions, duplicate links and much more.  Fixico regularly scans devices for similar errors and removes / fixes where necessary.  In addition, Fixico defragments the hard drive, which allows to improve the performance of the computer, to prevent from its possible failures and freezes. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b59/519/717/b595197178e24e08be12f1861ff3517c.png"></div><br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/691/24f/d60/69124fd607164879bfcbb33692ceaef4.png"><br><br>  <b>Removing toolbars</b> <br>  The service easily removes malicious programs that are adware or simply act on your nerves, against which the usual antivirus is powerless.  As a rule, toolbars are installed due to carelessness in the process of installing free software, but removing them is not easy.  Moreover, toolbars not only occupy precious space on the screen of your monitor, but can spy on user behavior. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ac/02c/fea/7ac02cfea7144993b5b96e6eb2735fbf.png"><br><br>  <b>Remote access</b> <br>  By connecting the computers and devices of your family or company to one account, you can help in setting up devices, launch certain updates and patches, and monitor the work done, providing technical support to users as if you are nearby.  No need to install anything - we did everything for you. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/675/e6e/c72/675e6ec7245046bb922e4c52fc30e61a.png"><br><br>  <b>24/7 work and updates</b> <br>  Even when you are not at your computer, sleeping or watching TV, Fixico does all the work for you.  Unnoticed and automatically.  You can no longer install the latest updates of programs and antiviruses yourself, since this update will occur automatically.  Moreover, we monitor the ‚Äúhealth‚Äù of the hard disk and can talk about the ‚Äúdisease‚Äù at a very early stage. <br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d6d/120/a6a/d6d120a6a0504d1eaca543fb8b6a1178.png"><br><br>  <b>Antivirus and protection</b> <br>  Instead of installing separate numerous and expensive programs, with Fixico you get a package for diagnosing and combating malware and spyware, viruses, trojans.  We created a service based on IBM and Trend Micro technologies to provide simple and effective anti-virus protection. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/43d/082/a11/43d082a110bf4b38a8188d41c14146c9.png"></div><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/635/c94/2c9/635c942c99b5400c92653fa8d921c889.png"><br><br>  <b>Adult Content Filtering</b> <br>  And one more useful trick: Fixico allows you to restrict children's access to adult and unwanted content.  We offer several levels of protection - from adult content to questionable sites.  In addition, by connecting your account phone to the Fixico admin panel, you will always be aware of where your child is. <br><br><br>  These are just a few of the Fixico features - we are constantly adding new ones to keep up with the times.  By the way, despite the maximum automation of processes, it is the user who fully controls the operation of the service. <br><br>  <b>What for?</b> <br>  We have developed three packages: free, basic and premium, and also offer users a free trial version of the program in order to be able to evaluate all the benefits of the service.  Premium package provides antivirus and automatic maintenance of computers, including software updates, operating systems and security patches. <br>  The free package includes monitoring and analysis, cleaning the registry, deleting unnecessary files and disk defragmentation. <br>  The price varies from 0 to 5 dollars per month, depending on the package chosen and the type of payment: monthly or annual.  In any case, even the maximum annual price of Fixico is significantly lower than the price of a decent antivirus. <br><br>  <b>Update</b> <br>  We constantly update the database of viruses, spyware and malware, potentially unwanted programs and toolbars, because the success of automatic treatment directly depends on the quality of diagnosis.  In addition, we carefully monitor the updates of programs and systems that appear and offer our users only working versions. <br><br>  <b>What is ahead?</b> <br>  Every day we are working to improve the existing service: whether it is adding new features, optimizing the interaction scenario, changing the code or improving the design.  We want the service to be simple and easy to use and as efficient as possible.  In the near future, we are preparing a Fixico client for mobile devices, as well as a version for more advanced users. <br><br>  And here is the promised surprise for the readers.  We give the code for a month of free use of the program.  To use it, follow the link: <a href="https://www.fixico.com/%3Fcode%3DDJ3EU">https://www.fixico.com/?code=DJ3EU</a> <br><br>  We will keep you up to date and share the news.  Stay tuned! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291716/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291716/</a></p>
