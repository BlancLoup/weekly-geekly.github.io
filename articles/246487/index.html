  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Peace, friendship and chewing on the digital services market</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Just over a year ago, I talked about the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/kelnik/blog/205376/">St. Petersburg Association of Digital Companies</a> .  Since then, much water has flowed, it already includes 130 "living" participating companies, of which 26 are "activists" (those who organize events, make reports, modify the site and participate in promotional activities). <br><br>  This year there have been two important events. <br><br><ul><li>  Several Russian cities (Nizhny Novgorod, Ufa, Voronezh) are making similar attempts. </li><li>  RAEC (Russian Association of Electronic Communications) has opened a direction that combines the efforts of web studios, agencies, mobile developers and similar companies - both at the federal level and in specific regions ( <a href="http://raec.ru/commission/clusters/digital/">cluster "RAEC / Digital"</a> ). </li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c77/187/a5d/c77187a5d9e24980a9a7cea718f6ab1a.png"></div><br>  On Habr√© and Hiktaims there are no hubs on the subject of business studios and agencies, so I will try to explain how this interaction is useful for professionals (managers, developers, designers, layout designers), artel freelancers and budding businessmen in our market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We'll have to repeat the phrase from the beginning of the old article: there are only two answers to the question ‚Äúwhy are associations?‚Äù, And they are not mutually exclusive: <br><ul><li>  just to hang out </li><li>  together to solve problems that are not solved individually. </li></ul><br>  About ‚Äúsolving problems‚Äù is more for studios and agencies, including small ones.  This is additional PR, the growth of employees' skills and abilities, the attraction of employees to your city or their retention (for example, labor migration to St. Petersburg in our market has noticeably increased).

      This is what ordinary employees of ordinary companies who are members of <i>good</i> associations get. <br><ul><li>  Workshops from professionals who previously did not even think to bring. </li><li>  Exchange of experience with colleagues at workshops, plus a score to professional growth. </li><li>  Development of own skills of performances and pumping personal brand. </li><li>  The opportunity to go to major events (such as RIF + CIB and RIW) or watch the broadcast and recording in the office. </li><li>  The best view of the market: which company is what it is, where else it is reasonable to go, except for the <i>regional company number one</i> . </li></ul><br>  It turns out that the most important thing in a <i>good</i> association for professionals is live personal communication with colleagues + an open and fast exchange of information and experience. <br><br>  RAEC and Ruward decided to build such a structure already at the All-Russian level.  So far, the structure is called ‚ÄúCluster" RAEC / Digital "(agent services in the market of interactive communications)", or, in a colloquial manner, "digital-cluster RAEC".  Claims to the name are accepted only along with the name option - we honestly thought about what to call the end customers: in one clear word: <br><ul><li>  full service agencies, </li><li>  media agencies </li><li>  creative agencies, </li><li>  web studios, including production and support sites, </li><li>  mobile developers </li><li>  search engine optimizers, </li><li>  contextual advertising agencies </li><li>  mobile marketers, </li><li>  PR and SMM agencies. </li></ul>  They invented how they invented, but it's not the name, is it? <br><br>  The point is.  In fact, we help two different segments of companies from the list above. <br><br><ol><li>  We help companies that have outgrown their region with activity at the All-Russian level (the so-called ‚Äúfederal cluster‚Äù). </li><li>  For companies that still have enough of their own region, we are helping to strengthen our position in our region (the so-called ‚Äúregional clusters‚Äù in cities or regions of the Russian Federation). </li></ol><br>  It is clear that the company can easily move from one category to another, if it changes tactical goals, this is absolutely normal. <br><br>  The cluster is now only being formed, for companies, blocks of activities are prescribed, including both advertising and public relations, as well as training and exchange of experience, and even promising areas: a platform for finding partners, developing standards and others. <br><br>  For example, you can invite a <a href="http://digital-raid.ru/">Digital-raid</a> (a one-day conference on agency management, sales and development). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8e7/ef6/3c8/8e7ef63c82904131896c0855a79b36f5.jpg"><br>  <i>Digital-raid in Voronezh, August 2014</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7ce/c4c/d42/7cec4cd42ab04336b7cf0bd9874a4cd1.JPG"><br>  <i>Digital-raid in Kazan, November 2014</i> <br><br>  Get into the program or even organize a section at a major industry event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/53d/357/a7c/53d357a7c14d4274b42306bf6e9288b0.jpg"><br>  <i>i-Media, a member of the federal cluster, earns customers at the stand, RIF + KIB 2014</i> <br><br>  To get help in organizing small regional events: to bring a respected professional with a master class, to organize an internal mini-seminar on layout or webinar on marketing - depends only on the interests of local market players and their employees. <br><br>  You can already talk about activity in Rostov-on-Don, Ufa, Tomsk.  We hope that in the coming 2015, thanks to the leadership of the companies and in spite of the economic situation, the employees of regional companies will be able not only to work properly, but also to work out professionally without going anywhere. <br><br>  Our undertaking will help freelancers and groups of freelancers only indirectly - if you have activity in the region of profile companies that will organize more events, warm up customers and teach them to part <i>with the latest savings</i> in favor of online promotion. <br><br><blockquote>  More information about the RAEC / Digital cluster can be found on the <a href="http://raec.ru/commission/clusters/digital/">page of the association's website</a> and in the <a href="http://raec.ru/upload/files/digital-cluster-for-dummies.pdf">‚ÄúJust about the RAEC / Digital cluster‚Äù</a> PDF document. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246487/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246487/</a></p>
