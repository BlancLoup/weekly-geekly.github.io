At all.  Even despite the fact that a significant part of our users are connected for free. <br>  We launched the video surveillance service almost a year ago and it was free without any restrictions for everyone.  Three months ago we launched commercial rates and imposed restrictions.  Two cameras are free of charge, including the possibility of broadcasting them on your own site, and additional cameras for a small monthly fee.  Most non-corporate users of the two cameras are more than enough. <br><br>  But most importantly, we left the service free for almost 100,000 accounts that were registered before entering the tariffs, regardless of the number of connected cameras.  We did not want to lose our customers because of the desire to earn more.

      Still, we have no advertising.  Because we do not want our service to be associated with pads, chewing gum or laundry detergent.  Even now, when we are negotiating to attract a new round of investment, one of the conditions of entry, we put the lack of advertising in the video stream.  At least so clumsy and senseless, which is used today popular video hosting.  Our financial model already looks quite attractive without this component of income. <br><br>  But it's not about that.  Since the appearance of our blog and our first <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ivideon/blog/143875/ObpI8yMBA">article</a> on Habr√© about how Ivideon was created, we have never talked about what we did and why?  The fact that companies usually firstly publish on Habr√© in the form of their own advertising, we missed.  Let us do it now and not get too many cons.  Moreover, we just want to talk about our product, which allows us not only to <a href="http://hi-testing.ru/online/incubator/">watch eggs</a> in <a href="http://hi-testing.ru/online/incubator/">real time</a> . <br>  If it is simple, then Ivideon gives a convenient opportunity to combine an unlimited number of cameras scattered geographically in one personal account interface.  They can be located in the same office or on different continents. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Viewing live video from cameras as well as archived recordings is possible on a computer via a browser or using the Ivideon Client application, on mobile devices using applications for iPad, iPhone, Android. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e4f/51f/a80/e4f51fa80f158f10c42d7ea19697d3c1.jpg"><br><br>  Today Ivideon is already a rather serious international project.  And while none of our competitors have the opportunity to provide such a service around the world due to the lack of a scaling mechanism, which was laid by us initially in the development of software for the organization of the service. <br><br><h4>  What features does Ivideon provide as a service? </h4><br><br><ul><li>  Transparent and easy connection of cameras with the ability to view via the Internet.  No external IP address is required. </li><li>  Full encryption of traffic over HTTPS / SSL, including video. </li><li>  Convenient viewing via browser, PC application or using mobile apps for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/ivideon/id464234175%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.ivideon.client">Android</a> . </li><li>  Save archived video in AVI format from any camera without going to the camera installation site. </li><li>  Video archive recording service in our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ivideon/blog/147894/">cloud</a> .  If something happens on the site, your notes will not go anywhere. </li><li>  Want to embed video from your camera in your blog or on your website?  Do it in <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/kak-vstroit-zhivoe-video-v-vash-blog-ili-sajt/">3 clicks</a> .  The rest of the work will be done by our CDN.  The service is available even at a free rate. </li><li>  There is no site, but you want to share video from your camera with friends?  Post to social network?  <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/rasshiryaem-vozmozhnosti-sistemyi-delites-video/">No problem</a> . </li><li>  Need to be notified that your video server has disconnected?  Or is the camera turned off?  There is such a function. </li><li>  Build a corporate network of cameras with access rights differentiation between different people?  The function of transferring rights to view video and archive to other personal accounts is also implemented. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  What for? </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/87f/bf5/f63/87fbf5f639d8823f2da580c7f9c72f33.png"><br>  Yes, Ivideon can be used as a security system.  But to a greater degree it is a convenient tool that allows parents to look after their children, and business owners at their work.  Especially if the business is networked.  You can opt out of secret buyers and regular business trips.  Simply open the browser or download Ivideon to your iPad and see everything without getting up from the chair.  In this case, Ivideon is an independent feedback. <br><br>  Not everyone knows, but many network points on the fast food offer turned for sellers into an opportunity to earn money by selling their own food.  On a scale of 100 points, this is at least 10 million rubles a month in losses.  But even this is not important.  Lost business reputation.  If the client receives poor-quality food, then he will have a negative attitude not to the employee, but to the entire network. <br>  Many banks have no idea how their branches operate in the field.  Somewhere in the head office, business processes are developed in theory and implemented.  But those who invented them may not know that, in reality, due to errors in the calculations, this leads to huge queues and negative customer attitudes.  We give the opportunity to see the work in action. <br><br>  Experienced consultants who yesterday held courses for new sales managers can remotely check how they work in the field and help with advice, having disassembled how to communicate with a client as a lesson. <br>  And there are a lot of such examples. <br><br><h4>  How to connect cameras </h4><br>  To connect cameras to the Ivideon cloud, you do not need an external IP address, knowledge of network settings or expensive equipment.  We tried to make everything as simple and affordable as possible. <br><br>  There are two options for connecting cameras to our service. <br><br>  <b>First option.</b>  <b>Ordinary webcams, IP cameras or analog cameras.</b>  A free <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/programma-videonabljudenija/">Ivideon Server</a> application is installed on a computer running Windows, Linux or Mac OS X, and cameras are connected to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2b9/335/d79/2b9335d794cd00705040768da112c071.png"><br><br>  It has all the basic features of the modern IP video surveillance system and supports virtually all IP cameras (including those with sound) using the RTSP and HTTP protocol, PTZ cameras (a number of models), and allows you to record on the disk locally by motion detection, scheduled or constantly.  When recording by motion detector, a prerecord mechanism is supported, when you see not only the fact of an event, but also what happened a few seconds before it. <br>  All these functions can be used for free even without connecting to Ivideon and without limiting the number of video channels, as is done in other surveillance systems. <br>  But, the main advantage of using Ivideon Server is the ability to connect to our cloud. <br>  To connect analog cameras to Ivideon Server, they need to be digitized.  This can be done using any IP server or DVR that supports RTSP. <br><br>  <b>The second connection option is IP cameras with Ivideon support right on board.</b>  These are completely ordinary IP cameras from well-known manufacturers who supported the work with our service directly in the firmware of the camera itself as an add-on.  It is noteworthy that one of these manufacturers <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ivideon/blog/151903/">was Axis</a> , which was the first in the world to produce such a device as an IP camera and today is the market leader in IP video surveillance.  In addition, the Korean company Microdigital, the Russian brand Sarmatt and Taiwanese 3S work with us. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1be/d1f/410/1bed1f410b592bce32ea978dbda388df.png"><br><br>  We are actively expanding the line of such cameras and plan that soon most manufacturers will support Ivideon.  And by the end of the year, integration with 4 more brands will be completed. <br><br>  To connect the camera with the service Ivideon does not need a computer.  It independently establishes a connection with our cloud (although I prefer the name data center), depending on the geographic location. <br><br>  Some of the cameras support the ability to record an archive on a flash card, and some allow you to connect a Yota or 3G modem and monitor where the wired Internet is not available. <br><br>  We do not seek to earn money on the sale of equipment.  Therefore, all our developments, including ready-to-use firmware, as well as detailed instructions for installing them are presented on our website.  This is primarily necessary for those who, for one reason or another, have already become the owner of cameras supported by us, but without our service on board.  Nevertheless, for those who prefer to buy cameras that are already ready for use and tested by our specialists, we have opened our small <a href="http://www.ivideon.ru/shop/">online store</a> .  All prices listed on the cameras are on the same level as in other companies, and somewhere even lower. <br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  As I said at the very beginning, this post is a story about our service.  It can even be counted as an advertisement, but I hope that thanks to it you have learned for yourself about the new opportunities that Ivideon can give you. <br>  If you have any questions, I will be happy to answer them in the comments.  And in the following articles, with the interest of our readers, I will try to tell about our architecture. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> If you want to put a minus, do not do it.  Better see how beautiful this <a href="http://www.ivideon.com/tv/v1/%3Fserver%3D3ec6f2d9f1f9fb65658a5c6d9de5f493%26camera%3D131072%26lang%3Dru">world is</a> .  And what he can <a href="http://www.ivideon.com/tv/v1%3Fserver%3Dab1de1c1a84b8c99bbf5604830ed5644%26camera%3D65536">turn into</a> if we are not patient with each other.  Right now you have a chance to be kind and understanding, do not waste it. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153301/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153301/</a></p>
