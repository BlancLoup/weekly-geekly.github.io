This experiment allowed us to increase the average bill by 60%. <br><br>  A bit of history: <br>  Let's break away from IT for the sake of IT and talk about what IT actually lives in the micro business (according to <a href="http://www.rg.ru/2008/08/05/biznes-kriterii.html">a government decree</a> , companies with a turnover of less than 60 million rubles per year belong to the micro business!), Namely, Internet marketing. <br>  To be clear, the average check is an amount equal to the share of revenue per customer. <br>  Example.  For the month, the turnover of your company is 240.000 rubles, and this month there were 44 sales. <br>  The average check will be equal to 240.000 / 44 = 5.455 rubles. <br><br>  Marketers are struggling to increase a few things: the number of customers, the average bill (the quantity and quality of purchases), the frequency of purchases.  To do this, they periodically generate new ideas and peep from competitors, and then go to the all-powerful IT people and ask them to implement their brilliant ideas.  IT-specialists usually twist at the temple first, and then offer several options, and as a result give the ready-made candy to the suffering marketers. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Essentially: all brilliant ideas need to be tested and evaluated results.  There are radically different results in different niches.  So look, think, adapt, embed. <br><br>  I am sure you will be able to adopt our results and apply them in your niche. <br><br><h4>  Let's start. </h4><br>  Initially, the task was to raise the average check.  For this, it was suggested that after ordering a single product (relatively cheap (100 rubles)), before directly paying, to offer a relevant second product (more expensive than the first (1000 rubles)).  Dear cross-sell. <br><br>  It looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/293/229/77c/29322977c83cb42a135ee846bae06749.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de7/776/0d7/de77760d73909ed5d238c6cba76d10bc.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/754/f2f/206/754f2f20677006f3dbced4f867cfaa4f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f2/9c8/ee4/6f29c8ee43f3dcd07c6dad82b7005bcc.jpg"><br><br>  Step 1. The customer studies the first product description page. <br>  Step 2. The customer places an order.  (Enters your contact details) <br>  Step 3. The client is invited to add a second expensive item to the payment. <br>  Step 4. The customer pays for the order online, or selects payment upon delivery. <br><br>  In step 3, the customer either adds to the payment the product offered to him, or proceeds to payment without adding. <br>  In step 4, the customer is billed for the total amount. <br>  The test consisted in the fact that half of the visitors were offered a second product, and half were not. <br>  That is, in fact, there was a split testing of ‚Äústep 3‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Why tested? </h4><br>  We wanted to find out: does it greatly reduce the extra step (‚Äústep 3‚Äù) in the way of ordering the number of payments and how many customers will add and pay for the second more expensive product.  After all, an extra step, an extra click, an extra client movement very often reduces the number of these same clients.  Therefore, without thinking about inserting extra steps in the way of registration and payment of the order is a big loss for any company. <br><br>  Example.  Each new field in the form of subscription to the newsletter reduces the conversion of this form in 2 times. <br><br>  During the experiment, the conversion figures for orders and payments fluctuated in different directions, but the statistical probability of winning any of the options was not achieved.  This means that the number of payments with ‚Äústep 3‚Äù and without ‚Äústep 3‚Äù was approximately the same. <br><br>  As a result, the number of unique visitors who were not offered additional goods was 1022, of which 214 were ordered, and in the end paid for 85. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e13/371/1b3/e133711b36693042c4d2c19de462b374.jpg"><br><br>  The number of visitors who were offered an additional expensive product, was 1051, of them ordered 223, and paid for 84. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f55/26f/34a/f5526f34ab8f29709530c6b8173e8b31.jpg"><br><br>  The number of payments containing an additional product 5. (5/84 = 5.95% approximately 6%) <br><br>  What is it about money?  Taking into account the cost of the first product = 100 rubles, and additional goods = 1.000 rubles. <br><br>  In the first case - it is 85 * 100 = 8.500 rubles. <br>  In the second case, this is 84 * 100 + 5 * 1.000 = 8.400 + 5.000 = 13.400 rubles. <br><br>  Thus, due to the additional offer of the relevant product, we have increased the average bill by 60%. <br><br>  Moreover, it is interesting that the <b>presence of an extra step</b> (‚Äústep 3‚Äù) <b>did NOT reduce the number of payments</b> . <br><br>  The traffic to the page with the first product came from the E-mail distribution of our <a href="http://www.sheremetev.info/">online store</a> . <br>  The split-testing tool used internal development, the program <a href="http://www.launchpro.ru/ac2/">Avtokontakt</a> . <br><br>  What we implement according to the results of testing: <br><br>  We add ‚Äústep 3‚Äù to all products with the offer of a relevant, more expensive additional product. <br><br>  PS This article describes the most recent experiment.  This is not the first experiment to test the performance of cross-sell.  All previous tests also confirmed an increase in the average bill. <br><br>  All the benefits and increase the average check. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/207228/">https://habr.com/ru/post/207228/</a></p>
