  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Effective work in Mac OS X</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Mac OS X is a very beautiful axis with a lot of utilities, and to the disgrace it is easy to manage and use even with default settings and settings - that‚Äôs a fact.  But I am interested in efficiency and, if I may say so, open spaces in the use of the entire OS.  This prompted me to write this post and explain in detail what I‚Äôm doing to enhance CE * when working on my 12 ‚ÄúiBook iBook.  Also this post and my skills can be useful to the switchers who have just bought their first mac.  So, from the word to the case. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Clean desktop </h3><br>  I hate a crap desktop.  Excess icons, files and folders on the desktop - in FIG!  all icons and files, folders - everything in FIG from the desktop.  I leave only the most necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãan icon on a hard disk, maybe one or two smart-daddies, some kind of file.  No more.  The icons of disk drives, usb flash drives, digital cameras, etc. appear / disconnect themselves when connected, so I don‚Äôt even think about them.  Downloaded files are immediately sent to the Downloads folder.  <strong>The desktop should always be clean</strong> .

    <h3>  Dock Icons </h3><br>  If you think that they are for convenient and quick launch of programs, then you are mistaken.  Do not think that I am a fan of "delete", but ... In my Mac OS X, there is not a single icon in the dock.  I generally only have 3 of them: finder, dashboard &amp; trash.  Have you already noticed that when you start a program, does it appear in the dock?  So, the dock is needed to fill it with running programs. <br><br><img src="http://www.slaff.net/uploads/macosx_dock.jpg" alt="mac os x dock"><br><br>  It is important to install the dock where you feel most comfortable.  For me, the most convenient way is to keep it from the bottom in the center, while the dock itself does not take up very much space, I reduced it in System Preferences. <br><br><h3>  Why is it important to immediately put the dock right? </h3><br>  How a person uses a computer is generally a whole philosophy.  Purely psychologically, any user is designed so that, often, working daily with a computer, he runs a certain set of programs in a certain sequence.  This is such a delicate moment that you hardly notice it when you work with a computer every day. <br><br>  Actually for this very reason, putting the dock in a convenient place, you automatically get used to move the mouse cursor for a particular action with a certain program (close, restore the window, open properties, etc) in a certain place on the screen. <br><br>  And for the same reason, a wonderful program was invented, which I am talking about in the next block. <br><br><h3>  Quicksilver is our all </h3><br>  At first glance, <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/"><strong>Quicksilver</strong></a> may seem terrifying and very uncomfortable.  It would seem, why memorize the names of programs, if you can put icons in the dock?  And why change Spotlight to QS?  Quicksilver is a mega cool featured program launcher, a search engine for your Mac, and take a word, it makes life a lot easier. <br><br>  As I said earlier, usually each user uses certain programs in his daily life.  For example, I immediately turn on Safari, Adium, Skype, Mail, Textmate, well, sometimes I need to work in Lightroom, iGTD or play a couple of favorite toys.  Very few of my usual names, is not it? <br><br>  Quicksilver is very easy to use - it is called by a hot key, which is configured to your discretion.  A standard program view will appear: <br><br><img src="http://www.slaff.net/uploads/macosx_quicksilver.jpg" alt="mac os x quicksilver"><br><br>  In the upper part we drive in a keyword, and in the lower part, as the word is typed, a brief description and a possible action will appear, and from the top you will see the location on the hard disk under the program / file name.  In addition, on the right there will be a drop-down list with all the results.  When you press the Return button, it will launch what you stopped when typing keywords. <br><br>  In QS, it is not at all necessary to type the full name of the program, it‚Äôs up to you to type what you need.  And this is only a small part of what Quicksilver can do.  By and large, it deserves special attention and a very large overview of opportunities.  You can write entire chains of actions, open a link on the key URL in your favorite browser, you can configure different triggers, there are a <a href="http://quicksilver.blacktree.com/plugins.php">lot of plugins</a> . <br><br><h3>  What's next </h3><br>  You can also add <a href="http://www.donelleschi.com/stickywindows/"><strong>Sticky Windows</strong></a> .  If you have an iBook, then a 12 ‚Äùscreen is sometimes too small.  Anyway, cluttering up the desktop with a bunch of open windows of different programs is ugly :).  Sticky Windows solves this problem.  See the <a href="http://www.donelleschi.com/stickywindows/">demo screencast</a> offsite. <br><br>  Another important point.  Mac OS X thinks for you where it is needed.  Therefore, buying a Mac, get used immediately to the simplicity and order.  :) <br><br>  * CE - efficiency ratio <br>  The original of this post can always be <a href="http://www.slaff.net/2007/05/08/effektivnaya-rabota-v-mac-os-x.html">read in my blog</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/8134/">https://habr.com/ru/post/8134/</a></p>
