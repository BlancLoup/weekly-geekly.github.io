  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Manual installation of the ADB driver</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share with you a simple way to install the ADB driver under Windows.  This article will be needed for those who do not install this driver at all, or install it, but adb still doesn‚Äôt see the device (it was mine), or you didn‚Äôt find this driver.  So all those who have / had similar problems, or who are just interested, please under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'll start with the background.  I decided to buy an inexpensive tablet on Android for reading books (DJVU / PDF), and the choice fell on a <s>Russian-made</s> device of course Chinese-made <a href="http://www.texet.ru/catalog/id115/">TeXet TM-7025</a> .  Toad pressed to buy something expensive, but for a simple reading of books, some super-characteristics are not required.  Later, I discovered that most of the toys are good for him, it is convenient to climb in the internet while you are sitting <s>in da kabin</s> , etc. And since I was learning about Android before me, I decided that it would be very convenient to use an iron device for this instead of anguish with emulators . <br><br>  And here I was waited by an unpleasant surprise - whether the native driver turned out to be crooked, or Windows, or the wire ... in general, the driver then got up, the Windows device manager reported on the device‚Äôs full functionality, but I received an empty list on the <b>adb devices</b> request and Naturally, the test application on the tablet failed. <br><br>  I wrote a request to the TeXeT support service, they even answered me with a link to the driver itself, which, as I have already seen, did not work.  I started looking for an answer on the Internet and found a bunch of different assemblies of this driver and manuals, but still none of them started up as it should, and even the native driver from the SDK didn‚Äôt get anyway at all, which discouraged me ... but not despair.

      It was here that I decided to try my hand at <s>writing drivers</s> using the good old method of scientific typing and opened the driver inf-file.  The hope was given to me by the understanding that the software part of the adb interface on the tablet side should be identical for all devices, and the USB worked anyway.  And so, after several unsuccessful samples of manual editing of the inf-file, I found a recipe for <s>treating the</s> seasoning of the inf-file so that it was set up and, most importantly, worked. <br><br>  So let's get started. <br><br>  <u>Step 1. Download the driver.</u>  If you haven‚Äôt already done this, open the Android SDK Manager, find the Extras section, tick off the Google USB Driver and click Install Packages.  It's simple.  Wait until it loads. <br><br>  <u>Step 2. Find the driver and make a copy of it in a separate folder.</u>  Go to the% android-sdk% \ extras \ google \ folder and you will see the cherished usb_driver daddy there.  Copy it somewhere, and in the same place we will carry out further manipulations.  In principle, you can edit the "original", but I preferred to keep the original intact for every fireman. <br><br>  <u>Step 3. Edit the inf-file.</u>  In the daddy, open the android_winusb.inf file and look for lines like this: <br><pre><code class="bash hljs">;Google Nexus One %SingleAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_18D1&amp;PID_0D02 %CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_18D1&amp;PID_0D02&amp;MI_01 %SingleAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_18D1&amp;PID_4E11 %CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_18D1&amp;PID_4E12&amp;MI_01</code> </pre> <br>  We make a copy of these lines, replace <b>Google Nexus One</b> with <b>% your_device_device_name%</b> for identification in the future and ... open the Windows Device Manager.  We are looking for our device there ( <b>Android</b> , <b>Android Composite ADB Interface</b> or something in this style).  Open the properties of the device, the tab ‚ÄúDetails‚Äù, select the item ‚ÄúEquipment ID‚Äù in the list and see the following picture. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e71/b99/481/e71b994817b6b1a506c792561690fbc8.png"><br>  Copy the line that is most similar to the one shown in the figure (It is, in theory, just a little shorter), and paste it into our inf-file. <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">;TEXET TM-7025 %SingleAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_18D1&amp;PID_0003 %CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_18D1&amp;PID_0003&amp;MI_01 %SingleAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_18D1&amp;PID_0003 %CompositeAdbInterface% = USB_Install, USB\VID_18D1&amp;PID_0003&amp;MI_01</code> </pre><br>  In% SingleAdbInterface% we delete the end of the line, as we see, in% CompositeAdbInterface% we insert the whole.  It‚Äôs probably not necessary to repeat everything twice, but I‚Äôm already worth it and I‚Äôm too lazy to experiment :) <br>  We remain (be careful - in some cases, for this you need to run a notepad with administrator rights, since in the user mode you will not be allowed to overwrite the inf-file). <br>  <u>Step 4. Install the driver.</u>  Now that everything is ready, we return to the device manager and remove all previously installed adb drivers (if any).  We update the list of devices and see our device without drivers.  Open its properties and select "update drivers", select the installation from the folder, specify the folder with the corrected inf-ohm and start the installation - our driver is instantly located, but during the installation it can swear about incompatibility with the question "Do you want to continue nayannek?".  We continue.  Everything, the driver is installed. <br>  <u>Step 5. Final.</u>  For accuracy, we take out the USB port, wait until everything is detected, open the console (Win + R, enter <b>cmd</b> ) and write <b>adb devices</b> .  If everything went well - we see the cherished list item, indicating that adb now sees our device. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78e/337/9e3/78e3379e368156687a636149688447a3.png"><br>  From this point on, you can safely run eclipse and build programs, enjoying the convenient automatic build, installation and debugging right on our device. <br><br>  <b>If the adb command doesn't work for you at all.</b>  Computer -&gt; Properties -&gt; Environment Variables.  We are looking for the Path variable and at the end we <u>write</u> (in no case do not overwrite) the semicolon at the end, and then the address of the folder where adb lives (usually% android-sdk% \ platform-tools \).  After a reboot, it should work. <br>  Sometimes adb does not start automatically at system startup.  Run manually. <br><br>  <b>What was it?</b> <br>  In fact, everything is simple.  For some reason (Windows Mastday / Prog Hand Curves / Google Inf file was written only for native Google devices / Your computer was spoiled by Higgs bosons) Windows does not want to eat Google driver for non-Google devices that are not recorded in the inf file.  Apparently, everything there is just tied to these ID-equipment.  But after all, the software part on the vast majority of Android devices in the debugger connector to the PC is identical, because the driver must communicate normally with any Android device.  Our task is to trick Windows and force it to take the device as ‚Äúdriver-suitable‚Äù, which we did by writing its ID in the driver's inf-file. <br><br>  I hope that this manual will help someone to get their Chinese or other device, for which they forgot to make a normal adb driver when building the system, or those who are asked to download the official driver from the device manufacturer (this happens so much that it‚Äôs faster I was so with the driver for the phone LG E510). <br><br>  PS I did not conduct mass testing of this method, so I can not guarantee that it will work 100% in all cases.  But he earned it from me on Windows 7, and after that on Windows 8. The file had to be edited separately for each time, but I do not think that this is such a problem. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157721/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157721/</a></p>
