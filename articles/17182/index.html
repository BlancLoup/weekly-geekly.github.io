  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tsiolkovsky and Social Networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Taken from the book "The Cause of the Cosmos."  I think someone will be interesting. <br><blockquote>  You are composed of atoms.  Therefore, endless, subjectively continuous satisfaction applies to you.  If cosmos is perfect, then you also <br>  because you are part of it.  In general, you live his life. <br><br>  <strong>MP</strong> ... But I am not an atom, but a collection of atoms.  Death will dissipate them, and I will not. <br><br>  <strong>The answer is</strong> .  No, you are an atom, and its sensation depends on the activity of the brain ganglia.  Your body is a collection of an enormous number of atoms, each of which senses according to the part of the organism into which it enters.  For example, in the nails and bones, atoms live like in plants, in the spinal cord they feel like insects, in the brain, like humans, etc. The animal is like a well, perfectly organized society.  Each member of his lives almost exclusively the life of the association, forgetting himself and his passions.  Society collapsed (i.e., the organism died), and all members lost the highest feelings of a strong social life.  But they did not die;  they can join again <br>  in the composition of new societies: one into one (i.e. into one animal), another into another (for example, from Russian will become a German subject), etc. <br>  That this is true is evident from the following.  Before your conception, your atoms were scattered and were in water, air, soil, on the air, on other planets, in the sun, etc. But this did not prevent them from accepting the life that is now playing in you.  After your destruction, or death, they again wander around the universe.  This was before your conception and did not prevent you from getting a life.  Consequently, after death, your position will be no worse than the one that was before your worthless life.  It is clear that the latter will arise again and will always arise, after each destruction, as after the disintegration of a highly organized society, its members (people or other creatures) can heal again the highest <br>  social life, to join citizens in other surviving associations.

      <strong>NN</strong> ... In your opinion, it turns out that I am not alone in my body, but we are many.  I just can not understand this. <br><br>  <strong>The answer is</strong> .  In an ideal society, all members in their activities follow the same, united will, one.  the idea ‚Äî and this is why such a society is like a single being.  Also in the body is the illusion of a single being.  There are many of them, both in society and in animals, but the brain atoms (or members of society) are imbued with a single spirit, a single sensation. <br><br>  <strong>NN</strong> ... But the atom (approximately) every 4 months leaves the body, and I stay.  So the sensation is not connected with the atom, but with something else, only with the game of the brain. <br><br>  <strong>The answer is</strong> .  That's right: members (i.e., atoms&gt; of an organism, like members of society, go and come <br>  several times during their lifetime.  But if an atom leaves the body, then does it change because of it?  Can the body notice or notify somebody about the departure of some atoms and their replacement with others?  This is one of human or animal illusions. <br>  In society, some members die, while others are born, but does it have an impact on the general appearance of the state.  It can live for millennia and more. <br>  Society is alive and, when communicating with others, does not even announce the death of its members, so it is usually so insignificant.  Each member of the association studies its history, is imbued with it, and it already seems to him that he lived from the very beginning of society ‚Äî thousands of years ago.  Also, the atom, entering the organism from the outside, is now absorbed by the whole set of its ideas, up to the memories of its infancy, and it already seems to him that it lives in the body from its conception, although this was not at all.  This is the same illusion of human memory.  Everyone says: since I remember my own <br>  life means I have lived in my body since its inception, while the substance has resumed many times throughout life.  From this he concludes that there is a spirit independent of matter. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17182/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17182/</a></p>
