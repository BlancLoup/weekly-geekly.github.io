Some may swear on his iPhone that he is the only real phone, others curse him with all their hearts.  The end of sentimentality - we will tell you how much apple fruit is good. <br><br>  A lot of glass, a lot of metal and a lot of fresh features - the new Apple iPhone makes you want to take possession of it.  During the tests, we also found some flaws, such as non-expandable memory and obvious problems with signal reception. <br>  In addition to external tuning, Apple also pumped "iron".  There is a new HD-display, improved camera with flash and new features such as video telephony.  The iPhone 4 works under the new operating system iOS 4, first introduced in the iPad.  She added phone multitasking.  In terms of performance, the smartphone does not lag behind competitors, here the beginner is made at a very good level. <br><br>  Already curious?  Then read under the cut, as the iPhone 4 showed itself in the heavy test of CHIP magazine, what are its strengths and weaknesses. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ca/57/ca57565244b904ab389411a30530acb4.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <h3>  Most striking: Design and display </h3><br>  Mobile phone comes in very small packaging.  In the box is a USB cable, headphones and power cable, a small metal pin for opening the SIM card slot and operating instructions.  The iPhone 4 is very comfortable and compact in the hand.  Although it is a bit thinner than its predecessor, we have the impression of a much smaller device.  New materials look very good, glass panels surrounded by a metal frame, give the phone an elegant look.  With dimensions of 115 √ó 57x10 mm and a weight of 142 grams, the phone is not only compact, but also quite heavy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/fd/51/fd515ab14a4b5d9c2c8d42ac011b6fd5.jpg"><br><br>  The on / off switch and volume buttons are made of metal, there is a second microphone next to the headphone jack and a front camera.  Micro-SIM side slot, normal SIM cards no longer fit, as we‚Äôve already seen on the iPad. <br><br>  Apple's processing was a success: nothing shakes or seems odd.  Only one drawback is visible: the glass is very branded.  Each time you press, ugly fingerprints are inevitably left on the phone.  Already after a short time of use, the phone becomes dirty, only one thing helps here - constant cleaning. <br><br><h3>  New standards for TFT displays </h3><br>  Presented by Apple display, under the marketing name "Retina-Display", this is a 3.5-inch screen with an impressive resolution of 960 √ó 640 pixels.  A display with IPS technology should allow a wider viewing angle and have a higher contrast.  We are immediately struck by: in the iPhone 4, individual pixels are almost invisible to the naked eye.  Contrast and black levels the new display shows better than many other phones, but Apple could work on brightness: the maximum brightness level is slightly darker than on the iPhone 3G. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c4/68/c468202da7d1cca01cd7fabfcdabb93b.jpg"><br>  <em>iPhone 3G and iPhone 4</em> <br><br>  Many users report yellow spots on their new phones.  We did not find them on our test specimens.  Stains are formed from not completely hardened glue, as soon as the glue hardens, they should disappear. <br><br>  The phone has a back-lit active TFT display.  Therefore, it consumes more energy than, say, an AMOLED display with glowing cells.  Compared to Samsung Wave, the first phone with a Super-AMOLED screen, the iPhone leaves a slightly worse impression, but overtakes Samsung in resolution (Wave: 800 √ó 480 pixels). <br><br><h3>  Multimedia and sound: full of problems </h3><br>  The camera takes photos with a resolution of 5 megapixels, supports touch focus and LED backlighting.  Test photos can be quite proud.  However, the old problem of iPhones remained here.  In low light conditions, image quality is significantly affected.  And this is despite the fact that Apple claims that the camera will show maximum performance even in low light conditions. <br>  The new iPhone shoots 720p HD video at up to 30 frames per second.  In addition, the phone has a front VGA camera that can take both photos and videos with a maximum resolution of 480 √ó 640 pixels.  As in photo mode, you can switch between the rear and front camera, use touch focus and turn on the backlight.  We liked the video quality: the clips are very clear and have clear sound.  <a href="http://www.chip.de/c1_videos/iPhone-4-So-gut-sehen-HD-Videos-aus-Video_43540923.html" title="Test video">Test video</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f8/e9/f8e9fcc6bea517df1c1804ddc5909106.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/34/37/34374f56eb5fa0502dd6acee453bccce.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/96/45/9645c148404237cb195dda62eb636d28.jpg"><br><br>  Both cameras support the new feature of the FaceTime video call, but there are two limitations: while the iPhone 4 does not support video telephony with phones from other manufacturers and the connection is not via a cellular network, but via WiFi.  The advantage is in saving money, but both you and your interlocutor must have WiFi connected. <br>  In practice, ‚ÄúFaceTime‚Äù works well, contact with contacts is easy, the image and sound quality is in order.  During a conversation, you can switch between the front and rear cameras. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9b/18/9b182b0356c7904e9a7521be61aabca0.jpg"><br><br>  Next to the headphone jack is a second microphone, it serves to reduce the noise.  In our test, the sound during calls was normal, but not better than in other phones.  Just the opposite: when calling on a landline, the voice of the caller from the iPhone 4 sounds muffled and not very natural.  When calling to mobile phones, the sound is better.  Speakerphone has a rather modest quality.  Voices can be heard very muffled, metal and with insufficient volume. <br>  Signal reception problems lie in metal antenna frames.  With minor changes in the position of the phone, the signal reception changed dramatically.  We still have not tested any phones where the signal quality would change so much.  Apple pushes this problem to users: the user is to blame for the problem, he is not holding the phone correctly. <br><br><h3>  Internal values: performance, memory, programs. </h3><br>  With the speed of data transfer, with the new WiFi-n standard, Apple is still a step better in using the Internet.  A powerful processor makes the life of the phone possible outside the network. <br><br>  From 32 GB you can use only 29 GB for your own data.  As before, the possibility of expanding the memory is not provided.  The data transfer rate is also already familiar figures: HSPA with a maximum speed of 7.2 MB / s.  The phone has a new WiFi: iPhone 4 offers 802.11n in the 2.4 GHz band.  This seriously increases the possible speed of the WiFi network.  Until now, only a few phones, such as the Samsung Wave and Galaxy S, support the n-standard. <br><br>  Applications and the camera open quickly, the speed of the web browser is also at the level.  iPhone 4 is based on Apple's new A4 chip.  He must provide the phone not only speed, but also endurance.  So Apple promises 4 hours of talks or 40 hours of continuous listening to music.  During the tests, we were skeptical about the promises about the battery: after all, after half an hour of tests and games, the indicator showed a 22% less charge.  But the battery test showed very good endurance.  About six and a half hours the device has worked at full power GSM.  Although, it is necessary to take into account that in this test the display, which is a potential energy eater, is not active. <br><br><h3>  Management and firmware </h3><br>  Full lamers and experienced users immediately cope with the management.  Regardless of what you want to do: listen to music, watch a video, go to the App Store or change the basic parameters: there are no complicated settings or incomprehensible options on the iPhone.  IPhone 4 works on iOS 4 (A8293).  The new operating system has already been tested by us in another test. <br>  Along with the already well-known features, the iPhone 4 supports, for example, the iBook for reading electronic books, like on the iPad, you can now read books. <br><br><h3>  Result: finally in TOP 10 </h3><br>  Elegant design, modern camera, cool HD display and excellent performance: the iPhone 4 did not disappoint the expectations of users and testers.  Apple made a lot of the right changes.  One thing we can say without a doubt: the iPhone 4 is the best of the iPhone.  Reward: ninth place in the <a href="http://www.chip.de/bestenlisten/Bestenliste-Handys--index/index/id/598/">ranking of mobile phones</a> . <br>  We did not like the quality of the speakerphone, the very poor reception of the network and the marz of the device.  Apple again did not add the possibility of expanding memory using microSD cards, it would make sense if you can record video in HD quality. <br><br><h3>  Alternative </h3><br>  With the high price of the Apple iPhone 4, you will be robbed.  Are you still looking for a smartphone with a touchscreen HD display, a good camera and lots of features?  Then look at the leaders in our <a href="http://www.chip.de/bestenlisten/Bestenliste-Handys--index/index/id/598/">phone rankings</a> . <br>  The Samsung S8500 Wave has a Super-AMOLED display, which even surpassed the iPhone screen.  With WiFi, Bluetooth 3.0 and record battery endurance.  However, the new Bada operating system does not yet provide such a large selection of applications like the Apple App Store.  For a fair price just below 305 euros you get a super-smart phone.  Who wants to have a lot of applications and is ready to invest about 100 euros more, we recommend Android-leader HTC Desire with the same good filling and AMOLED display. <br><br>  Original: <a href="http://www.chip.de/artikel/Apple-iPhone_4_32GB-Test_41317708.html">Chip.de</a> <br>  This was my first experience translating articles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97508/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97508/</a></p>
