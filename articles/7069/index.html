For 14 people living in the country, there is one camera. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/49f/b63/2ef/49fb632ef59d27902a22926ddb653f82.jpg" width="182" height="262" hspace="10" vspace="10" align="right">  The average Londoner comes into their field of view 300 times a day.  20% of the total number of surveillance cameras in the world are located in the United Kingdom.  Does it help? <br>  My friends in Manchester broke into the basement.  Twice.  The first time they stole a bike.  The second time, just in case, they looked to ask if there was anything else left. <br>  In the next block, laptops were stolen from the children living on the ground floor (laptops here are all called laptops, and laptops, in turn, are called writing-books).  Twice, in two different rooms. <br>  A month later, an announcement about the sale of used laptops at relatively ridiculous prices appeared on the doors of the same block.  As further investigation showed this comical situation (the cost of stolen computers is compensated by insurance), there was a lot of police near the house at the address indicated in the ad.  Sales of laptops - was not. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The Manchester Police is conducting a campaign</b> , the purpose of which is to present the "Security Kits" to the citizens. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/52e/353/433/52e353433c71a864dc4bdf86fe2f913c.jpg" width="365" height="274" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Inside, there are instructions on how to protect property, a UV marker, five stickers of all sizes with the words ‚ÄúAttention tracked property‚Äù and ‚ÄúHands off, reliably protected‚Äù, candy and coupons for McDonalds at a discount.  As the last two self-defense tools help in ensuring security, I still do not understand, but everything else works.  You are invited to: <br>  1. Sign all your valuables (iPod, PDA, cellular, TV, grand piano) with an ultraviolet marker, preferably somewhere in the depths.  Write a zip code, house number. <br>  2. Stick on the already signed valuables "thieves deterring holographic security stickers", letting you know that things can be traced. <br>  3. Fill out the enclosed form in which indicate the name of the property, manufacturer, serial number (for example, ‚Äúgrand piano Moscow, serial number 0002, additional information: there are no two black keys‚Äù). <br>  4. Register and fill out a similar online form at <a href="https://www.immobilise.com/">www.immobilise.com</a> . <br>  5. Use things with peace of mind, thinking that if your piano is still stolen without fear of holographic stickers, the valiant British Police, guided by the traces of the ultraviolet marker and the serial numbers left in duplicate in paper form and on the website, it will return to you. <br>  Everything.  Simple and, I think, quite effective.  Sometimes things come back. <br><br>  <b>But if you really care about the safety of your own things</b> , you should do what the author of these lines did: <br>  1. Chain the laptop to the wall with a Kensington lock; <br>  2. Add to the only alarm on the window three more screamers (1 pound, 50 rubles); <br>  3. Organize round-the-clock monitoring of the room using a webcam and <a href="http://www.pysoftware.com/ActiveWebCamMainpage.htm">Active WebCam</a> (thanks for <a href="http://offline.computerra.ru/2005/575/37900/">detailed instructions to</a> Sergey Golubitsky).  At the same time you will receive a photo from the room when you register the movement in it. <br><br>  <b>The kidnappers of GPS receivers</b> , recently especially popular with motorists, are caught like this: they place cars with GPS on the windshield around the city and sit in ambush.  The number of theft of GPS receivers is markedly reduced. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/bbe/025/80b/bbe02580bf5820f747c09b3dcafbd3b5.jpg" width="365" height="255" hspace="10" vspace="10">

      <b>Nightlife in Manchester</b> is stormy.  In the centers of cities in the UK, non-alcoholic zones, and the police use the directive "A fine for violating 500 pounds (25 thousand rubles)" is by no means formal. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/3d3/c75/0e4/3d3c750e4e3cb1dd101f3ce9aef02dc2.jpg" width="365" height="269" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  The result is a complete absence of people with bottles in their hands.  The situation is balanced by a huge number of pubs (in York, a small town - more than 330 pubs, that is, all year round, every day, you can go and see new, not get bored).  But the meadows in front of the pubs, green during the day, at night represent a terrible sight: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b43/c6c/883/b43c6c883348b46ce7e3c774b0e518c5.jpg" width="365" height="274" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Nobody imposed a ban on smoking in the city, but for some reason there are also few smokers on the streets.  Many young people in fitness centers and outdoor areas / stadiums, it is now extremely popular. <br><br>  <b>City in Manchester</b> - the most modern in the UK, rebuilt since 1996.  The reason for this was not quite a joyful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1996_Manchester_bombing">event</a> : <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/oyjjTepH7-w%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgwWgGopm49xDOimEtwCqCpNaIO4Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  There was no stronger explosion in the UK since the Second World War.  The attack, organized by the Irish Republican Army (IRA), caused enormous damage to the economy and infrastructure of Manchester, estimated at ¬£ 411 million.  No one, fortunately, was seriously injured, but in fact there was nothing left of the city center.  So the place where the explosion occurred, looks now: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/2f5/ef7/1b1/2f5ef71b139855114ede4ee7596c3a01.jpg" width="365" height="274" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  Near the Arndale shopping Center, under a pedestrian tunnel through the air across the road, there is an unremarkable <b>classic red English mailbox</b> (visible in the photo above).  A sign is attached to it with the following inscription: ‚ÄúThis mailbox remained almost intact when, on June 15, 1996, the area around it was devastated by a bomb blast.  The box was removed during the re-creation of City and was returned to its original place on November 22, 1999. ‚Äù <br>  I wish we all be like this box.  If suddenly everything is crumbling to pieces, we stand firmly on his feet. <br><br>  <b>Thank you for your attention</b> , finally a riddle again, this time more complicated.  What is the purpose of the strange construction on the left in the photo, so similar to a rocket, just not a rocket?  How can it be used?  Tips: this design is essential for survival in urban environments and will definitely be actively used in the future, the English name of this thing can be reduced to two letters: UO. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/4fb/0b5/8cc/4fb0b58ccb67c12debda471719e11326.jpg" width="426" height="362" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  The first to the previous question was answered by the quick-witted Jabrachelovek <a href="http://juanklumba.habrahabr.ru/">juanklumba</a> , he got a prize, you know what. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7069/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7069/</a></p>
