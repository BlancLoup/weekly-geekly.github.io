    <h1>  What is being taught </h1>  What kind of beast is such a "bachelor"? <br>  Let's <a href="http://www.edu.ru/db/portal/spe/fgos/pr_fgos_2009_pv_122b.pdf">open a</a> new educational standard (for example, specialty 230200 ‚ÄúInformation systems and technologies‚Äù). <br>  Bachelor study for 4 years, of which: <br>  13% Humanitarian, social and economic cycle <br>  27% Mathematical and natural science cycle <br>  1% Physical <br>  3% Practice, NIR <br>  6% Certification, diploma <br>  Actually <b>on subjects in the specialty exactly 50% remains</b> .  The previous standard was 45%. <br>  These 50% still include such subjects as far from computers as metrology and BC. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <font color="#cccccc"><s>If you open the list of Computer Science courses of some European ( <a href="http://www.cscubed.org/syllabus/">Cambridge</a> ) or American ( <a href="http://www.eecs.mit.edu/ug/6-3.html">MIT</a> ) university, you can see that in the decaying West, education is treated more pragmatically.</s></font>  <font color="#cccccc"><s>A cursory overview gives reason to believe that <b>in computer science abroad, all subjects are somehow connected with the specialty.</b></s></font>  <font color="#cccccc"><s>There are no isolated disciplines - if there is economics or mathematics, then it is given in relation to IT.</s></font> <font color="#cccccc"><s><br></s></font>  This turned out to be untrue, thanks <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/maximkat/" class="user_link">MaximKat</a> .  The ratio of core / non-core subjects in the West is approximately the same as ours (although it depends on the university, and we have it strictly written in the educational standard). <br><br>  I will not argue whether the availability of humanitarian subjects is good or bad, or why should a matan, macroeconomics and ecology ask the programmer?  The fact is that they eat a great clock of the main program. <br><br>  <b>Diploma.</b>  The diploma project of a specialist must be completed.  The graduate work of a bachelor is a kind of ‚Äúresearch‚Äù on the topic.  Drive on the fog and pour water.  No design. <br><br><h1>  How to teach </h1>  The second problem: <b>our subjects are often taught without interrelation with each other and in isolation from the main specialty.</b>  Teachers do not bother to explain why their subject matter is needed, what disciplines are related, how will this be needed in practice?  It is not necessary: ‚Äã‚Äãunlike foreign students, we simply have no choice - almost all subjects are required.  <b>The lack of elective disciplines is another flaw.</b>  Of course, the standard includes hours for courses chosen by the student, but in real life it all remains on paper. <br><br>  As a result, the <b>quality of training of graduates and their competence does not meet the expectations of the business.</b>  And on the contrary, the offers on the labor market do not meet the expectations of graduates :) One of the reasons for this is that the business is weakly cooperating with universities - he wants to get good specialists ‚Äúon a silver platter‚Äù, without costs. <br>  <i>What should be able to specialist in terms of the largest IT firms can be found <a href="http://www.apkit.ru/committees/education/meetings/standarts.php">here</a> .</i> <br><br>  The rest is a list - this has already been talked about a million times: <ul><li>  <b>Weak technical equipment.</b>  Not every university will show you a real server or a powerful switch. </li><li>  <b>Teaching Staff.</b>  Grows old and loses qualifications.  Specialists from the industry a little.  <i>Who will read the course on ERP for a salary of 12,000 rubles.?</i> </li><li>  <b>Tutorials.</b>  I do not know how it was with you, but all our books were only of Soviet times. </li><li>  <b>English.</b>  As a rule, weak and not related to IT. </li><li>  <b>Control.</b>  The state controls the work of the university poorly.  Certification of universities is inefficient and corrupt. </li><li>  <b>Information support is lame.</b>  Who will you become, what disciplines will be taught, what does the graduating department do - many will learn only by the third year when it is too late to change something. </li></ul>  What can be concluded?  Very trivial: <b>if you want to become a good specialist, you can not rely only on the university!</b> <br>  You will say "yes it is already clear to everyone."  I don‚Äôt know, this was incomprehensible to me when I was 17 years old. <br><br><h1>  What to do? </h1>  If you are going to enroll at the Moscow Medical University, at the Physics and Technology Department or study abroad, then you can not read further :) Text for the average applicant / student. <br><br>  To those who are still going to do, I would advise the following: <ul><li>  Do not enter a non-core university. </li><li>  Do not apply for any specialty. </li><li>  Apply for an accredited specialty. </li><li>  Do not enter the evening, correspondence and distance education - most often it is a bullshit.  In any case, just worse than the day. </li><li>  Be wary of non-state universities.  While it is better to enter the state. </li><li>  Try to find out about the department at which you enroll.  But you still can not guess: in my university, two specialties with the largest competition were taught very badly, and the average is quite decent. </li></ul>  Specialties for IT personnel: <ul><li>  230100 Informatics and computer engineering - sysadmin, networker, programmer </li><li>  230400 Information systems and technologies - analyst, designer of IP </li><li>  230700 Applied Informatics - an analyst, designer of IP </li><li>  231000 Software engineering - tester, programmer, software designer </li><li>  231300 Applied Mathematics - Programmer </li><li>  010200 Mathematics and Computer Science </li><li>  010300 Basic informatics and information technologies - programmer, software designer (?) </li><li>  010400 Applied Mathematics and Computer Science - Programmer </li><li>  010500 Software and administration of information systems - programmer </li><li>  080500 Business Informatics - Analyst, Manager </li><li>  090301 Computer Security - Security Manager </li><li>  09030 * Information Security ... - Security Manager </li></ul>  The profession is very approximate.  This is my personal guess, do not take it for 100% truth.  Maybe someone from the readers will correct me. <br><br>  Specialties: <ul><li>  210700 Infocommunication technologies and communication systems </li><li>  220400 Management in technical systems </li><li>  220700 Automation of technological processes and production </li><li>  221000 Mechatronics and Robotics </li><li>  221700 Standardization and Metrology </li></ul><br><br>  I advise you to read the educational standard for your specialty: a <a href="">list of educational standards</a> , a <a href="">rubricator of specialties</a> .  Consider that the codes of specialties have changed already 2 times, for example, ‚ÄúInformation systems and technologies‚Äù were 071900, then 230200 became, and now 230400. <br><br>  So, if you are in the Russian technical high school of the average level on a computer specialty: <ul><li>  Do not relax the first two courses. </li><li>  After the second course, try to find a part-time job that does not interfere with your studies.  Load no more than half-time.  You can get to the department, then some buns are possible. </li><li>  Independently improve qualifications.  Learn languages, technology.  You can go to courses, but then you need to clearly understand why they are for you, if you have the required preliminary training - otherwise you will waste time and money in vain. </li><li>  Watch for conferences, webinars, courses.  Many of them are free for students. </li><li>  If a ‚Äúwindow‚Äù has been formed, it is not necessary to sit in a cafe: there is a reading room at the institute, and periodicals in it.  Read industry journals: Open Systems, System Administrator, etc. </li><li>  If you have an internship, try to get it.  Bald in the summer of 2.5 months - a luxury. </li><li>  Learn English.  Set a goal to get extra.  higher education in language or certificate type FCE. </li><li>  Try to be creative in solving problems.  For example, in a course project on programming, add additional functionality from yourself - it will be interesting to you and will ensure a good attitude of the teacher to your work. </li><li>  Write a "decent" diploma.  Try to make it a real development, not a thought spreading through the tree.  Even better, if you implement it in the enterprise and sign the act of implementation. </li></ul><h1>  What's next? </h1>  At the end of the bachelor degree study the possibility of admission to the magistracy  How ‚Äústrong‚Äù is it in your university?  Maybe you should enroll in another university or change a little specialty? <br>  Recently, serious paid magistracies with a high level of training (for example, <a href="http://academy.ibs.ru/content/aca/rubr130/rubr-1300.asp">tyts</a> , <a href="http://www.academy.it.ru/ru/program/school/business/magistr/index.php%3Fproduct_id4%3D8401">tyts</a> ) have appeared. <br><br>  Arguments for admission to the magistracy: <ul><li>  The load in the magistracy less, especially do not have to strain. </li><li>  Employers tend to consider a bachelor's degree "incomplete higher." </li><li>  You can adjust the specialty of bachelor - go to the adjacent. </li><li>  Postponement from the army. </li><li>  Further admission to graduate school. </li></ul><br>  -------- <br>  I hope my advice will be, if not a guide to action, so at least food for thought for freshmen :) <br>  Another couple of useful topics <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/study/81752/">tyts</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126619/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126619/</a></p>
