But I left the main question unopened: where to send a presentation and, sending, how to understand that it does not rest in the ‚ÄúSpam‚Äù box of the advertiser, but at least it was read. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I did not send my presentation to an astronomical number of "establishments" before I sold a special advertising project to Garmin, but only in a dozen places.  I tritely analyzed those areas of business that may be useful to the audience of my project.  Considering that my subject matter is very narrow, everyone, I am sure, will easily understand what kind of businesses they are - they are all visible in one way or another in the interests of autotourists. <br><br>  In addition to sending the presentation, it is desirable to ‚Äúfix the result‚Äù by calling.  A banal truth, but many are afraid of live communication, for example, thinking that a glossy presentation will ‚Äúhook‚Äù a potential advertiser more effectively than confused tales to the company's manager about all the advantages of your offspring by phone.  But as if not so!  The presentation may hang in the "Spam" advertiser, if it is eloquent not to "encourage" the person in charge of reading it to look at it -) <br><br>  One of these calls in my case was a call to Garmin‚Äôs Moscow office.  But there they completely culturally explained to me that with all sorts of things concerning advertising and PR for them is engaged one advertising agency, whose phone they gave me.  An advertising agency became interested in my site as one of the potential ones for offering to Garmin.  Only three months after I got into their base sites, I was contacted and offered accommodation. <br><br>  <i>Tip 10:</i> Better than living human communication, IMHO, nothing has yet been invented.  And, despite all the gloss and brilliance of the presentation materials, without a competent reinforcement of them with your oral story, again, IMHO, you will not go far, and the materials may not be seen at all.  Therefore, I advise you to pay as much attention as possible to phone calls or even, if you have time, personal meetings with your potential advertisers to present your site. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 11. Legal matters</b> <br><br>  In the comments to the previous topic, the topic of <u>mechanisms of</u> interaction of the advertising platform with the advertiser was reasonably raised (whether it is an agency or a direct advertiser - it does not matter).  Yes, for the Russian reality, in my opinion, for the time being, IP was better for nothing!  The opinion is not quite true that many LLCs cannot communicate with Ipshka.  Maybe for the trade it is more important, but for the provision of advertising services on the Internet - just right! <br><br>  <i>Tip 11:</i> If you are sure that you do not give up your lesson halfway and certainly want to achieve a result, then go ahead to <a href="http://www.klerk.ru/">www.klerk.ru</a> and <a href="http://www.klerk.ru/">go</a> to the tax register of individual entrepreneurs.  Not really it is difficult and expensive, and profit - on the face.  Yes, even in the famine years, this particular IP is always adapted to engage in taxi activities (by the way, I‚Äôm very serious) or trade in slippers))) Gather yourself the maximum number of activities according to OKVED (All-Russian Classifier of Economic Activities) - what‚Äôs really will have to do over time.  By the way, even to work with such contextual advertising systems as the same POPP, at least an IP will be needed anyway, so, in my opinion, this must be done without fail. <br><br>  <b>Chapter 12. Figures financial</b> <br><br>  Well, citizens, those who so wanted to see "Finestriptiz" - I will try to please) Again, I will not apply scans of payment orders (I mean, disclose specific digits), but I will give a link to the page " <a href="http://www.avtoturistu.ru/page/reklama">Advertising on Avtotourist.Ru</a> ", which, I am sure, many have already seen without my filing.  At the prices presented in the presentation, it is possible to make only an <u><i>INDICATIVE</i></u> conclusion as to what income I have from selling advertising on the site.  Again, why indicative: you need to take into account the discount provided by the advertising agency;  special agreements on prices are not in the form of retail sales of banner places, but of an integrated special project (such as an OPT), ‚Äúbonuses‚Äù from a ‚Äúchef‚Äù (which in a special project is not priced, but as a gift);  seasonal factors and so on.  Therefore, having summed up the prices in the price list and multiplying them by the number of seats sold, an accurate picture of the profitability of the project, of course, will not be possible to see.  But, understanding the approximate level of discounts from sites to advertising agencies, and taking away the NN amount from the resulting (that ‚Äúbonus‚Äù), you can easily orient yourself))) <br><br>  <i>Tip 12:</i> Be flexible in communicating with customer representatives.  Come up with various ‚Äúbonuses and discounts‚Äù, discuss options acceptable to both parties.  For example, you do not need to stand in the figure of 40,000 rubles for such a position and thus remain with nothing to throw off the interest, but agree on a seasonal coefficient by which you will be able to compensate for lost profits in the form provided (more than planned) discounts. <br><br>  I thought I would finish this, fourth part, a series of my publications, but I remembered that there are a couple of interesting points related to the development of the community, which I could share in probably the final, fifth part.  Therefore, if there is interest, I will try to "nakalyakat" and another couple of tips-) <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/startup/111148/"><b>Ready for the fifth part!</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110582/</a></p>
