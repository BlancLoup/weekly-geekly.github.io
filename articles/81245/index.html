  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Philips SoundBar or Ponte in its pure form</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A couple of months ago, one of my friends happily told me about the purchase of a new Philips music center.  According to her, when she saw this miracle in the store and heard how it sounds, she could not tear herself away and went bankrupt, having bought this device for almost 15 000 rub. <br><img src="http://s3.sendpic.ru/i/10119/i/dR.jpeg"><br>  Slightly taking advantage of the price, I decided to dig a little on the Internet, on the subject of compromising on this overgrown radio tape recorder. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Information from the official website states that the Philips SoundBar is a home theater with DVD.  Well, the cinema, so the cinema. <br>  Let us omit the reasoning that it recognizes video only in the format DivX3.x-5.x and Mpeg1-2, it is not clear in which containers.  Music only in MP3, WMA, with a bitrate of 32-256 Kbps and VBR.  And it already calls into question its daily use. <br>  We will touch only what is announced loudly and shamelessly. <br><br>  Quote from the official site: <br>  ‚ÄúLiven up your movie with great surround sound.  Thanks to the sound power of 100 W, the built-in DVD player and subwoofer, as well as the increase in quality to HDMI 1080p, you can now enjoy movies with high picture and sound quality and without cable clutter! ‚Äù <br><br>  Solid dust in the eyes.  "... Sound power 100 W" - about this below.  "... integrated DVD player" is yes.  "... quality upgrade to HDMI 1080p" - what quality enhancement?  (where is the noun? Who wrote this at all?).  "... and without cable clutter" - i.e.  TV and network are connected without wires? <br>  Now about the sound. <br>  We read the user manual: <br>  ‚ÄúThe nominal output power of the amplifier is 2x50W.‚Äù <br>  Attention question: And how many columns issue to us? <br>  We read: <br>  "Speaker impedance - 2x8 ohm <br>  Driver dynamics, fundamentals - 3 '' woofer (what is it at all?) <br>  Driver dynamics, tweeter - 19mm tweeter (and this is what and why is measured in mm.?) <br>  Sensitivity&gt; 83 dB / m / W "

      Everything.  Not a word about the output power, although it is she who is the main characteristic of the dynamics.  There is also no frequency response. <br>  2x50 - this is how much the amplifier can give to the speakers, but then we hear not the amplifier, but the speakers. <br>  With the same success, sausage producers can say ‚Äúyou will enjoy the taste of real meat!‚Äù, Because meat is really involved in the production of sausage.  But although ... No, it participates, participates. <br><br>  We read further about the characteristics of the amplifier: <br>  "Frequency response 20-20 kHz, plus or minus 3 dB" <br><br>  I remind you that such a value as the frequency response is characterized by the amplitude of the output signal of the system in <strong>decibels</strong> and the phase in <strong>radians</strong> at different frequencies.  Even if we assume that 20‚Äì20, these are ‚Äúdifferent frequencies‚Äù, and 3, these are the same decibels, then where is the phase in radians?  And in general, the characteristics of which amplifier are given, if there are several of them? (And there are several of them). For example, I am interested in the output amplifier, which provides sound to the speakers.  The characteristics of which amplifier are given, for me, remains a mystery.  It also remains a mystery to the frequency range of the output amplifier, which is exactly what my ears take from the speakers. <br><br>  I will not go further on the other characteristics, although there are also a lot of questions - if you wish, you can familiarize yourself on the official website.  Let me down sad outcome: <br><br>  We sell a beautiful wrapper, masking a shit inside, enveloping it in beautiful phrases and loud statements.  I‚Äôm probably not going to be surprised now, having opened the corps of an expensive apparatus and saw last year‚Äôs Chinese newspapers as isolation between the boards.  And even if all of a sudden, the consumer takes an interest in what is inside, they are given a multitude of numbers, values ‚Äã‚Äãand values, after which he must immediately understand the seriousness of the equipment and its nearness in technical matters, close the page with characteristics and not open it again to avoid turning brains.  Meanwhile, the importance of that information tends to zero, but, on the contrary, important information is held back.  Is it really so bad that it‚Äôs scary to even write about it?  Is it really so expensive to shove an amplifier that gives out at least 20 kHz?  True, 50 W speakers, perhaps, will not even fit there. <br><br>  Well, maybe I'm wrong and this is not a piece of shit, but what exactly is inside the case, only the engineers of the manufacturer know.  Marketers, on the other hand, seem to be holding consumers for sheep, who don't understand anything and don't read anything. <br><br>  Or maybe it is? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81245/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81245/</a></p>
