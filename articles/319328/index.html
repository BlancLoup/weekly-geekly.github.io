For this purpose, we appealed to OAO T-Platforms with a request to provide products to us for testing.  Despite the fact that demand for Tavolgi on the domestic market is very high, and deliveries are scheduled for many months to come, our reputation and courtesy of T-platforms representatives allowed us to quickly get a prototype of the workstation for testing, we consider it possible to share the results. <br><br>  This is what Tavolga Terminal TP-T22BT represents according to the manufacturer: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f72/31d/8f5/f7231d8f5ed46b0e2ee261f4c69399f0.jpg"></div><br><blockquote>  Form Factor: Monoblock <br>  Display: 21.5 "(54.6 cm), IPS, 16: 9, Full HD 1920 √ó 1080, LED backlight <br>  Processor: Baikal-T1 (MIPS P5600, 2 cores) <br>  Memory: 2 to 8 GB DDR3 <br>  Local storage: 8 GB NAND Flash (optional) / 8 GB Disk-on-Chip SSD (optional) / 2.5 ‚ÄùSATA SSD (optional) <br>  Graphics adapter: SM 750, 16 MB of video memory <br>  Sound: PCM2912A codec / Built-in stereo speakers 2 √ó 2.5 W <br>  External connectors: 4 √ó USB 2.0 / 1 x PS / 2 / Device for working with smart cards / Device for working with SD / SDHC / SDXC / MMC / MS memory cards / 3.5 mm single input for stereo headset (TRRS CTIA / AHJ) / Kensington lock slot <br>  Network capabilities: 2 √ó 100/1000 Mbit / s Ethernet RJ-45 (8P8C) or <br>  1 √ó 100/1000 Mbit / s Ethernet RJ-45 (8P8C) / 1 √ó port for SFP module (100/1000 Mbit / s) <br>  OS Support: Linux distributions based on Debian <br>  Power supply: 110‚Äì230 V, 50/60 Hz AC <br>  Accessories: Keyboard (wired, USB) / Mouse (wired, USB) <br>  Operating Conditions: Allowable Temperature: 0 to 40 ¬∞ C / Relative Humidity: 20 to 80% non-condensing <br>  Warranty: 3 years </blockquote><br>  The sample provided to us for testing differed in a number of points from the indicated characteristics, but the general idea is clear.

      The computer "Tavolga Terminal" and the Baikal-T1 processor are developed in Russia and manufactured in China. <br><br>  As is known from the press, T-Platforms, an independent computer technology developer, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/174775/">is under the unfriendly attention of the US government</a> , therefore it works only with the civilian sector and supplies Tavolga with a preinstalled Debian 8 OS (mipsel).  However, we can hardly imagine the scenario of using a domestic computer with a foreign OS, so we did not conduct any experiments with Debian, but turned to JSC ‚ÄúNPO‚Äú RusBITech ‚Äù, with which we have a long experience of joint work, and received from them for testing the working version of the domestic OS Astra Linux Special Edition of the release "Sevastopol", intended for the MIPS platform.  In the future, Sevastopol should become a commercial release of a protected OS for MIPS, similar to Smolensk for Intel, but so far (in January 2017) its development has not been completed, and it exists in the form of working assemblies, currently based on the 3.19 core . <br><br>  So what happens after power on? <br><br>  The loading process of Tavolgi is organized using the <a href="http://www.denx.de/wiki/U-Boot/WebHome">U-Boot</a> bootloader, stitched in the system board, whose interface and other boot information are available through a special non-standard service connector.  For the end user, only the graphical interface of the OS is available, which appears after the end of its automatic download.  The black screen after switching on is replaced by a graphical Linux login. <br><br>  "Tavolga-Terminal" is focused on the use in a corporate environment and does not involve the installation of the operating system by the end user.  To reinstall the OS, a non-standard pinout cable is now needed, through which the MIPS text console is brought to another, the service computer, and the skills of a system administrator at the level of command of the U-Boot bootloader.  Scratching the bootloader, we were able to run the Astra Linux installer.  The installation process itself is performed automatically and is not fundamentally different from the Smolensk and Orel releases for the Intel platform. <br><br>  Booting into Astra Linux, we find ourselves in the exact same user interface as in the Smolensk and Eagle releases.  However, since the Baikal-T1 processor has a MIPS 32 (el) architecture that is incompatible with Intel, binary applications for Intel Linux cannot run on it.  Recompilation required. <br><br>  We have recompiled our programs for Intel-versions of Astra Linux without any difficulties and were able to run them in Sevastopol.  Everything works in exactly the same way as in Smolensk or Orel (taking into account, of course, that not all packages have been transferred in the current assembly of Sevastopol).  There are no difficulties with encodings, or with fonts, or with the layouts of screen forms - in general, with nothing that usually lurks the programmer when switching from one distribution to another.  Compatibility between releases of Astra Linux is provided perfectly.  It is also important that this platform uses little endian byte order (mipsel), corresponding to that adopted by Intel. <br><br>  The only thing that immediately attracts attention is performance.  Tavolga Terminal is positioned as a platform for thin clients, and in no way can replace a full-fledged workstation.  According to the results of synthetic tests and the implementation of practical tasks, it can be said that the performance of Tavolgi Terminal differs from modern Intel workstations by an order of magnitude and on some types of workloads and more.  Therefore, it is unrealistic to perform truly thick applications on ‚ÄúBaikal-T1‚Äù. <br><br>  On the other hand, low system performance leads to low heat generation.  The system unit is passively ventilated and does not contain any moving parts, during operation it is relatively cold and completely silent. <br><br>  We tested Tavolga in various modes of thin client operation: with recompiling client applications into native MIPS code, with remote launch from another machine using X window, with access via a web browser.  In all cases, the performance is quite enough for an uncomplicated interface, but you will not be able to twist some kind of powerful workload with fast intensive redrawing or complicated calculations. <br><br>  So, "Tavolga Terminal TP-T22BT" has its pronounced pros and cons. <br><br>  Pros: <br><br>  - a product of domestic development, can be used for import substitution; <br>  - nice design; <br>  - lack of moving and highly heated parts, suggesting long-term reliable operation; <br>  - Immunity to common viruses, focused on the platform of Intel; <br>  - immunity to third-party software brought by corporate users, including attempts to update the OS by the user; <br>  - the alleged absence of foreign ‚Äúbookmarks‚Äù in architecture; <br>  - full source code compatibility with Linux for the Intel platform. <br><br>  Minuses: <br><br>  - poor performance, making it impossible to execute thick applications; <br>  - a small amount of built-in flash drive (perhaps this issue will be resolved with shipments from SSD); <br>  - the obligation of a qualified system administrator to accompany the fleet; <br>  - impossibility of delivery for use in the military sphere due to restrictions of the US government; <br>  - Some experts consider the disadvantage of the inability to use Windows. <br><br>  In general, in our opinion, ‚ÄúTavolga Terminal TP-T22BT‚Äù, when used with Astra Linux OS, is quite a worthy product for the workplace of a linear employee of a large corporation, working with server resources: seller, teller or employee of a public institution, and also for control of technological equipment, if it does not require significant computational resources.  In such a workplace, it is difficult to do something extra that will undoubtedly please corporate system administrators. <br><br>  On the other hand, the replacement of a home computer or a powerful workstation "Tavolga Terminal" is by no means the case. <br><br>  Since corporate business is generally less inclined to innovate on its own initiative, the future prevalence of systems based on the Baikal-T1 processor, in our opinion, will mainly depend on two factors: the manufacturer‚Äôs ability to increase the volume of mass production and the activity of the Russian state in restrictions on budget purchases of domestic products.  At least, one can definitely say that for a Linux-programmer there is definitely nothing difficult in switching to this platform. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319328/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319328/</a></p>
