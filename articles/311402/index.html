  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cycle of articles "NetRack Guards: on guard of client IT infrastructure": a story about a man walking on roofs</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Have you ever wondered what the cooling system means for equipment, especially in such a structure as a data center?  In fact, without refrigeration equipment, the servers rented by you will not be able to work due to overheating, therefore there is always a person in the data center who is responsible not only for the condition of the refrigeration equipment, but also for its modernization to increase the efficiency of the infrastructure and, as a result, improve the quality of in it services.  It is worth noting that while the cooling system has never failed neither us nor our customers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0e/e10/22f/a0ee1022fe1f4acfaba53a4ae6a45a3e.JPG"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have already talked about working life of the chief engineer of the data center <a href="http://storedata.ru/">StoreData</a> , where our company is located.  Now we will talk about a person who should not be afraid of heights and low temperatures. <br><br>  On the roof, leaning on the side, stands a thin man, looking thoughtfully into the distance.  He often goes to work on the roof, especially in summer when the weather allows.  At the same time gives rest to the eyes, because he often has to sit at the computer.  Look straight ahead - in the distance you can see the dome of the Church of the Sorrow.  Turns to the right - sees two small red buildings, preserved from pre-revolutionary times (by the way, they were consecrated in 1903).  Looks around - and all is green.  He says that sightseeing is an important stage for him to climb up.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f9/c62/3ac/1f9c623acf764b2d8e7dbf84c881d368.JPG"><br><br>  The roof is a mandatory element of the daily round, which is performed by the refrigeration engineer Yevgeny Kolpashchikov.  It is important for him to know not only the state of the equipment, but also the state of the external environment.  Therefore, the case is never limited to a visual inspection.  On the roof, Eugene should listen carefully (how much the external units of air conditioners are noisy), assess the weather (hot or cold outside), find out if the roof is heating up, or if there is vibration amplification.  In addition, he must monitor the condition of the roof as a whole - this applies even to roofing work.  The frequency of visits depends on weather conditions: with an average temperature and no precipitation, it is possible to limit one rise.  If it is snowing on the street, a sharp increase or decrease in air temperature, it is necessary to check the equipment on the roof much more often: about three times a day.  Strange as it may seem, even how much the sun shines, or the sky is covered with clouds, can affect. <br><br>  Control of weather conditions, in principle, is an important aspect of the work of a refrigeration engineer.  Among other things, it is necessary to monitor the amount of precipitation.  For example, with the onset of winter, when snow falls sharply overnight, and the air conditioners need to be cleaned, despite the vertical blowing in the cars.  This has to be done infrequently, because dual-circuit machines - this means that when it stagnates, it switches from one air conditioner to another.  It is harder in the summer when everything is clogged with poplar fluff.  Eugene compares the care of the equipment with the care of the car: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about the same as if the flies got stuck in the radiator: it's unpleasant, but you need to clean it so that everything works correctly.‚Äù <br><br>  A refrigeration engineer is completely dependent on the weather, even vacation plans are based on the season.  Eugene has already verified the scheme: rest only in spring and autumn.  As he himself jokes, "I am tying him up to planting potatoes."  He often goes on vacation in cool May, before washing all the cars, and returns to the flowering poplars to personally monitor the cleanliness of air conditioners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e47/1c3/2bb/e471c32bbe92499084dd48f68c27d4b3.jpeg"><br><br>  If the ‚Äúrefrigeration engineer‚Äù did everything correctly with the weather conditions, then he calmly went to rest, leaving his domain under the authority of the duty service and the chief engineer.  ‚ÄúKonstantin is generally both an energy engineer and a refrigerator, so I am calm about the equipment,‚Äù notes Kolpashchikov. <br><br>  In addition to inspecting the roof, Eugene twice a day makes a daily detour of the data center equipment: in the morning - after talking with the duty officers - and in the evening - just before the end of the working day.  And, just like the chief engineer, Eugene begins his day with communication with the duty service.  He sees more of an educational moment in this: after all, besides the fact that he receives information about the condition of the equipment from the staff on duty, he also conducts continuous training so that in some simple cases employees can navigate on their own.  According to Eugene, since the daily duty officer performs quite a lot of operations, especially during the detour, he must understand, including what equipment and how to work.  Thus, it is possible to reduce the number of phone calls to technical support serving air conditioners of the data center. <br><br>  Kolpashchikov has already brought his communication with the attendants to a high level: they explain the problem to him, offer themselves some solution, and he confirms how right they are.  Of course, not in all matters: this is usually limited to pressing the right button directly from the room on duty or returning the elevated temperature to normal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba7/b8b/0cb/ba7b8b0cb48944ce82b1d3f4c11b102a.JPG"><br><br>  The day of the refrigeration engineer is not always the same.  For example, the same daily round may turn into a consultation of a client who came to the data center.  In general, Eugene daily checks the temperature at the outlet of the rack, the possibility of overheating of the equipment, and also controls the operation of the refrigeration circuit itself.  According to our hero, refrigeration equipment is a mixture of mechanics and electronics, so the engineer needs to monitor not only the instrument readings, but also the condition of the machines themselves.  Anyway, the vibration still leads to damage, which you need to know in time.  Working with refrigeration equipment requires increased care: you need to notice the oil leakage in time, closely monitor temperature fluctuations and humidity levels.  In addition, it must be borne in mind that any changes in the operation of one machine may trigger a chain reaction, which will affect the operation of all equipment. <br><br>  Maintaining the right and comfortable temperature takes the most time.  And sometimes you have to not only follow the indicators, but also ‚Äúget deeper‚Äù, changing the service settings.  The last operation has to be carried out at all during each change of season: at different times of the year, the equipment operates in different ways. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc8/de0/f12/dc8de0f12fe74fee99926229591f1b39.JPG"><br><br>  When the round is over, according to its results, Evgeny fills out two journals: handwritten and electronic.  In them he records exclusively those events that deserve attention in order to see the general picture of the state of refrigeration equipment.  It will be easier for them to understand how well the machines ‚Äúwork out‚Äù and whether their replacement will be required.  The purchase of equipment is also managed by Kolpashchikov.  He negotiates with companies that send tender proposals for new cars, conducts a comparative analysis, and then presents his decision to management.  In addition, control of equipment costs is on his shoulders.  For example, at the moment Eugene is in the process of preparing a technical task for a Russian manufacturer of fans, which may be replaced by imported ones due to their wear. <br><br>  Kolpashchikov is also responsible for scheduled inspections of machines under his "jurisdiction".  As the chief engineer Konstantin "brings the diesel generators to white heat," so does Evgeny, together with the service company, check all air conditioners.  Checks take place in several stages: once a week, each air conditioner is examined in turn, quarterly - the entire system.  From this it follows that during the year, each machine in the test mode ‚Äúexperiences‚Äù a critical state, be it an accident or a simple leak.  Such a phased work with the equipment allows you to calculate any kind of emergency situations and prevent them in advance.  It is worth noting that so far no damage has occurred in the StoreData data center. <br><br>  Any data center is filled with engineers, however, according to Eugene, each of them is a creative and professional person.  ‚ÄúThis is exactly what I love most about this job: here you can meet with real professionals,‚Äù says the engineer.  He strongly supports the position of the CEO - openness in communication - and always takes the opportunity to communicate directly with customers and service companies.  ‚ÄúFor example, a client arrives with a check.  Firstly, they ‚Äúrun in‚Äù themselves in this way, and secondly, we find something new for ourselves, ‚Äùexplains Kolpashchikov.  The refrigeration engineer of the Data Center StoreData generally tries every day to look at its work in a new way: to evaluate this or that situation from a completely different side, or, for example, to start analyzing the situation and possible solutions, and then go to check the equipment. <br><br>  ‚ÄúYou know, the data center is like a submarine,‚Äù says Eugene unexpectedly, smiling at his memories.  And Kolpashchikov can talk about such a comparison, because in his youth he served in the technical crew of a submarine in the region of Murmansk.  A little later, Eugene adds that the work is performed on a similar principle: the same redundancy schemes, the same compactness of equipment.  It is worth noting that Kolpashchikov was not originally an engineer by training: he studied geological exploration.  After the institute, I got into a company that worked with the Institute of Applied Biotechnology, where I acquired new technological knowledge at the same time.  Prior to the position of engineer of refrigeration equipment, the path was not close: installation and commissioning of equipment, commissioning and service. <br><br>  Directly in the StoreData data center, Eugene has been working for only two years, but he knows everything about his refrigeration equipment from the moment of construction: he took part in it from the technical side.  So Eugene is better than others not only about the work of refrigeration equipment, but also about all the equipment installed in StoreData. <br><br>  Extreme attentiveness, accuracy of actions and creative approach - approximately the way Eugene determines his formula for ensuring the smooth operation of the data center.  And this formula is valid: StoreData does not know any failures.  And when this data center does not know of failures, then our company <a href="http://netrack.ru/">NetRack</a> , which houses it, can guarantee its users constant access to the Network. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311402/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311402/</a></p>
