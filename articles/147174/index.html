  <section class="page js-page"><h1>All-Russian Meeting of System Administrators 2012</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According to the good old tradition, on the last weekend of July, all system administrators in Russia, the CIS countries, and far and near abroad gladly leave their cold server rooms, put up a camping tent, a sleeping bag, stuff a tambourine into a backpack and go to the Kaluga region in unison connect with thousands of like-minded people like him, and take part in the <a href="http://sletadminov.ru/"><b>2012 ACD Celebration</b></a> , timed to coincide with the celebration of the Day of the System Administrator. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ea/04c/5b0/9ea04c5b09696821c6980a8368bd692e.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is not just a professional holiday - this is a kind of New Year in the world of system administrators, the opportunity to take stock of the year, discuss problems in an informal setting that have been worrying the entire IT community lately or just meet old friends living thousands of miles away and have a great time over a cup of cold refreshing beer.  And what else does a system administrator need on a hot day in the middle of summer ?! <br><br>  The meeting of the ACD has become an annual event, which is timed to the celebration of the Day of the System Administrator.  The event has long won the love of many representatives of the IT-community in Russia, CIS countries, as well as system analysts from far and near abroad.  Glory of the ACD is growing every year, and the number of its participants has long exceeded 5,000 people. <br>  From the moment of the first Meeting in 2006, Softline has been the constant organizer and chief custodian of the traditions of the Meeting.  The event is traditionally held in the hospitable Kaluga region, the ACH Meeting 2012 is no exception.  This year, the organizers chose a new Glade of the Meeting, which was picturesquely spread out on the steep bank of the Oka River, and will hospitably receive all participants of the Meeting <b>from July 27 to July 29, 2012.</b>  <a href="http://sletadminov.ru/reg/">Registration</a> is in full swing! <br><br>  This year, the Meeting of the DSA will celebrate its seven-year anniversary.  ‚ÄúSeven‚Äù is a significant number, so the organizers are preparing a lot of surprises for the participants this year.  The main theme of the Meeting was selected <b>"Seven Sysadmin miracles"</b> , which will be traced in everything from the appearance of the field and ending with competitions and events.  Usually a lot of mysteries and secrets are associated with the number ‚Äúseven‚Äù, therefore the organizers of the Meeting decided not to deceive the expectations of the participants, and prepared a huge number of surprises that will satisfy even the most demanding system administrator.  The main mystery lies in the fact that the system administrators themselves invest in the concept of ‚ÄúSysadmin miracles‚Äù, but we can only find out this on the Rule.

      The events prepared by the organizers of the Meeting will be appreciated by even the most demanding participants. <br>  First of all, it is an extensive conference part, which will raise all the important issues that are disturbing the minds of system administrators and have worried the IT community throughout the year. <br><br>  Secondly, all participants will be invited to try their hand at sports competitions, or to prove themselves in one of the professional competitions, many of which have already become classics, such as throwing computer mice for accuracy or lifting a barbell from monitors.  Especially distinguished administrators traditionally will not remain without prizes and gifts from sponsors and organizers of the Event.  And, of course, nowhere without the traditional evening concerts, at which the already long-beloved bands perform to the loud applause of the admins.  And everything ends with a sysadminian disco and the Big Sysadmin Corstor, which heralds that a new sysadminian year has begun and exactly 365 days later, all of them will see each other again at the DSA 2013. But this will be a completely different story ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147174/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147174/</a></p>
