We just spoke with Sasha Orlov about project managers in customized development and how they differ from their colleagues outside the software industry.  The topic was spinning in my head, and here is the head of GTD about why some people are good at doing things, while others do at least something that‚Äôs a problem.

      The views expressed so coincided with my personal observations that I decided to just bring it completely. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Why the most brilliant of us linger the longest</b> <br><br>  Truly, the smartest of us have the most unreceived decisions and unprocessed items on the lists.  What is the reason?  Think about how our body reacts to the images that appear in the mind.  It turns out that the nervous system does not distinguish a vivid idea from reality. <br><br>  To prove it to yourself, imagine how you enter the supermarket and walk through the brightly lit department of fruits and vegetables.  Are you already there?  Well, now go to the trays with citrus - oranges, lemons, grapefruits.  Now find there a big bunch of lemons.  Next to them is a fruit cutting board and a knife.  Take one of these large yellow lemons and cut it into halves.  Feel the lemon flavor!  The fruit is so juicy that the juice is spilled on the board.  Now take half a lemon and cut it in half so that you have a quarter left in your hands.  Well, now remember how you ate lemons as a child ... Take your lemon wedge into your mouth and sink your teeth into it!  Crunch! <br><br>  If you followed my instructions, you probably noticed that the saliva content in your mouth has increased a little.  Your body really tried to absorb citric acid!  But she was only in your imagination! <br><br>  Great people are able to draw pictures in their imagination, present events faster and more colorful than everyone else. <br><br>  If your body reacts to the pictures that you draw in your mind, how can you feel, for example, remembering the calculation of taxes?  What pictures do you present?  ‚ÄúShit,‚Äù ‚ÄúForward‚Äù, competition, success, ‚ÄúI won!‚Äù?  Hardly.  If we proceed only from such considerations, who will resist more strongly the reminders of such projects - that is, who will hesitate with the affairs the longest?  Naturally, the most creative, sensitive and intelligent people!  Their impressionable consciousness allows them to clearly create nightmarish scenarios of project implementation activities and clearly represent all the negative consequences of its incomplete implementation!  They immediately begin to worry and give up! <br><br>  Who does not give up?  Often it is the thick-skinned bumpkins, who get down to business and stubbornly move forward, unaware of all sorts of dangers.  And all the others tend to hang their nose for any reason. <br><br>  Count taxes?  Well, I do not!  It will not be so easy to do.  I am sure that this year everything will be different.  I saw the forms of the documents - they look different.  Probably, they came up with new rules that I will have to figure out.  I may have to read all these damn materials.  Long form, short form, medium form?  Put it all together or sort by individual folders?  It would be nice to ask for a tax cut, but there must be a reason for this, which means that all checks and receipts will be needed.  Oh dear - I don't know if all the necessary receipts are in place, and if we cannot find them, but ask for a tax cut, we can be checked!  Check?  TAX Internal Service, PRISON - No, thanks! <br><br>  This is how a mass of people are already imprisoned, barely looking at tax forms 1040. Just because they are such impressionable, sensitive and creative people.  I don‚Äôt remember how many times I have observed this way of thinking over the years of training specialists: usually intelligent and educated people accumulated the largest mountains of raw material in their offices, homes and heads.  Most of the professionals I worked with had at least a few large, complex and shapeless projects that were cluttering the tables for papers or consciousness.  Seditious thoughts always shine in their minds: ‚ÄúIf we don‚Äôt look at these projects or think about them, then maybe they won‚Äôt bother us!‚Äù <br><br>  Just because the human psyche is so arranged, the field of project management (as the area where the main job is to make decisions, try and do) is contraindicated for creative and vulnerable people.  <b>Fat and lazy lodgers become good managers.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62069/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62069/</a></p>
