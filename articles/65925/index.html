You volunteered to take people, for a considerable amount of money, but there is no other choice.  You have to get there exactly, and this person seems to be known as a driver, reputation and all that, he said, it means he should do it.  You need to get there in a day, you agree with a reserve of 14 hours on the road and the driver says that it is not a problem and agrees. <br><br>  The driver to the meeting place is late for an hour, while telling in what a terrible traffic jam, but in the background you can hear the waiter taking orders from someone.  When you decide to spit on this case, the driver announces and says that everything is OK and we will go, just a little faster. <br><br>  Every traffic cop stops him on the road, he constantly strives to turn somewhere from a straight road to a place, telling that it is faster, but he constantly has to return because the ‚Äúfast road‚Äù leads to a dead end

      You have to tell him where to go, remind him to slow down in front of populated areas and that in order to drive onto the bridge crossing the road and drive along it to the left, you have to turn behind the bridge and not before and try to find a U-turn. <br><br>  After 20 hours of driving, you still drove into the neighborhood of the place where you need to get there, but 50km from the target, the driver drops you off in some deaf village and demands you give him 95% of the money because he tried, wasted time, drove and even almost reached, just a little bit did not have time.  Now he needs another place urgently, but tomorrow he will definitely come back and take you. <br><br>  Often faced with such drivers? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I do not think.  As, in other matters, and with other people that trade with private orders and piece-work.  Almost with all. <br><br>  There are categories of performers who consider it normal to thwart all the deadlines, do the work as clumsily as possible, constantly correct the errors pointed to by the customer and who say that the work was not checked at all by the performer himself.  And while demanding money.  Everything is better, but even 95% is enough, in principle, the work has not been completed. <br><br>  Freelancers - site builders are probably the clearest example of such people.  Rather, among this category of freelancers, such performers are so often encountered that sometimes the choice of a performer for a time-critical project becomes an almost impossible task, not only for inexperienced people, but also for those who have been working in web development for several years. extensive experience with contractors. <br><br>  No fame, prestige, reputation does not prevent to start development at the time when half should be ready, to do with the left foot for 3 hours a week (although the plans are full day), to show the customer a website full of bugs with a third functionality which clearly shows that the developer himself did not even try to test. <br><br>  And of course, not even fixing a list of specific flaws that the customer found and which were recognized by the freelancer as flaws, to demand money.  After all, he worked, spent time, just did not finish it.  Now he needs to throw to the sea, but then he will come as soon as he finishes. <br><br>  Would you pay money from the beginning of the topic?  Do you often observe such frames?  I do not think that many people will have at least one positive answer to these questions. <br><br>  Why, with all this, even reputable and well-known freelancers strive to do a shitty and not completely, squeeze dough and look for the next order?  Why are unfinished projects considered to be completed, if they have done at least more than 80%?  Why consider that for a project made on, say, 70%, the customer must give at least 70% of the money?  Why they do not care about the question of what to do with the project, which is not made to the end, then? <br><br>  Questions, of course, rhetorical, and there is hardly any answer "such mentality".  The mentality of such a large number of representatives of this type of hard workers is that it is often impossible to find an adequate person for a domestic project.  Authority affects no more than <br><br>  But what do you think, is it normal to do a project by 95% and ask for money for it?  Is it normal to pay for such a project at least something?  What is the difference between a freelance website builder and a driver in this context? <br><br>  <sub>ZY</sub>  <sub>I do not like to save on the right things, I am willing to pay much more than the market price where we need increased reliability.</sub>  <sub>Ready to go to a meeting, even part of the work to take in a critical situation.</sub>  <sub>I am ready to spend time and energy on searching and selecting performers, reading reviews, watching a portfolio, google just by last name or, say, mail and see where else a person is glowing.</sub>  <sub>Yes, and I do, in general, all this.</sub> <br><br>  <sub>It does not help.</sub>  <sub>I work with many contractors, but I sincerely advise you not to get involved with freelancers if there is any way to do without it.</sub> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/65925/">https://habr.com/ru/post/65925/</a></p>
