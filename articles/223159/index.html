    <h3>  Management System and Operating System </h3><br>  Lenovo EMC networked storage runs on EMC LifeLine, a Linux-based operating environment that provides built-in management and integration tools, as well as access to third-party applications.  LifeLine provides access to sub-file deduplication of backup data, as well as support for integrated IVX visualization technology for simultaneous management of multiple virtual machines on the px12-450r.  In addition, Windows Distributed File Network (DFS) support allows you to organize network files into a combined directory tree.  LifeLine also provides additional capacity by adding USB hard drives as shared resources. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5a7/ac3/42a/5a7ac342ab64bce7ae3fe3da157d323e.jpg"></div><br>  LenovoEMC px12-450r NAS can run video monitoring installed in Mindtree software.  In addition, the device is supplied with the Mindtree SecureMind VSMS software with the ability to use it on one camera.  The LenovoEMC px12-450r can use up to 48 IP cameras along with additional integration with the Axis Video Hosting Solution (AVHS) for security and other video applications.  The LifeLine operating environment is compatible with third-party cloud services, including Amazon S3 or Mozy, as well as with the EMC Atmos Cloud Connector. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/95e/756/492/95e7564922c6f30bdb03717821137442.jpg"></div><br>  LenovoEMC Personal Cloud is a network architecture that connects other devices to your px12-450r via the Internet, including the ability to connect via iOS and Android applications.  When using multiple LenovoEMC storage in a company, the single operating system of the LenovoEMC products offers several advantages: for example, two px12-450r devices located in different places can be synchronized using a private Personal Cloud as part of a disaster recovery plan. <br><br><h3>  Testing Information </h3><br>  Providing an appropriate and holistic testing environment is a key aspect of testing.  If the hardware and infrastructure do not match the environment in which the equipment is deployed, the comparison may be meaningless.  Our laboratory pays special attention to <a href="http://www.saronit.ru/catalog/lenovo-servers">lenovo corporate servers</a> , as well as infrastructure equipment, such as networks, rack space, power management parameters, and similar hardware to properly assess the quality of the device.  Our testing is not paid for and not controlled by equipment manufacturers. <br><br>  LenovoEMC px12-450r testing was performed on a second-generation corporate platform on the Lenovo ThinkServer RD640.  This Windows-based test platform includes the latest interconnect hardware, such as the LSI 9207-8i HBA, as well as I / O scheduling optimization adapted to the best possible flash memory performance.  With synthesized testing, we use FIO version 2.0.10 for Linux and version 2.0.12.2 for Windows. <br><ul><li>  2 x Intel Xeon E5-2620 (2.0GHz, 15MB Cache, 6 cores) </li><li>  Intel C602 System Controller </li><li>  Memory 16GB (2 x 8GB) 1333MHz DDR3 Register Memory </li><li>  Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 64-bit, Windows Server 2012 Standard, CentOS 6.3 64-bit </li><li>  100GB Micron RealSSD P400e Boot SSD </li><li>  LSI 9211-4i SAS / SATA 6.0Gb / s HBA (for boot SSDs) </li><li>  LSI 9207-8i SAS / SATA 6.0Gb / s HBA (for SSD or HDD testing) </li><li>  Intel X540-T2 10GbE PCIe 2.1 Adapter </li><li>  Adapter Mellanox ConnectX-3 10GbE PCIe 3.0 </li><li>  Adapter Mellanox ConnectX-3 InfiniBand PCIe 3.0 </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Corporate Synthesized Workload Analysis </h3><br>  In accordance with the process of testing hard disks, we previously transferred each disk to a steady state with the same load.  The devices will be tested with a significant load of 16 threads with 16 queues in the stream, and then they will be tested with many variations of flows and queue depths to identify performance with low and high loads.  Since hard drives reach their nominal performance levels very quickly, we only outline the main sections of each test. <br><br><h3>  <b>Preliminary training and basic tests</b> </h3><br><ul><li>  Throughput (total I / O operations per second (IOPS) when performing read and write) </li><li>  Average latency (average latency while reading and writing) </li><li>  Maximum Delay Time (Maximum Delay Time for Read and Write) </li><li>  The standard deviation of the delay time (The standard deviation of the delay time when performing read and write) </li></ul><br><br>  The analysis of the corporate synthesized workload includes tests based on practical tasks.  These tests are designed to simplify comparison with past tests, as well as with widely publicized values, such as the maximum read and write speed of 4k, and also the ratio of 70/30 to 8K read and write operations, which is commonly used in corporate drives. <br>  <b>4k</b> <br>  <u>100% read or 100% write</u> <br>  <u>100% 4k</u> <br><br>  <b>8k 70/30</b> <br>  <u>70% read 30% write</u> <br>  <u>100% 8k</u> <br><br>  <b>128k (sequential)</b> <br><br>  <u>100% read or 100% write</u> <br>  <u>100% 128k</u> <br><br>  We evaluated the performance of the 1GbE and 10GbE interfaces.  To do this, we grouped the data and circuitry by test (4k, 8k, 128k) and the type of connection.  In each category, 1GbE interface data is first presented, then 10GbE data.  ISCSI is expected to show better performance because we use a Linux-based array.  In addition, when comparing certain data, we will focus on the totals. <br><br>  At the first corporate load of the 1GbE interface, for obtaining the main results, we measured a large randomly selected 4k performance sample with 100% write and 100% read.  The LenovoEMC px12-450r SCSI interface provides excellent read throughput at 2,153 IOPS, although it slows down a bit when writing. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/479/9c3/aa5/4799c3aa56bb866bf7571b031c5a2b08.png"></div><br>  In the main segment, the average delay time with a load of 16 threads (T) / 16 queues (Q), we found the average LenovoEMC px12-450r iSCSI delay when reading 238.42 ms, which is about four times less than the SMB.  The iSCSI delay in writing was 383.98 ms.  compared to 311.44 for SMB. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/633/8b3/f5c/6338b3f5c48dbaa82ed30b81ee5cbbdf.png"></div><br>  The maximum read latency results for the LenovoEMC px12-450r SBM are slightly higher than for iSCSI, at 1,116 msec ... While writing was significantly lower than iSCSI, 3,777.5 msec. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd6/2c5/516/dd62c5516f86427db12ca55fb3247cbf.png"></div><br>  When measuring the stability of the delay time 4k in the deviation section, the results of the LenovoEMC px12-450r SMB were 50.70 ms.  when reading and 496,17 msec.  when recording compared with the results of iSCSI 211, 00 msec.  and 1,056.30 ms.  respectively. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/978/a56/35e/978a5635e0daea33cbd8154d2d63de32.png"></div><br>  When testing the 10GbE interface to get the main results, we measured a large randomly selected 4k performance sample with 100% write and 100% read.  The LenovoEMC px12-450r iSCSI four times exceeded the SMB in reading bandwidth (2,119 IOPS), although when writing SMB it took the lead with a slight advantage by 16 IOPS. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fe2/9fc/8b0/fe29fc8b06678e24fa43e691e35e3285.png"></div><br><br>  With a 16T / 16Q load, measurements of the average reading delay showed 241.86 ms.  LenovoEMC px12-450r, which is four times less than the result of SMB.  When recording, the average iSCSI delay was 5 ms.  less. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fa1/820/118/fa18201182422330e72c7bc1380a5547.png"></div><br>  When measuring the maximum delay time when reading the LenovoEMC, the px12-450r iSCSI showed the best result of 800.5 ms.  However, the result when recording is 11 times higher at 47 021 ms.  compared to 4,242 ms.  u smb. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/762/97a/3f2/76297a3f263adc2c41124074cfe3bf4a.png"></div><br>  LenovoEMC px12-450r iSCSI showed a deviation of 222.83 ms.  when reading compared to the standard deviation of 50.92 ms.  u smb.  When measuring the lag time stability during recording, SMB again surpassed iSCSI with a score of 582.50 ms.  and 1,073.51 respectively. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8e5/3fd/f17/8e53fdf171912842aebbae0914019a3d.png"></div><br>  Unlike the maximum load with 16 threads and 16 queues applied during the 100% test 4k test, the mixed workload tests measure performance using a wide range of combinations of threads and queues.  In these tests, the workload varies from 2 threads and 2 queues to 16 threads and 16 queues.  Throughout the entire 8k 70/30 test, the Lenovo EMC px12-450r iSCSI demonstrated the best throughput with a maximum of 880 IOPS and stayed near this level for almost the entire test time. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4eb/097/2a0/4eb0972a0dc281a5560bcfab65ddc7fd.png"></div><br>  At 100% load, 8k LenovoEMC px12-450r iSCSI again demonstrated the best throughput at 28,677 IOPS when reading and 28,803 IOPS when writing. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c9/9d1/ea5/6c99d1ea593482b35f4ec6a1c428f444.png"></div><br>  When measuring the average delay time of the LenovoEMC px12-450r, iSCSI did not exceed 600 ms.  in comparison with 875 ms.  SMB. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/efc/6ca/f32/efc6caf32e9b2d817a5584397dcd44dc.png"></div><br>  With a different number of threads and queues, the maximum LenovoEMC px12-450r iSCSI delay time was 7,600 ms.  in comparison with 13 750 msec.  u smb. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b07/7d4/9f5/b077d49f5f6746c267fac152729abf29.png"></div><br>  On almost the entire load range of the LenovoEMC px12-450r, iSCSI and SMB are not inferior to each other.  Ultimately, the SMB time delay deviation is less than 900 ms.  in comparison with 1 100 msec.  iSCSI. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c8f/bde/ceb/c8fbdeceb596322299d8c5e743f281e8.png"></div><br>  Unlike the maximum load with 16 threads and 16 queues applied during the 100% test 4k test, the mixed workload tests measure performance using a wide range of combinations of threads and queues.  In these tests, the workload varies from 2 threads and 2 queues to 16 threads and 16 queues.  In this test, the LenovoEMC px12-450r iSCSI behaved consistently, often demonstrating 800 IOPS bandwidth and higher.  SMB reached 700 IOPS before falling with a maximum load of up to 500 IOPS. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/647/7b8/fdb/6477b8fdbe7e6eebb98b351fd5925eab.png"></div><br>  With a 100% load of 8k, the LenovoEMC px12-450r iSCSI bandwidth was almost four times the SMB bandwidth. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e63/227/c42/e63227c42d3940e1d3e0583896afb851.png"></div><br>  When measuring the average delay time, the LenovoEMC px12-450r iSCSI indicator did not exceed 625 ms, the SMB reached 975 ms ... <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8d5/cbc/f28/8d5cbcf28658c880aca5cf13173fe8fa.png"></div><br>  With a different number of threads and queues, the maximum LenovoEMC px12-450r iSCSI delay time was 8,000 ms.  in comparison with 11 500 msec.  u smb. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/671/a7f/b0f/671a7fb0fe2321b04f96d47c2f209ea6.png"></div><br>  On almost the entire load range of the LenovoEMC px12-450r, iSCSI and SMB go side by side.  SMB as a whole showed the best result before the 16T8Q load, where the maximum iSCSI deviation was lower. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/af3/153/d73/af3153d73280d82b6f8f84b816839e9c.png"></div><br>  The next test in our analysis of corporate synthetic load is the test of 128k, which is a sequential control of a large block of data, showing the maximum sequential transfer rate for a hard disk.  With both 100% reading and 100% writing, the LenovoEMC px12-450r SMB shows the best results with 260,968 Kb / s and 345 759 Kb / s, respectively. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/440/4ba/988/4404ba988f3bb22ede2f2edac267b80c.png"></div><br>  When testing the 10GbE LenovoEMC px12-450r interface, SMB again demonstrated better throughput, both when reading and writing, at 1 233 985 Kb / s and 1 512 465 Kb / s, respectively. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11e/faf/c61/11efafc610e7b6cb7f75a1804206ea58.png"></div><br><h3>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h3><br>  The decision to rename the Iomega product family by the name of the owner companies indicates that Lenovo and EMC are committed to this line of software products.  The network storage array series enables Lenovo to offer storage that they didn‚Äôt have before and adds EMC recognition to small businesses, which could one day lead to a classic array of storage arrays and storage networks.  In particular, the px12-450r target audience is on the border of small and medium businesses and corporations, where the management of a joint venture is of great importance.  The px12-450r storage features a four-core Intel Xeon processor, backup, hot-swappable power, four-channel aggregation on Gigabit Ethernet interfaces, an optional dual-interface 10GbE network interface card, and EMC's influence on software development. <br><br>  When testing the Lenovo EMC px12-450r, we used a number of different configurations to get the most accurate results.  We tried the iSCSI and SMB protocols, expecting iSCSI results to be better because we used a Linux-based array.  In addition, we checked the standard 1GbE and additional 10GbE interface.  The results showed excellent performance of the LenovoEMC px12-450r, regardless of the Linux or Windows operating system, and yet with our iSCSI setting, the px12-450r gave a much higher bandwidth.  This was especially noticeable when testing the 8k interface 10GbE.  ISCSI throughput was almost four times higher, at more than 116,000 IOPS when reading and 91,000 IOPS when writing.  iSCSI also showed the best throughput at 4k and 8k 70/30, although it lost to SMB when tested at 128k.  SMB consistently maintained its advantage in measuring maximum latency and standard deviation, although iSCSI performed better on average latency at 4k and 8k. <br><br><h3>  <b>Benefits</b> </h3><br><ul><li>  Easy setup and management for quick launch </li><li>  Channel aggregation and other enterprise features with EMC LifeLine </li><li>  Ease of upgrading and maintenance thanks to the retractable controller unit </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <b>disadvantages</b> </h3><br><ul><li>  Compatible with 10GBase-T 10GbE interface only </li></ul><br><br><h3>  <b>Conclusion</b> </h3><br>  The LenovoEMC px12-450r offers small businesses a simple but well-designed networked storage array from Lenovo and EMC.
