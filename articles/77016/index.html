  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Many books, good and different</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My list of books that I want to read has grown considerably, thanks to the topic ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/books/76714/">stocking up for the winter</a> .‚Äù  Under the cut you will find a list of books compiled from the comments in that topic. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I tried to make a detailed list of books.  Do not forget, I did not read much of all this.  Therefore, sorting by topic is approximate.  In addition, there are not all the books mentioned in the comments, most likely there are no books mentioned in the last comments. <br>  The number in parentheses is the approximate rating of the book.  This is the number of advantages of comments in which the book is mentioned.  It can not be judged, a good book or bad.  For example, I will use it only to determine the order in which I will read these books.  If this number is not, then the number of pluses.  On some books this number is not, it means: <br><ul><li>  rating 0 </li><li>  I thought it necessary to remove it </li><li>  I forgot it :) </li></ul><br>  Book descriptions are text comments.  I almost did not change anything.  I have nothing to do with these descriptions directly. <br>  Unfortunately, I do not have enough mental health to mention all the authors of these comments.  I'm sorry. <br><br>  Go! <br><br><h4>  Popular science.  About science.  About life.  About work. </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>‚ÄúOf course you are joking Mr. Feynman.‚Äù Richard Feynman (36)</b> <br>  I am sure this book must read for everyone with a scientific mindset and profession.  A set of essays (in the form of memoirs) of the most fun physicist.  I know that biographies and memoirs are usually boring, but not in this case.  If Perlman's ‚ÄúEntertaining Physics‚Äù is applied physics for life, then this book is applied life for physicists :) You just wonder how interesting you can live and work if you approach everything from a scientific (experimental) point of view.  It will be useful to both programmers and testers :) not to mention any scientists. <br>  <a href="http://lib.rus.ec/b/134631">lib.rus.ec/b/134631</a> </li><li>  <b>"A Brief History of Time" Stephen Hawking (14)</b> <br>  Quite a famous book, very simply tells about the development of ideas about the world from a physical point of view.  The new edition also features colorful illustrations, besides there are references to many other physical works for in-depth study. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúBig, Small, and Human Mind‚Äù Penrose Hawking</b> <br>  A little repeats the "Brief history of time" at the beginning, but goes further and deeper into disputes on the topics of modern physics. </li><li>  <b>"Dialogues" Alexander Gordon (6)</b> <br>  No, not a book of course, transcripts of nightly broadcasts-dialogues of the television program ‚ÄúGordon‚Äù.  And, unlike Akunin, it is impossible to say that it is easy reading.  :) But how sometimes there are not enough such intellectual conversations here, in everyday language, from which you learn a lot of new and exciting.  Dialogues about everything: theology, cosmology, economics, living systems, physics, philosophy, etc.  In some places it is very abstruse, but each of them is two or three interlaced essays.  A lot of food, very satiating.  I have not yet mastered everything, but keep with the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreading with pleasure.  On an uninhabited island would take - that's for sure. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúLosing Innocence‚Äù by Richard Branson (7)</b> <br>  A book about how Virgin was created and developed. <br>  The company began with the sale of records by mail, but now they are building planes that can go into outer space.  A very interesting book for people who are starting to make their startup and learn to make money with their business. </li><li>  <b>"Elegant Universe" by Brian Green (10)</b> <br>  A book about string theory, quantum mechanics, the theory of relativity and, in general, about the structure of the universe, written in a clear language.  Should appeal to those who like the books of S.Howking. </li><li>  <b>"Selfish Gene" Dawkins (3)</b> <br>  Although it is about biology, but it‚Äôs very interesting and the approach is quite human. </li><li>  <b>"God as an Illusion" Dawkins</b> <br>  In the introduction, the author promises that turning the last page you will become an atheist.  Very interesting and informative reading.  Dawkins step by step, argument by argument, reveals his point of view - why he is against any religion. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúProof of God.</b>  <b>The Arguments of the Scholar Francis Collins</b> <br>  The book of the current head of the National Institute of Health of the United States and the former head of the project Human Genome, ‚ÄúProof of God.  Arguments of the scientist.  Very efficient and modern book showing how synthesis of scientific and religious pictures of the world is possible. </li><li>  <b>Collins-Dawkins discussion organized by Time Magazine (1)</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.ateismy.net/content/polemika/collins_vs_dawkins.html">www.ateismy.net/content/polemika/collins_vs_dawkins.html</a> </li><li>  <b>"The fabric of the cosmos.</b>  <b>The space, time and texture of reality "Brian Green (3)</b> </li><li>  <b>"The new mind of the king." Roger Penrose (7)</b> <br>  An excellent popular science book about modern ideas about the physical world.  (amended on the publication date 1990) <br>  The monograph of the famous physicist and mathematician Roger Penrose is devoted to the study of the problem of artificial intelligence based on a comprehensive analysis of the achievements of modern sciences.  Is mind modeling possible?  To find the answer to this question, Penrose discusses the widest range of phenomena: algorithmic mathematical thinking, Turing machines, complexity theory, G√∂del theorem, matter teleportation, quantum physics paradoxes, entropy, the birth of the universe, black holes, brain structure and much more. </li><li>  <b>"Kryptonomicon" Neil Stephenson (9)</b> <br>  What is this book about ... probably about cryptography :), and how it influenced the world during the Second World War, and how it influences in our time.  Despite the fact that the book has almost 1000 pages, it is read very easily. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúLook at the root!‚Äù Peter Makovetsky (7)</b> <br>  The book is a collection of tasks from various fields of science (mainly optics, astronomy, astronautics, etc.).  A distinctive feature of problems is the paradox of an answer or a question, which increases the interest of readers in an independent solution. <br>  Look at the root! </li><li>  <b>Schizmatrica by Bruce Sterling</b> </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúICona.</b>  <b>Steve Jobs ¬ªJeffrey S. Young, William L. Simon</b> <br>  The book is written about a person who is worth attention, about a person who changed the history of technology.  The true story of his life from birth to reaching heights.  In general, I advise, after reading, the opinion about this person has changed dramatically. </li><li>  <b>"Kanjawa essays" by A. Vurdov (2)</b> </li><li>  <b>"Black Swan" Nassim Nicholas Taleb. (5)</b> <br>  From the main heretic of Wall Street, who single-handedly opposed the Legion of futurists and analysts, Nassim Taleb turned into a figure whose influence extends far beyond the financial world. <br>  His ‚ÄúBlack Swan‚Äù for seventeen weeks kept the New York Times bestseller list and was translated into 27 languages. </li><li>  <b>"Entertaining Greece: Stories about Ancient Greek Culture" (1996).</b>  <b>Gasparov M. L. (1)</b> <br>  A popular book about ancient Greece, is very well written, and these are not separate ‚Äústories‚Äù at all, but a completely coherent review with deviations. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúCharlemagne.</b>  <b>Through the empire to Europe (1995?).</b>  <b>¬ªA. Lewandowski.</b> <br>  Excellent popular book about Charlemagne. </li><li> <b>"Koranic legends" by Mikhail B. Piotrovsky (2)</b> <br>  from the abstract: The presentation of Koranic legends and traditions, the analysis of their origins, their existence in pre-Islamic Arabia and the countries of the Arab-Muslim culture. </li><li>  <b>River Creek Shi Nai'an</b> <br>  Despite the fact that it was published long ago (XV century) is read very cheerfully. <br>  For everyone who is not interested in the East and mythology (probably, all the same was meant - "For everyone who is interested in the East and mythology") </li><li>  <b>"The man who took his wife for a hat" Oliver Sachs</b> <br>  The author is a neuropsychologist and a writer, well known in the states.  The book has become a bestseller and has survived five editions, in which O. Saks talks about his clinical cases related to brain disorders.  Very informative and interesting;  people with some disabilities can be observed in everyday life.  Sometimes I had to think: who is more normal - we, ordinary people (as we ourselves think), or his patients. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúPhysics of the impossible‚Äù Michio Kaku</b> <br>  The physicist talks about the current state of physics.  He examines various attributes of fantastic stories (invisibility, anti-gravity, teleportation, reading of thoughts) and tries to describe their implementation using well-known laws of physics.  It also shares information on current developments in various fields of physics.  Simple and clear language of presentation, modern physics and a constant return to science fiction make reading easy and fun. <br>  The book is available for reading at <a href="http://lib.rus.ec/b/146090">lib.rus.ec/b/146090</a> </li></ul><br><h4>  Russian classics. </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>"Anna Karenina" Leo Tolstoy</b> </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúCrime and Punishment‚Äù Fyodor Dostoevsky</b> </li><li>  <b>"The Brothers Karamazov" Fyodor Dostoevsky</b> </li><li>  <b>"Fathers and Sons" I.S.</b>  <b>Turgenev</b> <br>  It is interesting to observe the behavior of a person who does not see the authorities (nihilists) and how he generally copes with this, for example, when he falls in love.  Not very fun, but it is easy to read and makes you think in some places. </li><li>  <b>Verses by A.S.</b>  <b>Pushkin</b> </li></ul><br><h4>  Philosophy. </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>"Rabbits and boas" Fazil Iskander (6)</b> <br>  A fun and slightly sad philosophy for adults in the form of a fairy tale for children.  The relationship of the victim and the hunter, society and the individual, evil and good, science and illiteracy.  All this is mixed with boas and rabbits in this funny allegory.  Cheers up and at the same time develops analogical thinking. </li><li>  <b>The Recluse and the Six Fingers Pelevin (6)</b> </li><li>  <b>"Nika" Pelevin</b> </li><li>  <b>"Laughter of the Shaman" Serkin (2)</b> <br>  A peculiar view of the world, modern man and nature.  Periodically reread. <br>  Probably, fans of Castaneda will like it. </li><li>  <b>"Experiments" Michel Montaigne (6)</b> <br>  Very interesting book of 1580 edition.  It is written in such a way that it seems as if you are reading a modern work.  Plus the fact that each page is full of interned arguments giving a lot of food for questions. </li><li>  <b>"Lord is my broker" Christopher Buckley (4)</b> <br>  Unfortunately, I do not really know how to write reviews, but I can not refrain from recommending this book!  This is an ironic story about the attitude to money, and there‚Äôs a lot more to read, you won‚Äôt regret it. </li><li>  <b>"Notes on the Cat City" by Lao She</b> </li><li>  <b>"Letters of Balamut" Clive Lewis (6)</b> <br>  In form, these are letters that the older demon writes to his impostor-ward modem, instructing him in the wisdom of tempting human souls and keeping them on the way to hell.  In fact, this is a very precise reflection on how people think and why they are wrong about that.  In our age, when chaotic, clip thinking becomes not only the norm, but also a source of pride for some, Letters of the Balamut may even be more relevant than for Lewis's contemporaries. </li><li>  <b>Foucault's ‚ÄúPendulum‚Äù by Umberto Eco</b> <br>  Must read!  A brilliant parody analysis of the cultural confusion of modern consciousness.  The novel is sharply arguing with modern esoteric teachings, with Kabbalah, alchemy and conspiracy theories.  There is everything: satire, detective story, brilliant dialogues, interesting historical calculations, extraordinary atmosphere, impetuous plot. <br>  After this novel, any films, texts, and conversations about the Templars, Rosicrucians, Freemasons, and worldwide conspiracies will cause you only a condescending smirk.  ;) <br>  After reading the Pendulum, I finally fell in love with the atmosphere of the Old World :) <br>  I also recommend other works by Eco: short tales, his other novel ‚ÄúThe Name of the Rose‚Äù, ‚ÄúNotes on the Fields of the Rose‚Äù (containing analysis of the creative process, inspiration, muse), as well as political reviews and remarks (can be found on <a href="http://www.inosmi.ru/">www.inosmi.ru</a> ) . <br>  In 2009, his new book Vertigo (or rather, research work), cataloging the images of Western culture, came out, I will try to get it and read it. </li><li>  <b>"The amount of technology" Stanislav Lem</b> <br>  Philosophical treatise.  About what is technoevolution and a lot about what else.  <a href="http://lib.ru/LEM/summa/summcont.htm">lib.ru/LEM/summa/summcont.htm</a> </li><li>  <b>"The teachings of Don Juan" Carlos Castaneda</b> </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúKhazar Dictionary‚Äù Milorad Pavic</b> </li><li>  <b>"One Hundred Years of Solitude" Gabriel Garcia Marquez (8)</b> <br>  Mythical realism.  The product of the fifth grade of the Faculty of Philology.  For this work the author received a Nobel Prize. </li><li>  <b>"Autumn of the Patriarch" Gabriel Garcia Marquez</b> <br>  On the despotism and nature of the myth-making of the people. </li><li>  <b>"No one writes to the colonel" Gabriel Garcia Marquez</b> <br>  A short story in the spirit of Marquez.  Rock Band Bi-2 has a popular song of the same name.  Apparently Marquez also influenced them with his philosophy of mysticism and mythology. </li></ul><br><h4>  Adventure.  Science fiction. </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>"Stories about the pilot Pirks" Stanislav Lem (14)</b> <br>  Storybook.  Good, romantic and adventure, sometimes fun and very sci-fi.  I was amazed at how the lunar landscapes, features of lunar gravity, constructions, etc., are described in detail.  Plots very reminded Star Trek (in a good way).  The film "The Inquiry of the Pilot of the Pirks" was made on the basis of one of the stories of the collection <br>  <a href="http://lib.rus.ec/b/69882">lib.rus.ec/b/69882</a> </li><li>  <b>"Solaris" Stanislav Lem (2)</b> <br>  The greatest work of Stanislav Lem has become a classic of world prose of the XX century. </li><li>  <b>"Eden" Stanislav Lem (2)</b> <br>  One of the most exciting novels of Lem, combining the features of a rigid and dystopian SF. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúThe Ion Quotes‚Äù by Stanislav Lem (2)</b> </li><li>  <b>collection "Tales of Robots" Stanislav Lem (2)</b> </li><li>  <b>"Diary found in the bath" Stanislav Lem (2)</b> </li><li>  <b>Stories from the cycle "3 Laws of Robotics" Isaac Asimov (22)</b> <br>  Perhaps you have already read, but if not - read.  It is very interesting, from the programmer‚Äôs point of view, to look for flaws with the author of a seemingly ideal system built on 3 simple fundamental laws.  It is amazing how many scenes (exceptions) can be squeezed out of a set of simple rules.  Very positive effect on <br>  architectural skills :) And in general: it reads easily (like fairy tales in childhood), and meanders twist. <br>  <a href="http://lib.rus.ec/b/133610">lib.rus.ec/b/133610</a> </li><li>  <b>"Zodiac" Neil Stephenson (1)</b> <br>  About how one person is struggling with corporations.  It seems to be nothing special, but it is written very exciting, read in one breath. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúZen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance‚Äù Robert M Pirsig (7)</b> <br>  Reflections on life and all that in the form of a travel diary. <br>  It is worth reading, even if for you the motorcycle is just a vehicle. </li><li>  <b>"And the sound of thunder" ("A Sound of Thunder") Ray Bradbury (22)</b> <br>  The story about the time machine and the butterfly effect. </li><li>  <b>It will be a gentle rain ("There Will Come Soft Rains") Ray Bradbury (22)</b> <br>  Overnight, a catastrophe passed - the whole city was swept away by a nuclear tornado that left no one alive.  But in the one and only miraculously preserved house, the measured and settled daily routine continues - automatic systems at home prepare breakfast, clean the house, make the beds ... </li><li>  <b>"451 degrees Fahrenheit" ("Fahrenheit 451") Ray Bradbury (22)</b> <br>  The novel "451 degrees Fahrenheit" tells of a totalitarian society in which literature is banned, and firefighters should burn all the books that they find.  The author portrayed people who have lost contact with nature, with the intellectual heritage of mankind, with each other. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúSomething Scary Is Coming (Something Wicked This Way Comes)‚Äù Ray Bradbury (2)</b> <br>  awesome thing, the atmosphere of the ominous amusement park transferred very cool.  The translation ‚ÄúSomething terrible is coming‚Äù is the best. </li><li>  <b>The Story of Ice and Flame by Ray Bradbury (2)</b> <br>  About the world in which people live only seven days. </li><li>  <b>The Coming of the Night Isaac Asimov, Robert Silverberg (3)</b> <br>  A great story about what can be the simplest phenomenon in the world that has not known it for centuries.  I enjoyed reading and re-reading.  There are two versions - the original one, written by Asimov, and the extended one - revised in collaboration with Silverberg.  The whole intrigue is in the original version, but the extended one continues with more active adventures =) </li><li>  <b>"Valis" Philip K. Dick</b> <br>  If you can master.  I did it only from the second time, but the book is the cleverest, so many things are so accurately noticed and described there that you just wonder.  But some paragraphs must be read slowly and carefully 5 times in order to understand what is being said :), such is not an easy thing. </li><li>  <b>"City" Clifford Symak ‚Äã‚Äã(6)</b> <br>  ‚ÄúWhere will the development of civilization and the insane thirst for power over nature and its own kind lead to?  What will be the impact of the use of new technologies and the creation of increasingly destructive types of weapons? <br>  And what if, in the future, the inhabitants of the earth have to start all over again?  Who will be responsible for the fate of the world? " <br>  Epic science fiction novel. </li><li>  <b>"Star of CEC" A.R.</b>  <b>Belyaev (1)</b> <br>  Just an interesting story, a flight into space.  Something is even described on the projects of the scientist Tsiolkovsky. <br>  He also has other interesting novels. </li><li>  <b>"Roadside Picnic" Arkady and Boris Strugatsky.</b> <br>  The book at the time left an indelible impression and shook its atmospheric.  There was so much interesting and inexplicable in it that it was just not clear how it was possible to describe all this using standard words and sentences.  I consider them the best authors among Soviet science fiction writers.  That is why became a fan of the game "STALKER".  Despite the fact that only the ‚Äúartifacts‚Äù and the ‚ÄúZone‚Äù itself are connected with the original storyline of the book, that atmosphere of the book is conveyed.  And this is the most important thing in my opinion. </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúThe End of the Rainbow‚Äù by Vernor Vinge</b> <br>  Vernor Vinge is a big fan of technological innovations, all these multimedia projects, fast learning techniques, virtual libraries, artificial intelligence ... His characters look among these digital wonders like children on a playground.  But the playground is sometimes overshadowed; the social and psychological dilemmas temporarily resolved in this book will not disappear anywhere.  Vinge is trying to hint that a good and carefree life in 2025 does not mean the same ten years later. <br>  Many admirers of Vinge's work expected a cosmic epic in the spirit of ‚ÄúFlame over the Abyss‚Äù and ‚ÄúDepths in the Sky‚Äù from him - but they got something completely different.  However, this does not mean that the new book of the writer is inferior to his previous dilogy.  "The end of the rainbow," Vinge proves that he can keep the bar of quality, and not going to a distant future and distant space. </li><li>  <b>Star Kings Edmond Hamilton</b> <br>  American writer, one of the ‚Äúfounding fathers‚Äù - along with D. Williamson and E. ‚ÄúDoc‚Äù Smith - modern US science fiction, one of the early popularizers and leaders of the so-called space opera.  Among his most famous books is the popular novel, whose name has become synonymous with reckless, dynamic and plot-rich "space opera" - "Star Kings";  continue: - the collection "Return to the Stars." <br></li></ul><br><h4>  Fantasy. </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>"Hyperion" Dan Simmons</b> <br>  Awesome space saga (in a cycle of 4 books). <br>  More fascinating, I never read. </li><li>  <b>"Terror" Dan Simmons</b> </li><li>  <b>"The World of Spiders" by Colin Wilson</b> <br>  No one knew why spiders hate people so much ... </li><li>  <b>Ants (trilogy) by Bernard Werber</b> <br>  Definitely a masterpiece.  The main characters are ants and people.  The world of insects is described in such detail - castes, duties, etc., that it becomes uncommon - we are not the only developed civilization on this planet.  I strongly recommend reading. <br>  <a href="http://aboutwerber.com/pro/ants.htm">Ants</a> , <a href="http://aboutwerber.com/pro/dayofants.htm">Ant Day</a> , <a href="http://aboutwerber.com/pro/revolofants.htm">Revolution Ants</a> </li><li>  <b>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy Douglas Adams (31)</b> <br>  You still do not know why a towel?  And where is the best gryzloder provided in the universe? <br>  One of the best examples of humorous fiction.  Only gourmets say that there are good translations and not so much, and snobs say that in general only the original should be read. </li><li>  <b>"The Night in Dreary October" by Roger Zelazny (7)</b> <br>  An excellent novel in the spirit of the Victorian classics from the face of the watchdog.  It tells about a mysterious Game, in which various heroes gathered on the eve of all saints: here Frankenstein, Dracula, Sherlock Holmes and even Cthulhu :) And this is not cheap postmodernism, but a very harmonious piece. </li><li>  <b>"Astrovityanka" Nik Bitter (7)</b> <br>  Good teenage fiction.  A simple but interesting plot is replete with popular science interspersed, so it‚Äôs interesting not only for children :) Yes, and from an emotional point of view, in my opinion, it touches much more Harry Potters. <br>  The first book is completely legal to download from librusek, the second - ‚ÄúThe Theory of Catastrophe‚Äù will appear some time later, when the paper circulation will be sold out. </li><li>  <b>"World River" Philip Jose Farmer (4)</b> <br>  The world of the river is a collection of books, or rather, it is an IDEA created by Farmer according to which many authors wrote works (the framework can be said :). <br>  The idea is that some creatures invented a machine that could create human bodies and place the souls of the dead in them (roughly speaking, the resurrection).  After death, people found themselves on a strange planet, at the bed of an endless river.  All the bodies of the resurrected people were young (20-30 years old) and did not grow old, there were no animals on the planet.  People received food from the mysterious, huge pillars that stood throughout the river. <br>  And different works tell about different events on this planet (there are tens of billions of people there). <br>  Someone tried to rebuild a civilization, someone struggled with the barbarians, someone hit philosophy / science / technology, and someone decided to find out what creatures created this new world and went to the headwaters of the river in the hope of finding them. </li><li>  <b>"Tiered World" by Philip Jos√© Farmer</b> </li><li>  <b>"We rolled your sun" Yevgeny Lukin</b> <br>  Lukin is a wonderful writer, with a great sense of humor, beautifully stylizing every detail of the worlds invented by him.  I advise you to read everything at all, including poetry, and ‚ÄúThe Sun‚Äù is as if I selected one piece for a series. </li><li>  <b>Harry Harrison's ‚ÄúFantastic Saga‚Äù (6)</b> </li><li>  <b>"Roy" Michael Crichton (1)</b> <br>  Quite an exciting novel about multi-agent systems, with the main character - a programmer, who in the course of the novel tells some useful principles in designing these very systems, but the work is not about programming. </li><li>  <b>"Oh Brave New World" by Aldous Huxley</b> <br>  Dystopia.  A very strong attempt to present the development of human society in the future ... Partly in the present. </li><li>  <b>"Monday begins on Saturday" Strugatsky brothers</b> </li><li>  <b>"Chronicles of the Black Squad" Glen Cook</b> </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúThe City of the Doomed‚Äù Arkady and Boris Strugatsky</b> </li><li>  <b>"Foundation" Isaac Asimov (4)</b> <br>  Asimov is my favorite science fiction, my acquaintance began with this trilogy, and after that I read all his works that I find on sale.  The book is about the collapse of the galactic empire and its long-term revival.  I consider it necessary to read by all lovers of science fiction. </li><li>  <b>"Labyrinth of reflection" Sergey Lukyanenko (4)</b> <br>  I think this book is an example of excellent Russian fiction.  It tells about a virtual city, life in it and how this life is addictive. </li><li>  <b>Star Butterfly by Bernard Werber (5)</b> <br>  Quite an interesting plot, in the style of Werber, who likes to write about utopias.  Unexpected outcome. </li><li>  <b>Wirth Jeff Noon (5)</b> </li><li>  <b>"Pollen" by Jeff Noon (5)</b> </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúNymphomation‚Äù by Jeff Noon (5)</b> <br>  All books form a trilogy in which two worlds are described - real and virtual (which can be reached under the influence of narcotic feathers).  Read on mood, because sometimes it can be read easily, and sometimes not.  In any case, I advise everyone.  Because everything is very unusual.  =) </li><li>  <b>"The Chronicles of the Dune" F. Herbert</b> <br>  Books create a very interesting world with their political and environmental issues. </li><li>  <b>"Stranger in a strange land" Robert Heinlein</b> </li><li>  <b>"Ender's Game" by Orson Scott Card</b> </li><li>  <b>"War of the Worlds" HG Wells (2)</b> </li><li>  <b>"Time Machine" HG Wells (2)</b> </li><li>  <b>"The Invisible Man" by HG Wells (2)</b> </li><li>  <b>"The first people on the moon" HG Wells (2)</b> </li><li>  <b>"War in the Air" HG Wells (2)</b> </li><li>  <b>"Mysterious Island" Jules Verne</b> </li><li>  <b>"Journey to the Center of the Earth" Jules Verne</b> </li><li>  <b>"Captain Nemo" Jules Verne</b> </li><li>  <b>A Space Odyssey by Arthur Clark</b> </li><li>  <b>"Neuromantic" William Gibson (7)</b> <br>  Classic cyberpunk from one of the founders of the genre.  A cult thing among IT professionals around the world.  Great atmosphere of the high-tech industrial world of the future.  It is read in one breath, but does not let go for a very long time.  It has a number of sequels.  And, by the way, the film version of this work will be released soon.  ‚ÄúThe sky above the port was the color of the TV screen tuned to an empty channel‚Äù ... </li><li>  <b>The Green Mile by Stephen King</b> </li><li>  <b>"It" by Stephen King</b> </li><li>  <b>The Shining by Stephen King</b> </li><li>  <b>Dream Catcher Stephen King</b> </li></ul><br><h4>  Drama. </h4><br><ul><li>  <b>"Collector" John Fowles (9)</b> <br>  Roman plot is close to the "perfumer" Suskind.  The guy caught the girl like a butterfly.  A very impressive comparison of the behavior of the maniac from the point of view of himself and the victim, the girl who fell into the trap, someone's lover, sweet, intelligent, kind, which in turn is compared with the butterfly.  The book is difficult for perception (however, as the "perfumer"), but it is worth reading. </li><li>  <b>"On the needle" Irwin Welch (2)</b> <br>  If you thought that everything was bad for you, read any of his works, then you will understand that everything is not so bad.  The author of this book himself has seen a lot in his life, and as I understand the majority, he wrote the real facts.  In general, it is a pleasure to read, I recommend =) </li><li>  <b>"1984" George Orwell (27)</b> <br>   (),   1949 .     1984   ,    .  ,  .  2009    The Times,  ,    60 .     ¬´ ¬ª   . </li><li> <b>¬´ ¬ª  </b> <br>  :  , ,      ,         . <br> ,   ,        ¬´¬ª   ,  ,   </li></ul><br><h4>  . . </h4><br><ul><li> <b>¬´¬ª  (1)</b> <br>  -,    . ,    ,  .     -      (,     ),      .       ,       (  ,  , ,  , ,  , ,  ).    ! </li><li> <b>¬´12 ¬ª ., .(18)</b> <br> , ,      ;          . </li><li> <b>¬´ ¬ª ., .</b> <br>       (¬´  ¬ª, ¬´ ¬ª, ¬´, ¬ª, ¬´   ¬ª, ¬´ , ¬ª),       ,     .   ,       :) </li><li> <b>¬´ ¬ª  </b> <br>         ,      .  ,  ,   ‚Äî      -. </li><li> <b>¬´¬ª  </b> <br>       ,  ‚Äî ,   ,      .   ‚Äî     . <br>               .           ,    .  -        ‚Äî   :     ‚Äî    . ,  ,    ,    ,       ,     ,     . </li><li> <b>¬´-¬ª  </b> <br>          (, ,  ¬´  III¬ª  ¬´ ¬ª). <br>       .   ¬´-¬ª ‚Äî    ,  ¬´  ¬ª.    .  ,      .    .            .    ‚Äî  . </li><li> <b>¬´    ¬ª  </b> </li></ul><br><h4> . </h4><br><ul><li> <b>¬´¬ª  (4)</b> <br>   ,       .     ‚Äî  ,   ‚Äî ,        ¬´  ¬ª (  11),     (     ).      ,    . , , ,   ‚Äî     .    ,    .   . </li><li> <b>¬´ ¬ª  </b> <br>     La mystice de Moscow,   .    ‚Äî     ,         .   ,   ‚Äî .       .     ,      -        .   ,        ,  ,  .     ‚Äî     </li><li> <b>¬´ ¬ª  </b> </li><li> <b>¬´ -¬ª  </b> </li><li> <b>¬´ ¬ª  </b> </li></ul><br><h4>     . </h4><br><ul><li> <b>¬´ ¬ª  (4)</b> <br>        . </li><li> <b>¬´  ¬ª  (6)</b> </li><li> <b>¬´¬ª   (3)</b> <br>  , ,    ,  ,  ,    . <br>   ,   ,        . <br> ,   . </li><li> <b>¬´-2.¬ª   </b> </li><li> <b>¬´ ¬ª  (2)</b> <br>  . , - ,         ¬´28  ¬ª. </li><li> <b>¬´ ¬ª  (2)</b> <br>    .   ,   ,  ¬´ ¬ª,      . </li><li> <b>¬´ ¬ª  (2)</b> <br>     .    ‚Äî      . </li></ul><br><h4> . </h4><br><ul><li> <b>¬´ ¬ª  (23)</b> <br>  Classic.    ,   ,      .        . </li><li> <b>¬´   ¬ª  (7)</b> <br>    ,        :) <br>      ‚Äî  ,     ,   . , ,    ‚Äî    ,         . <br>  ,       .
