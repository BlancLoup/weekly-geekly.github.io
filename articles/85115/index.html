      The point is simple - the seller did not take care of the safety of transportation.  Of course, thin plastic tanks with paint could not stand the shots of the parcel against the walls of the containers :-) At least it was necessary to pack more goods in the box and with foam plastic. <br>  Wearing rubber gloves, 10 minutes washed all this miracle.  It became clear (see the slideshow) that the container with the blue paint cracked, flooded everything surrounding it, and the fixings of the cartridges broke.  Of course, the chips were soaked in paint, and later on by me during the laundering process (what difference does it make?). <br><br>  After finishing the photo session and laundering, without thinking twice, he went to the computer in order to unsubscribe the seller as soon as possible. <br><br><h6>  Letter number one: </h6><br><blockquote>  Hey, pal! <br>  Have you heard about foam and safe packaging?  Is it possible to pack inks for international shipping that kind? <br>  You have had a broken package. <br>  I've made a lot of job to find out, what happens?  the whole bathroom was in blue ink!  It is not usefull at all. <br>  You can look at this by yourself: <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/41124656" rel="nofollow">www.flickr.com/photos/41124656@N07/sets/72157623341837551/</a> <br>  If you want I can upload a video to YouTube. <br><br>  2 weeks of waiting were all for nothing. <br><br>  Please send me a dispute in a couple of days. </blockquote><br><br><h6>  Answer number one: </h6><br><blockquote>  I don‚Äôt have problems like this shipping international.  Looks like USPS damaged it pretty good.  It would be a good order.  Let me know what address </blockquote><br><br><h6>  Letter number two: </h6><br><blockquote>  Item was broken during transportation.  Because the whole system is unusable?  spoiled with blue ink.  Cartridges are spoiled with ink. <br>  It's not the USPS, because if it had been packed it would have been packed. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Of course, he doesn‚Äôt want to be placed on another delivery system, but what can you do, since you don‚Äôt know how to pack, be kind, sell off. <br>  After reading the answer, I immediately filed a lawsuit at the <b>PayPal Resolution Center</b> , and all sellers are afraid of this thing, especially the venerable ones, since <b>PayPal</b> can cover up their entire business.  Judging by the first letter, it‚Äôs normal that there is a response in the form of a possible excuse, because not everyone dares to file a lawsuit in the <b>Resolution Center</b> or at least knows about its existence.  My wife and I have already eaten the dog, suing the Chinese for <i>$ 600</i> for two wedding dresses, which the customs did not want to miss due to their fault (invoice for <i>$ 50</i> with the word <i>‚ÄúSample‚Äù</i> via <a href="http://dhl.ru/" rel="nofollow">DHL</a> ). <br><br>  Application screenshot: <br><img src="http://cuamckuy.ru/uploads/images/2010/02/21/image-2010-02-21-v-17.21.19.png" width="487" height="354"><br><br><br><h6>  Answer number two: </h6><br><blockquote>  HI, sorry to see that for you.  I want you to get better and wrap better. <br>  Thanks <br>  Devin <br></blockquote><br><br>  In total, within a few days, he will send me the same <a href="http://emspost.ru/" rel="nofollow">EMS</a> at his own expense with the same <a href="http://emspost.ru/" rel="nofollow">EMS</a> , and the old one will remain inoperative, but with 5 full tanks of 200 ml paint each time it will be useful. <br><br>  Do not be afraid to defend your rights - the buyer is always right.  Enjoy the shopping. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85115/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85115/</a></p>
