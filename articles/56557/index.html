  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Felix Muchnik: "The client must be satisfied"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  General Director of <a href="http://www.softkey.ru/">Softkey</a> Felix Muchnik delivered a lecture for students of the specialization <a href="http://rma.ru/internet">‚ÄúManagement in the field of Internet technologies‚Äù</a> .  The director of the first in Russia electronic store of licensed software raised the issues of organizing his business on the Internet. <br><br>  At the beginning of the lesson, Felix Muchnik described the factors that, in his opinion, are decisive for the successful implementation of business ideas, and then shared the main secret - what needs to be done to make the project a ‚Äúshot‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  ‚ÄúBy and large, it's all the same what to sell and what business to do.  The main thing is for you to be really interested.  If you are not passionate about the idea and do not see how it will live during the coming years, you need to leave and try to realize yourself in something else, ‚ÄùFelix Muchnik said.  Among the most important conditions, the fulfillment of which is necessary to turn a startup into a successful business, were also mentioned the factor of the team that works on the project, and the degree of its motivation in terms of the company's development.  ‚ÄúThe most important thing is the people who walk beside you.  One man show does not work here - at least for a company that is designed for a long-term existence.  I strongly advise you not to start your business without a team of at least five people.  At the same time, it is important that an evangelist be present in the company who will teach people and increase their faith in the business idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project.  It should also be understood that at a certain stage of development, people in the company will have to be recruited from the street, therefore you will initially need to organize a technological process so that any boy or girl who has come to you can work with invoices within a week.  That is, your technology must be self-organizing. ‚Äù

      The goal of any online business, according to Softkey‚Äôs director, is to meet the needs of the client.  ‚ÄúThe most important thing is that the client is satisfied, because the Internet is a place where the client is loyal and returns to you again and again.‚Äù <br><br>  The second part of the lecture, Felix Muchnik made, by his definition, ‚Äúdialogue‚Äù and began to answer questions from the audience. <br><br>  <b>- What ideas seem to you the most promising in terms of implementation in business?</b> <br>  - If I knew where to go, I myself would move in that direction.  However, we have promising projects that we are going to develop.  In general, it is easier for me to say in which direction you should not move.  I do not recommend using ideas that imply getting money only on the advertising model.  I also do not advise developing social networks. <br><br>  <b>- How to choose a security service that can protect a company from a tax audit?</b> <br>  - Do not be afraid - you need to know your rights and not violate the law.  If everything is okay with you, then you will not have to be afraid of checks.  White business is simple to build - I can say this with all the responsibility.  We conduct such a policy from the very beginning and are very pleased with this. <br><br>  <b>- Tell us about the differences in the state of the Internet in Russia and in the West ...</b> <br>  - Let's talk about two years ago.  The Western Internet is one wave ahead.  As long as the second wave ends and the third one begins, the third one already ends.  On the fourth, the multiplatform wave of general mobilization begins when you are always in some kind of environment, always inside;  this wave is already beginning in the West.  In some ways we duplicate them, and in some ways we are different.  A typical mistake of our geeks of the first wave is the creation of the Runet.  We separated ourselves from everyone, but the money is there ... So you need to understand that there are other markets, and that they are at different levels. <br><br>  <b>- How many people work in the company Softkey?</b> <br>  - Last year, the number of employees did not change, but significantly increased in the year before last - from 50 to 140 people. <br><br>  <b>- What allowed Softkey to become one of the leaders of its market segment?</b> <br>  - Automation is very important for online projects.  Someone thought about this before, someone later.  In fact, automated control systems in our country are not particularly used now.  Especially for business, because computers often continue to be used as typewriters.  Few people thought about the need to create a system for its automation when the business was not yet existing.  Our competitors started this process not so long ago.  We have invested an insane amount of money in automation since the company was founded.  Our second advantage is electronic delivery.  When we announced it, many people thought that, for example, an electronic version was not enough for an accountant and delivered the software in boxes.  In the end, this became our clear advantage, because no one did that.  And our main advantage is that we always think about what we are doing.  We analyze business all the time and devote 8 hours of our time to this, and some of us even 24. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56557/</a></p>
