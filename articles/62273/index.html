      <b>1. The most important phobia and fear of the seller and the father of the founder</b> <br>  I think I will not be mistaken if I say that this is licensed software and everything connected with it. <br>  But what always amazed me was the fact that people put a licensed Windows in their company and thought that they caught God by the beard and protected themselves from all mischief in their hats and even masks.  And the fact that the computer is teeming with other pirate software from WinRar to CorelDraw, as if it didn't matter at all.  When they check you, they will look at everything, not just Windows. <br><br>  By the way, consider that when buying a Windows, you must have receipt documents for it, because the sticker itself does not indicate its legality - an expenditure invoice is needed. <br><br>  But there is a recipe how to protect a computer company from all this.  Borg has a program for partners Microsoft Action Pack <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/Ukraine/program/managemembership/actionpack">Microsoft Action Pack</a> <br>  The essence is approximately as follows: <br>  1. You become a small-scale partner - this requires simple registration. <br>  2. Then you will need to take the children's test online. <br>  3. After that, pay the account $ 350.  At the moment, I don‚Äôt know the exact amount, but not more than that. <br>  4. And now for 12 months you will be sent a package with all products from Microsoft: Windows 7, Server 2008, MS Office, etc. <br><br>  It contains about 10 licenses for each individual product.  That is, for a small firm fit completely.  You will get a legitimate license software.  And you can not be afraid of anyone. <br>  And once again I repeat, the price of this good is 350 a year.  Although in the first year, robots can not worry - you are unlikely to be interested in any kind of verification.  And already when you unwind, you can afford this pleasure. <br><br>  But this option is only for firms selling computers - otherwise it is not suitable. <br><br>  Another option: Linux.  But this is if you yourself understand it.  And taking an individual person for this business will be more detrimental to your pocket than paying three hundred greens a year. <br><br>  The rest of the software to use either free or Portable version, which shaft in the internet.  I had portables Photoshop, Corel, 1C, TC - and that‚Äôs all. <br><br>  And then you will not have to pray at night and go to church every time our government decides to pick up for the next elections with the help of its organs. <br><br>  <b>2. Money, Money</b> <br>  A lot of people asked about money - so I will try to describe in general terms.  But this is not a recipe for action and no methodology for winning the market is just my personal experience. <br><br>  Since our trick is that we are not mowing the loot instantly, but are looking for long-term prospects, you must be a patient and moderate person in your needs.  At least for a certain period of time.  You should not immediately show ambition and buy leather furniture, expensive mobile phones, renting an office in the elite business center. <br><br>  Some will want to take a loan.  Now I will not go into details of lending, because at the moment it is not relevant.  The only thing to remember is that you know about it even as drunk as an insole: never take a loan under the ‚Äúannuity‚Äù scheme!  Despite the fact that the annuity seems more profitable and obvious - you only need to take the standard or not to take it at all. <br><br>  So, the money.  Where to get?  There is one simple trick that you can competently use. <br>  Beginners, be sure that after 1-2 months of work with a supplier on an advance payment, you will be given a credit line for 14 days.  That is, if you took the goods for 500 bucks on the 1st of June, then ‚Äúby paper‚Äù until June 14, your debt will be 0 ye.  And on June 15, it will already be 500th.  Anyone who knows how to count even a drop, he immediately realizes that this is actually an interest-free loan at someone else's expense.  You just need to be sure of your turnover. <br><br>  For example, after the first year of life, your company has a turnover of 3 thousand.  yeah a month.  This means that you can safely spend 1500 ye ‚Äúleft‚Äù, and better for the promotion of the company.  And while the turnover is growing, you can actually spend 50% of the turnover on yourself.  Although it is desirable not to exceed the threshold of 30% - then you will not even have any questions from any of the suppliers.  But forbid Allah to slow down - debts will immediately climb and then it will become bad. <br>  This information will be useful only to doubting newbies, because people already working in the trade cut through this chip pretty quickly, although some slow down.  Just be sure that with proper calculation and perseverance, you will have working capital - the main thing is to use it correctly. <br><br>  <b>3. Dumping</b> <br>  Often, "newbies" start dumping - partly right.  This strategy will attract more customers.  But when buying, they must feel that you are good not only by price.  Everyone who came to you for a low price should be ‚Äúseduced‚Äù.  Although dumping should be with a lot of advertising, that is ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù - otherwise you will have few sales and even less earnings.  And this is fraught with consequences. <br>  After a few months, a gradual rise in prices begins - with some of the customers eliminated.  Although, believe me, low price seekers are not your friends.  They are traitors in the trading spaces. <br><br>  But in no case can not overdo it with dumping.  The fact is that with such a policy, the turnover may sharply increase.  A high turnover, as mentioned above, will give you the opportunity to spend this negotiable money quietly and with impunity.  Such a state of affairs is relaxing for many - it seems that things are going up, the turnover is growing, but in fact you will actually work in the negative.  And each computer sold in the future increases your cost of ensuring the work of the service department. <br><br>  Many understand the dangers of growing traffic and low prices too late.  I myself witnessed the collapse of 2 firms, which in 2 years passed through the stages of rapid growth, prosperity and sharp withering, and bankruptcy. <br>  Although spending a part of working capital wisely, and then raising prices, you can still greatly improve your business. <br><br>  <b>4. Cash register</b> <br>  Well, this is just a tip.  In parallel with the company, be sure to open an entrepreneur on a single tax. <br>  Then the cash register is not needed and much less problems will be with the accounting of your company, which also will not have to keep cash.  Although entrepreneurs wrote a lot on Habr√©.  The main thing to remember is to issue an entrepreneur.  It makes life easier. <br><br>  <b>5. Accounting</b> <br>  For emergency you will need an accountant.  But there is a moment: all accountants like to whine, what a difficult job they have and what they need to help is a senior boo who will help with quarterly reports.  I, too, in my time did this, until I got to the bottom of everything. <br><br>  It is just that they are languid from the monotony of work and want to embellish their existence with a lot of importance and difficulty.  Nifiga difficult there.  Bukh surely demand ability to hand over quarterly reports.  If you can not let them learn - there is nothing complicated there: you just need to maintain accounting normally and be able to count. <br>  Of course, the first year can be paid once a quarter to a ‚Äúhelper‚Äù, but if after a year your booze proves that he still cannot make a report on the MPE, income tax or retirement, drive him to the neck. <br>  At the moment of my life, I personally saw people who, thanks to the head and the Internet, could make any report after 6 months - consider.  As for this, they were not engaged in accounting.  So you pay a salary - and you demand return. <br>  All this I mean that booze on the state of emergency is very important person.  It can cause so many of your troubles and problems with the tax. <br><br>  As a matter of fact, everything is for readers.  If anyone is interested in anything else, I‚Äôll be happy to answer. <br><br>  And in the distance can be seen the notorious rake.  In essence, this will be a continuation of the past narration, although not so interesting. <br><br>  <b>Ode to human stupidity.</b> <br><br>  Although basically my stupidity was. <br>  But keep in mind that I am only re-telling that, that was and by no means teach anyone anything and do not give global advice.  Adequate people will understand right away that I was stupid and it was impossible to do so.  It took me a burn to understand what was happening.  I hope that this "experience" will be useful to someone. <br><br>  So, in order. <br><br>  In the first part I deliberately omitted some facts, since it was a question of the work of the company as such.  But it was these moments that caused the ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù. <br><br>  If you remember, the company began with two people: me and boo.  So, boo was my co-owner, and the most interesting thing is that the docks of emergency were issued to him. <br>  The fact is that at that time we did not manage to open an LLC for 2 owners in finance, and the state of emergency should have only one owner.  Since he was engaged in paperwork, it was decided to issue it. <br>  But we were friends - all the profits were 50/50, and the papers were all garbage.  Indeed, at that time we were amazing people, wore rainbow glasses and believed in justice. <br>  But in our world there is only one justice - an official document. <br><br>  By the way, in Ukraine, it is now possible to open a state of emergency for two or more owners without any mandatory financial injections.  So keep in mind. <br><br>  Problems began much later. <br><br>  In the first year of work on the buk there was no load - I did all the work, and there were almost no paper movements.  So, by the kindness of my soul, I constantly let him go, and he himself worked - after all, my eyes were burning and my soul was tearing into battle.  That is, I was engaged in: advertising, assembly, delivery, programming, customers, etc.  Not that they didn't help me at all, but the co-owner should do more than just accept incoming work. <br>  But in moments of youth, you can work around the clock, you can wake up at 8:00, and go to bed at 4 at night, and then again from the morning to fight - strength, health and fool enough for three.  And in such moments, the euphoria of what you do covers all the negative moments. <br><br>  It is this state of things that has somehow strengthened over time: I am fully engaged in the company, and he is engaged in the papers.  And then - occasionally.  Profit is 50/50.  Perhaps, if I aimed at the immediate ‚Äúwithdrawal‚Äù of a heap of money, I would immediately have sounded the alarm.  But I was still quite sweet, kind and not shot ... <br><br>  After a year and a half of such work, boo asked me to hire my brother - I was not opposed.  We were just at the time looking for an assistant.  Well, the work went further: development, increase in volumes.  More workers began to appear.  But boo worked less and less, and besides, we took the chief accountant to help him, who once a quarter helped with the reports. <br>  At certain moments of ‚Äúinsight,‚Äù I began to resent, saying that it would not hurt him to work on development, and not only on the fact of accounting work.  To which he received the answer that they say there is a brother and they are as one, and this means that the brother replaces the non-processing co-owner. <br>  At the moment, I look at those situations differently, but then it suited me.  But well, I thought, I have enough agility, energy and intelligence for two, well, let him be lazy, but we work, we earn, enough money for two - so why complain, because everything is so good.  I simply blamed my spiritual discomfort on selfishness. <br><br>  But after 5 years of work, I really began to strain the situation: I have been doing essentially everything, everything that is in the company from programs to advertising, almost everything is created by me, I have been without vacation for 4 years, we earn good money and share 50/50 profit with that who in just resting and not willing to appear at work. <br><br>  He put the question squarely and realized that I could actually do nothing.  The docks are not written to me, I can‚Äôt legally state anything, but all attempts to reach an agreement and any resolution options boiled down to the fact that you either leave yourself, because we don‚Äôt keep you, or even continue to pasha.  After all, we earn and everything is good.  But this time, I decided that the restlessness of the soul was caused by ‚Äúhealthy‚Äù selfishness. <br>  And then I decided to quit everything.  Just quit, give away.  I was still self-confident and thought that I could build a new business from scratch. <br><br>  This is the sign of 2008, which began with the fact that we were in the best shape and ready for new challenges: in fact, at the peak, I just threw the company, without taking otudova practically nothing.  It can be in the narrative form and read easily, but the procedure of this ‚Äúgap‚Äù was more than unpleasant.  Now you can guess a lot about how you can resolve the situation, but it all happened that way. <br>  Ottudov and went to the problems of the company.  Since I was engaged in everything completely, and all the clients knew exactly me, the new people who sat down in my place stopped ‚Äúsatisfying‚Äù them.  By the way, I knew some clients for 5 years, I knew their children, who graduated from school and bought a computer for them, then they grew up, graduated from the university and already bought themselves a new computer - we had very good relations with many.  Family, I would say. <br><br>  After my departure - things have deteriorated sharply.  The company moved further by inertia, but inertia in business is not eternal - there is a lot of friction in our world. <br><br>  I was ‚Äúsewn up‚Äù for 5 months. I just rested - there seemed to be enough money.  The fate of the company finally ceased to bother me after all attempts to reach an agreement resulted in nothing.  They quietly themselves coffins.  Buh actually turned out to be a peculiar person at work, he just pushed customers away from himself, behaved arrogantly and arrogantly.  The turnover fell more than twice and continued to fall.  Their fate was determined. <br><br>  I was going to do my own. <br><br>  <b>STUPID??</b>  <b>EVEN DULLER !!</b> <br><br>  Once S. King wrote: if someone deceived you, let him be ashamed, but if you were deceived a second time, then let him be ashamed of you. <br><br>  I was an idiot in the most negative sense of the word.  Having made for myself all the relevant conclusions on the business account with partners, I decided again to do something in which I am well-oriented - namely, the sale of technology. <br><br>  And here providence sends me one old friend.  I think each of you has such a "friend": he always twists something, stirs up, sells, buys, well "praises" the people to all sorts of nonsense, his thoughts are always with some tricky bias, bordering on fraud, and you he constantly wonders how he still walks smiling on the territory of our sinful state.  He then disappears, then appears and even seems to be doing some business. <br>  I do not know how, but this friend intersects with me and throws the bait on a successful business just on the topic of selling computers.  Upon reflection, I decide what to try: there is finances, experience too, and I already seem to be a ‚Äúshot‚Äù, which is worth a few untrained. <br><br>  Being supposedly ‚Äúburned out‚Äù and confident in my experience, I make clear docks, legally describe all the duties of the company and its own in it, do state of emergency for two with a clear copy of each share.  In addition, knowing about the "playful" hands of my partner, I immediately take a clear control over all finances.  We start and in the first month we immediately enter the turnover, which is equal to the fallen turnover of the company with which I left. <br>  After 2 months of work, heavenly punishment follows, for my "sins."  Karma decided that if I do not understand for good, then it is necessary to bring the brain to my mind using more and more rigid methods.  At a certain point, I understand that my partner was too unclean and the measures I took were not enough.  "Left" and irrevocably spent a lot of money, a lot. <br>  But this time I was not going to retreat.  I managed to rewrite the state of emergency, remaining the sole owner of it.  And "remove" his partner from work, well, and together with him a considerable amount of money has sunk into oblivion. <br>  And on such a merry and wild horse to the sounds of marches and fanfare to the glory of stupidity, I enter the 2008 crisis. <br><br>  And in the sum all these ill-fated coincidences draw a very sad oil painting - ‚ÄúWe arrived‚Äù. <br><br>  This is where the wondrous story actually ends.  Besides the fact that I am alive and working by the sweat of my face, in order to restore what once was.  Only this work is no longer from scratch, but thanks to the last partner, from the ‚Äúminuses‚Äù.  But as old people often say, it would be health, and there we would break through. <br><br>  <b>SMART LEARNING FOR ALIENS ERRORS</b> <br><br>  I happened to, on their own. <br>  Everyone is free to draw conclusions himself.  And can I judge something, if all my actions up to this point led me to such situations.  And this means that all the conclusions and assumptions at that time were wrong.  But let's hope that everything has changed and I have passed the lessons of life. <br><br>  The most important thing for me: it is almost impossible to build a normal business with a partner.  In such a relationship, someone will always be a victim, and someone will be a dependent.  If you fall into the role of a dependent, then in principle you can start a business.  But in the role of the victim do not want to be anyone. <br>  Talk only about small business, where everyone should put in sweat and blood. <br><br>  If we are talking about a joint venture, where you and your partner need to invest in a certain amount of money and just follow the case, then in principle, it seems to me that this is a normal situation.  Both of you will just be in control of the business. <br><br>  Many advise not to start a business with relatives.  Now I tend to believe 100%.  I imagine what will happen in such cases, even if a simple person has a lot of problems. <br><br>  Perhaps the reason for the lack of business skills and business acumen, as I mentioned last time. <br><br>        .     ,  .               .  ,   ,    ,    ,    ,  ,   ‚Äì     .    ,      ,    .      ,    -,    ,   .      .         ‚Äì    . <br><br>       .  ,        . <br><br> ,  ,   .     . <br><br>       . 2008      . 2009        ,   .  ,   .     5    .  ,             . ,   ‚Äì ,    . <br><br>  ,       .     .   ,    ,       ,     . <br><br>   .  ,     ,   ,   . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62273/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62273/</a></p>
