You, probably, know me from the <a href="https://habr.com/post/352050/"><em>‚ÄúReverse Neuromant‚Äù series</em></a> , where I talk about how we reverse-engineer and port a video game based on the novel of the same name by <em>William Gibson</em> .  Because of its content, it is rather a spin-off than the next numbering - an independent material that does not require additional preparation from the reader. </p><br><p>  It began with <a href="https://habr.com/users/viiri/" class="user_link">viiri</a> , with the words, <em>‚ÄúThis is a programmer who wrote Neuromant.</em>  <em>I think he will not mind answering the questions, ‚Äù</em> - sent me a link to the twitter account of a person named <em><strong>Troy Miles</strong></em> (in the photo).  Then I worked on the <a href="https://habr.com/post/417639/">fourth part of the</a> cycle and did not attach much importance to it.  After thinking about it a few weeks later, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan interview with a developer seemed so successful that I immediately wrote to <em>Troy</em> about who we are, what we do, and what we want from him.  The answer was not long in coming, <em>Troy</em> very favorably responded to our undertaking and agreed to answer my questions. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><hr><br><p>  <em>- Hello, Troy, I think it's time to start our little interview.</em>  <em>For starters, I want you to introduce yourself to my readers.</em>  <em>Please Troy, tell us about the highlights of your professional career.</em> </p><br><p>  - Hello everyone, my name is <strong>Troy Miles</strong> .  I have been working as a programmer since 1979, when I was still in high school.  I became the fourth employee hired at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplay_Entertainment"><strong>Interplay</strong></a> [after it was founded] in 1983.  These were great times and great guys.  I wrote <strong>Neuromanta</strong> , <strong>Lord of the Rings</strong> , and helped with the development of many other games. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w5/jh/pa/w5jhpafsf1kaoeggujzxmcwstw0.gif" hspace="5" align="left">  I left <em>Interplay</em> in 1992.  I still loved this company, but I needed a stable work schedule.  Spent some time at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenix_Technologies"><strong>Phoenix Technologies Ltd</strong></a> , working on the system software for <abbr title="Peripheral Component Microchannel Interconnect Architecture"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PC_Card"><em>PCMCIA</em></a></abbr> modules.  Somehow even wrote an <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/embedded-systems/writing-pcmcia-software/184409254">article</a> about it <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/embedded-systems/writing-pcmcia-software/184409254">in <em>Dr.</em></a>  <a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/embedded-systems/writing-pcmcia-software/184409254"><em>Dobb's magazine</em></a> . </p><br><p>  After <em>Phoenix,</em> I became an independent developer for a while.  Made a few contract games for <abbr title="Compact Disk Interactive"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philips_CD-i"><em>CDI</em></a></abbr> .  They were terrible, not in terms of programming - the gameplay was so-so, and the <em>CDI</em> itself, in principle, was not a good idea. </p><br><p>  In 2007, I joined the <strong>Kelley Blue Book</strong> , where I stay today.  Our website is www.kbb.com.  This is a resource on automotive topics.  Without too much gloss, but my colleagues are good enough. </p><br><p>  In <em>KBB</em> time, I began to write again and, if possible, hold small conferences.  So far, the reports were mainly about <em>jQuery</em> and <em>jQuery Mobile</em> .  As a result, I even wrote a <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/books/info/authors/troy-miles">book</a> on <em>jQuery</em> and made an instructional video on <em>Ionic</em> .  I also made <a href="https://www.learnnowonline.com/course/jqmc/jquery-mobile/">a <em>jQuery Mobile</em> video</a> for <em>Learn Now Online</em> . </p><br><p>  Last year, I started shooting videos for <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Troy-Miles/2324017-1.html"><em>LinkedIn Learning / Lynda.com</em></a> .  Today there are 5 of them: two in <em>C ++</em> , two in <em>Kotlin,</em> and one in <em>Bash</em> .  I plan to make some more clips in <em>C ++</em> in the near future. </p><br><p>  In my free time I am developing a mobile game.  Nothing extraordinary, ordinary kazualka, which I hope to finish in the first half of 2019.  This will be my first game since the mid-nineties <em>CDI</em> . </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Q1</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <em>- Hi Troy, I think that it‚Äôs time to start our little interview.</em>  <em>Firstly I want to introduce you to my readers.</em>  <em>Please, Troy, get us through the milestones of your professional career.</em> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  - Hi All, I am <strong>Troy Miles</strong> .  I have been a paid programmer since 1979, while I was still in high school.  I was employee number four at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplay_Entertainment"><strong>Interplay</strong></a> back in 1983. Those were great times and great guys.  I wrote <strong>Neuromancer</strong> , <strong>Lord of the Rings</strong> , and helped out on a lot of other games. <br><br>  I left <em>Interplay</em> in 1992. Still needed to work regular hours.

      In 2007, I joined the <strong>Kelley Blue Book</strong> , where I still am today.  Our site is [www.kbb.com] [www.kbb.com].  It is an automotive valuation site.  Not my glamorous mates are smart and fun. <br><br>  While here at KBB, I started writing to eventually small conferences.  For awhile most of the talks were on <em>jQuery</em> and <em>jQuery Mobile</em> .  I eventually wrote a <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/books/info/authors/troy-miles">book on</a> jonic.  I also did it on <em>jQuery Mobile</em> . <br><br>  Last year I started doing videos for <a href="https://www.lynda.com/Troy-Miles/2324017-1.html"><em>LinkedIn Learning / Lynda.com</em></a> .  So far I have 5 videos out.  Two on <em>C</em> , two on <em>Kotlin</em> , and one on <em>Bash</em> .  C ++ over the next few months. <br><br>  In my spare time, I have been designing a mobile game.  Nothing fancy, it‚Äôs a casual game, which I‚Äôm hoping to have complete with Q1 or Q2 of 2019. It‚Äôs been the era of the mid-90‚Äôs. </blockquote></div></div><br><hr><br><p>  <em>- An impressive track record!</em>  <em>But let's go back to 1983, when you first came to <strong>Inerplay</strong> .</em>  <em>Tell us how you got there and who were the great guys you mentioned?</em> </p><br><p> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f-/ad/ap/f-adapiohkqfnkavv1-b5l6d5pi.png"></a> </p><br><p>  - While in <em>San Diego</em> , about 100 kilometers from <em>Orange</em> , in <em>California</em> , I made my own games for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20"><em>Vic 20</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64"><em>C64</em></a> .  In 1983, an exhibition of computer games was held at a place called <em>Lion Country Safari [Laguna Hills, Orange]</em> .  There I met <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fargo"><strong>Brian Fargo</strong></a> .  He then worked at <em>Boone</em> , headed by a guy named <em>Michael Boone</em> (he later created <em>Boone Boards</em> ).  I spoke with <em>Boone</em> about how to get to them as a game developer, however, when the company collapsed, <em>Brian</em> called me and offered to join his startup, <em>Interplay Prouctions</em> .  I agreed.  Our first office was located in the <em>Newport Beach</em> industrial zone, right above the office of clothing manufacturer <em>Quiksilver</em> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pp/bp/j7/ppbpj7irccdagj2fx0ipu0s5jw8.jpeg" hspace="5" width="100%"><br></p><br><p>  <em>[Photo provided by Troy himself.]</em> In the photo in the front row [left to right]: <em>Alan Pavlish</em> , <em>Brian Fargo</em> , <em>I</em> , and <em>Jay Patel</em> .  Back row: <em>Bill Heinman</em> , <em>Troy Worrell</em> , and <em>Todd Camasta</em> .  This is a photograph of the end of 1984 - beginning of 1985. </p><br><p> In those days we did something under license, contract work and ports for other companies.  We even did something for the <em>Ministry of Defense</em> , through <abbr title="Loral Space &amp; Communications"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loral_Space_%2526_Communications"><em>Loral</em></a></abbr> .  This concerned <em>GPS</em> maps, which was new at the time.  For this work, we received thanks from the US Army.  We also worked on a contract with <em>the University of California</em> , <em>Irvine</em> .  They made educational games under the guidance of the professor.  We also did some action adventure for <em>Activison</em> .  Among them are <em>MindShadow</em> , <em>Tass Times in Tonetown</em> and <em>Borrowed Time</em> .  Spreading games was not easy at the time.  Finding a small computer store that would take your game for sale was not very difficult, but it took a lot of time, moreover, without a million dollars in the bank it was simply impossible to force a large distribution network, like <em>Sears</em> or <em>Walmart</em> , to sell your product.  Today it is much easier.  You can simply upload your creation to the App Store or sell it yourself through your own website.  So getting <em>Activison</em> as a publisher meant a lot and allowed us to stay afloat. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k7/ir/jb/k7irjbjjhn3o2oc4du6ubucsjja.png" hspace="5" align="left">  Around 1987, I created the coolest app that never saw the light.  It was called <em>Software Studio</em> .  The application allowed you to create something like a cartoon on the <em>C64</em> and <em>Apple II</em> .  Included was a set of prepared scenes and characters.  Each character had its own set of animations, they could walk, sit, dance and all that.  It used an incredibly efficient animation engine - just a few kilobytes you could fit a 5-minute cartoon.  At first, <em>Activision</em> became interested in the application, but later they moved away from this topic.  Then we tried to interest other players, including <em>Disney</em> .  I liked the program, but everyone feared that it was too flexible.  <em>Disney was</em> particularly worried about the misuse of its characters.  In the end, we admitted defeat and abandoned this venture. </p><br><p>  After a while, <em>Brian Fargo</em> asked me if I wanted to make a game on <em>Neuromants</em> , on a book that we both read.  The rights to the film were then, seemingly, in <em>Sabana Boys [Productions]</em> , and they were given the approval of the production.  The rights to igronizatsiyu owned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary"><strong>Tim Leary</strong></a> , but the development has stalled.  <em>Tim is</em> not a programmer, but the coders with whom he worked abandoned the project.  We went to <em>Bel-Air [Los Angeles]</em> , 60 kilometers north, to meet him at his house, but that‚Äôs another story. <br clear="left"></p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Q2</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <em>- Quite an impressive track record you have.</em>  <em>But let's get back to 1983 when you first came to the <strong>Interplay</strong> .</em>  <em>Tell us what you mentioned?</em> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  - I had <em>20</em> and <em>C64</em> in <em>San Diego,</em> roughly 100 km from <em>Orange County</em> , both in <em>California</em> .

We got a commendation from the <em>US Army</em> for our work.  It involved moving map with <em>GPS</em> , which was a new thing back then.  We also did some contract development for the <em>University of California, Irvine</em> .  We made some edutainment games under the direction of a professor.  And we did some action adventures games for <em>Activision</em> .  They were <em>MindShadow</em> , <em>Tass Times in Tonetown</em> and <em>Borrowed Time</em> , in no particular order.  Distributing games.  It was not necessary to get a lot of people.  Developers today have it much easier.  You can just upload it to your app.  So getting a solvent. <br><br>  During this time, around 1987, I created the app.  It was called <em>Software Studio</em> .  <em>C64</em> and <em>Apple II</em> .  It came with a collection of pre-built stages and characters.  Each character had a collection of animations.

Then we tried to other experts including <em>Disney</em> .  The product was too flexible.  <em>Disney was</em> especially worried about cartoons which inappropriately used their characters.  In the end, we admitted defeat and shelved it. <br><br>  Then, I asked if I was interested in <em>Neuromancer</em> .  A book we had both read.  It seemed to be the <em>Cabana Boys</em> , had it been green lighted for production.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary"><strong>The</strong></a> game had been stalled.

We went to <em>Bel-Air</em> , about 60 km to the north. </blockquote></div></div><br><hr><br><p>  <em>‚ÄúA striking story, Troy.‚Äù</em>  <em>It is a pity that <strong>Software Studio</strong> has not come out, it seems that it was a serious breakthrough.</em>  <em>In childhood I used similar software.</em>  <em>I don‚Äôt remember the name, something like <strong>The Simpsons: Cartoon Studio</strong> , but on Soviet cartoons.</em>  <em>But it was in the two thousandths, and you did it 15 years ago.</em>  <em>Impressive.</em> </p><br><p>  <em>But back to business.</em>  <em>The next question should have been about how <strong>Interplay</strong> came to <strong>Neuromant</strong> , but you already answered it :).</em>  <em>But before we start talking about the game itself, I have a couple of questions, the answers to which are interesting to me personally.</em>  <em>That's what's the matter, <strong>Timothy Leary</strong> is undoubtedly an outstanding person, so what was it like working with him?</em> </p><br><p>  <em>And another question, did <strong>William Gibson</strong> himself take part in the development?</em> </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Who is Timothy Leary?</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/od/iv/28/odiv287knb7bgerru09ejg1tpgk.jpeg" width="40%" height="40%" align="left">  <strong>Timothy Francis Leary</strong> (10/22/1920 - 05/31/1996) - American writer, psychologist, participant in a campaign for psychedelic drugs research, software developer. </p><br><p>  In twenty years, <em>Leary</em> became a student at the <em>University of Alabama</em> , and at the end received a <em>bachelor</em> 's degree <em>in psychology</em> .  In 1950 he became a <em>doctor of psychology</em> .  In 1957 he created the psychodiagnostic method <em>‚ÄúLeary interpersonal relationship test‚Äù</em> , which is still used by the US special services. </p><br><p>  <em>Leary</em> got his scandalous fame for studying the effect of psychedelics on the human psyche and nervous system.  Leary actively promoted psychedelics, gave lectures and wrote a number of books on expanding the boundaries of human consciousness. <br clear="left"></p><br><p>  This scandalous glory of Leary led to the silence of his merits in those areas of psychology, which later became associated with completely different names. </p><br><p>  In 1984, <em>Leary</em> joined the cyberpunk movement, which in those years captured America.  He and in that environment managed to become a leader, gathering around him dissatisfied with the reality of people.  Together with <em>William Gibson, the</em> scientist promoted the reunification of man and computer, created several software products, wrote a number of books. </p><br><p>  The scientist died in the 1996th year.  The moment of his death, he recorded on the video, which was connected to the Internet.  So, everyone could watch his death.  The last thing he said was: <em>"Why not?"</em> </p><br><hr></div></div><br><p>  - Working with <em>Tim Leary</em> was very cool.  He was really cool.  <em>Tim</em> invited us to his house to discuss the project.  We settled in his living room, from where there was just a stunning view of Los Angeles.  After a few cans of beer, we told him about our vision of the game, which was very different from his vision.  We were not sure about how he would react, but he liked the idea, and it seemed that he was extremely interested in us putting this into reality. </p><br><p>  Amusingly, <em>Tim</em> , sort of, <em>‚Äúgrunted‚Äù</em> on how active I was.  It seemed that he had never met an extravert computer programmer before.  He asked if I was not an actor, I was not, but he just wanted me to star in the film.  Then it seemed possible, but, alas, it never came to that.  So I missed my chance to become a movie star ;-). </p><br><p>  <em>William Gibson</em> did not participate in the development of the game.  Although we met once in <em>Santa Monica</em> , during his autograph session.  I only had about two minutes to talk to him.  We invited him to drink with us after the session, but he already had plans.  It seems that he is a cool guy, and I really appreciate that, despite the fact that he was busy, he had a couple of minutes to chat with us. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Q3</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <em>- Such a stunning story, Troy.</em>  <em>It is a serious breakthrough.</em>  <em>I was a kid.</em>  <em>It was something like the <strong>Simpsons: Cartoon Cartoons,</strong> but it can't remember how it called.</em>  <em>But it was in the 2000s, and you already did it 15 years ago.</em>  <em>So impressive.</em> <br><br>  <em>But let's get back to our business.</em>  <em>It <strong>‚Äôs not a problem</strong> , but you‚Äôve already answered it :)</em>  <em>It is a notable man.</em> <br><br>  <em><strong>William Gibson</strong> didn‚Äôt take part in it?</em> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <em>- Tim Leary</em> was super cool to work with.

He was the link that held us together.  Very clever and friendly, he was for us something like a mentor.  The main screenwriter was <em>Michael Stakpol</em> .  Then he was a rising star, and now - the famous author of science fiction.  <em>Charles Wademan III</em> was our magnificent artist.  He used the tools I had crafted to create the interface, the characters, and their animations.  And finally, <em>Brian Fargo</em> , the head of <em>Interplay</em> , served as executive producer and was very involved in the process of creating the game. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-8/bj/an/-8bjanh8hkmokv61vgu_xysnw40.png"><br></p><br><p>  <em>[Photos found on the Internet.</em>  <em>From left to right: Michael Stakpol, Todd Camasta, Bill Heinman, Troy Miles, Bruce Belfort, Charles Wademan III.]</em> </p><br><p>  In total, the game took about 9-10 months.  It was stressful, but fun.  The coolest thing was how openly and honestly we could talk to each other without taking criticism at our own expense.  This allowed us to squeeze the most out of each other, which made the game only better. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9b/b8/6t/9bb86tnctk1zxi2okhkjhr_-2wo.jpeg" hspace="5"><br></p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Q4</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <em>- Just wondering if <strong>Gibson</strong> played the game.</em>  <em>As far as i know</em> <br><br>  <em>So, the <strong>"Neuromancer"</strong> .</em>  <em>For now we‚Äôre about to be on the whole Neuromancer team.</em>  <em>Who else worked on the game?</em>  <em>What was the roles?</em> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  - <em>Gibson</em> never played the game. <br><br>  <em>Bruce Balfour</em>  He was the glue that kept us together.

Get the best out of each other. </blockquote></div></div><br><hr><br><p>  <em>- The important point is that the game was released on a certain set of platforms, so when you talk about how much time was spent on <strong>Neuromant</strong> , do you mean some specific version (if so, which one), or all at once?</em>  <em>I ask because, for example, the <strong>Amiga</strong> version [left], compared to the <strong>MS-DOS</strong> version [middle], looks like a completely different game, not to mention the <strong>C64</strong> version [right].</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1n/vh/kf/1nvhkfnsjxhra_k5mqh4l15vk0m.png" hspace="5"><br></p><br><p>  - I am only talking about the <em>C64</em> .  Ports made other people.  <em>The C64</em> was the coolest car for its money, with a great sound and video chip.  <em>The 6502nd processor was</em> also an interesting thing.  Due to its simplicity, it allowed to do things that did not allow more powerful processors, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-modifying_code"><em>self-modifying code</em></a> .  Such frills forced to sweat those who made the ports.  The game was entirely written in <em>6502-m Assembler</em> . </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Q5</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <em>- This is an important point.</em>  <em><strong>Neuromancer</strong> , when you‚Äôre talking to you?</em>  <em><strong>Amiga</strong> [left] version compared with <strong>MS-DOS</strong> [center] version, for example, it looks like it‚Äôs a different game.</em> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  - I am only talking about the <em>C64</em> .  The ports were done by others.  The C64 was an amazing machine for the price.  It also had excellent sound and video chips.  The <em>6502 processor</em> was also an interesting beast.  CPUs couldn‚Äôt be like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-modifying_code"><em>self-modifying</em></a> code.  This kind of tricks gave some of the port writers the blues.  The entire game was written in 6502 assembly. </blockquote></div></div><br><hr><br><p>  <em>- That's cool!</em>  <em>Making our port, we assumed that the game was written in Assembler, but did not think that it was originally <strong>6502nd</strong> .</em>  <em>By the way, about the tricks, maybe you remember and describe a few more?</em> </p><br><p>  - Right now, three interesting techniques come to my mind: <em><strong>blasting</strong></em> , <em><strong>interrupts</strong></em> , and <em><strong>self-modifying code</strong></em> . </p><br><p> <em><strong>Blasting</strong></em>  The <em>C64</em> could have several visible screens, and it was possible to choose which of them is active by simply setting a specific value.  Using the screen means: <em>clearing it</em> , <em>drawing it</em> , and <em>setting the bit</em> in order to display the result.  Obviously, you need the fastest way to clear the screen.  And the fastest was the installation of the battery at zero and the sequential recording of the battery value in <em><strong>each</strong></em> memory cell of the screen.  <em>[Troy literally means <strong>explicit</strong> entry in each cell: <code>mov ax, 0; mov screen[0], ax; mov screen[1], ax ... mov screen[n], ax</code></em> <em><code>mov ax, 0; mov screen[0], ax; mov screen[1], ax ... mov screen[n], ax</code></em>  <em><code>mov ax, 0; mov screen[0], ax; mov screen[1], ax ... mov screen[n], ax</code> .]</em> It looks crazy, and, as a programmer, you want to wrap it in a <em>for</em> loop, but branching critically slows down the execution of code. </p><br><p>  <em><strong>Interrupts</strong></em>  Video interception in <em>C64</em> started every 30th of a second.  It was possible to intercept this interruption and get something like "multitasking for the poor."  Whatever you do there - it must be fast, otherwise the picture will twitch.  But you could have time to do all sorts of useful things, like sound control or multiplexing sprites. </p><br><p>  <em><strong>Self-modifying code</strong></em> .  <em>The 6502nd</em> knew how to do one very strange thing - to change the instruction before it was executed.  It sounds crazy, but the idea is simple: instead of checking the condition and moving to the next branch of the code, leave one branch and just change its code depending on the condition. </p><br><pre> <code class="hljs pgsql">repeat N times { <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span></span> STATE <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">is</span></span> <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">1</span></span> increase A <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">by</span></span> one <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">else</span></span> decrease A <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">by</span></span> one <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span></span> something <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span></span> A } repeat N times { increase A <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">by</span></span> one <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">do</span></span> something <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span></span> A <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">when</span></span> STATE has <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">to</span></span> switch { replace the opcode "increase" above <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">with</span></span> the opcode <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">to</span></span> decrease, <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">or</span></span> vice versa } }</code> </pre> <br><p>  By the way, at first the <em>PC</em> architecture was extremely poorly suited for gaming.  The trouble with the sound, a very simple graphics subsystem, and let's not remember the <em>640K</em> memory <em>limit</em> .  Most <em>PCs</em> were then <em>8088</em> , and they are much slower than their <em>8086</em> brethren.  So, more memory and a better processor did not make <em>PCs a</em> better development environment. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Q6</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <em>- Amazing!</em>  <em>It was <strong>6502</strong> .</em>  <em>Whats up?</em> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  I can think of it right now: <em><strong>blasting</strong></em> , <em><strong>interrupts</strong></em> , and <em><strong>self-modifying code</strong></em> . <br><br>  <em><strong>Blast</strong></em> - <em>C64</em> can be customized.  Flip up a <em>bit</em> to show it.  Clearly as possible.  The accumulator is in the memory of the accumulator.  It is a coder.  But the act of the branch dramatically slows the code down. <br><br>  <em><strong>Interrupts</strong></em> - the <em>C64</em> has a video interrupt every 30th of a second.

It is a simple way to find out how to use it. <br><br>  A side note - it was a terrible gaming environment.  The sound of the PC was not included.

So even though the CPU was better. </blockquote></div></div><br><hr><br><p>  <em>- Indeed, the <strong>PC version</strong> looks and sounds poorly.</em>  <em>However, here is something about sound.</em>  <em>The game soundtrack is based on the song <strong>‚ÄúSome Things Never Change‚Äù</strong> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devo"><strong>Devo</strong></a> .</em>  <em>Do you have a story about why this song was chosen, and who, in principle, was responsible for the sound design of the game?</em> </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/f3/bg/hz/f3bghzprm01oxzewzd2aujm3epg.jpeg" align="left" width="40%" hspace="10">  - I may not be accurate here.  As far as I know, <em>Tim Leary</em> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Mothersbaugh"><em>Mark Mathersbo</em></a> of <em>Devo</em> <em>[pictured]</em> were friends.  Somehow, most likely through <em>Tim</em> , we had an intro, and we met up with <em>Mark</em> in his studio in <em>Marina Del Rey</em> .  <em>Mark</em> is a cool guy, very savvy in technical matters.  We listened to a lot of tracks from the new album <em>Devo</em> , <em>Mark</em> thought that <em>‚ÄúSome Things Never Change‚Äù</em> would be the best for our project, and we were in solidarity with him.  <em>Mark</em> gave us a digital copy of the song.  Working with sound files in the late 80s is still a headache.  <em>Bill "Burger" Heinman</em> (now <em>Rebecca Heinman</em> ) was a real wizard, he was able to process the source file and make it 8-bit for <em>C64</em> and 1-bit for other platforms.  That was the first time I heard a <em>real</em> song in a computer game.  The sound was not perfect, but good enough for its time. <br clear="left"></p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNmpTIMxmrU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Q7</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <em>- Indeed the <strong>PC</strong> version</em>  <em>Anyway there is a thing about the soundtrack <strong>"Some Things Never Change"</strong> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devo"><strong>Devo</strong></a> .</em>  <em>This is what the song was about?</em> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  - This is a point I am a bit fuzzy on.  The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Mothersbaugh"><em>Mother</em></a> of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Mothersbaugh"><em>Bride</em></a> of <em>Devo</em> .  Somehow we got an intro, most likely a studio in <em>Marina del Rey</em> .  <em>Mark</em> was a super cool guy.  He was also very tech savvy.  We listened to a lot of tracks on <em>Devo's</em> new album.  <em>Mark</em> felt that it would be the best track for our project.  He made a copy of the track on a <em>DAT</em> .  It was an immense in the late 80's.  It was 8 bits on the <em>C64</em> and 1 bit on all others.  It was the first time I had heard the song.  It was not cool for its time. </blockquote></div></div><br><hr><br><p>  <em>- I think this song fits perfectly.</em>  <em>But let's go back to programming and talk a little about the architecture of the game.</em>  <em>For <strong>Neuromant,</strong> did you write a completely new engine or was it based on your previous work?</em> </p><br><p>  - Architecturally <em>Neuromant</em> consisted of two parts, <em>animation</em> and <em>gameplay</em> .  <em>The animation</em> part, with minimal updates, migrated from <em>Software Studio</em> , which gave the <em>NPC</em> animated reactions and text footnotes.  <em>The gameplay</em> engine was completely new.  Initially, it was more difficult, with abundant use of random numbers, but this part was discarded - no one likes too unpredictable games.  The game itself had two interesting tools.  The first could record the gameplay - the output was a text file.  If you feed him a game, she began to play herself.  It was for debugging.  Also, the game engine was playable by itself, without the animation part.  Again, for debugging.  <em>The gameplay</em> part of the engine could also work without <em>animation</em> .  All this made life easier for writers, including me, because we could go directly to the desired scene and work with it. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Q8</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <em>- That song suits perfectly in my view.</em>  <em>Now let's get back to programming.</em>  <em>It is based on some of your previous works?</em> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  - Neuromancer was divided into two parts: <em>animation</em> and <em>game play</em> .  The <em>animation</em> survived from <em>Software Studio</em> .  It gave all of the <em>NPCs</em> there.  The system was only had a minor update.  The <em>game play</em> engine was all new.  It wasn‚Äôt always been the case since it‚Äôs been a bit more random.  The game itself had two interesting tools.  The first was possible to record the game.  It would play by itself.  It was for debugging.  And the game engine was playable.  Again, this was for debugging.  <em>Play game</em> could also run without the <em>animation</em> .  It is easier to write or edit. </blockquote></div></div><br><hr><br><p>  <em>- I would like to elaborate on the <strong>gameplay</strong> .</em>  <em>Studying the version for <strong>MS-DOS,</strong> we found out that the game uses something like a virtual machine.</em>  <em>The machine executes the bikode contained in files of the form <strong>"R% n.BIH"</strong> , which, apparently, are scripts for <strong>NPC</strong> .</em>  <em>These files are a nuclear mix of control data, bytecode, object code 8086, and ASCII strings.</em>  <em>Are these features of a particular version or part of the original architecture?</em> </p><br><p>  ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt work a lot with ports, except that I explained the code for <em>6502nd</em> to programmers, but it sounds like it‚Äôs based on game <em>DAT files</em> .  I combined animation and gameplay in these files, in addition, there was also code for levels.  Do not forget that the <em>6502nd Assembler</em> did not have a linker, so I wrote it. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Q9</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <em>- I want to get a closer look at the <strong>gameplay</strong> part of this.</em>  <em>Exploring the <strong>MS-DOS</strong> version of the game we found that it utilizes it.</em>  <em>The machine executes the bytecode stored in <strong>"R% n.BIH"</strong> data files, which seems to be an <strong>NPC</strong> scripts.</em>  <em>These are some 8086 object code, and ASCII strings.</em>  <em>Or is it a specific version?</em> <br><br>  - I don‚Äôt need to know how to use the data files.  I like to play together in the data files.  There would also be a secret.  I created one. </blockquote></div></div><br><hr><br><p>  <em>- Well, since we are working with the port, I have nothing to specifically ask about the code, do you have anything to add?</em>  <em>We have already discussed some low-level techniques, but maybe you will recall some interesting problems from working on the game logic?</em> </p><br><p>  - In fact, right now I can not remember anything like that.

When you are ready. </blockquote></div></div><br><hr><br><p>  <em>- Of course, Troy.</em>  <em>Thank you for your time.</em>  <em>Hope you enjoyed this interview.</em>  <em>A small question finally: your favorite game?</em> </p><br><p>  - The only thing I'm playing now is the <em>X-Plane</em> simulator.  She's just great.  Sometimes I play on my <em>iPad</em> and I really like games with interesting physics, for example, <em>Hello Stars</em> .  It seems to be stupid, but made talent.  Sometimes I play copying old-school 8-bit games such as <em>Pitfall</em> and <em>Donkey Kong</em> , but I‚Äôm not very far advanced, I simply don‚Äôt have enough time for that. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Q11</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <em>- Yeah, I will.</em>  <em>Thanks for your time, Troy.</em>  <em>I hope you like the interview.</em>  <em>There is a little question: what is your favorite game?</em> <br><br>  - The only game I really play nowadays is a simulation, X-Plane.  It is awesome.  I really like physic based games like Hello Stars.  It is stupid, but clever.  8 bit games like Pitfall!  and Donkey Kong.  Neither is very far along, never seem to have enough time. </blockquote></div></div><br><hr><br><p>  Such a story.  The interview turned out to be small in volume, but, in my opinion, very capacious in terms of details.  I published the English version in my <a href="https://henadzimatuts.github.io/2018/09/10/behind-the-neuromancer-game.html">blog</a> . </p><br><p>  Regarding the game, since the publication of the last article, a lot has been done: dialogue, inventory, saving / loading, and a lot of other things.  If everything goes well, then in a couple of weeks we will have quite a playable build, so far without cyberspace, but it will be possible to advance a little along the plot.  The next number part of the cycle will be released after we get this very build.  But now, everything is there, in my <a href="https://henadzimatuts.github.io/">blog</a> , you can follow the news on the project. </p></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422625/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422625/</a></p>
