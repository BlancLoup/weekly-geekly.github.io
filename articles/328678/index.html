Participants will share both successful and unworked practitioners, discuss how scram-events take place in various companies, and what techniques and tools are used.  The meeting will be interesting for practicing scrum-masters and sympathizers.  In addition to the reports, a discussion is planned on the topics of the mitap in an informal setting. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Program and reports: </h2><br><br>  <b>Dmitry Mamonov, Wrike "OKR: Strategic Planning on Top of Scrum"</b> <b><br></b> <br>  Wrike as an R &amp; D organization has been working for Scrum for two years now.  We still remember how it all began and already know what came of it.  Team coordination is one of the key challenges for Scrum's major development.  I will talk about what conflicts exist between the correct implementation of Scrum and the need for strategic planning, as well as the solution we have chosen - the concept of Scrum + OKR (Objective and Key Results).

      <b>Andrei Tolmachyov, Agile Coach in PeterService - ‚ÄúFear and loathing in component teams, or why we need to stop sharing into teams of front-end, backend, and testers‚Äù</b> <br><br>  There is an interesting pattern: often with the growth of a company, teams are formed in it (and then departments) by specialization: front-end, backend, implementers, testers, etc.  It seems logical, is not it?  Only here problems from such a way of organizing are usually more than advantages. <br><br>  In the report, I will tell from the experience of several companies what the division into component teams leads to.  Let's talk about what to do about it, and how teams are organized in LeSS - the Scrum scaling framework, which runs the largest Scrum in the world. <br><br>  <b>Natalya Antipova, Scrum Master Wrike - ‚ÄúFacilitation tools to help Scrum Master‚Äù</b> <br><br>  The purpose of this report is to provide practical tools with which you can avoid a number of pressing problems in the work of Scrum-Master and Teams.  We will analyze with examples, when these tools work and when they don‚Äôt, and how they help in the daily life of Scrum Teams. <br><br>  <b>Anna Obukhova, Agile Coach at ScrumTrek ‚ÄúScrum Master of Influence Technology‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Who is the Scrum Master?  Powerless Leader, facilitator, coach, process expert, I saw such definitions as mentor, assistant?  I can agree with these definitions, but at the same time I am constantly confronted with the fact that these definitions do not give a clear understanding of "what do we do to get the desired result from the team or process."  The Master Scrum does not have a carrot or stick, there is no job description giving the right to order.  He has ... influence ... so it turns out that the Scrum Master is an agent of influence.  Already easier, because influence is a set of influence technologies.  If you know what influence technologies are used in the Agile process, what results we expect and how they can be changed or consolidated success. <br><br>  In this report I will sort out what technologies of influence the actions of Scrum Masters consist of, give examples of what facilitation techniques and exercises are aimed at, which are recommended by colleagues and in the literature. <br><br>  Fear, laughter, mutual responsibility, response gestures, the desire for success, the formulation of the result and the form of presenting information, these are all the constituent parts of which impact on other people consist.  Scrum Master must clearly understand this in order to be able to benefit the team and the project. <br><br>  This is not a manipulation, this influence and the better you can influence, the more successful your project and the more successful you are as a Scrum Master or in any role where you need to be able to get predictable results from other people. <br><br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://wriketeam.timepad.ru/event/482057/"><b>Sign up for free</b></a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_ASY-J-se9Q"><b>Live webcast</b></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/328678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/328678/</a></p>
