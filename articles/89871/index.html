In the delivery rules they clearly state: <br>  " <i>Pay attention! The procedure for the transfer of goods does not provide for its testing and expectations of the results by the freight forwarder.</i> " <br><br>  But, it is not interesting to me then to deal with the store about the replacement, return, or something else, in case it turns out to be dead pixels or some other defects, such as a high-frequency squeak. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Accordingly, before the acquisition, I want to be able to make sure that the equipment will not contain defects, with which I then have to live.  It is clear that problems may not arise, but what if they do?  Actually, I want to reduce this risk, for this, when placing an order I made a clear mark that when I receive an order I intend to check it.

      In the morning, they called me from the store and said that you can check the monitor‚Äôs work only if you take it from our head office at <a href="http://maps.yandex.ru/%3Ftext%3D%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%252C%2520%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%252C%2520%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B0%2520%25D0%2590%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%252C%25207%25D1%25815%26sll%3D37.767106%252C55.810936%26sspn%3D0.021954%252C0.009267%26l%3Dmap">7, Amurskaya str., 107497, Moscow, p.</a> <br><br>  To put it mildly, it is far from my habitat (sorry for <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC_(%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0)">pleonasm</a> ).  As a result, having communicated a little, they dispersed that they would have to refuse the order. <br><br>  Well, well, because  it was morning, and the monitor really wanted to get on Sunday, I decided to go to <a href="http://digitalshop.ru/">DigitalShop</a> .  They do not have such a strange ban on testing, and there wasn‚Äôt, they always gave them the opportunity to check what they acquired, and no one ever bent. <br><br>  Well, well, since there was no E2420HD there, I decided to take a simpler model: <a href="http://www.benq.ru/products/LCD/index.cfm/product/1098">Benq G2420HD</a> . <br><br>  So, I made a quick order, I continue to work at work. <br><br>  After a while the bell rings, they tell me that delivery can be only on Monday.  Well monday so monday what problems.  And the problem is. <br><br>  I work, respectively, at home I can be no sooner than when I leave work.  In short, guaranteed to be at home at 19:00 and later.  But, the store has an opinion on this matter: <br><br>  Subject to placing an order on a business day before 14:00, delivery is usually carried out on the next business day. <br>  The minimum interval for the courier service is 4 hours. <br>  Schedule for the delivery department <br>  Monday - Friday 10:00 - 21:00 <br>  Saturday 11:00 - 16:00 <br>  Sunday By special arrangement. <br><br>  So, the key phrase is apparently the phrase " <b>The minimum interval for the courier service is 4 hours</b> ." <br><br>  I say no, you should be from 18:00. <br><br>  I say, well, of course, I say, I can only be from 19, no way before, make a note so that when developing the delivery route, it was taken into account that you need to bring at my address no earlier than 19:00. <br><br>  No, they say so, no one will wait for you until you come to the 19th, be from 18. Or let us bring you to work. <br><br>  This is certainly an option, but, first of all, in order for me to test it at work, I need to pick up the courier with him, but he will not give up the monitor, and he will have to wait.  And in order to pick it up with you, you need to order a pass, and who will give me the courier passport information?  In short, this is not the best option, and then drag along with it ... why should I, as a client, have such difficulties? <br><br>  In short, again, decided to cancel the order <br><br>  Further, I began to frantically search, and where, in fact, still buy something ?!  Looked at various online stores, and everywhere, in terms of delivery they say about the inadmissibility of checking equipment, with the exception of external inspection.  Some stores expressly declare that they deliver via CityLink, and there are exactly the same conditions that I quoted above.  Among those reviewed were the following online stores ... So, I realized that I did not remember the list, and on Yandex Market there were only 3 stores offering this monitor. <br><br>  In general, I realized that I did not want to buy at the online store yet.  And what to do?  I decided to look at regular offline stores. <br><br>  One of my favorites is the <a href="http://www.digital.ru/">White Wind DIGITAL</a> .  Favorite, because I don‚Äôt remember any special problems with it.  And I don‚Äôt also remember ‚Äúno special‚Äù problems, apparently they were not there. <br><br>  So, there is no this monitor there, there are no 24 "monitors at all, with the exception of the <a href="http://www.digital.ru/goods/monitors-lcd/apple/610038.htm">Apple LED Cinema Display</a> , which costs absolutely different money. <br><br>  Out of desperation, I went to <a href="http://www.mvideo.ru/price/lvl_8/class_79/mark_734/">M-Video</a> , there Benqov more than 22 "no. <br><br>  I also looked at various other options - no <br><br>  So it turns out, firstly, offline, I cannot buy in online stores, because  it is not there, in online stores, I either cannot go to a meeting and deliver at a convenient time for me (to take into account an hour shift), or they refuse my desire to check the device. <br><br>  There are two questions in this connection: <br><br>  1. what to do? <br><br>  2. Why is such an issue? <br><br>  On the first question, the answer is simple, first, I‚Äôll go to the <a href="http://www.tkmitino.ru/">Mitinsky radio market</a> on Sunday, I still need to buy the outgoing fan for the hard drive, so I‚Äôll look at the monik at the same time, I‚Äôll find it and it will not look like a used one.  If it doesn't work, I‚Äôll probably order it at DigitalShop with delivery to work, as  I see no other way out in this situation. <br><br>  The answer to the second question is probably, in fact, simple.  It is clear that the store is also not interested, to carry goods to and from there, if customers refuse to buy, and if something goes wrong, after receiving the money, the client will have to go through all sorts of obstacles, such as a visit to a store that works only during working hours and on working days, and even if someone comes, go there and force them to take the goods back.  But, because if the shops allow themselves to abandon customers now, there are two options: either they have a very good life now, or there are too many customers who are willing to take risks, hoping ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù, which, in fact, returns to the first assumption that they live well now ... <br>  Maybe I have some excessive demands ?! <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/89871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/89871/</a></p>
