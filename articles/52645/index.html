Can it be more profitable?  Of course, if you follow at least those ten points that are listed below.  Go through this ‚Äúcheck list‚Äù carefully and you, for sure, have a couple of remarks to your store.  Sometimes even large and solid online stores make such children's mistakes. <br><br>  Since writing this article, I encountered another common error.  Therefore, a bonus, eleventh case has been added specially for hack-readers, helping your customers to leave the online store without buying.

      1. The <b>main page looks faded and impersonal.</b> <br>  What does your visitor see when entering the store's main page?  Can it be said with 100% certainty that this is an online store?  Can he find out what this store is selling?  A typical mistake is disregard for the laws of commercial design.  In addition to the small print and the lack of proper description, it is often not always possible to find the center of the composition.  All texts and pictures look either secondary or each element is trying to "shout down" the next.  Recall what a free classifieds newspaper looks like, filled with a mass of motley ad units. <br><br>  Pity the time and eyes of your visitor - he will linger longer on your site and, perhaps, will make an order. <br><br>  2. <b>Are there ways to communicate with managers?</b> <br>  It is easier for some customers to come to the store and find the goods themselves on the shelves, while others find it more convenient to ask the seller directly about the availability and cost.  Even if your store was created by a professional designer, check that those who are more comfortable to call or write to you, having stated their questions, did not have to search for a long time how to do this.  The ideal option would be a phone number that is always navid.  For example, at the top of the page. <br><br>  3. <b>Is there any information on payment methods and delivery terms?</b> <br>  Is it worth it for a visitor to spend time searching for a product in your store if he is unable to pay in the ways that you can accept?  Is it worth it to spend time if you can not deliver the paid goods to your buyer?  The answers are obvious - you cannot serve such a client, just as you cannot serve those who could not find information about payment and delivery methods on your site.  Even if the latter live in a block from your office, and have the opportunity to pay, they will not know about it. <br><br>  For good manners, you can take the presence of the item on payment and delivery in a prominent place. <br><br>  4. <b>Are payment and delivery methods convenient for your potential customer?</b> <br>  Even if information about how to pay, where and for how much you deliver, hangs in a prominent place, your visitor may leave disappointed because of <a name="habracut"></a>  scarcity of your services.  Try to find out in which ways it will be more convenient to pay to your potential buyers.  Also, find out their wishes for delivery.  Learn and embody! <br><br>  5. <b>Is it convenient to find the right product in your store?</b> <br>  Often, buyers pass by the desired shelf with the goods, not noticing it.  In addition to rubrics and directories, it is good to have a search form.  Well if it is with auto substitution.  And the search results should be issued as correctly as search engines do.  It is not difficult - there are a lot of ready-made solutions. <br><br>  6. <b>Does ‚Äúproduct page‚Äù sell?</b> <br>  ‚ÄúProduct Page‚Äù or, in other words, ‚Äúproduct page‚Äù is perhaps one of the most important in the online store.  After all, it is on it that the decision to purchase or not to purchase goods from you is made.  All conditions noted in paragraph 1 are valid for this page.  In addition, check if there are enough good descriptions for the product?  Is the cost indicated?  Is it a quality photo?  Is it immediately clear what you need to do to buy a product: put it in the basket, call, enter the code or something else? <br><br>  Create push buttons with text, such as ‚ÄúPut in the basket‚Äù or ‚ÄúBuy!‚Äù <br><br>  7. <b>Is the item available?</b> <br>  To save someone else's time is to pay respect to others.  Respect your visitors, tell them about the presence or absence of a particular product immediately.  Respect your managers, not forcing to call only to refuse due to the lack of position in the warehouse. <br>  It is pleasant to deal with those who have information about the availability of goods is always in sight and always relevant. <br><br>  8. <b>Is it easy to find a cart after adding a product to it?</b> <br>  After all, it was not for nothing that online stores adopted the analogy of a basket with supermarkets, where it is always next to you.  Ridiculous search basket search sites still occur.  Good usability is also respect for your client. <br><br>  9. <b>Your managers are silent.</b> <br>  We did everything according to the instructions: found the goods and paid for it.  What happens next?  In good stores they send us an email with further instructions, and then they call and repeat everything again.  And what happens in your store?  Does the manager respond to messages written in the feedback form on the site?  Does the letter sent to the address given in the contact information respond?  Is the telephone line free? <br><br>  10. <b>What do you give to your client after he has made a purchase, except for goods, checks and guarantees?</b> <br>  Many do not give anything.  Therefore, in competition, they are easily circumvented by those who leave at least something behind them.  For example, a business card or flyer of your store.  Or someone else's shop.  Yes, do not be surprised, partnership is a great thing!  We will tell about it soon. <br><br>  And one more typical mistake, <b>do not be silent when they praise you and even more so when they scold you</b> . <br>  Remember how often you check for new replies to a message you left on a forum, blog or anywhere else.  Are you interested in whether they will answer you and what they will answer.  It is also interesting and visitor to your store.  Reviews on your site about yourself or about the product is your dialogue with the buyer.  This is what others spend thousands of dollars on - your consumer needs analysis.  If you are scolded in the case, you do not need to delete such reviews, better say: ‚Äúthank you‚Äù <br><br>  Do not write comments to yourself, imitating a heated discussion.  It always repels. <br><br>  This is not a complete list of what should be checked in a running online store or taken into account when developing.  But the fulfillment of these ten conditions has already increased the conversion of visitors into buyers. <br><br>  Let's go over the points again briefly: <br><br>  1. Do not save on design. <br>  2. Place a phone number in plain sight. <br>  3. Next to the phone number, place information about the methods of payment and delivery. <br>  4. Expand payment methods, think again delivery methods. <br>  5. Work through the site search to the smallest detail. <br>  6. Do not save on copywriters and photographers.  Specify the price immediately.  Describe the visitor the desired action to complete the purchase. <br>  7. Specify current information about the availability of goods.  Automate it. <br>  8. Respect your visitors! <br>  9. Check the performance of all communication channels. <br>  10. Leave something behind you. <br>  11. Work with reviews. <br><br>  This and other articles can be found on the <a href="http://ish.com.ua/">blog about online stores in Ukrainian realities.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52645/</a></p>
