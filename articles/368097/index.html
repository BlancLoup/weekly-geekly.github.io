  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In English Wikipedia found 272 mystifications, which existed for more than a year. Record - 10 years and 1 month</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Fans of raffles created a huge number of hoax articles describing non-existent people or events on Wikipedia.  The oldest "joke" lasted more than ten years.  In total, 272 mystifications were found in the English segment of the resource, which existed for more than one year. <br><br>  John Robishau was born in 1866 in Thibodoo, New Orleans, and died in 1939 in Louisiana.  He was an American musician, drummer and violinist, as well as the leader of his own jazz band. <br><br>  And Jack Robishau is the hero of a fake Wikipedia article, a fictional serial rapist from the same state.  An article about him was created on July 31, 2005, and it lasted until September 3, 2015 ‚Äî ten years and one month.

But fictional.  The article about him existed from November 17, 2005 to September 19, 2015 - nine years and ten months.  Wikipedia editors have not found a single reliable source that would confirm the existence of this character. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAustralian Aboriginal Deity‚Äù Jar'Edo Wens is another, this time twice-fictional character, to whom the Wikipedia article on May 29, 2005 was devoted to.  Moreover, it was translated for the French section of Wikipedia.  The deity received a modified version of the name Jared Owens (Jared Owens).  Before the removal of Jack Robichaud and Guillermo Garc√≠a, Jar'Edo Wens held the first place among the oldest counterfeit articles ‚Äî nine years and nine months. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/49a/9c4/d84/49a9c4d84a28154ba7545f2b70adaa97.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>In the caves of Kimberley, Australia, you will not find images of the deity Jar'Edo Wens</i> <br><br>  Pikes on Cliffs is a fictional place, a beach house with a blacksmith shop and a well.  The sailor of the XVI century, William Simms swam to shore after the death sentence imposed by Sir Francis Drake.  This house has not been seen, and the facts of the existence of the sailor himself have not been found.  The article was deleted after nine years and eight and a half months after creation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/477/913/066/4779130665df0d179a5e6d00823ea0ca.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br>  <i>North Coast of Esta√ßa de Bares, Spain, where the Pikes on Cliffs house should have been</i> <br><br>  It is easy to imagine that in the 1960s there was a band in the UK whose members barked while performing musical compositions.  Perhaps that is why the article on The Doggs lasted nine years and eight months.  The article was deleted as ‚ÄúFrank hoax‚Äù, although you can find one song by the performers of the time The Doggs - Billy's gotta run.  In it, they did not bark. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/750/f37/334/750f37334240041c3fadd635f5c51fe9.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br>  Gregory Namoff was born on February 26, 1924 in Great Neck, New York, and died on October 12, 2002 in Boca Rato, Florida.  He was an "internationally known" investment banker.  In 1974, he became a member of the Watergate scandal, but was not found guilty.  In the early 1980s, he turned his attention to computers, invested in Apple Computer and Microsoft, and sold his company GN Limited.  In 1998, he ran for the US Senate against Bob Graham, but his opponent campaigned, linking Nammoff with Nixon and Watergate.  In 2002, Nemoff died due to lupus erythematosus. <br><br>  Not a single fact from the paragraph above editors Wikipedia could not confirm.  This man has never been. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6cf/b54/55e/6cfb5455e48f88b96a4bba18dd832032.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br>  <i>Watergate Scandal Participants</i> <br><br>  In September 2005, one of the users of Wikipedia had few real television programs, so he wrote an article about the Double Hour show.  In this non-existent show, the presenters talked about historical events for two hours. <br><br>  A total of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_hoaxes_on_Wikipedia">more than 270 hoaxes</a> hung on Wikipedia for over a year.  Among them are articles about professors from the University of Berkeley, about animated shows, musical groups, poets, a note in an article about Lord Byron about his pets - the crocodile and badger.  Wikipedia warns: do not create fake articles, otherwise you will be blocked. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368097/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368097/</a></p>
