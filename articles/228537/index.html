If the game failed to light up in the first few months after the release, then the chances of getting to the main page of the store are becoming less and less every day.  Even an amazing program can drown among tons of junk or low-quality applications. <br><br>  The second point is that not all companies get a quality product the first time.  If the application came out with critical errors, then it will be extremely difficult for him to win over the audience.

      The following situation: now the most important resource is time, so many people release the application functionality in parts, updates.  Therefore, when the application becomes really interesting, it has been in the store for half a year and only a few thousand people have installed it, and the rest have not found out about it.  Some developers simply hammer on it, others lay out their creation anew.  For example, large companies like King and Supercell agree in advance with Apple about the feature of already popular products after the upgrade.  But not everyone uses this opportunity, not everyone can succeed. <br><br>  Apple seems to have listened to the developers and created the ‚ÄúBest New Game Updates‚Äù section.  According to our observations, there are games that have already proven themselves well.  Perhaps, Apple has made a tool to support only those who have already achieved success in grossing.  We will observe. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  How the number of installations depends on the weight of the application </h4><br>  Fiksu <a href="http://www.fiksu.com/blog/larger-your-game-download-size-lower-your-conversion-rate-may-be">calculated</a> statistics on conversions to installs depending on the size of the applications.  To begin with, it is important to emphasize that the statistics take into account only gaming applications and only motivated advertising - Fiksu themselves placed this information in a footnote at the end of the report.  Without an understanding of this fact, a false picture may emerge.  So, this is data on the effectiveness of conversions to installations when using motivated ads. <br><br>  In general, the statistics do not show anything new - the more the application weighs, the fewer conversions into installations.  The highest efficiency in applications weighing 0-20mb is 87.94%.  But even for applications larger than 100mb, the conversion is not much different - 76.31%.  It is significant that when using motivated advertising, the size of the application is not such an important factor.  Most likely, the more actively the technologies develop, the less this difference will be felt - if the user can quickly and painlessly install both small-sized applications and applications of 100+ mb, the difference in the number of installations will be smoothed out. <br><br><br><h4>  Disney continues its attack on stor </h4><br>  The match-3 direction has been developing especially hard lately.  After a successful game based on a frozen cartoon, the inevitable happened - her reskin came out under the wicked Angelina Croft, followed by another novelty in which Disney characters from a variety of cartoons met each other. <br>  <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2014/07/01/line-disney-tsum-tsum-launches-on-ios-google-play/">Welcome</a> Line: Disney Tsum Tsum!  The game publishes the famous <s>ICQ</s> Line <s>Messenger</s> , successfully (Line says about 14 million downloads and Top 1 Free) having started in Japan.  However, the launch country can be guessed by name.  On one of the Barbarian languages, it would sound like a Disney Stack Stack, so that the moon-tongued gaijin could immediately understand what the whole point was.  Now this application came out in the world hire. <br><br>  Players can enjoy the blitz match-3 mechanics (60 seconds to collect the maximum number of points) with the development system and levelers, as well as the ability to link to the Line account, which will give access to life-giving social elements like leadermobiles and the ability to send virtual gifts. <br><br>  In order for the user to fully enjoy the start of the game, Disney announced the release of the Tsum Tsum soft toy line.  By the way, these plush match-3 girls have a special area on their tummies, with which you can clean the screens of your devices.  Available in three sizes!  Well, is not it lovely? <br><br><br><h4>  YO, HODOR </h4><br>  After the exit to no one needed (just a couple of million dollars of investment!), But still having gathered a great news crop, hyip, hatred, imitators and opponents of the Yo program, humanity seemed to be at an impasse.  Where to grow? <br><br>  But the singularity is overcome!  Finally, a <a href="http://www.insidemobileapps.com/2014/07/01/yo-hodor-an-app-that-sends-game-of-thrones-lovers-nothing-but-hodor/">hit</a> , something close to art, cinema and in general ... Why explain something when there is an application that sends the most necessary and correct context message to friends?  Perfectly suitable moment, subtly depending on mood, life situation and your desire to encourage, it will cause a lively emotional response from anyone. <br>  In a word - yes, now you can send bulk contacts "HODOR". <br><br>  HODOR. <br><br><br><h4>  98% of Google Play revenue comes from F2P </h4><br>  AppAnnie has published a special <a href="http://blog.appannie.com/google-io-special-report-launch-2014">report</a> on how Google Play has grown over the past year.  We, as usual, tell about the most interesting facts, according to which many interesting conclusions can be made. <br><br><h6>  Games generate 90% of Google Play revenue. </h6><br>  Similar figures in the AppStore.  Games currently earn the largest amount of money in the mobile market. <br><br><h6>  F2P revenue share is 98% of all app store revenue. </h6><br>  Full dominance of this model of monetization in the market.  And the change of vector in the near future is not worth it.  Therefore, before you make a paid kazualka, you need to think everything through well and calculate - it can go sideways. <br><br><h6>  Over the past year, the number of applications on Google Play has grown by 60% and now stands at 1.5 million. </h6><br>  More and more developers are entering this platform.  If earlier even large companies were in no hurry to launch their titles there (for example, Supercell), now it is simply necessary if you want to earn money. <br><br><br><h6>  Google Play's total revenue grew 2.4 times and continues to grow rapidly </h6><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9d9/029/625/9d9029625ea05e5808e4c1c3b690f3ac.png"><br><br><br><h6>  All of the most active countries on Google Play have increased in settings over the past year. </h6><br>  Positive growth was shown by Brazil and Russia, which now occupy the second and third place in the list of countries with the largest number of downloads!  Still it was for the money) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56a/55d/9d4/56a55d9d45006a9eb8981c8cadd16e47.png"><br><br><br><h6>  Japan continues to lead Google Play by revenue. </h6><br>  US goes to second place.  Android is beginning to occupy an increasing share of the US market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3fb/d97/e81/3fbd97e816d57541d50f5abc5dadf6f7.png"><br><br><h6>  This is how the top countries in terms of downloads and earnings look: </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6c/a22/9b8/b6ca229b89e532c09d97a9fb1c6aeb9e.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/228537/">https://habr.com/ru/post/228537/</a></p>
