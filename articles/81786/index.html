The use of the framework has made it easier <br>  system developers and integrators to write friendly user interfaces correctly <br>  working in major browsers. </li><li>  <i>Caching</i> : for fast page generation, Jahia supports <br>  multi-level cache, starting with the database level and up to the level of html-pages.  Cache is a cluster <br>  compatible and helps make the system scalable and productive.  Cache implementations are <br>  pluggable. </li><li>  <i>Single sign-on (SSO) or single sign-on technology</i> : Jahia is compatible with <br>  all major implementations of the SSO (Single Sign-On) mechanism, including NTLM, CAS, authentication <br>  jee container, etc.  The subsystem is connected using the mechanism of conveyors (pipeline <br>  mechanism), which will be described later in this document. </li><li>  <i>Content Management System (WCM)</i> : Jahia was first developed as a system <br>  Web Content Management System, and therefore this component is <br>  most mature.  Starting from version 2.0, the content management system has the capabilities <br>  content editing right on the page, incorporates typical content objects and <br>  allows you to use portlets. </li><li>  <i>Portal (Portal)</i> : Jahia is not a portal server in its strict sense, <br>  as it provides a much more customizable environment than traditional <br>  servers.  The back-end of the system fully complies with the JSR-286 standard, so there is a possibility <br>  Easily integrate portlets on system web pages for sharing with regular <br>  content objects. </li><li>  <i>File repository (File repository)</i> : Portal integrated with file repository <br>  JCR (Java Content Repository), which allows system users to publish binary data <br>  access the repository through various interfaces (for example, WebDAV or <br>  Windows Shared Folders). </li><li>  <i>Access Control Lists (ACLs)</i> : Jahia is modular <br>  system widely using access control subsystem.  Its use makes it possible <br>  effectively differentiate user access to various subsystems and services of Jahia.  Subsystem <br>  Access control is available throughout the portal. </li><li>  <i>Clustering</i> : Jahia allows for system deployment on a cluster, <br>  thus providing redundancy and load sharing.  This article will <br>  reviewed the overall architecture of the Jahia cluster. </li><li>  <i>Search and Indexing System</i> : in the list of main <br>  The capabilities of most content management systems are search and index support. <br>  Jahia makes it possible to search and index not only by content, but also in the embedded <br>  file storage.  The portal allows you to search for a specific family of objects. <br>  content, and distribute indexing tasks across multiple servers. </li><li>  <i>Administration (Administration)</i> : The system presents two separate <br>  portal management interface: for server administrators and site administrators.  it <br>  separation allows you to distribute tasks for portal support by roles.  Interfaces give <br>  users the ability to manage all subsystems Jahia, including administration <br>  users and groups, permissions, loaded design templates, portlets, categories and so <br>  Further‚Ä¶ </li></ul><br>  Subsequent low-level subsystems are not part of the portal, but their use provides <br>  storing and accessing information that Jahia processes. <br><ul><li>  <i>Database (Database)</i> : Jahia supports all major DBMS, including DBMS with <br>  open source (MySQL, PostgreSQL).  Portal architecture is not tied to a specific <br>  DBMS implementations as Jahia uses Hibernate ORM technology. </li><li>  <i>File system (Filesystem)</i> : the file system is needed for storage <br>  search index, binary data array (BLOB) or character data array (CLOB).  (By <br>  By default, the portal stores binary and character data in the database).  The file system must be <br>  distributed, if you plan to use a cluster, with responsibility for the correct <br>  the work of distributed functions is assigned to the file system itself. </li><li>  <i>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)</i> : Jahia does not require <br>  advanced configuration to work with most LDAP servers (Lightweight Directory Access <br>  Protocol), including OpenLDAP and ActiveDirectory.  Together with LDAP single sign-on technology is <br>  The main tool to ensure comfortable access to content to end users. <br>  For example, by applying NTLM authentication and ActiveDirectory, Jahia will be able to use authentication <br>  in a domain that Windows users go through when they start working with a computer. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  UI Components </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2eb/1ce/a52/2eb1cea5276fdbfe9231cf18008eaeb3.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  This figure shows the various components of the user interface that <br>  provides jahia. <br><br>  Starting with Jahia 6.0, the basis for all components is the <i>Google Web Toolkit</i> .  Using <br>  GWT, developers can quickly write and debug AJAX user interface components.  AT <br>  Jahia uses the GXT component library with pre-built components to work with <br>  tables, trees and other standard interface elements. <br><br>  The <i>tri-panel</i> component is a standard Jahia user interface component, <br>  displaying a panel of hierarchical links with a list of descendants and an information window. <br><br>  The <i>toolbar</i> component is used for quick access to tools <br>  switch navigation modes / edit content.  The toolbar is similar to the ones that <br>  used in standard desktop applications, except that the tools on it are displayed <br>  depending on the context (viewing and editing rights for the current user, current user <br>  view mode). <br><br>  On top of these components, Jahia has a complete set of custom elements. <br>  interface: from file management components to category management, including components <br>  browsing and navigating breadcrumbs and <i>bookmarks</i> . <br><br><h4>  Authentication and Authorization </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e69/8ea/388/e698ea388ad5c4772a1498d9e9cfab35.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Jahia allows you to use the following authentication mechanisms: <br><ul><li>  CAS SSO (Single Sign-On with CAS, Central Authentication Service); </li><li>  NTLM (NT LAN Manager from Microsoft for Windows NT); </li><li>  JEE container authentication; </li><li>  a pluggable authentication pipeline, with which you can easily add <br>  support for one-time registration technologies. </li></ul><br>  After the user is identified once, the system continues. <br>  delineation of rights.  The composition of the system of delineation of rights: <br><ul><li>  access control lists for content objects; </li><li>  permissions for all user actions; </li><li>  connected services for users (user services); </li><li>  Plug-in services for groups (group services); </li><li>  LDAP compatibility; </li><li>  storage of user database in the database (in the default settings). </li></ul><br>  The figure above shows how the various levels of the subsystem (including plug-in interfaces) <br>  interact with each other.  Routing service allows using unified access interfaces. <br>  to DB and LDAP-storage of user base.  By implementing the service provider interfaces you can <br>  add additional services. <br><br><h4>  Design Templates </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f5/7f9/77d/7f57f977d4dbfb054c85bea4dd79da1c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The system of Jahia templates depends on how the information will be displayed on the page.  Templates <br>  registrations are grouped into a <i>set</i> .  The set of templates is subsequently uploaded to the server.  External <br>  the type of site will depend on which template set you choose.  One set can expand <br>  another, "inheriting" it. <br><br>  The composition of the set of templates: <br><ul><li>  content definition files (CND); </li><li>  JSP pages; </li><li>  themes and skins; </li><li>  deployment descriptor for a set of templates <br>  (required); </li><li>  resources (resource bundles); </li><li>  Java classes. </li></ul><br>  When Jahia starts, it will determine all the templates available in the system (the WEB folder <i><br></i>  <i>INF / var / shared_templates</i> ) and deploy them to the server.  In development mode <br>  Any changes to the deployment descriptor will cause the template set to reload, thereby <br>  allowing instantly see changes in the design on the server. <br><br>  As was shown above in the figure, you can apply <br>  many different technologies: <br><ul><li>  <i>Tag Libraries</i> : in order to facilitate support and update templates in Jahia <br>  decided to abandon the use of scripts.  To do this, the system included the rich <br>  tag libraries that work fine with the standard JSTL tag set.  Library data <br>  provide functions for working with user interface elements (for example, working with <br>  toolbar), the ability to query content objects, connection mechanisms <br>  parent template tag include (support inheritance).  Detailed Library Information <br>  tags can be found in the Template developer guide. </li><li>  <i>The mechanism of inheritance</i> : to facilitate the development of new sets in the templates can <br>  use an inheritance mechanism similar to inheritance in the Java language.  In the case of developing a new <br>  set using the inheritance mechanism, you need to override only those templates in which <br>  there are changes, and the rest will be inherited from the parent template.  All this also applies to <br>  files that are included in the include tag (the parent template is scanned for the presence of a file, <br>  to be connected if it has not been redefined locally).  Inheritance mechanism will allow <br>  administrators to ensure consistency of design on a large number of portal sites, with <br>  This preserves the ability to use completely different sets of templates for each specific <br>  site. </li><li>  <i>Deployment</i> : As mentioned earlier, template sets can be deployed in <br>  Jahia at server startup.  Therefore, it is necessary to simply add new sets to the Jahia installation. <br>  Once you download a set, you make it available in the system.  Well, site administrators in their <br>  the queue will already define the sets that will be used on the portal sites: either this <br>  there will be different sets of templates for each site, or there will be one parent set in the system, from <br>  which all other patterns will inherit design. </li><li>  <i>Skins themes and skins</i> : themes are used to give to one <br>  a set of templates of different types.  As an example, a set in which there are topics on <br>  Seasons: winter theme, spring, summer and autumn themes.  Subject can be set <br>  administrator, or given the choice of the user.  Shells allow content creators <br>  make different content objects of the same type in different ways. </li><li>  <i>Content definitions</i> : Jahia uses a standard format. <br>  JCR content descriptions that have been extended (by internationalization, strong typing of elements <br>  content) for more powerful content management. </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Caching </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ed/7d5/c04/1ed7d5c04750a195c399cdfb99bd48ac.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  For high-performance web systems like Jahia, <i>caching is</i> necessary for <br>  <i>avoid re-generation of dynamic content under high loads</i> .  On the picture <br>  The caching subsystem architecture is shown. <br><br>  All high-level caches are based on <i>the cache service (cache service)</i> , representing <br>  cache implementation  Below this service, various cache implementations can be used, some of them <br>  may depend on other Jahia services.  For example, <i>the reference cache (Reference Cache)</i> depends on <br>  <i>cluster services (Cluster service)</i> , which allows to exchange messages in a cluster Jahia. <br><br><h5>  CASH TYPES </h5><br>  All types of high-level caches use the same caching service that represents <br>  cache implementation  Starting with Jahia 5.0SP4, the system has the opportunity to apply various <br>  cache implementations for different types of cache, making the system flexible for configuration.  For example, <br>  you can use <i>EHCache</i> to cache custom html pages and use <br>  <i>ReferenceCache</i> for other types of caches.  This <i>is the default configuration</i> for Jahia. <br>  5.0SP4 and Jahia 6.0.  Naturally, it is also possible to integrate other cache implementations with <br>  using the <i>service provider interface (SPI)</i> , which <br>  provides jahia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/580/64f/aa1/58064faa1fa2b4c5428e4476b3911a89.png" alt="image"><br><br>  To optimize web page delivery performance, Jahia uses several cache levels: <br><ul><li>  browser cache </li><li>  custom html pages cache (front-end HTML caches), </li><li>  object cache </li><li>  database cache. </li></ul><br>  Each of these levels solves its problem, pursuing a single goal: so that the values ‚Äã‚Äãare calculated <br>  only once. <br><br><h5>  BROWSER CASH </h5><br>  Despite the fact that this cache is not part of the Jahia portal, but is part of the browser, <br>  it is he who plays a critical role in ensuring good system performance for <br>  end user.  For example, the use of the GWT framework in Jahia has allowed <br>  cache the AJAX code in the browser cache, thereby freeing the portal from having to overload <br>  scripts that have not changed.  Jahia works correctly with the cache of those pages that have been changed. <br>  and controls the lifetime of the page cache, so as not to update without need rarely changing <br>  content. <br><br><h5>  CUSTOM USER HTML PAGES </h5><br>  Historically, Jahia has many implementations for the html page cache.  First <br>  The implementation was a full-page <i>html cache (full-page HTML cache)</i> .  This cache is very <br>  effective for simple pages if they are already in the cache;  and it is not very suitable for pages with <br>  different fragments (for example, displaying user information on the page). <br><br>  In Jahia 5, we introduced the <i>ESI cache server (ESI cache server)</i> , which added the ability to <br>  cache fragments of html pages.  To effectively use this technology requires <br>  a separate cache server that will run on a separate virtual machine.  Being over <br>  efficient technology for generating dynamic pages compared to full page cache, <br>  The ESI system suffers from problems with server-to-server communications that are very cunningly needed. <br>  configure for normal operation.  Also, the use of the ESI cache requires good integrators <br>  knowledge of <i>the fragmentary caching model (fragment caching model)</i> , which is not always <br>  like. <br><br>  Jahia 6 took the best from both approaches, combining the efficiency of the embedded full-page <br>  cache with fragment cache support from ESI cache server.  This cache implementation was named <br>  <i>‚ÄúContainer Cache‚Äù</i> , it applies level-level fragment caching <br>  container, making interaction with templates very simple.  Template developers will not have to <br>  add special markup to configure the correct fragmentary caching.  Even <br>  there will be a need to manage the generation of fragments, it will be much easier to do this <br>  than in previous versions of Jahia. <br><br>  <i>Skeleton Cache</i> - another html page cache implementation that caches everything <br>  the rest (except fragments) content.  By grouping two caching subsystem data by <br>  performance, you can get the equivalent of a full-page html-cache, but with the ability to <br>  cache fragments. <br><br><h5>  OBJECT CACHES </h5><br>  The object cache lies below the html page cache subsystem.  This cache level serves <i>all Java</i> <i><br></i>  <i>System entities</i> : content objects, user objects, groups, categories, descriptions <br>  content, etc.  An object cache exists above the database cache to avoid reconstructing <br>  objects with each request to the model.  The level is transparent to developers, <br>  it is only necessary to interact with it through the Jahia API if changes to objects are not <br>  entail automatic cache refresh. <br><br><h5>  DATABASE CASH </h5><br>  The last level of the cache is the database level, which <i>minimizes queries to the database</i> . <br>  He is very important.  When working with a database, objects are serialized / deserialized, <br>  load network and system resources so that the overhead of queries to the database can be <br>  very significant.  This cache level is fully implemented by means of the <i>Hibernate ORM</i> . <br><br><h4>  Content Objects </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c1d/558/ca7/c1d558ca793660b8fca4a7220adf3fba.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  List of content objects in Jahia: <br><ul><li>  pages (pages), including content pages, internal and external links; </li><li>  lists of containers of the same type (container lists); </li><li>  containers (contain fields of different types); </li><li>  simple fields and metadata fields (metadata fields can be of various types: <br>  SmallText, BigText, Integer, Date, File reference, etc.). </li></ul><br>  All these objects have common features: <br><ul><li>  they can be divided into categories; </li><li>  access to them can be regulated using access control lists (ACLs); </li><li>  they are described using content description files (content definitions files, cnd- <br>  files); </li></ul><br>  The description file format conforms to the <i>Java Content Repository (JCR)</i> standard <i>for CND files</i> with <br>  adding the following features: <br><ul><li>  multilanguage field values; </li><li>  more accurate input of field types (property types); </li><li>  the ability to specify resources (resource bundle support); </li><li>  choice lists (choice lists); </li><li>  much more ... </li></ul><br>  Content objects are loaded from a database and various cache levels.  They are then transmitted to <br>  a template subsystem in which integrators can finally render a page using <br>  <i>Jahia tag libraries</i> . <br><br><h4>  Portal </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7d7/ef8/362/7d7ef83620b17ffa419f9495d86f2b2a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Jahia includes a portal server based on <i>Apache Pluto</i> - a reference implementation. <br>  Java portlet specifications (JSR-286 Portlet API).  The purpose of Apache Pluto is <br>  <i>enabling integrators to use portlets on pages</i> .  Any portlet, <br>  following standards, can be easily embedded in the Jahia portal.  The figure above shows <br>  various types of portlets that can be used in Jahia. <br><br>  One of the fields of the content object is <i>the application field</i> , which refers to <br>  portlet  This field allows integrators to define a place in a structured web tree. <br>  content where the application may appear.  Portlets can also be categorized and <br>  access to them can be controlled using access control lists. <br><br>  Jahia 6 also uses portlets internally.  Internal portlets can include descriptions <br>  content, they are used to generate different layers of content objects.  <i>Layers</i> in <br>  The portal is used as functional blocks for building web pages.  They can <br>  reused on different pages. <br><br>  This mechanism is called <i>Mashap</i> - the concept of building web applications by <br>  combining the functionality of various software interfaces and data sources.  For <br>  building blocks in the portal server Jahia uses a <i>mashap server (Mashup Server)</i> . <br><br><h4>  Mashup server </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/964/1da/867/9641da867d6bb57193bddb6786147840.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  In the latest versions of Jahia, Javascript has been used more frequently in the system, so to <br>  to identify and reuse mashup on Jahia websites in the portal have included a new <br>  mashap server. <br><br>  Mashup server is built on the portal server, it makes it easy to connect new ones <br>  <i>data sources (mashup types)</i> , simply uploading new portlets to the system.  The picture above <br>  we showed various data sources - mashups: Google Gadgets, YouTube videos, html snippets and <br>  Javascript.  These sources are actually portlet types that include descriptions. <br>  content. <br><br>  According to the description of the content, the user interface will automatically configure and draw <br>  mashup  Site administrators will be able to build mashaps, break them into categories, <br>  restrict access using access control lists and allow content authors to use <br>  them in their sections and in the measures of their competence in the system.  Developers can group mashups <br>  into packages (like ordinary Java portlets) or simply reuse existing ones <br>  portlets, if they meet the needs (for example, the html-mashap is quite common and can be suitable for <br>  many cases).  Mashups can also be imported into the system using import / export functions. <br>  Jahia <br><br>  To improve the system, Jahia developers always look at new technologies with interest.  Standards <br>  for mashaps, they are still being developed, so Jahia will integrate new features <br>  this technology as it develops. <br><br>  Prododdzha read in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/java2ee/81884/">second part</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/81786/">https://habr.com/ru/post/81786/</a></p>
