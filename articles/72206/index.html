      The very essence of the work speaks about the result expressed in the first places / top ten search engines and about any transitions (especially calls) to the site is even out of the question, although it is implied at the stage of selecting keywords for which the site will advance. <br><br>  <b>About transitions to the site, as a result of website promotion</b> <br>  Yes, choosing the right words to promote the Customer‚Äôs site, you can make a calculation of the number of clicks to the site per month when acquiring these positions (it‚Äôs also good to be guided by the calculation of the number of jumps based on data from the Yandex. <br><br>  Calculation for the Customer, expressed in the number of clicks to the site, is better to underestimate of course (even if additional visitors from search engines will be a surprise), especially if conversions are referred to in the contract. <br><br>  <b>About calls to the site, as a result of website promotion in search engines</b> <br>  This is the most interesting! <a name="habracut"></a><br>  If we know the estimated number of transitions to the site, then accordingly we can make a forecast in the number of calls from the site.  How to make it?  How to consider website design?  How to take into account the work of the phone itself and the efficiency of responses to calls by managers?  How to transfer all potential contacts immediately to the call? <br><br>  There are many marketing moves, as well as solutions in website design and solutions in telephony (where each call can be recorded and monitored not only by the Customer, but also by the performer). <br><br>  But what about the promises to the customer by the number of calls? <br>  The only solution found by <a href="http://www.seo-experts.com/">SEO Expert</a> is to use statistics collected from clients (almost none of the company's clients hide it, because they understand that we can do even better!). <br><br>  So: we average the number of transitions to the site from search engines and the number of calls from the site on average in the industry (since there is a lot of work done in various industries) and we will get the figure needed by the potential Customer.  The average figure for all industries turned out to be strangely 5%. <br><br>  Then you can calculate ROI and other economic indicators important to the client!  The bolder, the more data you have collected in the industry (data on customer calls per number of website visitors) and the more accurate word selection you make to promote a customer‚Äôs website (it‚Äôs about query words that best fit the customer‚Äôs service / product and considering the region of sales). <br><br>  When calculating the ROI ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROI">Return On Investment - return on investment</a> ) very beautiful figures are obtained, which is about 10 times the return and more. <br><br>  The data in the article are special cases of calculating the number of calls to the number of visitors (as a result of the work of website promotion in search engines).  Focus on your results of work about which you will be pleased to tell customers and consider ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72206/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72206/</a></p>
