In the process of studying this topic, I became acquainted with excellent guys, who then said: ‚ÄúBut would you like to write your own program for trading and ‚Äî even more interestingly ‚Äî for debugging trading robots‚Äù. <br><br>  No sooner said than done!  After 3 years of development and how many thousands of coffee mugs are unknown, the TSLab program was born. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/87f/13a/3f3/87f13a3f31e4ce92a69577f342853e97.jpg" alt="TSLab">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  A bit of theory </h4><br>  As far as I can tell, TSLab is the first program on the Russian market that allows you to combine the development and optimization of a trading strategy and directly trade on the Russian stock market.  There are several programs that are used today by traders who work in daily work: Wealth-Lab, MetaTrader, Quick, Transac, Alpha Direct and others.  But they all solve only some part of the problem. <br><br><ul><li>  For example, WealthLab is an excellent program for technical analysis.  However, it is not adapted to the Russian market.  Of course, there are attempts to adapt it to real trade on the Russian market, but they are no good both in terms of reliability and speed of transactions. <br></li><li>  MetaTrader - is used by Russian brokers only for trading on Forex. <br></li><li>  Quick, Transac, AlfaDirect are classic trading terminals.  With the help of terminals, you cannot develop and optimize a trading strategy.  And secondly, they do not allow trading in automatic mode.  No, well, that is, of course, they allow something, but it is so peculiar that I am afraid to take risks. <br></li></ul><br><br><h4>  What happened new </h4><br>  When working with TSLab, I do not need to think about some of the usual problems already.  Within the framework of one software, I can both develop a strategy and immediately test it in action.  First, on a demo account, and then on real money.  At the same time, I am spared the need to cross a hedgehog with a snake: a program for technical analysis and a trading terminal with the help of some third laying program.  In this I see a big plus - it‚Äôs clear that the number of errors directly depends on the number of connections. <br><br><h4>  Advantages and disadvantages </h4><br>  Today, when working with the program, I see a small minus: so far, the program works only through one broker.  Namely - through Finam.  As a user, I still want to have a choice.  Still, tariffs, markets, and just the speed of the servers at different brokers are different.  And in the robot-trading, the speed and reliability of the servers at the broker is extremely important.  After talking with the developers, I found out that they were testing the connection to the IT Invest broker, they started developing the connection to the Alor broker.  And in the future is expected to connect to Ceric.  Although of course it would be desirable that in the future the developers did not stop at this and connected other brokers to their program. <br><br>  But there is one big plus in the program in my opinion: when developing algorithms, it is not necessary to study any programming language.  A trading strategy can be constructed in a form resembling a flowchart.  It turns out such visual programming, when I do not need to think about the features of a particular language, but I can focus only on the trading algorithm. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/325/8aa/570/3258aa570bb66c8d5bea9ac7d4218307.gif" alt="Visual editor"><br><br>  But for professionals, you can simply take Visual Studio and write algorithms directly in C # using the open TSLab API. <br><br><h4>  And compote ?! </h4><br>  The program implemented another interesting feature - a scalper glass.  This allows you to place orders, stops and take profits quickly in one click.  Although I'm not a scalper, but ... an exciting experience, I tell you! <br><br><h4>  Instead of conclusion </h4><br>  In conclusion, I would like to say this.  Finally, the first swallow among the trading programs appeared on the Russian market, which, in my opinion, is not inferior to Western counterparts.  Of course, there is still much to develop and improve the program.  But the infrastructure of our brokers is also far from the western level.  In the podcasts of the respected Umputuna, you can often hear how they are fighting for delays in units of milliseconds, in our case - at the level of hundreds of milliseconds with brokers and tens of milliseconds - on exchanges.  And the industry of robot-trade, as such, is practically absent.  21 century in the yard after all!  Let's keep up with the West. <br><br>  <b>Developer site:</b> <a href="http://www.tslab.ru/">www.tslab.ru</a> <br><br>  PS On Habr√©, none of them are not, so it‚Äôs better to ask specific questions from them on the forum <br><br>  <b>UPD</b> Transferred to the ‚ÄúTrading‚Äù blog. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88417/</a></p>
