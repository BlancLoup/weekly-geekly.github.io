  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tt eSPORTS Level 10 M - just a mouse?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> In the life of each person there are things that he prefers to use and give them priority.  Someone does not care about the mouse, but I want an ergonomic keyboard with a soft and silent keystroke.  Give someone excellent speakers, and the rest - do not care.  Well, someone needs everything at once.  I love high-quality peripherals, and I can definitely say that after a good mouse and keyboard, to sit at the mediocre even on the same computer - ‚Äúis no longer a cake‚Äù, nevertheless, we communicate with the piece of iron through input / output devices and main input devices on The PC remains the keyboard and mouse, and not the input and touchscreen. <br><br>  And in the field of muscular affairs there have long been leaders: Razer, Cyborg, Roccat.  Some people like Logitechs (MX Revolution ‚Äî Burum‚Äôs favorite mouse, for example); the A4 Tech with the x7 ruler is a good ‚Äúentry level‚Äù.  But today I want to talk about the product, not just a completely different level, no, this mouse does not feed on the fuel cell and does not hover above the ground in three centimeters, but on a very high-end device that significantly raised my bar ‚ÄúI want‚Äù in terms of quality of work.  Ladies and gentlemen, meet Thermaltake level 10 Mouse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/055/8c6/846/0558c6846de7a5c521aa123cb00a8f48.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In my hands - an engineering sample in a green "military" color (although I would call it Halo-Style).  In a couple of months, such a mouse will appear on the shelves in as many as three colors (white, black, green), changes in the device itself are no longer foreseen, the maximum that will change is the box.  I have it small and gray, without any identification marks, but on igromir I took the release version, but, unfortunately, the truth let the memory card down and had to go to the ThermalTake office and take a picture of the release samples there.  Due to this, in the post there are more interesting photos and mice in three colors, instead of one.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d9/354/b43/2d9354b43fe61b72707a71507117af66.jpg"><br><br>  Inside the box is the mouse itself, the hexagon for it (shape setting) and, in fact, pimply polyethylene.  The current version contains a complete set - a convenient box, drivers, a ‚Äúbag‚Äù for a mouse, and generally looks beautiful: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c55/b8d/784/c55b8d7847ac05ca3944b1863c1e5c9e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9ef/a62/341/9efa62341234edbc785061ff10effa9a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f9b/a0e/6ef/f9ba0e6ef9c1b2bedee2170ad197344e.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d1/5a6/ea3/7d15a6ea3913eb32af95105ec0b4131a.jpg"><br><br>  ThermalTake positions the device as a game (and therefore comparisons with the ‚Äúmasters‚Äù of this sphere cannot be avoided), and the design for this mouse was developed in the bowels of the BMW Design Group, and although the mouse does not carry the branded colors of the Bavarian flag or ‚Äúnostrils‚Äù, but the style and workmanship - at the height.  There are not so many parallels with other products from the level 10 line, but who knows, maybe there is also a keyboard, a gamepad or a steering wheel in the same style.  Although, the steering wheel from the BMW Design Group, I hope, will be in a more BMW's theme.  ;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7fe/186/13d/7fe18613de43a5ed0ed86e4704093466.jpg"><br><br>  So, if we talk about appearance, then it is at least ambiguous.  There are no smooth bends and cunning forms of Razer'a, and there is no freedom of customization and unusual appearance of Cyborg RAT'a.  This mouse is rather an unusual symbiosis of straight and curved lines, a strict hexagonal grid and rounded corners.  Smoothness and clarity.  Nobody had a similar ‚Äúambiguity‚Äù in the style, but Level 10 Mouse does not look assembled from random parts, despite the different stylistics of some elements.  Rather, there is an organic complement of some other features. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/883/b32/8a8/883b328a860b0f7aab5c5d34c0ee17a4.jpg"><br><br>  It is difficult to describe with words such a design - the mouse MUST be picked up and understood, ‚Äúyour‚Äù is or ‚Äúnot yours‚Äù.  A neat metal bottom, a light contoured ‚Äúbody‚Äù that supports the palm, almost straight keys, a neat black stripe, a pleasant wheel and unusual shapes of the side keys are neatly assembled into a solid and solid image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/58a/b27/954/58ab27954bb31d442902cbedc01bd20c.jpg"><br><br>  You take in your hand, and you understand - a thing.  This.  A nice bonus is the variable geometry of the mouse without the need to change the modules - the ‚Äútilt‚Äù of the surface and the ‚Äúheight‚Äù of the reference point are adjusted with a hexagonal head screw.  That is why the ‚Äúkey‚Äù comes with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/902/61b/e96/90261be967e5150dd169418f7b027ed7.jpg"><br><br>  But how does the geometry change: <br><br>  1) Left-right: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9b8/053/c78/9b8053c783e39374d6c7a3742b93d7bb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/651/a69/774/651a697740206a9ab0c4093f3915b8fa.jpg"><br><br>  2) Up-down: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a0a/6d8/079/a0a6d80790d0ba5f6584af6667c2d2bc.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/171/58e/631/17158e6311d1a0005dac5a79857b39c2.jpg"><br><br>  Two mice on the ‚Äúopposite‚Äù settings: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/902/61b/e96/90261be967e5150dd169418f7b027ed7.jpg"><br><br>  The configuration of the mouse is fairly standard.  The relatively symmetrical case allows you to use the mouse either left-handed or right-handed, however, priority is given to right-handed users, like most: LKM is slightly larger than the PCM, and on the left side, in addition to two additional keys (performing the function back and forth), there is a mini-joystick, responsible (by default) for switching profiles and dynamic adjustment of DPI on each of the profiles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/066/e40/420/066e40420fee70342e10eb7da06afb25.jpg"><br><br>  The right side is poorer - there are only 2 buttons on it (analogue ‚Äúforward-backward‚Äù), which are responsible for opening the configurator and launching the macro.  Not the most convenient location for the "right-handed" user, so, rather, it is a way to make the mouse "two-handed" and the ability to hang on these buttons "forward" and "back."  Actually, I don‚Äôt see any point in describing the appearance in detail - there are a million photos in the post and everything is visible on them, and what‚Äôs not obvious enough is already described.  You can safely go to the most important part of the mouse - work. <br><br>  You know, when you switch from a cheap device to a higher-level piece of hardware, you don‚Äôt feel like back.  Turning from the usual ‚Äúknowame‚Äù of ‚Äú200 re‚Äù junk, at least on the A4Tech x7 Series, you don't want to go back to a regular mouse.  Turning from ‚ÄúaFotecha‚Äù to ‚ÄúRazer‚Äù it becomes truly incomprehensible how you lived before.  I have a ‚ÄúMamba‚Äù (I adore this mouse, to be honest), but now I am completely at a loss.  The flagship product of the past-last year seems to be a kind of "aFotech."  Completely different level of performance.  All cursor movements are so predictable and accurate that you simply don‚Äôt want to give up the mouse. <br><br>  One gets the impression that now in the hands is a scalpel, and before that I used, at best, a kitchen knife.  Ordinary mice - the dull stone axes of Neanderthals.  I cannot express in words (although I really want) the sensations from the transfer of the movement of the hand to the movement of the cursor.  Some process far-fetchedness disappeared, if earlier (as it seemed to me) using the mouse was brought to the utmost automatism, now I just don‚Äôt feel the difference between thinking ‚Äúcursor here‚Äù and action.  Steve Jobs was to present this mouse, with his signature Awesome-Amazing-New Experience-Unbelievable-Really Efficient and corresponding charisma.  Meet The New iPhone 5 Level 10 Mouse. <br><br>  If you believe the promotional materials - in the mouse is a sensor that can work with a resolution of 8200DPI.  I do not know why such cosmic values ‚Äã‚Äãare needed, but apparently the sensor is really good.  Personally, I don't use more than 4200, in spite of the 27 ‚Äùmonitor with a resolution of 2560x1440 and the‚Äú slow ‚Äùcursor in Windows.  It may be easier for someone to move the mouse a couple of centimeters and move the cursor from the edge of one monitor to the opposite edge of another, but how to get into intermediate values ‚Äã‚Äãwith such sensitivity is a mystery.  I found another use for such high resolutions of the sensor: set the minimum comfortable speed of movement programmatically (in Windows or games, if they override the system settings) and select the most comfortable value of the cursor moving speed by adjusting the DPI on the mouse itself.  This little trick allows you to achieve a good balance between the speed of the cursor and its positioning accuracy, without suffering from the ‚Äúmad cursor‚Äù syndrome, or from the inability to move the pointer literally 1-2-3 or how many pixels you need to get right on target or precisely Move the ruler in Photoshop. <br><br>  To the mouse is a proprietary driver that allows you to create macros and edit embedded profiles (up to five pieces).  Each profile can have its own backlight color (there are seven of them), its own DPI step settings and its own macros on additional buttons.  Actually, this is where the software ends.  Oh, I almost forgot, there is still a built-in bundle of promo videos that open in the system video viewer, and 2/3 of the video itself is occupied by useless screen savers.  Same.  The very same description of features in promotional videos of very dubious quality, I would remove this part (video) from the software entirely. <br><br>  Okay, we talked about the beautiful, now we need to pour a little bit of tar into this bath of honey. <br>  1) software is crooked.  No, it is not something that works poorly, it performs its functions.  But the appearance and intuitiveness of the interface leave not only the best, but the dismissal of the designer and the UX-specialist.  I would like to see the mouse settings screen at the Razer level (or better, native and convenient, but on the developers' conscience). <br>  2) The location of the ‚Äúforward‚Äù button, in my opinion, is a bit far from comfortable values.  But the button "back" constantly accidentally hurt, until you get used to it. <br>  3) The inability to reassign the functions of the "joystick".  Not such a strong minus, but I would like to manage its functions. <br>  4) The mouse does not turn on the backlight after the computer goes to sleep.  Restarting the software or reconnecting the mouse to the USB port helps, which is not good.  Reported, they promised to fix it, a new firmware was released, the bug was fixed. <br><br>  What we have in the bottom line? <br>  1) Excellent quality of work.  LKM and PKM are pressed exactly with the effort with which they should.  It is difficult to explain, but it becomes instantly clear as soon as you take the mouse in your hand.  No random clicks (thoughtful or careless).  Very accurate work as the buttons themselves, and their preload. <br>  2) Mouse wheel.  Excellent, clear, dry and 100% informative divisions.  The wheel of the "Mamba" after it seems to be smeared semolina on a plate.  Very nice tactile feedback and surface; <br>  3) Adjustment of the angle of inclination (left-right) and the height of the reference point (under the base of the palm).  Without replacement parts or linings.  Simple, reliable, modern and stylish; <br>  4) Nice appearance.  Some people like white, some people like black, I like green most of all, although the others are very good-looking; <br>  5) Awesome accuracy with the cursor.  It's just something indescribable, you have to try it once.  True, then you will want to throw out your current mouse for ‚Äúclumsiness‚Äù and ‚Äújumping‚Äù; <br>  6) Customizable lights - one of six colors or "battle mode" (color change depending on the intensity of interaction with a rodent).  It's nice that you can choose one of the popular colors, the color of the backlight of the keyboard or system unit; <br>  7) Excellent cable in a tight braided sheath.  Just a nice little thing; <br>  8) So-so software (otreportil a huge roll of developers, I hope to take note); <br>  9) The position of the side buttons requires a habit or retraining after other mice (it is treated by time). <br>  Conclusion?  Everyone makes a conclusion himself, but for now it is one of the best mice with which I spoke.  Many thanks to Tt eSports and specifically <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/dedal/" class="user_link">Dedal</a> for the pleasant hours with this amazing device.  Be sure to buy myself this. <br><br>  ps: By the way, the mouse has a ‚Äúvirgin sticker‚Äù, so if you bought one, and it doesn't work, check the bottom.  ;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0bc/9a6/685/0bc9a66855acd499b61a94ea2458014c.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154579/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154579/</a></p>
