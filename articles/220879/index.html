It all started with the book of one of the coaches for this type of change of consciousness.  The book, contrary to expectations, had its effect and soon I experienced the OS.  Although, as I understand now, this was more likely due to naivety in the subject, teenage impressionability, and the fact that the first part of the book is devoted entirely to the reader's motivation.  Those.  the author tells the most colorful about all the alleged advantages of the OS (starting with a jump in personal development at rocket speed, ending with access to unlimited information, etc., etc.).  The jump in development did not seem to work out, and it was only ten times possible to fly to the ‚Äúphase‚Äù.  From myself I can say, the quality of sensations is really <blockquote>  120% and higher </blockquote>  . <br><br>  For those, then decide to try - small recommendations for beginners: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  Start with the "indirect" technician!  In fact, at first they will <u>only</u> give results. </li><li>  The main thing is to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù and remember the feeling that precedes the OS, the so-called Sleep paralysis (numbness of the whole body and slight vibration along it).  If you remember this feeling the next time returning to the ‚Äúphase‚Äù will be much easier, even using direct techniques </li></ul><br><h4>  I was lost ¬© Gadya </h4><br>  In this topic I still wanted to share my discovery, which <u>actually</u> helps in life from a practical point of view. <br><br>  I'll start again from afar.  I have two problems in my life - laziness and bad memory.  In principle, this is a story about how the first won the second. <br><br>  All that is described below is extremely subjective and is based on a poor description of sensations, which may differ depending on the characteristics of the individual. <br><br>  Being an extremely lazy person, I practiced the phase before bedtime, trying to get into it through direct techniques.  By itself, by virtue of lack of experience, I did not achieve the goal.  In the process, I often noticed that after prolonged relaxation, ‚Äúflying‚Äù, ‚Äúnot getting‚Äù to the state of the ‚Äúphase‚Äù I was still thrown into a state other than wakefulness and drowsiness.  It was characterized by increased performance of the imagination, and increased ability to concentrate.  For example, focusing on the event that took place in my life a year ago, I could remember in detail what I was wearing, what I was drinking, eating, how much it cost.  The details themselves are specified depending on the immersion in the state and the time that has been conducted in it, up to the smells, the headlines of the day, etc.  Here I want to introduce the term, let's be "State of Increased Concentration".  Practically, the SEC helped me find the silver chain that I lost when I moved.  In theory, in this way, you can <u>remember</u> anything you want - a conversation that took place several months, even years ago, where certain lost things lie, etc.  I increasingly use this method to experience any event in my life. <br><br><h5>  For those who want to try </h5><br>  All my recommendations below are quite subjective, something may not work, something you will feel, perceive in a completely different way, but in general they should suit everyone. <br><br>  For practice it is better to choose the day before the weekend, because  in the morning there may be a broken state.  Lie down in an uncomfortable position (for me, the pose works like a soldier on my back, hands at the seams, works smoothly. Then you just lie down and do not move, do not move at all. In the process, think about the event that you will remember. on average, it takes from five to 20 minutes. What you get into a state you will understand right away - as if from a pipe in an aquapark with overclocking fell into a huge ocean. The most important feeling is that the darkness before your eyes will expand dramatically, as if from a dark room, where nothing is visible you are in the same dark simple  anstvo, but without borders If you are in doubt -. hit the state or not - so do not fall after this visualization turns to complete, you can immediately do what is intended.. <br><br><h5>  Eventually </h5><br>  Below I will try to limit myself to just a few of theses: <br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  Enter SPK is much easier than in OS </li><li>  You can recall important information for any reason, for example, a long-forgotten account password </li><li>  You can find lost things. </li><li>  Can be nostalgic with ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù immersion.  Want to relive meaningful, vibrant life events? </li></ul><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  The state is less comfortable than the OS - to lie 1,2 rarely - 3 hours in the same pose, in the mind, it can be tiring (and sometimes the nose itches) </li><li>  You can not use the SEC "promptly" i.  if you are trying to find car keys hidden from the evening, in the morning, in a hurry to work - this will not help you </li><li>  Insomnia - after you lasted an hour in the SEC - it will be very difficult to sleep.  I have time to fall asleep after an average session of SEC from 30 minutes to an hour. </li></ul><br>  It turned out a bit messy, so I will be happy to answer any questions, see feedback, ideas on the application of this practice. <br>  Thank you for reading the time and attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/220879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/220879/</a></p>
