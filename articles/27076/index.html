  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Fresh air 2.0</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>Water</strong> <br><br>  Reading Habr, I very often come across the desire of people to give up everything, go to hell and work there.  Half a day, a week, a year, until the end of life - someone like.  Some succeeded, some dream, but in reality not many are ready to do this - after all, their own skin is closest to the body, and there you can stay without a skin at all. <br><br>  On the other hand, a lot of people strive in the opposite direction - the conquest of a concrete river, then a large iron, then a third transport, etc.  It is also not surprising - the deeper into the center, the more salary, faster the Internet, more events.

      But something tells me that harmony is somewhere near, somewhere at the junction of these two concepts. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>IMHO</strong> <br><br>  I live in Moscow.  There is really a very bad environment, noisy, a lot of people and all the time some kind of strange gray sky overhead.  Last year, I discovered a very interesting fact - it turns out that already 100 km from Moscow the sky is noticeably bluer and the air enters the lungs much easier. <br><br>  Since then, the desire to dump me in the region of the 100th kilometer and work from there has not left me.  And for this there are all prerequisites.  And I can easily do this, but only one thing stops: the desire to squeeze the maximum out of this event. <br><br>  <strong>Rhetoric</strong> <br><br>  You considered how much money is spent on meals in Moscow, how much is on transport, most importantly, how much money does a dough leave to rent an apartment?  How much time does it take to lift, body delivery to work, otkison after traffic jams / subway, the work itself, again traffic jams / subway and departure from the way back?  How much time after this remains on ‚ÄúPersonal Life‚Äù until the moment when the body asks to sleep?  According to my observations, this time can be neglected - anyway, an IT specialist spends it sitting at the computer at home. <br><br>  <strong>Idea</strong> <br><br>  In general, there is an idea to rent a cottage (one or several nearby - depending on the number of applicants) 100 from Moscow with all amenities such as water, heat, sewage and electricity for the period from mid-autumn to mid-spring.  Then stick a plate with satellite Internet there, hire granny from the locals to cook and clean.  In this house you can live and work at the same time. <br><br>  You can work either in some common area (for example, equip the first floor for work, live on the second), or in your own rooms.  If you type a lot of people - you can take a separate house for work.  Someone from my friends spoke out for the fact that it is necessary to separate the house and work physically, although I do not really agree. <br><br>  As restrictions: a closed area (the entrance yard is not suitable - today your mother came to you for a couple of hours, friends will come to the neighbor tomorrow until Monday), ‚Äúface and soul‚Äù control - colleagues should not only be professionals in their work, they should create a pleasant atmosphere and do not strain each other. <br><br>  <strong>How to work</strong> <br><br>  IMHO the most correct and simple solution is the team working on a common IT project, which will have a manager-manager who can kick workers and periodically go to meetings with the customer, buying everything necessary for life along the way.  Another question is how to find such a team and such a project%) <br><br>  <strong>What is left over</strong> <br><br>  Pros: a lot of health (food, air, wood, sports, sauna), strong nerves (traffic jams, metro and office environment kill anyone), more dough (much lower costs for housing, renting an office, though more costs for the Internet and slower connect), more time for privacy (saving 5-6 hours of transport time), more ideas on the project, the opportunity after a working day to swell with colleagues in the office without worrying about the way back, etc. <br><br>  The minuses are clear - up to Moscow and back, 500-600 rubles of gasoline costs, 1.5 hours before the Moscow Ring Road, no familiar civilization (cinema, pharmacy, round-the-clock supermarket at the entrance ...) and probably something else. <br><br>  <strong>Questions</strong> <br><br>  To fool such a thing is not so difficult.  Another thing is to find such an order that would require so much time for execution, and be ready (that is, have a team and a rented room) before the start of the project.  Accordingly, I have a few questions: <br><br>  * Are you ready to give up the usual way of life and fall down ‚Äúto work in the country‚Äù? <br>  * Are you able to tolerate the same strangers next to you? <br>  * Is it possible for you to work in the same place where you live? <br>  * Does anyone need this other than me? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27076/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27076/</a></p>
