  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The year of outsourcing or the first real job</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello Megamind!  I decided to tell my story of the provincial non-success with big ambitions.  Under the cut I will tell about 12 months of my life. <br><br>  In the courtyard in May 2012.  I am a third-year student of the Faculty of Mathematics, who does not understand at all why he is studying.  The basics of C ++, PHP, HTML do not give any sense, independent lessons are always held in order to earn and to the detriment of learning.  Having suffered for three years - I made a decision, with study while I finish.  I am taking documents, making a resume, going to a large Moscow company that has opened an office in the province.  I was interested in the position of SEO-specialist, I have experience, support in the person of more experienced people is present. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Three interviews.  The first is a preliminary.  A brief conversation with HR, a note in the resume sheet ‚Äúyes‚Äù, welcome to the second stage.  The second interview in 2-3 days - a meeting with the CEO and Director of Marketing.  The third interview by phone is the technical director.  Total - about 5 days, we get an offer, there is work.  At the end of May we leave the office. <br><br>  New office, air conditioning, furniture, tea, coffee and other amenities.  Paphos, in the form of races to the office of deputies, rectors and other leaders.  Constant seminars on corporate ethics and other overseas things.  All direct management is located in Moscow, in the provinces only HR and the general director, managers of securities.  As a result, on paper, we work for a subsidiary, which is located in the province.  Periodically send reports on the work done in the MSC, after which we get the money.

      Further, the whole cycle of work is divided into 4 stages. <br><br>  1. June - August.  The company has just started to work on technology outsourcing.  Relationship is not established, a lot of misunderstandings.  Feel free to ask, find out, advise.  Constantly on the phone with the marketing director, we evaluate indicators, costs ... In terms of the atmosphere, everything is on the rise, salary growth, career advancement, medical insurance are promised (which is rare for us).  At the office there is a constant movement - new people come, big people come from the MSC, communicate with employees, everything is nice and fun.  Communication with Moscow is intended to be carried out via Skype in negotiations, where on TV we get a terrible sound and picture.  Our project immediately decided to switch to regular mobile communications, without this unnecessary interference.  Often, employees ride to Moscow, pay for a hotel, delight in meeting new people.  We get a good experience, develop. <br><br>  2. September - December.  Launch our project.  The first months of work are hard, because  constantly having problems.  The atmosphere in the project is excellent - no one is cut, we are young and strong.  In the office, everything is much more complicated - slowly reducing staff, some savings begin.  It becomes clear that not everything is so smooth.  Nevertheless, we go to Moscow, meet with leaders, discuss problems.  By the way, the team building seminars were not in vain - now we have cakes, gifts and greetings for every birthday and major holiday. <br><br>  3. January - March.  We work closely.  Already resembles a small routine.  Seminars evaporated, just working.  In the office they are wondering - when will we close?  They talk louder that everything is flawed and does not work as it should. <br><br>  4. April - May.  The atmosphere is hot!  Cuts and savings in the office.  Work in the project is stable, but the office is kept on the brink.  Sometimes there are encouraging moments, but they are very insignificant.  Mid May - we close.  At the same time, the closure occurred at lightning speed - on one day the board of directors makes a decision to close the office, we receive calculations within a week and run away. <br><br>  The result - most of the employees are forced to look for work again.  I have kept my work in the project, largely due to the well-established relationship with the leaders in Moscow.  I remember how worried I was before the interviews.  All the fault of the pathos with which everything was organized.  It seemed - the company of the beyond the level where it will be difficult to work.  But you can't judge a book by its cover.  Having a little rummaged in behind-the-scenes affairs, it became clear - we have an ordinary company with an abundance of investments, but with no experienced leaders able to choose what needs to be developed and what isn't.  I think almost every reader is able to understand: what company are we talking about?  In no case do I regret this year of work - new acquaintances and knowledge have been obtained. <br><br>  ps I decided to receive education in absentia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293044/</a></p>
