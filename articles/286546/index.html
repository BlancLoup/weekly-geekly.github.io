As a rule, one of the ‚Äúold-timers‚Äù of the project who had a hand in many components and only he knows how these parts work together.  Virtually "unbearable" from the project, or without it, everything starts to "work somehow wrong."  For any question, "how it works," it always answers, "Yes, it's easier for me to gash myself," and gash. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b><a href="http://design-pattern.ru/patterns/registry.html">Registry</a> developer</b> <br>  Like singleton, this is an old-time developer, however, unlike him, he doesn‚Äôt know the implementation details, but he knows that the component exists in principle.  Often, it serves as a ‚Äúlive reference book‚Äù and can answer any question about the code where to look at how this is done. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_(%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD_%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F)">Factory</a> developer</b> <br>  Developer in a web studio.  At the entrance often receives several parameters, such as the finished layout and a couple of pictures, and at the output gives a business card site or another online store.  As a rule, over time, it tends to reduce the number of parameters at the input in order to increase the speed of work, or even to automate the process.
