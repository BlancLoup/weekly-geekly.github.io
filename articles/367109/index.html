Did not happen.  The uniaxial ‚Äústanding‚Äù Segway electric scooter never became a mass product.  There are many reasons for this, and the unusual character of this method of transportation played a significant role.  Many years have passed since then, Segway was bought by the Chinese and continues to produce scooters of the same name. <br><br>  Naturally, businessmen from the South-East soon offered their variants of segways, already under other brands.  And the name itself has become a household name for this type of vehicle.  And let the Segway products not become globally popular, but it is a pioneer who formed in the mass consciousness the image of a uniaxial electric scooter - and at the same time laid a track for a not so massive but separate market.  And today we want to talk about two interesting models of uniaxial electric scooters, which slowly but steadily penetrate the cities, offering an alternative to bicycles. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Both devices are made by the Chinese company Inmotion.  This is a fairly strong manufacturer, producing quite high-quality products.  In particular, we consider their Segway with wheels of small diameter and the so-called monowheel.  And both devices have their own interesting features.

Do not be confused by the term "monowheel" - the wheels here are two, they are just located very close to each other.  If you like, you can call it one, but wide wheel.  This solution gives the device better stability.  V3 is easy to learn, you can confidently move around it after 15-20 minutes of practice.  Not masterly, of course, but quite understanding how to do it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/416/b78/085/416b78085f3145bc82e7167a5cecff9f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/11f/1fe/476/11f1fe476fda4b9687dbb83fccfe52b8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/430/4e3/fd3/4304e3fd3b3a4ec7a12d948056db6e11.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b45/e56/581/b45e56581c194085b4f411f2d1468146.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52c/b1b/6db/52cb1b6dbaa14da2b3ad6d2c86bfa431.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f04/121/6eb/f041216eb9794fe38d88afee987e83a4.jpg"><br><br>  There are soft inserts on the sides, so that the shins are comfortable, the steps are made corrugated, the soles do not slide over them.  The monowheel is equipped with small headlights and taillights.  For easy transportation, a retractable handle is provided, with which the device can be transported as a suitcase on wheels.  At the same time, the V3 automatically holds the vertical application and goes there where you direct it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a9/a18/164/5a9a181646b943468e349ebf4c80c84d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ae7/fc5/7f6/ae7fc57f693a4ba9962171662d19e1c5.jpg"><br><br>  Also on the side is the touch panel on and the connector for the charger.  To charge the V3, it is enough to have access to the most common 220V outlet. If necessary, you can use it through the converter to the car cigarette lighter.  A full battery charge lasts for 25 kilometers.  In most cases, this is enough to get to the place of work.  And many users will not even have to recharge V3 for the return journey. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c1/22c/723/4c122c72362644cdb05c98fab7de2f78.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd4/059/1c4/dd40591c48fd4860953527af8152d3ab.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0c/93d/b8f/e0c93db8f0e84f8fa6d740d56131a7ae.jpg"><br><br>  V3 has a maximum speed of 18 km / h.  Quite an interesting feeling, despite not the highest speed performance.  The maximum load is 120 kg.  Do not pay attention to the fact that the V3 looks pretty fragile, this is a deceptive impression.  Even with a maximum load of the dynamics of the monowheel does not change.  Stability on the road is good, the dynamics and maneuvering are smooth, but quick, the reaction to the change of the center of gravity of the ‚Äúrider‚Äù is vigorous. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/073/abf/921/073abf9212054b91806d7250b78710c2.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f73/44b/205/f7344b2055fd4a24bf5f99a2b6c25e91.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7da/981/e92/7da981e921aa47dd922033f5c09bb5ce.jpg"><br><br>  The manufacturer equipped the V3 with a rather amusing feature - a Bluetooth module and a speaker, thanks to which the mono-wheel can helpfully play your favorite music transmitted from a smartphone.  On the other hand, no one is surprised that some motorcycles have built-in acoustics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc2/b4f/cd2/dc2b4fcd24c44cdfb93ce736cf5ef332.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Segway Inmotion R2 </h1><br><h4>  Main characteristics </h4><br><ul><li>  Speed: 15 km / h </li><li>  Load: 120 kg </li><li>  Power reserve: 30 km </li><li>  Max.  lifting angle: 24 degrees </li><li>  Dimensions: 460 x 490 x 1440 mm </li><li>  Wheel size: 200 mm </li><li>  Weight (without packaging): 16.5 kg </li><li>  Max.  load: 120 kg </li><li>  Price - 140 000 rubles </li></ul><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5PX26f_h4k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiKdgZYElmLUj-Y7zLYyMBHdIJLLw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/505/7f8/89b/5057f889bf3e46f484aa0b135e3bdc05.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6c/763/133/b6c763133d564646a87a0cfc68ff97f8.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79c/88a/c09/79c88ac09eee4498a36b0c1d4475e641.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8d/af3/d33/a8daf3d330f34fa7aa8677bb0c45984e.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/567/051/6b8/5670516b8ac0442494007f52215f2ef2.jpg"><br><br>  This is a more familiar device.  Inmotion R2 has just entered production, and so far it can only be purchased on preorder.  This is a purely urban model, small wheels practically do not allow using R2 in nature.  On the other hand, the device turned out very compact. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ef/c79/30e/8efc7930efa545618cf27039c9277c89.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c26/da8/fe8/c26da8fe8d904c6784acc92fe2f2fc9d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/64b/716/d69/64b716d699df4e3b87d793d10584778e.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/124/e43/5d7/124e435d71a9466dbf1095f83d2b2b9b.jpg"><br><br>  As in the case of V3, the learning curve is very steep here, the device is ready for use practically out of the box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d36/488/2c2/d364882c2852408ab4491a42471a7c3f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a44/7ce/c12/a447cec12f1a401ca8016f25f9af4d0f.jpg"><br><br>  Basic control commands (choice of driving mode, turns) are given by tilting the steering column.  In addition, the device is able to interact quite closely with mobile devices, however, a non-localized sample with limited functionality was provided for testing.  In the serial devices will be implemented the ability to fully manage the segway directly from the smartphone.  You can also read and set the route by GPS-coordinates, download the statistics of the device and even search for other R2, located nearby.  And just like in V3, Bluetooth module and speakers are integrated into Segway.  Also, the device is equipped with USB and microUSB connectors, so you can charge your gadgets directly from the segway.  Mobile application for managing segway is available in versions for Android and iOS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/62d/d37/be4/62dd37be48424599b6104b9ac6af076d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68f/3b7/e4e/68f3b7e4e6774ffdbb1f384673bd54ec.jpg"><br><br>  We knowingly mentioned the possibility of specifying the route.  Segway is able to independently stick to him, while he identifies the obstacles in his path and tries to go around them.  Included is an infrared remote control, which segway can follow closely, so that it can be used as a small cargo platform.  If you intend to give R2 to your children, then you can program the boundaries for which he refuses to leave and just stop. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cff/e98/381/cffe98381a3f4dac94f4343e129f0413.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcc/445/450/dcc4454509514d69a949f58a60913486.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dbe/580/0a1/dbe5800a132e400fb2936721c3e9a562.jpg"><br><br>  Headlights and side lights are also available, and the device itself comes in different colors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f5/546/03e/0f554603e37f437894841fe79015dfcb.jpg"><br><br>  The handle is detached, but not folded, which increases the convenience of transporting the segway in the trunk.  If desired, it can and simply carry, if you are not confused by 16.5 kg of live weight.  For comparison, a full-fledged segway with large wheels weighs under 50 kg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/063/6b6/a3d/0636b6a3dd64410d8546fd9fa570f931.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/704/eef/0c7/704eef0c70a2434096bd549d623b2995.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2d/3a5/36e/c2d3a536e580443d8ca7c6e1047e0ddf.jpg"><br><br>  The maximum speed of 15 km / h, power reserve - 30 km.  The battery charges to maximum for three hours.  Although the patency is low, but you can learn to freely manage R2 in just a couple of minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2d0/f89/2a6/2d0f892a62ea47958624d9b1fc309995.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1><br>  Despite the user friendliness, compactness and simplicity, both devices are unlikely to blow up the market.  The reason for this is commonplace - the cost.  So far, segway and monowheel can hardly be called a mass product.  Nevertheless, with the growth of production volumes the price will fall - and the volumes will grow, we have no doubts about that.  Of course, such devices will not succeed in driving out bicycles, but they will occupy their niche. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/624/b97/a85/624b97a8577b4694bbd1c2134c4fec2f.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367109/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367109/</a></p>
