  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Managerial fights - technology managers training, assessment tool and sport</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The insurance company, making out the policy, made a mistake in my documents.  Having found it, the employee recalculated the amount and demanded an additional payment of 10 thousand.  If this happened two or three years ago, I would be convinced, worried.  Or just paid.  Now I calmly asked only two questions, and the policy was issued to me with new data at the same price.  What helped me? <br><br><h4>  My hobbies </h4><br>  My name is Alexander Sadovsky and for the past fifteen years I have been working as a manager and manager.  At first everything was fine.  Project management skills, expertise and common sense were enough to solve all the issues.  But at some point, when I was already working at Yandex, with the growth of the scale of tasks and the number of employees, I began to increasingly encounter situations that it was not clear how to approach.  Gradually, I realized that I didn‚Äôt have enough managerial experience - making difficult decisions, managing a team, resolving conflict situations.  I began to read a lot, learn and soon discovered a new topic for myself - management fights. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb0/492/2b2/eb04922b2dbc29c1be0f7301c80ae366.jpg" alt="The picture of the world of other people is full of surprises">

      It was difficult to take the first step at the negotiating table.  This is stressful.  And when there were spectators, the fights acquired a special glow.  But I managed and in half a year I began to participate in tournaments, and soon I won.  For example, in 2011 and 2013, he became the winner of the Moscow open tournament in fast managerial struggle, in 2012 and 2013 he won the Autumn Cup of Moscow in the classical managerial struggle. <br><br>  And the more I immersed myself in this hobby, the more subtle nuances of situations and managerial moves I learned to see, the more important it seemed to me to share this.  And I found time, good, there is a reason. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Who and why </h4><br>  The skill of successfully solving complex and conflict situations is useful both in work and in everyday life.  If you communicate with salespeople and officials, you probably have friction, or even real fights.  Either they do not want to cut the sausage, or they strive to write out a fine.  There are delicate situations with friends and relatives.  But most of these situations are found in managerial practice. <br><br>  Cooperate great.  But conflicts and struggles also occur in collaboration.  Why?  Everyone understands goals and ways of achieving them in their own way.  Resources one for all.  Conflicts, believe me, are inevitable, something else is important.  They are constructive when they help to solve a problem better, but they are destructive - for example, when the disputants become personal.  The ability to fight for the result, and not against the person allows you to find balanced solutions and maintain relationships. <br><br>  As you guessed, the ability to conduct fights can be learned.  Learn to achieve results and remain a positive hero.  Technology Vladimir Tarasov "Managerial duel" allows you to assess which of the two players better resolved the conflict situation.  And to explain whose decisions are more promising, whose form of negotiations is more successful and why. <br><br><h4>  Technology </h4><br>  What is this technology?  There is a large base of conflict situations in the lives of managers and managers, owners and just everyday ones.  As a rule, they have three to five stakeholders.  There are two players.  Each has five minutes to resolve the situation and agree.  To do this, you can choose any pair of roles, one for yourself, the other for your opponent.  The result is evaluated by nine judges who represent three boards. <br><br>  The first is ‚Äúhiring people‚Äù.  An image that is given to the judges: <i>‚ÄúImagine that you have been interviewed at two very similar divisions of a company, received two identical job offers.</i>  <i>Only leaders are different.</i>  <i>And here you are lucky: you saw how they resolve the conflict situation within 10 minutes.</i>  <i>Who would you like to hire? ‚Äù</i> And then everyone weighs.  This head is tougher, but behind him is like a stone wall.  Ready to take responsibility for yourself.  And the other is bargaining for every penny, you won't interrogate salary increases.  And he speaks haughtily - I don‚Äôt want to be so reprimanded.  Criteria dozens, as in life. <br>  The second board - "guides to the negotiations."  The image is similar, you need to conduct extremely important negotiations, but you cannot go to them, and you need to send someone in your place.  First or second? <br>  The third board is "those who trust property."  If you need to leave for a long time and entrust your business (division) to someone, who will it be from the players?  Who better to save?  Who multiplies?  Who will not deceive?  There is an easy way to present yourself on the site of the judges of this board.  Imagine that you trust the keys to your apartment to someone who will be looking for tenants for several years, borrow money for you, repair in case of bays or other natural problems, settle disputes with neighbors.  Who do you entrust the keys to the first or second player? <br>  Three colleges reflect three vectors of management decisions.  How good a player is for people - as a leader, a colleague;  how well he keeps the goal, while maintaining control and management;  How protects the interests of business and owners. <br><br>  It would seem that a simple solution - three boards of judges.  But it is this triad that makes it possible to identify those who are not only effective, but also striving to be a positive hero.  Sometimes you may encounter a stereotype that ‚Äúfights‚Äù, ‚Äústruggle‚Äù is something from the ‚Äúcrush, trample, categorically insist on your own‚Äù series.  Fortunately, to achieve long-term success in life and fights, we must act differently.  And it's easy to see why.  Would you hire a job to a manager who seeks to crush people?  Me not.  Would you send such a person to negotiate?  It‚Äôs definitely not a long-term partner, but one-time ones is a big question, because the reputation may suffer.  Would you entrust ownership to someone difficult to negotiate?  No, management would become a constant controversy and push-ups of property.  Of course, there is a stage of maturation, when beginners think that the louder and more categorical, the better.  This usually goes pretty quickly.  The better the management on both sides, the less the struggle. <br><br>  In addition to the evaluation component in the technology there is an educational one.  The judges give a detailed comment on why they made such a decision, than the decisions of the first player at the table differed from the decisions of the second.  This allows you to look at yourself from the outside, to understand what skills you need to pull up and next time consciously think about problem points.  The judges do not know your success in work or school.  They see and hear only what happens during a duel.  They are not interested in success or in the defeat of a particular player.  Comments from experienced but impartial judges allow us to understand a lot about myself. <br>  In a sense, the nine judges are a cross-section of society.  Every year the environment is slowly but steadily changing, and the socially desirable image of the leader is changing.  If in the nineties, assertiveness and tenacity were important, the ability to think systematically, take responsibility, and build long-term relationships now comes to the fore.  It is much more effective to receive such feedback during trainings, to try out new managerial ideas in an educational format, than at once on living people and a working business. <br><br>  Negotiation techniques in a duel, you can use any, no restrictions.  That is why I believe that the ‚Äúmanagement duel‚Äù is not a negotiation technology, but a feedback technology ‚Äî about the quality of management decisions and negotiation skills.  Negotiations are only a form that allows you to create a resistance environment for solutions ("the brick does not give change").  It is one thing to develop and present a theory about what would be fair if employees reduce wages and the company's profit becomes greater.  And it is quite another to tell the player playing the role of the employee that it is he who will be reduced wages.  It will be much more difficult to convince him that this is fair, lawful and expedient. <br><br>  The more skillful the decision, the more likely the player will be able to achieve a result in life;  faster and less costly for their own and those around them. <br>  And the point is not in the magic methods of struggle.  They exist, but many tricks refer to form, not substance.  The more experienced the players, the smaller the role played by the appearance, the image, and the more the rivals try to understand what is behind the words.  Simple techniques and especially manipulations just stop working.  Stay strategy and quality decisions.  An experienced negotiator automatically rejects options that are unacceptable to the other side, asymmetrical in profit.  Because no strong opponent will agree with the option that infringes upon him.  As a result, negotiations take place several times faster. <br><br>  Of course, in practice, the <a href="http://www.poedinki.ru/skill/technology/">technology is richer, more details</a> .  There are seconds and referee.  You can play several rounds, passing the course with the help of a chess clock and changing roles.  You can take a pause and make protests.  There are several formats of fights - classic, described above, express, doubles and command. <br><br><h4>  Art and technology </h4><br>  A good friend of mine, a professional in managerial fights, somehow looked into the grocery department of the Moscow department store.  I must say that the first floor of the department store is a vanity fair, there are expensive wines, and a jewelry department, and what not.  Therefore, when Mikhail stretched out a five-thousand-dollar bill, he was full of confidence that the cashier would have to surrender, and if not, it was easy to exchange a bill.  In response to his smile, the cashier barked loudly: <br>  - Where will I find you the change? <br>  Mikhail, feeling that he was right, was smiling, silently looking at the cashier.  She continued, rather abruptly: <br>  - Do not you see that there is no change? <br>  The pause continued.  The cashier opened the drawer and blurted out with reproach: <br>  - You see that there is nothing to give change? <br>  Michael was silent.  And smiled.  The queue already understood that something unusual was happening and began to observe what was happening with interest.  The tone of the cashier has become a little softer: <br>  - For the whole day you run into ... <br>  Michael was silent.  The line also stopped, everything happened in complete silence.  The cashier has already started conciliatory: <br>  - You understand that I am not from a good life like that. <br>  A long pause continued.  Michael looked at the cashier with a smile.  She lifted the plastic sheet in the advanced cash register and there were thousands of bills there.  She counted out the change and politely said: <br>  - Excuse me, please. <br>  - Come on!  - for the first time said something Michael. <br><br>  Were wrestling techniques used here?  Of course.  "Energy Break".  The background is the social pressure of the queue at the cashier (and Michael too), a sense of inner rightness in the look and behavior.  But is it possible to describe all the situations when and how to apply this technique?  Experience shows that the context is very influential.  And the same technique performed by another person, in another situation, may not work.  Therefore, the management struggle is not only technology, but also art, creativity, with all its joys and sorrows. <br><br>  But technology is not only about tricks.  It gives structure, introduces terminology, and describes how people interact, what they fight for.  And having already learned to distinguish the business struggle from the positional, ethics of the world from the ethics of war, to see the roles, without any tricks you can noticeably improve your managerial results. <br><br>  But those who focus on the understanding of other people become true asas.  Even Henry Ford said: "If there is a secret of success, then it is the ability to understand the point of view of another person and see through his eyes."  It is no accident that the term ‚Äúpicture of the world‚Äù is one of the central in the management struggle.  Without understanding the picture of the world of another person, it is pointless to improve the technique of negotiations. <br><br><h4>  Situations </h4><br>  Situations are different.  From business - interaction between companies.  From the corporate environment - all the action takes place within the company.  Household - with friends, officials, sellers.  Family ... <br><br>  I will give a few examples. <br><br><ol><li> In the company selling medical goods and equipment, in the sales department a high percentage of sales.  The department is successful, the company's sales have grown strongly in 5 years, but the market has also grown.  As a result, wages have become much higher than the market average.  The director wants to reduce them to the market.  The sales manager is ready to quit in this case.  Head of sales against - wants to keep the team. </li><li>  The owner of a country house, while he is selling it, occupies the Tenant for a symbolic rent.  Finally, the Owner manages to find a Buyer who is satisfied with the price and likes the house.  After checking the documents, the buyer sends an advance.  The term of the conclusion of the contract is suitable, however, the Buyer asks to significantly reduce the price: he spoke with the Tenant, who did not respond in the best way about the living conditions in this house and pointed out that there are many cheaper offers in the district. </li><li>  The sales agent received money from the client, but did not inform the company.  Together with the order of dismissal, a second order was prepared: to recover the stolen amount from all employees of the company in proportion to the amount of wages.  From all, including the director.  The head of the sales department is protesting and demanding the return of his money, since he does not consider himself guilty.  Moreover, he believes that it is not necessary to dismiss the agent, but to make him work out the stolen goods.  Agent does not enter into any negotiations.  He stayed with the last conversation on the subject of the paperwork on dismissal. </li></ol><br><br>  Express fights (they are also called ‚Äúquick managerial struggle‚Äù) are simpler in plot, they usually have two roles, but they require an immediate reaction, here and now.  A few examples. <br><br><ol><li>  Between the two experienced and valuable employees for the company there was a serious conflict in front of the head of the department.  After that, one of the employees approached the head of the department and said: ‚ÄúChoose: either I or he, I will not work with him anymore!‚Äù </li><li>  Cafe visitor is a frequent customer places for a long time.  Always received a good quality of service and, accordingly, left a good tip.  Once again, visiting the institution, which turned out to be much more full than usual, the visitor was faced with the fact that people who came after him had already received an order, but for the time being they did not even get the menu.  Pointing to the waiter, the visitor receives the answer: ‚ÄúWait a little more, you are our favorite customer!‚Äù </li><li>  Ten o'clock.  The company is preparing for tomorrow's prestigious presentation.  The director has the intention to work late with everyone in order to morally inspire the team - moving tables, chairs, completing materials.  A wife appears with the firm intention of taking the director home.  She speaks to her husband at subordinates with the words: ‚ÄúYou are tired, look, sweaty all.  Now get dressed, there is someone to work with! ‚Äù </li></ol><br><br><h4>  Technology author </h4><br>  <a href="http://tarasov.ru/about/tarasov">Vladimir Konstantinovich Tarasov</a> - founder of the Tallinn School of Managers, the first business school in the USSR (since 1984).  This is an amazing person who gives me the deepest respect - both made and their views on life, their values.  I consider him to be my teacher.  Tarasova is sometimes mistakenly called only a business coach.  He calls himself a social technologist.  Indeed, as you read his books and attend seminars, an ever deeper understanding of ‚Äúhow it works‚Äù arises - why people behave this way and not otherwise;  how to learn to manage well. <br>  But the most valuable for me in his views was the philosophy of management.  Amazing.  After all, Tarasov has many practical answers and techniques, but it is philosophy that makes it possible to combine all these parts into a logical and clear whole.  Its integral part is ethics, which is the rarest case!  - can be combined with the effectiveness of the methods. <br><br>  If you have a desire to get acquainted with the thoughts of Tarasov, I would recommend starting with the book "Russian lessons of Japanese koans."  There are 15 short koans in it, in which - like in the photo - a small episode of life is seen.  The author begins to examine each of them and gradually it becomes clear how a deep understanding of what is happening is born from insignificant details.  Drawing parallels with some other situations, Vladimir Konstantinovich imperceptibly gives lessons.  But the main thing that you understand after reading this book is how little we see in managerial and life situations, and there is a desire to learn it.  Even if it takes years. <br>  Then you can get acquainted with the philosophical "Technology of life: a book for heroes" and practical "The art of managerial struggle."  Listen to live or audio recording seminars "Personal Management Art" and "Eight Steps of Management Art".  Join the <a href="http://www.russianmanagement.com/">online school of Vladimir Tarasov</a> .  After that, my recommendations will no longer be needed, you will determine what else you need to read and find out. <br><br><h4>  Sport </h4><br>  In addition to the training and evaluation of technology (which can be used by recruiters to select personnel), there is one more.  This is the competitive side. <br>  Since 2001, there is the <a href="http://www.poedinki.ru/">Federation of Managerial Struggle</a> , which holds competitions, determines the qualifications of judges, players and arbitrators. <br><br>  The spirit of managerial fights as a sport can be compared with the Brain Ring tournaments.  To be in ‚Äúmanagerial form,‚Äù many managers and executives regularly train.  There are clubs and management communities in many cities of Russia, in Ukraine, Belarus, and Moldova.  Open city cups, quick managerial tournaments, informal Champion Cups - where only those who win in open tournaments and the crown of games - the Russian Championship - all that is necessary for intellectual sports are available. <br><br><h4>  What do fights give </h4><br>  What do regular workouts give? <br><br>  <i>Management skills and negotiation.</i>  The ability to deeply see the situation and make informed decisions, the skills to persuade and hear the other, to stand under pressure and not to succumb to emotions. <br><br>  <i>Timely feedback.</i>  Life changes, your tasks and environment - and the types of conflicts change with them;  you yourself grow and develop, which means that new errors are replacing the old ones.  Why this time the owners found your decision unsuccessful?  Why to you no one wanted to get a job?  How did it happen that you took control?  Each match gives a detailed answer to these questions here and now. <br><br>  <i>Saving relationships.</i>  At the level of sensations, you begin to understand why it is necessary to give way to life and save face to opponents, even when they are wrong.  Why it is necessary to evaluate the actions, not the person.  You begin to feel how respect for your opponent helps to build a productive conversation and achieve results. <br><br>  <i>Save time on negotiations.</i>  All experienced players say this.  Hours are compressed in tens of minutes, what used to take tens of minutes - is solved in a matter of minutes.  A clear goal, a vision of the interests not only of one‚Äôs own, but also of one‚Äôs partner, the absence of an extra struggle ‚Äî all this helps to squeeze time.  The number of unsent and unwritten letters has dramatically increased - I began to understand much earlier that the desired goal could not be achieved by letter. <br><br>  <i>Saving forces and emotions.</i>  If the question can be solved calmly, why fight?  Masters avoid unnecessary struggle. <br><br>  <i>Expanding horizons.</i>  You begin to understand what the interests of the financial director, and what the sales manager.  Learn the difference between different types of business, different partnership formats. <br><br>  A nice bonus - managerial fights <i>introduce people</i> who want to develop, strive for more, with their eyes burning.  This is just great. <br><br><h4>  Occasion </h4><br>  I said that there is a reason for writing an article.  Reveal the secret.  Until April 14, Yandex accepts applications for participation in the First Student Management Championship in Moscow.  We invite senior students and graduate students who want to realize themselves in the field of management and are ready to test their leadership skills in practice. <br><br>  The competition will be held in two stages: <br><ul><li>  April 20 - qualifying tests (for participation you must <a href="http://bit.ly/regchamp">submit an application</a> ). </li><li>  April 27 - the main tests, which will be attended by 16 winners of the qualifying round.  Experienced negotiators and businessmen will evaluate their skills. </li></ul><br><br>  Participants in the second stage will be invited to a free tour of the Yandex data center, the winners will receive 1 terabyte on Yandex.Disk as a gift for an unlimited period and the opportunity to enter the <a href="http://tech.yandex.ru/education/managers-school/2014/">Yandex Managers School</a> without exams, and a special prize will be prepared for the absolute winner.  And of course, everyone without exception is waiting for interesting communication and vivid impressions! <br><br>  <a href="http://bit.ly/champabout">Learn more about the event</a> . <br><br><h4>  You want peace, get ready to fight! </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219013/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219013/</a></p>
