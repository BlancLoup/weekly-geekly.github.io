Many of our customers have become worried that they will be forced to pay for the LTS version of Java when performing their workload.  As a first step, we recently <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/re-affirming-long-term-support-for-java-in-amazon-linux/">confirmed long-term Java support on Amazon Linux</a> .  However, our customers and the wider Java community are launching Java on various platforms, both on AWS and beyond.  That is why we are pleased to announce a preliminary <i>[preview]</i> version of <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/corretto">Amazon Corretto</a> - a free, multiplatform and ready-to-use distribution for the OpenJDK distribution from Amazon. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAmazon has a long and deep history with Java.  I am very happy to see that the work of our internal critical Java team is becoming available to the rest of the world. ‚Äù <br>  - James Gosling <i>[James Gosling, creator of the Java language, has been working at AWS since May 2017]</i> </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Amazon launches Corretto in production for thousands of services.  Corretto's patches and enhancements allow Amazon to solve large-scale, real-world problems by meeting high performance and scalability requirements.  We make them available to customers with free and long-term support, with quarterly updates, including bug fixes and security updates.  AWS also provides customers with urgent fixes outside the quarterly schedule. <br><br>  Corretto comes with support for multiple platforms, allowing you to run it in the cloud, on its servers or on a local machine.  Corretto 8 preview corresponds to OpenJDK 8 and is currently available for Amazon Linux 2, Microsoft Windows, macOS platforms and as a Docker image.  Pre-builds can be downloaded from <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/corretto">aws.amazon.com/corretto</a> .  The publicly available version of <i>[General Availability] is</i> scheduled for the first quarter of 2019, and will also include support for the Ubuntu and Red Hat Enterprise Linux platforms.  Corretto 11, corresponding to OpenJDK 11, on these platforms will be released with sufficient time to test until April 2019.

      We run the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_Compatibility_Kit">Technology Compatibility Kit</a> (TCK) <i>[test suite for testing JVM implementation for specification]</i> on every Corretto release to ensure compatibility with the Java SE platform.  Corretto is designed as a replacement for any of the Java SE distributions, if you are not using features that are missing from OpenJDK (for example, Java Flight Recorder <i>[in fact, JFR was added by Oracle in OpenJDK 11]</i> ).  After the Corretto build is installed on the host and properly configured to run your Java applications (for example, using alternatives on Linux), the existing command line parameters, settings, monitoring, and everything else will continue to work as before. <br><br>  Amazon will distribute security updates to Corretto 8 for free at least until June 2023, and for Corretto 11 until August 2024.  Corretto includes backports from newer versions, as well as fresh improvements from the OpenJDK community.  The release process includes testing on thousands of Amazon services, which allows you to release patches within a few days of finding problems. <br><br><h2>  Beginning of work </h2><br>  The easiest way to try Corretto is to download the package for the selected platform and check the Java version: <br><br><pre><code class="plaintext hljs">% java -version openjdk version "1.8.0_192" OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_192-amazon-corretto-preview-b12) OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.192-b12, mixed mode)</code> </pre> <br>  <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/corretto/latest/corretto-8-ug/downloads-list.html">The download page</a> has a list of links to installation instructions for all supported platforms. <br><br><h2>  Corretto and OpenJDK </h2><br>  Amazon has already made a small contribution to OpenJDK 8 and we look forward to working closely with the OpenJDK community on future enhancements to OpenJDK 8 and 11. We transfer the fixes made to OpenJDK, add improvements based on our own experience and needs, and then build the Corretto builds .  If the promotion of these patches is not successful, is postponed, or is not suitable for the OpenJDK project, we will provide them to our customers as long as the patches have value for them.  If the problem is solved in OpenJDK in a different way, we will proceed to this solution as soon as this transition is safe.  You can find the Corretto source code at <a href="https://github.com/corretto">github.com/corretto</a> . <br><br>  We plan that Corretto will become the default OpenJDK distribution on Amazon Linux 2 in 2019. <br><br>  We encourage you to run your Java applications using Corretto.  Download Corretto 8 by visiting <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/corretto">aws.amazon.com/corretto</a> , and learn more about it by reading the documentation at <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto">docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto</a> .
