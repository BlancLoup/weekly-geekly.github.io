How many times, having opened ‚Äúfor a minute‚Äù Youtube, Facebook or Twitter, did you catch yourself doing the same thing an hour later? <br><br>  Cognitive psychology defines habit as an automatic behavior that arises in a particular situation. <br>  Products and services that we use out of habit, change our behavior according to the intentions of their designers.  What makes some products such "habit-forming"? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Model Description </h4><br>  The author's research led to the creation of the Hook model: a 4-phase process that companies use to shape user habits.

Paid</u> <br>  Advertising, setting the place in the search results and other paid channels are usually used to attract the user's attention and make him take action.  Usually used only in the initial stages of working with the user. <br><br>  <u>2. Honored</u> <br>  Positive mentions in the media, viral videos on Youtube, allocated places in the app stores (for example, the Editor‚Äôs Choice block in the AppStore) are places for which money is usually not paid (or not paid directly), but which make it possible to attract the user's attention. <br><br>  <u>3. "Word of mouth"</u> <br>  When users of a product tell their friends about it through personal communication, sending a link to Facebook or via email, this can be a very effective external trigger for action. <br><br>  <u>4. Real</u> <br>  Triggers that the user himself places in his environment.  Application icon, email subscription to which the user is subscribed, notification about the application update occurs only if the user agrees to receive them. <br><br>  However, external triggers are just the first step.  Their main goal is to involve the user in the ‚ÄúHook Model‚Äù, so that with time he will no longer need external triggers and at the same time internal triggers will be formed. <br><br><h4>  Internal Triggers </h4><br>  These include emotions, especially negative ones.  Feelings of boredom, loneliness, disappointment, indecision cause a slight pain or irritation and cause an almost instantaneous and often unconscious action to relieve a negative feeling.  For example, opening Youtube from boredom or Twitter from loneliness. <br><br>  Positive emotions can also serve as internal triggers.  For example, the desire to share good news leads the user to Facebook. <br><br>  In the case of internal triggers, information about what to do next is contained in the user's memory. <br><br>  An association between a specific product and an internal trigger can be formed by weeks and months of regular use. <br><br>  The most important goal of habit-forming products is to solve a user's problem in such a way that he has a clear association between the product and the solution. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Triggers at the example of Instagram</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  An essential component of Instagram's success is the ability of service creators to understand what drives them by users. <br>  For many, Instagram is a repository for emotions, inspiration, their memoirs in digital form. <br>  Acquaintance with the service begins with an external trigger as a recommendation from a friend. <br>  Each time a user adds a photo, he can share it with friends on Facebook or Twitter. <br>  This action is an external Relationship trigger, attracting attention and serving so that other users install the application. <br>  After the application is installed, Real Triggers come into play in the form of an application icon and push notifications about new ‚Äúlikes‚Äù, comments and subscribers. <br>  Over time, the user forms a link between the fear of losing a special moment in life and the internal trigger in the form of Instagram, which removes this pain by adding a picture to your tape. <br>  Instagram is not just a service for photos, it is a social network that helps get rid of boredom by connecting with other people through the publication of photos and clicking on a heart like. <br></div></div><br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247687/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247687/</a></p>
