      For the readers of ‚ÄúMegamind‚Äù, Mr. Khachatryan formulated 8 short tips. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Council number 1</b> .  Today, mono-business is a bit dangerous, because it has too heavy and wide risk structure.  The investment portfolio should have several directions, like a living organism - the legs, otherwise any shaking can knock the business down.  And the two will rise harder. <br><br>  <b>Council number 2</b> .  Provide at least a partial guarantee of sales before you create a product that you are going to sell.  Before investing your time (and this is the most valuable) in a business, try to create the right atmosphere for the further realization of your product.  In other words - try to find the right partners whose audiences can be interesting and useful for your product, offer your partners the best conditions and thus ensure a good pilot launch of your product without serious expenses for classical marketing. <br><br>  <b>Council number 3</b> .  Learn and use competitors' products more often than yours.  Feel free to borrow ideas from other companies, but try to fully immerse yourself in the idea and invest your spirit and logic in its implementation, the usual copy / paste never works. <br><br>  <b>Council number 4</b> .  Never forget about quality support for your product.  Often, the lively and professional communication of your customer support with the obligatory presence of a sense of humor is the key to your customer's loyalty to your service, regardless of the number of bugs and other difficulties. <br><br>  <b>Council number 5</b> .  Focus on the essentials, identify the real goals for the product, not just your personal desires.  You, as the ‚Äúparent‚Äù of your product, constantly want to add something new to it, which the team calls ‚Äúfeatureism‚Äù - like a disease.  You can't blame for this, but try to determine the correct proportion of innovations.  Keep the right balance. <br><br>  <b>Council number 6</b> .  Forget about rest, as a separable concept from work.  If you are resting from work and you need it, then you are not doing your own business.  Your business is what you should think about at the best moments of your vacation.  It is then that the best ideas come that do not come into routine everyday life. <br><br>  <b>Council number 7</b> .  Split the days of the week on different subjects.  It is clear that it is more convenient for you to concentrate on the part of the business that you like or get more, but you need to remember that every aspect of the business is important and needs attention.  Give each day of the week your theme and immerse yourself in it to improve and optimize processes. <br><br>  <b>Council number 8</b> .  Try to draw conclusions from your own mistakes and fakapov.  Try to hold the rod.  Sooner or later, you need to get up on some of the parties and make decisions.  Over time, you need to create and comply with the set of qualities that is most comfortable for you and those around you - and stick to it, both in work and in life. <br><blockquote>  <i>Editorial note: if you have a desire to participate in the ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Tips‚Äù section, write to us at editor (at) megamozg.ru</i> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296734/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296734/</a></p>
