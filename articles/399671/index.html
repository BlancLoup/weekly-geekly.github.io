Older nuclear power plants around the world now need to be gradually decommissioned and closed, while spent fuel and equipment should be cut, poured with concrete and buried away from people. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Reprocessing and disposal of spent nuclear fuel and other waste is a complex engineering task.  First of all, because all operations at nuclear power plants are performed by robots, and not by humans, for safety purposes.  The fuel itself and reactor fragments should be cut into small fragments and placed in containers for disposal.  For example, at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, these canisters are only 4444 mm long and 1876.4 mm in diameter.  At ChNPP, a stationary circular saw is used, which can cut only rods that are previously placed in the machine. <br><br>  Work on the delivery and cutting of spent fuel at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant are carried out automatically, with remote control.  The American company Holtec has <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/282728/">built a robotized mini-plant</a> for this, where the spent fuel is prepared for disposal.

A simple laser cutter is enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fc/5c6/e3c/8fc5c6e3c5714a79be278d568c10054a.jpg"><br>  <i>Cutter with circular saw for cutting rods.</i>  <i>The photo was taken during acceptance of the HOYAT-2 plant in operation.</i> <br><br>  The ChNPP example well demonstrates the challenges that engineers face when developing automated equipment for cutting nuclear waste.  Fortunately, science does not stand still, and robotics companies are ready to offer more advanced and versatile equipment for the disposal of nuclear waste.  Given the need to decommission old unsafe nuclear reactors, such equipment will come in handy. <br><br>  The British company <a href="http://www.ocrobotics.com/">OC Robotics has</a> developed an unusual machine that looks like a thick metal snake with a death sting.  This is a robotic <a href="http://www.ocrobotics.com/lasersnake2/">LaserSnake2</a> manipulator, which is precisely positioned in all degrees of freedom and equipped with a powerful laser cutter for cutting any material. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hqOfRhJsaEQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The project has <a href="http://www.ocrobotics.com/lasersnake2--news--lasersnake2-press-release/">been under development since 2013</a> .  He was led by OC Robotics with the participation of TWI, the National Nuclear Laboratory, ULO Optics and Laser Optical Engineering.  Funding was provided by Innovate UK, the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change, and the UK nuclear facility decommissioning department. <br><br>  After a three-year development of the ‚Äúlaser snake‚Äù in July-August 2016, the machine was installed and tested at the First Generation Reprocessing Plant nuclear waste processing plant in Sellafield (United Kingdom).  This is an extensive nuclear complex on the coast of the Irish Sea.  Over the years, weapons-grade plutonium was produced here (since 1950), fuel was produced for nuclear power plants, irradiated nuclear fuel was reprocessed, and nuclear power plants operated (from 1956 to 1983). <br><br>  Operation LaserSnake2 showed that the machine successfully copes with the tasks.  In November 2016, this robot was even <a href="http://www.ocrobotics.com/lasersnake2--news--a-world-first--laser-cutting-for-nuclear-decommissioning-at-sellafield/">awarded the</a> Technology / Innovation Implementation Award from the UK Decommissioning Authority. <br><br>  The technology of the new generation can be widely used in real conditions of disposal and recycling of nuclear waste.  Including stations that are decommissioned. <br><br>  The cutter is designed on the basis of a high-power laser with an optical focusing system (see <a href="http://www.ocrobotics.com/downloads/Website/LS2/Use%2520of%2520a%2520diffrractive%2520optic%2520for%2520high%2520power%2520laser%2520cutting.pdf">beam parameters and cutting speed</a> when testing a 5-kilowatt laser and various diffractive lenses). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58f/c98/367/58fc98367e9249cbbc30dc62a0430d2b.png"><br><br>  Cutter LaserSnake2 copes even with thick metal parts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/540/781/cba/540781cbab31a8961c947e1e3a814a4a.jpg"><br><br>  Remote control cutter provides a group of engineers, which is located in a safe room. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a01/bc1/bb8/a01bc1bb8e248b477a5b5c3948c9d270.jpg"><br><br>  Developers believe that LaserSnake2 can be useful not only for waste disposal, but also to perform laser cutting tasks in any hostile to humans or limited conditions, including <a href="http://www.ocrobotics.com/downloads/Website/LS2/Underwater%2520cutting%2520as%2520a%2520decommissioning%2520tool.pdf">under water</a> .  In the future, nothing prevents to combine this robot with a mobile platform, providing it with a certain freedom of movement. <br><br>  In addition to nuclear power, LaserSnake2 is proposed to be used in the oil and gas sector, where such a facility can take part in the inspection and repair of pipes and equipment, in construction and engineering works.  For example, in cramped conditions for designing an airliner, during assembly and maintenance of aircraft wings. <br><br>  Together with the robot comes with software for management.  Developers can tailor the design of the LaserSnake2 to perform specific tasks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399671/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399671/</a></p>
