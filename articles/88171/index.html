      And those who have not read the previous topic about the film base, will find even more interesting things for themselves. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To start a retrospective.  <a href="http://kinobaza.tv/">We</a> are the best service among all the others with similar functionality, because: <br><ol><li>  There are no services with the same functionality: The filmbase is a truly unique (in RuNet) service. </li><li>  This is the most convenient place to choose a movie available on the network, and after that - to select the best release available. <br><ul><li>  It is more convenient here than on a torrent tracker, since  You see movies not from one tracker, but from all at once.  You can choose the most appropriate release or release with the most number of seeders in just a few seconds. </li><li>  It is more convenient here than on sites like movie searching and imdb, because you only see movies that you can download right now. </li><li>  It is more convenient here than anywhere else, because you can filter movies by any parameter set (release year, ratings, release quality, actors and directors, ...), immediately and visually see the available release quality and tracker list, from where the film can be downloaded . </li></ul><br></li><li>  If the movie you like is not yet available, or there is no suitable quality release, you can subscribe to a notification about the release of the movie in the required quality and / or the desired tracker.  Notifications are sent to e-mail, to RSS, via XMPP (Jabber). </li></ol><br>  Read more - in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_advertising/79739/">past topic about the film base</a> . <br><br>  But we do not stand still.  Since the opening of the site, many interesting features have appeared, the most important of which is subscription to TV shows. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="series selection" alt=" " src="http://strangecompany.ru/habr/screenshot61.png"></div><br><br><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img title="subscription to the series" alt="  " src="http://strangecompany.ru/habr/screenshot62.png"></div><br><br><br>  It would seem that those who need to receive notification of the release of new series, have already found a good way to do it.  But the filmbase allows: <br><ul><li>  Subscribe to any of the TV shows available in runet.  This is not a choice of the 20 most popular, not a subscription only to those who like the creators of the site.  Our search engine is looking for the seasons and the series of all the TV shows that are in runet - that's about 4,000 pieces (maybe we missed some animes :) </li><li>  Receive notification by e-mail, via XMPP or RSS in less than 10 minutes after the appearance of a new series on one of the trackers. </li></ul><br><br>  If you use such a wonderful service as myshows.ru - you can <a href="http://kinobaza.tv/my/my-shows-ru">import</a> a list of TV shows that you watch / watch to the film database, and you will not have to re-subscribe to each of them.  Available only after registration, as well as some other interesting features. <br><br>  Since the launch of the site, we have been involved in not only the subscription mechanism for serials, although heuristic linking of torrents with serials, seasons and episodes is a rather trivial task.  Some more useful things have become available: <br><ul><li>  You can mark already viewed movies or movies that you do not want to watch - they will not be shown when filtering (if the corresponding setting is enabled) </li><li>  You can mark the films that you plan to watch - their list will be available on a separate page. </li><li>  a few more torrent trackers have been added (although many have yet to be added. While we were trying to develop qualitatively, not quantitatively) </li><li>  slightly increased the amount of information about the film (and how much remains to be added - ooh ...) </li><li>  added the ability to leave (and read) movie reviews, as well as evaluate them </li><li>  you can save the filters and return to them when again there will be nothing to see </li><li>  many small and not very interface improvements </li></ul><br><br>  I want to note that many of the changes on the site were suggested by our users through the feedback form or by e-mail (there is in the footer of the site).  Write to us - we implement interesting and popular ideas.  And if you don‚Äôt write, we don‚Äôt know that the idea is in demand. <br><br>  In the near future we have the connection of the film ratings, personal forecasts and recommendations on the imhonet engine, the addition of various information about the films (and series) and something else.
