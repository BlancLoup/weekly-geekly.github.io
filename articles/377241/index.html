  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Chinese ID cards. From shabby papers to the card "all in one"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The history of identification documents in China has always been particularly acute.  A huge population has always forced the government to treat this problem with the utmost care.  Due to the fact that for four years, as an active replacement of ID-cards with third-generation cards, which include a bank card, transport card, health insurance policy, fingerprint information, etc., I would like to highlight what these documents represent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f6/ad0/63f/8f6ad063f80f42c7b258ea0ab29ab4a7.jpg"><br>  <i>The official photo of the third generation ID-card as it tells us the main functions - a bank card, fingerprint repository, identity card</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the official name is the Identity Card of a Citizen of the People‚Äôs Republic of China (‰∏≠Âçé Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩ). <br><br>  The situation with identity cards in the PRC, with all the efforts of the authorities, remained catastrophic.  A huge number of different types of IDs made this situation even more difficult - identity cards of the Chinese Republic (1911-1949), certificates of loyal citizens issued by the Japanese government during the occupation, various certificates of different provinces (primarily separatist-minded western provinces, especially Xinjiang, Tibet, Ningxia, etc.).  All this made the normal identification of a citizen in principle impossible.  What kind of identification, standardization of document circulation and paperwork, taxation can be discussed if more than 20 types of ID cards are valid at the same time in the country?

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea8/097/87c/ea809787cf3649e1a52d59c67373c2b4.jpg"><br>  <i>ID of the Republic of China (1911-1949).</i>  <i>By his number, one can judge how ‚Äúdistributed‚Äù the identity cards were at that time.</i>  <i>Document ‚Ññ5757 with a population of several hundred millions ...</i> <br><br>  Again, the solution to the problem appeared on the horizon only during Deng Xiaoping‚Äôs presidency - a truly legendary person who didn‚Äôt let the country fall into the abyss where Hu Yaobang and others like her confidently led her and pulled her out of the cesspool.  The very fact that Mao for all the decades of the government has failed even to introduce a single identification card speaks for itself.  And until 1984, as citizens of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, they used everything they could get, including registration documents at a certain address. <br><br>  About the influence of this dwarf (Dan Syaopin's height is 157 cm) for the rest of his life in China is also said by the fact that when he retired and remained only the chairman of the All-China Bridge Federation, the entire Chinese elite, according to the writer, ‚Äúcaught everybody and every finger movement. "  Well, okay, the topic is not about that. <br><br>  One way or another, on April 6, 1984, the State Council of the People's Republic of China sent a notification to the Ministry of Public Security and at the same time published the ‚ÄúStandards and Rules on Identity Cards in the People's Republic of China‚Äù.  On July 1, 1995, new identity cards entered the exploitation phase.  Already by the time it took for the endemic photographing of all citizens of the country, changing the regulations, the preparation of technical support, one can judge how much colossal work was done.  All citizens of the country were ‚Äúdocumented‚Äù, and on January 1, 2004, with the acceptance of the second generation ID cards, they began to be retired. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/120/a01/1ac/120a011ac46f4e04ba3512f6ee63c66d.jpg"><br>  <i>So he looked.</i>  <i>Name, nationality, date of birth, place of issue, registration, expiration date and number.</i> <br><br>  Their value, again, is difficult to overestimate.  For the first time in the history of the People's Republic of China, it became possible to create a common database of the country's population, standardize the workflow, conduct a normal census of the population, and so on.  Although they are decommissioned, they are valid, and in any place - from the cashier at the station to the tax, you can choose the 1st or 2nd generation of identification cards. <br><br>  I would like to dwell a little bit more on the second generation, as now it is the main valid document in the PRC.  The first generation is almost completely out of service, and the third is just beginning to be put into operation. <br><br>  So, he was put into operation (in the future I will call him masculine, since shenfenzhen (Ôºâ is translated into Russian as masculine) on January 1, 2001. At first glance, it contains the same information as the previous generation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a65/b69/3ac/a65b693ac7094a239cb3fe2ae50326ee.jpg"><br>  <i>ÂßìÂêç „ÄÅ ÊÄßÂà´ „ÄÅ Ê∞ëÊóè „ÄÅ Âá∫Áîü Êó•Êúü „ÄÅ „ÄÅ ‰ΩèÂú∞ „ÄÅ ÂÖ¨Ê∞ë ÂÖ¨Ê∞ë Ë∫´‰ªΩËØÅ  - nothing extra</i> <br><br>  The main difference from the previous generation is the integrated <a href="http://baike.baidu.com/view/4189.htm">IC card</a> (Integrated Circuit Card).  It contains all the same information as that provided by the text, but in electronic form, which can be read by special devices.  This is a huge step forward - when you make a ticket at the station, the cashier does not need to dial all these numbers and names - just put the card on the reader.  Get a printout of your tax return at the tax inspectorate at the self-service terminal, simply by attaching it to the reader.  In general, in all cases where data is required of a citizen - it is enough for an organization to acquire the necessary device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7e/29e/c9e/b7e29ec9e9f3484fb920dbfc0a62e69a.png"><br>  <i>You can purchase it on any website if you have permission to use it from the Ministry of Public Security.</i> <br><br>  In practice, this means that where minutes were spent, now it takes a couple of seconds.  Given China‚Äôs population, it‚Äôs saving millions of man-hours and myriad nerve cells. <br><br>  Yes, damn it, when I pick up a child from kindergarten, I just need to attach it to the reader at the entrance - and it will show me who his parents are. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fbd/394/90c/fbd39490cc5b4a8ea070f2e63a941be7.jpg"><br>  <i>Multifunctional terminal at the entrance to the kindergarten.</i> <br><br>  Naturally, I can not tell you anything about the technical details.  What data transfer technology is used, how many memory cells are in the card, data encryption, etc.  In China, many people turn a blind eye, although it is prohibited by law (the same prostitution, the same gambling, etc.), but there are three types of crimes that it is better not to commit here.  Identity fraud is one of them. <br><br>  Well, okay, I was again distracted.  The third generation of ID-cards contains: <br><br>  1) text information about the name, nationality, date of birth, registration <br>  2) photo <br>  3) fingerprints <br>  4) is a bank payment card <br>  5) any other information on the requirements of the citizen. <br><br>  That is the most impressive is the fact that anything can be added to it.  Discount card for your fitness center?  Yes please.  A medical record with all your illnesses ‚Äî yes no problem (ZY) This is a miracle of miracles when the doctor simply puts your shenfengzheng on his reader and the history of your sciatica is recorded there. Come to another hospital - the doctor reads what happened to you. Map bus / metro ride - for God's sake. Purchase certificate, travel card, ticket - yes, anything, Apple has OFFER to integrate everything into the phone and not stand next to the Chinese government, which can ORDER to provide the SDK with a specific network and integrate  . Amb it in shenfenchzhen half billion potential users, and your service is integrated in their passport \ bank card -. About this many dream of those intrigues, which are now wrapped around these agreements, it is possible to write a whole bunch of exciting detective. <br><br>  In fact, the third generation of cards, even though it has been put into official use, is not in the hands of anyone yet.  Now there is a process of gradual integration of the main addition - fingerprints into various devices, alpha testing, etc.  The main requirement for certification by the Ministry of Public Security is two-factor user identification - the IC chip in the card itself, which must be attached to the reader and the fingerprint reading as the second stage of authorization.  In the future, it will be possible to pay for a pack of cigarettes in a stall under the house by putting your finger to the terminal in a stall.  And that's cool. <br><br>  PS <br>  1) The laid out images of ID-cards are completely legal by ‰∏≠Âçé‰∫∫Ê∞ëÂÖ±ÂíåÂõΩ Â±ÖÊ∞ë Ë∫´‰ªΩËØÅ Ê≥ï - public information is the number of shenfenzhenzha, gender of the owner, date of birth and place of issuance, available on <a href="http://www.nciic.com.cn/">ÂÖ®ÂõΩ ÂÖ¨Ê∞ë Ë∫´‰ªΩËØÅ Âè∑Á†Å Êü•ËØ¢ ÊúçÂä° ‰∏≠ÂøÉ</a> - National database of identification card numbers .  The first-generation Shenfengzheni (and their images as well) are invalid since January 1, 2004. <br>  2) Scolding Mao Zedong is normal.  Conduct fraud with ID-cards (and their images) - up to the death penalty. <br>  3) Lovers of foil hats are definitely not the place in China.  When I had problems with counterintelligence (purely because of my irrepressible curiosity, do not ask about anything), I looked into my own business, which is accessible in two mouse clicks to any policeman - everything was there from the moment of crossing the border.  From hotels where I stayed when I went somewhere and bus tickets to the history of phone calls with a ‚ÄúPlay‚Äú button for each <br>  4) In addition to paragraph 2.  I sincerely admire China, I sincerely admire how from the dung pit of 1949 they were able to reach today's heights and I really want to live in this country and contribute to its prosperity.  I admire the fact that the illiteracy rate dropped from 96% in 1949 to 6% in 2014. I admire the fact that where the locomotive once (in 2004) went, the CRH now flies at a speed of 300 km / h.  I admire the fact that since 2000, power plants with an aggregate capacity of about 150 GW have been commissioned.  I admire the construction of thousands of kilometers of high-speed roads in places where there used to be primers.  I admire the fact that this is the third country that has its own orbital station.  And so on, and so on and so on and on forever‚Ä¶ <br>  According to statistics, out of 100 visitors to China, 90 do not like him, 9 is neutral or positive.  I treat those who imbued her completely and fell ill for life. <br>  5) Thank you Âëú for the fact that, before handing over his 1st generation Shenfengzhen, he was not too lazy to take his photo. <br>  Thanks for attention.  I hope it was interesting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377241/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377241/</a></p>
