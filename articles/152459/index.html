Training will be held twice a week, from December 2012 to May 2013.  Our school will be taught by <a href="http://school.hh.ru/teachers">leading programmers of the</a> company and invited experts, for example, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/zibsun/" class="user_link">Zibsun</a> . In addition, our students are paid a stipend and upon graduation, all students will receive certificates of attendance.  The best students are guaranteed employment in the company HeadHunter. But we will not forget about the rest either: they will be given recommendations to large IT companies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Why do we need a school of programmers </h4><br>  We have a saying that in fact HeadHunter is an Internet company that develops a site for convenient and comfortable search for vacancies and employees.  The site itself is a complex system and consists of a large number of autonomous services.  The main languages ‚Äã‚Äãused are Java and Python, but Erlang is also used.  There is a functional written in Scala (by the way, the entire website of the school is written in the Play2 framework in this language).  Our programmers are regulars at technical conferences, not only as listeners, but also as speakers.  We strive to be among the most technologically advanced companies of Runet, therefore we always need strong specialists.  We understand that it is necessary to fight with competitors, first of all, with technological effectiveness and quality of solutions. <br><br>  With the help of the school of programmers, we are looking for talented young developers and grow them for ourselves.  For recent students and recent graduates, our school is a great opportunity to prove oneself in one of the largest companies on the Runet and gain practical knowledge about the development of high-load systems.  We believe that our school provides excellent practical training for people who have a good base, are willing and able to learn.  Therefore, we offer the best graduates middle-level positions in our company.  Graduates of the school work with us in a variety of teams: search, web services, infrastructure.  To date, out of 50 people from the technical department of HeadHunter 5, are <a href="http://school.hh.ru/graduate">graduates of the school</a> .  10% is an excellent indicator, and we continue to develop a well-proven program.

    <h4>  School history </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/00e/ddc/a41/00eddca41b3879f633d9f0b1600bc8ce.png"><br>  In the first set, we received over a thousand applications for school.  100 people coped with the test task.  After the interview, we selected six of the best, three of them, according to the results of our studies, got a job in the company. <br><br>  For the second school, we changed the scheme for passing the selection, adding additional automated testing (written, by the way, by a graduate of our school).  90 applicants showed the best results, and additional tasks were sent to them.  60 people successfully coped with their decision and went to the next stage - an interview with our programmers.  The enrollment was increased to 14 people, and, unlike the first school, among them were two girls. <br><br>  As in these universities, we had a session, after which 6 people were expelled.  Yes, the fact of entering our school does not mean that you will successfully complete it.  The session was held in the format of putting all homework for the first half of the training, so that for diligent students it was quite easy.  After the session, there was a small vacation, and then the students continued their studies.  We marked the end of study and the presentation of certificates by a general approach to bowling.  From the second set of schools, two people continued to work in the company as full members of the HeadHunter team.  The rest we gave recommendations to the largest IT companies in Russia.  But most importantly, graduates received real industrial development experience and knowledge that will definitely help them in their future career. <br><br><h4>  Arrival </h4><br>  This year, to get to our school, applicants will need to go through three stages.  The first is automated testing on the site.  We will send additional tasks to those who do well with it in order to test their preparation and evaluate the real code.  Properly and effectively solving all the problems, students will be invited to an in-person interview at the company's office, where they will be able to meet with the school leaders and tell us about themselves.  Following the results of all three stages, we plan to select the best 10 young specialists in the school.  We are looking for students and graduates of engineering and mathematical specialties who are passionate about programming. <br><br><h4>  Program and study </h4><br>  Within six months, they will learn modern approaches to building high-load systems and the latest software development technologies.  In parallel, students of the school will implement their own projects, gaining real industrial programming experience.  <a href="http://school.hh.ru/program">Lectures</a> and sharing of practical development experience will be given by the leading programmers of HeadHunter (among them, the lead search programmer, the head of the front-end department, the head of the operating department) and invited experts.  We work closely with companies ScrumTrek and SkillTrek, leaders in the market of technical trainings. <br><br>  We will consider issues such as modern methodologies and programming technologies (agile, version control systems, testing, code review), web application architecture (MVC pattern, SOA, REST, asynchronous web architectures, queues and message exchange), specific technologies and frameworks (Python on the example of tornado, ORM on the example of hibernate, full-text search on the example of apache lucene), algorithmic (in addition to standard efficiency estimates, we will give you real-world tasks under map-reduce and the opportunity to work with hadoop).  We will tell you how to do Highload correctly (caching, SQL optimization, database replication, fault tolerance and scaling).  We are focused on training students with good theoretical background and the ability to learn quickly, so our program is aimed at what they lack the most - practice.  We believe that a good programmer is not one who can memorize ten sorting methods, but one whose code can be read, expanded and maintained.  All these topics will be useful to them already at the training stage.  After all, they, in particular, will have to engage in the design, development and development of their own projects from scratch, working in conditions as close to reality as possible.  And these projects are carried out at a high level - last year Internet newspaper Marker took one of the school services for the new secret project of the company HeadHunter itself and even conducted an entire <a href="http://marker.ru/news/519506">investigation</a> on this matter. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8dd/2b1/dee/8dd2b1deee381a2cc398268f9bf83349.png"><br>  Study will consist of two classes a week, two pairs in the evening in the Moscow office of the company and independent work.  Since the program is quite large, we will have to deal with quite a lot.  Therefore, we pay students a monthly stipend of 15,000 rubles, so that they can concentrate on their studies and see a direct return on their actions.  Applicants for study should proceed on the basis of 6 hours of lecture lessons per week and 8-10 hours of independent work.  The time and days of classes will be agreed with the incoming students at the beginning of the training period.  Of course, during the lecture sessions in the office, we will provide you with tea / coffee and treat you with fruit / cookies. <br>  <a href="http://school.hh.ru/postuplenie">Acceptance of applications</a> for admission is conducted on the website of the school until October 14.  See you at our school programmers! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152459/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152459/</a></p>
