After 9 months, there will be new fruits of the tangerine tree.  They will be collected by people who love their work, or, more likely, simply perform automatic movements. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d2c/f4c/e40/d2cf4ce4090dc616c96496b11cd9778a.jpg" alt="image">

      It seems to me that what MS did with the release of 8 will destroy it.  He will simply leave, opening the way for others.  The niche will be redistributed by ChromeOS, MacOS, Linux and, possibly, a new player.  Here they grew to themselves quietly tangerine trees on the plantation, gave fruit.  But the gardener decided that not enough, the fruit growing cycle was shortened and shortened, they were more and more filled with pesticides, and the plants from fertilizer chloride were bent more and more. <br><br>  I will not develop the topic, it's just a preamble.  Under capitalism, a cow must necessarily <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184318/">give money through milk</a> , and then at a critical moment - a lot of money through beefing.  But only then the cow is gone.  However, we will return from the cows to our lambs, that is, to open source software. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ef/c79/57d/4efc7957db101c109ddcbab42bd79452.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  About mint </h5><br>  People after our post <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tonk/blog/212969/">about introducing open source software in small businesses</a> reasonably noticed - how relevant is the attached survey about the prospects for home use of Linux (which the respondents seem very rosy) to the topic discussed in the article?  We shipped tangerines from our humble tree growing on a Linux plantation to small businesses, and seeing the positive experience of this collaboration, we decided to aim a blow at the home segment. <br><br>  Actually at the beginning of this year, we launched the <a href="http://www.lxbox.ru/">LXBOX</a> , a mini PC based on Linux Mint.  It is designed specifically for the home user and is ready to work right out of the box.  Of the analogs that have never reached Russia, I can point out products from Compulab ( <a href="http://www.nixp.ru/news/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD-mintBox-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D1%258C%25D1%258E%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580-%25D1%2581-Linux-Mint.html">Mintbox</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/648373/">Mintbox2</a> ) with an inhuman price tag of more than 20 tr., For which you can already buy Mac mini, in this unformed niche.  In this case, Linux Mint there is not clear what.  Linux on cheap laptops is also pretty sad.  We would not risk launching a product to the market with our Linux build if there were no hundreds of corporate users behind our backs whose wishes and opinions were taken into account.  LXBOX 2 and LXBOX 3 we (GC TONK) developed together with the German company GSN, which provided consulting services both on general issues and on the platform, for which many thanks to her. <br><br><h5>  About neighbors </h5><br>  Well, everyone got the earrings.  Actually I will not do lxbox review here, who is interested - welcome to <a href="http://www.lxbox.ru/">the product site</a> and Hi-News video review, which I will insert at the end of the article.  It is better to talk about one case that happened right under the new year.  It so happened that I was in the role of Santa Claus for my neighbor.  A lively lady, looking 35-40 years old (I have known her for 15 years and all this time she looks at this age), who sews dresses and various soft interior elements.  Among her customers and Pugachev, it turns out.  What is called, "a hard disk is screwed up - it unites"! <br><br>  All her work materials and photos were stored on the HDD.  I am not an expert in data recovery, but for an hour I was able to copy them to its external hard drive with the help of special methods - fortunately, the data structure was readable.  A breakdown resulted from the movement of several gigs of <s>porn</s> pretty unique pictures with collections on a computer with iPAD.  Comp "could not drink so much" and said, "roll back - my place is empty," hung up and fell into a lethargic state. <br><br>  The dusty P4 box itself didn‚Äôt cause itself to have warm feelings and a desire to reanimate it and was sent to the garbage bin before it underwent transplantology and generously donated its DVD-RW to its descendants.  This was how one of the first LXBOXes was ordered and ‚Äúintroduced‚Äù into the sooo small business.  The neighbor was an experienced user, but lamer: on my attempts to explain what was happening, she giggled fuzzily and replied that she would not remember anything anyway, ‚Äúyou only tell me where the Internet and the Word are.‚Äù  The device is right out of the box, in addition we went to the application manager and put Picasa on it, which she used on Windows. <br><br>  I left in some suspicion that calls would begin.  Nifiga, after 2 weeks my mom crossed with her, it turned out she was clear and comfortable, and there are no questions.  Then it became interesting - she called her: there are really no questions, she enjoys it.  And so her orders, which she had to fulfill for the New Year holidays, would have risen.  What were the alternatives?  Nout / nettop with Windows?  You should also have an office for it and codecs with antivirus, at least, you can fasten it, but there was no one to do it (I didn‚Äôt smile at the prospect, and I could only advise the computer wizard to enemies, in my opinion). <br><br>  In general, he helped the man, and "put the experience."  In general, in January-February, when the device was just announced and was in the final testing, several dozen devices scattered ‚Äúin close circle‚Äù - to friends, relatives and friends of friends.  Began to joke that it is necessary to make a network model of sales, like Oriflame!  :) <br><br><h5>  About raspberry </h5><br>  I understand that here, most likely, there will be quite a lot of comments like ‚Äúwhy it is needed,‚Äù but here I am for 1 tr.  Raspberry Pi / per nn  buy a nettop on a more powerful platform.  I'm not saying that iron is innovative, we made a software and hardware solution, ready to work out of the box.  Including as a media player.  On the development of the project and new products - we will unsubscribe at Habr√©.  While the reaction of the people and the start of sales are very pleased. <br><br>  As promised, a video review at the end ( <a href="http://hi-news.ru/gadgets/videoobzor-lxbox-pervyj-v-rossii-serijnyj-pk-na-baze-spo.html">texting here</a> ) and a traditional poll on pocket sounding. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/NKEvWaJXIUc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhxJS3AHjhYHhN5rLkG7uc-2oWxCg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  PS For those who want to get more complete and structured information about the LXBOX - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tonk/blog/216787/">tyts</a> - link to my next post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/216691/">https://habr.com/ru/post/216691/</a></p>
