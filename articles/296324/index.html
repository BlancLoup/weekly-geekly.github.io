The essence of this question, in brief, was to determine whether <a name="habracut"></a>  sometime in the future, computers and computer systems have the ability to not only perform machine operations, but also the ability to think.

      This test was empirical and was named after the initiator of such a study, the magnificent and unsurpassed Alan Turing. <br>  Like many scientists, fanatically embraced by the work of his life, he was a little communicative and in tune with the general statistical society.  However, the fruits of his work gave a tremendous leap and fundamental foundation for further development and research on the basis of scientific and technological progress and further universal computerization, without which nowadays none of those who are living today represent either their future or their present. <br><br>  The essence of this research is to understand and find the path to awareness, as computers ‚Äúinstill‚Äù the ability not only to perform algorithms and calculations, but also to further prediction, and global abilities of the human mind to think as close as possible not only to processes conscious thinking, but also to the most unconscious. <br><br>  These studies unite far more affected areas than can be imagined at first glance.  Let yourself just think: many years of work by scientists from the most diverse areas, such as neuropsychology, mathematical science, game theory, statistics and the work of physicists of many generations, as well as further research on this and not only science fiction writers, reduce everything to only global a question which later turned into a still unsolved problem.  Will the machine be able to inherit at least a small fraction of the abilities of the human brain, and will it be possible later on to somehow create on this basis a kind of binary code containing the maximum data on the human genetic code? <br><br>  Unfortunately, this area of ‚Äã‚Äãresearch is still at the stage of numerous trials and experiments.  However, due to the peculiar "butterfly effect", this question, generated by the brains of one single person, has spawned in the minds of most generations so many processes that led us to the era of total mobile presence in the limitless Internet space. <br><br>  For marketers, this development tendency made it possible to acquire the most powerful tools of influencing their target customers and sophisticated, but certainly also practically automatism-driven methods of influencing the minds of humanity spending their time online. <br><br>  So, the term ‚Äúprogrammatic‚Äù is controversial and causes heated discussions even among its faithful companions.  Many people believe that the word ‚Äúprogrammatic‚Äù itself inadequately describes the range of advertising purchases, emphasizing that everything is done automatically.  As if robots completely replace humans. <br><br>  However, participants in the discussion at the Premium Programmatic 360 Summit, held in New York, stressed that the most effective software products are cybernetic in nature and imply human intervention as well as robot actions. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe human factor will always be fundamental,‚Äù says Rick Greenberg, CEO of the Kepler Group, a digital agency that has separated from MediaMath.  ‚ÄúAnd robots make it possible to scale RTB-activity.  Machines can make instant decisions, but people still need people to get the information they need to make decisions. ‚Äù <br><br>  Advertisers, agencies and sellers of advertising seeking to push advertising purchases in the direction of programmatic, have the unenviable task of proving the benefits of these principles to people who are not interested in them. <br><br>  ‚ÄúProgrammatic is certainly perceived by many market players as a threat,‚Äù said Rob Burns, senior vice president of pricing and planning for the media holding Gannett Company.  ‚ÄúOne of the obstacles is that sales managers see programmatic as a serious competitor.  But this is fundamentally the wrong course. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúI think that soon programmatic from a sales channel will turn into a sales tool,‚Äù explains Rob Burns.  ‚ÄúThis is a learning issue.  Your sales staff must understand that programmatic is not the enemy.  Moreover, this is the best way to reach your audience. ‚Äù <br><br>  In particular, it can significantly increase the relevance of media procurement. <br><br>  Ray Reid, North American programmatic head at Neo @ Ogilvy, prefers not to think about the mechanisms of buying programs, but focuses solely on the benefits that he brings. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe try not to talk about technology or the platform,‚Äù he says.  ‚ÄúWe are talking about the benefits that this extremely complex ecosystem provides.  Its complexity and stops customers who have neither the time nor the desire to understand the intricacies.  We are talking about the capabilities of technologies that allow brand owners to complete their tasks. ‚Äù <br><br>  This strategy should attract top marketers.  But, praising technology and immediately starting with a description of the ecosystem, you can come across an impenetrable wall of incomprehension or unwillingness to listen.  One can hope that the employees responsible for advertising campaigns will start working with the RTB ecosystem only after senior marketers become interested in this system. <br><br>  These discussions are highly relevant today, when programmatic purchases have reached a certain level of maturity.  In recent years, programmatic buying has gone beyond the strict framework of RTB, which the market dictated earlier, and now has a direct relationship to premium inventory and even branding campaigns, which constitute the bulk of the online advertising budget. <br><br>  ‚ÄúInterest comes when people see real progress,‚Äù notes Rick Greenberg.  ‚ÄúThe balance of the scales in favor of programmatic buying will incline utility and higher returns.  True, some brands, such as CPG, which sell directly to final consumers, will not be interested in programmable purchases.  But in the era of an integrated approach to the buyer, even these companies can take advantage of algorithmic procurement. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe see programmatic as an effective means of finding new points of interaction with the consumer,‚Äù says Ray Reed.  ‚ÄúHow many times does an ad need to be shown to a user to convert it?  That programmatic makes it possible to increase the frequency of hits to the audience you need.  For example, you cannot sell soap through an online store, but you need to show it to a specific audience by creating a positive product image for the consumer.  This will be one touch point.  A billboard will be another touch.  The fact that today we can talk about a single metric indicates that in the near future many brand managers will rely on programmable purchases. ‚Äù <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296324/</a></p>
