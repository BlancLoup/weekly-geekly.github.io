Nokia 3310, which later became a cult, only gained popularity.  The device itself, which for many was the ideal of an unkillable, trouble-free phone, did not really have special protection.  In the same year, a truly protected model, the Nokia 6250, saw the light. <br><br>  <b>Nokia 6250</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/548/478/1c9/5484781c95d9b155fc76f746ad4b4674.jpg">

      This device with a strict design kept falling from a three-meter height on a hard surface, immersion to a depth of 0.5 m for 10 minutes, and its body was resistant to dust and dirt.  According to the instructions, the phone could be washed under running water in the off state.  All this suggests that the Nokia 6250 had a protection class of at least IP67.  The phone was built on a business platform, supported WAP (by CSD), had 255 cells in a notebook, organizer, stopwatch, infrared port and built-in games.  In addition, a noise level indicator was installed in the model. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Nokia 5210</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fb2/dcd/268/fb2dcd26803025542c8b51e8828d9538.jpg"><br><br>  The next protected model was the Nokia 5210, released in 2002. <br>  This model was focused primarily on young people who are actively involved in sports and tourism.  Protection against moisture is not put here at the forefront: the phone was not sealed and had only protection against splashes.  But thanks to the soft rubberized material of the case, he could endure falling and striking.  The bright colors of the Nokia 5210 case were supplemented with the ability to change the case yourself (Xpress-on shells) in case of damage or for the sake of updating the appearance.  The device‚Äôs youth-orientedness also spoke about the youth‚Äôs orientation: games appeared on the phone, and when an incoming call came, the Nokia 5210 vibrated to the rhythm of the call melody. <br><br>  <b>Nokia 5100</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bca/b22/4a0/bcab224a0296a3aba5eafd79854755fb.jpeg"><br><br>  In 2003, the Nokia 5100 came to replace the 5210. Like its predecessor, the device did not have a high degree of security, but rather had an increased resistance to damage and some protection from moisture.  The Nokia 5100 was the first Nokia secure phone with a color screen, polyphonic ringing tones, FM radio and Java support.  Additionally, you could purchase a plug-in camera.  Inherited from the grandfather 6250 phone received the function of measuring the noise level. <br><br>  <b>Nokia 5140</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ec8/987/3c5/ec89873c5f9dc6f413e5b3f48c3f856b.jpg"><br><br>  The model continued the line of youth sports phones.  Technology did not stand still - and the novelty, released in 2004, was already equipped with EDGE standard support and the Push-to-Talk function.  In addition, a VGA camera was built into the phone and it was possible to additionally purchase a GPS module.  In 2005, an updated version was released, the 5140i, which was distinguished by an improved display, support for mp3 melodies and a built-in mail client.  No changes were made to the hull design. <br><br>  <b>Nokia 5500</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/44f/d2e/c36/44fd2ec364c7c525bed8aa5a4531c174.jpeg"><br><br>  In the spring of 2006, the phone was unique for that time, a smartphone, the Nokia 5500, to be more exact. The hull was built on a combination of metal frame and rubber.  As an optional accessory, the Nokia 5500 comes with, among other things, a strap, a case with a clip, a memory card and a stereo headset with adapters.  A modification was also released for music lovers, the Nokia 5500 Sport Music Edition, in a different color scheme and with a different package.  It included a 512 MB memory card, a fitness strap and a bike carrier. <br><br>  <b>Nokia 3720 Classic</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/672/5f3/232/6725f32322c757207c21b209694168bb.jpeg"><br><br>  A continuation of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa monolithic protected phone was the Nokia 3720 Classic, released in 2009.  Externally, the phone did not look as aggressive as the previous models, it was created on the basis of the S40 and looked like quite a landline phone.  Protection was provided by a rubberized case, the back cover on the screw, plug plugs, solid keyboard and a metal frame around the entire phone.  The device already had more impressive communication capabilities, supported microSD memory cards up to 8 GB, had a built-in 2 megapixel camera with flash and a TFT display with a resolution of 240x320.  The protection class was provided in accordance with IP54. <br><br>  <b>Our days</b> <br><br>  In recent years, due to the tendency of switching to touchscreens, protected phones have practically ceased to be produced.  Conventionally, the successor of these models can be called the Nokia N8 in an aluminum case and with a protective glass Gorilla Glass.  However, he did not think specifically as a secure phone. <br>  And now it is time to talk about the newest of the phones, more precisely, Nokia smartphones, which can be called the successor of the old protected models.  It's about the Nokia Lumia 820. <br><br>  <b>Nokia Lumia 820</b> <br><br><img src="http://cdn.conversations.nokia.com.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Nokia-Lumia-820-protective-shells.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, someone will say that here the impact resistance is not a key feature of the device, but thanks to the Nokia CC-3040 protective case, the device is really well protected from harmful influences. <br><br>  Let's take a closer look at this building.  We call it Protective Shell, as this is the body, and not just a removable panel. <br><br>  "Shell" is made of two materials: polycarbonate and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, otherwise - ABS plastic, two different colors.  The primary color to choose from is yellow, green or orange, the second color is black.  Matte body, slightly thicker than the standard, but still comfortable in the hand. <br>  ABS plastic is characterized by the following properties: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Opaque material of a yellowish shade (however, there is a transparent modification).  It is painted in various colors. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Increased impact resistance and elasticity <br>  ‚Ä¢ Non-toxicity <br>  ‚Ä¢ Durability <br>  ‚Ä¢ Resistance to alkalis and detergents <br>  ‚Ä¢ Moisture resistance <br>  ‚Ä¢ Oil resistance <br>  ‚Ä¢ Acid resistance <br>  ‚Ä¢ Heat resistance 103 ¬∞ C (up to 113 ¬∞ C for modified brands) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Wide operating temperature range (‚Äì40 ¬∞ C to + 90 ¬∞ C) <br>  As you understand, taking into account such characteristics, the new Lumia 820 in a protected case is not only able to survive not the most careful attitude to itself, but also to argue on resistance to external influences with the legendary Nokia 3310. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/167921/">https://habr.com/ru/post/167921/</a></p>
