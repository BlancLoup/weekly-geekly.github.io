  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Evaluation of diplomas for the United States</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The information provided will be useful to those who plan to study or work in the United States. <br>  With my post I clarify and supplement the recent publication on the same topic of December 14, 2015 - ‚ÄúExperience of Evaluation of Diplomas in the USA (WES)‚Äù by <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/yakorolev/" class="user_link">yakorolev</a> - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/273069/">habrahabr.ru/post/273069</a> <br><br>  1. The WES organization referred to in habrahabr is part of a more global structure - the National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES).  In addition to WES, another 18 other organizations provide education credentials to US translation services.  List of NACES Organizations - <a href="http://www.naces.org/members.html">www.naces.org/members.html</a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have experience in communicating with two organizations from this list - the aforementioned World Education Services, Inc.  (WES) and the Center for Applied Research, Evaluations, &amp; Education, Inc.  (IESCAREE). <br><br>  2. The results of the evaluation of your diplomas from different organizations that are members of NACES (we will call them service providers) <b>may vary</b> .  So, I have a comment on the final result of the author of the evaluation of the diplomas of the author of the previous post: <br>  "Raw material: <br>  diploma of higher education, Kazan State University (now - KFU), Faculty of Economics <br>  PhD degree, Kazan State Technological University (now - KNITU), specialization - economics. <br>  Total: <br>  Bachelor's, Master's degrees and earned doctorate (Ph.D.) <br>  Total University Semester Credits: 156.0 <br>  Grade Point Average (GPA): 3.97 "

      <br>
      Note - in the number of semester credits assigned.  One year of academic studies at a university in the USA is approximately equal to 30 semester credits. <br><br>  In my case, the source material: <br>  Maroon Specialist Diploma Saint-Petersburg State University of Technology and Design, Russia.  Specialization - Computer Science / Information Technology. <br>  The result: "This is considered equivalent to the University of the same field, approximately 150 US semester credits equivalence)." <br><br>  The five-year specialist program was equated to 150 US semester credits equivalence (30 US semester credits * 5 years). <br>  This is a result of the second organization, Center for Applied Research, Evaluations, &amp; Education, Inc.  (IESCAREE).  Satisfied with the result, theoretically, they could have equated to Bachelor's degree only.  With the organization of the WES, my relationship did not work out. <br>  The author of the previous post, WES, assigned earned doctorate (Ph.D.), but at the same time, she gave only 156 semester credits for a PhD diploma.  This is ~ 8 years of study, as I understand it? <br><br>  3. Also, the author of the previous publication, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/yakorolev/" class="user_link">yakorolev</a> , did not mention the need to send the original diploma of secondary (complete) general education - a school diploma.  And its liner.  The insert with the naming of the items you listened to and grades in the US system is called Transcripts. <br>  Those, in my case, sending the originals of both transcripts (school and university) was mandatory.  As far as I understand, WES may also have a requirement to send out a school certificate and an insert, in addition to the university diploma and the insert. <br><br>  4. Course-by-Course evaluation is needed if you plan to enroll in a US university and it is more expensive than General evaluation, which is sufficient for employment purposes.  With General evaluation, you do not get the equivalent of GPA (Grade Point Average), which is assigned in the range from 0.0 to 4.0.  As far as I understand, the 3.97 GPA rating from the author of the previous publication is also a burgundy diploma.  This is a very high GPA and undoubtedly an achievement! <br><br>  5. Apostilles.  Very important point.  Apostils are quite expensive in the Russian Federation.  Plus, you need a notary's certification of apostilles. <br>  In my case, I was already in the US and I did not have the opportunity and desire to engage in obtaining apostilles.  Also, there was no desire to pay for this substantial amount of expenses that the author of the previous publication paid. <br><br>  So, most likely, not all organizations are members of NACES so demanding on Russian apostilles and notaries, like WES.  Some organizations from the list are quite enough original diplomas.  In my case it was Center for Applied Research, Evaluations, &amp; Education, Inc.  (IESCAREE). <br><br>  I just physically did not have the opportunity to return to the territory of the Russian Federation and pay substantial money for the apostilles that have risen in price and for the services of Russian notaries.  Those apostilles and the associated costs and bustle described in the previous post are optional. <br><br>  I suppose that with the "correct" apostilles a diploma will be better than without them.  But on the other hand, these are substantial expenses and not in all cases this option is available when you are already in the United States. <br><br>  6. Costs.  Theoretically, they can be zero.  An employer in the United States can pay for the evaluation of diplomas. <br>  Usually, however, Applicant himself pays.  My employer originally paid me, then, for the renewal, I myself already.  The discount for renewal compared to the initial evaluation is 50%, in my case. <br><br>  7. Extension of the evaluation.  In my case, the evaluation report is kept by the provider organization for 3 years.  You can extend its storage for every 3 subsequent years at a discount of 50% of the base value.  Advantage - the extension does not require re-sending the originals of the organization to the provider, which can save substantial amounts if you are not located in the United States. <br><br>  8. Conclusions: education is your investment.  If the diploma is protected - it is the completed degree.  The assigned degree and number of semester credits are fixed, as it were. <br><br>  In the case of an incomplete education (diploma is not protected) - a high probability that this will not be any significant asset.  And to improve their status, most likely, they will have to look towards getting an education in the US system. <br><br>  PS It would be interesting to get a comment on your publication from the author of the publication on Habrahabr ‚ÄúThe experience of the evaluation of diplomas in the USA (WES)‚Äù by user <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/yakorolev/" class="user_link">yakorolev</a> <br><br>  Maybe I missed something, but how I could, I described my experience and added to the previous publication that interested me. <br><br>  Good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297458/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297458/</a></p>
