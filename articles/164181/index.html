  <section class="page js-page"><h1>JOBS Act promises explosive growth for IT companies in the US</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On April 5, 2012, Barack Obama signed the acclaimed JOBS Act (the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act).  This law <s>document</s> will allow companies to attract initial investment under a simplified procedure.  This is very interesting for entrepreneurs in general and IT entrepreneurs especially.  And since everyone can create a company in the United States, the new law has riveted the attention of entrepreneurs all over the world. <br><br>  Now the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has begun a public discussion of its initiatives regarding by-laws for the implementation of the JOBS Act. <br><br>  About JOBS Act (as a beautiful infographic 1.79 MB) and possible pitfalls of its implementation, read under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now in the US, a startup, without becoming a public company, can attract capital only from qualified investors.  Investments in a startup at such an early stage are considered risky, and in order for these risks to be taken only by people willing to evaluate them, the concept of a qualified investor was introduced.  This is considered to be the one (company or individual) who has more than $ 1 million, not including the cost of basic housing, or annual income for each of the last 2 years&gt; $ 200K, and if married -&gt; $ 300K including spouse income).  This, of course, complicates the procedure for raising funds for new businesses.

      In the US economy, lately, things are not very good and they are constantly looking for ways to stimulate its growth.  We agreed that the main engine of growth is an entrepreneur and therefore it is necessary to support him in every way.  The rapid development of crowdfunding platforms also served as a trigger for this.  Projects that have only a prototype, collect millions on KickStarter, create businesses and, obviously, jobs. <br><br>  <b>It is expected that the JOBS Act, according to which businesses will be able to receive investments from ordinary citizens, will further spur the process of creating and developing start-ups in the country.</b>  <b>Those.</b>  <b>Now, by creating a project on a KickStarter-like platform, you can get not only the buns or the product itself, but also the shares of a startup you like as a reward.</b>  <b>This is what can cause the expected explosive growth: after all, it‚Äôs one thing to get a T-shirt, and another thing - a part of something like Facebook‚Äôs shares while it‚Äôs still in the garage.</b> <br><br>  So, each startup will be able to attract up to $ 1 million per year from ordinary people - details on infographics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/12b/701/3bb/12b7013bb92d4ca42a162fafd5691baa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  SEC-approved sites for accepting funds from the public in exchange for shares have not yet appeared, but the queue has already lined up.  It is worth noting that the number of such investors in one firm is probably limited (no more than 500). <br><br>  JOBS Act will fully enter into force in January 2013. In the meantime, the US Securities Commission (SEC) has announced a public discussion of its initiatives regarding secondary legislation for the implementation of the JOBS Act.  You can notify the SEC about your views on the JOBS Act and read interesting opinions from US businessmen (and from all over the world) <a href="http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/jobsactcomments.shtml">here</a> . <br><br>  SEC, beware, habraeffekt on the approach. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.businessnewsdaily.com/3104-jobs-act-explanation.html">Link</a> to the "article" with the infographic and <a href="">link</a> to the infographic separately. <br><br>  <b>In addition to the JOBS Act, there is another interesting initiative called the STEM JOBS Act - this is a special type of visa (F4) for foreign students who have been educated in the United States.</b> <b><br></b> <br><br>  Americans understood the obvious: most students from other countries graduating from a university in the United States then return home and develop the economy of their home country.  Until recently, the United States did not provide such students with the opportunity to stay in the United States, but now they can do it. <br><br>  A new type of visa (STARTUP VISA) is also planned for entrepreneurs - you can learn more about these initiatives from my next articles if you are interested (thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/webpilot/" class="user_link">WebPilot</a> for an invite). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164181/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164181/</a></p>
