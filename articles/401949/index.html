  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Multicolored Smart Kettle: Review of the REDMOND SkyKettle G200S</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In November 2015, Geektimes readers were <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/265616/">told</a> about the Internet Kettle REDMOND SkyKettle M170S.  A distinctive feature of this model is the support of remote control functions - both within the home and from anywhere in the world.  The electric kettle was released as part of the REDMOND Smart Home line of devices (REDMOND, by the way, was the first in the world to sell a whole line of smart home appliances), and in just one year the REDMOND tea department grew to half a dozen models with control support from a smartphone.  One of the new products is the REDMOND SkyKettle G200S.  If you pick up loud titles - perhaps this is the world's first "smart" kettle-lamp.  The main feature of the device, in addition to control from a smartphone, is the presence of a custom multi-colored backlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fab/466/ec6/fab466ec674546e6a53c6ea9312f15fb.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Let me remind you, REDMOND Smart Home is a huge number of all kinds of home appliances that you can manage from one application, Ready for Sky.  Of course, the program is available for both smartphones and tablets on Android, and iOS.  A total of four categories of household smart appliances are presented:

      Sky Kitchen - various kitchen appliances, including multicookers, electric kettles, coffee makers, kitchen scales and breadmakers; <br>  Sky Home - heaters, fans, plinths, irons, sockets and even window cleaning robots (I will tell you about this miracle in one of the next reviews); <br>  Sky Fitness - this direction is currently represented only by smart floor scales; <br>  Sky Guard - reed sensors (monitoring the opening / closing of doors or windows), motion sensors and "smart" sockets with Wi-Fi (in fact - with the function of the "hub" of sensors and devices REDMOND Smart Home). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98c/dbe/705/98cdbe70535c4e7c9d49e20ef167ffbb.jpeg"><br><br>  The main common feature of all models is to support two options for remote control.  The first is a direct connection of a smartphone / tablet via Bluetooth, the second is that you leave the intermediary device at home (the same smartphone), through which you control a smart gadget at any distance, from another continent via the Internet from your personal phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb1/d89/43a/eb1d8943a7414f4d900c72b5a47ad3a5.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Technical Specifications of REDMOND SkyKettle G200S</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Power: 2 200 W <br>  ‚Ä¢ Body materials: glass, plastic, metal <br>  ‚Ä¢ Case color: black <br>  ‚Ä¢ Volume: 2 liters <br>  ‚Ä¢ Management: buttons on the handle;  remotely from a smartphone or tablet on iOS version 8 and above or Android version 4.3 and above through a special application <br>  ‚Ä¢ Key backlight: LED <br>  ‚Ä¢ Manufacturer Warranty: 2 years <br><br><h2>  Appearance and controls </h2><br>  What exactly you can not blame designers REDMOND, so it is in the absence of taste.  No matter how hard I tried, I still could not find at least one smart REDMOND device that would not look organically in an apartment with a modern interior.  The electric kettle REDMOND SkyKettle M170S attracted a black glossy case with an intricate pattern of flowers, a kind of high-tech version of models with a ceramic case, which are almost always decorated with paintings.  The REDMOND SkyKettle G200S that came to me belongs to the type of teapots with a glass tempered glass bulb - that is, 80% of the case is transparent, which in itself makes the device extremely cute.  However, other manufacturers still manage to spoil the "exterior" of glass models - they will introduce a coarse plastic top and spout, then they will make an unsightly thick handle with high protruding buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/106/720/e4b/106720e4bab740189eef8bb47f4fd9b1.jpeg"><br><br>  In this regard, there are no issues with the REDMOND SkyKettle G200S.  The base is made of a plastic circle, decorated at the top and bottom painted with chrome rims. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3c/4fa/5d7/f3c4fa5d73f04982a28d552011f62b52.jpeg"><br><br>  A similar decorative inset is present above the spout, as well as at the top in the center - on the lid opening button.  REDMOND is not in a hurry to take the electric kettle from me, so I can respond to the fears that the ‚Äúchrome‚Äù parts will crawl away.  As a result of almost three months of active daily operation, I did not notice any scuffs or traces of the ‚Äúbase radiography‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e8f/c7e/3d5/e8fc7e3d56d54e2c976750db440f335f.jpeg"><br><br>  All plastic elements are made of soft-touch matte material.  Clearly durable and flexible, it will not crack when falling and hitting a ‚Äúhard‚Äù ceramic floor.  There is no problem of marquess per se, plastic elements are resistant to fingerprints and other dirt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/026/2bf/386/0262bf38697f4a43896b68cd8c538f6c.jpeg"><br><br>  The metal ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù at the base of the heating element is AISI 304 steel. The manufacturer writes about this: ‚ÄúIt is used to make high-quality dishes and kitchen appliances.  AISI 304 differs in the lowered content of carbon, in its structure - to 10% of chrome and 17-19% of nickel.  Such a composition makes 304 steel very durable and resistant to corrosion even in aggressive environments.  Steel products AISI 304 are durable: they are not afraid of sudden temperature changes, the effects of salt and fresh water, acid-alkaline solutions, as well as excellent resistance to mechanical damage and the appearance of rust. " <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/132/e7a/b1f/132e7ab1fe284c5dbadb737b4bb3ead1.jpeg"><br><br>  A kind of minus - if you ever used an electric kettle of the level of REDMOND SkyKettle G200S, then most likely you will never again buy a typical inexpensive model for 500-700 rubles for yourself.  For example, at the very beginning of my life together with my wife, when buying various utensils, a teapot of one of the Chinese brands with a European name, which is being sold for about 700 rubles, was purchased.  A typical such device, which does not seem to look like the last Chinese, and is inexpensive.  So, after meeting the electric kettle REDMOND, I absolutely do not want to go back to the ‚Äúold friend‚Äù.  It's like a change from a good fresh foreign cars back to the old Zhiguli.  The quality of plastic, assembly, design, in the case of REDMOND is "another universe." <br><br>  The main controls are located at the top of the handle.  This is quite a popular solution in today's electric kettles, which replaces the archaic, in my opinion, lever at the base of the device.  In conventional models with buttons on the handle, as a rule, one key is responsible for turning on / off the boiling process, and the second is for lifting the lid.  In the REDMOND SkyKettle G200S, the available buttons were used with greater functional benefit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/080/f9b/b41/080f9bb4134c488f948c97b2a6a38c0d.jpeg"><br><br>  On the left, as you might guess, is the start / stop boiling button.  But the right one allows you to set the heating temperature without this boiling.  By pressing the right button, we select between 40, 55, 70 or 85 ¬∞ C.  All four options are signed on the handle of the kettle, a bright blue diode lights up above the selected indicator of heating. <br><br>  I will especially note how the buttons are made.  This is literally a few millimeters raised tubercles with a clear, not tight pressing.  First, especially from an aesthetic point of view, it looks much more attractive than the rough, protruding keys.  Secondly, it is purely subjective - I suspect that the work resource of the REDMOND SkyKettle G200S keys is significantly higher than the typical controls in other electric kettles.  In my cheap teapot, the only button quickly got loose. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/027/254/4d1/0272544d12b2414782a1353bdc18bb76.jpeg"><br><br>  By the way, the vast majority of manufacturers prefer to implement the function of the thermostat in the form of a panel built into the electric kettle base.  As a rule, with touch buttons.  I understand that this is a ‚Äúpebble‚Äù in the garden of the REDMOND SkyKettle M170S, but still - such a performance in fact increases the size of the device and the space occupied on the table.  Say, when I had to return the REDMOND SkyKettle M170S and SkyKettle G200S was sent to replace it, the first thing that my wife noticed was the visual and the real decrease in the space occupied by the kettle (even though the ‚Äútwo hundredth‚Äù model is 0.3 liters larger) . <br><br>  In my case, it just so happened, on a small square tabletop, there is a stand for spoons, a jug Barrier, a couple of glasses, the kettle itself, here all the food manipulations on the cutting board take place.  Therefore, my ‚Äúlike‚Äù deserved exactly REDMOND SkyKettle G200S.  But if you have no problems with the space on the table in the kitchen, feel free to ignore this paragraph.  The same REDMOND SkyKettle M170S, for example, is larger in size, but it looks simply luxurious.  And as the blue backlight of the panel is reflected from the black glossy case - it must be seen, the words are powerless. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80f/915/b8f/80f915b8f31a43f1b193ff372b5317e1.jpeg"><br><br>  And another touch - to me personally, as experience with both REDMOND models has shown, I prefer ordinary physical buttons, rather than touch-sensitive performance. <br><br><h2>  In the work.  Control the temperature </h2><br>  Agree, it is difficult to say anything special about how a smart kettle boils water.  There are no odors, due to the transparent flask it is easy to control when you need to remove scale.  Here, perhaps, that's all.  In addition, I have a strange habit - like tea or coffee, I never bring water to a boil, turn off the process at about 70 ¬∞ C.  The drink still turns hot, without having to wait until it goes from the ‚Äúburn your mouth with boiling water‚Äù stage to ‚Äúyou can drink‚Äù.  With a transparent bulb, it was easier for me to determine the optimal moment of shutdown.  And then I remembered that the thermostat is built into the REDMOND SkyKettle G200S :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/050/5ae/a8b/0505aea8b59e4ac0a5275e70807a837c.jpeg"><br><br>  Apart from controlling from a smartphone, the most remarkable additional feature is the ability to choose the heating temperature.  There are two important points here.  The first - as I have already indicated, on the handle of the kettle there is a choice of three options of temperature, minimum - 40 ¬∞ C.  In the review of the REDMOND SkyKettle M170S, this has already been mentioned; it is this temperature that is optimal when preparing artificial milk formulas for newborns.  If you are personally faced with the need for artificial feeding instead of breastfeeding, SkyKettle M170S does not have to explain the enormous benefits to you.  For those who are just preparing to replenish the family, I will allow myself a small ‚Äúdisclaimer‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fab/a1f/1bb/faba1f1bb1ef4a81810617279921c6f7.jpeg"><br><br>  Ideally, after the birth of the child, his mother provides the infant with breastfeeding.  However, for several reasons, parents have to transfer the child to feeding with an artificial mixture from a bottle.  Say, mother simply does not have milk - it happens often.  Or the child has persistent allergies, and long-term attempts to identify an allergen in food or medications taken are not successful.  For the mother, this is a huge stress and, what is worse, constant experimentation with restrictions on food up to reducing the diet to a minimum.  The transition to artificial feeding means that, depending on the age of the child, it will be necessary to prepare the mixture up to ten times a day and until the child reaches two years of age.  If you do not have an electric kettle with a thermostat - get ready for the fact that during each preparation of the mixture you have to boil water first, and then use a thermometer to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù cooling to 40 ¬∞ C. <br><br>  The second important point - not always the presence of the thermostat means that the kettle will be useful for young parents.  REDMOND SkyKettle G200S - rather the exception, in the majority of models from other manufacturers, the minimum set temperature starts from 50 ¬∞ C. <br><br>  Tea connoisseurs are well aware that an ordinary teapot is in no way suitable for true gourmets - for many varieties, boiling water simply kills the taste and aroma.  For example, the gyokuro variety is recommended to be brewed at 60-65 ¬∞ C, yellow tea with thin leaves - at 85 ¬∞ C.  As you can see, the REDMOND SkyKettle G200S with only three labels in some cases is useless.  Like many other kettles that allow you to set the temperature only in 10 ¬∞ C increments.  But!  Looking ahead, I‚Äôll say that the Ready for Sky mobile application contains a choice of temperature in the range of 40-90 ¬∞ C in 1 ¬∞ C increments!  So the REDMOND smart model for tea gourmets looks preferable to the absolute majority of electric kettles with a thermostat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/97f/497/b4b/97f497b4ba3e4dee84a05184f8a1fe2e.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, I almost forgot.  The kettle maintains auto-heating of the set temperature for up to 12 (!) Hours.  The usefulness of this option is difficult to overestimate - is it not enough for some cases distract, while you put the water to boil.  And in the case of preparing infant formula, the function will not be superfluous - the child will have a billion only known reasons for him to capriciously and not to let his mother into the kitchen.  And then, if it were not for heating, each time it would be necessary to re-set the cooled water to boil. <br><br><h2>  Internet features and Bluetooth </h2><br>  The organization of control of a smart electric kettle from a smartphone is no different from that of any other equipment with Ready4Sky technology support.  First of all, go to the App Store or Google Play and download the Ready for Sky application.  Only before this we are convinced that our device supports Bluetooth 4.0, and the OS - not lower than iOS 8.0 or Android 4.3.  Then open the program, register an account, then the utility independently searches for REDMOND devices within a radius of 50 meters (that is, the Bluetooth coverage area).  From the resulting list, select the desired device and carry out a simple procedure of "pairing" the smartphone and home appliances.  As a rule, the whole process consists in holding the certain button on the REDMOND model 4-5 seconds before the sound signal, the electric kettle under test is no exception. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb3/823/a90/eb3823a90bfd4aa99c0618c7151e841c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/541/602/927/5416029274d44a7b869ef7213cfeec49.jpg"><br><br>  REDMOND provides for its technology two options for remote control.  The first is a direct Bluetooth connection, when the control of devices is limited to a radius of 50 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e11/953/bbb/e11953bbb04b437aacfa4484ceb239ce.jpeg"><br><br>  Suitable option within the house or apartment.  Although not everyone agrees.  For example, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/kamikaze/" class="user_link">Kamikaze</a> in the comments <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/265616/">suggested</a> : <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThe range of bluetooth in many apartments will turn into‚Äú within the room ‚Äù, being in the same room with a kettle does not press a button on it, but get a phone from your pocket, launch the application and press a button there?</i>  <i>It is doubtful.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The idea with a smartphone-gate is truly epic, I have never met such crutches :) ‚Äù</i> . <br><br>  And indeed, I have an ‚Äúelongated‚Äù two-room apartment, in fact, the place of my main ‚Äúdwelling‚Äù and the location of the kettle are two points as far as possible.  Between us are two thick concrete slabs.  And in my mind I was preparing that for the tests I would have to contact the device via the Internet.  The bottom line is that the fact remains that the Bluetooth connection in the REDMOND technique is not afraid of large distances in apartments, I did not observe any loss of connection and connection problems.  Therefore, commentators would still like to see not a pessimistic theory, but real examples, if any, of connectivity issues.  Either I completely admit that among the readers of the material there will be specialists who will clarify in the comments when the signal may actually deteriorate.  It will be useful for me and other users to take note. <br><br>  The second option means that you can connect to the REDMOND SkyKettle G200S via the Internet from anywhere in the world and control it just as you would at home.  However, this scenario requires an intermediary gadget.  The connection scheme is as follows - in our case, the electric kettle via Bluetooth is connected to an intermediary smartphone, the latter, via Wi-Fi or 3G / 4G, has access to the Internet.  The phone has the R4S Gateway program installed, logged into your account and synchronized with the kettle.  Everything, now the teapot will be online 24/7.  If you are at work or on the way home, just run Ready for Sky, in the upper right corner click on the Bluetooth icon and switch to the online connection mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/018/a56/118/018a561182914eb6b7dda406f0ec1f23.jpeg"><br>  <i>On the left - the ‚Äúhome‚Äù smartphone is connected to the kettle via Bluetooth and becomes an ‚Äúaccess point‚Äù.</i>  <i>On the right - my personal smartphone that, via LTE-Internet, has full access to the management of the REDMOND SkyKettle G200S from anywhere in the world.</i> <br><br>  It is clear that not every citizen has an extra smartphone.  Besides, it‚Äôs not a fact that there is a Wi-Fi access point in the REDMOND equipment location.  Let's say if the kettle is in the garage.  For such cases, the company has in store the REDMOND Gateway offer - a smartphone with a pre-installed R4S Gateway application and a special tariff from the MTS REDMOND Smart Home.  The set costs 3 495 rubles.  As for traffic, do not worry, the monthly fee for the tariff is 10 rubles per 5 MB, which is enough to manage even a dozen REDMOND gadgets. <br><br>  In what cases is remote control via the Internet useful?  The main variations have already been considered in the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/265616/">review of the</a> REDMOND SkyKettle M170S, and in the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/redmond/blog/264310/">article</a> on the line of "smart" technology REDMOND.  In my opinion, the most typical scenario for home use is the ability to turn on the kettle in advance when you return home from work.  By myself I know that the least hungry laborer on returning to the apartment would be willing to spend time on cooking, and a ready portion of boiling water will definitely not be superfluous.  You can quickly organize tea / coffee, speed up the preparation of porridge / pasta, immediately pour boiling water into the pan, or steam yourself "Doshirak" if you are a gourmet.  In the same way, a remote launch of a kettle, in order to immediately arrange a hot drink for yourself, will come in handy, say, on returning from a long walk or driving to the shops on a day off.  Of course, first of all, we are talking about winter and autumn - you are unlikely to wish to be pampered when there is a shade in the yard at + 30 ¬∞ C. <br><br>  Within the home, a direct Bluetooth connection has even more options for using a remote connection.  For example, when you wake up in the morning, you can not get out of bed and barely open your eyes to turn on the kettle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/129/f49/b45/129f49b4555a41fc99d30411ff0d42d2.jpeg"><br><br>  While the morning toilet will be performed, the REDMOND SkyKettle G200S will boil water and maintain the temperature for an indefinitely long time.  Or when you do not want to once again run into the kitchen.  Yes, this is not relevant for one-bedroom apartments and in cases when reaching the kettle is literally two meters.  But in my two-room apartment with a long corridor from my desk to the kitchen - all 11 meters.  To run two times back and forth I absolutely do not like.  Again, if there is a baby in the family, it‚Äôs not a fact that it will be convenient for you to once again run into the kitchen. <br><br>  Of course, any good thing you can try to denigrate and present in the most negative light.  For example, as <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/alexpp/" class="user_link">alexpp</a> did.  I quote: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThis is how the picture presented itself - mom, playing with the child, wanted to boil water.</i>  <i>To do this, find a mobile phone (which lies far away so that the child does not get it), starts there to search for the application icon for a connection with a teapot, then it does some other actions in it - presses the big red power button for example.</i>  <i>All this time, the child, seeing something interesting in the hands of the mother, is trying to pick up this mobile phone for himself, or to push something on it, or to bite it (child!).</i>  <i>As a result, the inclusion of a kettle instead of a ten-second trip to the kitchen will be poured into the minute + fighting with the child for the phone. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  And this is how it happens in practice - it takes just 6.7 seconds from the moment the smartphone appears in the hands until the boil is started.  If it is worth unlocking on a fingerprint, without an additional graphic key or lock screen - even faster.  And the activation button, as you can see, is not ‚Äúbig red‚Äù, the whole menu is decorated in calm blue tones. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bKmS56ArtPo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In conclusion, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/alexpp/" class="user_link">alexpp</a> writes: <i>‚ÄúIMHO the meaning of such devices is in simple and fast remote switching.</i>  <i>And in the current version, the inclusion translates into a dozen actions</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  Well, we clearly saw that the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù kettle of the REDMOND SkyKettle G200S completely falls under the ‚Äúmeaning‚Äù described. <br><br><h2>  Mobile application with color music </h2><br>  It‚Äôs certainly not difficult to get used to the Ready for Sky application ‚Äî even a teapot ‚Äî the interface is logical and simple, so you definitely won't need the help instructions.  The main section "Management" contains three tabs.  ‚ÄúBoiling‚Äù is a quick start of heating up to a hundred Celsius, degrees in the center of the circle show the temperature of the water in the kettle in real time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73b/c6a/7f8/73bc6a7f8f174fc09bcc39d2c1728861.jpeg"><br><br>  The ‚ÄúHeating‚Äù tab - if necessary, here we choose to what temperature the water should be heated.  There are four options in the quick menu, but if you click on the image of the thermometer, the access to temperature adjustment mentioned above will appear in increments of one degree in the range of 40-90 ¬∞ C. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d1/994/c28/7d1994c28cc64b4b82b626c05bcd973e.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4a/a9c/e26/b4aa9ce26e37433c9c5e15843736806d.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúBoiling and heating‚Äù - activation of boiling with subsequent maintenance of water temperature at a given level. <br><br>  Also there is the ability to turn off all the sound signals of the kettle.
