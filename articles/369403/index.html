He turned the ventilation in the bedroom and kitchen to accelerated air exchange in order to prepare the atmosphere for a hectic morning activity.  He raised the temperature in the bedroom by two degrees, to the daily mark, so that it would be easier to get out from under the blanket.  I started the water heater in the bathroom so that at the time of washing it would be enough for you, your wife and another for shaving.  Added a light lemon scent to the supply air stream.  Began a smooth increase in illumination in the bedroom.  Launched a thermopot in the kitchen for heating water for coffee, and a slow cooker for fruit porridge.  While you swore furiously with the cat and wife, he watched the cat's bowl and blinked in vain as a reminder.  After the owners left, they filled the reserve bowl with dry food so that the animal did not go hungry.  He turned off the thermostat, the water heater and forced ventilation, opening the passive flow valves in the windows.  Reduced indoor temperature to acceptable for indoor plants, watered them.

      All this, of course, is funny and curious, but what is there ritmanalysis in the title? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c94/3b0/05e/c943b005e55e48069be93056facb37cc.jpg"><br><br>  Ritmanalis is such a trend in architectural science.  It was invented by the French philosopher and sociologist Henri Lefevre.  It seems he just loved to look out the window.  And in his spare time from this fascinating occupation - to walk and look around.  And he wrote a book (in fact, not one), in which he taught others and told a lot of interesting things about how people's livelihoods affect space.  But the pulse of the city is a large-caliber topic, there are some rhythms with a period of tens of years, for a small article this is too long.  But to try to catch and ‚Äútame‚Äù, that is, to use for their own purposes, the rhythms of one house is quite possible. <br><br>  <b>To begin with, what are the ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù points of input and output?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f73/8af/665/f738af665ded4e3f80bdb64d8cce036c.jpg"><br><br>  It receives information through sensors (light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide level, movement, sound, etc., etc.), it can track the opening and closing of doors and windows, switching on and off electrical appliances, and even recognize the image from the cameras. <br><br>  The house can react to stimuli by turning it on and off and changing the mode of various devices, opening and closing doors and windows, notifying the owner of any events. <br><br>  It is logical that by analyzing and searching for patterns in the incoming flow of information, a more appropriate range of reactions can be set up.  For example, energy saving has long surprised no one. <br><br>  <b>What rhythms can affect the life of a single household?</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afd/5f6/40a/afd5f640a7584717bf108466a801be1f.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/955/47e/808/95547e808b434f72839783ca020d038c.jpg"><br><br>  First, it is the <b>daily (they are circadian) rhythms of</b> each inhabitant, including animals.  They constitute a rather complicated combination (like the addition of oscillations in physics).  Of course, a full-fledged chronogram of the house itself will not be able to, how it knows that you are scratching the cat's belly between dinner and tea, but it is quite capable of marking your regular presence in the same room. <br><br>  <b>Weekly rhythms.</b>  If the work schedule of one of the households is not 5/2, then they will again form a bizarre pattern with repeatability not weekly, but monthly, or even more.  There will be days when everyone is at home, when there is no one, when someone is alone, and his cyclogram becomes the leader for the control system. <br><br>  <b>Annual rhythms.</b>  Changing seasons, changing the length of daylight hours, air temperature and so on.  They also affect weekly and daily cycles (approximately as modulation of a low-frequency control signal by a high-frequency carrier).  For example, in winter you dress and undress longer, you want to sleep before, cook other dishes, prefer other types of recreation, change the ratio of home and outdoor stays. <br><br>  <b>This is all theory, but how can these graphs come in handy in life, what can be calibrated with their help?</b> <br><br>  Yes, in general, any ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù system can be adjusted using rhythm analysis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/362/9f5/501/3629f5501737429cb3b6e79987def444.png"><br><br>  For example, <b>ventilation.</b>  If any doors in the house are closed, they divide it into compartments between which air exchange is difficult.  Even if you do not have a separate weather station in each room, you can calculate the volumes, take into account the flow and exhaust points and adjust the power of the mechanical air flow, opening the ventilation valves or air vents so as to maintain a comfortable atmosphere in each ‚Äúcompartment‚Äù.  Accordingly, when at home all and all doors are open and when at home someone is alone and all doors are closed, the ventilation will work very differently. <br><br>  <b>Lighting.</b>  About the opportunity to arrange a smooth ‚Äúdawn‚Äù with a bluish lamp for easy waking up was already at the beginning.  But providing indoor plants with the optimal length of daylight in any weather and season using a special lamp is different, you can optionally set the annual and daily cycles and simulate the length of the day and the amount of light for any latitude.  Depending on the time of the year, the hour of the day or the day of the week, the spectral characteristics of the lighting can be calibrated.  For example, if you work at home during the day, then it is worthwhile to use cold white if necessary at this time so as not to confuse the body, pulling its clock back and forth.  And in the evening - warm white and yellow, which act soothingly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/db6/4d5/bc4/db64d5bc4e824245a07cd380e9582977.jpg"><br><br>  <i>And this is a picture from a study on the translation of the biological clock of the human body <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article%3Fid%3D10.1371%252Fjournal.pone.0030037">using different types of lighting</a> .</i>  <i>A smart home can also do this, if it is good to ask.</i>  <i>For example, if you arrived from a vacation with a change of time zone.</i> <br><br>  <b>Temperature.</b>  It is worth noting here that a person loses heat not only because of contact with air.  Contact with objects, radiation, evaporation of moisture make a greater contribution.  Due to this, at different times of the year, the same air temperature can be perceived very differently due to different temperatures of the surrounding surfaces and different clothes on a person.  You can calibrate heating and air conditioning in order to take into account these factors and the wishes of residents in an automatic mode, without creating situations where the battery is operating at full capacity under an open air vent. <br><br>  <b>Humidity.</b>  It is connected with ventilation and heating inextricably, but unlike them, some of its sources are dynamic: it is the residents themselves moving around the house, constantly exhaling steam, sanitary facilities and kitchen, used in cyclical mode and creating different amounts of steam at a time, these are plants whose gas exchange is subject to the daily rhythm.  Accordingly, humidifiers can also be controlled not at random. <br><br>  <b>How does the paradigm of a smart home with ritmanalism differ from the usual one, and how to embody it?</b> <br><br>  Recall the difference between ‚Äúbuilding automation‚Äù and ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù: one simply executes a set of embedded scenarios, the other implements some adaptive algorithms, allowing to achieve greater economy, security or comfort during its operation.  Ritmanalysis is just one of these adaptive mechanisms in the ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/401/cbc/ab7/401cbcab7dd543ec87d358b88c46fb10.gif"><br><br>  At the entrance, the module has ‚Äúdefault‚Äù set of scenarios for managing the ‚Äústuffing‚Äù at home, tools for collecting and analyzing various statistics, including the behavior of inhabitants and cases of their manual intervention in their work.  The output is a constant ‚Äúdopilivanie‚Äù individual programs for the selected performance criteria and a variety of combinations in order to minimize the cases of manual control.  For example, if two people live in a house with very different ideas about bioclimatic comfort, you get a combination of subroutines: ‚ÄúA is home alone;  warm, dark and humid ‚Äù,‚Äú only B houses;  cold, light and dry ‚Äù,‚Äú house A and B;  several tradeoffs depending on the weather and time of year ‚Äù,‚Äú there is no one;  minimum power consumption, maximum security ‚Äùand more subtle cases like‚Äú A sleeps, B is working;  break the house into two zones with different parameters ‚Äù. <br><br>  The system obviously requires a fairly long period of normal manual control for training and calibration, because the annual cycle for a week cannot be formed, and in the short term it needs to filter one-time fluctuations from periodic peaks.  And this is hardly a budget solution, at this level of technology development.  However, the result should be the same symbiotic object, repeatedly described in the NF, by analogy with the form of ‚Äúhomo sapiens sapiens‚Äù that deserves the name ‚Äúsmart smart home‚Äù.  The level of non-adaptive ‚Äúsmart houses‚Äù with its minuses is also described in the NF, for example, in Bradbury in the short story <a href="http://rbradbury.ru/budet.html">‚ÄúIt will be a gentle rain‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  In general, if you spend time collecting and analyzing information, you can find a lot of interesting things (or you can not find it: all people are different, and they have different houses, and concepts about comfort).  Just do not forget, in addition to numbers, to take into account your own subjective impressions and wishes, because the ‚Äúobserver‚Äù is an essential tool for rytmanalysis and the main source of the actual analytical component. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369403/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369403/</a></p>
