Many publications have written that Pebble was specifically launched before the announcement of Apple Watch, in order to have time to collect cash before the release of the giant.  And now they are discussing whether it is worthwhile to take Pebble Time with a new force, after March 9, Apple told all about its watches, which will appear on the shelves on April 20 against the delivery of Pebble Time in May. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d79/5f5/1b0/d795f51b06e4386feb80491e667e9533.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Let's compare Pebble Time and Apple Watch.  Personally, it seems to me that these are quite different products for only partially overlapping audiences. <br><br>  Another thing to add is that earlier Pebble announced a steel version of its new creation, which, in its gold version, is very similar to Apple's smart watches. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d6/8f8/27e/7d68f827e50366e9ad7b7bf5d7f45690.jpg" alt="apple watch we pebble time" width="600" height="431"></a> <br><br><h2>  Price and terms </h2><br>  Expensive steel version of Pebble Time is now at Kickstarter will cost $ 250 + $ 15 for shipping worldwide.  In the retail version, this version will cost $ 299.  At the same time, there is a cheaper version of the watch for $ 179 + $ 10, which will be sold in Russia at a price of 16,990.  The estimated delivery month for Kickstarter predictions is May for the base version and August for the steel version. <br><br>  Watch from Apple will cost $ 349 for the cheapest Sport option with a display of 38 mm and $ 399 for a display of 42 mm.  A more expensive watch model will cost from $ 549 to $ 1049 + $ 50 for the same, but with a 42 mm display.  Well, a golden gadget will cost from $ 10,000.  At the same time, on April 10, pre-order will start, and the gadget will be on sale on April 24 in nine countries of the world (Australia, Great Britain, Germany, Hong Kong, Canada, China, USA, France and Japan).  About Russia this is not yet. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/552/cb0/30b/552cb030b5df8665bdaa41729db52ba4.jpg" alt="0910_apple-iwatch_2000x1125-1940x1091" width="600" height="337"></a> <br><br><br><br><h2>  Design and execution options </h2><br><br><h4>  Apple Watch. </h4><br>  Watches from Cupertino have many options.  You need to choose a model, then the display size, material, color, and after that available straps. <br><br>  The models are called Watch, Watch Sport and Watch Edition, and each model can be equipped with a 38mm or 42mm high display.  Both options can be configured for right-handed or left-handed. <br><br>  Standard Watch model is represented by two types of case: stainless steel and black stainless steel.  And a choice of a number of different straps of leather and other materials.  The watch, by the way, is equipped with a sapphire crystal. <br><br>  The Watch Sport version is made of anodized aluminum in silver and space gray and Ion-X glass.  Straps to choose from are given: white sports, blue, green and black. <br><br>  Watch Edition will be made of yellow or new gold with sapphire protective glass.  There is a choice of straps here, but the price of the na is appropriate.  The watches will cost from ¬£ 8,000 to ¬£ 13,500 ($ 10,000 to $ 17,000). <br><br><h4>  Pebble Time Steel. </h4><br>  Due to the convenient fastening, any straps 22 mm wide fit the watch.  And as a protective glass is used Gorilla Glass. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea8/756/b86/ea8756b86a79e36bea6d8a654370c674.jpg" alt="apple-watch-vs-pebble-time-comparison-5" width="600" height="451"></a> <br><br><h2>  Display and Navigation </h2><br><br><h4>  Apple Watch. </h4><br>  Although the watch has a small 38 or 42 mm display.  This is a full-fledged retina with a touchscreen, made using AMOLED technology.  It will be protected by Ion-X or Sapphire glass depending on the version. <br><br>  The main feature in the navigation is the Digital Crown, which is practically invented anew.  Earlier in the clock, it was used to wind the clock and set the correct time, but now its functionality has become much better.  Her owners of the gadget can scroll and zoom elements displayed on the display.  Also, the crown is a button with the Home function. <br><br><h4>  Pebble Time Steel. </h4><br>  The new Pebble watches have an energy-efficient color e-Ink display that displays 64 different colors and is updated at 30 frames per second.  And it is protected with glass Gorilla Glass 3. <br><br>  Unlike the competitor, the display at Pebble is not touch.  But the watch has as many as 3 buttons for navigation (one is responsible for past events and incoming notifications, one for current affairs and playing music, and one for future plans and events). <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fdc/f2e/3d3/fdcf2e3d370afa74ef658b19761e01d2.jpg" alt="apple-watch-6_1" width="600" height="400"></a> <br><br><h2>  Software </h2><br><br><h4>  Apple Watch. </h4><br>  Watch from Apple just bursting with functionality.  A smart retina display is ready to display any information in conjunction with a smartphone.  All that users operate in everyday life - in a convenient form will be displayed on the wrist.  Add here the touchscreen display and special gestures optimized for the watch screen, the new WatchKit, Apple Pay and all other features and applications of the Apple Ecosystem. <br><br><h4>  Pebble Time Steel. </h4><br>  Of course, Pebble has an established application store, with which the new version of the clock will work properly.  But 6,500+ applications and screensavers look weak against the background of the AppStore, which is simply breaking from the iPhone app.  It should also be noted that the highest quality applications for Pebble have always been from the developers of the watch, although the latter have released a convenient programming environment and strongly support third-party developers. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/030/cbc/d52/030cbcd52c0082327f76198733ab64d6.jpg" alt="sdk-739x420" width="600" height="341"></a> <br><br><h2>  Battery </h2><br><br><h4>  Apple Watch. </h4><br>  The creation of Tim Cook can keep the battery in normal operation for up to 18 hours.  This means that they will have to be charged daily.  For this purpose, a convenient induction magnetic charging.  The technology is similar to MagSafe in laptops. <br><br><h4>  Pebble Time Steel. </h4><br>  The normal version of the watch will have to hold a charge of 7 days, but the steel one will already have 10. This makes the watch the most long-lived from a single charge on the market.  Power is also carried out using magnetic charging, which is attached to a special connector on the clock. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/793/f3d/76c/793f3d76c3394e543d24e598a9b79f60.jpg" alt="PebbleTime-StrapDisconnected" width="600" height="400"></a> <br><br><h2>  Other features </h2><br><br><h4>  Apple Watch. </h4><br>  Apple repeated many times that their watches are the most personal product they have ever produced.  Apple Watch should become the center of user interaction with the digital world and a center for collecting useful information.  A heart rate monitor is built into the watch, and GPS data is taken from a smartphone.  Also declared the following functions: <br><ul><li>  tactile vibration and built-in speaker for combined user interaction </li><li>  Special Apple's S1 system-in-a-package chip </li><li>  Accelerometer </li><li>  Bluetooth 4.0 </li><li>  Siri support </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Pebble Time Steel. </h4><br>  Pebble has no medical sensors out of the box, but there is a motion sensor for counting steps and the ability to connect wristbands with built-in peripherals, like the same heart rate monitor, extended battery or GPS.  Also, the watch boasts the following chips: <br><ul><li>  Improved backlight </li><li>  New Cortex M4 processor </li><li>  6-axis gyroscope </li><li>  Smart port for accessories (for connecting peripherals built into the bracelet) </li><li>  Waterproof case </li><li>  Tactile buttons for blind control </li><li>  Quiet vibrate notifications </li><li>  Support for international characters (even Chinese) </li><li>  Fitness tracking via third-party applications such as Misfit and Jawbone. </li></ul><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/359/cc4/080/359cc4080305cd2cfbf9108daa3588a0.png" alt="pebbletimesteel-8.0" width="600" height="400"></a> <br><br><h2>  Compatibility </h2><br><br><h4>  Apple Watch. </h4><br>  The clock will work with iPhone 5 and up.  IOS 8.2 is required for work, which was also announced at the presentation on March 9. <br><br><h4>  Pebble Time Steel. </h4><br>  Pebbles will be able to make friends even with iPhone 4S and above, as well as with Android 4.0+ <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eed/aff/b8b/eedaffb8b4631468a3443b526d23a262.jpg" alt="pebble-time-vs-apple-watch" width="600" height="390"></a> <br><h2>  What to choose? </h2><br>  If you are an Android user, or you want to take a cheaper watch, then you definitely should pay attention to Pebble.  But, if you are an iOS adept and want the maximum functionality from the clock, then you will fall into Apple Watch. <br><br>  The Apple Watch has a better display and already has, so popular now, a heart rate monitor on board.  But they keep charging all day, against ten days at Pebble. <br><br>  In order to somehow summarize the functionality of the watches that are now or very soon will be released on the market, I suggest also to get acquainted with the following table. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f7/07e/0c4/0f707e0c4704519eb3864f674d3ca5b1.jpg" alt="apple watch comparison_02 (1) .png" width="600" height="714"></a> <br><br>  The article is based on <a href="http://www.pocket-lint.com/news/133053-apple-watch-vs-pebble-time-steel-which-one-should-you-choose">this material</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377299/</a></p>
