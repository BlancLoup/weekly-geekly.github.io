  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Give Internet, Yota-Magister</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It so happened that, for work reasons, I got a MobileWiMAX modem from the glorious Yota company.  I tell you, dear readers, about my impression. <br><br>  Let's start with the work of the modem made by Samsung for Yota under the GNU / Linux OS.  Historically, I don‚Äôt use alternative OSes at all, such as MacOSX or Microsoft Windows, in my work and everyday life, but I work exclusively under GNU / Linux (the specifics of work and personal worldviews).  Thanks to the guys from the MadWiMAX team, they wrote a driver supporting Yotov modems under GNU / Linux.  I tried to collect it under Gentoo at home on a large laptop, but there it was unnecessary for me, but it did not meet, because they wanted something strange, they wanted to convert their mana somewhere, but did not find it with something, and when it found I did not understand how to do it, well, it's not about that. <br>  On the service netbook, I use eeebuntu, because I consider it a strange idea to put Gentoo on a working machine on a netbook.  Packages for Ubuntu GNU / Linux were found by me, installed and everything immediately went up and worked.  Respect Yote and the driver development team. <br>  On this you can talk about the hardware, except to make an addition, which sometimes, every few days, in spite of a more or less stable connection, the connection disappears somewhere before the modem is juggled. <br><br>  Now I will lead the story of coverage, speed and other delights. <br>  Coating.  There are several places where coverage is critical for me, on Ugreshskaya, where our office is located, on Voikovskaya, where I live, well, also in a couple of points.  I checked not only in them and saw the problem here: on Ugreshskaya, although it is shown on the map, the place of good coverage in our building itself is caught only on the window, and even then on a specific one, the speed is from 1 to 3 megabits per second, at home 2nd Novopodoskovny lane is caught better, the speed is the same, in the center of the city there is something sad in general, in my favorite Belfast pub it is not caught at all, although it is in Novokuznetsk, in the cafe in China town where I checked it was caught but badly, the speed is less than megabit, only the window has a signal.  In the park on the same Voykovskaya where I live, it was caught much better than at home and the speed was at a peak of up to 6 megabits per second.  Here are about such layouts I found on the coverage and speed, well, let's write it off for the recent launch. <br>  Other charms are of course the fall of Yota (or rather the fall of the billing system, as I understand it, expressed in the inaccessibility of the personal account) on the day of the commencement of commercial operation.  Colleagues, they do not do that, they should have prepared better.

      General conclusions of a third-party person from provider Yota: <br>  1. Start good <br>  2. Coverage even in Moscow should be developed <br>  3. At the moment can not be used as the main channel <br>  4. For backup channel 900 rubles a month is a bit too much (especially considering the following item) <br>  5. It is necessary to provide real IP users as soon as possible. <br><br>  Somehow like this.  If anyone wants details, ask questions.  Ready to answer :) <br><br>  ps </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/62200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/62200/</a></p>
