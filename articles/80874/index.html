  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How I searched for the post office phone number</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h1>  Instead of the preface </h1><blockquote>  Postal service in Russia is an integral part of the state infrastructure.  Due to the extensive network of post offices, it brings together residents of all, even the most remote and hard-to-reach settlements. <br>  [...] <br>  Today, the postal industry in Russia is personified by the federal enterprise - Russian Post.  For several years now, this organization has united the country's largest network of post offices, one of the largest working groups of postal workers. <br>  [...] <br>  As a result of the structural changes, the company has become attractive both for individuals, who can now take advantage of a wide range of diverse services in post offices, and for corporate clients who are offered Mail network services. <br>  [...] <br>  Russian Post is actively working not only to expand the range of services provided to the public, but also to improve their quality. [...] <br></blockquote><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  And how it all began ... </h2><br>  It all started with the notification of the receipt of mail transfer.  I needed to know the exact time of work and some more information.  What have I done for this?  Of course, I typed in the search line of Yandex "Mail of Russia".  The first response of the search engine was a link to the <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/" title="Post of Russia">official</a> mail <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/" title="Post of Russia">site</a> .  Immediately struck by the speed of the server response: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/921/a0f/4da/921a0f4dad34cacd0105714ba3b36070.png" alt="ping to mail"><br>  impressive, right?  If someone doubts that the matter is in the mail site, here is a ping to Yandex: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d04/c44/9f3/d04c449f38b6de6162a6afdf7d04bd10.png" alt="Ping to Yandex"><br>  what is called: "feel the difference." <br><br><h4>  We are looking for a phone number and post office address </h4><br>  "Well, with the site, with the site," I thought, and went in search of the coveted number.  Finding the right section of the site is not the easiest thing to do, but it's not so difficult to be indignant about it.  Much more interesting is what you see after processing the request by the server and issuing the <a href="http://info.russianpost.ru/servlet/department%3Faction%3Dshow_info%26depID%3D35786" title="result">result</a> : no - not terrible photos (which at the time of writing the notes are not loaded at all), phone department! <blockquote>  <strong><em>The telephone number is +7 (254) 7‚Äì98‚Äì65</em></strong> . </blockquote>  If someone from Habrasoobshchestvo is not up to date, then I will say that since January 2007 a new dialing procedure has been in effect for the MO (and indeed for the whole of Russia), namely, the order +7 - 2 ab xxxxx, has been replaced by the order + 7 - 496 ab where: <ul><li>  "2" code of the Moscow region; </li><li>  "Ab" - area code; </li><li>  "496" - the geographic code of the Moscow region. </li></ul><br>  that is, for a call to the post office, for the third year, instead of +7 (2 54) 7‚Äì98‚Äì65, dial +7 (496) 547‚Äì98‚Äì65 (this is, by the way, the phone book of the Sergiyev-Posad department, and the phone is offices completely different). <br><br><h4>  We continue the search - a conversation with the "help desk" </h4><br>  "Well, with the site, with the site," I thought again and dialed the toll-free help desk number.  I will not lay out the details, I will only say that I called 2 times.  The first time the girl gave me the same number that is on the site.  I tried to convince her that she wouldn‚Äôt get through to this number, to which she replied: ‚ÄúThis is the only information I have and I cannot help you anymore.‚Äù  I understand the girl.  I demanded to give the phone to the chief, demanded to find a person who has information about the telephone numbers of the branches - the answer is the same.  At the end of the conversation, the girl tactfully sent me and hung up, cutting off my monologue in mid-sentence.  The second call was more successful, the girl gave me the phone of the Ministry of Communications and something else where a pleasant woman listened to me patiently, sympathized with me and said that she could not help with anything, because even though the superior organization didn‚Äôt have authority over the mail It has.  Here is a story, citizens.

      Lastly, I will add that the story happened in mid-February, the situation on the site, as of January 15, 2010, is the same.  I did not send angry letters to the post office (although I was recommended to do it, but I decided that it was a waste of time), I think to send them a copy of the note, let them read it.  Such an absurd and ridiculous story happened to me. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80874/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80874/</a></p>
