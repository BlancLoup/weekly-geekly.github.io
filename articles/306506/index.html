Think of a conflict in a team, tensions when working on a difficult project, or personal clashes. <br><ul><li>  Tell us about the period when you had to work closely with a person whose character was <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-prichin-dlya-obshcheniya-s-lyudmi-kotorye-otlichayutsya-ot-vas/">significantly different from yours</a> . </li><li>  Give an example of the conflict that you faced while working in a team.  How did you handle it? </li><li>  Describe a situation in which it was difficult for you to build relationships with someone influential.  How did you overcome it? </li><li>  We all make mistakes that we would like to correct.  Tell about a problem with a colleague that you would like to solve otherwise. </li><li>  Tell about the time when you needed to get information from someone who didn‚Äôt want to share it.  What did you do? </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Customer communication skills</font> </h2><br>  If the position you are applying for is related to working with clients, be sure to prepare for one of these questions. <ul><li>  Look for an example of how you successfully presented your company or team and superbly served the client. </li><li>  Describe the situation in which making a good impression on the client was extremely important.  What did you do for this? </li><li>  Tell us how you did not meet the expectations of the client.  What happened and how you tried to rectify the situation? </li><li>  Tell about the moment when you were sure that the buyer was satisfied with your service. </li><li>  Give an example of communication with a complex client.  What was the situation and how did you get out of it? </li><li>  Working with a large number of customers, it is difficult to provide excellent service to each of them.  How do you prioritize, focusing on the needs of your customers? </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Adaptability</font> </h2><br>  Shocks necessarily bring some benefit!  Recall the recent work crisis that you have successfully overcome.  Even if your behavior at that moment did not seem successful to you, think about what lesson or positive moment you have learned from the situation. <br><ul><li>  Tell us about the period when you were under severe pressure.  What happened and how did you survive it? </li><li>  Describe the moment when certain changes took place in your company or team.  How did this affect you, and how did you adapt? </li><li>  Tell us about your <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/karera/9-neveroyatno-uspeshnykh-lyudey-i-pervaya-rabota-kotoraya-sdelala-ikh-temi-kto-oni-est/">very first job</a> .  How did you learn? </li><li>  Remember the situation in which you had to think on the go to gently extricate yourself from a difficult or delicate situation. </li><li>  Tell about <a href="http://testutor.ru/blog/uroki-kotorye-izvlekli-iz-svoix-neudach-7-ochen-uspeshnyx-lyudej/">your failure</a> .  How did you handle the problem? </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Time Management Skills</font> </h2><br>  In other words, be ready to talk about the time when you combined numerous duties, (excellently) distributed them and managed to do everything ahead of time. <br><ul><li>  Tell us about the period when you had to be a great strategist to take into account all your priorities. </li><li>  Describe the long-term project you led.  How did you ensure that work was progressing <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/sekret-o-tom-kak-vsye-delat-vovremya/">on schedule</a> ? </li><li>  Sometimes it‚Äôs just impossible to do everything on a to-do list.  Tell us about the moment when you had too many responsibilities.  How did you behave? </li><li>  Tell about how you set a goal.  What have you done to get what you want? </li><li>  Tell us about the period when you performed <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/12-sovetov-dlya-povysheniya-produktivnosti-pozvolyayushchikh-kontrolirovat-svoy-rabochiy-den/">many duties</a> .  How did you do everything? </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Communication skills</font> </h2><br>  Most likely, you will have no problems with the story for communication questions, because this is part of not only the majority of posts, but also everyday life.  However, it is important to remember: you should also talk about your thinking process or preparation. <br><ul><li>  Remember how you managed to convince someone at work to look at the problem from your point of view. </li><li>  Tell us about the time when you were a full-time technical specialist.  How did you get everyone to understand you? </li><li>  Give an example of a situation where you had to rely on written communication channels to get your ideas across to the team. </li><li>  Describe the moment when you needed to explain something rather confusing to an annoyed customer.  How did you deal with this delicate problem? </li><li>  Tell us about the good presentation you gave.  Why do you think she was a success? </li></ul><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Motives and Values</font> </h2><br>  Many seemingly random questions are actually designed to better understand your motives.  Ideally, your answers should relate to this aspect, even if the questions are not straightforward. <br><ul><li>  Tell me, what is your own professional achievement that causes your greatest pride? </li><li>  Tell me how you encountered a certain problem and took the initiative to resolve it, and did not wait until someone else did. </li><li>  Tell about work under very strict or, on the contrary, extremely weak supervision.  How did you feel? </li><li>  Give an example of your <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/3-sposoba-stat-bolee-kreativnym/">creative approach</a> to work.  What inspired you, and what caused the difficulties? </li><li>  Tell about the period when your work did not bring you satisfaction.  What could be done to improve the situation? </li></ul>
