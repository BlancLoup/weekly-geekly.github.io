The requirements for such systems are much higher than for ordinary home devices, because the operating conditions are noticeably different: in the sun in summer it can be +60, and on a winter night the temperature drops to -30 -40.  In all these modes, the router must function and provide the user with communication.  Therefore, in such systems, sealed boxes and components of another class are used. <br><br>  As a rule, the external router is a sealed box with an antenna and a router that is powered by PoE.  This method of power allows you to extend to the external device just one cable, instead of two: power + data.  I chose a couple of popular models that are able to provide the user with a decent level of network access.  Let's compare their characteristics.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pm/a7/bi/pma7biiajf5zj9ivlczxak0bhe4.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Microdrive NR-410</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r6/h9/rg/r6h9rgymnxvfvdwzrzt82xoy6_w.png"><br><br>  We meet a rather curious router from the Russian manufacturer.  It is interesting because it is relatively inexpensive - less than 11 thousand rubles.  This is comparable to a good home router and an external antenna from my tests earlier.  The device itself is sealed and consists of two parts: antenna + router. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q5/on/ah/q5onahpodguhpafjrebez2qokte.jpeg"><br><br>  In this case, the antenna is more like a type of "gun" than the usual panel.  It has a polarization, which is indicated on the reverse side. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qh/oq/__/qhoq__yybpwcisz3xun6esekpvo.jpeg"><br><br>  The router has an installation space for a standard-sized SIM-card.  Also, the user will need to connect the pigtails from the antenna to the router.  That is, in order to prepare the device for work, you need at least a screwdriver and no fear of the equipment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7y/vv/5c/7yvv5c4hjrihy00vxtg0hcisnic.jpeg"><br><br>  According to the manufacturer, the router can operate at temperatures up to -40 - for this, the board has a warm-up system before starting.  The scope of delivery also includes a mount on the mast.  That is, the user will need to purchase additionally only a sim card of a suitable operator and a bar / mast on which the device will be mounted. <br><br>  The router has a built-in Wi-Fi module with an omnidirectional antenna inside.  Thus, a wireless access zone is created around the antenna.  If you just come to the country with gadgets that do not require a wired connection, this will be enough for comfortable work.  You can simply plug the power adapter into an outlet, direct the antenna to the base station and enjoy network access. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ub/4f/8l/ub4f8lkddfe-sdgodnso1dodqem.jpeg"><br><br>  It should be noted that the firmware is being regularly updated and shortly before the release of the article a new release was released that allows you to organize a VPN network using the OpenVPN and L2TP protocols.  Thus, you can create a private network with work or with your home, organizing the free exchange of data, as in a local network. <br><br>  <b>Zyxel LTE7460</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ns/cs/qs/nscsqsjdppludxrwqoxmy66azpc.png"><br><br>  This router was already on my test and showed good speed and reliability.  It is noticeably more user friendly, if only because it would not be necessary to disassemble it to start work.  The sim card and cable are connected without disassembling the unit, so even a screwdriver is not required.  But I could not look inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xx/tr/rk/xxtrrkiqr7f5bkwle4htirbtmf8.jpeg"><br><br>  In a sealed box, there is a router board and a panel antenna on a PCB inside.  Its gain is 8 decibels, which is almost twice less than that of a Russian competitor.  The back cover is made of metal and serves as a radiator for the heated elements of the router. <br>  The router is not equipped with a Wi-Fi module and is connected to it only by cable.  It also comes powered via a PoE injector, included in the kit.  The device also supports the organization of closed VPNs via PPTP or L2TP, but does not support OpenVPN.  Yes, and firmware are released infrequently: the date of the most current at the moment - December 2017. A good package includes a convenient bracket for mounting on a mast or bar. <br><br>  <b>Testing method</b> <br>  As in all my tests of mobile routers, I adhere to the same measurement method, so that the data can be compared, and the experiment was repeatable.  The test was conducted on a weekday during the daytime, when summer residents do not yet exist, but ordinary users are at work.  In this way, a small BS load is achieved and real data transfer rates can be obtained in normal conditions.  One of my experiments showed that the highest download speeds can be expected from 1 to 4 in the morning, but who needs such indicators when we use the Internet mostly during the day? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hn/y1/z6/hny1z6ueu4f40n-1lwry-ss7xsk.jpeg"><br><br>  Data transmission was carried out over 4G (LTE), since this channel is dedicated to data and is not loaded with voice traffic.  The measurement itself was carried out using the Speedtest.net service, and each measurement was taken three times in order to level out random speed jumps.  As a result, I received an average download and data transfer rate. <br><br>  <b>results</b> <br>  Even without looking at the results, we can assume that the Microdrive's router will be faster than the device from Zyxel, because it has an antenna with a large gain.  In addition, I will provide the RSRP and SINR parameters, which are crucial for data transmission over the 4G network. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cd/g_/i8/cdg_i81fenx63capst8ilce8g-i.jpeg"><br><br>  And now it's time to look at the test results.  The download speed of the Microdrive NR-410 was 31.59 Mb / s versus 23.48 Mb / s for the Zyxel LTE7460.  In principle, both routers allow you to quite comfortably view videos in FullHD or surf the net.  The difference of 8 Mbit / s is not very significant for a single user, but if you work with large amounts of data or like to shake, then 8 Mbit gain will be noticeable.  But as for the data transfer, the NR-410 noticeably took the lead: 20.57 Mb / s versus 7.2 Mb / s. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vw/-a/js/vw-ajsnz5lqddptfvaure3ijgas.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ty/0w/vz/ty0wvz2yxtsw2jp2czggoau1wxs.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Results</b> <br><br>  It's time to take stock.  The router from the Russian manufacturer Microdrive came out faster, more productive and more functional than the Zyxel.  It noticeably overtakes in speed, but in terms of initial preparation for work is inferior: the user needs to tinker with a screwdriver, connect tiny pigtails himself.  In this regard, the implementation of the Zyxel preparation for work looks better: unscrew the airtight cover, insert the Sim card, and you can connect.  On the other hand, such a setting in the Russian router must be made once before starting work, and then only use the device and enjoy mobile access to the network. <br><br>  It should be added that the Zyxel router supports channel aggregation.  With better signal quality and base station support for the operator of this function, the LTE7460 can theoretically provide greater speed.  But in the conditions of remote location of the BS, the antenna with a large gain factor plays a crucial role.  Therefore, in ideal conditions for maximum speed, we can recommend the Zyxel LTE7460, and in the case of removal from the BS for a decent distance, it would be better to take the Microdrive NR-410. <br><br>  <b>BONUS</b> <br><br>  I noticed that quite often, where the mobile Internet is used, there is a video surveillance system.  Sometimes it's just cloud cameras, and sometimes there are systems with a DVR.  With rare exceptions, mobile operators do not allocate a white IP address to users, which means that they will not be able to connect to such cameras or the NVR: you need to create a VPN network with a server that already has a white IP.  In Russia, there is a team that has found a solution to the problem and created its own <a href="https://birevia.com/">Birevia</a> service.  This is port forwarding from the white IP address to your router.  This is implemented simply: a white IP address and a range of ports are issued.  The router connects via PPTP or L2TP protocol to the VPN server and the dedicated ports on your router are forwarded to the desired device.  But we need to distinguish between the VPN service and port forwarding: merging devices into a VPN network will not work.  In addition to video surveillance cameras, you can also forward other services if required, but the main customers of the service use this service in this way.  But there is one BUT!  A router should be able to forward ports not only from the WAN interface, which receives and sends data to the network, but also from the VPN channel. <br><br>  In general, the port forwarding service to a gray IP address is very interesting.  Thus, it is possible to ensure the operation of closed services for NAT of any systems, and not just video surveillance when accessing via mobile networks.  In general, the service is interesting and free trial access is also available. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458444/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458444/</a></p>
