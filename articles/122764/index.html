  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How BlackBerry makes planning and life easier for me</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have been following the tape on Habr√© for a long time and found myself thinking that almost all the articles, with rare exceptions, are devoted to phones ‚Äúnot with that operating system‚Äù, which I like the most.  Yes, Android is good and I admire Google, yes, Nokia was a giant at one time, and no one thought of anything else as a phone, yes, the time came for ‚Äúunisex‚Äù, be it wrong, and the touch-interface of the iPhone along with With great marketing, Apple has won millions of "mobile hearts" around the world ... <br>  But I am a ‚Äúfan‚Äù, ‚Äúmaniac‚Äù and ‚Äúminion‚Äù of Research In Motion (RIM). <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I agree with the majority opinion that the phones of this company occupy a certain niche, as they say, for a certain circle of people, ranking primarily among this circle: businessmen, office clerks and so on.  Believe me, this is not the case for a long time.  BlackBerry (BB) has ceased to be a business smartphone since RIM released the so-called "youth" model.  I will not conduct an excursion to the Hall of Fame, but go straight to the point. <br><br>  In the wake of the heyday, as I call it, the stress regime at work in the West, and we have become a fashionable trend in time management as GTD (Getting Things Done).  The Wiki on this occasion broadcasts the following: (Russian. ‚ÄúBringing cases to completion‚Äù, however, more often - ‚Äúhow to put things in order‚Äù) is a time management method created by David Allen and described in a book of the same name.  In a nutshell: free your head from what can be placed elsewhere. <br><br>  Why am I doing this, and the fact that almost every one of us has a good half of the time of day holding the phone either in our hands or somewhere close by.  Most use the phone for its intended purpose - call or call back.  But not everyone uses the phone as an advanced organizer, the place where you can put everything, due to the fact that some do not need it, others do not have the opportunity, and still others do not know how to implement it.  I suffered from the fact that during a squall of calls during rush hour, without having to hang up, I had to answer the calls again and again, losing the thread of the previous conversation, and, accordingly, losing some important information.  For example, a really important meeting next week, or the need to send a letter and a heap of small things that make it impossible for business to stand still.  There was an idea, and why, after talking with the subscriber, the phone (in our case, BB) cannot offer to perform any action - something like a ‚Äúreminder‚Äù?  My good friend and ‚Äúally‚Äù suggested this possibility, and later realized it.  Moreover, at the time of writing this article, the program was overgrown with considerable baggage of skills and knowledge, received a ‚Äúcut‚Äù and turned into simply indispensable, for me at least.  So, actually meet - Follow Up Reminder. <br>  The program is not very demanding on the resources of the smartphone, takes up little space in the processes and the traffic (for many precious!) Does not use.  It does not need the presence of branded services (BIS), therefore, it is possible to use it without them.

      My first desire, of course, was to lay out a million pictures and a description to make on three sheets.  But, I will confine myself to the main points that are very important to me.  Moreover, the program has a trial period of 7 days and you can study all the charms and settings for free. <br><br>  The first and most important thing - after a conversation with the subscriber, by the way, whether it is in your address book or not, a dialog box appears asking you to schedule an action for the contact - Meeting, Call, E-Mail, Task, Call E-Mail, Task from Inbox.  The function I use most is the call, select it;  then we are asked to set a time when to call - within 10 minutes after the call, Today, Tomorrow, Next working day, etc .;  having chosen the ‚ÄúTomorrow‚Äù program, having interrogated my calendar of meetings, kindly gives me the opportunity to choose the EXACTLY that period of time when I am free.  Thus, in order to create a label (read note) in the calendar, I literally make 5 clicks with the trackpad, with one finger.  This circumstance is really appreciated when you sit behind the wheel and write something, typing on the keyboard for a long time (I have a BlackBerry 9780) is simply an unaffordable luxury.  Oh yeah, if someone called you during the period when you were talking, the program again saves the information in the form of a reminder - ‚ÄúIs there no need to do something with this unsuccessful conversation?‚Äù <br><br>  The second thing that makes me wildly delighted is the end-to-end ‚Äústitching‚Äù of the ‚ÄúRemind me‚Äù dialogue in all applications.  In other words, being on Twitter, I can bring up the program‚Äôs dialogue and put the meeting on a calendar with any contact, having dated this meeting, to some event that I learned about from Twitter, for example.  Moreover, if I have a contact email address in my address book, I can immediately send him an email. <br><br>  In the first versions of the program, this function was not available, and, unfortunately, it was not implemented in the operating system itself ‚Äî adding the telephone number unknown to my address book to an existing contact.  Now this function is and perfectly copes with the task, allowing you to add a number to the contact with the choice - Home, Work, Work 2, etc.  Restriction only on the number of fields in the Address Book map. <br><br>  Quick SMS for me was a real help for me.  Imagine: a meeting, an important call that I don‚Äôt want to miss, but the interlocutor is also interrupted ‚Äúnot from the hand‚Äù ... We repulse the call and the program gives us the opportunity, with two clicks, to send SMS, templates of which we previously added to the settings - I am in a meeting.  I will definitely call you back later. ‚Äù  Another advantage of Quick SMS is the ability to send them immediately after the call: - Could you send me all the information by e-mail?  - Of course, dictate the address!  (and here you understand that it is difficult to dictate your address, on the other end of the wire it is not very well versed in English letters and also ‚Äúcarriage and small cart‚Äù of obstacles).  I just take off the ‚ÄúQuick SMS‚Äù (from the template) where several of my addresses are clearly and without errors.  The man at the end does not wait, expending a minimum of effort, and I and he.  The same is with the office address and all that you use every day - the address of your site, the route to the base, the current account and much more you can think of. <br><br>  How important it is sometimes to build a chain of talks by telephone with one of the partners, or simply to understand: how many calls, what time, how long did it last.  The program can keep a log of calls, recording each of the events in the calendar.  Fortunately calendars can create multiple.  I use one exactly how the call log collector synchronizes with my Google account and is calm that I can always find any call. <br><br>  This is exactly what I use.  This is exactly what I now really need for productive work.  This is exactly what allows me to free up space in my head for other tasks, freeing up my time, and sometimes the time of my partners, clients, friends, etc.  And yes, I do not use this program 100%.  The developer still introduces new functions into the program, releasing all new versions of the program, and he uses it by 200%.  The fact that the program is bought is also among the buyers of addresses .... @ Apple.com, ..... @ Rim.com and, of course, ‚Äúsimple‚Äù users.  It upsets that I don‚Äôt use all the functions myself, it upsets that many also don‚Äôt need all the functionality, it‚Äôs upset that RIM treats software developers in such a piggy way. <br>  This is one of the must have programs on my BlackBerry!  And I bet about this functionality there is no program on other mobile platforms. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122764/</a></p>
