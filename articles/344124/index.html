And here, in the village of Trimley St. Martin, <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/12/08/slowest_street_for_broadband_in_uk_revealed/">the “slowest Internet”</a> in the whole of the UK (as of December) is 0.68 Mbps. <br><br>  Locals have to wait eight hours to download a 45-minute video.  This speed is 53 times <a href="https://www.uswitch.com/broadband/speedtest/streetstats/">lower</a> than the average for the United Kingdom. <br><br>  And this is not an isolated case in the world.  In our material we will tell about other places on the planet where using the Network is a real test.

The journalists compared the “level” of local communication with the state of affairs on Everest - there the average access speed was one and a half times higher. <br><br>  In the United Kingdom there were also other places, especially in rural areas, “lagging behind” the minimum speed <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-plans-to-make-sure-no-one-is-left-behind-on-broadband-access">recommended by the</a> government of the country at 10 Mbps.  According to 719 thousand speed tests conducted by the expert organization “Which?”, 11 (out of 389 studied) municipal districts do not satisfy this requirement.  Although the average broadband speed in the UK <a href="https://www.ispreview.co.uk/index.php/2017/04/ofcom-2017-study-average-uk-home-broadband-speeds-rise-36-2mbps.html">is</a> 36 Mbit / s. <br><br>  Of course, in developed countries such problems <a href="https://www.cheatsheet.com/gear-style/why-high-speed-internet-is-so-slow-to-reach-rural-america.html/">exist</a> only in sparsely populated areas.  For example, similar situations <a href="http://www.thejournal.ie/broadband-speeds-ireland-3082026-Nov2016/">are found</a> in Ireland.  On the other hand, there are entire countries and even continents in the world that are forced to put up with “low speeds”. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.dospeedtest.com/blog/which-country-has-the-worlds-slowest-internet-speed/">According to the</a> Do Speed ​​Test on September 1 of this year, Libya is the country with the “slowest” broadband access - here more than 95% of the population has no access to the network.  The top five "slow" includes Nepal, Nigeria, Iran and India. <br><br>  Cable.co.uk examined the situation in 39 countries in Africa, and none of them <a href="https://qz.com/1052890/african-countries-have-the-slowest-internet-speeds-says-a-new-broadband-speed-report/">reached the</a> 10 Mbit / s threshold.  If we take into account the speed of the mobile Internet, then on the African continent there are countries that overtake the United States on this indicator.  For example, in Kenya, the average mobile Internet speed <a href="https://qz.com/1001477/kenya-has-faster-mobile-internet-speeds-than-the-united-states/">is</a> 13.7 Mbit / s (versus 10.7 Mbit / s in the USA). <br><br><h2>  The reasons </h2><br>  Anyway, everything depends on the infrastructure and the cost of its construction.  If we talk about areas with low population density, then the payback period of such investments is significantly different from the situation in the city. <br><br>  To illustrate, we can recall the example of South Korea, which is <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/03/31/broadband.south.korea/index.html">known for</a> fast and cheap Internet.  The population density per square kilometer is more than 500 people.  Here, given the relatively high density of buildings, infrastructure investments look much more “interesting” compared to conventional American villages, where private houses are located at a great distance from each other. <br><br>  Another reason for the "slowdown" - the lack of competition.  As a rule, in countries with fast and cheap Internet, one of the main drivers of development is <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/TECH/03/31/broadband.south.korea/index.html">she</a> .  On the other hand, in some cases, it is possible to explain the low level of competition by the fact that very few people want to “enter” the market, which requires the construction of infrastructure in hard-to-reach areas ( <a href="https://www.adn.com/features/business-economy/2017/03/18/for-rural-alaska-broadband-the-middle-mile-is-everything/">there</a> is <a href="https://www.adn.com/features/business-economy/2017/03/18/for-rural-alaska-broadband-the-middle-mile-is-everything/">no benefit</a> without support). <br><br>  In addition to the capabilities of the communication line, the direct perception of the “speed” of the connection is influenced by the way the content delivery process is organized.  For example, as of 2015, Google <a href="https://qz.com/472028/why-your-internet-connection-is-slow-wherever-you-are-in-africa/">had</a> seven data centers in the United States, four in Europe, two in Asia, one in Latin America and none in Africa.  In such a situation, the content will “get” from Google to conventional Kenya, for example from London, which will negatively affect the user experience when working with various sites and resources of the corporation.  A recent report from the Internet Society Report <a href="http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/224433/">confirms</a> that the lack of local infrastructure is one of the key problems.  That is why, for example, Netflix is <a href="https://qz.com/811003/a-new-netflix-server-in-nigeria-will-deliver-faster-streaming-and-content-to-its-african-users/">deploying</a> servers on the continent. <br><br>  The Philippines have several “excuses” for low-speed Internet in the country.  The republic <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ralphjennings/2016/02/23/meet-asias-internet-laggard-the-philippines/">consists</a> of 7100 islands, which complicates the construction of networks.  It also affects the cost of Internet access.  In 2014, island residents were <a href="http://news.abs-cbn.com/focus/04/23/14/why-philippine-internet-speeds-are-slow">offered</a> to pay about $ 20 per month for a 2 Mbit / s tariff. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_-/0p/fz/_-0pfzw-vsg5xheorifttdq1twg.jpeg"><br>  <font color="#A9A9A9"><i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/89228431%40N06/11085124946/">reynermedia</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i></font> <br><br><h2>  What does it affect </h2><br>  The quality of communication has many social and economic consequences.  It has been established that the “slow Internet” <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/13/poor-broadband-killing-rural-life-young-people-flee-cities-report/">is</a> not the last factor forcing young people to leave rural areas. <br><br>  In Lagos, Africa, where <a href="https://qz.com/1052890/african-countries-have-the-slowest-internet-speeds-says-a-new-broadband-speed-report/">a</a> modern technological ecosystem is being formed, problems with Internet access threaten the loss of both developers and their potential customers.  At the same time, even a 10% growth in the audience of Internet users <a href="http://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/224433/">may increase the</a> volume of international trade by 0.4–0.6%, if we talk about African countries. <br><br>  The problem pushes the authorities to take decisive measures and even becomes one of the factors of the political struggle (the <a href="https://philnews.ph/2016/02/20/mayor-duterte-reveals-plans-to-resolve-the-slow-internet-problems-in-the-country/">example of the</a> Philippines). <br><br>  However, not all countries seek to solve the problem of “slow Internet”.  For example, Australia <a href="http://www.news.com.au/technology/online/nbn/australian-download-speeds-languish-in-50th-place-behind-new-zealand-thailand-and-kenya/news-story/8df36cfaaff9c36669566513b0dbc38a">is</a> on the 50th line in the ranking (11.1 Mbit / s on average). <br><br>  The government <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/millystilinovic/2017/02/14/how-australias-ridiculously-slow-internet-speeds-are-harming-its-residents/">had plans</a> to create an expensive high-speed network, but this would increase the cost of communication for subscribers.  People reacted ambiguously to such plans, and experts said that there would be no demand for such a service.  Therefore, probably, on this continent the situation with the “slow Internet” will not change. <br><br>  Materials on the topic from the corporate blog VAS Experts: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/seti/kak-postroena-set-internet-provajdera/">How to build an ISP network</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/qos/sposoby-effektivnogo-raspredeleniya-polosy-propuskaniya/">How to efficiently allocate bandwidth</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/kogda-zakonchatsya-adresa-ipv4-ipv4-i-nat/">Life without IPv4: Solving a Problem with NAT</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://vasexperts.ru/blog/opoveshhenie-naseleniya-o-chs-novaya-obyazannost-internet-provajdera/">The internet provider has new responsibilities: notifying the public about an emergency</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344124/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344124/</a></p>
