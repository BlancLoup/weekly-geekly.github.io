And some technical articles disappear (in drafts).  For observant readers of Habr, it is no secret that a UFO is trying to somehow remedy this situation by inviting authors of technical articles from the Sandbox, but there is no particular effect from this - having written a couple of articles such an author usually goes to commentators (well, if you don‚Äôt grab your articles in drafts). <br>  This is a small article-reasoning.  I just share my thoughts, without any claims to absolute truth.  Perhaps there are like-minded people, or critics of such thinking.  Those who are not interested - just pass by ... <br>  The ‚Äúdemand‚Äù for such articles is small. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Why are there so few technical articles, despite UFO efforts to attract authors? </h5><br>  It is clear that advertising posts, reviews of software and equipment are needed and one cannot get away from them.  Such articles are interesting to read to the majority, they attract the audience, bring money and fame and maybe something else, but for writing such articles usually requires a minimum of technical knowledge and a maximum of writing skills.  To write such an article in most cases you do not need to have some kind of profound professional skills. <br><br>  Technically, any enikey, junior programmer or novice electronics engineer (who learned to blink a LED on Arduin yesterday) could write such an article (if there is a certain writing talent). <br><br>  It's great, such articles are interesting, but take a look at the flip side of the coin.

      General technical articles are interesting to the majority - the authors earn their karma and rating, get some power in the community.  But what is the majority of these authors?  Enikey, junior programmers, novice electronics engineers?  They are, by definition, an order of magnitude more than the more qualified specialists who are able to share really interesting highly specialized knowledge! <br><br>  And what happens to the experts?  Yes, they also write articles (there are very interesting materials on Habr√© and periodically new ones appear), but the majority with low qualifications simply cannot assess them, sometimes even this misunderstanding of the essence of the article leads to its rejection and karma and author‚Äôs rating, in principle A good feature article, merge.  Often, as soon as the rating of the article begins to go into the minus - it is transferred to drafts and never ‚Äúcomes out‚Äù again. <br><br>  Naturally, the author goes to the "commentators", about any desire to share knowledge with the community resource no longer occurs (well, maybe another attempt to "recover").  Some then ‚Äúimbued with the spirit of Habr‚Äù and stop writing technical articles - they write what the audience perceives.  Naturally, in such a situation there can be no talk of any influx of competent authors and the development of specialized hubs. <br><br><h5>  What's next? </h5><br>  Further Habr can remain a popular science resource.  Or maybe a UFO will come up with how to protect highly specialized articles in thematic hubs and give specialists the opportunity to develop these hubs, to arrange self-regulation not in the entire community, but in each of its branches.  But quite possibly a UFO is not needed ... <br><br>  DIXI <br><br>  PS <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/gameboyhippo/" class="user_link">gameboyhippo</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/andorro/" class="user_link">andorro</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/fiesta/" class="user_link">Fiesta</a> , and others, remaining anonymous - thanks.  You just confirmed the accuracy of the observations described in this article.  And the statistics of voting for the article seems to hint that your point of view is not the only one <s>(although it is in the majority)</s> (and not in the majority anymore). <br><br>  <b>UPD.1</b> I do not propose to make a revolution / cancel karma / cancel voting.  I only point out that the existing mechanisms of community self-regulation do not allow it to develop in some directions.  In any case, the conclusions do not those who comment here, or quietly anonymously minus the article, or even completely merges my karma (If I had been concerned with karma on Habr√©, this post would not have appeared). <br>  And I do not see anything wrong with the "scientific popularity". <br><br>  <b>UPD.2</b> I thought about the request of the author of "popular" articles @acosta <br><blockquote>  Show an example of an article whose author was scored in the comments and zaminusovali </blockquote><br>  and decided that pointing a finger at someone would be incorrect.  Perhaps someone from ‚ÄúOkhabrennyh‚Äù who still visits the site to comment independently will appear in the comments? <br><br>  <b>UPD.3</b> As the discussion and voting show, the problem is urgent.  We are waiting for the arrival of a UFO ... <br><br>  <b>UPD.4</b> The comments sounded a lot of suggestions for improvement, but most of them offer simple measures (something to eliminate, somewhere to change the weight).  I dare to suggest that simple measures are indispensable - a more subtle adjustment of the self-regulation mechanism is required. <br>  One thing is clear for sure - the problem takes place, otherwise this post (and its neighbor) would be at once stalled and the minds of Habrovchan would not be disturbed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/233895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/233895/</a></p>
