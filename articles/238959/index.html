  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Restarting the Golden Site - the oldest competition of Internet projects Runet</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr!  Probably all the representatives of studios and agencies who have been working in the market for at least a few years, have heard about the <a href="http://2014.goldensite.ru/">Golden Site</a> .  This is the first Russian competition of Internet projects, launched as early as 1997.  At various times, the jury was headed by Tema Lebedev, Exler, Anton Nosik and other famous people in RuNet.  When I was still working on the side of the agency (in the ADV in the region of 2006-2009), we regularly submitted whole packs of work and received (and sometimes did not receive) the cherished statuettes of the golden cybermaster.  I remember that even then I really wanted to somehow participate in the organization of this whole movement. <br><br>  In recent years, the activity on the Golden Site has slightly decreased, and we decided to help with the revival of the oldest competitive brand.  In the spring of this year, we held several meetings with the project founder Mikhail Vakhterov - and agreed to help with the development of the competition in the status of co-organizers (together with RAEC). <br><br>  Here I must say that despite the abundance of all sorts of awards and festivals in the market, there are almost no mass site contests.  There are big advertising festivals in which there are nominations for digital (such as MIAF, ADCR, KMRF, etc.), there are foreign projects that regularly give out prizes such as FWA and Awwwards, which choose the sites of the day / week, etc. But projects with a large number of nominations, where each studio / agency (or site owner) can find a suitable nomination for any of their top jobs - almost none (there is a wonderful Runet Rating of our colleagues, but this is not enough).

      In general, we decided to revive the Golden Site - and did it.  We carried out an easy rebranding, <a href="http://2014.goldensite.ru/">developed a new website for the competition</a> , new statuettes, new nominations, planned a big award ceremony.  And now we open the reception of applications and look forward to new good work. <br><br> <a href="http://2014.goldensite.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c02/700/b80/c02700b80c21254a7ea2d9eaaef40fa7.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  One of the pieces of the Golden Site is an independent jury.  This year Sergey Kotyrev from UMI became its chairman.  And to increase the transparency of the process of distributing elephants, we plan to open all evaluation sheets of all jury members - so that there are no questions or doubts. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We accept work in more than 50 categories - there is where to roam.  In two separate blocks, more complex digital projects (media mix, viral, mobile stories, etc.) and own studios / agencies sites are made. <br><br>  There is not much time left to submit entries, we accept them until October 24th.  And the Award Ceremony will be held in one of the Moscow clubs in the evening on November 13 - after the second day of the RIW-14 conference. <br><br>  Stages of the passage of the Golden Site: <br><br><ol><li>  Reception of entries - until October 24 </li><li>  Online voting and the formation of shortlists - November 7 </li><li>  Award Ceremony - November 13 </li></ol><br>  We invite everyone who is somehow connected with the design and web development to take part in the Gold Site and test the strength of their best work in a fair fight with colleagues.  It will be fun =) All the details - on the new site <a href="http://2014.goldensite.ru/">2014.goldensite.ru</a> . <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/238959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/238959/</a></p>
