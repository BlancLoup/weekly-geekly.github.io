      <br>
      I haven‚Äôt been posting articles for a thousand years, probably everyone has already forgotten about us). <br><br><h4>  Our way </h4><br>  Not so long ago, for me it was generally as if yesterday, at the beginning of September, we were sitting three together: I, Diana - now the head of the distribution department and Igor - now the head of the financial department, noted 10,000 rubles of revenue per day. <br><br>  Then, just a month after the launch of our project, we were extremely happy that we could not only recoup the operating expenses, but also make a profit.  At that moment we decided that the next monetary target for us is 100,000 rubles of revenue per day. <br><br>  I will try now to reveal the retrospective history of our development from the moment of its launch in August to the present day. <br><br><h4>  June 25, 2015 - the decision to start developing CallbackKILLER </h4><br>  In fact, CallbackKILLER was originally conceived as an automatic dialer from the forms that already exist on the site, only in the middle of July we decided to make a button and a widget. <br><br>  It all started with a question to my subscribers in the VKontakte group, how much they need such a service). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/07d/6d2/4d6/07d6d24d6cca488780157cc9637cab17.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  According to the answers, it became clear that it is needed.  And we quickly set about implementing.  More precisely, Igor started the implementation as a developer and architect of the service. <br><br>  Very little time passed and we decided to add the functionality of the service with the button and the widget window.  That was in July 2015. <br><br>  Completely ready for the start, we came to July 27.  All guns are charged and ... The first decision on the advancement was the use of cold ringing, which we used for a long time and our favorite tool.  Pricing policy was chosen 50 rubles per lead.  Target audience travel agencies.  We called for a week and we managed to attract one client - the travel agency Amazon, which is still with us <a href="http://amazontravel.ru/">http://amazontravel.ru/</a> . <br><br>  And from the same client, we received the first money, in the Excel file according to statistics for the month of July, we received only 900 rubles. <br><br>  At this stage of the launch can be considered complete. <br><br><h4>  Model change and restart - August 3, 2015 </h4><br>  We sold the service from the week of July 27 to July 31, and by the end of the week we sat on our heads.  That will not do, 900 rubles a week, it‚Äôs as much as 3,600 rubles a month) <br><br>  We took a hookah, got more coffee and various snacks and closed the three of us in the office to think.  We came to the fact that the model of work on the leads or by the minutes is not relevant and everyone exploits it in the tail and in the mane, we decided to invent and launch our model on the market.  Minute 4 rubles and there are two versions Paid and Free.  The paid version allows you to use advanced functionality for only 750 rubles per month.  All weekend we reworked the office, letters and site. <br><br>  And this strategy has brought results.  We started on August 3 and received 500 registrations within 24 hours.  We thought we were on the right track and continued to work hard. <br><br><h4>  August 2015 </h4><br>  According to the results for August 2015, we obtained 1,848 registrations and 97,368 rubles of payments.  We are very pleased with it.  We began to constantly receive feedback from users, now it is all open on social networks <a href="http://cbkiller.ru/reviews/">http://cbkiller.ru/reviews/</a> . <br><br>  Just at that moment in time, it became clear to us that we must work very closely on customer service and the quality of the product itself, so that we could develop actively without investments. <br><br>  The main discovery of August was - the product is the main thing (the product is not only the software itself, but also the service and financial service and every detail when interacting with the client). <br><br><h4>  September 2015 </h4><br>  In September we received 1,892 registrations and revenues of 300,814 rubles. <br><br>  In September, we began to talk at every step about the success of our model and our dear competitors did not fail to take advantage of this and copy the model and texts from the site).  It was very cool for us and served as a good kick for further progress.  Guys - thank you very much. <br><br>  Of course, we decided to make an event out of this with copying the info guide and write articles <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f7/eac/235/7f7eac2351cf45d3a326b5d8ef2be280.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  September gave us another discovery.  We made a huge mistake - we added a definition of VKontakte profiles to the service, but again the non-dormant competitors handed us over to all instances that were only possible and started calling our customers, but the beard didn‚Äôt pass, and on the contrary loyalty only increased!  The second time, thanks friends)! <br><br>  The main conclusion of September is: before doing any functionality, make sure everything is legal.  And second, all that is not done, all for the better. <br><br><h4>  October 2015 </h4><br>  Received 1,810 registrations and 577,551 rubles of revenue. <br><br>  In October, we finally arrived at what is now.  We decided that we didn‚Äôt want to just call back, but we wanted to be a ‚Äúsuitcase of internet marketer‚Äù in which the marketer could find any tools for internet marketing in one personal account. <br><br>  This strategy is chosen and used by us as a guide to this day. <br><br>  Also in October we decided to launch White Label. The direction of our service.  We decided that each partner can choose how to work with us: <br><br>  1. Under our brand; <br><br>  2. Under its own brand with its prices and its design. <br><br>  And all this in the cloud.  we decided to do it all as a separate project: <a href="http://whitesaas.com/">whitesaas.com</a> <br><br>  Here are examples of those who started on the basis of it: <br><br>  <a href="http://welcome.callbackhelper.com/">http://welcome.callbackhelper.com/</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://7calls.ru/">http://7calls.ru</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://illcallback.ru/">http://illcallback.ru/</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://bicall.ru/">http://bicall.ru</a> <br><br>  <a href="http://call.itraffic.su/">http://call.itraffic.su/</a> <br><br>  Conclusion of October: partnering, partnering and partnering. <br><br>  The next period I will not paint monthly, the relevance of the data is high until I reveal the figures in half a year, but for now I‚Äôll tell you what is happening at the moment. <br><br><h4>  February 2015 </h4><br>  The day before yesterday reached the turnover of 100,000 rubles a day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b1e/db6/2b3/b1edb62b3e724bb6be08aca7c9445ba3.jpg"><br><br>  Raised the team to 15 people <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/142/fd5/ec3/142fd5ec3afd4103bac3f14e3b15d170.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c34/8e5/809/c348e5809d2241f587d5e23d5f47f1ba.jpg"><br><br>  Made new modules: <br><br><ul><li>  Customer Generator - <a href="http://cb-killer.ru/generator">http://cb-killer.ru/generator</a> </li><li>  Free module Invader - <a href="http://cb-killer.ru/invader">http://cb-killer.ru/invader</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298614/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298614/</a></p>
