  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Circle "crazy hands": 4 life hacking about how to rationally fill the server with disks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This post will begin with a well-known parable: <br><br><blockquote> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/squadra-group/blog/279877/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/003/e44/da8/003e44da8a95451893ae783f874a0ad4.jpeg" align="left"></a>  Professor of Philosophy, standing in front of his audience, took a five-liter glass jar and filled it with stones, each not less than three centimeters in diameter.  At the end asked the students if the bank is full?  The students replied that yes, it is full. <br>  Then he opened a can of peas and poured its contents into a large can, shook it a little.  Peas took a free space between the stones.  Once again the professor asked the students, is the bank full?  Answered: yes, full. <br>  Then he took a box filled with sand and poured it into the jar.  Naturally, the sand took up a completely existing free space and closed everything.  Once again the professor asked the students, is the bank full?  They answered: yes, and this time definitely, it is full. <br>  Then, from under the table, he took out a mug of water and poured it into the jar to the last drop, soaking the sand.  The students laughed. <br>  - And now I want you to understand that the bank is your life ... </blockquote><br>  Of course, this parable was not about servers, but in general, the principle should be clear :) We are all inventors at heart, and this feature is clearly manifested in us when we have to perform tasks, having at hand limited resources and tools .  In difficult economic conditions, when budgets are severely curtailed, and projects hang in the air due to lack of computing power, second-hand servers come to the rescue. <br><br>  Often, however, even these measures are not enough, and customers are looking for further options for savings.  One such option is the efficient use of server hard drives.  Despite the fact that sometimes we have to use all our ingenuity and ingenuity, we always strive to meet the needs of our customers.  Therefore, today we want to share with you some life hacks on how to make the most efficient use of disk space in used servers for a small amount of money. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#016f81">Life hacking number 1.</font>  <font color="#016f81">There are no many drives</font> </h2><br>  We equip single-server server not with 4 disks, as it is provided by the design, but with 6 disks.  To do this, we will need a Supermicro 6016T-UF server, 4 3.5-inch disks, 2 SSD disks, double-sided tape (tape is our all!) And a small piece of foam rubber or similar material.

      Actions: <br><br><ol><li>  Sticking tape over the niche for the drive and on the bottom side we glue the foam rubber as a ‚Äúseal‚Äù. </li><li>  Put the SSD in this niche </li><li>  We connect to the motherboard </li><li>  We perform the same operation with the second disk. </li><li>  Insert the remaining 4 3.5 "disks </li></ol><br>  All free space in the 1U server works for you. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01a/16c/06d/01a16c06d1193a777480b6ab69c82989.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac0/82d/221/ac082d221a0f7ba8bf00155d191918d8.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#016f81">Life hacking number 2.</font>  <font color="#016f81">Another way to increase the number of disks</font> </h2><br>  As it turned out, the theme of server hard drives is relevant and burning for many clients.  They aggressively test the capabilities of the servers and constantly check their maximum capacity.  Not spared this fate and our "pensioner¬ª HP DL360 G5.  Unlike the previous case, we add 2 additional trays for disks to this server.  In addition to the trays, we put the SmartArray P400i controller in the server.  Due to these actions, you can slightly expand the capabilities of the server.  By the way, with this design, 2 pci-e connectors remain free, which allows you to go crazy further. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b33/4a1/183/b334a1183d8bce6fe450362dd9c4ab17.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d7/890/62d/1d789062d495f014d8a966dd55d3d32a.png"><br><br><h2>  <font color="#016f81">Life hacking number 3.</font>  <font color="#016f81">Trust but check</font> </h2><br>  Often, customers ask the same question - whether 3.5 "6TB hard drives will work correctly on our servers in 2009. Everyone is confused by the documentation posted on the manufacturer's website supermicro.com. We decided to test disks of this size. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/18b/23d/76a/18b23d76ab4ea75c653b45dd5d415152.png"><br><br>  We found out that 6 TB drives work just as well as 1 TB drives.  There is no difference.  The documentation for the motherboard was compiled in 2009, at that time there were no disks with such volume on the market, for this reason this information is not available on the manufacturer's website. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#016f81">Life hacking number 4.</font>  <font color="#016f81">Cheap and angry</font> </h2><br>  How to find the use of small 2.5 "disks in a used server? We have found the simplest adapters ASUS HDD Bracket ASY CONVERT 2.5 on the market that allow to realize this idea. Issue price 800 rub. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/daa/ae3/263/daaae326317235eb5382b6cc7784c7ca.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d89/56b/84e/d8956b84ef545df45cb8a410908bf4cf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e34/586/a09/e34586a093814bf4cd40ae023b6038e4.jpg"><br><br>  In our opinion, this is a simple and budget solution to the problem. <br><br>  We are well aware that it‚Äôs not a good life that has to be lame so in this way, but you can always find a way out.  If this situation is familiar to you, then share your life hacking in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279877/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279877/</a></p>
