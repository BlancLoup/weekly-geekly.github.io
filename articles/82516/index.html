I want to share not an article, but an idea that visited me on this magnificent Friday morning after reading this wonderful article. <br><br>  <strong>The essence of the idea.</strong> <br><br>  Implement direct mail in web studios / advertising agencies that deal with the Internet.  In principle, the idea can be transferred to other areas ... But back to the idea.  The introduction of direct mail itself is not as interesting as the fact that we will not send out postcards and price lists, but small brochures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>A bit of analogy.</strong>

      My soulmate regularly receives such a thing from some online clothing store.  There are published new and relevant seasonal products.  The biggest beauty is that this brochure is stored, not somewhere far away, but next to her laptop, constantly displaying the large logo of its brand on the cover.  Frankly speaking, I‚Äôm never interested in this, but it has so much in my eyes that I recognize the logo of this brand on banners on the Web.  And when someone asks whether it is possible to order clothes somewhere in the network, I definitely answer that there and there. <br><br>  <strong>Let's return to web studios and advertising agencies.</strong> <br><br>  Distributing such a brochure among your customers should increase your loyalty and awareness of your company.  Also partners of clients in the office may notice a brochure, etc. <br>  Whatever your direct mail address seems like regular spam, I suggest writing the following: <br><ul><li>  General news of the Internet, but not about social networks and that Google will develop its OS.  It is better to write about the fact that they measure the audience of UAnet.  The fact that the prices of display advertising are falling or rising.  The fact that the online advertising market has grown, because because.  Roughly speaking, write about what will be really interesting and useful (!) To your customers.  If Yandex has launched something with its cards and your studio can implement it on the client‚Äôs website, then write about it! </li><li>  Be sure to write some analytical and instructive articles.  For example, to become about how to analyze search traffic, or how to evaluate an advertising campaign by type of CPC or something like that. </li><li>  It is also worth mentioning your achievements during this time.  Surely you have developed a site of some interesting / well-known company or just an interesting project.  Maybe you have introduced some innovations in your company, which reduces the cost of work or time of work, and maybe improves the quality.  If your prices have changed - write about it, justify it.  Your customers are not only customers, but also partners in some way.  You came up with some kind of action on the New Year and write about it. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Subtleties.</strong> <br><br>  The size of this brochure may be different.  I guess it will be on four A4 sheets: a cover of 2 pages and 6 pages inside.  You can print on thin paper of poor quality.  Although this is a personal matter of everyone's profitability. <br>  The frequency of release is again different.  In my opinion, it is reasonable to do it once a quarter.  I attribute this to the fact that the duration of one project to create a site on average is about two months and a quarter seems to me to be quite a suitable period for such a direct-mile. <br><br>  <strong>Important.</strong> <br><br>  Be sure to keep in mind that with such brochures you increase the general knowledge of your customers and push them to new orders.  The important thing is that your studio could do this work.  Before publication, it is better that the team read all this and approve. <br>  <a href="http://gudkovsa.net/2010/01/direct-mail-v-veb-studiyah/"><i>Original in my blog</i></a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82516/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82516/</a></p>
