  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The Russian national payment system has all chances to be more successful than the existing ones.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, the question of building a national payment system in Russia has become acute. <br><br>  To build a global competitor VISA / MC Russia, most likely, will not succeed.  Instead, you can not build a clearing company - a copy of VISA / MC, which at some point may even turn into a pseudo-banking structure, but build an infrastructure in which each bank will perform the functions of such a clearing company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now the Government and the State Duma proceed from the erroneous view that banks have lagged behind progress and to solve this problem it is required to create a superbank structure of the type of international VISA / MC systems.  Agree with this is impossible.  Earlier in the <a href="http://juryev.ru/publikacii/grazhdanskoe-pravo/437-sozdanie-platezhnoy-sistemy">article,</a> we already noted that Russia, due to the later ‚Äúentry‚Äù into technologies, has the advantage of cheapness of these technologies and the possibility of ‚Äúentering‚Äù them at a higher level without the ‚Äúbrakes‚Äù that keep those who ‚Äúentered‚Äù in them before.  There are many examples of this, one can say, so to speak, a household analogy: databases that have been spent on developing millions of dollars in due time, which should ‚Äúpay off‚Äù, are now available under free open licenses to any webmaster. <br><br>  On a new technological basis, relations between banks are such that no additional bank structure is simply needed.

      At present, our company is accompanying a major deal to sell one federal company in favor of another.  We will not indicate the market, since there are only a few players in this market, and it will be immediately clear what company is being discussed, and our relationship with the client does not involve disclosing information about our participation without his consent.  But what we are facing now.  The deal - in addition to any due diligence and other intricacies, is reduced to a simple contract of sale of shares in the managing company.  As is known, the ownership of a share is transferred at the time of notarization of the transaction on alienation (clause 12 of Article 21 of the Federal Law "On Limited Liability Companies").  Initially, we discussed with representatives of investors the possibility of settlements through a letter of credit.  But having considered the real situation, we came to the conclusion that it is possible to do without any letters of credit. <br><br>  The scheme is as follows.  The parties meet at the notary (more precisely, the notary himself arrives at the office, for half a million rubles ‚Äúcharged at the rate‚Äù you can go for a ride).  We make all the documents, print, contracts signed by the buyer.  At the same time, the person authorized to sign the payment order sends the payment through the bank-client.  A few minutes later, the seller calls his bank and ascertains whether the funds were received on the correspondent account of his bank.  After that, the seller signs the contract, and the notary certifies it. <br><br>  There is nothing unreal in this scheme.  Of course, in our conditions, in order for everything to happen that way, it is necessary for the buyer to agree on the eve with the operator or with the manager in his bank, to wait for him to pay and process it immediately.  The seller will have to negotiate with the bank operator in his bank the same day so that they can quickly check the balances on the correspondent account of the bank.  But when it comes to such large amounts, it is not so difficult. <br><br>  What is the result?  Payment is literally online, the delay is calculated in minutes and is due solely to the human factor.  From human participation in the processing of payments to get rid of, at least, to a certain limit, which can be defined as the upper amount of allowable payments.  Actually, in the banks it is happening now, which is easily seen by sending a large amount to the account of the physical person and a small amount to the account of some supplier. <br>  On the example of this transaction, places of delay on the payment path are clearly visible.  The first thing we have is the formation of a payment document (we will not be limited to a payment order).  Obviously, in cases with ‚Äúcard‚Äù payments, the payment document must be made by the seller.  In the usual case, this would be a payment request (as all power sales companies used to work), but if we approach this document from this perspective, then the payment request will require three steps: <br><br><blockquote>  setting a payment request by the seller - acceptance by the payer - sending by the payer bank with sending a message to the seller. </blockquote><br><br>  Meanwhile, if we consider the same document as a payer order, then we shorten the procedure to two steps: <br><blockquote>  Sending a payment order signed by the payer - sending by the payer bank and sending a message to the seller. </blockquote><br><br>  In the conditions of electronic data interchange, saving is important at every step. <br><br>  So, the payment order, in the preparation and filling of which the seller ‚Äúhelps‚Äù.  There is nothing illegal in this, since the payer still ‚Äúsigns‚Äù this document. <br><br>  Next comes the identification of the payer, for which there are various kinds of electronic data stored on some physical medium.  In the situation with the calculations that our clients have to make, this is a flash drive to the bank-client plus a PIN code, in the case of settlement ‚Äúin the street‚Äù, this is a bank card plus password, however, one cannot say that the options are exhausted. identification options are now very much. <br><br>  After identification through the client bank, the operations officer should see the received signed payment order from the payer and send it from the correspondent account of his bank (which is open to each bank in the Central Bank of the Russian Federation) to the correspondent account of the receiving bank. <br><br>  Everything, the payment is ‚Äúgone‚Äù and the receiving bank can already ‚Äúsee‚Äù it in its correspondent account. <br><br>  Then begins the same story in the receiving bank.  The operator has to see this payment and credit the money either to the beneficiary‚Äôs account or, if there is no such bank, to a special account ‚Äúuntil clarification‚Äù. <br><br>  Although the methods of identification of bank customers are still in operation, nothing prevents them from making them universal.  The 20-digit number of the current account allows one to uniquely identify any customer‚Äôs current account.  In the end, if the numbers will be missed, it will be possible to add, since it will still be less than now.  Recall that in the payment order that we send to the bank now there are the following figures: TIN, KPP, current account, correspondent account, BIC, number of priority.  Plus, the name of the party and its bank.  Naturally, this should be multiplied by two, since the payment is always two sides.  Plus to this - the amount and the basis of payment.  The numbers, as you can see, are sufficiently abundant, therefore a single universal identifier of the settlement account - in exchange for the TIN, KPP, correspondent account, BIC, the name of the party and its bank - would reduce the payment order to three numbers: the number of the payer and the recipient, the amount of payment and two necessary data: the basis of payment and the signature of the payer. <br>  Such a scheme of work does not violate the right of depositors to ensure their banking secrecy, since the data on the account content is still stored only in the bank itself, so you can even go to the next step: to make the data on the current universal identifier of the settlement account available online.  This will allow the payer bank to automatically verify the existence of the payee and exclude erroneous payments, for which a separate account 47416 is currently used. <br>  Introduction of a universal account identifier will allow you to automatically send and distribute payments in the bank. <br><br>  A calculation system built on a new basis should look like this: <br><blockquote>  entering a payment order, signing it - approval by the payer bank with sending a notification to the recipient. </blockquote><br><br>  Obviously, no superbank structure is absolutely necessary here. <br><br>  You can add confirmation from the beneficiary bank in this chain, but this is an additional link, it seems that at the CBR level the issue can be resolved so that the payer bank could not send a notification to the recipient until the payment was sent, this can be easily solved by software.  However, the confirmation of the beneficiary's bank is also not particularly difficult. <br><br>  There remains only one question: what will be the amount of payments, in which there will be no participation of a teller?  The bar can be set different, and the risk of erroneous payments - to insure.  Perhaps it will be 100000-200000 rubles, as now, it may be a different amount.  In the end, the risk of error persists with the "manual" processing of payments. <br><br>  If the payment system is built on such a basis, payments can be made with the same ease as cash payments, and even more convenient - for example, when making payments for real estate, the parties have to go through a long procedure for checking bills, which cost in different banks in the region 1 ruble for each bill.  Recalculation of money is also a separate service in banks working with cash. <br><br>  What can the Central Bank do in order to implement such a calculation scheme? <br><br>  In fact, everything is almost ready at the interbank level, it remains only to deal with the processes occurring within banks.  I must admit that everything here is very neglected.  Who faced the bank-clients of our banks, knows this firsthand.  Online customers are usually no better, especially given the pathological commitment of banking programmers to Internet Explorer, and with rather old versions. <br><br>  In this situation, the Central Bank must oblige everyone to introduce a single standard for identifying and making payments within banks, which excludes tellers from this process.  This in itself is not difficult, since in many respects the procedures are already formalized and, of course, no actual ‚Äúmanual‚Äù payment processing is performed.  Perhaps the intrabank program should be unified or it can be developed by the bank itself, but in accordance with the requirements of the Central Bank (for example, payment processing is no longer than 5 Œºs on an average processor, format). <br><br>  More difficult is the issue of user and reader identification.  However, the groundwork in this area is complete, it is only necessary to determine the option and the strong-willed decision to oblige everyone to use it.  You need to choose the option based on its safety, cost, reliability, non-volatility and other requirements - all this may affect the optimality, but in general there is now a lot to choose from, and there are enough specialists.  It is not excluded that the construction of a new system is possible on the basis of existing equipment. <br><br>  Of course, the described settlement system has problems in terms of settlements with banks that are not part of the Russian banking system.  This problem is mitigated by the fact that many foreign banks have representative offices in Russia, and our banks have correspondent accounts in foreign banks.  But in general, the problem remains, but it can also be solved - either at the intergovernmental level, or at the level of interbank agreements.  The scheme we offer is beneficial for banks and beneficial for consumers.  Banks are exempt from monopolists in the form of international payment systems, and consumers do not pay those 3-3.5% who take these payment systems for their services. <br><br>  Summing up, it can be noted that the construction of a new settlement system should be carried out not on the basis of outdated and expensive solutions, like VISA / MC, but on the basis of more promising and less costly methods, moreover oriented to the really existing banking system of Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218499/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218499/</a></p>
