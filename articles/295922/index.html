  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How we created startup SaaS Credit</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <b>From order to startup</b> <br><br>  Hello, dear readers.  Today I want to tell you how my team and I created a service for MFIs.  First I want to introduce myself - my name is Bulat, I live and work in the city of Astrakhan.  I recently received a Startup subscription from Megamind, which is a huge thanks to the resource.  I am the owner and director of the company <a href="https://doslab.ru/">DosLab</a> .  We develop software and IT services for businesses.  Periodically, our team creates IT startups, investing in them the money earned, as well as attracting interested investors. <br><br>  The main development strategy of our company is the development of custom-made software, but if the project has real potential for other companies, we work at cost and, under an agreement with the customer, reserve the exclusive rights to the developed product.  Thus, we get: an objective assessment of customer needs, a demonstration platform and a strategy for further sales based on customer values, and the customer, in turn, is a working solution for his business.  I try not to live for one day, because why overestimate the cost and earn once a million, if it is possible in partnership with the customer to earn a billion.  One of these products, the most technically advanced, in my opinion, was the <a href="https://saascredit.ru/">SaaS Credit</a> service.  I would like to tell how it was created.

In order not to be distracted from research in vain, I combined my order for cloud automation of MFIs with my research work.  This gave a significant plus in defending a thesis, since  I already had practically confirmed indicators and evidence of my theory.  As part of the thesis, an electronic document management system for a microfinance organization in Astrakhan was developed and implemented, taking into account the territorial distribution of the organization.  This system is now successfully used by this MFI. <br><br>  Through research, I learned a lot about the microcredit business.  The main discovery was the fact that, despite the huge number of IFIs operating in Russia today, there are practically no specialized <b>integrated</b> IT solutions on the domestic market oriented specifically to microcredit.  Therefore, today MFIs are forced to try to adapt 1C and other software systems for themselves.  At the same time, the manufacturers of such software solutions often do not take into account the specifics of business processes and algorithms of each MFI, the products are not quite flexible.  The client is often imposed unnecessary functionality and, as a consequence, the complexity of the user functionality, such systems are deployed from 1 to 3 months, taking into account the already ready base.  The negative effect is also reflected in the fact that now software development is most often an engineering work on a pattern, it practically lacks a scientific approach, a new methodology that takes into account business interests.  For science, this is also not very good, it remains more theoretical without practical tests. <br><br>  Realizing this, I realized that, using my knowledge and professional skills, me and my guys will be able to create a truly relevant specialized solution that will be really in demand in the market. <br><br>  <b>Creating a service</b> <br><br>  Of course, I did not develop the service alone.  The whole team of talented DosLab specialists joined the work.  We took my dissertation work as a basis.  However, in the future the project was developed and more and more modified.  We sought to create a cloud solution that would not only allow to automate the work of existing MFIs, but also actually allow us to create a ready-made operating business - this is the main concept of the solution in the broad sense of the word. <br><br>  As a result of our work, the SaaS Credit service was created, in which it is already difficult to recognize the electronic document management system, which served as the starting point for its development.  Rather, the service is already an IT ecosystem for MFIs.  The development approach itself was fundamentally changed, now the system architecture itself is completely object-oriented, which makes it possible to obtain a huge potential for scalability.  Now we are testing the Marketplace subsystem, which will help attract free developers to create separate modules and share with us earnings.  Thus, the software package will become even more powerful with minimal costs and minimal burden on our company.  Of course, all modules will be thoroughly moderated by our specialists. <br><br>  SaaS Credit is a comprehensive solution for the automation of microfinance organizations working on a cloud server.  The product is implemented on the basis of cross-platform technologies.  Due to this, our service can be used by almost any MFI, regardless of its IT infrastructure and operating systems used.  We also provided for the possibility of using the service for any principle of microcredit organization.  This can be, as the issuance of cash loans for cash orders, and online lending with crediting to bank cards. <br>  We have built our service on a modular basis.  Now it has more than 15 modules, which allows you to choose the optimal configuration for any MFI and easily integrate with any third-party products, including scoring systems, credit bureaus, 1C, client-banks, etc.  The modular structure also allows you to select the optimal tariff plan.  The complex provides automation of all specialists, including cashier, operator, underwriter, collector.  Built-in scoring system, effectively eliminates potentially problematic borrowers. <br><br>  The introduction of SaaS Credit provides ample opportunities for a world-financial organization.  This is a significant savings, since effective integrated business automation is provided without expensive equipment, IT infrastructure and without an IT department. <br><br>  The main achievement can be considered that SaaS Credit is a complete solution for creating a microcredit business in real time.  At the same time, the service not only allows automating business, but also helps at the start.  The built-in lead generation system automatically directs the flow of ‚Äúhot‚Äù clients to the business.  A powerful scoring system integrated with large credit bureaus provides efficient screening of unreliable borrowers.  This significantly reduces credit risks, which is especially valuable at the initial stage.  In addition, rejected applications can be sold on the lead exchange, providing additional income. <br><br>  Our service can significantly improve the performance of the existing microfinance organization and ensure the success of newly created MFIs.  In this case, I believe that the process of creating SaaS Credit has not yet been completed.  We regularly update our service, not only offering new functions and adding new modules, but also introducing new algorithms and methodologies.  Work on improving the service is carried out, including, and taking into account the wishes of existing customers, as well as in parallel works of scientific research.  Now the main part of the work is aimed precisely at assessing risks and preventing losses in the aggregate not only of automation, but also the competence and productivity of employees.  We study various standards and scientific papers in the field of risk models and create new ones, which will also be published in scientific journals.  In terms of technology, we are now working with partners in the field of Big Data.  This will allow in advance to reduce the risks of losses and defaults, and as a result, the thoughtless receipt of loans by our citizens.  Therefore, we are confident that over time our product will become even better and bring more profit to our customers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295922/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295922/</a></p>
