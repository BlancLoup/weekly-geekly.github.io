      We live in an ecosystem that is subject to constant change.  New technologies appear daily.  Customers set themselves new business challenges, striving to achieve the best performance indicators for their projects.  Such changes in technology and customer expectations mean that our professional skills must constantly evolve, otherwise we simply will not be able to meet customer expectations and ensure successful development for our own companies. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  One huge advantage plays for us: it is very easy to experiment in web space.  Create new web pages or new business models, try new marketing strategies.  If we have some idea, we can quickly implement it, then collect statistical data, on the basis of which we can quickly decide on its effectiveness.  We learn and develop our business. <br><br>  The best companies in the world are not afraid of change, they learn how to quickly make and understand their mistakes.  Thanks to this and become great. <br><br>  <b>What do you think is more effective for a company that wants to optimize conversion on the site side: order professional specialized usability testing with focus groups and expert opinion, or engage professional web analytics, who, after analyzing data from web analytics systems, will reveal weaknesses Online?</b>  <b>Are these methods interchangeable or should they complement each other?</b> <br><br>  Both methods are good and each in its own way. <br><br>  In my book <a href="http://goo.gl/qI5fm">‚ÄúWeb Analytics 2.0,‚Äù</a> I write that, in conducting the analysis, we must study both ‚ÄúWhat are they doing?‚Äù (Analysis of statistical data on visitors' actions on the site) and ‚ÄúWhy do they do it?‚Äù (Polls, usability testing, etc.).  The first helps to determine the priority areas of analysis, and the second - to hear the voice of the consumer. <br><br>  At the same time, I want web analysis specialists to try to think outside of traditional usability testing and small focus groups.  These methods are good for identifying big problems, while on the Internet you can find great tools that allow usability testing online (at an affordable cost, quickly and regularly).  They allow you to significantly expand coverage and get the views of a much larger number of your clients. <br><br>  Not so long ago, in my blog, I already gave examples of such tools: <a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/best-web-analytics-tools-quantitative-qualitative/">www.kaushik.net/avinash/best-web-analytics-tools-quantitative-qualitative</a> <br><br>  <b>What do you think is more effective for a company: have an analyst on staff or hire a contractor?</b> <br><br>  A serious approach to analyzing the effectiveness of achieving targets is one of the most valuable gifts a company can make to itself.  I am very happy to hear that companies in Russia are beginning to think about how best to invest in web analytics specialists. <br><br>  If you directly answer the question, it all depends on what stage of development the company is at. <br><br>  If the company is just starting and it does not have a clear understanding of the methods for evaluating the effectiveness of its actions, then I would strongly recommend contacting third-party specialists.  Attract them early and they will help you in a short time.  Let me do it in three months what you could do for a whole year.  Invest funds in them, demand that they train you and carry out a real analysis, and not provide only cumbersome reports with dry numbers. <br><br>  Taking the first steps and at the same time enhancing your own experience, you should gradually transfer part of the tasks from the contract to the company's employees.  You can start, for example, with tactical planning. <br><br>  Over time, you will still need advice.  But now it will be tips on the latest trends and tools in the industry. <br><br>  Here is a link to an article in my blog that can help with this issue: <a href="http://www.kaushik.net/avinash/web-analysis-inhouse-or-outsourced-or-something-else/">www.kaushik.net/avinash/web-analysis-inhouse-or-outsourced-or-something-else</a> <br><br>  <b>In Russia at the moment there is a problem of misunderstanding by clients of the value of web analytics services, and accordingly clients are not willing to pay a sufficient price for the services of companies in this area.</b>  <b>What are the budgets for web analytics companies spend in Europe, the United States and how well is this market developed there?</b>  . <br><br>  This problem is not unique to Russia.  It may be more common in your country, as the web analytics industry is still at an early stage of its development in RuNet, but many web analytics experts I work with all over the world (Spain, Norway, Brazil, Hong Kong and even the USA ) face the same problem. <br><br>  I see two main reasons. <br><br>  With the exception of those who make huge profits, many companies do not take the Internet space seriously. Accordingly, there is no way to convince them to pay for web analytics services.  I often call myself the ‚Äúdigital marketing evangelist‚Äù because my goal is to get companies to think more creatively about the potential of the Internet and to discover all of its limitless possibilities.  If companies realize what heights can be achieved by properly using the Internet space, they will be ready to invest. <br><br>  Another reason for the unpopularity of the sphere - we, experts in web analytics.  Despite the fact that we have access to a huge amount of valuable data, we continue to create stupid reports containing dry numbers, such as the number of clicks, impressions and page views.  These indicators are certainly good, but they do not contain real conclusions.  We should include visitor loyalty, bounce rate, economic value, and many other indicators that really help us understand how effective our actions are.  We, as web analytics specialists, should get away from template reports using a unique approach for each project.  We need to constantly use advanced segmentation.  We need to conduct an effective analysis.  That's what people want to pay for.  No one wants to pay for dry reports. <br><br>  If we are aware of these two reasons and will constantly deal with them, then I‚Äôm just sure that Russian companies will be willing to pay good money for web analytics services. <br><br>  <b>Now the market of web analytics services in Russia is at the initial stage of development.</b>  <b>How do you evaluate his prospects?</b> <br><br>  I love the Internet and admire his ability to change business and influence society.  I am extremely optimistic about his future. <br><br>  I am delighted with the changes that are happening in Russia.  I see promising signs in how companies develop their strategies.  Therefore, I am optimistic about the future of the web analytics market.  The fact that iMetrics conference will take place in Russia in November is an excellent confirmation of my thoughts.  And I am very pleased that I will become a part of this wonderful event. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129178/</a></p>
