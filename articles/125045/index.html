Emmanuel is a world-class expert in interactive marketing, SocialMedia and Internet reputation.</i>  <i>At various times, his clients included BIC, Orange, Chanel, Givenchy, P &amp; G, Sony, Warner Bros, Disney, Fox, Cartier, Guerlain, Jean Paul Gaultier, Danone, Coca-Cola, ArcelorMittal, Symantec, and others. Emanuel also co-founded the company Vanksen (one of the leading international agencies for advertising and promotion in social media) and BuzzParadise (the largest advertising network of bloggers, which includes 9000 influential blogs in 12 countries).</i>  <i>I hope this interview will be interesting to you.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Emmanuel, where is digital going now?</b>  <b>What will be the next trend in social networks?</b> <br><br>  The biggest trend of recent times is the connection of the real and the virtual.  A few years ago, you only had internet at home and at work, and you had to wait a few hours to tell the world any news.  Now, with the advent of the Internet in mobile phones, everything has changed - you can communicate with your friends anywhere and anytime. <br><br>  Another trend, of course, geolocation services.  If you look at Foursquare or any other company (I know that there are a couple in Russia too), you will notice that they can communicate with the consumer directly at points of sale, knowing when they are going to buy something.  In addition, now users of such services can easily consult with their friends right from the fitting room before making purchases.  Of course, this greatly affects retailers, because they become subject to the influence of word of mouth - people talk about stores, even if their owners do not want it.  But this is a plus - now we can influence people who talk about your brand.

      <br>
      <b>And what can you say about technology in social networks.</b>  <b>Augmented reality is no longer a trend.</b>  <b>What will be next?</b> <br><br>  As I said earlier, geolocation services are only gaining momentum.  But if we talk about technology, then this is definitely 3D printing on 3D printers.  This new technology will allow you to print real things at home.  A 3D printer works like a regular printer, but only it prints on plastic and now also on metal.  With this technology, you can download a plate or cup from the site, and then print them.  This is just a revolution - we have never seen such a thing before. <br><br>  I also see how well TV channels are developing.  In the next couple of years, it will already be possible to have not ‚Äúchannel 1‚Äù or ‚Äúchannel 2‚Äù, but a channel of your name, with content that will be personalized and even with advertisements addressed only to you.  The most interesting thing is that even your close relatives, even your mother will not see your content. <br><br>  <b>What do you think should be the brand image in a social network?</b> <br><br>  It seems to me that brands need to become more humane and open, but not only online, because if their behavior is different online and offline, people will not like it, they will start talking about it. <br><br>  People tend to talk, so brands must be very friendly to meet expectations.  But this is the challenge for the brand - people want to communicate 24 hours 7 days a week, and companies are ready to talk only during business hours.  Therefore, many companies have to face reorganization when they start working in social networks.  In addition, many people are now thinking that the brand should have more than one representative on the network, but (like the American BestBuy, for example) - 2500 people who are ready to help at any time.  All these 2,500 people are employees of the company, and all of them are trained in social media assistance. <br><br>  <b>Emmanuel, you have your own advertising agency.</b>  <b>What services are most in demand now?</b>  <b>What is best sold in Europe?</b> <br><br>  Well, actually, I just left my agency, although I remained in charge of some projects and remained its co-owner.  But I can say that for ten years we have built communities, made viral videos with a brand message, and in general created content that would be interesting for people.  We also engaged in interactive marketing, made windows that reacted to the movement of people on the street.  We have made one of such projects for Channel - a showcase with personalized content for each person, now it is very much in demand.  Our very best solutions were users' attention, surprising, unusual, or beneficial to consumers. <br><br>  <b>And if we talk about brands, what do they want to buy today?</b>  <b>What solutions attract them?</b> <br><br>  Most of our clients always ask me about the ‚Äúgolden recipe‚Äù, but it does not exist.  Each brand is unique and has its own history, its budget, its value.  Therefore, before starting work, the company should have its own strategy.  I see a lot of brands that say they have everything in order with social media, but in fact they just opened an account on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter.  But in reality, it‚Äôs not accounts that make your company social, but your rethinking of relationships with your audience.  If you just get an account "Vkontakte" - it does not help you become more humane, open and socially responsible.  You need to have a development strategy.  And not only in social media. <br><br>  <b>Do you think that an agency or a client should write a strategy for a brand in social media?</b> <br><br>  I lead many brands because they do not understand what social media is and how to use them, but of course nobody knows their brand better than they do.  Therefore, all strategies must be born in co-creation, useful to both sides of the process.  I do not give them a direct answer to the question, but I ask them very correct questions that help them determine their social media development strategy.  Usually these questions are ‚Äúwho is your audience?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhere is it online?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat is the purpose of your online presence?‚Äù.  The client must understand very well that just a Facebook page is not a goal.  And, of course, a brand must remember its goal very well at all stages.  I often see clients forgetting what they wanted to say after a couple of months after starting work.  So, firstly, you need to answer all the questions, secondly, to prescribe the strategy, and thirdly, to choose the tools for implementation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125045/">https://habr.com/ru/post/125045/</a></p>
