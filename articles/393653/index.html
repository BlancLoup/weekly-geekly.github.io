These were the Oculus Rift CV1 and the HTC Vive PRE.  The review will be interesting to those who are now deciding which of these gadgets to buy.  And for those who just want to get acquainted for their own interest, what are these two helmets.  The video shows a detailed analysis of both helmets and content for them, and under the cut in brief about all this in text form. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/M7vsw20ujOE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhio_U62BHeD5p5q_BrJexSJ8tQ9Fw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>Specifications:</b> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/54f/294/b07/54f294b07dda4f5c9c0c4a5bacd79ea5.jpg"></div><br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aef/adf/d82/aefadfd82e1d46caa39bb7eb36fa1b28.jpg"></div><br><br>  As we can see, the devices are very similar.  The oculus wins in price and weight, but both of these victories cost little.  Why?  Look at the following points. <br><br>  <b>The convenience of use:</b> <br>  Here we share the subjective sensations, since everyone has different perceptions.  In some reviews, I read that the Oculus is more comfortable to sit on the head, that as a result of its lighter weight, the neck gets less tired and that the air conduction in it is better and the blemishes on the face are smaller than those of the viva.  So, subjectively, the HTC Vive is much more comfortable and more pleasant sitting on the head.  It can be said, softer, more elastic and comfortable.  As for the spots on the face, they are inevitable in all VR-devices. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/341/2b6/8a8/3412b68a828c49e98c483249db84470a.jpg"></div><br><br>  By the way, an important point, and do you wear glasses?  During filming, I tried on both helmets with glasses and it was convenient only in Vive.  And later on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/viacheslav.utochkin/posts/1067578986636354">fb there</a> was an interesting feedback on this topic from the user of both helmets: <br>  <i>‚ÄúFor example, I practically could not use Rift with glasses.</i>  <i>Due to the fact that, unlike Vive, it is impossible to adjust the distance to the lenses, I spent a lot of time on fitting, constantly afraid to scratch the lenses.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>At the same time, another person with a different face shape and other glasses didn‚Äôt have such problems at all, and he used Rift's advantage in the form of putting on / taking off in the style of a baseball cap.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>And the Vive hack, with the release of a soft pad for increasing FOV and sweetspot, worked perfectly for me, but I‚Äôm not sure what it is for everyone</i> . <i>‚Äù</i> <br><br>  And once touched the eyes, then I will mention the ears.  In the Oculus Rift built-in headphones, and in the HTC Vive removable.  The Vive headphones themselves are rubbish, but if I want to turn on my cool ears when immersed in VR, then Vive wins.  If you use the native ears of the systems, the Oculus wins. <br><br>  <b>Controllers:</b> <br>  That's why the HTC Vive is $ 200 more expensive.  Because it comes with cool, intuitive controllers for virtual reality, while the Oculus comes with an Xbox controller.  In the future, Oculus promised to release its Oculus Touch VR controllers.  They will have to buy more for the same 200 bucks, which now make up the difference in the price of two devices. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/729/6d5/4a0/7296d54a09df4f95a17f294b14a8d2cb.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Required site for use:</b> <br>  Oculus can and should be used while sitting in a chair, but HTC Vive provides for movement in space.  It is necessary to allocate in the apartment a certain zone free of furniture, at the corners of which, in line of sight, the Lighthouse stations supplied with the helmet must be fixed.  By the way, in more detail about a set of delivery of HTC Vive it is possible to read in my other <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/273570/">article</a> on geektimes.  Zone sizes: from 1.5x2 to 4x5 meters. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a8/88b/8fc/3a888b8fc4e743b99a9ff64529d30b52.JPG"></div><br><br>  This is an important difference between the two systems.  On the one hand, all the content for Vive is steeper due to the fact that you really move through the virtual space, moving your body in real.  On the other hand, many simply do not have the necessary space at home, but what can I say - some of the kitchens have less !!!  Well, besides, in 20-30 minutes of play an unusual person in Vive gets tired of the constant movement. <br><br>  <b>Content:</b> <br>  Subjectively, playing Vive, requiring movement and using controllers, is much better than playing Oculus with an Xbox joystick.  Here is the truth, shooting archery or chopping katana vegetables, at certain moments I caught a complete immersion and forgot that I was in a room with a plastic in my hands and that I didn‚Äôt even smell a sword here. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bf1/9dc/e87/bf19dce8702e4ad5891e6e9c32253c38.jpg"></div><br><br>  <b>Findings:</b> <br>  In the text of the article, I gave a very brief extract from the fact that I had spoken to the camera.  But here are the conclusions completely.  So: <br><br>  <b>Opinion 1:</b> "The <i>oculus is an excellent helmet, it fits well on the head. But there is a small gap from the bottom, there is a problem that the built-in headphones are not always needed if I want to use my own for example. My choice is Vive, because with it You can move around the room, you can see the walls, you can shoot a bow, you can do a lot of things that you can‚Äôt do in the oculus. But the oculus is also good for an apartment, a room where you just have to sit in a chair. From the games under the oculus, you like Lucky's Tale, third-person platformer. This is what I think is necessary for VR n</i>  <i>By this stage, I really liked vive The Lab -. This game from Valve, as the official demo with all the possibilities and all the setting, the most popular virtual reality Cool archery, pet dog in virtual reality -. it is generally an incredible feeling.</i> " <br><br>  <b>Opinion 2:</b> ‚Äú <i>I liked the HTC Vive most of all the impressions that the helmet brings. However, I need a room, I need a platform to play it. And I don‚Äôt always have enough space at home. Therefore, I‚Äôll buy myself an Oculus. impressions from games, and impressions from dressing on the head, namely HTC Vive</i> . " <br><br>  <b>Opinion 3:</b> " <i>If you look at the helmet from the point of view of the buyer, then you probably need to wait a little bit. Because now we compared the helmets, but we don‚Äôt have a helmet from Sony. And also Vive was a little bit quicker and he has hands, now there are no hands on the oculus. And this is a completely dishonest comparison. When hands are a completely different level of immersion. But if you are a game developer and want to develop your game for virtual reality, you do something good for that helmet that you have , or which you like, or if you don‚Äôt have one at all, do</i>  <i>od mobile VR, because in development you can say a lot more interesting things and now here is in your hands what kind of first VR experience will be for any of the players who have not yet encountered virtual reality. If it is good, high-quality and you do it with your soul, then you will do a good deed. Therefore, the helmets are both good, technically both are excellent, so what do you choose - decide for yourself :-)</i> " </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/393653/">https://habr.com/ru/post/393653/</a></p>
