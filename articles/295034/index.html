    </i>  <i>How much time today, with your experience, will it take you to master a new language (new frame) in order to work at the level of an average developer?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>How much in wages did you lose when you decided to learn a new specialty?</i> <br><br><h2>  QA =&gt; Java </h2><br>  A young tester, almost yesterday's graduate, with one and a half years of experience during his studies, went to work as a QA specialist in a promising international company.  The starting salary is 70 000 rubles, that is, ‚Äúalready on hand‚Äù.  The company offered opportunities for professional growth, but after a while it became boring to search for bugs and write algorithms.  There was a desire to become a Java Developer.  Pretty soon, managed to reach the position of Junior Developer with a salary of 35 000 rubles.  According to our candidate, it took him about six months to fully enter a new position. <br><br>  <b>TOTAL:</b> <br>  Testing experience - less than 2 years. <br>  Lowering the salary during the transition - 2 times. <br>  Mastering a new specialty - 6 months. <br><br><h2>  C ++ =&gt; Java </h2><br>  Experienced C ++ Developer has long worked in a large and stable American company.  Friends who, in principle, recruited only employees who were personally known to them to the newly opened branch of an international company, offered an unexpected option: forget about the old experience, learn a new specialty.  True, they also offered a salary 2 times higher, which served as the final argument in favor of becoming a novice specialist again.  It took about a year to fully enter the post. <br><br>  <b>TOTAL:</b> <br><br>  Experience With ++ developer - more than 7 years. <br>  Salary increase during the transition - 2 times. <br>  Mastering a new Java developer specialty - 12 months. <br><br><h2>  Axapta =&gt; PL / SQL Oracle </h2><br><br>  The candidate received a specialized education at the Polytechnic University of St. Petersburg, was always interested in databases, participated in competitions held by Oracle, and even wrote a diploma in the development of Oracle.  However, at the end of the university, for financial reasons, he entered a small company, Axapta Developer, where he worked for 2.5 years.  But still decided to return to what really interested.  I risked money, went out as an Oracle PL / SQL development intern with a 2-fold decrease in revenue.  But the motivation and specialized education allowed him to pass the necessary attestation and get a promotion in just two months. <br><br>  <b>TOTAL:</b> <br>  Experience Axapta developer 2.5 years + specialized education. <br>  Lowering the salary during the transition - 2 times. <br>  Mastering a new PL / SQL Oracle developer specialty is 2 months. <br><br><h2>  What are we? </h2><br><br>  Recruitment managers often face an impossible task: the budget contains X money, the Project Manager brings a serious list of requirements to the selection department and explains that the developer is needed tomorrow, otherwise ... money and absolutely not willing to compromise.  According to the experience of iChar recruiters, the next most often happens next: <br><br>  The project manager listens to the recruiter, finds leverage to increase the budget to at least 1.2X + bonus.  The search continues, it takes another two weeks, two candidates agreed to come for an interview.  Both meet the requirements, both liked the head.  One candidate explicitly announced that he was worth 1.5x money and disagree with less.  The second agrees to go to the company if offered 1.3x money. <br><br>  After another week of preparation of analyzes of the wages market, painful correspondence with the management and negotiations with the candidate, the necessary funds are found and - lo and behold!  - you call your "star" with a ready job offer. <br>  "Thank!  Very good.  But you know, when I said at this place that I was leaving, they immediately offered me the very 1.5X.  And the interesting project was transferred, so I'm staying. ‚Äù <br><br>  Familiar? <br><br>  On the sixth week of the search, a decision is made to attract a recruiting agency: ‚ÄúIf you couldn‚Äôt do it yourself, then we‚Äôll try to find it for money?‚Äù  But you can take the less experienced, which in a couple of months will be able to give the desired result and it will cost much less. <br>  Your actions? <br><br>  Philologists often joke that they absolutely do not care what topic they write their dissertation on.  Basic professional skills are enough: the ability to work with a large amount of information, knowledge of the rules of presentation of the material and simple logic.  Due to such specialists, there is a huge market for the sale of essays, coursework and even doctoral theses. <br><br>  A good education and serious work experience increases the chances of successfully mastering an adjacent specialty and increases the motivation to work in the company.  Of course, situations are different, and sometimes it is impossible to deviate from the requirements.  But very often, consulting with a specialist from a specialized recruitment agency will help save time, find a compromise solution where it is needed, or still find an expensive ‚Äústar‚Äù - but only when it is really necessary. <br><br>  And finally, a few arguments from developers with experience of more than 15 years: <br><br>  <b><i>‚ÄúGraduates of MatFeh are taught to think, so I can switch to any language.</i></b>  <b><i>It will take me 2 weeks to enter the project and about a year to become an expert. ‚Äù</i></b> <b><br></b>  <b>Senior Java Developer</b> <br><br>  <b><i>‚ÄúIf I need to master Java, then in order to start writing work projects, it will take from a week to a month.</i></b>  <b><i>But in order to create something masterly - the whole life! ‚Äù</i></b> <b><br></b>  <b>Senior C # Developer</b> <br><br>  Olga Andreeva for iChar </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295034/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295034/</a></p>
