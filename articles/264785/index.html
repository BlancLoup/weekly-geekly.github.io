  <section class="page js-page"><h1>VNXe Storage Family - Small Business Solution at Reasonable Prices</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/787/7d2/876/7877d2876b5e49769aa0d825c4fbaedb.jpg"><br><br>  Each company in the process of its growth is faced with the problem of the growth of IT infrastructure. <br>  It is clear that when the whole company has 3-4 PCs and they all stand in the same room, the problem of collaboration and data protection is successfully solved with the help of ordinary USB sticks and external USB-drives. <br>  However, in the process of growth, the organization at one point moves to the next stage of development of the IT infrastructure. <br>  When the number of computers reaches 10-15, it is more convenient to store data on some kind of unified storage, in which the data will be available regardless of whether a particular user PC is turned on or not. <br>  Of course, you can build a similar storage based on a conventional PC with multiple disks and free software for creating a NAS. <br>  However, this causes several problems at once: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1) Such storage has several points of failure at once (for example, a motherboard or a disk controller), which means that at any moment all the work of the company can completely stop. <br>  2) Untested components from different manufacturers do not always get along well in a single solution.  This means that unexpected failures can occur at any arbitrary time. <br>  3) In case of failure of the RAID controller, we need to look for exactly the same in order to remove data from disks, which can be problematic 4-5 years after the system is assembled. <br>  4) Support for this decision falls entirely on the shoulders of the sysadmin, and the cost of spare parts - on the company's budget. <br>  Some of these problems are solved in low-cost storage systems from various manufacturers (both eminent and virtually unknown). <br>  However, most of them are still built on a single motherboard per system, and the support leaves much to be desired (especially in terms of time). <br>  A way out of this impasse can be found if you look at storage systems from leading world manufacturers, for example, EMC. <br>  The fact is that in the EMC lineup there is not only storage systems for large companies, but also solutions for those who are just beginning to grow. <br>  These are systems of the <a href="http://comptek.ru/ic/cl:hbr:vnxe/vendor/emc2/products/VNXe.html">VNXe</a> family. <br>  They have all the capabilities of larger EMC storage systems, but they are much cheaper. <br>  Now the main storage systems of this family are VNXe3200 and the VNXe1600 that has just appeared. <br>  Meanwhile, there are still systems of the previous generation on sale: VNXe3150, VNXe3300 and VNXe3100. <br>  By the way, the systems of the previous generation <a href="http://comptek.ru/ic/cl:hbr:vnxe_stock/news/emc2/1878">can be bought with a significant discount</a> , which is important for a small company, whose IT budget is not at all rubber. <br>  As a result, regardless of which system will be purchased, the company receives a reliable, easy-to-manage, productive data storage system, the warranty service of which is performed directly at the customer‚Äôs site without stopping the system. <br>  That is exactly the same as in the Mid-Range or Hi-End systems. <br>  Thus, buying EMC VNXe systems, the company avoids several problems at once: <br>  ‚ÄúFirst, without exception, all EMC products undergo strict factory testing immediately after assembly.  This means that the probability of failure of any node is minimal. <br>  ‚ÄúSecondly, all EMC storage systems are designed so that they lack a single point of failure.  Therefore, even if some component of the system fails, it will not affect the availability or integrity of the data.  Users just won't notice it. <br>  Well, and thirdly, unlike users, the support service employees immediately find out about the failed node.  And in the case of a complex problem, the best EMC specialists will be connected to its solution, just as in the case of older systems. <br><br>  <i>Vladimir, a trading company system administrator with 150 users:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúThe VNXe3200 system has improved the quality of the services provided and reduced the workload of the staff.</i>  <i>Due to the flexible configuration for use with different load profiles, it was possible to improve the performance of services operating in a virtualized environment. ‚Äù</i>

      Integrity and completeness of the solution ensures correct processing of the system‚Äôs failure and automatic fast recovery in case of infrastructure failure. <br>  All this together with an extremely simple and intuitive control interface allows the system to be efficiently operated by personnel having only basic knowledge of storage systems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/264785/">https://habr.com/ru/post/264785/</a></p>
