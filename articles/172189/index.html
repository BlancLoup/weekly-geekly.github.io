  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is important in the team</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Have you ever tried to taste drinking water?  There are many different brands and you need to choose one that you will drink every day.  You need to have a very delicate taste to recognize the mineral properties that highlight this particular brand.  If you also remove the labels on the bottles, it becomes even harder to choose.  Without distinguishing between taste, you can choose three brands in a row, being sure that you are trying the same water.  Isn‚Äôt it the same if you create a team of strangers? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Imagine that you are a boss who employs several people.  It turns out that they studied on the same stream at the university and they know each other well.  However, it would be a mistake to assume that these people work well together.  Before forming a team, you need to know each potential member of the team.  Learn the personal motivation of each and present his role in the team.  If everyone fulfills your instructions thoroughly, but fails to make an important decision, you are doomed to control every step of the team until someone develops the necessary qualities of a leader.  Always make clear what role each team member takes on.  A team of defenders alone will be able to tie, but will not be able to score the ball.  However, the team should not be created from people unrelated to each other.  This is the case when a fire started in the apartment from the next entrance.  People jumped out into the street, and the residents of another entrance, standing aside, are happy that the fire is not in their half, while others are trying to find the source of the fire, help to pull out at least some part of the property, are worried about the children and cause firefighters.  Such a team will always be divided into separate subgroups. <br><br>  <b>Consolidation</b> .  I remember the match with the Brazilian football team.  The team conducted a series of good attacks and took the lead.  By the end of the second half, the attack and defense players are tired.  The coach spent on the field replacement as follows.  He led the field to a fresh midfielder.  The player was very beautiful dribbling, it seemed the ball was glued to his foot and the opponents could not do anything with him in the center of the field.  However, this player never before the end of the game could not make a dangerous attack for the enemy or give an assist pass.  And despite this, he was in his place, he stretched the time until the end of the game with his ball control technique and left the score winning.  What would happen if a player entered the field from the very beginning of the game?  The team would not be able to show itself so well, because a clear coherence would break.  While one is improving his technique and trying to go to the shock position alone, the team, over and over again, loses the opportunity to show their teamwork skills.  It is extremely important, being in a team, to know for what everything is done. <br><br>  <b>Acquaintance</b> .  For a team to achieve good results, its members must be sure that they are not indifferent to each other.  If someone cares only about themselves, the whole team will suffer.  How to be in this situation?  All that is needed is communication, conversation.  Some events where all team members can not only talk with each other, but also get to know each other better.  It is extremely important not to let such events take their course.  Subconsciously, people tend to prefer the old proven groups - and newcomers will be forced to look for their group, so as not to feel embarrassed.  It is important to spend time with those you do not know well.  Adaptation of new team members will probably always be one of the most important problems.  Even despite the fact that others know what it is to be in their place.

      <b>The pursuit of averaging</b> .  Let's say they give you a new partner.  You adore Celine Dion, both are ill for Zenith, and do not know how to take the bar.  But the goal was not to make your life easier, nor to restore peace of mind.  The goal was to make a three of two units, a four - as much as possible.  It is a synergistic effect that is the goal.  In such a team formed a new motivation.  For everyone it becomes important not even high, but not low efficiency, so that there are no outsiders, but there are no clearly defined leaders.  The heart can not issue three daily allowances without harm to all other organs.  In a consolidated team it is extremely difficult to make changes by submitting an order from above.  This is often associated with a change in the position and status of team members, ousting them from their niche.  Given the team's desire for averaging, we have to deal with stability.  And here the leader‚Äôs role is to set the right goal, not hoping for self-motivation.  Coherence is extremely important for large groups, the success of the organization depends on it, but not all leaders teach their subordinates teamwork.  Most of them simply do not know how to teach this, and often confront people with a situation, with the expectation that the group itself will adopt the necessary skills.  In this case, an important role is played by the amendments along the way.  A good team is not always the sum of its components, but its effectiveness must be expressed in synergy. <br><br>  <b>Development</b>  When members of your team follow the same goal and support each other, the team is ready to develop.  This development is extremely important.  Without them, the team and each participant individually can not become better.  Development in a team is like a marriage relationship.  If the development of one family member does not occur mutually, then in the end two different lines of fate are obtained.  Two lives go in parallel, but separately.  Participants cease to act together and even together.  The distance increases so much that team members no longer see where the other is.  In the end, in a critical situation, the removed team members are left alone, and the team does not know how to help them.  Without communication, the team is likely to fall apart.  Therefore, it is extremely important to follow the development of the team and each of its members in particular.  It is necessary to push those lagging behind the development of the participants and give them a motive for self-development.  For the team it is important to create all the conditions for joint growth. <br><br>  <b>Open communication</b>  It is very important to create a climate for open communication, when all proposals and criticism can speak freely.  To do this, practice the meeting, which find out common problems, share information.  Everyone should be heard, without fear of immediately receiving harsh criticism or being interrupted by those who are used to speaking.  Such behavior helps to avoid the closure of chain links and reduce the life cycle of local conflicts. <br><br>  <b>Trust</b> .  If one of the team members can shift part of the work to another without undue shame, because he understands the importance of helping a more experienced person without trying to manipulate them, then this participant is aware of his or her weaknesses and trusts his partner.  Trust allows the team to compensate for the shortcomings of each separately.  In such a team, the emergence of individuality, characteristic of the whole group, which gives efficiency in work, appears.  Trust, in turn, gives rise to the realization of mutual interests.  If we direct the joint efforts correctly, the team will be able to realize that personal success will come along with the success of the whole team.  But if you do not encourage personal success, personal dedication can decline.  When gold miners do not find even grains of gold, they will continue to search for a place of a new mine. <br><br>  Several points that deserve attention before moving on to a more general grouping: <br><ul><li>  <b>People need to know what is expected of them</b> .  Often receiving a task, the team does not know to the end what is expected of them.  It is very important to discuss the roles of each.  The team itself can set priorities, but it needs to know at least the expected deadlines for implementation, the resources that the team has at its disposal, the reward for execution. </li><li>  <b>Team members must have one or another way of self-expression and reaction to it</b> .  This may be involved in planning or implementation. </li><li>  <b>Evaluate the work of your colleagues</b> .  If a participant does not receive a reaction to his work, he will consider his efforts insufficient, taking the work harder, and later will accept his role as unnecessary. </li><li>  <b>The team should be attentive to the unwarded.</b> </li><li>  <b>Difficult moments the team must decide together.</b>  Thus, more experienced colleagues have the opportunity to share their knowledge. </li><li>  <b>The team should make a plan of action</b> .  People need to know what is expected of them. </li><li>  <b>Team of teams</b> .  Installations and desires alone may not be enough.  In a group of people it is necessary to prepare the ground for change, the psychological atmosphere.  Before that, I relied on a group of people, calling them one team.  However, the team may consist of other teams.  What can unite and rally the group in such a situation?  Each subgroup will treat the other group as a beginner, preferring its own circle.  This is a good test for the general team leader.  He should be the conductor, managing the environment and the atmosphere of his subordinates.  It is not necessary in this case to talk about universal cohesion.  It is important to keep the spirit up. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Reward</b>  Over the past few years of work, I do not remember that any team was encouraged publicly.  Any praise skipped over its first stage, hurrying to complete.  I didn‚Äôt even know what colleagues outside of my team were working on.  At some point, man has little ordinary praise.  Simply, praise, without awareness of the work done or proper assessment of dedication, becomes a blank.  It is extremely important for managers to learn not only to praise, but also to understand what exactly is the object of praise. <br><br>  <b>Support</b>  Having achieved good results is difficult not to go the distance if a lot of effort is spent.  Permanent winners are always harder to lose.  It is always hard to win.  However, elation is crucial.  It can act as a driving force for innovation or change.  It is easier to conduct changes in a team with a pronounced atmosphere of recovery than in a team that has lost heart and does not believe in the effectiveness of changes.  The ability to show the success of some as a common success lies on the shoulders of the leader.  Groups inspired by the success of others will receive a positive charge. <br><br>  <b>Common language</b> .  There is a famous joke.  One woman bought a parrot at a pet store.  But the next day she came back and asked for money, since the parrot did not say a word.  She was advised to put a mirror in the cage, saying that parrots love to look at their reflection.  But the next day the woman returned, the parrot was still silent.  The seller advised to buy a rocker for the bird, as the parrots love to spend time.  In the morning the woman returned again.  Her parrot is dead.  But before he died, he managed to ask if they were selling food at that store. <br>  Many managers can be projected on the image of this woman.  They are waiting for results from their subordinates, and when returns do not occur, they begin to use everything that, according to experts, should help.  However, the easiest way is to simply ask people what they need.  It is very important to achieve openness.  Often, bosses do not try to earn respect from subordinates, being content with just the right of a leader.  Such a leader will not be able to cause a person to be frank.  The conversation will be reduced to the popular aphorism: "they found a common language and spoke in common phrases."  In this case, you will have to start the team again. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Raising the spirit helps the team cope with difficulties</b> .  It is difficult to always remain an optimist, but such high spirits are more productive than depression or stress. </li><li>  <b>Praise for the sake of praise is not effective</b> .  Praise as an expression of our emotions makes it often clear that you are happy with the result and are grateful to the person.  But it is important to remember exactly what the person did. </li><li>  <b>General motivation is always supported by a personal goal.</b> </li><li>  <b>The victory of one can be a positive charge for many</b> .  You must use all available methods to lift the spirit within the team. </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172189/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172189/</a></p>
