  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Freelance problems, or why we created Kwork</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It is obvious that freelance in runet is bad.  For the customer, this is a bottomless barrel: there is no clear pricing (estimates for simple work may differ manyfold and dozens of times), there is no protection for the interests of those who pay (prepayment protects the contractor, but not the customer).  I decided to order something on freelance - be ready for long discussions and negotiations, filling out briefs and test tasks.  At the same time there is always a risk that the freelancer will suddenly disappear, will stop responding to mail and Skype.  Long, expensive, uncomfortable. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cef/1e5/d97/cef1e5d97fe54152a70129a58db2be79.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  But for most of the tasks TK or discussions are not required at all - these are routine small things of the type to make up a page, to correct a photo, to sketch a business card or a logo.  That is, a bunch of small tasks, where you just need to go in and choose someone who can do it quickly without any further discussion, much less without negotiating a price.  How many times each of us either refused the task, or did it himself just because it was easier and faster to do it himself than to explain and choose a freelancer.

      Freelancers have another problem ... <a name="habracut"></a>  With the exception of top performers who can put any price tags and continue to receive orders, most freelancers live from order to order.  We need to constantly monitor tenders on various exchanges, place bids and hope that one of the customers will finally bite.  And if you often add inadequate requirements and expectations of customers, then the picture, in general, becomes sad. <br><br>  This situation does not suit both parties.  And something had to change.  That is why we launched <b><a href="http://kwork.ru/ref/19963">Kwork</a></b> . <br><br><h5>  <b>Idea Kwork: ‚ÄúSupermarket freelancing services.</b>  <b>All for 500 rubles "</b> </h5><br>  We initially set a goal to get rid of unproductive discussions, unnecessary tenders, price negotiations and other disappointing features of freelance exchanges.  All this is not in online stores and marketplaces - you simply choose a product, pay for it and wait for delivery. <br><br>  Using the example of Fiverr service, we saw that services can be sold in the same way as products in online stores.  The service at <a href="http://kwork.ru/ref/19963"><b>Kwork</b></a> seems to be wrapped in a food wrapper - the freelancer indicates in advance what is included in the product: for example: ‚Äú <a href="http://kwork.ru/Logo/2600/sozdam-logotip-v-3-variantah%3Fref%3D19963"><b>Three logos for 500 rubles</b></a> ‚Äù.  And in the description of his product gives detailed information about what and how he will do. <br><br>  Tenders and tedious negotiations are no longer needed, we have a supermarket of services.  I chose, paid for and wait for delivery (from 1 hour to several days depending on the type of service).  Need a <b><a href="http://kwork.ru/categories/Logo%3Fref%3D19963">logo</a></b> , <a href="http://kwork.ru/categories/frontend%3Fref%3D19963"><b>layout</b></a> , <a href="http://kwork.ru/categories/links%3Fref%3D19963"><b>links from the "fat" sites</b></a> ?  Great, add to cart, pay and wait for the result. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eea/609/df2/eea609df2a074ecdb19b127970fbc732.jpg" alt="Kwork freelance"></div><br><br>  All services (quorque) on <a href="http://kwork.ru/ref/19963"><b>Kwork</b></a> cost only 500 rubles.  Freelance sellers themselves decide how much they are willing to lay in this price.  For example, advertising video is a difficult job, and sellers immediately write that the price of the basic service is 500 rubles.  enters, for example, 15 seconds of video.  If you need a video length of 1 minute, then pay 4 kvorka.  The final price is always clear and transparent in advance.  As a result, we have: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/519/2c8/dc9/5192c8dc915c44099cff57ebadcc781c.png" alt="image"></div><br><br><h5>  <b>Change the paradigm</b> </h5><br>  And the most amazing thing is that Kwork completely changes the paradigm of customer-freelancer relations.  There is no longer a freelancer, there is a seller, and instead of a customer there is a buyer.  This trifle changes everything: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>The freelancer begins to feel like a salesman, and the value of each client increases for him.</b>  He studies the market himself and offers popular services.  He seeks to increase sales, providing the best service.  Instead of wasting time on tenders and discussions, he makes every effort to accelerate the delivery of services and customer satisfaction. </li><li>  <b>A customer</b> who has never experienced any pleasure in ordering services from freelancers suddenly <b>sees how great it is to buy all services in one place with a few mouse clicks</b> .  There is a real excitement: "wow, I will order this quark, and one and the other - they are all so cool." </li></ul><br>  The value of the service, that is, the level of customer service, increases dramatically.  Kwork ranks higher than those services that provide better service.  This is determined on the basis of indicators such as: <br><br><ul><li>  Feedback on the results of works submitted (by the way, the lack of feedback is a bad signal) </li><li>  Repeat orders from the same customers </li><li>  Freelancer refusals of tasks and delay (of course, it disappoints the client) </li></ul><br>  The top quickly take the best services from the best performers - while none of them think to raise prices.  And it is so nice after the ‚Äúwild‚Äù freelancing to relax and enjoy the order of services. <br><br><h5>  <b>We cut expenses, we raise profitability</b> </h5><br>  A well-known fact: labor productivity in Russia is significantly lower than in Western countries: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4bd/a3b/0e9/4bda3b0e9e1649f5a1174565e903ea6e.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  This means that we do a lot of work idling and therefore have lower profitability.  The problem is solved by cost reduction and automation.  That is, you need to stop spending a lot of money and human resources on a routine and throw them on what makes a profit. <br><br>  In this regard, <b><a href="http://kwork.ru/ref/19963">Kwork</a></b> solves two important tasks: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Saving money</b> through transparency and <b>value</b> for <b>money</b> </li><li>  <b>Saving of time</b> due to the absence of unnecessary negotiations, discipline of performers and high-quality service </li></ul><br>  The difference between a company that is actively increasing profits and turnover, and one that is barely making ends meet is the ability to save.  In this regard, <b><a href="http://kwork.ru/ref/19963">Kwork</a></b> - just a <b><a href="http://kwork.ru/ref/19963">godsend</a></b> . <br><br>  Already (4 months after launch) about 10,000 different services can be found at Kwork, several thousand tasks are performed every month, and customer satisfaction metrics are very, very pleased. <br><br>  <b>All readers of Megamind who want to try <b><a href="http://kwork.ru/ref/19963">Kwork</a></b> in business, give a bonus of 250 rubles to the account (valid for two days from the moment of activation).</b>  <b>For a bonus, contact the LAN.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299094/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299094/</a></p>
