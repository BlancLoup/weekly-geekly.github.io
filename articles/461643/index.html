  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How did you go to the Alfa Bank School of System Analysis?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Large IT-companies have long held schools for students and graduates of engineering and mathematical specialties.  Who has not heard of the Yandex School of Data Analysis or the HeadHunter School of Programmers?  The age of these projects is already measured in a decade. <br><br>  Banks are not behind them.  It is enough to recall Sberbank School 21, Raiffeisen Java School or Fintech Tinkoff.ru School.  These projects are designed not only to give theoretical knowledge, but also to develop practical skills, form a portfolio of a young specialist, increase his chances of finding a job. <br><br>  At the end of May, we announced the first admission to <a href="https://hr.alfabank.ru/events/shkola-sistemnogo-analiza-alfa-banka">the</a> Alfa Bank <a href="https://hr.alfabank.ru/events/shkola-sistemnogo-analiza-alfa-banka">School of System Analysis</a> .  Two months have passed, the set is over.  Today I want to tell you how it went and what could have been done differently.  I invite all interested under cat.

At the first stage, candidates were asked to apply for participation by filling out and sending a special questionnaire.  Based on the analysis of the questionnaires received, a group of candidates was formed, who were invited to the second stage - an interview with the Bank‚Äôs system analysts.  Candidates who have successfully proven themselves in the interview were invited to study at the ShSA.  All invitees, in turn, confirmed their readiness to participate in the project. <br><br><h1>  Stage I. Questioning </h1><br>  The school is designed for people without experience or with little experience in IT in general and in system analysis in particular.  People who understand what systems analysis is and what systems analyst does.  People seeking to develop in this area.  The first step was to search for candidates matching these criteria. <br><br>  To search for suitable candidates, a questionnaire was developed, the answers to the questions of which would allow us to determine whether the candidate meets our expectations.  The questionnaire was made on the basis of Google Forms, and we placed links to it on several resources, including Facebook, VKontakte, Instagtam, Telegram, and, of course, Habr. <br><br>  The collection of questionnaires lasted three weeks.  During this time, 188 applications for participation in the ShA were received.  Most of them (36%) came from Habr. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/vb/dy/ckvbdyyuydfbl9q30bp9uzs28j0.jpeg"><br><br>  We made a special channel in the working Slack and placed the applications received there.  The Bank‚Äôs system analysts participating in the recruitment got acquainted with the posted questionnaires and then voted on each candidate. <br><br>  Voting consisted of putting down marks, significant of which were: <br><br><ol><li>  The candidate is suitable for training - plus (code: heavy_plus_sign :). </li><li>  The candidate is not suitable for training - minus (code: heavy_minus_sign :). </li><li>  The candidate is an employee of Alfa Group (code: alfa2 :). </li><li>  The candidate is recommended to be invited to a tech interview (code: hh :). </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oi/2i/vx/oi2ivx8tvyieufffm9ey8kr1myg.png"><br><br>  Based on the results of the voting, we divided the candidates into groups: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>It is recommended to invite for an interview.</b>  These guys scored a total score (the sum of pluses and minuses) of more than or equal to five, are not employees of Alfa Group and are not recommended for an invitation to a tech interview.  The group included 40 people.  It was decided to invite them to the second stage of recruitment in the ShA. </li><li>  <b>It is recommended to invite for runs.</b>  Candidates in this group are employees of Alfa Group.  There were 10 people in the group.  It was decided to form a separate stream from them and invite the School to lectures and seminars. </li><li>  <b>It is recommended to consider the position of a systems analyst.</b>  According to voters, the candidates in this group have competencies sufficient to undergo a technical interview for the position of the Bank‚Äôs system analyst.  The group included 33 people.  They were asked to send a resume and go through the hr-selection process. </li><li>  <b>It is recommended to terminate the application.</b>  The group included all other candidates - 105 people.  They decided to refuse further consideration of the application for participation in the ShSA. </li></ol><br><h1>  Stage II.  Interviewing </h1><br>  Based on the results of the survey, the participants of the first group were invited to an interview with the Bank‚Äôs system analysts.  At the second stage, we sought not only to get to know the candidates better, focusing on our criteria.  Interviewers tried to understand how candidates think and ask questions. <br><br>  The interview was built around five questions.  The responses were evaluated by two system analysts of the Bank, each on a ten-point scale.  Thus, the candidate could score a maximum of 20 points.  In addition to evaluations, the interviewers left a short summary of the results of the meeting with the candidate.  Grades and resumes were used to select future students of the School. <br><br>  36 interviews were conducted (4 candidates were not able to participate in the second stage).  Based on the results of 26, both interviewers rated the candidates equally.  For 9 candidates, the scores differed by one point.  For only one candidate, the difference in grades was 3 points. <br><br>  At the meeting on the organization of the School, it was decided to invite 18 people to study.  A threshold of 15 points was also established based on the results of the interview.  He was overcome by 14 candidates.  Four more students were selected from candidates with 13 and 14 points, based on resumes made by interviewers. <br><br>  In total, 18 candidates with different work experience were invited to the ShSA according to the results of the recruitment.  All invitees confirmed their readiness for training. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uu/yl/-p/uuyl-pbcqcpmwdj-82g7rlblzuc.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  What could be different </h1><br>  The first set in the ShA is completed.  Experience gained in organizing such events.  Identified areas of growth. <br><br>  <b>Timely and clear feedback on the receipt of the application of the candidate.</b>  Initially, it was supposed to do with standard Google Forms tools.  The candidate sends the application.  The form informs him that the application has been sent.  However, during the first week, we received feedback from several candidates that they did not understand whether their application was received or not.  As a result, with a delay of a week, we began to send candidates by e-mail confirmation that their application was received and accepted for consideration.  Hence the conclusion - the feedback on the receipt of the application of the candidate should be clear and timely.  In our case, it was not entirely clear initially.  And having cleared up, she was sent to the candidates with a delay. <br><br>  <b>Convert insignificant and absent votes to significant ones.</b>  In the voting process, insignificant marks were used at the first stage (for example, it is now impossible to make a decision on a candidate - code: thinking :).  Also, different candidates received a different number of votes (one could get 13 votes, and the second 11).  However, each new significant vote could affect the candidate‚Äôs chance of joining the ACS (both increase and decrease it).  Therefore, I would like all candidates to receive the maximum possible number of significant votes. <br><br>  <b>The right to choose for the candidate.</b>  We refused part of the candidates, proposing to send a resume and pass the selection for the position of system analyst at the Bank.  However, of those who sent the resume, not all were invited to technical interviews.  And of those who were invited to the tech interview, not everyone was able to go through it.  Perhaps, at the end of the School, the result would be different.  Therefore, such candidates should be given the right to choose.  If the candidate is confident and wants to get a job at the Bank, then let him go through the hr-selection process.  Otherwise, why not continue to consider him as a candidate for training in the ShA? <br><br>  The described approach to the recruitment of candidates is based on the hr-selection process of system analysts, which was described by Svetlana Mikheeva at <a href="https://hr.alfabank.ru/events/analyzeit-meetup-2">AnalyzeIT MeetUp # 2</a> .  The approach has its pros and cons.  It is somewhat similar to approaches to enrollment in schools of other companies, but also has its own characteristics. <br><br>  If you were selected to our School, now you know how the recruitment went.  If you are considering starting your own school, you now know how student enrollment can be organized.  If you have already conducted your own schools, it will be great if you share your experience. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/461643/">https://habr.com/ru/post/461643/</a></p>
