My name is Kate.  I'm a future werewolf!  Not in the sense that I grow fangs and fur on my back every full moon, just more and more often I think that software development is not really my vocation.  Behind the three courses at the Moscow State Technical University named after NE Bauman.  There are still three years of study.  Now the equator ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In my opinion, the topic of vocational guidance for young people is in its infancy in our country.  Can you name popular resources or proven tools to determine your professional future?  In my case, there were parents' recommendations and a random separation into physicists and lyricists while still in school.

    <h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Black or white?</font> </h3><br>  Remember how in action movies the main character had to cut the wiring stretching to the bomb?  How did he painfully choose the wire of what color to snack?  Red or yellow?  Red or yellow?  And of course, in the final seconds, fortune turns to face the hero, he makes the right choice, and everyone happily leaves for sunset.  Alas, everything is different in life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cc/c8/59ccc8103d425644309139.jpeg"><br><br>  How much time do you need to decide which coffee to drink today?  And add cinnamon?  Seconds 10?  Now let's take a popular video game in which in 60 seconds you need to assemble a set from your available tools into your post-apocalyptic bunker.  In my opinion, the choice of a future profession in your seventeen is akin to this set - you never know what to take with you: a gun or a craft product from pasta that is so dear to your heart.  Shooting from mutant cockroaches is a noble cause, of course, but there will not be enough ammo for a long time.  And then, if you still take your ‚Äúcreation‚Äù, then, firstly, there will be an opportunity to indulge in melancholy about the times when the sun was shining in the sky, and not a nuclear mushroom;  and secondly, when the supplies run out, you will not immediately try to bite off the leg of your companion in misfortune, but still bring this "macaroni" victim. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cc/c8/59ccc899b6d3a267288876.png"><br><br>  So, you have 60 seconds to decide what you will do for the rest of your life.  What options?  Bonus!  The situation is complicated by the fact that you are young and ambitious, not disappointed with the failures and consider that life is a permanent holiday. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cc/c8/59ccc8a9abffe184618627.png"><br><br>  Some in the philistine think at the level: "Whoever makes good money there and does not make much effort, I will go there."  Deputies?  Well, here it just will not work.  State  The management is an interesting thing, but most likely you will spend the best years in some Russian ‚ÄúParis‚Äù, trying to organize village self-government so that you have enough of the ‚ÄúRussian Standard‚Äù with ‚ÄúFinland‚Äù, and at the same time, neighbor Petrovich did not realize that it‚Äôs money on vodka from his pocket.  So, and who else?  Diplomats?  Well, no, you need to study too well, and even send to some Pattaya, and sit there, chew bananas, sitting in a chair that is right opposite the similarity of the trash can.  So, who stayed there?  Programmers?  Yeah, Zuckerberg.  So good.  Durov?  It's not bad too.  What do they do?  They came up with an idea, programmed it and voila.  Money is not particularly dusty, they say, you can learn some languages ‚Äã‚Äãand things will go.  Yes, and the Internet is littered with various articles "programming for 21 days."  Ok, decided!  As the saying goes: ‚ÄúBets are made!  There are no more bets! ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Nonfictional stories</font> </h3><br>  So, you spent two years preparing for exams.  Chose the direction - software development.  Determined with the university.  Received.  The cherished statement of enrollment has not yet been signed, and you already imagine yourself sitting somewhere on the Pacific coast behind the monitor of the last MacBook, and the money itself flies to your bank account. <br><br>  But after the first month, when you saw that programming was conducted by a man who found even the very first ENIAC model, but nevertheless worked on it, and believes that the best language in the world is pascal abc, doubt has crept in to you - what if Can't you fly to Hawaii?  Something obviously went wrong.  At this rate, the Pacific Ocean is not exactly reachable, but most likely you will sit on the banks of the Moskva River and write an unnecessary laboratory work to no one, complaining that life has turned to you frankly not the right place.  Well, this is just one month, then it will be better.  But every day, week, month and semester, respectively, it becomes rather worse, the ocean first became the sea, then the river, and in the end turned into a puddle near the house. <br><br>  Here you can blame anyone and anything - from the idiotic program, which was outdated even a year ago in 2010, to the teaching staff, because the majority still have fresh memories of those blissful days when the compiled code needs to wait two days.  Although there were those who, as if ‚Äúa ray of light in a dark kingdom‚Äù, tried not only to hold a seminar as soon as possible and go home to drink herbal tea, but also to interest them.  But as they say, one in the field is not a warrior.  And now, from the third semester, I finally realized - this is not all mine.  Well, I don‚Äôt like to sit behind the monitor for five hours to write a program for filling a shape using the selective pixel method.  And this is day after day, year after year.  The idea that everything is not right and not beating the brain with a hammer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cc/c8/59ccc8cbe942e362112095.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Step towards the unknown</font> </h3><br>  And now what?  What do I want?  Can leave everything as is?  And if all the same I was not destined to be a programmer, then by whom?  The question is really relevant.  If you roll back a bit, I always liked to communicate with people.  Against this background, in our small friendly company, even a peculiar game appeared - ‚Äúhook‚Äù.  It was necessary to attract the attention of the person to whom the draw would indicate.  No rules and restrictions.  I did it quite well.  I can find a common language with people. <br><br>  Recently, I accidentally stumbled upon an article about PR, I thought: ‚ÄúEureka!  This is exactly mine! ‚Äù  At first I was upset, they say, well, so, how am I going to go from programmers to PR?  And then I decided to try an internship.  So I ended up in the Parallels PR department.  On the one hand, this is an IT company, and on the other hand, there is an opportunity to look at the work of PR people from the inside.  Actually, this article can be considered an entrance exam.  Hopefully not much will stumble on me in the comments.  Did you know from your childhood that you will be programmers?  Or maybe someone, just like me, right now regrets that he didn‚Äôt move from physicists to lyrics in time? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cc/c8/59ccc8ebcbfa2945040807.png"><br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Benefits and gifts</font> </h3><br>  I know that on Habr√© love all kinds of benefits and life hacking.  Rummaged on the topic of vocational guidance and came across a few interesting resources.
