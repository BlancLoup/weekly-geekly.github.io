Part I - Philosophy and Factography</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Now the term ‚Äúpersonal media‚Äù suggests some kind of application that collects tapes for you from several sources.  This is already in the past.  Now the focus is shifted to ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù, that is, your content <b>distribution</b> channel personally, and the media can be decrypted from the Media Information System as the Media Information System. <br><br>  In order to more clearly understand what steps should be taken to create your own personal popular media and to see the directions of the development strategy, it is important to first look back and look back - how were created, developed and why did the old forms of information delivery and consumption die. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/898/acc/acf/898accacf815414b987f333d366efb71.gif">

      A bit of development philosophy: <br><br>  - For thousands of years, information was spread ‚Äúby feet and mouth‚Äù: a herald, bard, akyn or trader moved along roads and countries, telling news, squares, markets and taverns with news, edicts, tales and tales ‚Äî the same ‚Äústandard media set‚Äù that they are given us today ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  - With the advent of mass book printing, ‚Äúlong-playing‚Äù information began to flow out of oral rehearsal and stored in books, the distribution of which no longer required external carriers ‚Äî people: children got access to books in the parental home, schools, and libraries. <br><br>  - Short-term operational information continued to circulate in the "assembly points": fairs, taverns, posters with decrees (and "photos" of criminals) in the squares. <br><br>  - A couple of hundred years ago, with the advent of simple printing presses, the fate of books overtook the operational flow of information - printed leaflets, and then a different type and regularity of the newspaper captured the information field.  The assembly centers from the ‚Äúgeo-centers‚Äù of the gathering of people shifted to the editorial structure: there was so much information that people began to choose WHOM to read - the editorial board, and then journalists, began to struggle for readers / subscribers. <br><br>  - About 50 years ago, newsletters, radio and TV channels have simply become nemeryannom, but they could not accommodate crowds of eager glory journalists, ready for much / all for glory and the Pulitzer Prize.  Therefore, the emergence of the Internet and online media has become an excellent valve for journalists - there are no restrictions on the volume, regularity, but, unfortunately, the quality of materials, too. <br><br>  ‚ÄúBut grafomans, poets with kitchen verses, narrators of anecdotes, and other tabloid charms rushed through the opened internet door for the fraternity journalist.  The endless ‚Äúinternet of opportunities‚Äù grind all this mess, belched a failed ‚ÄúAlbanian Internet language‚Äù, nurtured money from failed crowds of webmasters and hosters and provided convenient blog platforms for successful and talented new journalists and editors as new THEMATIC assembly points .  Over time, bloggers / vloggers / pitchers have grown not only in audiences and influence, but also in incomes, so ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù journalists were forced to recognize popular media readers and, recently, even announce a joint industrial union. <br><br>  - The rest of the world‚Äôs population happily ‚Äúgot sick‚Äù with the desire to share everything than it‚Äôs possible to publish and migrated to distributed tavern houses in social networks and communication environments (Twitter, Steam, Periscope, Snapchat, Galaxie, etc.), in the depths of which the same processes: segmentation, popularization, monetization and selection into a separate ‚Äúassemblage point‚Äù for (by) readers. <br><br>  Humanity generates about 30 billion (!) Content units per day (tweets, emoji, photos, articles, SMS, messages, videos, etc.), of which 2 billion are public (publicly available).  EVERY DAY, not drying out for a second.  Waiting for the reactions and emotions of online associates - online strokes, comments, likes, reposts ... <br><br>  So, now practically all of the active part of humanity (20%) from morning till evening ‚Äúdrives content‚Äù for its environment, and not only self-information (about me, about my feelings, feelings, thoughts) is included in the content, but also about the surrounding world: children, parents, grandparents, cats, dogs, etc. - so half of humanity is present in the content, 12% of which do not even have or do not know how to use modern means of communication. <br><br>  In the article we are not going to consider ethical, moral, espionage and other aspects.  In the following two parts of the material we will talk in detail about the specifics - what modern information tools can help: <br><br>  1) For an individual to increase their importance among their circle of communication - let‚Äôs consider with a concrete example the creation and formation of a ‚Äúpersonal media‚Äù - a thematic channel with operational information; <br><br>  2) Multichannel / Team / Editorial staff - to increase their relevance to readers and subscribers with all the financial implications - on the example of the rapid identification of trends in today's events. <br><br>  For 03/22/2016, the significant events of the morning in the Russian-language media segment were: <br>  - The bombings in Brussels, entailed numerous victims; <br>  - Appeal to Zemfira fans with Ukrainian flags at a concert in Riga; <br>  - Results of the presentation of new Apple gadgets; <br>  - Announcement of the sentence Savchenko; <br>  - Trump's statements on NATO; <br>  - Delivery to the ISS by Cygnus truck and others. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299546/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299546/</a></p>
