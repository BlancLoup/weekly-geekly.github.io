  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Selectel: be careful weekend!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to share the unpleasant story that happened to me today.  At the same time, useful information for all Selectel customers, and for the management of the company itself (perhaps through Habr information will reach them faster than through their own support). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>So what is the point?</b>  I keep a cloud typewriter on Selectel.  She does not eat much, about 300 rubles a month.  I feed her (I replenish the balance) usually once a month.  The next payment term has come.  I make payments on weekends (there is time for that).  Today (Saturday) I made another payment through Assist (WebMoney) - 350 rubles. <br><br>  For some reason, the payment did not reach Selectel.  I waited a couple of hours and wrote in support.  And then the fun began.  I was informed that only a payment department specialist can check the payment.  And the payment department is open from 11 am on Monday.  Everything would be fine, but I still have funds in my account for the day the car runs (until mid-Sunday). <br><br>  I reported this to a support service specialist, hinting that it would be nice to accept payment at least conditionally so that the machine would not turn off.  But in response he received a refusal: ‚Äúthe ticket was postponed until Monday‚Äù.  Well, the standard word for word phrase with an apology. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Well, something needs to be done.  I turned to Assist support.  After 15 minutes, I was answered about the following: ‚Äúwe see that the payment was successful.  Report it to Selectel Support. ‚Äù  And they brought some figures that apparently should be important for Selektel.  I sent the message and gave a link to this ticket on the site of the assistant (well, what is not direct evidence?). <br><br>  The answer is the same: wait for Monday. <br><br>  <b>Now it turns</b> out that because of the problems not with me (and therefore it doesn‚Äôt matter who is really guilty, it‚Äôs still on Selectel‚Äôs conscience, since I started paying from their site) I will receive almost a day of machine downtime.  That is the attitude to the client.  I came across similar situations from other hosters, and they were always solved positively.  By the way, I have been a Selectle client for over a year now.  And it all about 350 rubles!  It is very sad that it turns out like this ... <br><br>  Yes, they had failures (and not one).  The support service has always been adequate and provided compensation.  There were no thoughts about the transition ... Now, after such a scam (sorry, I can't say otherwise), these thoughts have appeared. <br><br>  Of course, the loss of one client at 350 rubles a month for them is a grain of sand on the beach.  But we know how it all begins ... <br><br>  Someone will say that I myself am guilty: it is necessary to replenish the balance in advance.  Yes, it is necessary.  But not always it turns out.  But work with clients should always be obtained.  This is the basis of reciprocal loyalty. <br><br>  <b>And once again, why I wrote it</b> : 1) it may affect the solution to my problem;  2) there will be a lesson to other clients of this company, 3) I hope that in Selectel itself something will change in this regard. <br><br>  In the comments it would be interesting to get an assessment of the situation on your part. <br><br>  <b>UPD.</b>  The balance was replenished at 16:20 Moscow time (the payment was at 11:40).  No further information has been received.  Paragraph 2 and 3 remains relevant. <br><br>  <b>UPD 2.</b> Answer to Selectle: Hello.  The problem is solved (Assist gave an error 500 for all requests).  We apologize for any inconvenience caused. <br><br>  <b>UPD 3.</b> Someone threw a post to another blog and therefore it could appear again in your feed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123259/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123259/</a></p>
