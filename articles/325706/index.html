  <section class="page js-page"><h1>5 Tips for Creating Impressive Motion Graphics</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Svetlana Shapovalova, the editor of Netologiya, translated the article by Kara Eberle on how to create spectacular and high-quality animation graphics and what is needed for this. <br><br>  <a href="http://netology.ru/programs/motion-design%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D747%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Motion graphics combine</a> video, audio and text into a solid animated storyline.  Creativity and imagination ensure the uniqueness of each animation, but there are methods that can enhance any of them.  Before unleashing your talent and translating your ideas into graphics, consider the tips that I will give below - they will help you create the most effective and impressive animation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f82/cc9/5d0/f82cc95d0181448a9eb7728e04dc9085.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Imagine the end result </h2><br>  To create a spectacular animation graphics, at the very start you need to imagine the end result.  Until you understand what to do with the animation, it will be difficult to choose the appropriate graphic elements and style.  The first step to creating cool motion graphics is to make sure that you have a complete vision of the desired result.  Although this stage does not require real animation, it is necessary to find out what is needed for quality work. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      To clearly present the result, you will have to answer a series of questions.  For example, you need to find out who your target audience is: the animation for the children's educational project is certainly different from the presentation for the board of directors.  In addition, it is necessary to determine the objectives of the project, its style and other details.  Once you have a clear vision of the project, you will be able to use your skills and bring it to life with the help of available tools and technologies. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_knwNxtzb2A" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i><font color="#808080">Localeur iPhone app available on the App Store - Joah Spearman</font></i> <i><font color="#808080"><br></font></i> <br><h2>  Plan everything in advance </h2><br>  Animation takes a lot of time.  From creating layers in Adobe After Effects to choosing the right visual effects for every detail.  To get the perfect picture, you can sit on one scene for hours.  To put such efforts into the scene, and then realize that it does not fit and needs to be redone - a waste of time and talent can discourage.  It is logical to plan in advance the production of graphics in detail to make the animation process more productive. <br><br>  To make sure your plan is correct, before starting an After Effects animation, do not be lazy to make a storyboard.  It is important to sketch each scene to get a complete picture of the project.  Before you will be the whole movie and you can correct mistakes, improve the scene and make sure that your plan perfectly conveys the essence of the animated message. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d9e/cb4/7af/d9ecb47af9ed4feeb9538601521941f6.jpg"><br><br>  <i><font color="#808080">From the Editor: Do not be lazy to do a storyboard</font></i> <br><br><h2>  Keep the project in order </h2><br>  Animation in After Effects is a complex process.  Since it is built in layers, you need to think about how to organize these layers.  To do this, before starting the animation, you need to make sure that the project is properly organized.  For example, there is a system of layer names, with which it is easy to determine the purpose of each layer.  An organizational structure needs to be created not only for layers, but also for photos and other elements in order to clear the desktop and quickly find the necessary files.  As a result, there will be fewer errors, and the process will go more efficiently.  If you need to send the project to someone else, the recipient will quickly figure out the structure of the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/814/911/8d0/8149118d0f2d4bed99a52a52e8b3f845.gif"><br><br>  <i><font color="#808080">Editorial: Organize your workflow</font></i> <br><br><h2>  Express the key idea clearly </h2><br>  <a href="http://netology.ru/programs/motion-design%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D747%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">Motion graphics</a> usually carry a message.  This is a popular choice for advertising animation, which should quickly interest the viewer in services or goods.  It is also a good choice for educational animation, which clarifies complex concepts in an accessible way.  Animation graphics are also great for visualizing business models, presenting ideas to business partners, or illustrating company goals. <br><br>  Since motion graphics convey important messages, they should be as clear as possible.  When creating an animated movie, you should strive for clarity and simplicity.  Any visual effects, movements, and colors used should contribute to the overall clarity of the work.  So you create an animation that effectively conveys the right message to the target audience. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rcOFV4y5z8c" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i><font color="#808080">Editorial: Nuclear Energy Explained: How does it work?</font></i>  <i><font color="#808080">- Kurzgesagt</font></i> <br><br><h2>  Remember the main objectives of the project </h2><br>  The animation is full of creative possibilities, and there is always a temptation to embellish something.  After Effects contains many visual effects.  However, the effects are not added out of need, but on a whim, distract from the essence of the video.  Unnecessary elements clog the message, but it should remain simple and clear.  In addition, an excess of unnecessary effects violate the appearance of the roller, which should be smooth, solid and attractive. <br><br>  Animated graphics are an exciting opportunity to explain concepts, convey messages, and spread ideas.  When you have a clear vision of the result, a pre-planned and organized project, when you remember the clarity of ideas and goals, you create truly impressive animated graphics. <br><br><h2>  From the Editor </h2><br>  On May 17, we launch the course <a href="http://netology.ru/programs/motion-design%3Futm_source%3Dblog%26utm_medium%3D747%26utm_campaign%3Dhabr">"Motion Design: Graphics in Motion"</a> , where practitioners will learn how to create advertising and presentation videos using motion graphics.
