  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Never work overtime again</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>How much money do you make per hour?</strong> <br>  This is a simple calculation - just divide your salary by the number of working hours. <br>  But we often forget that many of us work more than what is established.  Staying half an hour or an hour later is easy, not to mention the stressful moments before the end of any project. <br>  We work overtime. <br>  And for many of us this time is not compensated by money. <br>  Taking this into account, recalculate your hourly rate.  Have you noticed a drop in your paycheck?  This is because you give your employer some of the work for that. <br>  We must stop doing this.  <strong>Now</strong> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can be one of those lucky ones who get extra money for working overtime.  But even in this case, overtime does not get better.  You understand that life does not consist of one work. <br>  <strong>Why overtime is evil</strong> <br>  My advice (I try to follow it myself) is simple: just refuse to work overtime.  And that's why: <br><ol><li>  When you work overtime, you give away some of your work just like that. </li><li>  If the time to the deadline of your project is too short, but you expect to have time to work overtime, you can be sure that the next project will be allotted just as little time.  If not less. </li><li>  Working overtime dampens you during normal business hours.  You beat the baklushi, because you expect to catch up, working over time.  If you do not consider overtime work as part of every day, you can work on your tasks more efficiently. </li><li>  Working overtime tires you.  And when you are tired, you are more likely to make mistakes, the correction of which you spend all the next morning. </li><li>  Constant fatigue and nonstop work will suck you out without a trace. <br>  Your family and friends would like to see you more often. <br>  In most cases, your boss exaggerates the importance of the deadlines of your project.  Since most software projects fail to meet deadlines, and the industry is still considered successful, I would say that deadlines are not so critical. <br>  In fact, many deadlines that you meet in software projects are not deadlines at all, but rather goals, or, worse, dreams.  Some managers specifically try to make the deadlines as low as possible to put pressure on poor developers.  If you have to work overtime in order to be in time for deadline, then this is not your fault, but this is poor project management. <br>  When working overtime, you put pressure on the rest of your team - they have to do the same. <br>  Working overtime does not make you a hero, although many higher ones try to present it that way. <br></li></ol><br>  <strong>How to avoid working overtime</strong> <br>  Just say <strong>no</strong> . <br>  You need to make a conscious decision overtime not to work anymore.  As long as you deep inside yourself think that hard work makes you a hero, you will not stop.  The first step towards a goal is to memorize a mantra: ‚ÄúOvertime is evil. <br>  When you fully agree with this, you can use the following work: <br><ol><li>  Set an alarm at the end of the working day.  When he rings, go home. </li><li>  Do not perform tasks for others.  Trust others to work independently. </li><li>  Delegate. </li><li>  At work, work.  Do not waste time talking to colleagues. </li><li>  Avoid meetings. </li><li>  First do important tasks.  Thus, if the working day ends before you finish all the planned work, it will not be so critical. </li><li>  Come early.  In the morning, the office is quiet and you can concentrate better.  If you have a door, close it more often to improve the efficiency of your work. </li><li>  Tell everyone that you are no longer working overtime.  Thus, they will not expect your presence after hours. </li><li>  Try to persuade your colleagues to finish at the same time as you (hint: send them a link to this article). </li><li>  Schedule meetings for a while after work.  Thus, if you are asked to work overtime, you can simply say that you cannot be at work because you are waiting for friends. </li></ol><br><br>  If you have any proven ways to avoid working overtime, please share them in the comments! <br>  Remember that the real hero is not the one who sacrifices his life in the name of the company, but the one who cares about his own life entirely and remains fresh and productive without being killed at work. </div>
