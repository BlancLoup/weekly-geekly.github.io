But let's take a look at it from the other side: suppose you want to rent your apartment yourself to guests from other countries through our service.  The issue of safety and security of housing is probably the first one that comes to your mind in this case.  On our website you can find <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/support/article/231%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dairbnb_2">instructions on</a> how to check a future guest, but in this post we want to share with you the personal experience of one of our hosts, the owner of this wonderful apartment in Budapest in the photo: <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/airbnb/blog/251432/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fce/ba7/0c9/fceba70c9e134f4d863ebc1d07550660.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i><a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/rooms/3867764">Olga Kostova reports</a> :</i> <br><br>  I have been traveling with Airbnb for almost 2 years now.  Guests began to take a little more than six months ago.

      During this time, we were visited by 25 guests, which brought us 2100 euros, a lot of pleasure from communicating with interesting people and an excellent opportunity to practice conversational English. <br><br>  We were visiting traveling students from various countries, IT specialists, musicians, a dance teacher, an English teacher, even a political scientist and a historian.  All of them were good people and there was no confusion.  I have a feeling that bad people do not know about the existence of the Airbnb service.  The company has a wonderful marketing that targets only honest, educated and open minded individuals. <br><br>  <b>Some numbers:</b> <br><br>  6 months - 25 guests - 2100 euros. <br><br><ul><li>  8 people from US </li><li>  5 from Germany </li><li>  2 from Canada </li><li>  2 from South Korea </li><li>  2 of UK </li><li>  2 from Ukraine </li><li>  1 Spaniard </li><li>  1 Russian </li><li>  1 french </li><li>  1 Vietnamese </li></ul><br>  By professions: 11 students, 5 programmers, 4 marketers, 2 musicians, 1 dancer, 1 political scientist, 1 historian. <br><br>  I am interested in accepting foreigners.  For example, Koreans tirelessly admire our architecture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afe/298/24c/afe29824c8d6497baaaf31a25e05b1fb.jpg"><br><br>  For them, staying in an Art Nouveau building built at the beginning of the 19th century is something very unusual!  In their country, the most ancient buildings were built in the 60s.  Unfortunately, older architectural works disappeared due to wars.  I do not know if I will ever visit South Korea, but I learned so much about her thanks to the guests! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e26764">But caution is important.</font> </h2><br>  I reflexed - how is it that I am always very lucky with guests, and here is a small checklist: <br><br>  <b>1. Guest photo:</b> no matter what they say about what you should not meet in appearance, but the exterior still speaks of its owner.  Students, programmers and marketers now know a mile away! <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/324/fa3/ae2/324fa3ae23e74438a25095245a8e2eb4.jpg"></div>  <i>How not to accept such a funny girl from the UK or this funny guy from Paris</i> <br><br>  <b>2. Is your profile verified by Airbnb staff?</b>  If the profile is confirmed, it means that Airbnb has all the contact information and even scans of all the pages of his passport. <br><br>  3. Guest profile usually contains reviews from other hosts on past trips, or at least recommendations from his friends.  And if you go to the profile of friends - there certainly will be feedback from the hosts. <br><br>  <b>4. I always read what the user wrote about himself</b> - usually there they indicate the place of study, work, hobbies, interests, etc. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57f/120/4b8/57f1204b87b340a7b7d1199853ac2e70.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3dd/258/a69/3dd258a69ee84eff8d93737e9a6edb33.png"></div><br>  <b>5. It happens that the profile does not have enough information to add up the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa person - then personal correspondence to help.</b>  I never hesitate to ask an exciting question or ask to tell a little more about myself. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af1/67a/fcd/af167afcd439466bb2a439a268da9dc1.png"></div><br>  <b>6. In Airbnb there is an <a href="https://ru.airbnb.com/support/article/59%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dairbnb_2">opportunity to take a pledge</a> for the safety of property.</b>  In this case, not only the amount for housing is blocked on the future guest‚Äôs card, but also the amount you indicated as a deposit.  If everything went well, then this amount will be returned to the guest‚Äôs account, if any complaints, then the amount will go to you, that is, to the host. <br><br>  I do not use this function, as I most often accept students who, most likely, do not have extra money in their accounts.  And also because in my house there is nothing so special, no pieces of art or antiques that could seduce a guest. <br><br>  These are the points I check people for.  Once again I remind you that in the official <a href="https://www.airbnb.ru/support/article/231%3Faf%3D20787839%26c%3Dairbnb_2">rules it is</a> advised to purchase external insurance for an apartment just in case and write the rules for living for guests.  Rules can be hung somewhere on the wall, in a prominent place, and ask not to move the furniture, for example. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#e26764">Not only earnings</font> </h2><br>  For me, the Airbnb service was a great opportunity to meet new people.  Two guys became friends in real life: a marketer from Madrid and a programmer who quit Google from Munich and stayed with us on the way to a new job in an interesting innovative startup in Singapore. <br><br>  Perhaps you have your own checklist, how to determine in advance - will you like the guest?  After all, everyone has their own tastes and preferences.  Share them in the comments to help other Airbnb members receive interesting guests.  I am also very interested. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365613/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365613/</a></p>
