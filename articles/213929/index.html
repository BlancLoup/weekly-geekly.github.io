It does not matter, they were developed by me or found somewhere on the Internet.  Based on the principle that time is the most expensive resource of the system administrator (engineer, architect), a solution was found that meets the following requirements: simple installation, quick setup and, as a sum of previous requirements, quick commissioning. <br><br>  According to the <a href="http://hollandbackup.org/" title="Go to the official site">official website</a> , Holland is an open source backup framework developed by <a href="http://www.rackspace.com/" title="Popular data center">Rackspace</a> and written in Python.  The project aims to create backups with great configuration flexibility, logical structure and ease of use.  Currently, Holland is working with MySQL and PostgreSQL, but in the future it will include a greater variety of databases, and even applications that are not related to databases.  Due to the modular structure, Holland can be used to create backups of anything, anything. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Imagine that our script provides for a daily backup of one MySQL database (using the mysqldump utility) with a rotation of seven copies. <br>  And first you need to download the subject and install it on the server.  In package distributions, this should not cause difficulties.  Also imagine that we have CentOS. <br><br><h2>  Download </h2><br>  Holland exists in <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/holland-backup/">repositories</a> for: <br><ul><li>  Debian 6/7 </li><li>  Centos 5/6 </li><li>  RHEL 4/5/6 </li><li>  Ubuntu 10.04 / 11.10 / 12.04 / 12.10 / 13.04 </li></ul><br>  Also present on <a href="https://github.com/holland-backup/holland/">github.com</a>

      I suppose with this choice there should be no problems with the installation even on the ‚Äúold‚Äù servers.  The package manager of the distribution kit with whom it is necessary to work, will help with this business.  Following the task, we enter into the console, if necessary, adding elevated privileges to ourselves: <br><pre><code class="bash hljs">yum install -y holland holland-mysqldump</code> </pre> <br><br>  The next step, which is logical, will be the setting. <br><br><h2>  Tune </h2><br>  The structure of <i>/ etc / holland</i> is simple and straightforward.  In the directory with the configuration of the program in addition to the configuration file with the main parameters of the work there are two directories: <br>  providers contains templates with settings for working with utilities like <i>mysqldump</i> or <i>xtrabackup</i> <br>  backupsets contain specific backup plans with type parameters: number of copies, method and compression ratio, etc. <br><br>  I found it necessary to provide examples of configurations in an intact form for quick reference by the reader. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">/etc/holland.conf</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">## Root holland config file [holland] ## Paths where holland plugins may be found. ## Can be comma separated plugin_dirs = /usr/share/holland/plugins ## Top level directory where backups are held backup_directory = /var/spool/holland ## List of enabled backup sets.
