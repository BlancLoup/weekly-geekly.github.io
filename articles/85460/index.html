You can ignore, enjoy the beauty of the logical structure, get interested, try for yourself.  Some statements contradict modern scientific theory, as noted in numerous comments, but this cannot be a criterion of fidelity.  We can only express <i>our opinion at the moment regarding this object</i> , and the object will be a subjective model of your consciousness.  Or the opinion of the scientific community, consisting of a collective of subjects. <br><br>  ‚ÄúScience achieves objectivity or approaches it not because individual scientists are not subject to the action of psychological laws that govern all of us, but because the scientific method ‚Äî collective creativity ‚Äî sooner or later surpasses individual prejudices,‚Äù wrote the RAU.

      The questions ‚Äúis this a religion?‚Äù And ‚Äúwhy is this near-science nonsense?‚Äù Do not make sense, they (questions) contain only categories of your consciousness.  For you it can be anything.  But to hear the opinion of another, to share your - comments are always there.  And of course this is my opinion, on this account and at this moment) <br><br>  From all this hodgepodge of subjective faith in the objective one can conclude that under any of our ideas there will be evidence.  Evidence is also our idea. <br><br>  RAU formulated it as: <br>  "Whatever the Thinker thinks, the Prover proves it." <br><br>  And <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580_%25D0%259E%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587">Pelevin</a> wrote about this in <a href="http://lib.rus.ec/b/177715/read">T</a> : <br>  ‚ÄúIn reality, human solutions are developed in such dark corners of the brain where no science can look, and they are made mechanically and unconsciously, as in an industrial robot that measures distances and drills holes.  And what is called a ‚Äúhuman person‚Äù simply puts its stamp on these decisions with the word ‚Äúaffirm‚Äù.  And puts on all without exception. " <br>  Although perhaps not about this, everyone has their own opinion) <br><br>  To study these two Ds, consider an exercise from Robert Wilson: <br><ul><li>  Clearly imagine (visualize) a ruble coin, and then also distinctly imagine how you find it on the street.  Continue to visualize, each time, being on the street.  Find out how much time you spend on finding it. </li><li>  Explain the fact of finding a coin by the theory of ‚Äúselective attention‚Äù - there are a lot of coins, but just paying attention, we begin to notice them.  Find the second coin, armed with this theory. </li><li>  Consider the "mystical" theory - "consciousness controls reality."  Believe that you have materialized a coin in this world.  Find the third coin. </li><li>  Compare the time spent on each coin.  Do not make dogmatic conclusions, &lt;i &lt;believe that you may not know everything yet and can learn something new. </li></ul><br>  One more thing: <br><ul><li>  Convince yourself (if you are not yet convinced) that you are ugly, unattractive and boring.  Go to some party with that confidence.  Observe how people treat you. </li><li>  Convince yourself (if you are not yet convinced) that you are beautiful, irresistible and witty.  Go to some party with that confidence.  Observe how people treat you. </li></ul><br>  Such a belief may seem naive, but many psychological methods are built on this method, for example, <a href="">the submodality method</a> seemed to me a bit extended and well-presented analogue.  (Thanks to <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/combdn/" class="user_link">combdn</a> and <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/sadko/" class="user_link">SADKO</a> for interesting information about this method and not only about it) <br><hr><br>  Let us turn to the contours of consciousness discussed <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/popular_science/85053/">earlier</a> .  Each of them denotes the stage of development of the whole race in the course of evolution, the stage of development of an individual when ‚Äúrepeating‚Äù the course of evolution, the features of programming the behavior of an individual at this stage.  It is possible to mark approximately and simplified the ‚Äúzones of influence‚Äù of each contour on a person‚Äôs ‚Äúbehavior map‚Äù, but it seems to me more simple to go from the opposite and for each example of behavior to indicate its own contour. <br><br>  <b>Contour biovizivaniya</b> .  If the imprint of this contour is negative, that is, the world and surrounding people are imprinted (programmed) as frightening and unfriendly, then a person‚Äôs perception will always adapt to this structure.  Such behavior is unconscious for several reasons: it is programmed at the lowest, basic level and is automatic;  it is programmed up to 3 semantic contours, and therefore non-verbally;  extends to the whole body, not a specific organ.  It is characterized in particular by chronic muscular tension (described in the works of <a href="http://www.koob.ru/reich/">Reich</a> ), which prevents proper, calm breathing, ‚Äúa lump in the throat‚Äù. <br><br>  Reprogramming such chronic anxiety is only possible by working on a body that feels constantly vulnerable and attacked.  Even NLP sessions begin with the fact that the patient is asked to relax and breathe at ease.  If you cannot understand someone‚Äôs ‚Äúirrational‚Äù behavior, start by observing the person‚Äôs breathing and you will very quickly understand what is bothering him. <br><br>  This is important not only psychologically.  Cancer and asthma susceptibility factor is a chronic muscle contraction, which is subjectively manifested as anxiety.  You came up with anxiety - you implemented it.  Even modern "pragmatic" science agrees with the greater predisposition of some people, in comparison with others. <br><br>  What is important for reprogramming is the fact that all mental activity is turned off when biological survival is threatened, until it is solved practically or symbolically.  This one is used in brainwashing, returning consciousness to a state of imprinted vulnerability, by threat.  More on ‚Äúflushing‚Äù a little later. <br><br>  In modern society, money often becomes the object of bio-survival.  The threat of their deprivation - the threat of biological survival.  A low-level program sees no difference and responds equally to a real threat to life and a substituted threat.  Controversial, but in life there are plenty of examples of this. <br><br>  Small break. <br>  Drawing up the next part will again be based on your comments. <br>  <font color="gray">To be continued...</font> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85460/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85460/</a></p>
