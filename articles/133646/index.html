It is much more interesting to look at how Russian large enterprises, in fact - nationally significant, are implementing asset management systems, for what reasons and what, in the end, they get good. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Electricity sector </h4><br>  The optimal use of natural resources is an inexhaustible topic for discussion and work, in this area it is hardly possible to achieve ideal and perfection, but it is definitely worth striving for it.

    <img src="http://www.freeenergyhelp.com/images/sample1.jpg" align="left">  There is such a company in Russia - ‚ÄúJSC Tatenergo‚Äù, which includes almost all the main energy enterprises in Tatarstan.  It also controls the Generation Company, which manages six stations commissioned in the 70s of the last century, and therefore, today, in need of timely repair, modernization or full replacement of equipment. <br><br>  For energy companies, repairs and associated downtime equipment is a single issue, the wrong decision of which can lead to a drop in profits or, in extreme cases, a halt in the supply of electricity to consumers.  Therefore, the solution to the problem of timely repair and maintenance, in fact, is key to the optimization of the work of such enterprises as the Generation Company. <br><br>  The collaboration between IBM and Tatenergo began in 2008, when IBM specialists conducted a pre-project survey of enterprises controlled by enterprises and made recommendations on the implementation of the IBM Maximo platform.  With the help of two IT companies: TatAISenergo and OTR, which acted as a software integrator, the preparation phase was started, during which it was necessary to gather all the valuable information about repairs, equipment replacement and any other data related to repairs and maintenance, in digital form.  At the enterprise, which for decades kept all the data on paper, this turned out to be a truly non-trivial task, on which a lot of time and effort was spent. <br><br>  The work itself was divided into three parts: A. Analysis of system design, on the basis of which the technical task was created;  B. The introduction of basic functionality for accounting equipment, its location, defects, repair, supply of resources and, of course, setting up software and its integration with the Parus management information system already in place at that time.  At the same time, the platform was installed at the facilities of OAO Generation Company. <br><br>  In order to understand how much is a large amount of work, it should be added that it took three years to complete these steps.  During this time, much has been done: information about past repairs and replacements is collected electronically, and for current tasks it is delivered primarily in this (digital) form - this allows you to track certain trends and expect what will happen in the predicted future.  Thanks to these actions, today in the ‚ÄúGeneration Company‚Äù there is a methodology for assessing defects and a complete picture of technological interrelations. <br><br>  In general, the introduction of the Maximo platform in an enterprise of this scale is a unique experience in domestic practice.  Today the system provides the following functionality in full: <br><ul><li>  Equipment Lifecycle Management </li><li>  Repair and maintenance planning, renovation and replacement </li><li>  Order management, incl.  material and technical resources and personnel </li><li>  Management of production warehouses and production personnel </li><li>  Conducting technological schemes of work in accordance with the standards and regulations </li><li>  Presentation of analytical information on the current status of assets </li><li>  Providing a unified system for managing production documents </li></ul><br>  The last, third stage continues to this day and includes the implementation of the rest of the system's functionality: from work planning and integration with other information and analytical systems used in the company to developing KPI indicators capable of dynamically describing the efficiency of the entire system. <br><br>  However, the main stage, namely, the presentation of critical information on the repair and condition of the equipment, is over.  Therefore, today in the ‚ÄúGeneration Company‚Äù they can boast that they keep their finger on the pulse of what is happening in each individual enterprise, since the data from it falls into a single information system. <br><br><h4>  Hydropower </h4><br>  Another positive example from the Russian energy sector is the company RusHydro, which hardly needs to be introduced - it is the only hydro-generating company in Russia and one of the largest in the world, whose combined capacity reaches almost 23 GW. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c92/b33/57f/c92b3357fd3a4e228ecb5e03f013599e.jpg" align="right">  The Maximo platform was implemented at nine sites on the Volga and Kama, in three time zones, and the goal of integration was to increase the company's competitiveness.  In power generation, competitiveness is the reduction of downtime while increasing production volumes.  Parallel factors here are the increase in equipment reliability, its degree of readiness and service life throughout the company. <br><br>  Before Maximo was introduced at the RusHydro facilities, each facility used its own system based on tabular statements, with the help of which the state of the equipment was monitored.  Today, this is probably one of the most outdated accounting systems, sometimes used by large enterprises, and its main problem is that it covers only a small part of the processes.  In addition, this is a paper-based accounting system, which means that historical data are voluminous and are stored in classical archives that are difficult to categorize, organize or compile in any other way. <br><br>  Well, when each of the nine hydroelectric power plants maintains its own, independent inventory of reserves, this leads to the fact that the company, as a single organism, suffers from lack of coherence.  And in RusHydro, almost 25% of inventory units were ordered from suppliers, although they were available at other sites for free.  You can continue for a long time ... <br><br>  As a result, RusHydro asked six integrator companies to show their ideas on how to optimize this process and, after a thorough study of the proposals put forward, chose Bellwood Systems, the integrator, to implement the IBM Maximo platform at nine Volga and Kama HPPs. <br><br>  In addition to improving reliability and availability, as well as equipment service life, the company now has the ability to simultaneously and consistently plan repairs and outfits, which turned out to be painted for <u>years in advance</u> through the use of Maximo software.  At any time, with a couple of clicks, you can get an action plan for the technical maintenance of systems and equipment, which will increase the time between outages and, as a result, reduce the total repair time, along with its cost. <br><br>  With regard to accounting data and key performance indicators - now the chief engineers receive daily automatically generated reports on all non-closed outfits, with a list of possible problems and information on the current status of the process.  No need to go around all the objects - just turn on the computer.  Breakdown response time is now reduced to a minimum, and critical facilities can quickly return to working condition.  In general, RusHydro speaks of a 30% decrease in the volume of outstanding repair work - a good result. <br><br>  The next step is to implement the Maximo platform at all facilities owned by the company - these are 49 power plants throughout Russia. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fd1dc6c3/f42a2076/a87ed2e2/a030821d.png"></div><br><br><h4>  Pipe rolling </h4><br>  We also told about the pipe-rolling shop ‚ÄúHeight 239‚Äù in a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ibm/blog/125394/">separate post</a> , but this unique experience of Maximo implementation doesn‚Äôt turn around. <br><br>  Actually, the potential of the Maximo system in real conditions and its compliance with the requirements put forward by ChTPZ in relation to software products was run on ‚ÄúVysote 239‚Äù.  For IBM and Chelyabinsk Pipe Rolling, this is a positive experience.  Specific figures can be found by clicking on the link, here I will only note that if the products of this level were used in each workshop and plant, then there would be no problem with the repair or critical condition of the equipment. <br><br><h4>  Banking </h4><br>  Delta Bank JSC, together with IBM, has implemented a collateral management system based on the Maximo platform.  The reason why the bank needed a single information system of this level is simple - in 2010, the bank's loan portfolio was significantly expanded by transferring to its accounts some of the accounting assets and liabilities of Ukrprombank LLC.  This includes large loans to enterprises, consumer loans, car loans, and so on. <br><br>  For 35 days, Delta Bank launched a unified information system based on Maximo software, which allows to increase the level of control over the management of collateral and improve discipline in the process of monitoring collateral contracts and their execution. <br><br>  In addition, many business processes of credit services were automated: registration of pledged property, management and control of insurance and pledge contracts, sending out notifications, checking property, managing insured events, closing a pledge, and so on. <br><br>  The main criteria for creating this system for Delta Bank were performance and reliability.  As part of the data was imported from the banking system used at that time, it was important to use modern methods for seamless integration.  IBM Maximo easily integrates with any automated banking systems, including the main system "Delta Bank" ABS B2. <br><br>  By the way, the history of cooperation between Delta Bank and IBM has been around for several years - it all started in 2006, when the bank began using software from the company: Lotus Domino, AIX, Message Broker and TSM. <br><br><h4>  Metallurgy </h4><br><img src="http://img.metalinfo.ru/tmp/9/3/d/93d4334c4ede19eb3a5a07b0d7ddd79f.jpg" align="left">  There is a company in Germany called ‚ÄúSMS SIEMAG‚Äù - it produces equipment for the steel industry and is part of a large SMS GmbH holding.  In particular, the equipment of this company is used at Russian metallurgical facilities. <br><br>  With the help of the EAM Systems integrator (who helped integrate Maximo in the Height 239 workshop), IBM has established a fruitful collaboration with the SMS concern and now IBM software, in particular, the Maximo platform, manages the planning and organization of maintenance work on the continuous casting machine ( Caster) supplied by SMS Siemag.  Thanks to Maximo, it was possible to optimize maintenance and repair, to reduce the frequency and duration of downtime of this expensive equipment, not to mention the reduction of emergency and overtime work. <br><br>  In addition to direct control over the operation of the machine, Maximo software is used for inventory accounting of spare parts and materials for repair, automatically notifying the responsible persons about the need for any work or urgent repairs. <br><br>  Having such a strong partner, like SMS, in IBM‚Äôs client portfolio speaks only about one thing - Maximo is trusted all over the world, regardless of what area of ‚Äã‚Äãoptimization is required - it can be implemented.  At the same time increasing the efficiency indicators and reducing the expenditure item of repair. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/133646/">https://habr.com/ru/post/133646/</a></p>
