      When I was a student, Tatiana's Day was for me almost as pleasant a holiday as the New Year.  Indeed, at this time for many the session ends, you can relax a bit on vacation and take on a new semester with new forces.  And holidays are such a great time for self-education! <br><br>  On this day I would like to share with you one important thought.  People often write to me and ask me: what is the best way to learn how to program, what programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãdo I need to learn?  And I almost always give the same answer: it‚Äôs useless to just learn languages ‚Äã‚Äãfrom various lessons, it‚Äôs better to set yourself some interesting task and start doing it, and everything else ‚Äî including languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are needed for its realization ‚Äî to deal with it. .  As well as a foreign language it is impossible to learn well only from a book, without speaking practice - so a programming language is best studied ‚Äúin the process‚Äù. <br><br>  At the same time it is very important that the task was <b>interesting</b> .  Below, I will tell you a little more about how you can make an interesting learning process in IT (of course, with the help of Microsoft technologies!), As well as about a <i>small gift</i> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Someone was lucky and they managed to find interesting tasks at work.  But more often than not, such tasks can be thought up by oneself - after all, the person himself knows best what is interesting to him.  Therefore, I always urge students to undertake interesting tasks, even if it is not immediately clear why this is necessary.  At a minimum, this will satisfy the interest, and it is likely that a good <a href="http://imaginecup.ru/">Imagine Cup</a> project (by the way, the deadline for submitting applications for this year‚Äôs competition will expire on February 15) or a future startup will grow from such a task. <br><br>  Also an excellent source of interesting tasks are the courses that you study at the university!  As a teacher, I‚Äôll tell you a secret: I‚Äôm very happy if a student comes to me and says that instead of standard laboratory work or a course project, he wants to do something interesting on a relevant topic.  Therefore, very often you can come up with yourself some interesting tasks for the studied subjects! <br><br>  To make it easier to invent, here is a list of interesting Microsoft technologies that can be useful in training: <br><ul><li>  The simplest is the <b>programming course</b> .  Learn how to <a href="http://aka.ms/learncs">program in C # in a fun way</a> in a couple of days, and then, using examples from this course, you can experiment with simple graphics, digital art, or explore mobile application development further (we'll write about this later in a separate article).  Having studied C #, you will be able to create completely different applications on it, from websites to games - in more detail we tell about this in a separate video course " <a href="https://mva.microsoft.com/ru/training-courses/-c--10369%3Fl%3D1gF0xQr6_9604984382">Modern programming in C #</a> ".  Also in a separate article I will tell you how exciting it is to study some aspects of programming using microcontrollers and electronics. <br><br> <a href="http://aka.ms/learncs"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/479/c60/7b2/479c607b2bfc460596a4b03546a59d2c.PNG"></a> <br></li><li>  If you are learning <b>Python programming</b> (this is also a very good idea!), Then notice that Visual Studio has excellent <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/PTVS/">Python Tools for Visual Studio</a> tools that are well described in <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/240581/">this habrastatie</a> . </li><li>  If you are studying <b>artificial intelligence</b> or <b>machine learning courses</b> , pay attention to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/236823/">Azure ML</a> cloud technology.  It will allow you to build a training scheme, train the model on specific data, and then receive predictions ‚Äî all without deep knowledge of machine learning algorithms.  Of the most striking technologies based on machine learning, I would also like to mention <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/263635/">Project Oxford</a> - a set of API for more natural human-machine interaction, which allow, for example, to recognize a person's mood by face, or to communicate in natural language.  Well, for those who are seriously engaged in the subject of training on big data, you should look at the <a href="http://www.dmtk.io/">Distributed Machine Learning Toolkit</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9c/3b6/488/b9c3b64884a443a2a6a9e54e9fba06ff.png"></li><li>  <b>Computer graphics</b> is one of the most fascinating items, as it is very close to building games.  For a more detailed understanding of working with graphics, it's good to understand DirectX - the <a href="http://www.monogame.net/">MonoGame</a> technology is the best for this, in which you can use DirectX primitives directly from C #.  Of course, this technology is suitable not only for games, but also for scientific three-dimensional visualization.  Well, if you don‚Äôt need to understand the details of the algorithms, you can go directly to <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity3D</a> , for which we also have <a href="http://aka.ms/unitybeg">an excellent course</a> . </li><li>  My favorite subject is <b>functional programming</b> , which you can also study (based on the F # language) in a fun way using <a href="http://aka.ms/fsharp">this course</a> .  F # will also be very useful for you when studying various mathematical courses, for example, <b>discrete mathematics</b> , in addition, it is very easy to analyze any data and visualize the result immediately.  There is a <a href="">great free English book</a> on this subject. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/299/4e9/03a/2994e903a7e946b99f87676c59dbd885.png"></li><li>  Various courses on <b>administration</b> , <b>computer networks are</b> very well studied using the example of the Microsoft Azure cloud.  Indeed, in the cloud, you can easily create various infrastructure objects, virtual networks, configure VPN connections between a virtual network in the cloud and your computer, and raise and configure virtual machines.  Unfortunately, these opportunities are not available as part of the <a href="http://studentazure.ru/">student cloud offer</a> , but you can use the 30-day trial period, or the gift I write about below. </li><li>  The cloud can naturally be used in <b>web programming</b> courses, and a <a href="http://studentazure.ru/">free cloud offer is</a> enough to create websites, both static and dynamic.  Just recently, this offer has been expanded with new features, which we will write about during our student week. </li><li>  If you are studying a <b>database</b> course - do not forget that, in addition to traditional relational databases, non-relational repositories, which have received the general name NoSQL, are now becoming increasingly popular.  You can also get acquainted with several such storages in the Microsoft Azure cloud, and you can also deploy and try Microsoft SQL Server there. </li><li>  The cloud can also be used in <b>computational mathematics</b> and <b>numerical methods</b> for conducting high-performance computing on a cluster.  F # and <a href="http://mbrace.io/">{m} brace</a> technology is very well suited for this purpose, although you can use more traditional Hadoop or HDInsight. </li><li>  Whatever subject you study, for sure you often have to write reports that contain mathematical formulas.  If TeX seems to be too cumbersome in terms of syntax, then pay attention to the wonderful Markdown <a href="http://madoko.net/">Madoko</a> document preparation environment.  Being based on TeX, it allows you to get the same quality report, but with a shorter syntax of the original document. </li></ul><br>  We will write a little more about some of these topics during the upcoming week of student articles.  If you know other fascinating Microsoft technologies that can be used in training courses that are usually studied at the university - write me in the comments, it will be very interesting for me to talk about this topic.  I'm sure my list is far from complete! <br><br>  And now - a <b>small gift</b> .  I wrote a lot about the Microsoft Azure cloud above, many of whose features are not available as part of a <a href="http://studentazure.ru/">free student offer</a> .  As a gift, I‚Äôm ready to give out 20 promotional codes for using the Microsoft Azure cloud for a month, which will allow you to use any of the cloud‚Äôs possibilities within a certain amount (about $ 100).  To get such a promotional code, email me on <a href="http://vk.com/shwars">VKontakte a</a> few words about what you would like to try in the cloud - and I will send the code with a reply message. <br><br>  Have a good vacation and interesting activities! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/275869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/275869/</a></p>
