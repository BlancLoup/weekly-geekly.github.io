And the essence is not even in the event itself - programming championships are now enough, and sports programming as a discipline is developing quite actively.  The peculiarity of the RCC is that it is the only ‚Äúcup‚Äù that combines a whole set of conditions that put it, if not on a world level, then close to it.  If you have already read the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/151614/">official report,</a> you can read the ‚Äúguest‚Äù from me. <br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6FIu5IhCcJUuvlQlX6OxqBwXGOzcnYvDA_K1NY0mJ7JEyDxxnEiVHPtYkx7TYcFNASZR4LL-UamUokHIWTeiTslvDDNXXG_2qBlZ5JiAWiz5NSMnGw1Q"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The cup itself took place in several stages: qualifying rounds via the Internet, which can be read <a href="http://russiancodecup.ru/"><u>here</u></a> (or analysis of tasks in Habr√©, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/144793/"><u>part</u></a> 1 / <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/146458/"><u>part</u></a> 2), and, in fact, the Code Cup itself, held, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/128722/"><u>like last time</u></a> , at <a href="http://www.swissotel.com/hotels/moscow/"><u>SwissOtel</u></a> .

      All nonresident contestants were provided with accommodation in the hotel (I did not disclose the details, but, as you understand, SwissOtel is not a dull hostel on the outskirts of Moscow region). <br><br>  Everyone was allowed to use their familiar notebooks with all the software that they have.  Those who did not have laptops were given reference devices with a pre-installed software, which should have been enough to solve any of the problems. <br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/xlu3SuLQCaKDC4VYFQEL5CMqEZjp62Q11ISWBeG-To2NkX0O9K3AL5ul6shUYlsOAJF7dosi01dsVhGtyZx_dBd3fSYAdP09dQkY-BZGgHIvQ7sQPuNc"><br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Hac_oxEbHMUb3kTX1sO7Q6wWLRDPfJLwuzbDqhHFWTyHvls0lKD-VvXG35-f5aUQe8qWenLZM6shmiCwdYqk_9eYVzpZIfwUJhto22wkotu-WPLnLfY"><br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/mdzGigB_xHBtWYXKX3wtAF4DOWGHZHsSfgIAAzm6hL36v0yIUtqXzloMVeFVdWD5uEIzkUTyuebpPzc4Erdl28htXEERy3otFhOSkubZMtaDSCy8Be_s"><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/RKEm-LXnAy7NYSVV3LRUk5V02SAnbgmUXri3Fau97wKOWFNXngDz_Zr-elucgCar0ANMVbBlnN-NJnzHUQwcaIi2ZGA9pgyX8-ajhd8Nmu-L4rpVj6qw"><br><br>  All communication lines (Internet) were reserved three times, ITMO specialists provided the tasks for compiling and automatic checking, and for the most extreme case were prepared Yota modems and routers. <br><br>  In addition to the cup program itself, a cultural program for guests of the event took place in parallel: drinks and snacks in the lounge area (well, this will surprise no one), 3 segways (great thing, it‚Äôs a pity there was not enough room for them), the balls recently mentioned in Habr√© Sphero, which with the help of iPads, had to be carried out along the ‚Äúroute‚Äù in the form of the RCC logo, RC drift cars, drawing with the help of a QR tag on the TV screen, and a harassing lascivious robot who harassed all the guests. <br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-gFqmizgvjU-VTAOthbMgzc2zSZRD4yiT9h59TahbPxz4HbngPmr6nuVAD4DaMDEYHvr3qrHMimgdv9wWpJ6qfqr0_FvP1OlK4ql_mBNaFFaTvPFzbQ"><br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/M0lYwFMukdRdHC6fa23YxpXTAfOkYjqsDsLCwr1oTyOOqkmOwKA_vxQebDHxOo2mbcC_BQF8nEQB1dvi5Q0znvTEKuMx8Zip3sgAmTHARZBp8M4Sy-8"><br><br>  Two round tables were organized, one was held during the RCC final.  At the ‚Äúround table‚Äù devoted to the issues of sports programming, they discussed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating an all-Russian federation of sports programming.  Distinguished guests were invited to the panel discussion on IT education - Minister of Communications and Mass Media Nikolay Nikiforov, rectors Vladimir Vasilyev (NIU ITMO) and Anatoly Alexandrov (Bauman Moscow State Technical University).  Together with the Chairman of the Board of Mail.Ru Group, Dmitry Grishin, he briefly discussed the problem of IT education in Russia, identifying the main problems with each of the stakeholders. <br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/T-tCGb7-RiiyZ-NIJcXWMRFhuwy3YmneMeyzBzWuJIPZTPVJkISXRoMvkE3ZxodFMDmSqgn0roXwoor9EFz28NIVPAXt_JczP9nfjxCsjQ-TSvJnsjoP"><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/zknc5o1j5ptYcRTXwTu8kL4bvNIwMzW7qN94O--IP1Jd9h8E_FPTd1LSAtez7TRtWP6AWoL64EAvdDJFi3-N0WTyReZaZqTpkOIlxaQZMt0KgTBJMbM"><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eWdUZeMyLFk4wPy_QQ2xey_5vyM595ilC4FkKy40f7HHZEdGFWe8voMDDFW7MYgZcSoob-GzOJq4gZpSfUJu_WnELTv70yTpR7NtRrokEBkqyucrBY-H"><br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/qwxv83Xz762PC3qqjby1xLlYHdfcl2OWuPPZ4pBZrcPFWX0HN4cb9Mo3VoHhS0HhKys9pXYEcLR3FlHiwbdy8AqYi3yleRfj0nv95vCaHJx9G8qB9GUV"><br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/44pkRRZHJQvTgS1ZkI1GHNn-31ZAMDbGTP1-XJINW7rydDGwNCg2h2Mx8LyRJtfUNSEDsEwQraNB0PUKkr3J88lpU8eSpaW_TiAZSdaRPtUmvNmGDbIf"><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/C4jo7HZX8wCHoJEfz9dHMjlKRaxg0JFG39BhMf1qeASwUpFumwsduQFrOp7Cb36XBn4j4XI6NKlCOJ3pqpNiXYRBiwt4hDLSaD4GNExsOe7qmd0Vo7mF"><br><br><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/YEr9P6tP8wafGZafzb4MVCJeOVDE4tXJ16U-5X3vMuAUQ3dWfjf-ZCiU_MsFHIy9JH83cR9LNF0YBhIVEH_h6LzI-GII5XDV14ZiY3j9aGwoG2_1kEAn"><br><br><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/qHuZUVHOAfGqTt6ValYxY3n4dNxSnv99wwGpN062_GCz3AwGoVo5dunryp6YcrnLkue0LNDYwYlPVyiTHx2LSwae-0SzwFusraFkmj-xpOhiX5uJrzgB"><br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/DMZOJi5ameZ-9UJLWhnPFHloqava4qWN0XUj-0gqP8WgGWSu-oKdFPIJ7NZMLeihueCoD1b62kQyUqucZ2Iy95hwF7FFBfiXwWBp0EPfSyo62yej1f-X"><br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Fl2dzZw4GD9AO_gazB9Zjtqs1AfyUVER86ixN8-z6QpMdsoLAa6lGynTpnwnaBMRQx6JNKxa5MFJGXHBiCVo3PkreMc6SEktedzf3ZvDsPjQUAPUnTzW"><br><br><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/KoYIVVFWQL-IImcYFMa9Som2SlTI7GeXb0IIesPzf1r751UJf6nGLMmEPe_pnfhb_N3a5xJkSEjdWcrIV9cXBLe_kseDi_6hOa-l-T4twCfux6XNXE0"><br><br><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/phWGOnQFwkK7WYFiTMbU2BtxiWMbC4J97n5TRVm67owNnUm-SiqVWO0xmKjkuTvO5b7sr119lThs9EHOILPYAx0dbTLjo_AxuCFkLMFCUszvDlJjtAM"><br><br>  The award ceremony itself took place directly after the second round table in just a few minutes - at the end of the day another mini-event was planned, which simply could not be moved or moved in time.  Unfortunately, our esteemed minister was late for a full half hour to the round table, which is why both the round table and the award ceremony with the buffet were a bit too tight.  Despite the on-line broadcast of the results, the organizers were able to keep the intrigue right before the cups were handed: the rating of each participant was updated every 30 minutes, and the tasks submitted immediately before the deadline were not reflected in the statistics and their validation was ‚Äúblind‚Äù, no one direct organizers and inspectors did not know the exact results.  And if with the first place everything was clear enough - Vladimir Yepifanov was in the lead with a large margin, then for 2-3-4 places there was a serious battle: the girl claimed the second place, and the results of 2-3-4 places were close, and decided the fate of those very last moments that were kept secret. <br><br>  The event was completed on the ship, and not just a walk along the Moskva River, but a master class on Lego Mindstorms, programming the NeXT microcomputer in C ++.  The Mindstrom sets themselves were received by all 50 (actually 51) participants who made it to the RCC final.  I think it‚Äôs a worthy bonus just because you got to the top 50 programmers who participated in the programming cup of the country. <br><br>  <b>Winners:</b> <br>  1st place - Vladislav Epifanov from Nizhny Novgorod, <br>  2nd place - for the first time the girl took - Natalya Bondarenko, a student at Saratov State University - one of the leaders in training the highest-class programmers.  By the way, this year Natasha seems to have really come with her friend, as promised.  Unlike last year, 2 girls took part in the tournament this year. <br>  3rd place - Egor Kulikov (who took second place last year). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151775/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151775/</a></p>
