      The Kasa autonomous surveillance camera system is designed for use as part of a smart home and is equipped with a hub that adds siren and audio recording features that mimic the presence of people. <br><br>  Virtually every US equipment manufacturer has added a battery to its cameras or a solar battery power feature for battery life. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/43/7b/3g/437b3gscb4d0f58qrxyl0lzifia.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Arlo Ultra camera scares the thieves with a real searchlight.  You can at any time turn on a powerful lamp mounted in the camera body to scare away intruders.  The searchlight also helps to illuminate dark areas of the room, so the camera records color images at night.  Recall that the standard infrared illumination makes the image black and white. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g4/ha/qi/g4haqi_ajtg62scynxs3eawi0uy.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  California startup Deep Sentinel has equipped its futuristic camera with LiveSentinel predictive analytics module.  Watching the activity around the house, the video surveillance system predicts situations that lead to theft, damage to property, penetration into the house.  When a suspicious activity occurs in the security zone, the system automatically sends a notification to the owner or security service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m-/gu/xw/m-guxwpko18pussyigflxng1jsu.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The trend of the year - voice assistants.  Device manufacturers are fighting for the right to be the first to incorporate voice technology into their products.  It is not only about the inclusion of voice assistants in new products, but also about the evolution of the speech recognition technology itself. <br><br>  The Australian company Swann integrated the camera with a voice assistant Google.  Now the basic functions available through the application can be called by voice.  In the near future, we expect further development of this area - the cameras will learn to respond to the voice commands of the user and maintain a conversation. <br><br>  Swann devices make the difference between mail delivery and its theft, pet and person running at night, an authorized user and a stranger.  The smart system itself decides whether to send a push notification in a dangerous situation, or a false alarm. <br><br><h3>  Object Recognition </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ep/_9/es/ep_9esxdrvwmd6molvalq1lkqza.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nortek Security &amp; Control has integrated the face recognition system into the ELAN smart home control panels.  The new touch panel identifies a person as they get closer, and then displays the user options menu, sets the preferred lighting and temperature, turns on your favorite music.  A similar solution was presented by the ADT company - their 7-inch wireless touch control panel is connected to third-party smart things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3e/lu/af/3eluafbt-8lsgenbgxiuefi9g2g.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  A well-known manufacturer of chips for CCTV cameras Ambarella introduced the single-chip system CV2 with built-in support for object recognition technologies.  CV2 cameras are able to recognize people, pets, cars directly on the device.  CV2 provides efficient video encoding in AVC and HEVC formats to minimize cloud storage costs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i-/zk/kf/i-zkkfmmzq94u58m5lqiaqmckbw.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Startup UVeye introduced the technology of detecting security threats by shooting on the camera the bottom of the passing vehicles.  A startup uses several synchronized high-resolution cameras to create a digital 360-degree model.  Three seconds after the vehicle passes the ground-based UVeye device, the system processes the video data to create a 3D model of the chassis with a full-color high-resolution image. <br><br>  The combination of object recognition technologies with the data obtained in the manufacture of vehicles, allows you to compare and track the characteristics of different car models.  The service can recognize a foreign object the size of a USB drive.  In this case, such a system is effectively used to detect leaks, identify wear of parts and any damage. <br><br><h3>  Video surveillance using drones </h3><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XBDxU8aUDWA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In the system of Sunflower Labs, drones with cameras operate in conjunction with high-tech garden lanterns.  A drone, called a "bee", recharges its batteries in a hub or "hive".  Sunflower flashlights with built-in motion and vibration sensors, which, according to the developers, distinguish between people, pets and cars.  When a suspicious activity is detected, the ‚Äúsunflower‚Äù sends a warning, and the user sends a bee to monitor the security zone via a mobile device. <br><br><h3>  Custom solutions </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0d/gz/c5/0dgzc5yj_gyujg5yzgez4nu66vm.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  The more ‚Äúsmart‚Äù things, the more ‚Äúeyes‚Äù are required to control the situation and adaptive behavior.  The Deebot Ozmo 960 robot vacuum cleaner offers all the usual features in its class of devices, but it is also equipped with a camera that helps it detect potentially dangerous objects, and then decide whether to remove them or go around out of harm's way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pb/wq/2h/pbwq2h42zju_1-fnztpbqfth450.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Lenovo introduced a VoIP 360-degree video conferencing camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vm/r2/r5/vmr2r5z4lebktvjoixvrn7ff-ka.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  Cameras got to the fridges and microwaves.  So, Samsung has a built-in fridge touch screen used to order the necessary products, view recipes, display images from the shelves.  And do not need to open the door. <br><br>  How will all the new products be answered by the main camera manufacturers concentrated in China?  We will find out soon.  We cooperate with leading Chinese equipment manufacturers in order to receive design and technical support for joint products as a priority.  Updates are coming and <a href="https://ru.ivideon.com/shop/">with us</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/441988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/441988/</a></p>
