  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to learn how to conduct ICO</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Cryptoeconomics is interesting in that, fundamentally, there is nothing new at all, but what is is completely incomprehensible.  Terra incognita in its purest form.  While walking through cryptomites, we are increasingly convinced that the threshold of requirements for investment projects has fallen with the advent of cryptocurrencies (investors are unqualified), and therefore startups simply have no chance to do business (although money can be raised).  This is a sad conclusion, of course, but let's see what opportunities the cryptostarter has in general to do everything correctly. <a name="habracut"></a></p><br><h4 id="1-sledovat-shablonnoy-metodike">  1. Follow the template procedure </h4><br><p>  The technique is one here, it is <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/guide-to-launching-an-initial-coin-offering-ico-94587af2c8d5">set out</a> in great detail <a href="https://blog.usejournal.com/guide-to-launching-an-initial-coin-offering-ico-94587af2c8d5">and updated by a</a> citizen Chris McCann from the popular venture capital firm Greylock Partners.  You can go through these steps, and you will do everything exactly the same way as the whole world, but if it is not clear, you can go to Russian-language courses, there are a lot of them too (we will not give you any links). </p><br><p>  It would seem a great way.  But what is taught there?  The repetition of the scheme: "site - WP - investor section - legal - media campaign for 2-3 months - profit" (ok, WP and legal have recently changed places).  But Kamon, where does so much English, specialized knowledge, money and friends come from in your head (and wallet) to take and make an interesting <em>product to the</em> <em>whole world</em> ?  Although, stop, for the time being, it‚Äôs not even done, but for a start, <em>bring</em> his idea to the audience and inspire them to vote in crypto-ruling. </p><br><p>  People won pitches for TED for <a href="https://www.prostopreza.ru/blog/91">half a year</a> preparing for the listeners to come up with the idea in 15 minutes, but even after that 100,000 views of their video get a few percent of the speakers.  So it's easier to pitch at TED - they try in front of a live audience, and the crypto project is generally incomprehensible who sits on the other side of the monitor.  Nevertheless, the method with significant probability allows you to collect something there, but in exchange, as a rule, drown your reputation and your team.  The project will be called a "scam", you will leave for a couple of years in the warm seas, investors will write off losses.  And what, also a business experience. </p><br><p>  But what if you have a startup idea that really inspires you to engage in it, build a business?  The innovation ecosystem is currently well developed in Russia. Ta, of course, almost everyone (including investors) is inexperienced, but there is much to do.  At any level of maturity of your project - from the idea to the international expansion - there are those who will help, nudge and speak Russian.  Surprisingly, fundraising in cryptocurrency (more difficult to implement, if anything) seems to start-ups simple and there go those who have not found fiat money. </p><br><p>  Think ICO will help?  Not.  The technique there is inappropriate.  It has two main disadvantages: (1) there is no step-by-step algorithm for embedding a token into the project economy (and a token is money that nobody needs without a market (and participants on it) in principle - we <a href="https://t.me/cryptoeconome/14">wrote</a> about it) and (2) the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe project did not acquire followers because the community was not ripe (3 months of an aggressive media campaign will only attract investors, not participants of your own market).  What does this lead to?  That's right, by the word scam.  If it is not clear, see: the project has collected the target amount (how - by the method due to discounts for coins for investors), then the tokens are listed on the stock exchange and ... they are not traded.  As a rule, coins even fall in price.  Because you have no product, only promises, but for the time being you build it, there is simply no one to trade tokens.  There is no upward interest in money - the so-called.  "active trading positions" (one wants to buy, the other - to sell).  Try to make another mistake in the execution of the development plan of the project or change the composition of the stages in it - the expectations of distant investors sitting in your coins will continue to deteriorate completely and your tokens will try to throw off at any price.  Again we come to the fact that you have lost your reputation (we didn‚Äôt make scams anymore, right?) </p><br><p>  Welcome to the world of equity financing, where your company either creates normal expectations of shareholders, or its shares become trash. </p><br><p>  Ok, the technique is one, the other is not.  But there are also successful projects that have raised money, and their coins are growing.  Then it remains ... </p><br><h4 id="2-zanimatsya-kripto-vuayerizmom">  2. Engage in crypto voyeurism </h4><br><p>  In our opinion, this is the most correct way.  First, there is already visible set of the finished campaign, all the materials.  Secondly, you can "try on" some parts of the documents or tricks on yourself.  Thirdly, enroll in communication channels and ask your support questions.  In principle, to find out how the project is arranged or will be done is real.  There is bad news here: if you are from the same niche as your counterpart, then he is already raising funds, but you are not.  Unfortunately, crypto-money so far is born much less than the top rails of collection from projects.  And when your project enters the market, it will be somewhat more difficult to warm up your investment interest. </p><br><p>  The thought of failing to be second is controversial, but in fact the duplicates are already just a bunch.  For example, we are now engaged in assembling a business model for a single real estate project and are looking at all the well-known ICOs in this topic.  Around July 2017, ideas began to be copied (because they ran out).  See for yourself: </p><br><ul><li>  propy.io, rexmls.com (cross-border real estate trading, international OH, classifier) </li><li>  squarex.io, bitrent.io (construction crowdsourcing) </li><li>  sqpay.io, real.markets (investment in commercial real estate) </li><li>  bloquid.ru (tokens issued as a real estate pledge) </li><li>  relest.io (real estate rental rates auction) </li><li>  realt.uk, atlant.io (AirBnB type p2p rentals) </li><li>  bitproperty.io (distributed REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust - Mortgage Investment Trust) </li><li>  alt.estate, reidao.io (increasing the liquidity of residential real estate sales by splitting into tokens) </li></ul><br><p>  See - already two participants?  Or maybe three, it is necessary to double-check the market ... </p><br><p>  It is clear that to make a competitor in an empty market is not a problem at all - the strongest will survive.  But if they were competitors ... If you look closely, there is a difference between the projects - in implementation, but not in the business model.  We will recently release an article with an analysis of the cryptomemasis "fat protocol", about which so far it is enough to know only one thing: a copy of someone‚Äôs business model in the blockchain is doomed to death.  So like this.  We will be glad to make a mistake, by the way. </p><br><p>  Well, after all, the main drawback of the industrial intelligence method is that no one knows whether this story is viable at all.  Even if it was packed beautifully, but this will only allow to collect the primary funds, but it‚Äôs not at all the fact that the startup will become a business. </p><br><p>  Ok, what to do?  For example, you can ... </p><br><h4 id="3-obratitsya-k-analitikam">  3. Turn to analysts </h4><br><p>  Oh, they are investing, ratings do, all that.  Well, for example, 4 private collections with analytics of crypto projects ( <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JyRRxzZQCt2Sc6D_sUZU7oyPgYDjLUfH_VjjwmXA3Mo/">one</a> , <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qvCCS6lwEH9nOa8KwQGTVhtQ3VXPzed3rXUqksDQkT0/">two</a> , <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OH-AoIggPLL9JGmx7i-Xsjzktc0JCEfLvHvEmDJmeWY/">three</a> , <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vUHwfqpwz1L8QvmBy-PzpcahW40VXg3SbXIY5XqH-IA/">four</a> ), find more, if necessary. </p><br><p>  Of course, such tables for studying are almost useless, because: (1) contain subjective assessments of the authors (which, read - may be erroneous), (2) are made for completely different purposes (choose coins to invest / watch coins in the portfolio) and (3) hardly reveal the reasons for the success of some teams and the failures of others. </p><br><p>  It is clear why.  What is a startup?  This is a project in which a certain group of specialists (= team) has to use machines for construction (= business models) for the production of target value = (product).  Where is the money in brackets?  They are not.  As a result, of course.  If you think about bounty, bitcoin course and St. Tropez, and not about business. </p><br><p>  PS We here thought about this.  And do not arrange us a tape with descriptions of business models, what they are in the world?  There are only 70-80 pieces.  Without longridov, but often.  What do you think? </p></div>
