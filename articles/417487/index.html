It is designed in accordance with the TIER III reliability category in accordance with the TIA-942 standard (N + 1 redundancy with a fault tolerance level of 99.98%), certified in accordance with the requirements of the FSTEC of Russia, and has a unique system of protection against flooding.  Moscow 02 - rented racks in the M9.  <a href="https://habr.com/company/ruvds/blog/412829/">The distributed data center system</a> also includes two foreign sites. <br>  What is the data center M9? <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">From the history of "nine"</font> </h2><br>  The history of MMTS-9, the largest technological platform in Moscow for interaction between Russian and international telecom operators, has more than two decades.  Back in 1995, the main Moscow providers created on the basis of Moscow Intercity Telephone Station No. 9, the main shareholder of which a year earlier was Rostelecom, a point of mutual exchange of IP traffic.  The equipment of the main Internet providers was placed there, there were international and long-distance communication channels. <br><br>  The providers wanted to exchange their traffic with each other directly, optimizing the routes of its passage, which significantly reduced the data transfer time and the loading of expensive international communication channels.  The coordination of MSK-IX was entrusted to the Russian Research Institute for the Development of Public Networks (RosNIIROS). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2bf/232/49e/2bf23249e58cba416c95a8e6f241639a.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Today, MMTS-9 is the largest peering point in Russia, with more than 500 telecommunication companies among its clients.</font></i> <br><br>  Despite the solid history created on the basis of MMTS-9, the data center M9 has quite modern technical equipment, including engineering infrastructure, a structured cable system (FO / UTP5 / UTP6 connecting lines in the hall and according to MMTS-9), uninterruptible power supply systems, climate systems, gas extinguishing systems, monitoring and video surveillance. <br><br>  In 2002, the ‚Äútelecommunication‚Äù modernization of the MSK-IX was carried out.  The site became distributed by combining 10 points connected by a fiber-optic cable (Gigabit Ethernet).  In 2013, the technological areas of MMTS-9 were updated and modernized.  The machine hall has become a full-fledged data center with a high level of reliability.  By 2015, the data center area for 1,500 racks (up to 47U, 600x1070 mm) was 6900 sq. M.  m, the supplied electric power - 6.5 MW. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db0/42c/b60/db042cb6040a1af9e641ad305b991e83.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Currently, the M9 is one of the largest neutral sites in Moscow with equipment of a high level of complexity.</font></i> <br><br>  The station building houses telecommunication equipment with a power consumption of 5.5-6 kW per rack, however there are also high-loaded racks with power consumption up to 24 kW.  Leasing space in the data center customers are given the opportunity to create an individual tight area. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b7/af5/2cb/1b7af52cbc26af04f14b14a80746387d.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">After bringing in additional electric capacities of 8.8 MW, the power supply of MMTS-9 reached 15.3 MW.</font></i> <br><br>  A unified control room has been created, which collects information on the operation of all data center systems for monitoring the operation of network and IT equipment, uninterrupted power supply systems, cooling, air conditioning, fire fighting, security and access control. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/630/50e/d98/63050ed98f17b05977ebcfbb74cc9354.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Energy consumption of high-loaded racks reaches 24 kW.</font></i> <br><br>  Today, the Moscow Internet Exchange is a reliable, distributed system that includes ten equal points, connected by a high-speed backbone.  Thanks to the MSK-IX distributed structure, the connectivity of providers to the IP traffic exchange system and high-speed transit between the MSK-IX nodes is significantly expanded.  Creating a data center in a place like MMTS-9 allowed us to ensure the simplicity and convenience of interaction between operators and other owners of Internet networks. <br><br>  M9 partners and customers are the largest companies, including MTS, VimpelCom, Megafon, TTK, Orange Business Services, and others. The site provides a platform for exchanging IP traffic between networks and a distributed network of DNS servers to support root-domain zones.  Telecom operators, social networks, search engines, video portals, providers of cloud services, corporate and scientific and educational networks are connected to it.  Most of the telecommunication channels that connect Russia to the world go through the M9; more than 80% of the Russian Internet is connected to the site. <br><br>  Specifications MMTS-9 (M9): <br><br><ul><li>  Total building area - 40,938 m¬≤ </li><li>  The area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe adjacent territory is 12,500 m¬≤ </li><li>  Machine room area - 7 684 m¬≤ </li><li>  11 machine rooms with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã20,744 m¬≤ </li><li>  The total number of counters put into operation is 1,736. </li><li>  The number of racks placed / rented by customers is 1,428. </li><li>  Dimensions of server racks - 800x600x42U, 600x1000x47U </li><li>  Power supply from 4 independent power inputs </li><li>  Power supply - 15.3 MW with redundancy </li><li>  Power of cooling systems - 8 MW with redundancy </li><li>  Fire extinguishing gases CHLODON and 3MNOVEC </li><li>  Security perimeter and premises 24/7/365 </li><li>  Access Control System </li><li>  CCTV </li><li>  24-hour life support staff </li><li>  More than 500 telecom operators are present at the site. </li><li>  Telecommunications Equipment - Cisco Systems and Juniper Networks </li><li>  Channel capacity is more than 150 Gbit / s </li><li>  All technological rooms M9 are protected by automatic central or modular gas extinguishing installations </li><li>  Service availability - 99.982% </li></ul><br>  In order to get closer to this famous site, we conclude with a short tour of the M9 data center. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Excursion to the data center</font> </h2><br>  The building of the station M9 is equipped with all the standards of engineering infrastructure.
