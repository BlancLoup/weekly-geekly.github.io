  <section class="page js-page"><h1>My minimum set of applications for Android</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Once I was driving from work last week, I was sitting in the internet from my mobile phone, and I realized that enough was enough - it‚Äôs time to buy a communicator.  Especially they have never been interested and not fond of.  In general, nothing special, and did not know.  I went to the first store and bought HTC Hero.  Many then scolded me, of course, why did Hero take it, I had to take Legend or Desire, and so on, but since it was my first communicator, I had something to do with the Hero and play around. <br>  Here I want to publish my set of programs that now stand on my HTC.  I tried many different ones, and here are the ones that I liked from those presented in different categories. <br>  1. Since I surf a lot via gprs, then <b>3G Watchdog</b> .  The program to control Internet traffic, it is possible to set a limit on traffic for a certain period of time, when approaching which, the program will issue a warning.  There are widgets. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  2. To monitor the running processes now using the <b>Advanced Task Killer</b> , I do not really like this program.  I would be very happy if you advise something better. <br>  3. I liked the <b>Aldiko</b> application for reading and downloading books.  Nice interface in the form of a bookshelf, it is convenient to find books in various categories.  In general, a pleasant and convenient reader.  True, I don‚Äôt know if there are any books in Russian, as I read English. <br>  4. Naturally, I installed <b>appInstaller</b> - to install applications downloaded in advance from an SD card, again it‚Äôs convenient when there is no WI-FI on hand and I save traffic. <br>  5. <b>arcMedia</b> - to watch the video - as long as all the formats that I downloaded onto my SD card - were successfully opened.  This is flv, mp4. <br>  6. <b>Camera 360 Pro</b> - for snapshots of photos with various effects - there are many comic effects, for example, made a snapshot, and there is a ghost on it.  An interesting program, you can play. <br>  7. <b>vRecoder</b> - record phone calls.  Records well and me and the interlocutor.  You can configure which numbers to exclude from the recording, after what time no conversations should be recorded. <br>  8. I use Twitter client - <b>Twidroid</b> is convenient and easy. <br>  9. <b>Md Music</b> - audio player, while temporarily set.  I would also like your advice - which one is more convenient to find out? <br>  10. The first day after buying the phone I almost didn‚Äôt sleep, because while I was playing with it, the sound level accidentally dropped to zero, in order to get rid of the accidental sound change, I found such a program - <b>Volume Locker</b> . <br>  11. With toys for android somehow I have no luck at all, that I will install, it is not very interesting.  I was looking for something from quests and casual games, or a good strategy.  And I would like something like Heroes on android. <br>  As a result, I have stopped at such <br>  - <b>Puzzle Blox Arcade</b> helps to kill time - destruction of nearby single-color cubes. <br>  - <b>Little Shop Traveler</b> is a beautiful toy, we travel around cities.  In each city, just looking for items in the picture. <br>  - <b>Brain Challenge</b> - really liked this toy, a workout for the mind.  At the same time, she first launched - did not like it, thought oh, how easy it was, then more and more new tasks and levels began to appear, and got involved.  Various mathematical and logic problems. <br><br>  Here is a review I did for 3 days. Now I am looking for a good file manager, a manager of running processes, and an audio file player.  I will be glad to any advice and recommendations.  Plus, is it really so bad with Android toys?  Or I did not find? <br><br>  <b>And I would like to hear your minimum set of applications on Android in the comments.</b>

      Shl.  Now I use this file manager - <b>ESManager</b> Thank you. <br><br>  2.  A few days later I will correct the article according to the comments.  And I will make a set most often by all used applications. <br><br>  ZY3.
