  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Buying mp3 music online</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good time of day. <br>  I want to tell you about the experience of buying music in mp3 format through domestic online stores. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We all have been watching the major label war (which is represented by <a href="http://www.riaa.com/">RIAA</a> , <a href="http://www.ifpi.org/">IFPI</a> , <a href="http://www.bpi.co.uk/">BPI</a> , etc) against piracy (which is <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7">presented by</a> portals, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">bittorrent</a> trackers and most people :)) for a long time.  The main reason for the war is the inability to make super-profits by selling a large number of discs of a popular artist. <br>  In my opinion the main reasons for the fall in sales of disks: <br><ul><li>  easier to download from the Internet than go to the store for a disk; </li><li>  The consultants in the stores are sometimes not very well versed in music; </li><li>  it is almost impossible to find a disc of a slightly popular artist for sale; </li><li>  it is also impossible to find a sale of a foreign performer‚Äôs disc that does not have a representative label in your country; </li><li>  your option ... </li></ul><br>  At the same time, the warez sites / trackers provide truly unlimited possibilities for music lovers: <br><ul><li>  search that takes seconds; </li><li>  huge collections of records.  starting from yesterday's album of a mediocre pop group, ending with ultra rare recordings; </li><li>  search for similar artists, recommendations in the comments; </li><li>  downloading an album in mp3 takes about 15 minutes on a modern connection. </li></ul><br>  Why not make a portal with similar opportunities only for the sale of music?  I began to search online mp3 shops in runet.  The announcement of one of the shops I saw in <a href="http://www.fidel.ru/">Habr√©</a> ( <a href="http://www.fidel.ru/">fidel.ru</a> ).  The second was found by me through a search engine ( <a href="http://soundkey.ru/">soundkey.ru</a> ). <br>  It should be noted that the search for a legal online mp3 store is not a trivial matter.  Because there is no way to check the legality of the store.  Illegal shops are not much different from legal ones.  Take a look at recs.ru Quite an adequate site.  Without annoying ads and popups.  And if you still let the highway to him and see at the end of the path <a href="http://www.riaa.ru/">www.riaa.ru</a> [87.249.28.29], then there is no doubt - a legal store!  :) But this is not true.  The site sells music that is released on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warez_scene">"stage"</a> .  But now is not about that. <br><br><h3>  So 1st shop - <a href="http://www.fidel.ru/">fidel.ru</a> </h3><br>  Open up.  It seemed to me that the site is very heavy and overloaded.  Loaded for a long time, and a rich flash is very difficult.  We are trying to find something interesting for us to buy.  Open the music section.  We see filters by popularity, date, artist and album.  But there is no way to choose releases of a certain label, which I consider to be a significant disadvantage.  For the purchase, I chose "the largest prime number." <br>  We replenish the account.  Pleases a large selection of options to replenish the account.  Then you and VISA / MasterCard, and SMS, and WebMoney, and Yandex.Money, and Sberbank.  In general, full stuffing.  I chose to replenish my account with the help of a VISA card, since I had it (Euro VISA Virtuon, which is not available in plastic and was opened by me specifically for connecting to PayPal and payments on the Internet).  With the visa there is a choice of two payment systems: payment.ru and Assist.  The payment was made and, I was very pleased, the money came to my account at the store within minutes. <br>  I paid for my order ‚ÄúThe Biggest Simple Number - The Biggest is Just the Number 2007‚Äù.  A link appeared in the download section of the account.  You can only download the entire album immediately packed in zip.  Principle I do not see this as a disadvantage.  Download, unpack.  We open and see that the seller did not even bother to put down the tags. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2f6/bfd/90c/2f6bfd90c3d209f2809be8422ead6617.png"><br>  I find this unacceptable for paid content.  In general, the impression of the store begins to deteriorate.  And then I, as a fan of your favorite band, notice that one track is missing.  Really.  It is not listed on the site, and it is not in my downloaded archive.  At the same time, this track (Istanbul) is listed on ozone in the information on the disk <a href="http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3325844/">http://www.ozon.ru/context/detail/id/3325844/</a> , it can also be found in rips on wares portals and torrents, as well as in another mp3 store <a href="http://soundkey.ru/album/1468/">http://soundkey.ru/album/1468/</a> .  Where did one track for me remain a mystery.  It is worth noting that I bought the album of another group, in which were all the tracks and tags. <br><br>  One of the advantages of the store is the quick transfer of money to the account.  Also, as far as I understand, if something happens to my hard drive and I lose the files, I will be able to transfer the purchased releases in the future. <br>  Cons: heavy flush overloaded design and uncomfortable interface.

    <h3>  2nd store - <a href="http://soundkey.ru/">soundkey.ru</a> </h3><br>  The store is much faster than its competitor above.  You can also filter albums by date, popularity.  Choose genres.  But, which was nice for me, you can choose a label and see only its releases in the store.  Found recently released debut album of an interesting group.  Added to cart.  To replenish the account there are also many different ways.  I chose VISA.  Payment posting seemed strange to me.  First, I go to the website softkey.ru, through which I buy a soundkey refill, and from there I pay for this service through a cyberplat system.  I was upset that the money went in, in contrast to Fidel already a day later.  What is the principle stated ‚ÄúReplenishment of the Soundkey account Delivery time - from 1 day to 1 day‚Äù.  Not critical, but even so.  You can download the purchased album within five days after the purchase.  Moreover, in contrast to fidel, you can download only by the day.  A fully packed album cannot be downloaded.  I would not say that this is a flaw, I just clarify.  Started to download the long-awaited album.  After listening to several themes, I noticed that they do not end with a logical end, but are interrupted somewhere in the middle, and one topic was generally ten seconds long instead of several minutes.  Hmm ... - I thought.  Reloading different managers and browsers did not give anything.  Climbing on an Internet, I found a list of tracks with playing time.  On the album page in the store, cut-off time was indicated.  Without thinking twice, I sent a letter to the support, where I explained everything in detail.  The answer came in a day, that there is a problem and it will be solved soon.  A day later, a letter arrived that everything was fixed.  And the long-awaited album was downloaded.  Three days to buy an album in the online store - severely.  :) But the frustration is not over.  With tags it was even worse than on fidel: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3a/78c/415/d3a78c4157c2ba86225fff3c05a01e3b.png"><br>  A depressing sight.  It is worth noting that I have bought two more releases.  In one of the albums (he also 2009go) with tags was the same problem.  In the other (2007 year) with tags everything was fine.  But one of the tracks was compressed by an encoder, different from the others.  Why and why it remains a mystery to me: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e17/829/15b/e1782915b4f83102951d2835a0e4d5a9.png"><br><br>  Advantages of the store: a simpler and easier interface, the ability to view releases by labels, subjectively better represented domestic content. <br>  Cons: subjectively sophisticated payment via software through cyberplat;  day money transfer and day answer support. <br><br><h3>  Findings. </h3><br>  I want to take stock of my purchases.  It seems to me that the sales area of ‚Äã‚Äãmp3 is in some kind of incomprehensible suspended animation.  The variety of presentation of content is simply amazing - different codecs (even within the same album), crooked tags, albums with missing and incomplete tracks.  I suspect that the problem of low-quality content hangs not on stores, but directly on the labels that provide the content.  But here I am not sure.  One thing I can say for sure - I don‚Äôt want to pay money for such quality goods. <br>  I also could not find a decent Ukrainian store mp3.  Yes, and with Russian is not easy.  It is quite problematic to distinguish a legal store from an illegal one.  And I am a technically savvy person.  When we buy CDs in the store, we see good printing, holograms.  They give us a check.  We see what we buy and from whom.  When we buy mp3, we do not have the means to check the legality of the store.  Perhaps the labels or their affiliates would be worth issuing a certificate to stores or maintain a database of stores available on label sites. <br><br>  The pirate portal recs.ru earns (read it steals) huge money, and its owner basks in Sydney.  And labels continue to cry that there are no sales and no one buys anything. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/73995/">https://habr.com/ru/post/73995/</a></p>
