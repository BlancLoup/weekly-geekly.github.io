Snowden was able to interest the Hong Kong edition of the South China Morning Post with a statement that American intelligence services have been hacking Chinese computers since 2009.  At the request of the newsmaker, the newspaper will not disclose how the interview was conducted. <br><br>  Edward, in particular, said that the NSA had performed more than 61 thousand computer hacking operations around the world, of which hundreds were targeted at facilities in China.  Among the targets in Hong Kong were the Chinese University of Hong Kong, officials, enterprises and students of the city: ‚ÄúWe crack the backbone network nodes (in fact, huge Internet routers), which gives us access to the communications of hundreds of thousands of computers without having to break each of them.‚Äù <br><br>  Snowden said that he wanted to demonstrate the hypocrisy of the US government, which claims that, unlike its enemies, they are only protected, and that civilian infrastructure is not their goal.  He believes that they will use any means to non-proliferate this information, including diplomatic intimidation. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The editors of ArsTechnica recently <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/06/nsa-leaker-ed-snowdens-life-on-ars-technica/">conducted a</a> small investigation and found that Snowden could have an account on the site‚Äôs forum.  TheTrueHOOHA account was registered in 2001, when Edward was 17. His <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D10%26t%3D886365%26p%3D16404424">first forum discussion was</a> about setting up a web server on his own home computer.  The last post on the forums dates back to May of last year.

      Very much <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/ellievhall/edward-snowdens-online-past-revealed">indicates</a> that the account belonged to Edward: this is the same age (in 2006, the user TheTrueHOOHA <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D6791072">mentions</a> that he is 22), as well as the account owner, like Edward, <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D6352598">did not finish</a> high school, but works in the field of information technology;  Finally, TheTrueHOOHA <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D6489308">says</a> that it works for government structures in the field of IT. <br><br>  About Edward, you can learn a lot about this forum account, including <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D5856884">problems on the personal front</a> .  Snowden is a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D24%26t%3D636292%26p%3D12040667%26hilit%3Dpeter">Buddhist agnostic</a> , a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D11746383">supporter of Internet anonymity</a> , animeshnik, a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D11565106">gamer</a> , an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D12629788">ardent Tekken fan</a> , an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D971426">owner of a semi-automatic Walther P22 pistol,</a> and an <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D6816291">airsoft player</a> . <br><br>  In 2006, he <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D6468049">mentions</a> that his priority of moving to other countries is as follows: Japan, Thailand, Korea, China, Australia (as can be seen, he liked Asia then too).  In the Ground Forces, the future exposer of the dark affairs of the NSA <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D23%26t%3D308196%26p%3D6751983">broke</a> both legs.  He is <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D1862943">interested in</a> running a safe and anonymous operating system from a CD in 2009.  In 2010, he <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D503777">speaks out</a> against surveillance at the state level.  <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D23%26t%3D278042%26p%3D6318233">He</a> does <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D23%26t%3D278042%26p%3D6318233">n‚Äôt like</a> American record companies either. <br><br>  Bonuses work on state structures he <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Fp%3D6489308">likes</a> .  By the way, the day before yesterday Snowden was finally <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2013/06/11/news/companies/snowden-booz-allen/index.html%3Fhpt%3Dhp_t2">fired</a> .  Trying to make a more vicious attack on him, the former employer published his salary: it was 122 thousand dollars, not 200, as <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/182698/">stated</a> earlier.  The vacancy of the junior system administrator in Booz Allen is open. <br><br>  Although Snowden had plans to seek political asylum in Iceland, in an interview with the South China Morning Post, he stated that he plans to stay in Hong Kong because he does not hide from justice, but reveals the truth about the crimes, and he has nothing to fear.  Edward did not respond to the offer of asylum by the Russian side, only expressing joy that there are states in the world that cannot be intimidated.  The British Guardian, from which it all began, declares that they still have unpublished material from Snowden. <br><br>  Photo by TheTrueHOOHA from <a href="http://arstechnica.com/civis/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D23%26t%3D311697">ArsTechnica Forum</a> (2006). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/183234/">https://habr.com/ru/post/183234/</a></p>
