  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Greed?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Many, even the famous igrodely and publishers do not disdain in the open and brazenly earn money on gamers.  And it's not about the drives themselves with the desired game, for the licensed versions of which, finally, in our area it has become popular to pay with a full-fledged coin.  Additional content - pay.  Addon - pay.  And all right, everything would be like, say, Witcher, whose <a href="http://www.ag.ru/games/witcher_enhanced_edition">augmented edition</a> was really done with a bang.  And license holders can download it for free.  Sometimes we are shoved <a href="http://www.ag.ru/games/crysis_warhead">crafts</a> for the price tag of the original. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I really didn‚Äôt expect anyone from Blizzard.  These comrades usually know what they are doing.  Without exception, their games are mega-hits.  Prices (take a look at World of Warcraft) also do not bite.  But what Blizzard plans to do with the fresh, almost ready-to-go StarCraft 2, many fans of this RTS and simply those who are not indifferent to it ‚Äúhave somewhat upset‚Äù. <br><br>  So, at the BlizzCon 2008 festival, Blizzard representatives said that the StarCraft 2 strategy is too ambitious.  Therefore, "in an effort to preserve the quality and acceptable release dates, Blizzard decided to divide the game into three parts."  For a start, we will be offered to buy Terrans: Wings of Liberty, where there will only be an official campaign for earthlings.  Two more compacts will be on sale later.  From Zerg: Heart of the Swarm and Protoss: Legacy of the Void.  They will contain not only campaigns for the respective races, but also a whole heap of innovations.  Such as new units, abilities of races and other chips.  Well at least an online game for all races will be available immediately, starting with Terrans: Wings of Liberty. <br><br>  Many users, whose <a href="http://www.igromania.ru/GameNews/22453/StarCraft_2_edinyi_v_treh_licah.htm">opinion</a> I read on popular forms, believe that the legs of such a Blizzard solution are clearly growing from Activision.  The people refuse to believe in ‚Äúexcuse‚Äù on account of the unavailability of the game and the possible disruption of the release dates, because someone is already someone, and Blizzard can afford (and constantly allow) to twist and turn the terms as you please.  To the very fact that there is no complete ‚Äúlicking‚Äù, ‚Äúcombing‚Äù and other actions with the engine, code, design, balance and other components of their hits.

      If it is quite rude, then Blizzard is trying to push one game for the fans for the price of three.  Of course, I myself first apologize for writing here if parts with companies for Zerg and Protoss will be available for free as updates.  But while in the new policy of a respected company, greed slips exclusively.  Hope borrowed. <br><br>  UPD: I certainly hope that it's not about greed.  And what really does not have time and that all three parts can, in terms of scale and quality of performance (still not someone, but Blizzard), pass for independent games.  But it came to my mind that Blizzard seems to be almost the only company that can afford such a ‚Äúthree meals a day‚Äù.  Any other (well, maybe more than Valve Software) would have been stumbled right away. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42336/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42336/</a></p>
