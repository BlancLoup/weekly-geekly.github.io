  <section class="page js-page"><h1>bb-mobile micrON-4: headset with the form of a phone with support for SMS and notifications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/220533/">In this post,</a> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alexeystar/" class="user_link">alexeystar</a> talked about his impressions of the Samsung Galaxy S5, in parallel comparing it with the Galaxy S4.  I was also fortunate enough to hold in the hands of both the S4 and S5, so I can agree with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/alexeystar/" class="user_link">alexeystar</a> that the increased size is the main drawback of SGS5.  Either I am so sensitive by nature, or just ‚Äútightly‚Äù got used to the size of SGS4, but ... It‚Äôs not very convenient for me to hold the ‚Äúfive‚Äù at my ear while talking.  That is, you can live, ‚Äúa person becomes accustomed to everything,‚Äù and so on and so forth, and yet I had to get the Motorola Finiti Bluetooh headset from the bins.  An excellent headset, by the way, but only [in my case] is very old.  And, as a result, with a half-dead battery - 2 years lying on the shelf (with periodic recharging, of course), the latter, unfortunately, could not stand it. <br><br>  In general, after tormenting a couple of days, I took the bb-mobile micrON-4 for a test - this opportunity appeared just in time, since Motorola Finiti completely passed and began to discharge once an hour and a half or two.  Anyway, during these two days I once again came to the conclusion that I really didn‚Äôt like to wear a headset on my ear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3e6/194/980/3e61949800acc681d780974cd2eb6069.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have already done a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/198570/">post about bb-mobile micrON-3</a> , but, in truth, micrON-4 is the heir to micrON-2.  Because the "troika" did not have a keyboard and screen, being executed in the "plastic card" form factor.  But the ‚Äútwo‚Äù and ‚Äúfour‚Äù - this is a Bluetooth headset in the form of small phones.  I emphasize that they do not know how to call by themselves, they need some kind of head unit.  But in conjunction with it, they turn into "full-fledged" phones.  I will say more: in conjunction with a micrON-4, a smartphone or tablet is rarely needed to get out of your pocket.  (But only with Android devices: the hero of this review can also be connected to the iPhone, but in this case, all additional functions are not available, in fact, only calls remain.)

      However, let's order.  <b>Packaging</b> bb-mobile micrON looks like this.  The package includes a lanyard for carrying on it, a USB-microUSB cable and instructions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f7e/0b1/cb2/f7e0b1cb283b3b840f8eda83ef7c1b13.jpg"><br><br>  The headset, as mentioned above, resembles a small phone.  Very, very small - here is bb-mobile micrON-4 next to the Nokia 105, which is also small. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/565/9cc/784/5659cc7849e12ace9188b9cab3fe41b6.jpg"><br><br>  If a 1.1-inch monochrome OLED- <b>screen was</b> used in bb-mobile micrON-2, then in bb-mobile micrON-4 it became colored and got a diagonal of 1.4 inches.  The technology has changed to TFT, but in my opinion, it has never become worse.  The picture fades in the sun, but, nevertheless, it is quite possible to understand what is displayed on the display.  The main thing is to look at the screen at a right angle, but when viewed from the side, the image is inverted. <br><br>  <b>The case</b> of bb-mobile micrON-4 is of high quality - this also applies to materials and assembly.  Silver inserts, of course, plastic with the color "under the chrome", but scratches and chips on them do not appear.  In any case, I wore a headset in my pocket and didn‚Äôt follow the accuracy of its operation.  Two weeks later, she looks like new. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/557/b82/767/557b827677d01deea1fc8b57932ae931.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/382/6f2/ae2/3826f2ae27aef0827f6a5352812e693e.jpg"><br><br>  The size of the bb-mobile micrON-4 is smaller than that of the "two": 92 x 35 x 8.7 mm instead of 104 x 38 x 12 mm.  The headset weighs 44 g, that is, it is three times lighter than the average 4-inch smartphone. <br><br>  <b>To control the headset, there are</b> two soft buttons, "red" and "green" handset, buttons "up" and "down".  The key with a note in the menu opens items (that is, it actually duplicates the left soft button), and on the desktop it is responsible for activating the music management interface ‚Äî if the head unit plays tracks.  The fact is that the micrON-4 can act as a stereo Bluetooth headset.  On the case of "micron" there is a standard 3.5-mm jack, so that you can connect almost any headphones to it.  Switching tracks and pause is carried out using the buttons 1, 2 and 3 on the keyboard. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d9/3da/a9e/1d93daa9edea458dc63493c680efc1d8.jpg"><br><br>  The keyboard, by the way, is average in convenience.  It is made in the form of a plate, so that the buttons are pressed tight and have a short stroke.  You can get used to it, I got it here. <br><br>  <b>At the time of the incoming call,</b> bb-mobile micrON-4 loses the melody sewn into its memory, which is not too loud, quiet and in general only one.  This is a minus.  On the other hand, the head unit - a tablet or a smartphone - will also play a ringtone from a bag / pocket, so it is unlikely to miss the call.  There are four notification modes for a call to bb-mobile micrON-4: ‚Äúsound‚Äù, ‚Äúvibration‚Äù, ‚Äúsound + vibration‚Äù, ‚Äúno sound‚Äù. <br><br>  When you first connect to a smartphone or tablet, bb-mobile micrON-4 downloads the phonebook from it.  You can search for contacts in it from the keyboard - both Latin and Cyrillic are supported.  The problem is that the contacts are displayed all in a row - and with phones, and without them.  In short, all that is in the head unit.  I have indicated that the smartphone does not display contacts without phone numbers, and in micrON-4, those cards that do not have a number are displayed, but only a postal address.  The result is a slight confusion, since the contacts in the headset are much larger than in the smartphone.  And most of them can not be called.  I can not say that this is a very serious joint. <br><br>  <i><b>Unlike the previous bb-mobile headsets of the micrON series, the Quartet can work with messages and even display notifications from applications.</b></i>  This is a truly unique feature that personally allows me to rarely get a smartphone out of your pocket.  In order for all of the above to work, you need to install a special program BTNotification (you can download it from the official bb-mobile website - there is a link in the manual), and then activate it in the settings of your smartphone or tablet computer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3c/8cb/be6/a3c8cbbe65f81b4f7e14c4324350d009.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7a1/10e/bd9/7a110ebd9c34fa2f4a49520e176e1932.png"><br><br>  What does this give?  All your SMS appear in bb-mobile micrON-4 - that is, the messages that already exist in the head unit.  New - too.  They can be read on the screen of the headset, as well as respond to them using the alphanumeric keyboard.  In the case of a smartphone, this may not be very justified.  But if we are talking about the tablet, which lies in the bag and that really do not want to get, then, in my opinion, the option becomes useful. <br><br>  In the BTNotification settings on your smartphone / tablet, you can specify which applications can send notifications to bb-mobile micrON-4.  By default, the jackdaws are next to all installed programs, and I left only Kontaktik, Gmail and Instagram. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eac/c1f/614/eacc1f614036db8e7be1ca99b7507fd7.png"><br><br>  The situation with these applications is as follows.  In the case of the VK.com client, the text of the incoming messages is displayed on the headset screen - for example, ‚ÄúHello!  How are you?".  Of course, it‚Äôs impossible to answer the personal from the headset, but the fact that their text is displayed is quite satisfactory for me: as a rule, they don‚Äôt write anything serious to me on the social network, and you can answer later.  With Gmail is more complicated: if the letter is one, then the author is displayed, but the text is not.  If there are several letters, then their number is shown (for example, 3), but without the author.  In the case of Instagram, the bb-mobile micrON-4 screen shows who liked your photo. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/36e/475/9d3/36e4759d38f3034ead4c0bb2126d348c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/57b/d7b/cef/57bd7bcef3ef57ed2641da952d6d00d4.jpg"><br><br>  All notifications are stored in the ‚ÄúReminders‚Äù menu item, there can be no more than 10. Switching between notifications is done with buttons 1 and 3. When an incoming person or a like micrON-4 beeps and shows an exclamation mark in the indicator bar. <br><br>  <b>What else have you said?</b>  Charging bb-mobile micrON-4 with an hour and a half talk per day is required about once a week.  Menu at the headset in the form of "carousel".  Among the functions that are not related to calls / messages / notifications, I note the stopwatch and a reminder of the disconnection with the head unit.  That is, micrON-4 will begin to squeak if you forget your smartphone, for example, at the bar counter. <br><br>  <b>Summarize</b> .  In my humble opinion, bb-mobile micrON-4 is a mast for owners of large smartphones and tablets with 3G / 4G modems.  For the latter, especially if you are talking to them, - in general, what the doctor ordered.  There are drawbacks, of course, too: the melody is only standard, the contacts are tightened by those that are needed and those that are not needed, the keyboard personally seemed to me average in terms of convenience.  But the rest - offset.  It turned out useful and quite convenient accessory, which is also worth sane money - less </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/222885/">https://habr.com/ru/post/222885/</a></p>
