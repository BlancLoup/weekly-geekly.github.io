For us, it represents an informal knowledge base, which we are happy to share on Habr√©.  Taking into account the fact that we often conduct interviews with experts from the core fields of activity, we decided to acquaint you with what IaaS and business thinks about the interaction, head of cloud computing at the company developing systems for accounting and management automation. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/268865/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/470/49d/cee/47049dceea3f4bb3bb78a827cbc990c0.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>/ Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/keoni101/">Keoni Cabral</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i> <br><br><h2>  1. Everything is just beginning here. </h2><br>  Indeed, all major changes in the Russian IaaS market began quite recently.  The number of providers has increased in the wake of the demand for such services, completely new business models have appeared (based on IaaS), plus we have new legislation in the field of storage of personal data of citizens.

      Today, our young and promising market is learning from foreign colleagues and adopting both experience in working with clients and a number of finds as part of creating automation products. <br><br><blockquote>  For example, I saw in the work a script with automatic balancing of the server load, where, before transferring the server, first it is the ‚Äúexchange‚Äù cheap resources that are polled.  And only if nothing was found there, the server is started on new resources. <br><br>  - Victor Kanaev </blockquote><br><h2>  2. Blind copying does not give results. </h2><br>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaster_recovery">Disaster Recovery is</a> quite popular in the West, but the Russian client does not want to overpay for what happens with a minimum probability (close to zero).  This situation is very similar to insurance - CTP and CASCO. <br><br>  It is very important to offer an alternative, which will consist in the fact that you just need to wait a bit while the data is restored from the backup.  To pay for the additional DR service in this case is no longer necessary, which cannot but please a significant part of the customers. <br><br><h2>  3. Important openness </h2><br>  Such an atmosphere - a young market with its own characteristics and mentality - places certain responsibilities on providers.  They need to engage not only in self-improvement, but also in training the audience. <br><br><blockquote>  Any IT systems, like ships, cars and other mechanisms, still break.  Therefore, we have added another criterion - openness and the ability of the provider to find compromise solutions in crisis situations. <br><br>  - Victor Kanaev </blockquote><br>  Here it is important to understand that the client is not always aware of all the intricacies of the functioning of the service systems of the provider.  He does not understand why there can be one or another reaction to his actions, how the work will be done in a critical situation, and so on. <br><br><blockquote>  If you organize your SaaS solution and use the power of another provider for this, then in case of its accident you will fall into a kind of informational vacuum. <br><br>  You do not know when everything will return to normal, what to broadcast to customers and how to explain to them the inaccessibility of the service. <br><br>  - Victor Kanaev </blockquote><br>  On the other hand, it is impossible to overload the client with complex features.  A business should do its work, and not understand IT terminology.  This is the essence of IaaS - to allow people to focus on business, and reassign the minor infrastructure maintenance tasks to professionals. <br><br>  Other materials from the IT-GRAD <a href="http://www.it-grad.ru/iaas/iaas-vmware/virtual-infrastructure/">virtual infrastructure</a> provider blog: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/316286/">‚ÄúA bit about platforms‚Äù: The future of AIaaS</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/316290/">"New Year's Eve Shopping": VMware acquired PLNgrid SDN startup</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D1%2585-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9-%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8-%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258E-security-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC">Cloud Security Testing</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/vmware-cloud-foundation-%25D1%2583%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2589%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D1%258B%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2586%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0">VMware Cloud Foundation: Simplified Software Data Center Deployment</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://iaas-blog.it-grad.ru/%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BF%25D1%258B%25D1%2582-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-iaas-%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8">Cloud services: experience of using IaaS by Russian companies</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/268865/">https://habr.com/ru/post/268865/</a></p>
