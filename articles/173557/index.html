  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HTC Butterfly - beauty at your fingertips</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> More recently, the abbreviation Full HD caused associations only with modern TVs and monitors for working with graphics.  1920 pixels fit perfectly on 22-27 inches of computer displays, and they felt quite comfortable on the impressive diagonals of home screens.  It is all the more surprising to see the same figures relating to the compact display of a mobile device. <br><br>  Such an impressive resolution came to smartphones quite recently, and the number of models present in the market can be counted on the fingers of one hand.  However, one of them has outstripped competitors and is already on sale.  As you can guess, we are talking about one of our new products - HTC Butterfly - the first phone with a Full HD-display, which went on sale in the territory of the Russian Federation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d5/12b/a56/7d512ba56a91fba41a2fbfed2640e49d.jpg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Due to the fact that the interaction with the modern smartphone is mainly done with the help of taps on the screen, it is not difficult to explain such a serious attention to this component.  However, the other parameters of the device do not allow him to hit the face in the dirt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/818/af1/f23/818af1f2385d1ae98c5d309f3dd2785d.jpg"><br><br>  The company's engineers used the updated Qualcomm Snapgragon S4 Pro APQ8064 SoC, supplemented by the Adreno 320 graphics accelerator, to show your favorite games and the necessary applications without delay. HTC Butterfly shows impressive results both in synthetic tests and in actual use, let alone work interface, characteristic for devices on Android previous generations, you can safely forget. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/747/c9f/36d/747c9f36d4a01fb8be00394b7be949c7.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/250/a73/3c5/250a733c5f1f57b5f4e9e6dffaa19aa5.png"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e9/edf/1d6/2e9edf1d645db2bc424ed2524f7a0117.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/047/5ec/a4c/0475eca4c969bab3400699e115b7a525.png"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed9/4db/008/ed94db008bdddb9128937ff3ff6492a1.png"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3e6/db6/d19/3e6db6d19892cc519b9590695e72fcf0.png"></a> <br><br>  Despite the fact that the diagonal of the display is an impressive 5 inches, the ‚ÄúButterfly‚Äù can be called light (138 grams) and relatively compact (141 x 70.5 x 9 mm).  The battery is non-removable, but in terms of battery life, we will still go, but for now we will continue to scrutinize the device from all sides. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78a/93d/e61/78a93de6110ccdd71906d4ae2a17aec0.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d47/a60/bee/d47a60bee3c68431df854779fd34709f.jpg"><br><br>  Attention is drawn to the red "edges" on the ends.  They are perfectly combined with the Beats logo and design of the rim of the camera, reviving in memory the associations with HTC One X + and Sensation XE, made in similar colors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b2d/60d/28b/b2d60d28be2a062bbfde535814095fb4.jpg"><br><br>  Complements the picture of the usual LED flash, part-time working as a flashlight.  The most interesting, as usual, on the other hand.  The display of the device boasts not only a record resolution and pixel density (441 ppi), but excellent color reproduction, excellent viewing angles and good protection from external influences. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/df3/37f/9db/df337f9dba1730c0080fa8a38e1ae9ca.jpg"><br><br>  Made on technology Super LCD3 matrix covers glass Gorilla Glass 2, so that minor scratches and other troubles can not be afraid. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c45/2bd/587/c452bd587e0d9542143775ca81176baf.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/19e/b48/ea8/19eb48ea84fc67b0c5f90bc84a262809.jpg"><br><br>  Before considering the software component, let's take a look at the remaining characteristics and connectivity options.  Gentleman's set of sample 2013 is presented in full: Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi a / b / g / n, NFC, GPS / GLONASS, DLNA for transferring content to compatible TVs, as well as USB with MHL support.  To implement the latter, however, you will need an appropriate adapter, but if necessary, their acquisition should not be a problem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/af2/bf9/b73/af2bf9b73c84dc7c2433b0eaeb346601.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, the microUSB interface connector is protected by a tight plug, and the phone itself claims to comply with the IPX-5 standard, which implies protection against splashes.  Of course, it is not recommended to dip it into water, but you can safely take a tube in the rain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c9/46b/1a8/2c946b1a874d1dbb257a5dda70a3c1c1.jpg"><br><br>  Like all new devices, Butterfly provides connectivity through a micro SIM card inserted in the appropriate tray on the top of the device.  A neat clip is provided for its opening, but if the situation is urgent and there is no branded accessory on hand, any will do. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/698/23e/81f/69823e81ffe8c8562d3e14d72fa6b496.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to a small metal object, the kit includes a standard headset with a microphone, a pile of useful papers, a charger with a USB port and a cable for synchronization and charging.  Neat and beautiful packaging, in turn, continues the traditions embodied in the One series. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/15f/842/375/15f8423756a285c3d88831350e916be6.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f5/24b/b78/9f524bb781c1ad698899d367a9261120.jpg"><br><br>  A large power button is located between the headphone jack and the SIM tray.  The decision to place it in the center is reminiscent of the company's first ‚Äútwo-pointer‚Äù - Desire V, but in this case the button is perfectly highlighted and easily grope even blindly.  The volume rocker, in turn, suggests a similar HTC One control, and it would not hurt to add a bit of relief.  However, under the thumb of her right hand, she lays down like a glove. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/390/067/36e/39006736e42e787b4e5036ae9f27ee5f.jpg"><br><br>  The internal memory in the device is 16 GB, and the operational memory - as much as 2 gigabytes.  Favorite games and background applications are now not exactly "fly out", and the lack of a memory card slot in the European version of the device is designed to compensate for 25 GB of cloud storage in Dropbox.  It is enough to log in to the service with a new device, as additional space will be immediately provided to you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b28/f40/d0c/b28f40d0caf82516d82b4a5d9c0163a1.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6d8/08b/11a/6d808b11a4b06ff57347750ac6e17ffd.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/20f/069/202/20f069202627e4be77592cecc1031a73.png"><br><br>  Like the HTC One X +, the device runs on Android 4.1.1, supplemented with the HTC Sense 4+ shell.  Rumor has it that in the very near future, NTS will begin releasing an update to Sense 5.0, demonstrated along with the new flagship One, and Butterfly will also be affected by this distribution. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/39e/835/ddb/39e835ddb46d91ce5ee7d5fd17620f05.jpg"><br><br>  In the meantime, we have at our disposal a familiar and user-friendly interface, with the features of which you probably already know.  The wealth of branded widgets, ease of customization and wide personalization options have long made HTC Sense a brand whose name speaks for itself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/185/f04/b82/185f04b82609e51a8b22438f36a28111.png"><br><br>  By the way, the new device can be configured from the computer by selecting the order and location of the widgets in advance.  In addition, settings via the web interface at <a href="http://start.htc.com/">start.htc.com</a> can be bookmarked in a standard browser, notification sounds, and lock screen shortcuts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b77/87a/38d/b7787a38d3c94b841c4576ea75b51aaf.png"><br><br>  This will allow for the registration of accounts with maximum comfort, resulting in a fully operational unit. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a56/52a/0a9/a5652a0a969f7f2a27a233f2ac0631b4.png"><br><br>  The gallery still supports the display of information from cloud hosting and other accounts, it is enough to enter the necessary accounts once in the settings section.  The sort of ‚Äúdefault‚Äù was sorting by date, automatically generating not just albums, but collections of impressions about the places and events where you happened to be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aff/f7c/d64/afff7cd64bb06d35d078f87bba2eb882.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/015/29c/674/01529c67478b01a098a740ac46e442c1.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cf2/9e7/13d/cf29e713dd601a499e55b68140e7d0e9.png"><br><br>  In addition, geotags are assigned to photos, on the basis of which a photo map of trips and travels is easily and quickly built.  However, for adherents of the traditional approach, a standard display order is provided, which allows, if necessary, to exclude certain directories. <br><br>  Entire folders can easily fit into the dock, and widgets, when added to desktops, can be displayed either as a general list or with a split for specific suppliers.  The number of available desktops traditionally varies from one to seven, so that both lovers can make a suitable option, as well as fans of minimalism. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b2c/f36/978/b2cf369781299f5452e3b480c6a4701e.jpg"><br><br>  Older applications that are not accustomed to the absence of the Menu button can be used with the same comfort as the programs in Holo design.  It is enough to prioritize the use of the "Recent Applications" button, and a long press will allow you to access the context menu without resorting to displaying an interfering screen button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/be0/c32/c51/be0c32c51247c985f3431ccbbc8cc840.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a8a/4bd/af6/a8a4bdaf625c560d90a6427f886fa53c.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2db/f27/4cd/2dbf274cda5ba1bd5085715ff0a41c32.png"><br><br>  The dialer, clock, weather, calendar, and more - all these applications are in their places, and their level of performance allows you not to waste time searching for third-party alternatives.  The same is true for a music player that successfully activates the Beats Audio profile when connecting a complete headset or your own headphones. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ef7/818/171/ef7818171748e4cd0cbb2abd663f18fb.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d36/d15/9bc/d36d159bcf39eaa2c8ba47e50ab48333.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/750/a32/106/750a321065da77a49557e9afb4fd98fa.png"><br><br>  In the process of listening to music, it is impossible to notice a fair amount of volume and overall balance of playback, and the ringing speaker will not allow you to miss an incoming call. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/155/6b0/3be/1556b03bea569ef19d4f57141bcb23d8.jpg"><br><br>  When a free minute is issued and you want to show your creative potential, the HTC Butterfly camera will be most welcome.  The eight megapixel matrix with autofocus, flash and backlight is standard for the industry, but thanks to the f / 2.0 high-aperture and proprietary post-processing algorithms, the output results in very decent frames. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a42/9ef/950/a429ef95008e866e54871274faf077a4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/153/25f/cfb/15325fcfba10eeab8c3eaf605da5abf2.png"><br><br>  The front camera, in turn, takes two-megapixel photos, and the video in a suitable Full HD resolution for this device shoots both.  While shooting video using the main camera, you can take pictures by simply pressing the corresponding on-screen button, and continuous shooting will not exactly let you miss the best shot. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cd3/ac6/0fa/cd3ac60faf4a80574cf3b7e191fdc0fd.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9f2/d22/830/9f2d228309779460da5f9de34890e3e6.png"><br><br>  The most convenient in this algorithm is the ability to instantly delete all the failed photos by selecting the best one in the preview menu.  Such a scheme subsequently saves not only time, but also space in the device's memory, because each file takes 2-3 MB. <br><br>  Examples of images taken in various conditions (including HDR mode) can be found below.  All photos are clickable and contain links to the originals in the original resolution. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1e0/80b/382/1e080b38249389ec176a7c3809acf735.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cfd/1cb/bf8/cfd1cbbf84b27c02301834772e0c233f.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c42/3be/dda/c423bedda01b4ddb6c470786cae4e55e.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9a/ff0/b0e/c9aff0b0e78013a92636b6f323658fd1.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/85c/5e5/262/85c5e5262674758bc32a9791b385d0a3.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ecc/bcb/727/eccbcb727ee898f115947a7d7dd9c44e.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d0c/05d/b70/d0c05db70c9b0f836093481022379a8b.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a35/185/b5f/a35185b5fcc93be9829bfca95bf6759e.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6a9/f89/201/6a9f8920145900aec2114175eb22f8f3.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/143/168/cd8/143168cd88367d3efb640209f965ab7a.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4ce/539/96d/4ce53996d26053ccd2df3f861f437acd.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab7/592/3a1/ab75923a1de70e71edfa76a2b7a5c0c3.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/eef/0bf/336/eef0bf33672e46eb4746611f99df4caf.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a43/fd7/0e9/a43fd70e982597f6ce120afc1296cfdd.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/578/54c/8d6/57854c8d6c4723e3e8829a96486b8722.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Like the HTC One X +, Butterfly allows you to record video sequences with an increased frame rate (120 fps), which is especially valuable for dynamic scenes and fast moving objects.  An example of shooting a standard video in maximum quality is available <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmNPR2gSVBi4">here</a> , and the result of the activity of the front camera can be found <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DlxnrL8o3Tdc">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c06/61f/acc/c0661faccfaaee0e77a88a5fcc9bcfff.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a1c/ffe/241/a1cffe241188fae1bfd78c2903364851.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e7/860/78d/7e786078d806d1c05d90cde5d2df52ba.png"><br><br>  A reasonable question arises - what is the situation with the battery life?  It would seem that there is both an energy-intensive screen with natural color rendition and breathtaking resolution, and a powerful quad-core processor, and network services always want to synchronize.  In this case, opposite the column "Battery capacity" in the body of the performance characteristics is far from a record value - 2020 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c2e/240/311/c2e24031147139d68d129a63a714bf82.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a80/1eb/2dd/a801eb2ddcbaf95c9e351453aa5e104a.png"><br><br>  Nevertheless, a smart and productive machine easily withstands a standard working day, which includes not only network activity and making calls, but also breaks into resource-intensive three-dimensional games.  The screen brightness was automatically adjusted during the testing process, but it was enough with a margin, and Butterfly had no problems with readability in the sun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0ac/78f/dea/0ac78fdea23cb1466bcd3a53af80389a.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, if you play the same Real Racing 3 for several hours at maximum screen brightness, the device is predictably and completely discharged, but this scenario cannot be considered as the main one.  In conditions of mixed use, if you have configured email accounts and social media accounts, you should not worry about the battery.  HTC Butterfly will be your faithful companion from morning to late evening, and every glance at it will be fun. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173557/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173557/</a></p>
