Today, May 22, is the birthday of Windows 3.0.  28 years ago (can you imagine?) The first version of Windows was released, which won wide popularity among users.  We decided to pause for a bit and wrote an article about significant PC versions of the system.  Let's start with edinichki and come to a dozen, but there are more than ten of them.  More under the cut. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eb/mj/yd/ebmjydfls3pkykbouivs_2qxgu0.jpeg"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So let's go!  Microsoft Windows was introduced by Bill Gates on November 10, 1983.  Initially, Windows was just a graphical add-on program for the operating system of the 80s and 90s MS-DOS. <br><br><h2>  Windows 1.0, 1985 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cd/rr/ro/cdrrroy-_cfiu1zmbgwc-zxeqwy.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="http://all-thinks.ru/20-noyabrya-vypushhena-windows-1-0/">Img source</a></i>

      Firstborn  Something is not black.  4 versions.  3 updates.  But so far not a success.  Windows 1 did not become a breakthrough for the company on the market, but it launched the family.  Today she is almost 33 years old (Birthday November 20). <br><br><h2>  Windows 2.0, 1987 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q5/1i/j4/q51ij4p3_p2hgkuxdj1jcknphui.jpeg"><br>  <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2.x"><i>Img source</i></a> <br><br>  The second version of Windows was born in cold December 1987. And it‚Äôs really cold.  December 9, the day of release, in Moscow, for example, was before -11.  For comparison, in the recent December 9 the number was -4.  Among the innovations of the system were, for the first time, overlapping windows.  The system received a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Data_Exchange">dynamic data exchange protocol</a> and support for going beyond the limits of DOS main memory. <br><br><h2>  Windows 3.0, 1990 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/bc83945f/921efc95/406fc5e6/ef5a2f47.png"><br>  <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_3.x">Img source</a></i> <br><br>  And here is the birthday boy.  It was in Windows 3.0 that the file manager appeared.  Also seriously improved program manager.  And the version has received many innovations that are useful for developers. <br><br><h2>  Windows NT 3.1, 1993 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/k7/qc/e3/k7qce3fcscourams1vm2ilsgrau.png"><br>  <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_3.1">Img source</a></i> <br><br>  The progenitor and XP, and sevens, and today's dozens - NT 3.1.  It was the first time that the NT kernel was used.  In addition, the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/NTFS">NTFS</a> file system first appeared in it. <br><br><h2>  Windows NT 3.5, 1994 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tm/f7/dk/tmf7dkmvn8obfo6tgw5l1isjuwu.png"><br>  <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_3.5">Img source</a></i> <br><br>  An important version, although not indulging in a large number of innovations.  It was seriously optimized compared to the previous version. <br><br><h2>  Windows 95, 1995 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hq/70/3-/hq703-qx-s0zsnbfhp2fvmewpbk.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_95">Img source</a></i> <br><br>  In the yard in 1995.  Java year, by the way.  Microsoft releases a system that is not just a modern one, but truly similar.  More precisely, modern systems are similar to 95. A new interface has appeared in it, and it became possible to use more than 8 characters in file names.  In addition, Plug and Play appeared, you no longer needed to install new devices on your own. <br><br><h2>  Windows NT 4.0, 1996 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/te/gi/kq/tegikqukxbxwjnynktpxjmhiaoa.png"><br>  <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_4.0">Img source</a></i> <br><br>  The latest Windows with the designation NT right in the title.  The style was already like that of Windows 95. It was maintained until 2001, releasing 9 updates with bug fixes. <br><br><h2>  Windows 98, 1998 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sj/ka/c0/sjkac0nzvruga1kjljf-y94f-7s.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="http://ucrazy.ru/foto/print:page,1,1466872204-os-windows-98.html">Img source</a></i> <br><br>  Many people call Windows 98 the ideological continuation of Windows 95. Among the innovations, it is worth mentioning the function of putting the PC into sleep mode, the function of converting the file system from FAT16 to FAT32, as well as the integration of the Windows Update site with which updates could be downloaded. <br><br><h2>  Windows 2000, 2000 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hr/qc/gs/hrqcgscxj3lsyluafcxoasgkb-0.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_2000">Img source</a></i> <br><br>  Is a continuation of Windows NT 4.0.  Of the innovations is to provide support for Active Directory.  The system also includes a third version of <a href="https://www.asp.net/">ASP</a> .  In addition, the encrypted file system EFS. <br><br><h2>  Windows ME, 2000 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/s1/wr/si/s1wrsi1x8nkv3slrzabpkhcx4nw.jpeg"><br>  <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_ME">Img source</a></i> <br><br>  Windows Millennium Edition.  Sounds serious, right?  Unfortunately, the system has been criticized.  However, there was a lot of new things in it: Windows Movie Maker first appeared in it.  In addition, system recovery options and Windows file protection were introduced. <br><br><h2>  Windows XP, 2001 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w1/ct/oh/w1ctohhuqahtakvofd6xhxmeo7y.jpeg"><br><br>  Oh yeah.  Honestly, I would love to work with XP now.  Appearing in the summer of 2001, it won the hearts of many developers and users for a long time, and for a reason.  From the point of view of design, smooth lines appeared in XP - the system proceeded to this as the auto industry, moving away from right angles.  Now it was possible to quickly change users and remotely control the computer.  Also, the command line received improvements and a lot of other things.  In 2014, we stopped supporting it. <br><br><h2>  Windows Vista 2007 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kw/ar/m2/kwarm2w-feqskbac2tod7v_pljy.jpeg"><br><br>  It has become faster than XP in many aspects, as well as safer than XP.  It first appeared Bitlocker, Windows Defender and parental controls.  Further updates added Windows Search 4.0 and many more minor changes and improvements. <br><br><h2>  Windows 7, 2009 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cw/7f/c2/cw7fc2p0lyaqqb9rqvt6psucpv0.jpeg"><br><br>  Seven.  It is still popular, for sure in the voting below we will see it.  And she is really cool.  From the new one, a multitouch appeared in it, a new Windows Media Player interface and much more.  By the way, 6 unique desktop wallpapers were made for Russia.  The design has also changed a bit.  It makes no sense to describe it, and so everyone knows. <br><br><h2>  Windows 8, 2012 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/as/u9/bh/asu9bhhhykvkfo7_86azfgduz4c.jpeg"><br><br>  We come to an ambiguous system.  It was released only 6 years ago, but for 2 years it has not been supported.  The style was completely different, in the eight it was based on the principle of <a href="">Metro</a> .  It is in this system that the Microsoft account, the Windows Store, the usual guide today, as well as the new task manager appeared.  Missing start menu. <br><br><h2>  Windows 8.1, 2013 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wb/0-/br/wb0-brwtgu3wniw4mqslwlblc_s.jpeg"><br><br>  It appeared just a year after the release of Windows 8. Because of this, and not only there were not so many innovations.  One of them is the fourth version of PowerShell.  Also, the start menu is back. <br><br><h2>  Windows 10, 2015 </h2><br><img width="500" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ah/uc/ro/ahucrotwapncrxaieonrd8_wcli.jpeg"><br><br>  Windows 10 is today's current version of Windows.  Compared to 8.1, the following appeared in it: Start was returned fully, significant interface improvements, and a Linux kernel interface emulation was developed.  In addition, added a huge number of innovations, here it makes no sense to list them.  By the way, we have removed the sapper, kerchief, spider and so on.  But do not worry, now everything is in one application.  If you turned off the Internet (I had this in the plane), you can still escape from boredom. <br><br><h2>  To be continued </h2><br>  These are the main versions of Windows.  There were others, but we will consider them as the updates described. <br><br>  And yes, everyone watched the new Avengers?  Thanks <a href="http%253A%252F%252Fplayboyrussia.com%252Fprikoly%252Fstark-ya-plokho-sebya-chuvstvuyu-samyy-glavnyy-mem-filma-mstiteli-voyna-beskonechnosti%252F">@starrcunanan</a> for a cool meme. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fa/wp/4a/fawp4amzqasbmrljss3cfjieu_u.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/359046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/359046/</a></p>
