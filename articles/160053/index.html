      Music, movies, TV shows and a subscription to podcasts.  Everything is tied to a small Apple ecosystem.  Very beautiful little loop to keep people attached to their gland. <br><br>  Imagine just for a moment that the Sony DVD player would only lose to Sony Movies movies.  And if you decided to buy a new player from Samsung, then none of the films would show on the new device, at least without serious fraud. <br><br>  This is the ‚Äúfenced garden‚Äù in which many companies are trying to drag us at the moment.  And I think this is idiocy. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In the UK mobile network, you can use any phone you want.  Iron and service are completely separated.  This contributes to the development of competition, as users know that if they don‚Äôt like HTC, they can turn to Nokia and everything will continue to work the same way as before. <br><br>  But if all contacts, entertainment services and backups are tied to HTC - well, then consider that you are just damn unlucky if you want to move. <br><br>  I want to see here the complete separation of church and state.  Iron must be separated from the software.  Software should be separated from services. <br><br>  I want to watch Nokia movies on my Samsung device that runs on Google Android, and then back them up to DropBox. <br><br>  This is how it works ‚Äî more or less ‚Äî on personal computers.  And I do not understand why this does not work for tablets and smartphones?  Why should I buy a tablet that works with content from only one provider?  Whether it is Amazon, Microsoft or Apple, this creates an unpleasant monopoly that raises prices and reduces quality. <br><br>  I know, I know.  The mantra "it just works."  But I was a little tired of tweaking the tablet to work with the NAS, and then tune the TV to work with both.  This situation is connected not only with the fact that all my equipment is from different manufacturers - this is mainly due to the fact that manufacturers do not introduce open standards. <br><br>  I am afraid of what will happen when the provider closes its services.  I joked that Apple would go bankrupt - but even if they stay afloat, what's stopping them from deleting all the music and movies you bought?  In the end, they closed the Mobile Me service with almost no warning and deleted all the data of paid users who were located there. <br><br>  Adobe nailed its DRM servers, notifying everyone for 9 months - closing access to all the books they bought.  Amazon clears Kindles.  Google took Google Video to the forest and shot it - along with Buzz, Wave and God knows how many products.  Microsoft opened PlaysForSure and then allowed it to die, taking with it millions of music files on devices that are no longer supported. <br><br>  So maybe I‚Äôll stick to Google and hope that my Google TV will be able to get on with my Google Phone while I watch movies from Google Play and listen to music from Google Play Music, sharing them on Google+ on my Google ChromeBook and buying all through google wallet.  And I will send them the prayers of the technology geek - ‚ÄúLord, please, don't let them decide that this useful service is not profitable.‚Äù <br><br>  I just want to be left alone.  I want my diverse equipment to communicate with each other.  I do not want to live in a house where everything must be done by one company, otherwise nothing works normally.  I do not want to get stuck in a crappy product due to the fact that only he offers service X. <br><br>  I do not want toys that work only on their kind of batteries. <br><br>  I don't want to be part of your fucking ecosystem. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160053/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160053/</a></p>
