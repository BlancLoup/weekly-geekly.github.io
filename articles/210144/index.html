They all wanted to know what we are shooting there and what kind of Google is these (although many have already heard about them).  And we decided that it would be nice to try to do some kind of action on Union Square (the central square in San Francisco). <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  5 years ago I was fond of photography and my favorite style of photo I had portraits.  It's very simple - you take a 50mm lens, set the aperture at 1.4 and you get just divine photos!  The trick is that the world through a 50mm lens looks just like a human eye sees it.  And the fully open aperture blurs the background very nicely.  Therefore, my task was pictures.

      Pavel Kholyavkin is in the info business and has his own <a href="http://appincubator.pro/">Appincubator</a> show (mobile application incubator), where he teaches people how to create a business on mobile applications.  Pavel filmed a video on GoPro - the videos are dynamic if you install GoPro on a stick. <br><br>  Viktor Kryukov is an extraordinary and communicative person who can write a letter to Mark Pincus (CEO Zynga) ‚ÄúHello, man, let's get some coffee‚Äù and get an answer.  His task was to communicate with passersby. <br><br>  We cleaned up and decided that we didn‚Äôt want to spend money on the experiment, but it would be interesting to make everything qualitative, so it was decided to buy the entire staff at Best Buy, to have fun and give it all back.  I wanted to postpone the whole event to ‚Äútomorrow‚Äù, but it became clear that you need to go now or never. <br><br>  At BestBuy, we bought: <br>  foto Nikon D5200 <br>  Nikkor 50mm 1.4 lens <br>  camera Go Pro 3 Hero black edition <br>  2 SD cards for 32GB <br>  All this right in the parking lot was unpacked, the boxes stuck in the trunk and on Lyft went to Union Square. <br><br>  The concept was very simple: I suggest that the Americans put on a Googleglass so that we could take them and send them a photo with glasses to them in the mail.  But in the opinion of the Americans, it was VERY DIFFICULT! <br><br>  Firstly, we did not take into account that the iPhone is now the most popular camera in the world and the Americans simply do not understand what a quality portrait is.  And print out examples of photos so that people understand what we offer - we did not have time to do it. <br><br>  Secondly, we did not take into account the target audience, they were innovative people who were interested in what Googleglass is, to all other citizens, except how to look at it all from the side was not particularly interesting. <br><br>  Thirdly, it was more interesting for them to try how the glasses work much more than to get a photo. <br><br>  Therefore, right along the way, we changed the concept to a simpler one: <br>  Try Google Points! <br>  And then the people began to respond more vividly. <br><br>  Then the police drove us out of Union Square in about 15 minutes, they said that we needed permission to start a rally there.  And we moved to a more passing place on the other side of the street.  Where did the cop on the moto drive us too :) By the way, he didn‚Äôt want to wear a Googleglass ‚Äúbecause you aren‚Äôt Google‚Äù :) <br><br>  The action turned out to be very interesting and fun, we spent a couple of hours, laughed heartily and got excellent material that you can watch on the video.  I have not held a camera in my hands for more than a year (by the way, photographic equipment has progressed very much over the last couple of years!) So I was very exited :) <br><br>  By the way, the official Googleglass community said thank you;) Thanks for the bread you don‚Äôt like, but three pairs of Googleglasses personally from Sergey Brin would be interesting;) <br><br>  <a href="">Dmitry Semiryazhko</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/krukau">Viktor Kryukov</a> / <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Pasha.Holyavkin">Pavel Kholyavkin</a> <br><br>  PS This is my first article, so you can throw rotten tomatoes in the comments or on Facebook. <br><br>  Dmitry Semiryazhko, a serial entrepreneur, co-founder of the American company #Pinxter with a development office in Sevastopol, shared his story for <a href="http://siliconnews.ru/AmBAR">AmBAR</a> and Habrahabra. <br><br>  <i>Note from the account holder: I am not the author of the article, I am publishing an article for the trial of the Habrasoobshchestva, because</i>  <i>she seemed interesting to me.</i>  <i>Other articles from the inhabitants of Silicon Valley can be found <a href="http://siliconnews.ru/">here</a> .</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/210144/">https://habr.com/ru/post/210144/</a></p>
