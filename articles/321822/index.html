This is one of the foundations of our web design today.  The interaction of users with modern websites is seriously tied exactly to the animation.  She is able to report on certain states of the page, to direct attention.  Animation helps the user to see the result of his actions and can influence his behavior. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/ee9/d70/736/ee9d70736756ed0e8aea7b578afdb54e.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  When can animation improve the user experience of working with pages?  What exactly is it worth ‚Äúreviving‚Äù in order to make interaction with a resource more convenient, understandable, and exciting? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Animation and sequence of events</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Animation when loading data</font> </h3><br>  <a href="http://babich.biz/progress-indicators/">Distracting the user</a> while downloading content is one of the most common situations for using animation.  The fact is that the animation in such moments affects the way people perceive time.  It creates the feeling that the action is faster than it actually is. <br><br>  <b>If the execution time of the action cannot be reduced, you should always strive to ensure that the user is not bored waiting.</b>

      The simpler the load animation is, the better.  In doing so, you should be very careful about any additional effects, like sounds.  Usually they are simply not needed.  A good download animation takes the visitor‚Äôs attention.  At the same time, if the user likes what he sees, if while watching the animation he has some interest, he pays less attention to the duration of the download. <br><br>  Note: there are animated GIF files everywhere, pasted in the form of links and highlighted. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/068/922/a7f/068922a7fcdbf64d76f5c5fb6487ff32.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Even when the load time is short, a funny animation can add an entertaining moment to the anticipation.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">(Author: Thomas Bogner)</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Animation of processes and step-by-step operations</font> </h3><br>  Animation can show the execution of a certain linear sequence of actions, independent of the user.  The classic bootbar is the most common example. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://babich.biz/content/images/2017/02/1-Yput53IzAQ3Rg_Bs4E3JdQ.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Load bar for Aviasales.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">(Author: Mark)</font></i> <br><br>  Animation can be used for processes involving the user performing step-by-step operations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/698/a74/5b0/698a745b0bde64a0bbe5dfff8e9e429b.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Animation can show the passage of the steps of a certain sequence of actions.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">(Author: Joshua Sortino)</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Animation and frame display of web pages</font> </h3><br>  The web page frame mapping option provides for space that is gradually being filled with downloadable information.  Gradual, not torn by periods of "emptiness", filling the page, gives a sense of speed of action.  This technique can be used on almost any site along with unobtrusive animation of the download process, which ensures that the user's attention is maintained. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c7f/4e6/e9e/c7f4e6e9ea3af735132e564714625a59.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Frame screens load user interface elements even before the page content is fully displayed.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">(Author: tqndemseven)</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Visual feedback</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Animated reaction to user actions</font> </h3><br>  A good user interaction design provides feedback that communicates the results of the interaction, making it visible and understandable.  If a site visitor does not know which elements of the pages you can work with, what can be expected from them, he will feel confused.  In order to kill such states in the bud, it is only necessary to carefully design interaction options, making them clear and understandable. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Animation of controls for desktop and mobile sites</font> </h3><br>  One of the most common examples of visual feedback is animation when you hover over an interactive element. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7e8/868/cbd/7e8868cbdb9d8f1df606b18752bb956a.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">When the user is not sure of the control's destination, he tries to hover the mouse over it.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">An animation of the element when you hover the cursor on an intuitive level, will inform the user that you can interact with the object.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">(Source: codepen)</font></i> <br><br>  The above is true for sites that browse on ordinary computers, but mobile devices that do not have mouse cursors on their screens is another story.  Therefore, on mobile sites, buttons and other interactive elements should be equipped with visual cues.  Prompts should indicate, even before the user touches an element, that you can interact with it.  And after touching, you must immediately give visual feedback.  This indicates to the user that his action triggered a system reaction, like the button in the figure below, which looks pressed when touched. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/15e/a2f/337/15ea2f33708ab909533b767a11ae73f5.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Shading indicates that an element can be touched to perform an action.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">(Author: Vadim Gromov)</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Drawing attention with animation</font> </h3><br>  It is well known that our eyes are attracted by movement.  This can be used to direct the user's attention and reinforce the actions they perform. <br><br>  Here, for example, data entry in the form.  Animation is perfect for giving this process new qualities.  In the figure below, the form negatively ‚Äúshakes its head‚Äù in response to an attempt to perform an action with empty fields.  If everything is entered correctly, she may well approvingly "nod."  This animation allows the user to instantly understand what his action has led to. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dfd/9de/cd7/dfd9decd7484ca5d7579c054b4d27d94.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The form negatively "shakes his head."</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">(Author: Micha√´l Villar)</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Navigation</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Transitions and state relationships</font> </h3><br>  Today in the trend are hidden navigation menus that appear when you click on the <a href="http://babich.biz/basic-patterns-for-mobile-navigation/">button-hamburger</a> e. With the help of animation, you can ensure communication of the application's states and prevent too fast eye cutting transitions between screens.  Well-designed transitions give users a clear understanding of where to focus. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/865/b71/708/865b7170839e42a4137cb22ec8a124ec.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Animation can be used to make transitions between application screens more obvious.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">As a result, the user will know exactly where he was at the beginning of the action, and where he was after its completion.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">(Source: codyhouse)</font></i> <br><br>  Here is an example from the Brian Hoff Design website.  When the user clicks the round arrow button, a large menu block appears on the right side of the screen.  Thanks to the animation, the menu seems to leave the area outside the screen.  As a result, there are no logical breaks in the interaction with the page. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9f/bec/c96/b9fbecc96f590bbd0bad686ee04a6e33.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">The animation helps to link the two states of the page together.</font></i> <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Smooth state change</font> </h3><br>  The transition animation is invaluable for specifying a page state change.  In the article ‚ÄúSmart Transitions in UX Design,‚Äù Adrian Zumbrunnen showed a great example of how an animation can help a user stay up to date with exactly where he is at when clicking on a link that leads to another section of the same page. <br><br>  Just compare this with the abrupt transition, which feels like an unnatural "leap." <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56c/2ad/995/56c2ad995631b9b11c8cf02e14c63330.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">A sudden change of state looks unnatural.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The user is hard to perceive like.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">(source: smashingmagazine)</font></i> <br><br>  And here is the same thing, but with animation: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ff/dd4/612/9ffdd46122eb1d33a19114893c2a99b2.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Animate means ‚Äúbreathe life‚Äù (source: smashingmagazine)</font></i> <br><br>  The site navigation mechanism uses unobtrusive animation.  This helps the user to navigate the article, to see exactly where the section it is viewing is located. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Creative effects</font> </h2><br>  A creative approach to animation decorates the interface and adds entertainment value to it.  Sites with similar interfaces are able to delight the visitor and remember him. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#3AC1EF">The art of telling stories and a long scroll</font> </h3><br>  "All attention is on the upper half of the visible part of the site."  Most recently this was the iron rule.  Designers sought, by all means, to fill this area with valuable information.  Now the ‚Äúrule of the upper half‚Äù has lost its absolute truth.  In fact, it is known that "on a regular page, 66% of attention is concentrated below the upper half of the visible part of the site."  Thus, when scrolling a page, what appears from the bottom attracts more attention.  This makes scrolling an integral part of the interaction design. <br><br>  <b>Animations enliven the scrolling process and give pleasure to the user.</b> <br><br>  Animation is able to unlock its potential in storytelling.  This allows the user to create an emotional connection with the interface that would otherwise be boring and expressionless.  There is a very common <a href="http://babich.biz/best-practices-for-long-scrolling/">animation with the effect of parallax</a> , but, we believe, in such situations it makes sense to look for something less conspicuous.  Consider the possibility of splitting the site into "fragments", designed for scrolling.  Within each of these fragments, you can animate the output of texts and images. <br><br>  For example, below are animations that animate a page applied to ordinary images. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d5/187/aab/2d5187aab94246b0e5005bebd79c17d9.gif" alt="image"></div><br>  <i><font color="#999999">Scrolling animation.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Source: Le Mugs</font></i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#3AC1EF">Tools and Tutorials</font> </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://theultralinx.com/2015/01/15-ui-animation-tutorials/">15 interface tutorials</a> .

Design is the management of user interaction and web page.  As a result, animation plays an extremely important role in the transmission of information.  Therefore, when designing pages, it is necessary to remember from the very beginning about the interactive nature of web space and to perceive its manifestations as a natural part of the design. <br><br>  Dear designers!
