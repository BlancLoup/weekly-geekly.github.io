  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We make high-quality binding for your favorite book.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h3>  Introduction </h3><br>  Greetings to all. <br><br>  People love to read.  But not all, and not all.  And that love is not always possible to find in stores.  And if you can find, it is not always affordable.  One elementary fact follows from this: something must be done about it.  Of course, you can read from the screen of the monitor / laptop / phone.  Or print and read in separate, albeit ordered, leaves.  In addition (this is a more costly option, but for the reader it‚Äôs better), you can buy a specialized electronic ink reader.  Yes, it solves the problem, but ... After some time, you start to miss the weight of this book, the rustling of turning over paper pages, and the pile of other similar unimportant, but such pleasant to heart things. <br>  And out of this trouble, too, have their way out.  Just need to make the right book yourself. <br>  Carefully, there <u>are a</u> lot of photos under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Searching on the Internet and showing obstinacy in digging up obstructions of the nepo-nymi, I, through third-party websites, came across two habrastats: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/95761/">First</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/DIY/96684/">Second</a> (the layout is taken in chronological order).  So I will call them in the future.  This article will combine my first experience in creating a book and analyzing two other articles, my explanation of all the pros and cons. <br><br><h3>  Stage 1. Creating a * .pdf file </h3><br><h4>  Point 1. * .pdf of * .txt, * .rtf, * .doc </h4><br>  First you need to create a document in Wicrosoft Word and make an A5 sheet.  To do this, set the following page options: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7a/37/7a371508361adc1467e653e0bc204d96.jpg"></a> <br>  Fields can be varied, but for the best view it should be within: upper, lower, outside - from 10 to 16 mm, inside - from 25 to 30 mm. <br>  Choose your favorite font and font, but do not forget to insert letters for beauty. <br>  The owners of Open Office, I think, will also figure out how to set up such settings.

      <br>
    <h4>  Item 2. * .pdf of * .djvu </h4><br>  To fit the sheet to the A5 format, you need to send a print to WinDjView and select Adobe PDF from the list of printers.  Next, in the properties, designate the following parameters: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2a/b5/2ab55df1b820ed3aa4f3eca584e18088.jpg"></a> <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7c/9a/7c9a06d93510677929bce064f32bf1ae.jpg"></a> <br>  And then "print." <br><br><h4>  Clause 3. * .pdf from * .pdf </h4><br>  Nothing to do this is not necessary.  Whatever the size, they fit.  The main thing that the text was visible. <br><br>  At this stage <a href="http://www.perunica.ru/rukodelie/3010-kniga-svoimi-rukami.html">, this</a> site helped me. <br><br><h3>  Stage 2. Listing </h3><br>  At this stage, I always envy those who have a printer at home, especially if it is two-sided. <br>  But let's not talk about it.  First you need to decide how many sheets will be in the brochures, because if you print the whole book in one brochure, and then bend it, then you‚Äôll get the utter nonsense.  In the first article 10 sheets were made, in the second - 4 sheets.  I got into the books, figured it out, and deduced that the most common number was 8. I did so much. <br>  8 sheets are 32 pages.  In my case, there are 305 pages (by the way, I printed the first two short stories about Sherlock Holmes by Arthur Conan Doyle in the original language). <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/51/2a/512a6630a03337410a893c5a8d61c943.jpg"></a> <br>  In the first paragraph we enter the numbers of the pages that we want to print.  We make sure that there are exactly 32 of them - then there will be no unnecessary spaces (this means that the second number must be a multiple of 32, and the first = the second minus 31).  In the second we choose ‚Äúbrochure printing‚Äù.  If you have a two-sided printer, then in the third paragraph we choose both sides, otherwise - there are also two items ‚Äúonly the front side‚Äù and ‚Äúonly the back side‚Äù, so printing a brochure is also not a problem.  We make sure that clause 4 is strictly ‚Äú1 to 8‚Äù. <br>  The final deviation.  If you do not have a printer - do not worry.  I used the free virtual printer <a href="http://www.dopdf.com/">doPDF</a> , which created pdf files from what I wanted to print.  The result carried in the center of the printout, and there already used a two-sided printer.  And still it turned out not very expensive. <br><br><h3>  Stage 3. Gluing the book block </h3><br>  For this we need: <ul><li>  Printout itself </li><li>  A pair of clamps with boards (press, vice) </li><li>  Brush and PVA glue, preferably building (it is thicker) </li><li>  Pricker and carton longer than 210 mm </li><li>  A piece of fabric less than 210x300 mm (approximately 170x200 will do) </li><li>  two sheets of hard paper on the flyleaf </li><li>  List of actions (for this stage and all further ones, it‚Äôs more convenient) </li></ul><br>  Start of action - 14:20. <br>  We take the printout and sort by notebooks. <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/22/68/22684e676d1ce88ed4fab20fc65615de.JPG"></a> <br>  Then we bend each notebook in half, using something with a sufficiently smooth angle (so as not to leave traces). <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/85/9a/859abad9d5bc8eea2e4cfdc5a5184f52.JPG"></a> <br>  Already by 14:31 such a stack was received: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/93/96/939658b1e5a8a2efd1081921b161f73c.JPG"></a> <br>  Next, take a carton and mark it.  I made marks every 30 mm, calculating that there would be exactly 6 holes, and therefore, each notebook would have exactly three stitches inside.  But this, strictly speaking, is purely my choice. <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/cf/11/cf11458c5b6260e65844841d4b5461bb.JPG"></a> <br>  Speaking of choice.  Now I will explain why I chose this way of sewing.  The first article made cuts, but I reasoned that the glue in them would interfere with the book to unfold normally.  It seems that he judged correctly, because even the glue that penetrated the holes from the awl was enough to (quite a bit) worsen the opening.  In the second article, we sewed on cords, but I thought that the book would be much stronger if these ‚Äúcords‚Äù run along the entire spine, so I chose sewing on a piece of fabric.  Yes, and I took a piece of cloth wider so that I could glue more to the cover, and, as a result, I got a more solid book. <br>  So, while I was chatting, all the holes were made (under the paper I advise you to put several layers of cloth, then it will be much easier to perforate the notebooks) and by 14:47 we got this picture: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/1f/a5/1fa5d5a94064be15be004cf7fc275ac5.JPG"></a> <br>  Then we clamp the resulting book block (IMPORTANT! Do not forget to check the sequence of notebooks!) In a vise to improve the quality of the central folds, while for the time being we will deal with bookends.  I sometimes mess around with paper, so I already have whatman paper sheets cut into 30cm strips.  One of these strips I used: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6e/aa/6eaa60bb670027a9ccaf313d462b8539.JPG"></a> <br>  Marked it up and cut it with your favorite tailoring scissors.  They cut out the necessary piece of cloth (which he immediately patted). <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/40/9e/409e5dd64204afd01d51f63632aa1869.JPG"></a> <br>  By the time the sizing started, it was already 15:18. <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/61/f0/61f0fe96f273c82d44b6d86514cdd490.JPG"></a> <br>  Slightly protruding from the grip back of the block we coat the PVA, and glue the fabric on top (it absorbs well, so we coat it on top too). <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/53/5b/535b404b63adcd2fd8642e56f32120ee.JPG"></a> <br>  Everything, the sequence of notebooks no longer change.  And having ceased to twitch we (at least I) go on a break, small, from 15:48 to 15:58. <br><br><h3>  Stage 4. Gluing the cover </h3><br>  For this we need: <ul><li>  Any thick cardboard (I used cardboard for crafts, 1.75mm thick, can be found in stationery stores) </li><li>  A piece of cloth for the cover (I took the cloth 375x260mm, although some stubbornly offered to use leatherette) </li><li>  The same brush with glue </li><li>  And again a list of actions (optimally - the continuation of the same) </li></ul><br>  Start of action - 15:58. <br>  Again, back to the choice.  Why such a cover?  But just wanted.  A logical chain immediately comes to mind: red-blood-crime-detective-Sherlock Holmes.  No more arguments, except: I do not advise you to make a paper cover - it gets dirty.  It is necessary to laminate at least.  Well, now back to work.  A plan for the future cover is made: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7c/78/7c78506769085bcb5eb5f5dda0610586.JPG"></a> <br>  Transferred to cardboard: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c9/8d/c98d53a8bdcc4fc86d2ec6bbffb3596c.JPG"></a> <br>  And immediately cut (guess what? Of course, tailoring scissors!).  Well, naturally, the fabric for the cover is cut out (and ironed). <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/cb/cc/cbcc9e6125973bb9542b658022f9daf9.JPG"></a> <br>  Quickly?  And already 16:35.  This is how I love these kinds of activities: I thought a little, twitched a little bit with my hands, and the time had passed, imperceptibly and pleasantly.  But now this is not what interests you, but what to do next.  And then the cardboard is glued to the fabric.  Rather, the fabric to the cardboard.  First of all, from the front side, then turn over and fold the fabric in the manner of typographic books, first along the short sides, then along the long ones.  And glue.  The cover is almost ready, it remains only to hold it under the press (note that you need to arrange the cover so that it does not stick to anything, otherwise it will be insulting). <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/0e/ff/0eff831d27a58beaa005cf47b8e7d0fc.JPG"></a> <br>  So it turns out that the clamps are not inactive, at first they kept the book block on the glue, and at 17:18 switched to the future cover. <br><br><h3>  Step 5. Book stitching </h3><br>  For this we need: <ul><li>  Pre-glued book block (which we did in the 3rd stage before) </li><li>  Gypsy needle (just a big needle with a big eye) </li><li>  A thread of sufficient length (I used floss, I calculated the length using the formula: R * N + 50 [cm], where R is the thread length for one notebook {conventionally 21 cm}, N is the number of notebooks. Fifty - stock) </li><li>  And again the list of actions (unexpectedly, yes? Although I myself do not understand why he is here) </li></ul><br>  Start of action - 17:25. <br>  And again about the choice.  The thread is white.  No, I do not think that the colorful thread will be distracting while reading.  I just looked at the result from violet and thought that white would be more aesthetic. <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/43/86/4386ef3076edafd5e02afca167fd3710.JPG"></a> <br>  But now it goes around comes around that I didn‚Äôt make the cuts, because it will have to fall exactly into the holes from the sewing.  This ‚Äúproblem‚Äù is avoided elementary: first, with a needle, we pierce a hole from inside the notebook, exactly at the place of the old one, and only then push the needle outside.  I will say without reserve that for this process I needed pliers, I did not master pulling the needle's needle (with the thread of course) through the cloth and paper.  But it went, and now it is necessary to show what to do to stitch two adjacent notebooks (this moment is perfectly shown in the Second article, only I made a knot at the very beginning, and with it a standard stitching): <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9e/db/9edb1a71f18c953e8b4f21e53072c9dd.JPG"></a> <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7c/6f/7c6fb1e4647e83bee772558a33db9e66.JPG"></a> <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/26/4d/264dc5f663e0c3c904f36ba4437f60f3.JPG"></a> <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6e/c8/6ec8b27e058cb607033daad7a920752d.JPG"></a> <br>  In this way, in addition to glue, the book block also starts to hold the thread!  After taking one twenty minute break, I ended at 19:41.  As a result of my diligence and slowness, a neatly stitched block turned out: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/3e/84/3e84cecb7ad5f4b735a71a1ab0072339.JPG"></a> <br><br><h3>  Stage 6. Crop book block </h3><br>  For this we need: <ul><li>  Clamp (removed one, the second left to put pressure on the cover) </li><li>  Stationery knife with a new chipped blade (or just a very sharp knife) </li><li>  Metal ruler (for selecting the cut line) </li><li>  Iiii ... The list of actions is not needed, but lies somewhere nearby </li></ul><br>  Beginning of action - 19:50. <br>  You can also use the guillotine for trimming, but according to previous authors, it will not give a normal cut of such a number of pages (at least one that can be put at home).  And I don‚Äôt have it at all, so I built the following structure: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/78/cb/78cb73676184a183daf2539c56dffd89.JPG"></a> <br>  Then, cutting through several pages, gradually make a complete cut of the block. <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/81/f8/81f8a885be946aedcc8b40acc53bc34c.JPG"></a> <br>  And so from all three sides.  It sounds long, and it was completed by 20:17. <br><br><h3>  Stage 7, skipped.  Additional processing of the book block </h3><br>  For this we need: <ul><li>  Clipped book block </li><li>  Captal </li><li>  Silk tape for a bookmark (5 mm wide) </li><li>  List of actions (not to forget what I forgot) </li></ul><br>  The beginning of the action did not occur. <br>  A silk tape is stuck on the book block to the spine centimeters by ten, and is left so that when using it as bookmarks it sticks out a couple of centimeters below.  Captals are glued on top, above and below the spine.  Kaptal - a tape of fabric, has a thickening on the one hand.  You can make it yourself: cut a tape centimeters wide at 8, make a fold along the center along it, put a rope in place of the fold, fold and glue it.  Homemade kaptal ready.  The captain keeps the corners of the book block, and the bookmark is the dream of any book lover. <br><br><h3>  Stage 8, the final.  Gluing the cover </h3><br>  For this we need: <ul><li>  Clipped book block </li><li>  Cover </li><li>  List of actions (he suggested what to do next) </li></ul><br>  Start of action - 20:31. <br>  There are no tricks here, just do not get distracted (and therefore there are no photos).  First, the book block fabric is coated with glue, then the cover is from the inside.  While the cover on the book block is being coated, the glue will dry out, but it doesn‚Äôt matter, because we‚Äôve achieved it - we glued the fabric from the inside to the flyleaf. Then we join it.  Then the same, but on the other hand.  The thicker the paper of the bookends, the more glue you can use without fear that it will go in waves.  Everything, the cover is glued.  Now in a vice.  There is nothing more to do, time 20:48. <br><br><h3>  Errors </h3><br>  These two, fortunately, purely theoretical, I walked around them. <br>  1) During the block firmware, do not allow the stitch inside the notebook to be loosely tightened! <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e4/33/e43303237253f63eb4e2727e51436f1d.JPG"></a> <br>  2) During the flashing of the block, it is better to hold the thread while it is being pulled out, such knots can be difficult to untie: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/c6/3c/c63c9b3a9a0e68b89e0cf7372e6f7653.JPG"></a> <br>  Further worse.  Mistakes occurred. <br>  3) When trimming a block, do not try to cut off ‚Äúas little as possible‚Äù, make a margin of a couple of mm, otherwise the same may happen: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/9f/01/9f019b1922614bbd2e49a2054986b26b.JPG"></a> <br>  4) When trimming a block, try to press the knife as evenly as possible on all parts of the book, otherwise a similar wave may occur: <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/27/54/275433038dbd7763af43b4577b61dd3d.JPG"></a> <br>  5) Do not forget about the capt.  With them much better. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  Total, the book is made in 6.5 hours.  And this is only the first attempt, further decently reduce this result.  According to forecasts - two times.  Wow, just a few hours of systematic leisurely work - and the book can be put on the shelf and read when it pleases, you just imagine!  It seems that I have a new hobby ... <br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/37/bd/37bd746897225d2b86e2f504bf917eb5.JPG"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116720/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116720/</a></p>
