      At the last largest consumer electronics exhibition in the world, Bill Gates spoke about some features of the new Windows Vista operating system, in particular, the concept of Connected Experience (which can be translated as ‚Äúconnected or connected experience‚Äù), which provides for a more free exchange of information with each other.  In fact, Gates decided to adopt one of the most popular phenomena of the modern Internet - users all over the world keep millions of blogs, in which they report a lot of useful and not very much information.  Global news agencies are beginning to actively use blogs as a news provider, and companies are starting to advertise on popular blogs.  In the US, the owner of a popular blog can already make money on their readers.  Apparently, Gates, as always, decided to capitalize on the phenomenon that arose without his participation.  For example, it happened at the time with the Internet itself, whose role the founder of Microsoft initially underestimated.  Now the company's software products are actually built on the basis of Internet technologies. <br><br>  Come and talk about cinema.  First, <a href="http://zabyg17.livejournal.com/116339.html">find out in detail</a> and with a detailed description of how and where Operation Y was shot.  Indeed, people have done a great job collecting all the necessary information.  So, for example, the building, on which the action takes place in the first novelty, periodically moves from the Moscow district of Sviblovo to Odessa.  A walk Shurik and Nina, buried his nose in the outline, filmed in Yalta. <br><br>  And on the following link <a href="http://dr-zloben.livejournal.com/193828.html">you will see the box office of the</a> Russian film distribution from 2000 to 2006.  Also done some work on the collection of information.  Interestingly, since 2004, the rating is constantly headed only by Russian paintings. <br><br>  Kamrad thoroughly <a href="http://agent-cuper.livejournal.com/168510.html">dismantled the</a> movie ‚ÄúHighway to Nowhere‚Äù and quite convincingly retell what this strange movie is about. <br><br>  A week ago, the FeedBurner service, which allows website and blog owners to manage their RSS feeds and earn money by placing ads in them, banned their users from indexing feeds via the robots.txt file.  As a result, a number of Russian bloggers using the FeedBurner service for self-promotion, flew out of the search for ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù on blogs, <a href="http://webplanet.ru/news/service/2007/01/11/feedburner.html">reports Vebplaneta</a> .  The reasons for the introduction of such severe measures in FeedBurner are not yet known.  Experts "Webplanet" put forward two versions.  The sublime version says that recently FeedBurner has rolled out a new system of statistics for users and may have decided to clean this statistic of the noise created by search engine bots.  Another, simpler version is that the service, where more than half a million RSS feeds are serviced, experiences heavy loads from search robots, which also steal content for their own purposes.  Now on Yandex, a temporary robots.txt bypass has been introduced for the FeedBurner service.  Probably, the developers of FeedBurner wanted to restrict access for robots of conventional search engines, but did not think that search engines on blogs could also be guided by the robots.txt prescriptions.  A few days later, FeedBurner refused this ban.  As one of the managers of the FeedBurner service, Eric Olson, told Vebplanet, ‚Äúwe just wanted to test something.  Now we have returned everything to the site and again let all the bots. ‚Äù  This action revealed, at a minimum, the fact that Yandex allows itself to easily circumvent the ban on indexing via robots.txt - although Yandex‚Äôs own recommendations clearly state that it is possible to remove from the search in this way.  Thus, the standard, which is provided by this file, is now completely unnecessary, even if the "white" search engines do not perform it, the same Web Planet <a href="http://webplanet.ru/news/service/2007/01/15/feedburner-bots.html">sums up</a> . <br><br>  Each writer has <a href="http://jorian.livejournal.com/201409.html">his own style</a> .  Let me quote: " <em>Nikitin wrote a book, How to Become a Writer," in which he gave a lot of useful advice to beginners. He gives really good advice. He doesn‚Äôt recommend, for example, to use super-long linked constructions, complex sentences, complex concepts, too, numerous turns of events commas - generally bad form, and it‚Äôs not at all worth mentioning in these sentences-caterpillars the notorious girls with defiantly protruding secondary sexual characteristics, all sorts of superheroes with cracking bi</em>  <em>epsov sleeves, his pants too, popped - also from the pressure, clear the stump.</em> " <br><br>  According to official sources, by the end of 2006, the number of Internet bloggers in China had reached 20.8 million;  over three million of them regularly publish their notes.  Xinhua news agency citing a 2007 Internet Survey Report in China (China Internet Survey Report) reported that in 2006, 101 million visits to Chinese blogs were registered.  In particular, the report quotes Huang Chengking of the China Internet Association: ‚ÄúBlogs have gradually become a new channel for sharing information on the Web;  many public figures and ordinary people turn to blogs to express their thoughts. ‚Äù  According to the report, the government‚Äôs concern about the growing popularity of blogs lies at the heart of the decision to develop new rules, according to which the registration of users under their real names can be a prerequisite for blogging. <br><br>  On this, I hasten to finish. <br><br>  <b>Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2007030601.htm">Published in "Computer News" (# 3, 2007)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288556/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288556/</a></p>
