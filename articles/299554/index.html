      In real estate there is a concept called ‚Äúthe best and most efficient use‚Äù (‚Äúhighestandbestuse‚Äù - HABU).  Assessment of objects is based on the best use of land, giving the greatest income. <br><br>  For example, experts can assign such a price for a 3-bedroom house located on a busy street near retail stores, as if the site is occupied by a shopping center.  This is explained by the fact that the best use of property, which gives the greatest profit, is commercial, rather than residential development.  In other words, other 3-room houses in the city can cost 200 thousand dollars, but the investor is ready to give 600 thousand dollars just for the land in order to build a shopping complex on it. <br><br>  Using the next 8 hours of creativity, you need to concentrate on your own HABU - your unique talents, skills and experience that will give the greatest return. <br><br>  Dead weight, which many carry with them, is a <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-sokhranyat-khladnokrovie-na-rabote-v-lyubykh-situatsiyakh/">feeling of dissatisfaction with the work</a> .  Part of the reason for such apathy is a sense of its own uselessness and lack of universality, which allows it to perform any task as ‚Äúexcellent.‚Äù  We are driven into positions and work orders that we are able to perform properly, usually without using our strengths to the maximum. <br><br>  That is why creative activity in your free time brings so much joy.  You create your own job descriptions.  You yourself are your own boss and have the right to focus on what gives you pleasure, and to devote yourself entirely to the cause.  You may not be consistent with the HABU concept during business hours, but to maximize your chances of achieving success in the remaining 8 hours, you need to concentrate on projects focused on your greatest and unique talents.  Right?  I wish everything was so obvious. <br><br>  But again, again and again there are people who open their business and are immersed in ideas that absolutely do not correspond to the most beneficial use of their abilities. <br><br>  They focus solely on what will bring the "highest" profit - that is, on those projects that seem to bring a lot of money - but do not think about what is the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/formula-provala-kak-perestat-sabotirovat-sebya/">"best use" of themselves</a> .  Who has not seen the guys who were unable to set the time on their VCR, who were trying to open technology companies?  The author of the article met with those who tried to launch an application with a video game, without having a gaming experience (and even not feeling sympathy for such a pastime). <br><br>  And what happened next?  All of these enterprises have failed.  Why?  You need to have a passion for your business, otherwise you will abandon it after the first failure.  The more you love what you do, the more persistent you become.  In addition, it is much easier to benefit from their own unique qualities and talents. <br><br>  If you take on something that you barely understand, or something that is not related to your natural inclinations, then it will be much more difficult to succeed. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Exercise: how to find your passion</font> </h2><br>  So what is your best and most profitable use?  Here is a simple exercise that will help determine exactly <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-pravilno-vybrat-klyuchevye-aspekty-zhizni-dlya-togo-chtoby-vkladyvat-v-nikh-energiyu-i-vremya/">what to concentrate on</a> . <br><br>  Create 3 lists.  In the first one, turn on what you succeed in - everything with which you cope with ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù and with what you have mastered. <br>  In the following list, enter what gives you pleasure: hobbies, special interests, games, TV shows, etc. <br>  Finally, in the third column, list everything that gives you a sense of self-worth and relevance.  And now, as if by magic, there are elements included in all 3 lists. <br><br>  So you will open your HABU.  This is what you need to concentrate on in the remaining 8 hours. <br>  Do not get carried away by those things that seem to be the coolest, that is, the most exciting or have the maximum potential, in your opinion. <br><br>  Concentrate on what suits you, what will effectively interact with your skills, interests and higher goals. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/kak-sozdat-kontseptsiyu-razvitiya-sobstvennoy-zhizni/">How to create a concept for the development of your own life</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299554/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299554/</a></p>
