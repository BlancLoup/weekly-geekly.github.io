Now the technology of ‚Äúsmart environment‚Äù has become widespread, and its use in apartments / houses of people has given life to the term ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù.  Well, here without details, let's get down to business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Application in production (now) </h4><br>  And what if you make a smart factory?  Now they use a large number of various sensors: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Sveta; <br>  ‚Ä¢ temperature and humidity; <br>  ‚Ä¢ movement; <br>  ‚Ä¢ smoke; <br>  ‚Ä¢ presence (opening of windows / doors); <br>  ‚Ä¢ other. <br><br>  They have proven themselves not badly, having saved not a little money to the state and our billionaires.

      At present, the sensors in the factories operate offline and are set up for a long time by special service engineers.  The brain of this system is a computer, hidden away from the eyes.  Most systems operate on the basis of bus technology, which consists in using a ‚Äútwisted pair‚Äù, the so-called bus, which carries signals from one device to another.  The system operates at a voltage of 24 V, as a result of which it is absolutely safe for the ‚Äúknow-it-all‚Äù at the factory, and its installation is possible even in rooms with high humidity. <br><br>  All devices of the system are connected in series with each other, while the failure of one device does not mean a malfunction of the entire system. <br><br>  Nobody can configure the system, therefore progress is possible only with: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ equipment upgrades; <br>  ‚Ä¢ improve the quality of sensors; <br>  ‚Ä¢ system response time; <br>  ‚Ä¢ etc. <br><br><h4>  New idea </h4><br>  Therefore, you should focus on more important things.  What else can you think of such a plant? <br><br>  Most recently, people started talking about smart watches, but they have not yet become widely spread due to the fact that not all players have entered the market yet.  The most important trendsetter: the American company Apple still keeps its designs in the shadow.  No wonder the author gives this corporation a special place in the article, you can recall the situation with the iPad, when Steve Jobs showed it to the world.  It was after the presentation of the iPad at the end of January 2010 and the start of sales on April 1 of the same year that the rapid development of the new industry began - tablet computers or, as they are commonly called ‚Äútablets‚Äù.  It‚Äôs safe to say that Apple has created a whole tablet market. <br><br>  In parallel with the smart watch, smart glasses are being developed.  Another American corporation, Google, is developing and has already begun to carry out closed sales of its glasses - Google Glass.  But in this article we will talk about the possibility of using smart watches in production. <br><br><h4>  Minuses </h4><br>  Applying estimated indicators, it is possible to distinguish both pluses and minuses.  The disadvantages of using ‚Äúsmart watches‚Äù have a purely ‚Äúnovelty character‚Äù: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ watches should be constantly worn on the arm; <br>  ‚Ä¢ they need to be charged (at this time, the problem of energy consumption of devices <br>  not yet resolved); <br>  ‚Ä¢ get used to the new way of management. <br><br>  Even ‚Äúgeeks‚Äù (advanced users) have not yet become accustomed to using this innovation, so for ordinary ordinary workers this device may seem outlandish and even superfluous.  But its further use will bring a number of advantages. <br><br><h4>  Pros and functionality </h4><br>  Even, everyone's favorite "iPhones" have a large number of flaws, but this does not prevent them from keeping the first positions in sales before the Christmas holidays.  This is because there are much more pluses than minuses, and their contribution to a person‚Äôs life is significant.  The use of "smart watches" in the production will change today's idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwork as follows: <br><br>  1) The clock will have a map of the enterprise, with all the workshops, cabinets, exits and entrances.  And also the optimal route will be laid, taking into account that some sections of workshops may be temporarily blocked due to some circumstances. <br><br>  2) If a worker leaves the premises (there is no his watch there), then the light turns off (or the lighting becomes dim), saving the enterprise energy. <br><br>  3) There are many installations that have a key with which workers block machines, if they leave.  With the use of "smart watches", when the worker leaves the machine's zone (the working clock does not remove, therefore the clock is also removed (the worker-watch-installation contact comes from them) from the machine's zone, then it goes into the locked mode, just as when turning the usual key that is currently being used. <br><br>  Conventional keys have several disadvantages: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ they can be faked and made contact with the installation, disrupting the process <br>  production.  Each watch will have its own identifier, which allows you to prevent unauthorized entry into the installation management system; <br>  ‚Ä¢ the human factor can play a cruel joke with the worker, and he will simply forget to turn off the installation when he is excommunicated from his place, hoping that he will return soon; <br>  ‚Ä¢ The key can be lost. <br><br>  4) Starting the widespread use of "smart watches", enterprises can <br>  cancel pass systems using them as pass.  I use the NFC module, you can <br>  cancel cash payments and non-cash (namely plastic cards), and start accepting funds using the watch.  The use of this technical solution will give a number of advantages: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ increase the capacity of dining rooms; <br>  ‚Ä¢ abolishing the passes, the employees of the enterprise have a new opportunity to purchase goods in vending machines. <br>  5) Some CNC machine workers are moving away from their plants during their work.  By applying RFID tags in the smartwatch, it will be possible to exercise control over the employee.  Putting cameras and watching is difficult, even if image recognition is applied.  And RFID tags can be a cheap way to improve the quality of production.  Now the use of this technology is difficult, because there is no place where you can embed / embed tags: <br>  ‚Ä¢ in clothes (due to frequent washing they will deteriorate); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Creating an entire object / gadget is expensive. <br><br>  6) Using the OS as a base, and enterprises to take software for "management" from <br>  ‚ÄúClouds‚Äù, it is possible to allow workers to take this device home, to manage their personal space (software for which will also be in the ‚Äúcloud‚Äù, receiving temporary access to the gadget hardware).  Thus, the "smart watch" will be a single standard for the future of mankind. <br><br>  7) Getting the software from the "cloud" will provide the following benefits: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ increased security, because  attackers will not have access to the code <br>  Software that will be on a third-party server; <br>  ‚Ä¢ access to the software will be carried out by security keys that will be <br>  generate the clock itself using my unique identifier.  Increases the complexity of counterfeiting hours - increases the reliability of the system. <br><br>  8) "Smart watches" should be used to diagnose diseases of employees of enterprises.  A neural network located in the cloud, to which the operating system of the ‚Äúrevolutionary gadget‚Äù will apply, will be used for diagnostics. <br>  Why precisely neural network?  Neural networks are nonlinear systems that allow data to be classified much better than linear methods commonly used.  Their use in medicine can significantly improve the quality of the diagnostic method, rejecting the human factor, but reducing its sensitivity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c22/b3d/a92/c22b3da92d9da36f935f858f5a9e0d6e.png">  Ôøº <br>  <i>Neural network example</i> <br><br>  The neural network is able to operate with a large number of primary <br>  conditions - all kinds of data after diagnosis (input neurons), after which various assumptions about diseases (hidden neurons) are formed on their basis, and already at the output we have the result - diagnosis (output neuron). <br><br>  9) The clock will have an alert system that will save time for managers and workers working in different workshops.  Also, it will be possible to send a request to the server, which will use RFID tags to determine the location of the employees you would personally like to contact. <br><br>  Hours should not interfere with work, with excessively large alerts, employees will be distracted. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/138/0da/2f8/1380da2f8ef59ad40756fdac5eb7b5de.png"><br>  <i>Autonomous Geolocation Service</i> <br><br>  10) To prevent unauthorized access to the gadget, it will <br>  have a SightWatch camera that will scan the retina to provide access to the functionality for user authentication. <br><br>  This technology is already being developed by many companies, and Samsung plans in the near future to introduce this functionality into its mobile devices. <br>  Ôøº <br><h4>  Technical implementation </h4><br>  Specification: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ base module (CPU, RAM, GPU). <br>  ‚Ä¢ NFC-module (for cash transactions); <br>  ‚Ä¢ Wi-Fi, Bluetooth. <br>  ‚Ä¢ RFID tags (to control the location of the worker); <br>  ‚Ä¢ SightWatch camera for retinal scanning. <br>  ‚Ä¢ GLONASS-, GPS-modules (geolocation for the application "Maps"). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/25a/dd2/6cd/25add26cd16373dc8d23121f9d4b23e2.png"><br>  <i>The architecture of "smart watches"</i> <br><br>  The base module is very weak (but consumes little energy), because  All calculations will be made in the cloud.  Not only is the software in the "cloud", but the system itself is carried out in the same place.  On the device only come ready results. <br>  Future <br><br>  The use of "smart watches" in production will increase the efficiency of enterprises and facilitate human labor.  Using this gadget will be possible <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ structure receipt of information at the plant, management; <br>  ‚Ä¢ receiving information from the center; <br>  ‚Ä¢ saving time on moving around the enterprise and searching for colleagues; <br>  ‚Ä¢ diagnosis of diseases; <br>  ‚Ä¢ unification of familiar objects: keys, wallet, passes. <br><br>  PS a lot.  Wrote not for Habr, but the beginning of a little trim.  Just thoughts, nothing more ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/213795/">https://habr.com/ru/post/213795/</a></p>
