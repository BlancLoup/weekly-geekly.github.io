  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Version 1.8.0.0 ‚ÄúColosseum‚Äù: SMS bulk distribution, integrated telephony, video calls, accounting statistics, new metro-style windows</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Spring is the time for updates.  ‚ÄúSimple business‚Äù just prepared a new version of the program 1.8.0.0.  "Coliseum".  Innovations will allow you to quickly send SMS, use the built-in IP-telephony, communicate with customers and partners via video.  Innovations will also help to increase the confidentiality of information in the client base and speed up work with the program through the introduction of the metro-style installation wizard and the new menu of the main program window. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Send SMS even faster and to several users at once - a new SMS sending module has been implemented</b> <br>  Want to notify a colleague of an urgent matter?  Warn the entire department to cancel the event?  Tell your partner about the new venue?  With the new SMS module, you send SMS messages to system users and external recipients much faster and easier. <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/A56B3E157FEFA440.png" alt="image"><br>  In addition, there will be no financial confusion.  Now you can choose from which account to send an SMS message - from a personal or organization account.  The owner of the organization, administrators, as well as users who have ‚ÄúSMS‚Äù access in the organization window can send messages from the organization‚Äôs account. <br>  To speed up the process of sending SMS will help and auto-signature in messages.  You can choose one of the sender's signature options - Prostoy.Biz, a confirmed phone number or an organization signature.  The signature of Prostoy.Biz is set by default and is available to anyone who has funds in their personal or organization accounts.  If you want to use a phone number as a signature, confirm it with the appropriate button on the left pane of the new SMS message window.  The organization's signature can be set in the contact information window of the organization. <br>  <b>Save time - send SMS messages to multiple users at once.</b> <br>  To do this, in the phone number entry field, which is also a search field, enter the numbers in the international format, and then press the ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù button. <br>  Or use the "Contacts" button, where you can select one, several recipients or a whole group.  The numbers of users or contacts that are in the organization of the sender and in the group ‚ÄúMy friends‚Äù are available. <br>  You can send SMS messages at simple rates: 1 p.  for SMS in the CIS countries and 4 p.  - to other countries. <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/D538F1358C15DAD2.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Integrated IP telephony has appeared in ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù; now you do not need to connect a separate account to make calls.</b> <br>  Now you can make external calls from ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù without the need to connect any IP telephony accounts.  Our program now has its own telephony with favorable tariffs ( <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/doc/kp_calls-sms.pdf">tariffs for telephony</a> ).  You can use for incoming our number with the extension of your organization or order a separate number.  Telephony features: call recording, call history, conference, call forwarding (including to a cell phone number), voice menu, rules for handling incoming calls, setting up extensions, access rights to making outgoing calls. <br>  If you already have a SIP telephony account, you can, as before, connect it to the system. <br>  In version 1.8.0.0.  Another useful feature in the telephony module appeared ‚Äî the possibility of transferring a line to a hold during a call.  Now you can forward the call to the right employee or confirm the information while holding the call.  To do this, use the button to the left of the user icon.  When the button is pressed, the sound is muted, and the other person does not hear anything. <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/37866EC5479DC771.png" alt="image"><br>  In connection with the release of the updated SMS and telephony modules, we launched an action for April: 2000 p.  as a gift to telephony and SMS when ordering the tariff "Professional Organization" for 3, 6 or 12 months.  Hurry to use, because  The number of gift bags is limited. <br>  <b>Communicate with customers and partners live - use the new video call feature</b> <br>  Now you can always talk with a colleague, client or partner, as they say, face to face, without even leaving the office or downloading additional programs.  To use the video call option, just press the corresponding button when making a call in ‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù.  Video calls will work if both users have webcams installed.  Please note: video calling is available as part of the ‚ÄúProfessional Organization‚Äù and ‚ÄúVIP Organization‚Äù <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/1602.html">tariffs</a> ( <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/1602.html">more about tariffs</a> ). <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/5BF5E2A51B6B0F20.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Now, each employee sees only his part of the client base - a function of access control by rows in the CRM table has appeared</b> <br>  Do you want to restrict the access of some employees to certain records so that important information does not ‚Äúleak‚Äù from the company?  Now you can configure access not only to the columns in the table with the client base, but also to the records.  To do this, in the table settings window, just go to the "Rows" tab. <br>  The "Your records" field displays records that you are the author of (i.e. that you added).  To open access to a record for an employee, simply add it to the rule by clicking on the ‚ÄúAdd‚Äù link.  The "All records" field displays those users who have access to all records in the table.  In the ‚ÄúPrivate rules‚Äù field you can create rules for displaying records in a table according to certain parameters from a drop-down list (for example, by region of residence, gender, etc.). <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/DE2BFC354E556950.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Get visual statistics on accounting - updated appearance of the module "Accounting"</b> <br>  Now you can immediately see a summary of the accounting information for the day thanks to statistics on the main page of the Accounting module.  In addition, the module got a "convenient" for the perception of the design.  In the new version, invoice payment is made from the ‚ÄúDocuments‚Äù window, from where you can add invoice payment. <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/60D50905AFD6B115.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>Install the program quickly and easily - a new installation wizard in the metro-style has been launched, the program has a new beautiful screensaver, the top menu of the main window has changed for more rapid access to the necessary functions</b> <br>  Now install the program "Simple Business" on your computer has become even easier.  The metro-style installation wizard includes only three installation steps. <br>  The program's screensaver has changed - now it is also made in the metro-style. <br>  The items for quick access to the most frequently used functions are added to the top menu of the main program window.  Rebranding has also touched an animated picture that shows a connection with the server: now instead of a red and blue butterfly there is a two-color Rubik's cube. <br><img src="http://file.prostoy.ru/C2F9F825DBBFC351.png" alt="image"><br>  <b>‚ÄúSimple Business‚Äù continues to work on improving the program - <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/register/">do not miss</a> our messages on how you can use innovations for the benefit of your business.</b> </div>
