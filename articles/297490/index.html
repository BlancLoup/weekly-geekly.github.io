  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Feigned pity: the deputies decided not to close the Russian media for hiding foreign funding</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For hiding the fact of financing from abroad, the media are now facing fines.  Such a bill was adopted by State Duma deputies in the third reading.  This measure primarily concerns the Russian media with foreign co-owners.  The initiative was supported by 434 deputies, one abstained. <br><br>  Officials will be fined 30-50 thousand rubles, and legal entities will be required to pay an amount equal to or twice the amount that the media received from abroad and concealed.  Penalties for re-hiding funding amount to 60-80 thousand rubles and three or four times the amount of funds, respectively. <br><br>  In November, the bill was passed in the first reading.  According to the document, the publisher and (or) the editors of the media within 30 days from the receipt of money or other property from a foreign state, an international organization, as well as organizations under their control, foreign legal entities, citizens, stateless persons, citizens of Russia who have citizenship of another States must notify Roskomnadzor. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Under the action of innovations are not covered by advertising.  The law also does not affect foreign media offices.  For re-concealment of foreign funding, it was proposed to close the media, but this provision was removed from the later versions of the draft law. <br><br>  The relevant committee of the State Duma has softened the bill on media reporting for funds from abroad.  Reports are needed once a quarter, not monthly. For their absence, the media will not close, no need to report on the funds for a subscription. <br>  The new version of the bill is softer than the original, <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/rbcfreenews/567975bb9a79470bf03f4382">told</a> RBC chairman of the committee Leonid Levin.  Now it is proposed not to close the media by the court for repeated violations of the statements.  In addition, the media will not report on foreign subscribers, as well as the sale of content to foreigners. <br><br>  The media will also not be accountable for transactions with those who have both Russian and other citizenship.  The media created by international treaties with Russia, such as the Mir TK, will also be freed from notification.  In the revised version, the minimum amount (15 thousand rubles) is also entered, the receipt of which will need to be reported. <br><br>  At the same time, the deputies expanded the list of sources of funding for which the media are obliged to report: now they have included non-profit organizations recognized as foreign agents in Russia.  Also in the list are foreign organizations or Russian, but whose members are foreigners. <br><br>  According to the new amendments to the <a href="http://base.garant.ru/10164247/">Law</a> ‚ÄúOn Mass Media‚Äù, since January 2016, foreigners are prohibited from directly or indirectly owning more than 20% of any Russian media.  Therefore, now foreign investors can either leave the Russian market or reorganize the business so that it meets the new requirements. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297490/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297490/</a></p>
