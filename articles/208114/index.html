I'll tell you today in the framework of the topic of the article, how I spent New Year's Eve.  Not only tell, but also show pictures.  Very exciting was the action.  Well, it all started like this.  After installing and configuring the home mini-server, the mother wanted a computer for herself.  Like, I'm worse.  I want to read information on the Internet, type texts and the like.  I thought and thought and thought up. <br><br>  Once upon a time I read an article about thin clients.  What can be configured old machine - Intel i486, pentium I, II and similar for normal operation: watching videos, surfing the Internet and so on.  It sounds fantastic.  But it's true.  You can do this shamanism.  This requires a powerful server and client (in my case, it turned out to be Intel Pentium MMX 200 RAM 64Mb 2MB Video and without HDD). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/683/58d/ab2/68358dab2e7a7417abf6fc77b35d0797.jpg">

      In general, it was before the new year.  This design would be a good New Year's gift to mom.  I decided for a long time not to postpone it.  For a computer, it was necessary to buy some kind of stuff: a new keyboard and mouse.  Do not laugh, but the keyboard does not release the AT-package.  On vintage boards, this is a DIN-5 connector.  It looks like a plug from an old tape recorder.  You can connect a ps / 2 mouse there, there are special pins for this on the motherboard. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And I also bought a keyboard ps / 2.  And he managed to make friends with her AT-body.  For this, we had to bungle the adapter.  I took the cord from the old non-working AT keyboard, the ps / 2 connector was sawed off from the idle motherboard.  Half an hour later, the following happened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/97c/50c/3af/97c50c3aff801f30fd3a4c580aa5c296.jpg"><br><br>  Everything!  Now you can use an optical mouse and a new keyboard with an old computer.  Parts were all in place.  It remained to perform the sacrament for setting up a server for this miracle.  In order for this old stuff to work, you just had to install a so-called LTSP server.  Those interested can read about this project on the wikipedia page <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTSP">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/LTSP</a> <br><br>  The operating system on my server is of course GNU / Debian Linux.  Seventh version (stable release).  Let's go, as Yuri Gagarin said.  At first it was necessary to bring the server part to mind.  Using remote access to the machine via ssh, I installed the packages necessary for the operation of the LTSP miracle. <br><pre><code class="bash hljs">apt-get install ltsp-server-standalone</code> </pre> <br>  All necessary packages were pulled, including DHCP server and TFTP.  Yes, you have to configure them in one.  Out of the box nothing works.  It is necessary to finish it with a file to the condition.  And now the promised dances with tambourines have gone.  This is a common thing in the "red-eyed".  These dances continued throughout New Year's Eve.  So I was not bored.  I have not even watched TV for the whole evening. <br><br>  I was waiting for the good news.  You do not need to configure TFTP, it wound up on its own.  Basic settings need to be made for DHCP.  It will distribute the network addresses to the machines and thanks to it the subsequent network loading via TFTP will occur.  A configuration file was found at /etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf.  My file looks like this: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">authoritative; subnet 192.168.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 { range 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.250; <span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#      option domain-name "paulo737.pp.ua"; #     option log-servers 192.168.0.1; # ip    option domain-name-servers 192.168.0.1; #   option broadcast-address 192.168.0.255; #   option routers 192.168.0.1; #   next-server 192.168.0.1; # get-lease-hostnames true; option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0; #   option root-path "/home/ltsp/i386"; #    LTSP- filename "/ltsp/i386/pxelinux.0"; #      }</span></span></code> </pre><br>  A couple more changes needed to be made in the / etc / default / isc-dhcp-server file <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">DHCP_CONF=/etc/ltsp/dhcpd.conf INTERFACES=<span class="hljs-string"><span class="hljs-string">"eth1"</span></span></code> </pre><br>  Everything should be clear here.  Specify the location of the configuration file for the DHCP server, listen to requests from the local network on the eht1 interface.  After these simple actions you need to restart the dhcp server <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">/etc/init.d/isc-dhcp-server restart</code> </pre><br>  It remains to configure the import file system ltsp-server.  Add a line to the / etc / exports file <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">/home/ltsp/i386 *(ro,no_root_squash,async)</code> </pre><br>  You can create a working environment for clients. <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">ltsp-build-client --base /home/ltsp</code> </pre><br>  This is a procurement system into which thin clients will be downloaded via the network.  To configure this system, you need to enter the chroot-environment: <br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">ltsp-chroot</code> </pre><br>  And then it went and went ... apt-get install and the right packages. <br>  Restart the nfs server and ready. <br><br>  Now it's up to small.  You need to prepare a client computer for booting over the network.  This will help the next site <a href="http://rom-o-matic.net/gpxe/gpxe-1.0.1/contrib/rom-o-matic/">rom-o-matic.net/gpxe/gpxe-1.0.1/contrib/rom-o-matic</a> .  Prepare the image for download.  I chose an iso image.  I recorded it on a CD and now I load it with a CD / DVD drive. <br><br>  And ... lo and behold!  On an old computer, you can see the following.  Let me remind for those who have forgotten.  It does not have a hard disk and RAM is only 64 (sixty-four) megabytes.  Not to be confused with gigabytes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cfd/43b/0de/cfd43b0de5d809d5455c070c9dd81589.png"><br><br>  These are the adventures on New Year's Eve) The computer is ready and waiting for a brand new monitor.  Not a bad combination of rare technology with new technologies.  This, of course, is not a Google Nexsus tablet ... but still.  Good luck in the new year and in setting up GNU / Linux.  See you again on the pages of my blog.  Leave your thoughts, comments and tips. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/208114/">https://habr.com/ru/post/208114/</a></p>
