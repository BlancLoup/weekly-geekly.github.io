Many quite rightly fear this word - after all, it takes time and money, it requires knowledge of the theory and direct hands in practice.  We will not help you with any of the above in this article, but we have prepared for you a small selection of tools and all sorts of things that definitely will not interfere with your repair process. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/288660/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7af/71d/9e4/7af71d9e4e3343ec888b80662d26d0ac.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Just say that this is not a digest of wall chasers and pipe benders: choose such tools yourself, depending on the tasks, needs and financial possibilities (and taking Chinese power tools is sometimes unsafe) - we will talk about various trivia that will be useful for almost all repair.  And yes, it is primarily about home repairs, and not repairs, for example, a car or a broken tablet. <br><br><h2>  Mastkhev </h2><br>  <b>1. Laser rangefinder, also known as "laser tape measure"</b>

      This tool is useful to you right from the very first minutes - to measure all the dimensions of the room and understand how much where and what you need to buy, what will fit and what where - no.  The principle of operation is simple: turn on the ‚Äúlaser pointer‚Äù on the device and direct the beam to the desired surface - after pressing the button, the measurement result will be displayed on the display.  In our store a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/laser-rangefinder-electronic-distance-meter-c_11382/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">huge selection of devices in</a> this category - they differ in measurement limits and additional chips. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/296/983/17a/29698317a5d3460093afa0f505bf8742.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  And there are plenty of chips: logging of results, arithmetic operations with them, measurement of angles, areas (including triangles) and volumes, measurement of distance differences, built-in levels, flashlights, lights, and even cameras, wear-resistant bodies and much more.  If you are worried about the accuracy of the readings, then we will calm down: the error of even the cheapest devices is on average ¬± 1 mm, and this is much more accurate than if you were tormented by the traditional tape measure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/81d/340/278/81d340278e367c9fd6aad84ba7da1e3f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If you call workers for any jobs, then with a probability of 99.99% they will have such a device.  The converse is also true - if they do not have such a device, it may be worthwhile to look for other workers.  Because all masters use this tool in their work, because it is fast, accurate and convenient.  Most likely, the possibilities of even the simplest model are enough for you - for example, like this <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/laser-rangefinder-electronic-distance-meter/pp_366164.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">KXL E40 Laser Rangefinder</a> for 970 rubles (measures at a distance of up to 40 meters).  <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/laser-rangefinder-electronic-distance-meter-c_11382/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">More interesting models</a> (with additional features and measuring <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/laser-rangefinder-electronic-distance-meter/pp_469582.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">up to 100 meters</a> ) cost $ 30- $ 60. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd9/50a/747/dd950a7474184032a6b406d608aaa204.jpg"></div><br>  By the way, in conventional retail stores these devices sell for 5-10 thousand rubles (and Leica is not shy about taking from 19 to 90 thousand). <br><br>  In the end, this device can always cheer up your favorite cat: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3af/025/a40/3af025a40ab7ebe3c9642c13e9d717ac.jpg"></div><br>  <b>2. Laser cunner</b> <br><br>  Another tool, without which no major repair now begins.  It is foolish to deny the presence of the advantages and convenience, which gives such a device.  Put a special device on the tripod, press the button and voila - a thin laser line is projected on the desired surface.  Align this line (or lines, crosshairs) in the right place and begin to perform the conceived work: whether it is determining the highest point when filling the screed, installing floor lights, erecting or marking the walls, leveling something.  This is as convenient as the guides in Photoshop.  In essence, a rip fence replaces a whole mountain of tools, including level, plumb, square, and even rule.  The error is small - about a millimeter per meter of projection. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42b/87d/8fa/42b87d8fa72fb8d6853540f0f795447e.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  The minimum required set of functions is the automatic alignment of the horizon (there is almost everywhere due to the freely fixed plumb line) and the projection of the beam at least 180 degrees.  While more expensive models project the beam to 360 degrees, which is also very useful.  Another criterion that determines the cost of the device is the ‚Äúlong range‚Äù of laser beams: simple tiller shine by 10‚Äì15 meters (and this is enough for a home), more expensive ones by 20‚Äì25.  In addition to the osepastoiteli there are laser levels that ‚Äúbyut‚Äù for 50 meters (and rotational levels - for 100 meters or more) and have higher accuracy, but for the house it is all redundant. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/777/a85/a88/777a85a88b0ab064b7a6bbbaabcd2b00.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  In Russia, even for the simplest, tselpostroiteli ask for from 8,000 rubles, while more functional models from brands like ADA cost 20-30 thousand.  We still have three devices in our store: <a href="http://longyun/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Longyun</a> (on <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/testers-detectors/pp_293841.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">2 lines for 2,650 Nr</a> , for <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/testers-detectors/pp_293842.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">3 for 3146 Nr</a> and for <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/testers-detectors/pp_293843.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">5 for 3578 Nr</a> ), <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/testers-detectors/pp_293837.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Lomvum SPY-03</a> (4212 Nr) and <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/testers-detectors/pp_293834.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Lomvum SPY-03 Enhanced</a> (5,405) Yes, they do not know how to project lines 360 degrees, but even with them you can perform many works more accurately.

Non-contact temperature meter (infrared thermometer or pyrometer)</b> <br><br>  The operation of the device is based on measuring the power of thermal radiation of the measurement object mainly in the ranges of infrared radiation and visible light.  The device is useful not only in the repair: it is actively used by doctors to measure the temperature of patients, used by enthusiasts to monitor the temperature regimes of all kinds of hardware and other 3D printers.  If we talk about repairs, then it will not interfere here either: for example, after installing a heating radiator, you can check the ‚Äúuniformity‚Äù of its heating.  Well, or the temperature of the walls and floor in the winter, the temperature of the wires under load or machines in the shield.  And if we talk about auto repair, then there is much more that you can measure :) <br><br> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/temperature-instruments/pp_443155.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/551/7eb/dd0/5517ebdd0175bc6e3fb7b8797b3c6562.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Models - an <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/temperature-instruments-c_11385/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">enormous number</a> , the price as for a business lunch.  The measurement range of the average pyrometer is from -50 to 550 degrees (an error of about 1 degree), other features appear as the price increases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a96/15b/65e/a9615b65e2676471f02a3532bc14d2a4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For most cases, the simplest model is enough, such as the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/temperature-instruments/pp_482093.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Non-contact Digital IR Infrared Thermometer</a> GS320 for ¬£ 51.  And if you want something at once more, then instead of a couple of dinners you can take <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/temperature-instruments/pp_443155.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">such a device</a> , <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/temperature-instruments/pp_415979.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">such</a> or <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/temperature-instruments/pp_332218.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">such</a> .

Digital caliper</b> <br><br>  Surely each of you has an ordinary caliper, which you still got from your grandfather - a nice piece of iron with sharp edges that your grandfather always tried to protect from you :) A lot of time passed since then, and the tool has not lost its relevance - it is somewhere , and in repair it will definitely come in handy: measure drills, wire sections, fittings, etc.  And for convenience, we offer you a digital caliper, the main convenience of which is that it displays the measurement results in large numbers on the display.  Only 269‚ÇΩ and at your disposal a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/hand-tools/pp_189799.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">small digital caliper</a> (for objects 10 cm), the error of which is 0.2 mm. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b1/8ed/b3c/1b18edb3c418760658bbde7d823cc259.jpg" alt="image"></div><br>  <b>5. Points</b> <br><br>  If all previous devices were for measurements (and measurements and markings, as a rule, take a lot of time and largely affect the final result), then I would like to complete the MUSTHAVE section with protective glasses - something without which it would be better not to get involved in the repair.  In OBI and Leroy Merlin stores for plastic glasses, for some reason, they are asked for 500-1000‚ÇΩ, while at us they cost a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/other-tools/pp_592194.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">little more than a dollar</a> .  Buy 10 pieces at once - in the car, in the garage, 5 pieces for repairs (they will suddenly break down or friends will come to help), you will not regret.  Take care of your eyes, they will still be useful to you. <br><br> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/other-tools/pp_592194.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4c/87e/e25/c4c87ee25604487ebc4c851326f82d2d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h2>  Useful stuff </h2><br>  <b>1. Stripper - a device for stripping insulation from wires</b> <br><br>  If you decide to do an electrician yourself, then definitely such a device as a stripper will be useful to you - to remove the insulation from the wires.  And do not need these old-fashioned "yes, I clean the knife perfectly."  Strippers are different, for different types of wires and for different sections, but most of the time in home repair you will clean conventional sockets and various weak points - even the simplest stripper, like this self-adjusting <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/other-garden-supplies/pp_612428.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17">Wire Stripper Tool</a> for 670 rubles, is suitable for this.  This, of course, is not Knipex, but just believe that even this piece of hardware for $ 11 will save you a lot of time and nerves (while just one Stripper from Knipex will cost you all the devices from this post combined). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"> <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/other-garden-supplies/pp_612428.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg17"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/33e/d8d/5ca/33ed8d5cadaedef2202fe7abcb35e282.jpg" alt="image"></a> </div><br>  If for electrician work you hire a master, and he cleans the wires "in the old-fashioned way", then chase him.
