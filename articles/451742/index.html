Announcement of free broadcast</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yg/t0/pp/ygt0ppwb_azieergvbrspfhqu2y.jpeg"><br><br><p>  May 15, that is, tomorrow, the conference DotNext 2019 Piter will be held.  These are two days of reports on the present and future of the .NET platform, performance optimization, details of the internal structure of the platform, architecture, solving unusual problems and so on. </p><br><p>  The total number of reports at the conference is 31. Of these, you can watch the first day reports on YouTube for <strong>free</strong> , which are held in the first hall - 5 pieces.  In the same online broadcast will be an online interview between the reports.  What kind of reports - discuss under the cut. </p><br><p>  The broadcast will begin at 9:45 am (Moscow time), in 15 minutes the opening will begin, and it will end closer and closer to 7 o'clock in the evening.  It is not necessary to open the link at 9:45 am - the link will work all day, so you can open it only on the most important reports. </p><br><p>  Link to the broadcast site - under the cut.  There is also a brief description of the reports and a discussion of a couple of things that will not be broadcast (even if you bought an online ticket). </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2 id="gde-brat-translyaciyu">  Where to take the broadcast </h2><br><p>  The broadcast page is waiting for this green button link: </p><br><p></p><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="400" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/aa/qt/3g/aaqt3glurqc8l4ug4itzcdyrhou.png"></div><p></p><br><p>  In the presence of a video player and the program of the first hall.  The player will come to life only in the morning of May 15th. </p><br><h2 id="programma">  Program </h2><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bcf/f93/d30/bcff93d30153e0ab4c686c40f52c6cc4.jpg">  Dino Esposito, <strong>"ASP.NET Core 3.0: State of the art"</strong> .  New ASP.NET - framework defining the standard for the coming years.  It will focus on architectural issues that need to be considered for building robust solutions on the Microsoft technology stack, including not only the backend and frontend, but also related issues like caching, security, status checking, configuration, and so on.  Dino is our most active speaker, speaking at absolutely all DotNext and conducting the very first keyout of the first Moscow DotNext. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6b8/0a9/6d5/6b80a96d5ffd4f44d3b7ade1aaf46ac0.jpg">  Sean Farmar, <strong>"Successfully decomposing your monolith</strong> . <strong>"</strong>  Sean is working as an architect in the development company NServiceBus and in this report he is going to make a thorough analysis of the practices of the transition to microservice architecture.  On the example of a vertical cut of a simple application, things like DDD, SOA, loose coupling and so on will be dealt with. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b58/9db/1b7/b589db1b7f855a3af27aa436c7db2c99.jpg">  Dmitry Ivanov, <strong>"Async programming in .NET: Best practices"</strong> .  Dmitry is the developer of ReSharper core in JetBrains.  With the advent of async / await, deadlocks and flights have not disappeared anywhere - they just became harder to diagnose.  Based on experience and observations, Dmitry will tell you about the correct and incorrect patterns of writing asynchronous code. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a10/c12/341/a10c123414609ae8d53a19c573542abd.jpg">  Evgeny Peshkov, <strong>‚ÄúMultithreading in .NET: When Productivity Is Not Enough‚Äù</strong> .  Eugene is developing a cloud infrastructure in the company Contour.  The talk will deal with errors and problems of using multithreading in .NET.  Examples are considered when using tools from the .NET standard library (Task.Delay, SemaphoreSlim, ConcurrentDictionary) leads to performance drops, specific particular solutions are offered, .NET is discussed under the hood. <br clear="all"></p><br><p><img width="200" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d9/ed8/4e6/1d9ed84e6d95accc5a024e6153dcc0b6.jpg">  Konstantin Gustov, <strong>‚ÄúDDD in microservices: complexity versus complexity‚Äù</strong> .  DDD is a complex approach, but when there is a lot of confusing business logic, supporting it without such approaches turns into hell.  Konstantin is an architect at Raiffeisenbank.  He will tell the story of the successful implementation of two complex methodologies in the banking environment. <br clear="all"></p><br><h2 id="chego-ne-budet-v-translyacii">  What will not be broadcast </h2><br><p>  Something will not get into the broadcast.  Some things require you to be physically at the conference venue so that you can comfortably communicate, share something, and so on.  Let's give some examples. </p><br><h3 id="trek-soobschestv-dotnetru">  Track Communities DotNetru </h3><br><p>  Within the framework of the conference, the All-Russian .NET-communities association DotNetRu will conduct its own track.  All the details are <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/jugru/blog/450712/">in a separate habrapost</a> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i5/io/yu/i5ioyuhgalwbmhci-jwsvve7wwc.jpeg"><br></p><br><h3 id="diskussionnye-zony">  Discussion areas </h3><br><p>  After each report, the speaker goes to a dedicated discussion area, where you can talk with him and ask your questions.  Formally, this can be done in a break between reports.  Although speakers are not required, they usually stay much longer - for example, for the duration of the next report.  Sometimes it makes sense to skip the report from the main program (if you bought a ticket, you will still have records after filling out the feedback) and spend it on focused communication with an important expert. </p><br><h3 id="vystavochnaya-zona">  Exhibition area </h3><br><p>  In addition to the discussion areas during the break, you can visit the exhibition area.  There are several main activities: </p><br><ul><li>  The exhibition is a zone of stands of partner companies of the conference.  You can learn about interesting projects, technologies and teamwork leaders of the IT-industry.  This is the place where you and the company can find each other.  Please note that there will be representatives of companies that you will not meet face to face with every day. </li><li>  Demo Stage is a dedicated stage for sponsors and partners, where companies make their reports, share practical experience and sum up the draws.  The program can be viewed on the website if you <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D451742">go to the section with the program</a> and set the ‚ÄúDemo Stage‚Äù switch to the appropriate position. </li></ul><br><h3 id="dve-bof-sessii">  Two BOF sessions </h3><br><p>  BOF is now a traditional format at our conferences.  Something like a round table or discussion group in which everyone can take part.  This format historically goes back to the first informal <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birds_of_a_feather_(computing)">discussion groups of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)</a> .  There is no division into a speaker and a participant: everyone participates on a par. </p><br><p>  Currently, <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/party/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D451742">two topics are</a> planned: <strong>‚Äú.NET Core‚Äù</strong> and <strong>‚ÄúFuture of ASP.NET‚Äù</strong> .  ASP.NET BOF is conducted only in English, calculated on the English-speaking participants. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/222/da0/ecf/222da0ecf2cdcf2c68a8377584ffc8e9.jpg"><br></p><br><h3 id="vecherinka-s-pivom-i-muzykoy">  Party with beer and music </h3><br><p>  In parallel with the BOFs, a party starts at the end of the first day.  Drinks, snacks, music - all at once.  You can chat in an informal setting and discuss everything.  You can move from bof to party.  You can move from a party to a bof. </p><br><p>  As in the fall in Moscow, the participants will <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/vagifabilov/" class="user_link">enjoy a</a> live performance from Dylan Beatty, Vagif Abilov <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/vagifabilov/" class="user_link">VagifAbilov</a> and Maxim Arshinov <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/marshinov/" class="user_link">marshinov</a> with covers of rock hits, original songs and original IT versions. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba9/f9d/4c1/ba9f9d4c18c2423483d8745f6f260c16.jpg"><br></p><br><h2 id="kak-dobratsya">  How to get there </h2><br><p>  If you suddenly decide to come in live, just in case, we remind you that DotNext 2019 Piter will be held at the Congress Park Pulkovskaya Park Inn at Victory Square, 1. The nearest metro station is Moskovskaya, exit to the airport.  Entrance to the congress center <strong>from the street Galstyan</strong> . </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a55/0da/fad/a550dafadd7d2e449e67c6da4efff3a1.jpg"></p><br><h2 id="pamyatka-uchastnika">  Member's memo </h2><br><p>  All details about the venue, the registration procedure and many other useful things are available in the participant's memo, which is always <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/participant/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D451742">available on the site</a> . </p><br><h2 id="sleduyuschie-shagi">  Next steps </h2><br><ul><li>  If you are watching a free broadcast: you need to <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/onlinefree/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D451742">follow the link</a> on Wednesday, May 15th.  The broadcast will begin around 9:45 am Moscow time. </li><li>  If you want to get access to all reports and records after the conference: you need <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/buy/online/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D451742">to purchase an online ticket</a> . </li><li>  If you change your mind and go live, all possible options - <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/registration/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D451742">by reference</a> .  Today is the very last day when it can still be done. </li></ul></div>
