In our article we will try to explain why this happens. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Perhaps it was inevitable that programmatic buying (programmatic buying advertising) will rush into the mobile.  Indeed, the volume of mobile advertising is growing rapidly every year, and programmatic, according to <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/blog/2015/06/the_growing_investment_in_mobile_programmatic/">forecasts,</a> will amount <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/blog/2015/06/the_growing_investment_in_mobile_programmatic/">to</a> $ 20 billion by the end of 2016.  And there is no indication that this growth rate will decline. <br><br>  And yet, quite recently, many marketers doubted whether the mobile programmatic could work normally.  Marketing programmers who understand software programs, of course, realized the unique possibilities of effective targeting on mobile devices, but in general, the lack of cookies in the mobile, was perceived by some as insurmountable difficulties.

      <b>Marketers are lagging behind in understanding mobile programmatic</b> <br><br>  Technology uncertainty perhaps explains why some marketers underestimate the power of mobile programmatic.  The Interactive Advertising Bureau's (IAB) recently released <a href="http://www.iab.net/media/file/IAB_Marketer_Perceptions_2015_Final.pdf">Perception of Mobile Advertising by Marketers</a> , which surveyed more than 200 marketers and found that three-quarters of them believe that mobile programmer is very important, or at least deserves close attention. and study. <br>  But what is most surprising, only 27 percent of the surveyed marketers actually benefit from the purchase of mobile advertising shows in a software way. <br>  The good news for the programmatic industry, and for all marketers in general, is that all the technical difficulties of targeting in mobile programmatic are a thing of the past! <br>  Different solutions appeared to solve the problem of the lack of cookies in the mobile: registration input, app SDK, and behavioral data in the mobile Web, here are just a few of them.  And if you add a ‚Äúcherry‚Äù in the form of accurate geo-targeting to this magnificent cake, then it becomes clear why it is necessary to master this direction for every marketer. <br>  So, without risking it, you can say that when IAB publishes its survey on mobile advertising next year, the percentage of marketers who buy mobile advertising will be much higher.  EMarketer agrees with this in its forecasts, which claims that by the end of 2015, mobile programmatic will account for more than half of all automatic advertising purchases, and it will exceed desktop placement. <br><br>  <b>Real mobile programmatic features</b> <br><br>  Why eMarketer and dozens of others foresee such a rapid growth of mobile programmatic?  On the one hand, Brands who have had great success in using desktop programming marketing software simply cannot ignore mobile devices if they want their advertising to reach their current and potential customers. <br>  Next year, it is expected that the number of people around the world who use smartphones will exceed 2 billion, and it is no secret that we are spending more and more of our time at the screens of our phones and other digital devices.  In other words, the use of mobile programmatic is very important for marketers who want to keep up with the times, in the way that people choose to interact with new technologies. <br><br>  But to use mobile programmatic, only in order to keep up with new trends, it means to miss all the new opportunities that can be provided by a smart targeting system on mobile devices. <br>  Brands can collect much more accurate and broad information and behavioral data about their customers, from mobile devices, than from stationary computers.  The data collected using the mobile is more complete and complex.  The speed and thoroughness of their use may be critical for obtaining the desired conversion. <br><br>  And this is really only the beginning of what is possible to implement using mobile programmatic.  Maybe most marketers are aware of the new opportunities that open up with accurate geo-targeting, but not all of them are ready to use it at full power.  One of the successful cases of our company was attracting customers to the store in the Shopping Center, based on accurate geo-targeting of local residents.  Knowing all the current and future benefits of mobile programmatic, you will understand what a truly ‚Äúhot‚Äù trend is in the marketing world. <br><br>  The conclusion is fairly obvious - or at least it should be: Mobile programmatic will play a leading role in more efficient interaction with customers.  Information that we can get from registration data, mobile applications, web-based behavioral data and, especially, from geo-location gives us a more accurate picture of client interests and preferences. <br>  It is surprising the number of marketing specialists, especially in our country, who are not yet aware of this new reality.  And when these marketers and decision makers wake up, the growth of mobile programmatic can really hit us! <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292244/</a></p>
