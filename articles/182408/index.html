Moreover, the views of boys and girls are different ;-) Therefore, I want to share my female look at the Highscreen Boost ‚Äúbrick‚Äù. <br><br>  My first look at this smartphone was full of bewilderment.  After all, this is strange: with a fashion for large, thin, light phones, it produces a large, thick (14.2 mm) and heavy (185 g).  Well this is a whole brick, like the ancient Nokia 9300!  But with each new look, the degree of bewilderment decreased, and surprise grew. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/24f/a80/df8/24fa80df8e23ef7d642c76ca0f508e96.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It is not always necessary to indulge in fashion, which dictates that girls should walk with thin and elegant phones.  Technical characteristics of the tubes can be any, if the case is white and preferably with strass.  Why, and most importantly - to whom they should, is not specified.  And if a lady likes a brutal black smartphone, it's time for her to fix something at the conservatory.

      I declare a protest.  Any woman with an unpretentious mindset is able to get along with a heavy, thick and not at all ‚Äúmimicking‚Äù phone like Highscreen Boost (I‚Äôve spent almost 4 years with the Nokia N95 8Gb bricks and I don‚Äôt mind it! If I hadn't broken, I would have walked. ...) But provided that he has some important feature that distinguishes him favorably from the rest. <br><br><h4>  <b>the main thing</b> </h4><br>  Here it is (feature) is.  The incredibly powerful 4,160 mAh battery leaves far behind my Samsung Galaxy S III (2,100 mAh), and even the Motorola RAZR MAXX (3,300 mAh), which is so much loved to give as an example of longevity. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a47/db5/228/a47db5228b4447023a003ffa0eff34a5.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, the scale of such a battery exceeds the capacity of an average case with a thickness of 8-10 mm, and it does not affect the weight in the best way.  But let - thin, light and much more expensive smartphones on the market a dime a dozen, but with them you can approach the outlet every day.  Otherwise - sit without communication (it is especially offensive when you have another hour to get to your home, and the phone has sat down - not even play anything or read a book! Pechalka!) <br><br>  In two days of active use, I managed to land the battery by as much as 38% (in the screenshot, it says 50 minutes because I had to remove the battery and remove the SIM card).  The daily menu included an average of: <br>  - half an hour of talk, <br>  - a dozen SMS, <br>  - an hour of playing Need for Speed ‚Äã‚Äãor Subway Surfers (actually, I'm not a fan of games, but for the sake of a test ...), <br>  - about three Wi-Fi (hour of surfing, the rest is in standby mode), <br>  - Some photos <br>  - half an hour of Skype. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b20/7d2/f9f/b207d2f9f70b640223459bfa6e0a29dc.jpg"><br><br>  That is, the smartphone screen burned for about three hours a day at medium brightness.  The display, by the way, also unexpectedly pleased: this is a 4.3-inch IPS from Sharp, quite bright and contrasty for use in direct summer sun.  You can only find fault with the resolution: 540 x 960 pixels, by today's standards, is not enough.  But the grit even when watching a video is almost imperceptible.  Although, still 4.3 inches is not enough for me ... after the Samsung Galaxy S III ...;)) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/021/543/fd2/021543fd2208d86884f8320fc111351d.jpeg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e6/e62/e31/9e6e62e31ef5957421e7008457a7a61e.jpeg"><br><br><h4>  <b>Equipment</b> </h4><br>  Upon closer acquaintance with Highscreen Boost, I was quite surprised at its quite modern ‚Äústuffing‚Äù.  It is worth not anyhow what a weak, but energy-saving processor, but quite voracious, powerful dual-core Qualcomm MSM8225 Snapdragon S4 with a clock frequency of 1.4 GHz.  Otherwise, I would never see any races. <br><br>  You can imagine how many days Boost would have lasted with a weak processor and a 3-inch screen!  However, it is possible that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe "eternal android" will be realized in the near future.  Dreams Dreams‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Gigabytes of RAM is good too, thanks!  For data, 4 GB is left, and this, as Masha would say from the cartoon about her and the bear, is ‚Äútasty, but not enough.‚Äù  So add to 8,990 rubles ($ 280) for a smartphone another thousand ($ 30) on a 32 GB microSD memory card - and still you will not go beyond the psychological framework of 10 thousand.  It's nice, anyway. <br><br>  Highscreen smartphones have a funny feature - it is drawn and written on the box where the processor, gyroscope, GPS module and other insides are located.  There is no practical benefit from the anatomical details, but it is possible to show knowledge in the company of friends, for example. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa5/a38/f76/aa5a38f76a84074f8588fd395a2b3449.jpg"><br>  The photo was taken by the built-in camera without flash. <br><br><h4>  <b>Camera and sound</b> </h4><br>  The main camera is an 8-megapixel camera with LED flash, autofocus and lots of different settings.  The camera module is located directly under the bevel of the case, so that you can capture your own fingers in the photos, as long as you adapt properly to hold the device. <br>  The quality of the pictures can not be called excellent, although the best stage is called "Super."  However, for daily shooting such a camera is quite suitable. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5f2/d20/b72/5f2d20b72713606df9f66cae88bbf20b.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ac2/b60/e23/ac2b60e231eedea26b47c60275f0babd.jpg"><br><br>  The videos are quite good, for a pocket camera (yes for that kind of money ?!), the quality is decent.  The maximum resolution is 720p (1280 x 720 pixels). While shooting, you can take photos by tapping the screen. <br><br>  The third mode of the camera is to create panoramas, and in an unusual way: do not take several photos in succession, but slowly take the camera along the object.  I would say that this is a whole art, and a caricature: a rectangular synthesizer in each case turned into a smiling one.  On the other hand, it's fun! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/308/fcb/c93/308fcbc936d7051ec3655df83ee7a494.jpg"><br><br>  But the sound in Boost pleasantly surprised.  True, it is better not to listen to music through the speakers or the complete droplet headphones ‚Äî the impression is ambiguous.  But in high-quality headphones, the sound only falls short of Sony audio players. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8a0/6f3/59b/8a06f359be72dbee87a6247ede5b1b83.jpg"><br><br><h4>  <b>In work</b> </h4><br>  In the section "Information about the phone" expectedly saw "Android 4.1.2".  This is a good answer to those who are against smartphones with quiet names - for them, they say, there are no updates, and the software version is not the latest. <br>  The new Android is also contributing to the energy savings, albeit small.  Also, I didn‚Äôt notice absolutely no brakes when playing videos from YouTube in 1080p resolution (1920 x 1080 pixels), and even resource-intensive games go great with maximum settings.  Skype also works great for which a decent 1.3-megapixel camera was found above the display.  In many much more famous smartphones, a very modest "eye" of 0.3 megapixels is installed. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2e3/9ad/ebc/2e39adebc3a64eaaa81483d708cb2852.jpg"><br><br>  In Highscreen Boost there are no additional programs besides the standard set.  But it fully supports Google Play, so the choice is almost limitless. <br><br><h4>  <b>Appearance</b> </h4><br>  External inspection of the smartphone, I specifically left last, because it is - not his main feature.  However, it is not entirely correct to call it a ‚Äúbrick-and-brick‚Äù: the brick has no bevels behind it so that it is more comfortable to hold.  Yes, and the "dotted" surface of the back panel is the privilege of Boost, and not the ancient heavy phones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9db/c37/834/9dbc378344937f48495bfc1c1edb71d9.jpg"><br><br>  Convex stripes are located on the sidewalls, in which, with careful tactile examination, a volume control (on the left), power buttons and cameras (on the right) are detected.  The buttons are separated from the non-functional part of the strips, it is convenient to press them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c55/75b/79d/c5575b79daa14bdafdad4cd1d0286a6f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/372/f14/045/372f14045015240bd8af5f831f487646.jpg"><br><br>  At the top there is a standard headphone jack, at the bottom is a microUSB for recharging. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d1e/649/acb/d1e649acbc2b938a141cfacc1d9db161.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6db/d2c/b83/6dbd2cb836976b238428eb46520d0094.jpg"><br><br>  Slots for memory cards and SIM-cards are hidden under the battery.  Yes, this is a two-part model, and an unusual one: WCDMA + GSM is written on one slot, only GSM is on the second slot.  The radio module is one, like all two-sim smartphones. <br><br>  Build quality pleased - nothing creaks and does not play.  The hull looks solid, but I wouldn't drown it or throw it away. <br><br><h4>  <b>Impressions</b> </h4><br>  Heavy big smartphones usually look rustic, but Boost is an example of how you can find a bicep under a modest appearance ... sorry, a dual-core processor and a powerful battery for five days, or even a whole week.  A good screen, the latest version of Android, and a pleasantly low cost are also excellent. <br><br>  Another bonus is the warranty.  If something happens to the smartphone, a specially trained courier will arrive and pick it up for repair.  Excellent customer attack "Vobis Computer" against the "gray" supply of unknown Chinese pipes that have nowhere to repair! <br><br>  Among the shortcomings (besides the ‚Äúnon-female‚Äù design), I would note, nevertheless, an average quality camera and a low screen resolution.  Well, penny complete headphones.  Frankly speaking, there are few minuses, but I would have forgiven all this for the opportunity to put on charging less ... if I was a guy: D))) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182408/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182408/</a></p>
