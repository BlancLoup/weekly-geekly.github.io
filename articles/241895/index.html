  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to make a selling card product for an online store</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Immediately we warn you - this article is not about the fact that you need to use the red button ‚Äúadd to cart‚Äù on the item card, which will increase the conversion by 20% and that the photo size of the item should be 500 by 500 pixels and this will raise the conversion by 10%, and the size of the header should be typed in 10 size, that's when your products will be sold.  There are no simple recipes and secrets.  There is truth in it.  But the truth is that it is not enough to read the article about the buttons and colors to create a selling page with the product.  To create a really selling page you need to make a lot of effort and to a lesser extent, these efforts are associated with the choice of colors, fonts and buttons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/544/d14/dcb/544d14dcbcebbdbc15c0fae3f9ce2273.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is necessary to understand that the main thing on the product card page is content.  And even if all the elements are located on Feng Shui, and the colors psychologically contribute to the purchase (as many studies indicate), it will not sell if there is no content on it: product photos, descriptions, delivery terms, etc.  Therefore, the article will discuss what content should be on the item card.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Product Photos </h2><br>  It is already difficult to imagine an online store without photos of goods, but the less such stores are found, especially in the regions.  Here are some examples: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/876/432/870/87643287062447541d350203086711aa.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There are no images like in the catalog. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/902/590/5e5/9025905e5eac53e50e707ed345458241.png" alt="image"><br><br>  So on the item card.  If you can still buy nails or screws without seeing how they look, then with a lamp it is hardly possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d83/e60/ee5/d83e60ee5ac720371a1523ea0ff7bb08.png" alt="image"><br><br>  A photo of a product is an obligatory element on the product card, while it is not there, do not even think about other content.  This is the basis. <br><br>  If the store is small, then you can take photos yourself.  There is always an option to take images from catalogs or from the manufacturer‚Äôs website, but these are extreme options.  The best thing is to create content yourself. <br><br>  Have you downloaded a couple of product images?  Good.  Here are some recommendations for photos of online stores: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Show photos from different angles</b> .  For most products, one photo is not enough.  Take a photo from different sides, or, for example, in 3D-mode. </li><li>  <b>Show the goods in use</b> .  If these are clothes, then take photos on the person.  If you sell kitchen utensils, take a couple of photos in a beautifully decorated kitchen interior.  For sellers of jewelry, watches, jewelry, it is important to show products on the person, so that the user can see what size the watch is in relation to the hand or how big the earrings are.  Few people look at the description of the size of the goods in the characteristics and few people will substitute a ruler to their hand to understand the size of the clock.  As a result, the client will either order and remain dissatisfied with the product and return it, or leave the site. </li><li>  <b>Take a video about the product</b> .  If you think that shooting a video about a product is too expensive, then think about this: how much will it cost you to shoot one video review of a product?  How much will this increase the value of your online store in the eyes of the client and the conversion on your site?  Yes, you can not make a video about a product, but spend this money on the advertising budget to attract more and more traffic, but in fact you need to work with content and product to increase its value.  Here are some examples of online stores that use video on the product card.  Online store 6pm.com shoots video reviews of goods.  This can be compared with personal selling, since on the one hand the product is shown in the video, and on the other there is a person who talks about the product and its advantages, and actually sells the product. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/401/aef/540/401aef540e22f5145317262b93dd7b88.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The online store 6pm.com creates video reviews of goods not from a great love of shooting and a lot of free time and money. <br>  They are well aware that such reviews increase the conversion of the site, reduce the number of returns of goods (especially for clothes, in photos it may look quite different than than you). <br><br>  Here is another example of using video on product cards in the asos.com online store: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/09f/f97/74e/09ff9774ef37fe891c3d6649ac9f00c4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  When processing photos of goods, the color always changes somewhat, so you can also see the real color of the goods on the video. <br><br><h2>  Product description </h2><br>  Everyone chooses the goods differently.  For some, technical characteristics are clear and understandable, for someone, what the product looks like is important, for the third one, price is important.  Your task is to answer the questions of all site visitors. <br>  Take 2 examples of the description of the same type of product, for example, a men's wallet. <br><br>  In the online store <a href="http://www.bagandwallet.ru/">www.bagandwallet.ru</a> in addition to photos and videos about the product there is a good, clear description. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/837/050/127/837050127cc03966391341409287761b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  How many cards fit into a wallet?  6-12.  How many branches?  2. What bills are placed?  Any.  In the description of the goods only really important and necessary information for making a purchase decision, no ‚Äúwater‚Äù. <br><br>  Take another example of a commodity card wallet and its description: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d92/073/962/d920739624f3036a7ccddb12eb01d2aa.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Wonderful wallet with a clasp on the button with the brand logo.  There are compartments for coins, credit cards and bills.  Perfectly.  How many cards fit?  What are the bills? <br><br>  Below on the page, of course, there is information about what size the wallet is, but in order to understand which banknotes fit in it, the client needs to measure the banknotes.  Agree, it is not very convenient. <br><br>  Place in the description of the goods only important and useful information, avoid the qualitative adjectives "wonderful", "beautiful", "matchless", "excellent".  Specify in the description of the product only clear characteristics, not abstract. <br><br><h2>  Product Features </h2><br>  As we already wrote above, users choose a product in different ways, so it is important to provide all the characteristics of the product on the card. <br>  The online appliance stores usually have no problems with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/938/1c3/5c8/9381c35c8d11059d8ee97f67f85efe31.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But there are such commodity cards: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/466/6b5/ed8/4666b5ed896ff08b0c12e8dfee6ddfa4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If there is no product description, then it is better not to place the product on the site at all, but rather to spend some time creating the minimum necessary content for the product card. <br><br><h2>  Product Reviews </h2><br>  The fact that the reviews of other people listen and that they affect the conversion has already been said.  We only remind you that this is a mandatory item card item.  But in many online stores reviews, if they are provided at all, look like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b7b/9b4/4cb/b7b9b44cb071a1175e59266b2f15d7ee.png" alt="image"><br>  Therefore, we will give some tips on how to ask for feedback from customers: <br><br><ul><li>  After buying the product, contact the customer, asking him to leave feedback about a particular product and the store as a whole; </li><li>  Do not remove negative reviews about the product.  If your online store receives negative reviews about products, this is not a reason to remove such reviews - this is a reason to think about the quality of the goods you sell and to revise the product line; </li><li> Thank your customers for the feedback - it can be a simple "thank you", and maybe a gift.  You decide; </li><li>  If you have a small store, then you can talk with the customer in person to get feedback.  This is an excellent practice and in order to understand which aspects of your service need to be improved. </li></ul><br><h3>  Reviews can be funny and memorable. </h3><br>  Here's a review from online store amazon.com on TV for $ 199.999.99 <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d91/b00/651/d91b0065197590cef7d4073c7ec7515c.png" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5a/fa0/f05/e5afa0f05532f0af5d1b4e074e704917.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>‚ÄúI‚Äôve been able to pay for a loan (30 year fixed-rate w / 4.25% APR) and only 3.5% down.</i>  <i>This is a hands down, the best decision I've ever made.</i>  <i>"It is a hugely roomy, too, because I live in it now."</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄúI managed to buy this TV thanks to a 30-year loan at 4.25% per annum with a down payment of 3.5%.  This is by far the best solution in my life.  And along with this TV there is a big box in which I will live now ‚Äù. <br><br>  And here's another <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Samsung-UN110S9-Framed-110-Inch-Ultra/dp/B00L403O3A/ref%3Dsr_1_1%3Fs%3Dtv%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3Dundefined%26sr%3D1-1%26keywords%3Dtv">review</a> on an expensive TV. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúPurchased this TV for my island retreat.</i>  <i>Watch it like to come watch like ‚ÄúThe Shrinking Middle Class‚Äù, ‚ÄúIncome Inequality‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Ever Widening Wage Gap. Have to say, wow what a picture!</i>  <i>Watching the 99% of movement is amazing. ‚Äú</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄùI bought this telly on my island.  I mainly watch comedies like ‚Äúendangered middle class‚Äù, ‚Äúincome inequality‚Äù, etc.  I must say the picture - just a delight.  Watch as 99% of the population are trying to survive in the UHD-quality - indescribably! ‚Äù <br><br>  And the last <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mens-Black-Fox-Fur-Jacket/dp/B003VP4K9I/ref%3Dsr_1_4%3Fs%3Dapparel%26ie%3DUTF8%26qid%3Dundefined%26sr%3D1-4%26keywords%3Dfur%2Bcoat">review</a> from Amazon on a fur coat for $ 5,999.95 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/56a/b21/739/56ab2173963f210fc10f82e438444437.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>‚ÄúI‚Äôve taken a shot at the British Earl.</i>  <i>I thought I was looking like a Black Fox.</i>  <i>A super fly, gorgeous fox albeit.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>When I‚Äôm looking for a caretaker. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  ‚ÄùGot a shot charge lower back from a passing British Earl mime.  I don‚Äôt have to blame him, I really looked like a black fox.  Doctors say that I will never get back on my feet, but when you have such a smart fur coat - it doesn‚Äôt matter. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  Warranty, delivery, return, payment </h2><br>  A product card is essentially a landing page for a user who has come to purchase a specific product.  That is why it should give all the necessary information for making a purchase decision. <br><br>  Such information includes: <br><br><ul><li>  conditions and cost of delivery of goods; </li><li>  product warranty; </li><li>  terms of return; </li><li>  payment options. </li></ul><br>  As a rule, such information is located on separate pages on the site, so in order to see it the visitor needs to leave the item card. <br>  To convince a visitor to make a purchase, such information should be located exactly on the item card (and duplicated on separate pages). <br>  Here is an example of the implementation of the location of such information in the online store apple-ru.ru: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a72/602/a6d/a72602a6df78db6b06509fc0fc14055e.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Information about guarantees, delivery, refund is located under the header of the site, in the form of icons with links to pages with detailed information.  In addition, below on the card there are tabs ‚Äúdelivery‚Äù, ‚Äùpayment‚Äù, ‚Äùguarantee‚Äù.  Those visitors who do not need detailed information on the terms of delivery will put the goods in the basket and proceed to checkout.  And those users who thoroughly study all the conditions of the online store before buying, first visit the pages with this information, and then return to the product card, if all the conditions of purchase are acceptable to them. <br><br><h2>  Product recommendations and products for upsell </h2><br>  Another important element on the product card is product recommendations.  Take care that the user does not think about what additional accessories are needed for the purchased product. <br><br>  For example, when buying a phone, the buyer may need: <br><ul><li>  film; </li><li>  case; </li><li>  extra battery. </li></ul><br>  For example, in the holodilnik.ru online store for a microwave oven, there are 29 add-on products to choose from: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4cd/964/5a3/4cd9645a35b3b67b49df4399681abc82.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The audience that comes to the product card of your online store from search or advertising may come to buy a certain product, and may be at the stage of choosing between several products, so you need to provide replacement goods or products for up-sell on the product card. <br><br>  Here is an example of the implementation of a block of recommended products in the ASOS online store: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/107/2ca/080/1072ca080bc8ab8146eb1fa4a253f837.png" alt="image"><br><br>  For those visitors who are not sure about the choice of the current product, there is an alternative - look for similar products on the right. <br><br><h2>  Dry residue </h2><br>  So for the merchandise card to sell, it should have the following content. <br><br><ul><li>  qualitative description of the goods, without "water", with a description of the useful properties of the goods; </li><li>  photos of good quality goods from several angles; </li><li>  Review of the goods.  Not necessarily, but can significantly increase conversion and reduce costs for returning goods; </li><li>  product specifications; </li><li>  reviews; </li><li>  information about delivery, payment, guarantees; </li><li>  links to related and recommended products; </li><li>  links to products that complement the product. </li></ul><br><h3>  Several additional chips on the item card </h3><br>  There are several additional chips for the product card page. <br><br>  So, it often happens that the product is sold out, and the product card remains in search results.  As a result, the visitor enters the page, and the product is not available.  On these pages, you can make a button "Report on sale".  Here is an example of the implementation of such a chip in the online store Mango: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/54c/7e8/b70/54c7e8b709990b80d6f6c7011493d968.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This service is only suitable for stores that have returns of goods and the receipt of new products that were not previously available. <br><br><h3>  Report price reduction </h3><br>  Another service that can be implemented on the item card is informing the user about the reduction in the value of the item.  Not all visitors coming to your site are ready to buy goods at full cost.  This is especially true of clothing sales, since most retailers arrange seasonal sales and visitors know about it.  Therefore, in order not to lose contact with the visitor, you can notify him of the decrease in the cost of the product in which he was interested. <br><br>  Here is an example of the implementation of such a service: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d3/571/5ab/2d35715ab257a27059932bf057d8f876.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Add to favorites </h3><br>  A fairly common service, but we still say a few words about it.  Buying a product can be impulsive, and can be thought about for several days or even several weeks.  Therefore, it is important to provide the ability to save the product that the user liked. <br><br>  In the list of saved items, you can use 2 more chips: <br><br><ul><li>  show notifications that the selected items are not in stock; </li><li>  show discounts on stored goods. </li></ul><br>  Here is an example of such an implementation: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/222/396/5b9/2223965b9b0025fca7ec55f62aa659b4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This is convenient for the user, you can see on which products the price has dropped and buy them.  And for an online store - this is an additional tool of persuasion to purchase. <br><br><h3>  Compare Products </h3><br><br>  The more complex the product according to its specifications, the more difficult it is to select it.  Especially in conditions where there are many similar products with a slight difference in price.  In this case, it is necessary to implement the product comparison function.  See how it is implemented in the online store mvideo.ru <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2c1/f48/bb0/2c1f48bb0fe0afbf5587d21a6f43ac26.png" alt="image"><br><br>  All differences in the characteristics of goods are highlighted, which greatly facilitates the selection of a particular product by the user. <br>  It is important to remember that such a function is needed for online stores with a large product range; for small online stores, it will not be useful. <br><br>  And which content is the most important for you and how do you see the perfect product card? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241895/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241895/</a></p>
