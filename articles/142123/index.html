"YouDo exists since 2009". <br>  Partly true, since the first version of the project called YouDo was launched more than three years ago.  During this time, many changes have happened, but I would like to touch on the story later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0a2/cb3/1fb/0a2cb31fb4f475d15a4586987c64653d.png">

      And now about the new YouDo <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  1) About the idea and problem </h4><br>  The essence of the project is to provide a convenient tool with which the user anywhere in the world can quickly solve any problem.  For this, he creates a task, deposits the amount he is willing to pay, and within a few minutes he can receive dozens of lucrative offers from people who are nearby.  Further, in a few clicks, the customer chooses the best offer (price, rating, reviews).  After completing the work, the customer completes the task and leaves a review.  Money is transferred to the account of the artist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e9f/2f8/334/e9f2f83343ed118c633bd9896f1c7e91.png"><br><br>  Examples: <br>  - Buy products in the store and bring home <br>  - Deliver and assemble a wardrobe from Ikea <br>  - Clean the apartment and wash the windows <br>  - Repair, customize appliances <br>  - Any courier tasks, etc. <br><br>  People do not even imagine how much around those who are ready to perform similar tasks and earn money on it.  This is a problem of any metropolis, where one part of the inhabitants does not have free time to solve household or business problems, and the other does not know how and where it is convenient to earn extra money for their qualifications. <br><br><h4>  2) About the process </h4><br>  At the end of 2011, we decided to restart YouDo on a new model, by that time the site was already under construction.  A timeline was drawn up with the steps necessary for a successful restart. <br>  It turned out about the following: <br>  1) <s>Create a prototype</s> <br>  2) <s>Collect indicators</s> (conversion to payers, average check, ARPPU, etc.) <br>  3) <s>Build on the basis of indicators and analysis of the financial market.</s>  <s>model</s> <br>  4) <s>Attract</s> investments <br>  5) Exit beta and provide job insurance <br>  6) Run on mobile platforms <br>  7) Go to major cities in the markets of the CIS, Europe, BRIC. <br><br>  The search for investors began immediately and led in parallel with the development, setting a goal by all means by the middle of the year (this was the last option) to have at least a signed agreement of intent.  It turned out that in three years of work we learned a little how to make presentations, build business models and communicate with investors).  That helped. <br><br><h4>  3) Users and security </h4><br>  With the involvement of customers, everything was approximately clear how and where to look for them - there was experience (tests with traffic showed clear numbers and volumes), but with the performers everything seemed more complicated.  These people can not be issued in the state, and to make high-quality and reliable service with a person from the side is more difficult. <br><br>  However, we managed to find a convenient and inexpensive way not only to attract performers, but also to verify them.  Save and verify the authenticity of passport data, the owner himself - for the presence of criminal and administrative offenses, unpaid loans, etc.  With us, this process is actually no different from checking clients at any bank in security services.  In addition, the performer must pass an interview on their qualifications, show recommendations from work, etc.  If everything is OK, then after a day the user receives a special icon on the site and can begin to participate in local tasks. <br><br>  The security system, fraud controls and possible frauds, both on the part of customers and on the part of performers, were thought out for a long time.  Now we are preparing for implementation.  Later, we plan to insure all the tasks additionally, automatically generate receipts for the categories related to delivery, etc. <br><br><h4>  3) Competitors </h4><br>  American TaskRabbit is the closest on the model (in total, it has already attracted more than $ 25 million).  I created the first task on it in 2008 (it was then called RunMyErrand), the project changed a lot and for a long time I was looking for my model, honed the mechanics.  There is still a very young, but sensational Zaarly (attracted more than $ 8 million), although he recently turned in the direction of selling goods, rather than performing tasks.  There is an old-timer of the RadBacon market (he won TechCrunch 50 back in 2009 and attracted more than $ 5 million), although this is more of a fancy bulletin board with reverse mechanics, which has many clones during this time.  In general, there are about two dozen interesting projects in the USA, which now, to varying degrees, are conducting experiments similar in mechanics to us. <br><br>  In Russia, everything is just beginning, lately I have seen about 5 projects that announced something similar.  For the most part, the market is divided between bulletin boards, recruitment agencies, domestic staff and services of paid assistants. <br><br>  <b>About the differences.</b>  <b>I will give a couple of plates.</b> <br>  Here is a comparison with the main players of the market for offline tasks. <br>  <i>(sorry for partial translation, pulled out in a hurry from our presentation).</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a38/8f1/7cc/a388f17cc5a2c23d87c18ae4ec8d4471.png"><br><br>  This tablet is not at all on the strengths of YouDo. <br>  If we talk about them, the tasks like " <a href="https://youdo.com/tasks/7633">Bring hot coffee from Coffeemania</a> " nowhere else, except on YouDo, can not be solved for a couple of minutes after registration. <br>  Feedback from people speak for themselves. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/423/824/eca/423824eca814a583d0ecf9fb7237e8bc.png"><br><br>  Here is a comparison of the example of a specific job with YouDo - " <a href="https://youdo.com/tasks/7674">One-time cleaning in a 1 room apartment</a> ." <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e1b/129/205/e1b1292052b3f0a66255768b0aa5c760.png"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  There are services that break the foundations and habits, they swing for a very long time, turn around a lot, but in the end one of the hundreds has a huge impact on the market and people's lives.  At one time, hh.ru killed hundreds of recruitment agencies, providing a convenient opportunity for companies to solve personnel issues on their own.  In hh, they didn‚Äôt come up with anything new, they just made a convenient search and interaction with a huge resume database directly. <br>  We also do not invent anything new.  Bulletin boards have long proved their need for the masses of people.  We just want to show how to solve problems in a new way: more convenient, faster and more reliable.  Adding verification and gamification, which can not give online ads;  efficiency and mobility that a recruitment agency cannot provide;  system of reviews and ratings, as significant as on eBay, but only for the market of small services. <br><br>  The global goal of the project is not just to connect customers and performers, but to make these people freer.  It does not matter what kind of freedom it is: a new influx of finances for performers or freedom by saving time in the literal sense of the word for the customer.  We do not set fast targets, we want to do business with users who believe in what we believe. <br>  And we sincerely believe that now YouDo creates a projection of how the work of the future will look.  We believe that after 2-3 years the market for small services will be controlled by geolocation crowd services, and the growth of mobile traffic will inappropriately transfer it to mobile platforms. <br><br>  Denis Kutergin, <br>  CEO YouDo <br>  den@youdo.com <br><br>  <i><b>PS</b> I will be very grateful to you for suggestions and ideas, it is still difficult for us to look at the service from all angles, to fight skeptics and the status quo, but nothing inspires as the opinion of people who believe in the idea.</i>  <i>We are getting more and more!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>This year, a special project will be organized on YouDo RIF + CIB, where everyone can test YouDo free of charge during the conference, I will tell you a bit later.</i>  <i>I will be glad to meet and talk at our booth.</i> <i><br></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142123/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142123/</a></p>
