M.A.Bonch-Bruevich.  Deliveries are made according to the scheme 1 to 1 learning (‚Äú1 student - 1 computer‚Äù).  University.  Bonch-Bruevich became the first Russian university working under this scheme. <br><br>  Last week at the University of Telecommunications.  Bonch-Bruevich during the opening of the reconstructed corps freshmen received 6 thousand Apple MacBook laptops. <br><br>  The ‚Äú1 student - 1 computer‚Äù training model was first proposed by Apple in American schools and universities, and has become widespread over the past few years.  In educational institutions equipped under this program, there is an increase in the motivation and personal involvement of students in the learning process, the growth of academic performance and the effectiveness of the educational process. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The supplier of laptops for the university has become the company "DPI-computers", previously participated in such educational programs.  ‚ÄúThe pilot project was deliveries to Europe‚Äôs largest‚Äú School of the Future ‚Äù(School No. 2030, Moscow), which received about 1,200 Apple MacBook computers in 2007 to support the educational process.  But for a higher education institution, a project of this scale was implemented for the first time, ‚Äùnotes Mikhail Zaydfodim, General Director of DPI Computers. <br><br>  In addition to Apple, Intel has long been involved in delivering computers to Russia.  This year, the manufacturer plans to supply 2.5 thousand laptops to schools in the Gorky, Novosibirsk and Yaroslavl regions.  ‚ÄúDespite the technical equipment of Russian schools that has improved in recent years, there is still not enough modern technology, especially computer technology that is fully functional and optimized for the educational process,‚Äù said Dmitry Konash, regional director of Intel in the CIS countries. <br><br>  Comment. <br><br>  Short conclusions: Apple is becoming increasingly popular.  The educational project has reached Russia.  St. Petersburg once again confirms leadership in the field of science, education and IT. <br><br>  Reflections: 6000 laptops handed freshmen, it's good.  But in addition to technology, an infrastructure is needed that will effectively use it.  And the thinking of students and teachers should be restructured, radically modified.  And all this is under the flag of Apple.  In iTunes U there is a video about the implementation of the educational program in one of the colleges.  In addition to the beech, the student has an iPod, on which most of the educational material is listened to.  COMNEWS doesn‚Äôt tell us anything about this, so I think: the infrastructure is under construction, raw, so it‚Äôs too early to talk about it.  Students will probably buy iPods by themselves.  And there are no sources of funding for this wonderful project.  Is this budget money?  Or the obligation of freshmen, or rather their parents?  Or are there generous sponsors?  There is no answer yet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39548/</a></p>
