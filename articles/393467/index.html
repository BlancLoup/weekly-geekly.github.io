  <section class="page js-page"><h1>No time for geeks?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you remember how Linux was created?  There was a golden time: no one was looking for investors, did not make beautiful prezi and video clips, did not hold endless meetings and meetings, did not even create deadline schedules and kanban boards.  Only 20 years have passed, but that era seems to have gone irretrievably and marketers and sales managers have come to replace the true geeks in the world of information technology.  Today we speculate why this is bad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c78/541/9cb/c785419cbe0494d99980d15ac8ad4423.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In sports, for example, it is simply impossible to start winning, without dreaming every second to become the best of the best.  If initially, from the first workout, you can count on your career only for something, then you just have to sell yourself a great uncle at a higher price, as soon as possible to please someone who once knocks on your dressing room with a wad of money and points out - in which round and under whom to lie, then simply never and there will be nothing: no victories, no recognition, no money.  In IT today I see a similar situation, when people, before creating the first mocap, dream not about the final quality and recognition of their revolutionary product, not about conquering the market, not about their place in history - but about how and when Google or them will buy them will call Zuckerberg.  Needless to say, with such a defeatist logic, I personally did not initially expect success and breakthroughs from previously surrendered projects.

Geek talks about the current product, and sales manager speaks of a new round of investment.  Geek is ready to work on a truly worthwhile project at night, and today's typical IT specialist requires prepayment. <br><br>  Here, for example, in the world there are already a huge number of services for reviewing the finished design: when notes, comments, assessment judgments from the Customer are superimposed on the final Artist.  However, this does not prevent all new and new peers from successfully searching for investors and languishing in the sweet expectation of transferring millions to their current account.  If, during this expectation, it is proposed to introduce a function in the project that will be absolutely important and demanded by all designers around the world, but which was not included in the initial slides for the investor, an immediate refusal will follow. <br><br>  Suppose, let's consider the need for a function that once and for all solves the problem of "Infinite Editing."  Any experienced marketer himself is well aware of this situation, when the overwhelming number of users, getting more and more convenient and simplified service of design critics - believe that such functions ‚Äúshoot them in the leg,‚Äù because the convenience of commenting leads to even more comments from side of the customer than it was before.  And so the comments grow exponentially, the terms are flying, the Customer is angry, the studio is at a loss ... We need to give the designer a tool capable of presenting the work so that the client accepts it without or with the minimum number of edits. <br><br>  The solution here has long been on the surface - the edits will grow exponentially for as long as they are free.  As soon as a service appears that is capable of adding to the Customer‚Äôs every comment, immediately add its value, and based on the results of all edits, immediately create an additional template.  contract or invoice for processing - the problem will disappear instantly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ca/35b/d15/9ca35bd158b42de7b02ff117a516e87e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  How can this be implemented in practice?  When downloading a new design and preparing a link, the Designer may add certain properties to each future comment: price, mandatory link to analytical materials, a screenshot of the brief, and so on.  Now the reviewer's addition of a comment without confirming the property set by the Designer will (under certain established conditions and at a special rate) be no longer possible.  The simplest thing in general is a proposal that can solve the problems of thousands of web studios and freelancers around the world once and for all.  Any geek would happily grab onto him, but ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/798/98a/c09/79898ac097bc8b6064d0cb57ab23d39d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But it seems that today all geeks' ears from the IT industry are somewhere else, in new, more modern and freedom-loving distant distances.  For more than two years, the author of this article has been unsuccessfully looking for his companions to the Technical Director of the ‚Äúold school‚Äù, a fanatic of digital technologies and just a man of action who loves to do something with his hands and try the result ‚Äúto taste‚Äù.  It would seem that it could be easier - a techie who wants in the first place: <br><ul><li>  do - and not discuss </li><li>  to try - and not to criticize, </li><li>  measure - not predict </li><li>  perform three different options - rather than wait for the pointer from above, etc. </li></ul><br>  But for several years on one RIFE I never managed to get acquainted with at least one such person, which is a pity. <br><br>  With a real geek, you could literally launch a startup weekly, instantly making a minimal ready prototype and then creating information noise in the appropriate community about the emergence of a service or application that really solves the pressing problem of this particular segment.  If the idea would have been in demand and long awaited by its audience, then ‚Äúinvestments‚Äù in the form of assistance in organizing and finalizing the project, collecting the subscriber base and adding new features, and finishing the functionality would go on their own.  But today everyone needs only a monetization model, long before even the approximate structure and architecture of the project will be known.  Money replaced the process and the result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/151/0bd/518/1510bd5186a4ee4ff0fef62c1c13348c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A mobile application with a check-in queue at the polyclinic ‚ÄúNumber on the hand‚Äù, the site of the temporary exchange of personalities ‚ÄúThe Prince and the Pauper‚Äù, the weather portal with tips from your wardrobe instead of the banal degrees called ‚ÄúDon't Wear‚Äù - and hundreds more ideas have been waiting for years of its hour, that they will be taken one day and begin to shake. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4aa/39a/8b0/4aa39a8b0b652eefd7d9c30905293705.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The queue of information services that are most necessary for people has long exceeded the queue at a regular Russian clinic ‚Äî and there are simply not enough investors in the world to pay millions of each of them: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d9d/9fd/92c/d9d9fd92c1a121fb3073bd4fa345026f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Even 10-15 years ago, on specialized forums, with the help of such geeks, many excellent programs, services, and applications were created.  Now it is difficult to imagine it, but people who did not yet know scram and ruby, without using design thinking and usability skills, in the absence of channels in slack - created history, openly and accessiblely, free of charge and with inspiration helping each other and the world to get into new digital age. <br><br>  Now they are no more.  Today it is impossible to find a person with whom it will be possible to rake out all that pile of unrealized ideas that have accumulated in my notebook for several years.  Quickly test the potential, realize the MVP, listen to feedback, accept the help and support of those who need it for a long time - and do, first of all, DO the right thing, and not sell yourself, don‚Äôt trade the presentation, don‚Äôt dream of raising the round. <br><br>  But a real man‚Äôs round must always be the same: You and Eternity, when you need to adequately withstand all the time allotted to you in the ring against a deadly opponent and provide decent resistance, prompting respect from your own descendants.  Will it be possible to raise the respects of his own son, if all his life in advance is to prepare only for one thing: to quickly lie down at the very beginning of the battle, only having heard the necessary amount from the producer?
