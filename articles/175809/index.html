The previous proposal looks somewhat absurd, because before the summer there are still two months.  But it should be noted that those who like to spend the summer traveling with obtaining new knowledge and communicating with interesting people are already beginning to prepare.  One of the ways that I know, combining the two mentioned ways of spending time, is to visit scientific schools.  And the end of applications for many of them will come soon. <br><br>  The list of schools, including the time of the application, the deadline for applications, the venue and the availability of grants, is maintained in the <a href="http://vk.com/compscischools">group on VK</a> and on <a href="http://compsciclub.ru/schools">the club's Computer Science page.</a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As a person who has visited eight schools in the past two years, I dare to give a few tips and comments.

      I will begin, perhaps, with advice.  If you are going to apply for a school for the first time and are in doubt whether to apply or not, the correct answer is to apply!  At one time, the main excuse for me was - it takes a lot of time.  In fact, to apply for most schools is not.  And even if this is so, then all those documents that you will collect, will be useful to you and then.  In fact, you will need to collect documents once for submitting an application not for one school, but for several, moreover, such documents as a letter of recommendation, you will need if you are going to enroll in a foreign postgraduate program or apply for a grant. <br><br>  What gives participation in schools?  In addition to the knowledge gained from experts in your field, you get a lot of communication with people who work in your or a related field.  It should be noted that attending lectures at schools is significantly different from lectures at the university.  A trip to school is more rest than work, but after such a rest you have useful knowledge and acquaintances.  The main advantage of attending schools is the atmosphere in which you find yourself and the motivation gained from participating in the school.  It is important to note that many schools provide financial support to participants by giving grants.  It often happens that the grant covers all the costs of the participant‚Äôs stay; in this case, the main thing is to get to the conference.  In some cases, there are even road grants. <br><br>  Finally, the happy faces of the participants in one of the schools: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d6/5d3/812/2d65d3812e9b2d1a3adf049001ed8b46.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/175809/">https://habr.com/ru/post/175809/</a></p>
