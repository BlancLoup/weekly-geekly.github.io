  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How not to make a login form in the Internet bank</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This text is published for the sake of one simple goal, maybe someone from the reader will one day realize a similar form and will not allow the described errors, and then users will breathe a little more calmly. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  It so happened that for about two years I have been a Citibank customer and I haven‚Äôt had any significant complaints about it during this time.  At least since their employees stopped getting credit offers, and the site began to perceive Firefox as a browser.  And yet one thing caused and continues to cause a keen desire to beat a little head against the wall.  This thing is a form of entry into an online bank, which I would have spat and resigned for a long time, if not the need to communicate with it once a day, and ... a wonderful banner that appeared not so long ago on the pages of Citibank. <br><br><img src="http://axion-rti.ru/media/epicfail.png" title="handsome" alt=""><br><br>  It would be logical to assume that the ‚ÄúBest Internet Bank‚Äù should have the Best Entry Form to this very bank, in case of emergency - just good.  But let's look at it and go through all the elements. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <img src="http://axion-rti.ru/media/epicfail2.png" title="our patient" alt=" "><br><br><ul><li>  The first thing we see is the lock icon, it does not make sense, alt or title does not, and its purpose is only to be guessed.  Apparently it symbolizes the transition to the protected part of the site? </li><li>  Just below the link "Help", but to be precise - javascript code for opening a new window.  We decided to honor the help in the new tab - it will not work. </li><li>  It is difficult to find fault with the login field, but you can.  Because the label is still worth it. </li><li>  But then the most interesting begins - the password entry field.  Just because there is no possibility to enter into it, the transition to it (thanks for at least the tab works) causes the opening of the virtual keyboard, which is visible just to the right.  And the situation is not standard, the keyboard stubbornly flies into the right corner and it has to be returned back. <br>  Here you should certainly thank the clever people from Citibank who know about such misfortunes as keyloggers, but still ask ‚ÄúWhy not let the user decide for himself what he wants?‚Äù <br>  Well, okay, it would not be the biggest problem if it were not for the terrible work of the keyboard. </li><li>  There is no feedback from the keyboard.  Buttons do not reflect the fact of clicking on them, as a result - constant errors in typing. <br>  You can try to solve this problem for yourself by increasing the keyboard ... but for some strange reason, 30% percent, why it is so much that is completely unclear.  Sometimes the keyboard, for reasons known only to her, closes itself ... </li><li>  The inscription ‚Äúsave Username‚Äù, separated by 2 lines, looks funny.  And why with a capital letter? </li><li>  Let's go further, go down a little lower and see the beautiful inscription "For the first time see this page?".  Ok, I even agree that someone could get on this page by chance, what does this inscription do as part of the form?  And what does ‚ÄúImportant information‚Äù do in this form (by the way, also a javascript link)?  Moreover, the text of important information is almost duplicate of the text placed to the right of the form (under the keyboard) </li></ul><br><br>  As you can see - a sad spectacle. <br><br>  PS <br>  Here I finished writing this long post and tried to log in, but <br><br><img src="http://axion-rti.ru/media/epicfail3.png" title="I'm sorry, what?" alt=", ?"><br><br>  upd.  Gentlemen of anonymous minus, I would be glad to hear from you criticism, and not just to see the minuses of the article. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46028/</a></p>
