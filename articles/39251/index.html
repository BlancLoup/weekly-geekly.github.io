  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What to expect from Google in the next 10 years</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  September 7, Google celebrated its <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/google/39160/">first anniversary</a> .  Not a single corporation in the history of mankind has ever achieved such commercial success in the first ten years of its existence.  It remains only to assume what will happen next and what it will turn into by 2018.  EWeek magazine <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Search-Engines/What-to-Expect-From-Google-in-The-Next-10-Years/">writes</a> about the prospects of Chrome, Android and OpenSocial, as well as about life in the era of the mobile web. <br><br>  <b>War "Chrome"</b> <br>  A day after its release, Google Chrome gained <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/chrome_market_share_first_days.php">1% of the global browser market</a> .  What will happen if more and more users start switching from IE to Chrome?  Journalists and bloggers love to say that Chrome will be an alternative to Windows, but de facto you cannot launch this browser without an operating system. <br><br>  However, webmail, online text editor and other office applications will gain popularity.  Over time, business will also begin a massive transition to Google infrastructure.  Small business started it now.  When large enterprises start being hosted on Google‚Äôs servers, Internet Explorer will simply become irrelevant.  Everyone will use Chrome and Google Docs.

      What happens with Microsoft? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, Microsoft will try to restore the position of Windows, promoting the Live Mesh platform and activating its attempts to conquer the mobile device platform, but, as <a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/web_services_browser/android_dresses_up_in_chrome.html">experts note</a> , the Redmond giant is far behind. <br><br>  <b>Chrome comes to Android</b> <br>  Sergey Brin <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Linux-and-Open-Source/Googles-Sergey-Brin-Denies-Chrome-is-The-OS-For-Web-Apps/">said</a> that Chrome and Android are made for each other.  They have a <a href="http://googlewatch.eweek.com/content/google_vs_microsoft/google_chrome_browser_to_challenge_microsoft.html">common WebKit</a> , and if the same ultra-fast script processing engine is implemented on mobile phones, this will be a real revolution in the field of mobile web applications. <br><br>  This will take Google in the next few years, and not without success.  You can expect a real competition with the Apple iPhone. <br><br>  Nokia and other manufacturers will continue to manufacture mobile phones, but Google applications and the same Chrome will work as software.  The share of Windows Mobile will start to decline. <br><br>  By promoting Chrome and Android, Google will be able to significantly improve the situation with its sources of income, which are now almost 100% dependent on contextual advertising. <br><br>  <b>OpenSocial, YouTube</b> <br>  OpenSocial is becoming an increasingly common technology, as programmers are increasingly using open APIs to create their own applications. <br><br>  From a financial point of view, this technology will not bring profit to Google, but it is important for the consolidation of the user base.  True, in the social media advertising market, Google will not be able to compete with Facebook.  As Google has driven all competitors out of the contextual advertising market, Facebook will eventually push all competitors out of the social media advertising market. <br><br>  Google, however, will take its place in the graphic advertising market.  With her YouTube service, she will begin to eat off this market share from Yahoo (or Microhoo). <br><br>  <b>2018</b> <br>  Actively developing promising areas of Chrome, Android and Google Apps with a highly profitable contextual advertising business, Google is becoming the main provider of web applications, serving both private users and businesses, thanks to a distributed computing platform and stability. <br><br>  However, Microsoft will not give up the position.  Although its presence on the web will remain relatively small, but Windows will improve and, despite media predictions, it will remain the most popular operating system on desktops.  If now she has 85-95%, then in ten years there will be about 60%. <br><br>  However, by 2018 this may not be as important as it is now, since so many users simply will not have personal computers.  By that time, smartphones, including BlackBerry, iPhone and Android, will become so advanced that they can be used as a full-fledged alternative to PCs and laptops. <br><br>  In the end, we will remember 2008 as the first year when Google began to seriously <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Google-Chrome-Could-Nuke-Microsoft-From-the-Internet-Market/">undermine Microsoft‚Äôs attempts to bring its business to the Internet</a> . <br><br>  At the same time, by 2018, Facebook and other sites will threaten Google‚Äôs business in ways we cannot imagine. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39251/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39251/</a></p>
