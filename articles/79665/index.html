  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ubuntu documentation and all</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="http://ubuntu.ru/img/logo-ubuntu-ru.png" alt="image" align="right">  The New Year is approaching, for which so much wanted to realize and do much, but alas, many plans did not come true. <br><br>  Nevertheless, something still happened and was created, sometimes by itself, sometimes with someone's participation.  And, summing up the outgoing year, I would like to touch a little bit on what was done in the very sluggish, but still quite popular project <a href="http://ubuntu.ru/">ubuntu.ru</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  At some point, quietly, peacefully and almost imperceptibly, the resource <a href="http://help.ubuntu.ru/">help.ubuntu.ru</a> appeared from nowhere.  After a rather slow testing, various discussions of the structure and the device, it turned out that everything is fine, but there is one annoying technical problem, and therefore the opening of the resource with fireworks and champagne did not take place. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      But nevertheless, <a href="http://help.ubuntu.ru/">help.ubuntu.ru</a> is in working condition, it even has rules, a structure has been developed, and so on, and even the first independent editors of articles have appeared, apart from your humble servant and a couple more involved activists.  What can not but rejoice. <br><br>  Strictly speaking, I very much hope that in the end it will be possible to attract a sufficient amount of attention to this resource and collect on it a sufficient amount of relevant Russian-language documentation on Ubuntu.  If you are bored with constant scouring on blogs and forums in search of answers to your questions, maybe you will do a good deed and help others by putting the solutions you find on our wiki ?;) Well, as always, personally I really want to hear as many practical suggestions as possible and as much constructive criticism as possible about the resource as a whole.  In the end, it‚Äôs not a lot of work to write your opinion, but I personally am pleased :) <br><br><h4>  Beginner's Guide </h4><br><br>  And finally, at some point I felt that 1.5 complete manuals for beginners specifically on Ubuntu were on the Internet, and they sin with some problems, so in the evening another teaching creation was born over a cup of tea, which you can find on <a href="http://help.ubuntu.ru/manual">help.ubuntu.ru / manual</a> (of course I was drinking tea, not a manual;)) <br><br>  The purpose and task of all this was approximately the following: to write as complete a Ubuntu manual as possible for a user with the least possible use of the console.  That is, I wanted to explain in an accessible form all the features of Linux, but without any dancing with configs and the terminal. <br><br>  I very much hope that in the current form the manual is already fully applicable to real learning, nevertheless, most of all I want to hear suggestions and comments on the merits, for I see perfectly that everything is not good and much needs to be corrected. <br><br>  As an announcement, further plans for the development of all this are approximately as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  First you need to finish the manual page template, fix some screenshots and fill in Orphus.  But realizing this is prevented by problems with hosting. </li><li>  Then in the most immediate plans to make a pdf version of the manual, but here my laziness and my ignorance of LaTeX are interfering. </li><li>  I would very much like to replace the stupid current wiki template with something more beautiful and convenient, at some point even the designer was formed, but then disappeared somewhere, which is a pity. </li><li>  Well, most of all I want good content throughout the wiki.  But here it is not so much dependent on me;) </li></ul><br>  But the most important thing, for the sake of which I actually write this short note, is that if you suddenly accidentally want to help with any part of the site ubuntu.ru, feel free to contact me at least.  For the sake of editing the wiki, you don‚Äôt even need to contact, it is open to all participants of <a href="http://forum.ubuntu.ru/">forum.ubuntu.ru</a> ;) <br><br>  PS By the way, this year Russian LoCo received an official status, the project ubuntu.ru appeared on Launchpad (there is even a bugtracker, well, and the source of which), meetings of various Russian-speaking teams began, etc.  etc. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79665/</a></p>
