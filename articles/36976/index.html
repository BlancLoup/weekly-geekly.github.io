You already know that. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The crux of the matter is that people are outsourcing work to IT centers, like Bangalore, to save a lot of money.  But the problem is that you get a poor quality product at the outlet.  Cause?  You want to reduce costs too much. <br><br>  You will never get work done with high quality at a low price.  Never.  Quality always comes with price.

      If you send work to outsource to another country, always try to find people who promise to make a quality product, and not people who promise to make it very cheap.  In addition, never outsource the ‚Äúcore‚Äù of your product. <br><br>  I am Native Indian and let me tell you some facts: <br><br><ol><li>  Most Indian software companies have a staff of low-skilled programmers. </li><li>  A large percentage (I fear more than 50%) of programmers have a basic education not in the field of programming. </li><li>  They are mechanical engineers, electrical engineers, electronic engineers, civil engineers. </li><li>  At the vacancies currently offered, payment levels are low even in India. </li><li>  We do not care about the quality of the work we do for you.  I don‚Äôt want to throw mud at anyone, but the fact is that in fact no one cares about the quality of the code, which is done for American companies, which they even know little about.  You will receive a quality code only if it comes from the very heart - such as when you are programming for yourself.  Most Indian programmers do not feel any attachment to their companies (mainly because of the way these companies deal with them). </li><li>  Part of the reason why companies hire low-skilled programmers is that outsourcing is very monotonous and boring tasks that have no end in sight.  Many Indian programmers have their own projects, to which they devote their free time, give their soul, and on the quality of the code of which they concentrate their attention instead of taking care of the projects that they do in companies. </li><li>  I do not want to say that there are no qualified programmers in India.  There are many of them, but the chance that they will be hired by large software companies is small due to the proposed payment.  Instead, they recruit mechanical engineers or graduates of second-rate institutes. </li></ol><br>  I think you understand the situation here.  Which exit?  Do not use outsourcing.  Seriously.  If there are monotone parts that do not require high quality, you can use.  But if you want a high-quality product or it is about developing a new version of the flagship product of your company - do not think about outsourcing, otherwise you are doomed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/36976/">https://habr.com/ru/post/36976/</a></p>
