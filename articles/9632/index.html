Everything below is IMHO, considering only your (rich?) Experience. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1 - I believe that this technology applied to digital content violates my rights to the presumption of innocence.  That is, they will recognize me in advance that I will be unauthorized and dishonest to copy content.  That is, not to say we use it in different players, but to share with the whole world or resell it. <br><br>  2 - as a technology to protect the code from forgery at the level of iron in certain conditions - great.  For example, when the firmware of a machine or a workplace of a bank employee is protected from launching unnecessary code.

      3 - this technology is evil in the form it is implemented in Vista, when Mikrosovt periodically checks me for lice and does not allow me to use programs as I want. <br><br>  4 - I do not think that a progressive DRM offensive will lead to the apocalypse described by Stallman in The Right To Read.  Such an apocalypse, fortunately, is not beneficial to all market players (and what the hell, it is not very beneficial to many), which means there will always be those who will deliver software with DRM implemented in a ‚Äúgood‚Äù form, that is, as part of security or as ‚Äúunobtrusive‚Äù ¬ªRestrictions.  Now this is Apple on the part of manufacturers of players and Linux / BSD / Sun / Macos on the part of operating systems.  There will be some balance, as it is now and always has been. <br><br>  5 - I think that what ordinary users will have to pay for everything is a very good thing.  Because then the market will have a controlling influence and people will start to think about what they use and for what.  And now the control action is kind of clumsy because it is very difficult to compete with free Photoshop and WinXP.  The fact of obligatory payment is likely to reduce the user base of the absolute leaders of today's market, since at present people mostly hammer nails with microscopes, and in their opinion these microscopes should be very expensive, of a certain shape and color, but for free. <br><br>  6 - the current DRM offensive - the reverse motion of the pendulum from total piracy, which prepared the ground for total surveillance.  As soon as users begin to feel the real inconvenience of DRM, then immediately there will be those who offer to buy a solution to this inconvenience. <br><br>  7 - Such as it was in the 95-200m year, when there was 1 cheap architecture and 1 OS ‚Äúfor housewives and secretaries‚Äù (and for free!) Will never be again.  Who heard about Linux in 98m?  Who in their right mind bought at 99m Macs?  This means that MS‚Äôs super profits will be at least not over. <br><br>  It also seems to me that what happens to mobile prefixes in terms of launching non-manufacturer-certified code in general-purpose computers will not happen due to the strong dispersal of interests and the number of players.  I hope there will be no total domination of any OSes. <br><br>  In my support I will give the shadows of monsters that were once no less cool than MS.  These are DEC and IBM, well, HP and SUN are a little less oble :-).  And do not say that VAX or OS / 2 were excellent systems - this is your nostalgia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9632/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9632/</a></p>
