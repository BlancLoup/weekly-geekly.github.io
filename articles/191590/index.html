  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ROI Initiative Digest</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The well-known ROI website (Russian Public Initiative) publishes quite a lot of initiatives that remain without proper attention (at the time of the post of 1753 initiatives), although, as confirmed by voting for some initiatives, there are plenty of people registered on public services and having the right to vote on the <a href="https://www.roi.ru/">ROI</a> . <br><br>  Under the cut you will find a selection of interesting initiatives one way or another connected with the IT industry and a small survey.  If you no longer want to see a selection of initiatives on Habr√©, go directly to the vote. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today I will post, perhaps not the most important, but interesting initiatives for the IT community.  If the Habr community supports my initiative, then the next digest will consist mainly of significant initiatives across the country, since only IT initiatives are very few and not enough for periodic compilations. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/infrastruktura-i-vneshnij-vid-goroda/zakon-o-kriptovalyute-bitkoinah/">Cryptocurrency law (bitcoins)</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative suggests legislatively recognizing cryptocurrency (Bitcoins) in the territory of the Russian Federation.</i> <br><blockquote>  - Directly register the cryptocurrency in the law on the "National Payment System"; <br>  - Create the necessary documents for the functioning of ATMs and exchangers; <br>  - Give banks legal opportunities to work with cryptocurrencies; <br>  - Add the code ‚Äúgeneration of cryptocurrency hashes‚Äù to OKVED; <br>  - Provide currency exchange mechanisms for trading cryptocurrency; <br>  - Allow individuals and legal entities to accept payments in Bitcoins. </blockquote>

For organizations with more than 30 employees (Article 58 p.1. P.6 of the Federal Law No. 212-FZ, article 57 parts 2.1), the rate is 14% (Article 58, part 3 of the Federal Law No. 212-FZ), and will persist until 2017.  For other organizations operating in the field of information technology, that is, with a staff of less than 30 people, the rate is 20% (and only if the organization applies a simplified taxation system), and it is valid for the last year (Article 58, 3.4 FL ‚Ññ212-). </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/chinovniki-i-gos-uslugi/predotvrashenie-korruptcii-s-ispolzovaniem-kompyuternyh-tehnologij/">Preventing Corruption Using Computer Technology</a> </h4>  <i>The author proposes on the basis of photographs of corrupt officials to define a ‚Äúblack list‚Äù of psycho-types that are prohibited from holding one or another post</i> <blockquote>  We compare psycho-types to each other, we compare those who are less likely, and those who more often commit crimes, which in turn will make it possible to create a black list of psycho-types, of those who just need to be prevented from this or that position, due to the large number of cases of corruption. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/gosudarstvennoe_upravlenie1/tehnologii-distantcionnogo-prisutstviya-v-ekonomike-kapitalizatciya-i-perspektivy-razvitiya-rossii/">Remote presence technologies in the economy, capitalization and development prospects for Russia</a> </h4>  <i>If I correctly understand the author of the initiative, then it is proposed to develop small cities and settlements, and the population of such cities can ‚Äúgo to work‚Äù using the technology of telepresence</i> <blockquote>  Over the past two decades, information technology and communications have developed at a speed of hundreds of times faster than other industries, and are now able to shape the look of all technology, and therefore the economy, which consists in the possibility of indirect (remote) interaction of workers with the objects of their work and other, determine the forms of optimal distribution of people (as a labor resource) and means of production throughout the country. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/problemy-potrebitelej-i-plohoj-servis/osnashenie-svetoforov-radiomayakami-na-osnove-wifi-tehnologij-dlya-distantcionnogo-informirovaniya-voditelej-transportnyh-sredstv-o-signalah-svetofora/">The equipping of traffic lights with wifi-based radio beacons for remotely informing vehicle drivers of traffic signals</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to equip all traffic lights with radio beacons for remotely informing vehicle drivers of traffic lights</i> <blockquote>  A more reliable and noticeable source of information on the state of the traffic light is needed, thanks to which the driver from afar can determine the phase of the traffic light from a distance, in advance and more accurately.  This is especially true on high-speed sections of highways, in order to prepare in advance for a change in speed limit: start to slow down, or go boldly at the same speed in order to catch the enabling signal. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/obrazovanie_i_nauka/vvesti-prezidenta-ran-v-pravitelstvo-rf-v-statuse-ministra-po-nauke-i-vysokim-tehnologiyam/">Introduce the President of the Russian Academy of Sciences into the Government of the Russian Federation in the status of Minister for Science and High Technologies</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes introducing the President of the Russian Academy of Sciences into the Government of the Russian Federation with the rank of Federal Minister for Science and High Technologies and transforming the Ministry of Education and Science into the Ministry of Education.</i> <blockquote>  The management of science at the state level will be carried out by scientists who, much better than the officials of today's Ministry of Education and Science, understand the real needs of science and ways to improve its efficiency. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/obrazovanie_i_nauka/vvesti-v-obrazovatelnyh-uchrezhdeniyah-obuchenie-pechati-na-klaviature-kompyutera-slepym-desyati-paltcevym-metodom-povsemestno-na-zakonodatelnom-urovne/">Introduce in educational institutions, typing training on the keyboard of a computer using the blind ten-finger method everywhere at the legislative level</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to introduce in the schools (or other educational institutions) ‚Äúblind typing‚Äù training.</i> <blockquote>  Enter in educational institutions, learning to type on a computer keyboard using the blind ten-finger method everywhere at the legislative level.  For training it takes 25-30 hours.  Having introduced the methodology in educational institutions, educational institutions will begin to produce professionals of all kinds who own the 10-finger method (lawyers, doctors, etc.), this is an advanced specialist who works faster, the 21st century is the century of speeds. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/problemy-potrebitelej-i-plohoj-servis/nalog-s-kazhdogo-provajdera-na-finansirovanie-avtorov-knig-i-muzyki-proportcionalno-kolichestvu-skachek-ih-proizvedenij-v-edinoj-elektronnoj-biblioteke/">Tax from each provider to finance the authors of books and music in proportion to the number of races of their works in the Unified Electronic Library</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to create the Russian Unified Public Electronic Library and impose an additional tax on Internet providers in favor of the Russian Unified Public Electronic Library.</i> <blockquote>  Based on the volume of the market of Internet access services for individuals of about 60-70 billion rubles, the total REBE fund will be about 6 billion. If 3 billion of them will be spent on the fees of the writers themselves, then about 3000 authors in an average will receive 1 million rubles.  in year.  This is enough to save the professional environment and create a competitive community. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/initciativy/internet-obsuzhdenie-proekta-ustava-munitcipalnogo-obrazovaniya/">Internet discussion of the draft charter of the municipality</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to organize an Internet discussion of draft municipal charters.</i> <blockquote>  The procedure for holding public hearings, especially on the draft charter of the municipality, is ineffective, since, unfortunately, not all municipalities have their official websites or official press organs.  Also, the current generation of "information technology" rarely addresses the printed source of information or visits the sites of municipalities, young people may not attend such events, fearing to be simply not heard or not taken seriously. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/problemy-potrebitelej-i-plohoj-servis/pravo-na-dostup-v-internet/">Internet access right</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to legislate the right of every citizen to access the Internet.</i> <blockquote>  In the absence of a legally protected right of access to the Internet, citizens are not guaranteed such a right, which means that law enforcement agencies, providers and other persons who may have malicious intent to stop providing Internet access to a citizen at any time can be guaranteed.  At the same time, the speed of data transmission on the Internet today can vary greatly with fixed and mobile providers.  Considering that the right of citizens to get access to the Internet in any way today is not fixed by law, there is no possibility to fix the minimum data transfer rate that the state and providers guarantee to every citizen (except for convicts and other categories of persons with restricted rights). </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/ekonomika/sozdanie-normativnogo-dokumenta-kotoryj-budet-regulirovat-kachestvo-okazaniya-uslug-po-dostupu-k-seti-internet/">Creation of a regulatory document that will regulate the quality of the provision of Internet access services</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to introduce technical regulations that would regulate the quality of the provision of services for access to the Internet.</i> <blockquote>  This will bring order to the provision of Internet access services, will give consumers of Internet services the opportunity to defend their rights, and government agencies the opportunity to protect the rights of citizens and regulate this area. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/initciativy/obyazatelnoe-opredelenie-i-ukazanie-mestonahozhdeniya-uchastnikov-internet-obsheniya-v-blogah-konferentciyah-obsuzhdeniyah-kommentariyah-i-prochih-sotcsetyah-ukazanie-mestonahozhdeniya-ogranichit-stranoj-i-regionom/">Mandatory definition and indication of the location of participants in Internet communication in blogs, conferences, discussions, comments and other social networks.</a>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/initciativy/obyazatelnoe-opredelenie-i-ukazanie-mestonahozhdeniya-uchastnikov-internet-obsheniya-v-blogah-konferentciyah-obsuzhdeniyah-kommentariyah-i-prochih-sotcsetyah-ukazanie-mestonahozhdeniya-ogranichit-stranoj-i-regionom/">Locate restriction to country and region</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to introduce a mandatory definition and indication of the location of participants in social services.</i>  <i>networks and other sites.</i> <blockquote> The practical result will increase the culture of communication on the Internet, will avoid wasting time in meaningless disputes with participants of Internet communication in some cases. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/chinovniki-i-gos-uslugi/ustanovka-veb-kamer-v-kabinetah-chinovnikov-s-vyvodom-izobrazheniya-v-internet/">Installing webcams in the offices of officials with the image output to the Internet</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to install webcams in the offices of officials with the broadcast on the Internet</i> <blockquote>  The people will be able to follow the "servants of the people."  The level of trust in the government will increase due to greater transparency.  The level of corruption will be reduced due to the fear of officials that citizens who control them via the Internet can catch them. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/gosudarstvennaya_podderzhka/deshyovyj-sputnikovyj-internet-dlya-trudnodostupnyh-naselyonnyh-punktov/">Cheap satellite Internet for hard-to-reach locations</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to organize cheap Internet access (300-500 rubles / month) through satellite communications at the expense of state funds for hard-to-reach settlements.</i> <blockquote>  Russia is a huge country, with a large number of people living in hard-to-reach places that do not have access to high-speed Internet.  I propose (with state money) to create and launch a geostationary satellite that will cover the entire territory of Russia with cheap, high-speed Internet. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/bezopasnost/bezopasnost-internet-prostranstva-rossii1/">Protecting the Internet space of Russia from foreign agents</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to create a register of foreign agent sites.</i> <blockquote>  The scenario of the Twitter-facebook Orange Revolution did not pass in Russia, the US approach changed, responding to the challenge - and the investments also increased (the amount of the purchase of e1 is rumored to be about a billion rubles!).  Now the audience of pro-American sites is comparable to the audience of federal channels.  And ideological treatment acquires a completely different scale, frankly dangerous for Russia. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/ekonomika/edinnyj-raschetnyj-schet-dlya-grazhdan-rf/">Unified current account and Internet service for contracting</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to create for each citizen of the Russian Federation a single settlement account through which a citizen of the Russian Federation will be able to perform any financial transactions, as well as create a website through which a citizen can enter into agreements using electronic digital signatures</i> <blockquote>  This account is opened with the birth of a citizen and his number does not change with his whole life, like the number of a passport.  Similar accounts should be provided to legal entities from the moment of their creation until the moment of bankruptcy.  Also, through the site in which a citizen of the Russian Federation manages his account, enable this citizen to enter into agreements using an electronic digital signature.  For example, an employee‚Äôs employment contract with an employer. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/problemy-potrebitelej-i-plohoj-servis/obyazat-kazhduyu-upravlyayushuyu-kompaniyu-uk-tszh-kazhduyu-strukturu-zhkh-imet-svoj-sajt-v-sisteme-internet/">To oblige each Management Company (MC), TSZH, each structure of housing and communal services to have its own website in the Internet</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to oblige the management companies and the HOA to create their own websites.</i> <blockquote>  On the site of the Criminal Code (Homeowners Association), each owner of the living space serviced by this UK or who is a member of the Homeowners' Association must have his Personal Account in which he can view his personal account, check the correctness of charges for utilities provided, indicate the indications of apartment meters for water, gas , light, heat, print a receipt for payment of utility bills, pay utility bills by credit card directly from the site. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/chinovniki-i-gos-uslugi/tcelesoobrazno-otkryt-svobodnyj-dostup-k-dissertatciyam-rgb-cherez-internet/">It is advisable to open free access to dissertations of the RSL via the Internet</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to realize the possibility of obtaining free access to the database of dissertations of the Russian State Library via the Internet</i> <blockquote>  Any graduate student / applicant working on his own dissertation, it is necessary to consider more than a dozen works by other authors to write a decent scientific review and an objective understanding of the current state of affairs in the topic under consideration. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/problemy-potrebitelej-i-plohoj-servis/vvedenie-na-pochte-rossii-uslugi-quot-internet-otkrytka-quot/">Introduction to the RUSSIAN POST OF "Internet card" service</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to oblige the Russian Post to introduce the ‚ÄúInternet Card‚Äù service, which is paid by the user via a bank card via the Internet.</i>  <i>The service would allow sending through the form on the Russian Post website the text on the chosen postcard form.</i> <blockquote>  RUSSIAN MAIL would not have had to ‚Äúcarry‚Äù letters for two weeks and think at night and days away how to reduce the delivery time.  So you can not only send postcards, but also letters.  You do not need to print stamps, special envelopes, sort all this afterwards and send them by any transport. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.roi.ru/poll/petition/ugolovnyj_kodeks/publikatciya-informatcii-ob-ugolovnyh-i-administrativnyh-pravonarusheniyah-v-internete/">Publication of information on criminal and administrative offenses on the Internet</a> </h4>  <i>The author of the initiative proposes to oblige all territorial bodies of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to periodically publish information on the Internet on all registered, accepted for execution and disclosed criminal offenses and administrative offenses.</i> <blockquote>  Bottom line <br>  1.
