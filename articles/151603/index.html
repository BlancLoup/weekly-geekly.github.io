It's amazing how often we have to put up with it.  Here are just a few, literally, the first problems I encountered last week. <br><br><ul><li>  On my iPhone 4s, 3 gigabytes of space is occupied by something that iTunes defines as ‚ÄúOther.‚Äù  No one knows what this ‚Äúother‚Äù is and offers to either completely erase the settings or ‚Äúdelete and add mail accounts again‚Äù.  Actually, this is a problem for me, because the device is only 16 gigabytes! </li><li>  Windows Indexing Service on my desktop has been working for 3 days in a row.  Decision?  Delete and re-create the index.  Handled in just a day. </li><li>  For each person on my iPhone there are 4 and sometimes 5 contacts.  I tied them all, but they still show up. </li><li>  In iMessage, I have one person who writes me and his message is shown from one of three contacts with the same name.  To talk with him, I need to know each time from which of his accounts I received a message. </li><li>  Microsoft Outlook probably never succeeded in ‚Äúcorrectly completing‚Äù. </li><li>  The stream of photos from iCloud should show the last 1000 pictures from all my iOs devices.  Mine shows 734. I have no idea why.  What to do?  Delete, reinstall, stop, start, restart. </li><li>  Where did the mail I sent you go?  Probably hung in the ‚Äúsent‚Äù folder in Outlook. </li><li>  Gmail is now just as slow as Outlook.  They say that you need to check whether some harmful application has received access to Gmail through OAuth.  Checked - there are none. </li><li>  I use Microsoft Lync (corporate chat) on my desktops, two laptops, iPhone, iPad and a couple more virtualok.  A few days ago, two instances of Lync did not get along and started logging off each other, saying, ‚ÄúYou have logged into Lync from several different places.‚Äù  Yeah, like in a joke ‚Äù- Doctor, when I do it hurts like that.  ‚ÄúAnd you don't do that.‚Äù </li><li>  Final Cut Pro crashes when saved, if you scroll too fast. </li><li>  In my calendar in Windows 8 only birthdays are marked.  Hundreds of useless recurring birthdays of people I don‚Äôt even know </li><li>  iPhoto is absolutely useless when you have more than a few thousand photos. </li><li>  About iTunes do not even want to start. </li><li>  And also Skype.  Literally everything about Skype UI.  And especially the resizing of speakers in Skype for Mac. </li><li>  Somewhere after version 19, Google Chrome changed the mechanism for registering itself as the default browser in Windows and broke half a dozen applications (such as Visual Studio) that searched for a specific key in the registry that other browsers installed. </li><li>  I have to give a talk on the Xbox every time I click ‚ÄúClear‚Äù in the iPhone alert box. </li><li>  I have two documents that I wrote in Microsoft Word and that do not open now, because Word says: ‚ÄúThese are not Word documents‚Äù. </li><li>  Three of my favorite sites constantly hang in IE9.  And two more in Chrome.  I can not remember what where. </li><li>  Due to AdBlock, my Gmail did not work for 3 days, yielding javascript errors until I added an exception. </li></ul><br><br>  In just one week.  Probably, there are still a hundred of such problems and it all accumulates like a snowball. <br>  I work at Microsoft, my personal life is in Google products, I use Apple devices and it all sucks.

    <h5>  You are one or many you do not care. <br></h5><br>  And that's the worst.  I did not call tech support for these issues.  I did not create bugs in the bug tracker and did not write to the developers.  Instead, I googled and noticed that for each case there are two possible scenarios. <br><ol><li>  No one has ever seen this.  You are one and don't care. </li><li>  Everyone has such a problem.  None of the developers believe you.  You have a lot and do not care. </li></ol><br>  There‚Äôs only one thing in common - the program doesn‚Äôt work and everyone cares <br><br><h5>  And now what i can do? <br></h5><br>  In 2012, we have open standards and open networks, corner and curly braces are carried along wires with gigabit speed.  But this is all absolute crap. <br><br><ul><li>  Maybe we are too rush to develop? </li><li>  Maybe a quality problem?  Have we forgotten the art and science of QA? </li><li>  Maybe the problem is with people?  Perhaps the developers simply have no desire to fix the problems? </li></ul><br><br>  I think all this taken together.  And you need to correct the situation together.  What do you think? <br>  PS If you think I'm just Noah, say so.  I complain not because it sucks, but because I KNOW that we can do better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151603/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151603/</a></p>
