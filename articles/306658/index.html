Well, we now have some more important news on this product, which deserve a separate review post. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This year, Ruckus Wireless itself has its own ‚Äúbudget‚Äù solution for small offices - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/comptek/blog/270265/">Unleashed</a> .  It turns out that the market niche Xclaim has become even smaller?  Being already locked in a very narrow market ‚Äúloophole‚Äù, Xclaim was positioned as simplified access points (hereinafter - TD) for small networks that do not require significant knowledge in the planning and administration of wireless networks for launch and support.  We decided to figure out when it is better to use and why.  Moreover, a new version of the cloud controller for Xclaim has recently been released.

      Since the last article about Xclaim, much has changed, and now the points are running a full-fledged cloud service or in standalone mode.  The cloud is, of course, foreign, with the appropriate facilities, such as the lack of local backup and accessibility from any devices (iOS, Android, and so on).  Access to the cloud controller is completely free, you just need to get a free account on xclaimwireless.com: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fec/ae1/0a0/fecae10a001846d0916599637694e898.jpg"><br>  I would like to remind you that along with that, Xclaim, unlike production equipment of the same Ubiquiti company, with the introduction of the long-awaited centralized management function, continues to support local administration using the Harmony application or via the local web interface and operating in ‚Äústandalone‚Äù mode, when the AP - to itself the commander and the chief.  To manage a network from one point, if the network is never planned to be expanded or simply not needed in the foreseeable future, it is not necessary to use a cloud controller. <br><br>  In general, during the year equipment has learned a lot of new things.  Under the spoiler we will try to bring all the possibilities of this system at the moment into a single table and note how new tricks turned out to train a not very old dog: <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Comparative table of Xclaim and Ruckus equipment parameters</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><table cellpadding="2"><tbody><tr><td>  <b>Function</b> </td><td>  <b>Xclaim</b> </td><td>  <b>Ruckus</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  Centralized application of WLAN settings * </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Isolation of clients of one TD from each other * </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Static VLAN per SSID </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  ChannelFly / AutoChannel </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Management of separate locations within one controller * </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Bandwidth limiting ‚Äúto / from client‚Äù </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Distribution of customers in the 2.4 / 5 GHz band </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Airtime fairness </td><td>  + </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WISPr">WISPr</a> </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Captive Portal * </td><td>  Integration with third-party portals </td><td>  Built-in portal, integration with third-party portals </td></tr><tr><td>  802.1x </td><td>  RADIUS </td><td>  RADIUS, AD, LDAP, TACACS </td></tr><tr><td>  Mesh networks </td><td>  Planned in the third quarter of 2016 </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  The number of SSIDs on the radio module </td><td>  four </td><td>  sixteen </td></tr><tr><td>  Beamflex </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Customizable QoS </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Balancing customers between TD </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Dynamic VLAN assignment to clients </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td></tr><tr><td>  Caller Location </td><td>  - </td><td>  + </td></tr></tbody></table>  * - functions appeared in the software from version 1.0.0.0.83 to 2.1.0.0.68) <br><br>  And a lot of functions (local subscriber base, roaming L3, client access to the network according to the assigned policies, guest keys for subscribers, dynamic PSK, Bonjour Gateway gateway, traffic tunneling, ACL for administrators, ACL for clients above L2, etc) There is now in TD Ruckus, but definitely in the near future will not appear on Xclaim.  There is also no support for 802.11r standards (Fast BSS Transition, a simplified transition between APs of one network), 802.11k (transmission of information by the access point to customers on the status of own radio resources and parameters of neighboring APs), Opportunistic Key Caching (an algorithm that allows the client not to go through the whole procedure AAA with 802.1x server when moving from one point to another). <br><br>  Some lyrics and explanations of the mechanisms of work on some points. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Xclaim and Ruckus technologies</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>Isolation of clients of one TD from each other is</i> implemented both for Xclaim and Ruckus in the same way: ARP frames coming from TD clients, which indicate the IP addresses of other TD clients, are simply reset and client devices do not receive a response to them.  Since the TD does not know behind its own limits, whether the client is connected with a specific IP address ‚Äúby air‚Äù or cable, it is impossible to isolate clients of different TDs included in the same broadcast domain in this way. <br><br>  <i>ChannelFly</i> is a proprietary technology, and the mechanism of its operation is explained rather superficially.  In short, this technology is positioned as a statistical analysis of the bandwidth of each of the channels available on the radio with a specified check period and automatic channel selection in accordance with the forecast, which is made according to the results of this analysis. <br><br>  <i>The distribution of clients by band</i> (can be read as ‚Äúpushing those who can work at 5 GHz into this band‚Äù) is implemented quite probabilously.  When attempting to associate such a subscriber to a 2.4 GHz radio module, the TD does not respond to several frames, which attempts to force the client to use the same SSID, but already sent by a 5 GHz radio module.  If the client is persistent enough in trying to connect to the ‚Äútwo‚Äù, then the distribution will not occur. <br><br>  <i>Airtime Fairness</i> is a set of measures aimed at compensating the problem of a ‚Äúslow client‚Äù, that is, a client with a low channel speed, which transfers its ‚Äúportion‚Äù of data to a point so long that it leaves very little time for transmission to the rest of the customers of this TD.  This was solved by reducing the transmission window for such clients in time.  Yes, the total bandwidth for a client working on low modulations in such a situation will be small, but all the other clients of this TD will transmit their data much faster and the radio resources of the TD will not be monopolized. <br><br>  <i>The number of SSIDs on the radio module</i> for Ruckus includes 4 SSIDs in the 5 GHz band, reserved for MESH, so the total number is 28 per point.  For Xclaim, after the appearance of the MESH function, the number of networks is also likely to decrease. <br></div></div><br>  Thus, Xclaim itself is positioned by the manufacturer as a ‚Äúsimplified Ruckus‚Äù, in which there is no abundance of functions designed to monitor and ensure the security of the wireless network, but in which configuration and management are substantially simplified, and the main functions that increase the load characteristics of the TDs are preserved. <br></div></div><br>  Let's continue launching the network under the control of the controller and enter with its existing data on its web interface: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/80a/31d/8bc/80a31d8bc0074fb58e5fd3372950acfb.jpg"><br><br>  And now we will indicate what we see when entering the controller.  The web interface is divided into several categories: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a9f/3cc/a59/a9f3cca59ff94df98b3af6c9429ba278.jpg"><br>  And, of course, each of these categories leads to a sub-menu of configuration tabs for individual parameters and settings: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74b/b4c/480/74bb4c4800864ea8b236aa2346e3e041.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74c/de8/733/74cde87334dc42d89ed7183a87f6ede6.jpg"><br><br>  Of all the variety of different options and possible ‚Äúabuse‚Äù of TDs, now it is most interesting for us to show how to connect the TDs to the controller and apply the settings of the newly created wireless network to it.  So, go to the Access Points section, which opens by default on the Register Access Point tab.  Fill in the information.  As you can see, the TD is associated with the controller's account by serial number, that is, without access to the Internet, the TDs cannot work with the controller (which, in principle, is logical, because the controller‚Äôs management interface cannot be raised in the local network either): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/014/a80/778/014a807788f9489bb0ceb0f81655ee74.jpg"><br><br>  Pay attention to the Tags field - you can add tags there to help determine whether points belong to different groups, for example, ‚ÄúMoscow, office, 2nd floor‚Äù and further apply some settings, grouping points by these tags (we will tell about this later) . <br>  For the convenience of registering points in the system, it is possible to load CSV with the list of necessary parameters of the AP (in the options you need to select the Add Multiple Aps tab): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/42c/c9a/628/42cc9a62811c4c6c98a32993b33aa60d.jpg"><br><br>  Now we see the point connected to the controller: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/82e/565/863/82e565863065474baa8c8aa06f344f04.jpg"><br><br>  Time to create a wireless network.  Go to the Networks section and select the type of network to be created.  We can make a guest network (pay attention to the Hotspot function - when it is activated, you will need to specify the address of your guest portal page. Since Xclaim does not and will not have a local subscriber base, there will also be no built-in guest portal on it): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca0/7d0/e45/ca07d0e45b974f8a97ada2820b3680ed.jpg"><br><br>  We can create a so-called business network (in fact, the difference between them in the encryption modes and AAA available for enabling): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be2/3aa/cf6/be23aacf65994070b5b6a2b46b394762.jpg"><br><br>  After clicking on Save, the created WLANs appear in the general table: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f5/af6/554/6f5af6554e9e49efa7344a61bc1fb765.jpg"><br><br>  Now you need to bind the wireless networks to the access point (s) and then the control of groups of points comes into play.  Let us return to the list of TDs to which another one has been added, indicated by the ‚Äúwarehouse‚Äù tag: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2d/e85/167/a2de851672ff42b49b38b8bc5f2c6afb.jpg"><br><br>  Now when I click on an assigned tag, I will only see the points with this tag: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b9/d17/850/6b9d1785047a419291e18aaabfd1c422.jpg"><br><br>  Mark this point with a tick (or a group of selected points at once) and select the Attach WLAN action from the Action menu: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bfe/90c/a9f/bfe90ca9f02d48aa8fbaf0a223de0f08.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3bf/7ee/3b1/3bf7ee3b1abd45a9aab51ec768c438ba.jpg"><br><br>  Now, the selected SSID will be transmitted from this point. <br><br>  If the address of the cloud controller is available from the point, then the settings are applied almost instantly - the controller informs the AP about changing the configuration file, which the point immediately downloads and applies.  It is important to remember that, for example, when the radio parameters change, the point restarts the radio modules - thus losing all the connected clients.  In this case, the point also constantly with a periodicity of 1 minute informs the controller about a change in its state and sends statistics on the use of the resources of the point. <br><br>  By and large, with the exception of a pretty page for monitoring client statistics and the function of generating reports in pdf format for clients, events with TDs, or both of these sets, the controller's functionality is limited to the features listed in this article.  Yes, there are not many hundreds of customizable parameters with which you can ‚Äúplay‚Äù for months, but the equipment itself is sold under the slogan ‚ÄúWi-Fi for non-IT guys‚Äù.  Simple, convenient, understandable - hence, it has reached its goal.  And since inside the TD sits the iron from quite a serious Ruckus points, then the task of ‚Äúdistributing the Internet in the office‚Äù solution is a great success.  Is it necessary to wait from him something else? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306658/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306658/</a></p>
