      Now let's talk about the truth.  How is it that someone is constantly in problems, and someone is constantly in development? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  That's how. <br><br>  A person has three stages of time in which his consciousness resides and several states of consciousness: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/2d2/806/4ac/2d28064ac840dae092a719f636757475.jpg"><br><br>  Someone is mostly in the past, someone in the present, someone in the future.  Analyzes, imagines or just having fun. <br><br>  Let me introduce - an animal with all the signs of a person.  A brief description of: <br><br>  1. For the most part, the consciousness in the "present" feels happening <br>  2. At the first opportunity, the brain escapes into the virtual constructions of someone else‚Äôs authorship, deriving pleasure from it. <br>  3. States of analysis and imagination are almost always turned off.  If they are included, then with obvious reluctance. <br><br>  A typical representative of the species, both office rats and working donkeys. <br><br>  Hateful work is tolerated because it brings bread.  The individual is not interested in a minute, it starts at home exactly at 18-00.  At home, he feverishly eats and enjoys a new series about ‚ÄúCops‚Äù, ‚ÄúTruckers‚Äù or some other chewing gum.  Additional information is not looking for, and if it finds, does not consume. <br><br>  The bad news is the number of representatives is extremely large. <br>  The good news is treatable (in rare cases). <br><br>  How to make a diagnosis?  If the individual whines that the circle is bad, the boss got it, the clients are morons and the wife of a fool is that. <br><br>  What is the reason?  If you have not understood, I am very worried.  Remember the line "System Idle - 95%" in the task manager.  The system is 95% loaded (or vice versa, not loaded) with slag, one way or another it is inactive.  With the illusion of work. <br><br>  The patient's brain does just that: it loads itself with virtual constructions at the first opportunity, plunging into entertainment.  Potryndet about how tastelessly dressed new girl with big breasts from the fourth section (all men do her stand) is just from this series.  Well, about the TV and do not repeat. <br><br>  For such people, everything around is a terrible and inexplicable force, guilty of their failures.  The global conspiracy, the machinations of fellow cretins, seasonality in sales are their unloved but constant companions.  Patients can talk about them for hours.  And they even build very convincing logical constructions.  Psychiatrists are well aware of this - many of their clients build logically flawless rationales of the most wild and illogical statements. <br><br>  And what I'm still leading.  What to do and how to be? <br><br>  But to what.  If it seems to you that around the ass, the enemies and nothing will ever change, the only cure is to pull the brain into the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe future.  And enter it into a state of imagination.  Make yourself think about what you want, turn on your imagination.  Draw a picture of your desired future in a large or small format.  You can invent your new life or you can invent a new department structure - what's the difference?  Scale is not important - think of something that you like and want to make. <br><br>  Now turn on the analysis state - decompose the invented model into elements.  Determine what it is?  And now - what are the elements?  And so on, until you reach the level of your equal awareness and experience.  I wanted to open a store, but you do not know how?  And you think and get at least to the element "call Vasya and ask how he opened the store," since you do not know anything else.  And start to learn. <br><br>  With the advancement from the private to the general, experience and awareness will grow.  With the embodiment of the first bricks invented - confidence.  And then the pleasure will come.  From this moment on, the mind will forget about other virtual constructions and will live only in its own.  Sometimes running to strangers to visit, to give his rest. <br><br>  The secret is simple - fix on the future, desire, fantasize, analyze and embody.  In the end, this is what all great artists do.  So are the paintings, buildings, symphonies and novels.  What are you worse? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129169/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129169/</a></p>
