  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Oh this web</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About a year ago, I seriously thought about the themes of hate to html that had recently become lame in Habr√©.  Indeed, html is just a text layout tool, it cannot be used to build a UI, which consists of layouts for 90%.  Rather, you can, but it turns out hell.  Among other things, the html case is when the data is mixed with the presentation.  It will not be possible to download html separately, but separate data.  There is an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãparsers. <br><br>  And even if in a thousand and one templates, this division is explicit, it ceases to be such at the output.  Someone wondered why the server is engaged in generating the view that the user needs, but does not need the server?  In addition, there is the problem of checking the data displayed for all users: these xss and so on.  I did not close the tags - I killed the site, which also fell on users. <br><br>  In my opinion, the only html task is to display br, strong, a, and so on.  There is no need to try to create a block layout, because block layout is an attempt to make layout using html tools.  And this whole idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe hierarchy of block content crumbles into dust when a child crawls out of parent'a.  Who ever thought of such a mocking idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcollection, why is it POSSIBLE at all?  In terms of code, WYSIWYG turns out to be some kind of weird - you see one code, but it can be displayed as and anywhere.  Why is this ambiguity necessary? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      And it will not be possible to make a complex block ui without crutches of the form -999px, etc.  By the way, why is there still no native support for layouts?  Already in a low level language it is faster to describe the interface than on the web.  And note: each designer is creating over / creating / styling / placing controls, which FOR A LONGLY have in ANY OS.  So why so many gestures to create the same, but different?  For what?  By the way, why should each site have a unique design?  Is it something forced?  Why desktop ui with the same control is not boring, and very motley non-standard interfaces on the desktop are considered moveton?  Well, yes, you can write another 20 templates that allow you to abstract from the sad realities.  And let the designers themselves -99999px nails nail ui to html. <br><br>  In the comments offered Qill in browsers.  This, IMHO, is a very interesting approach.  By the way, no one bothers to generate qml by the same methods as html. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  To sum up, the logical web for me will be: <br><ul><li>  user is contacting% s </li><li>  the server gives it a single script, binary, or qml-code </li><li>  The code automatically loads the public content from, for example, redis, deployed to public </li><li>  the client script independently generates a ui from this data, doing the escapes along with everything else </li><li>  as soon as the user needs a private area, he is given session_id / private_code using usual methods </li><li>  Further communication between the client and server is mq.  Key mq = session_id.  At first, redis will cope. </li></ul><br><br>  There are several projects that use redis in this way, but this is not the mainstream.  The idea itself is pleasant because the data is not given there (and not then) from which they were asked.  The user himself repeatedly applies for the data he needs.  And he does with them what he wants.  In this case, let him write at least his ui. <br><br>  As a result, the programmer‚Äôs task will be just one: to write a business logic that generates the correct data.  And that's all.  That is all.  And what to do with this data, how, when, why and why is the tenth matter.  There is no need to edit patterns, change the order of requests, etc.  Then the server part of the web-app will initially look like a set of interfaces for receiving data.  We don‚Äôt care what data the user‚Äôs home page and personal account will consist of.  If the user wants - he will write his ui. <br><br>  And one more assumption that I really want to do: the data and the code should always be separate.  And the web is no exception. <br><br>  If you divide the roles: <br><ul><li>  server is NOT directly or indirectly generating UI </li><li>  server provides data </li><li>  server is engaged in authentication </li><li>  client renders content based on the data <b>itself</b> </li><li>  all the problems with the screening of bad data fall on the client.  And the client <b>knows</b> what to screen because he asked for the data. </li><li>  the server should filter only those data that can damage only it.  Everything else is the client‚Äôs task. </li></ul><br><br>  So: <br><ul><li>  html is not a suitable convenient tool for creating ui </li><li>  generation of the impression from the data and the presentation is costly and not forced, because of Okkama‚Äôs razor‚Äôs throat </li><li>  the request-response model breaks asynchrony and binds both sides too much </li><li>  the consequences of html in the form of validation in general, all data is disgusting: the browser does not know in advance what it will receive, so it cannot set the right filters on the data.  And so that he knew this, he himself must ask them <b>clearly</b> </li></ul><br><br>  Almost any interesting site today is not just a page, but a mass of interfaces and data processing methods.  Why not separate the interface from the data right away?  It turns out that any site today imposes its presentation on me.  And I really do not like it.  I go to the site for information, and not for looking at pictures and new css3 zamanuh (I do not argue that sometimes it is very beautiful, but the beauty distracts and ultimately falls usability).  It infuriates me that I am searching for the search button on the page.  It infuriates me that on all sites of the same destination the buttons are located in different places.  I want to see sites just like all desktop apps. <br><br>  I do not want to incite holivar, just think: how many unforced assumptions do today's technologies contain.  How many times have you asked yourself questions like: ‚ÄúWhy am I here?‚Äù It is quite possible that if you do not take everything from a threshold as a given, one ideological regroup will put everything in its place. <br><br>  Personally, I think that too much of the effort in designing is deposited on ui.  It is there that crutches and redundancy center.  This is the first thing you need to make comfortable.  And you will not manage generators here: they do not solve the problem in itself, they only facilitate the spikach. <br><br>  Taking this opportunity, I congratulate everyone on the holiday and wish you creative success. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/143496/">https://habr.com/ru/post/143496/</a></p>
