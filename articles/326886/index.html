Read the first part.">elephant is</abbr> exactly like a palace column! </blockquote><br><h2>  <font color="#00B2FF">Chapter 3. We keep continuity</font> </h2><br>  <i>Basic metaphors.</i>  <i>Behavior.</i> <br><br>  One of the main tasks, I repeat, was to preserve the continuity between the old and the new interface.  The problem was solved in different ways.  First, element by element.  For example, all the icons of the new interface were redrawn anew on the basis of the previous ones, the old metaphors were preserved, and their unification along the way.  An example of the second.  The button of a group of commands on the toolbar in the old interface could be "decomposed" into several command buttons with similar functionality.  Initially, there was a desire to abandon this functionality, since  command group buttons are now present in the Settings panel. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">An example was in the first part of the article:</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Example for a group of commands Extrude. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d96/0f2/920/d960f2920f2f47c2996c67d1e6fb919e.png"><br>  <i>Classic look.</i>  <i>The group was displayed by the pressed <abbr title="Left mouse button">paint</abbr> on the icon.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c0/070/b4c/5c0070b4c5f0490c925c1bb20593ffa1.png"><br>  <i>Updated look.</i>  <i>Added option to display the group in the upper part of the settings panel (The image is clickable).</i> <br></div></div><br>  After testing, it was decided to return the old functionality of ‚Äúunfolding‚Äù the button by long pressing it. <br><br>  Secondly, it is functional.  For example, the buttons on the Special Control Panel.  The new concept involves the transfer of commands in the context of action.  Therefore, the panel was excluded, and all the buttons on it present, moved to the context of user actions or changed.  This happened to the command Point again - in the new interface, its function is performed by the <abbr title="A control in the form of a list (for several objects) or a field (for one object) in which the names of the selected objects are displayed during the execution of a command (that is, they are registered).

The switch function between toolbars is retained and rethought.  Switching occurs in a new, more convenient and compact form.  Switching is not between the toolbars responsible for a particular type of operation, but between logical sets of commands that are responsible for a particular type of designer activity, be it solid modeling or sheet body modeling. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/859/b13/496/859b1349661248448ccedee50dea0d0c.png"></a> <br>  <i>Compact panel (left) and list of sets (right).</i>  <i>The picture is clickable.</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">For clarity, this is the list of building kits.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Now the list can be almost endless, before it was seriously limited and on the compact panel there was only one building panel ‚ÄúSPDS designation‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/384/bda/3fb/384bda3fbdd04c22a3404cc79987eaea.png"><br><br>  The remaining panels of construction tools were arranged randomly: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f5/f5e/cb0/3f5f5ecb088f44069e1c75a86f4a78ce.png"><br></div></div><br><blockquote>  - The dispute is empty - <br>  A pipe, a column ...

Those.  if the elements are similar in appearance, then the actions of the user and the functionality of them should be similar.  What was it for?  So that the user, knowing the basic principles, could engage in his immediate activities, and did not recall the rules for working with this or that interface element, but in a slightly different environment. <br><br>  Work was also carried out on the unification of metaphors of icons (pictograms).  Those.  all the same metaphors denote the same action or object. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a1c/a8c/603/a1ca8c6034e74f25ac404272a325d595.png"><br>  <i>Metaphors of icons.</i> <br><br>  All panels are now unified and work in a single interface space.  The display of the panels is controlled from a single group of the Main Panel.  All panels are unified in design and behavior.  Those.  Any panel can be undocked from the edge of the screen and made floating, docked to other panels or to another side of the screen, and even placed on another monitor. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f8/40d/a7a/7f840da7a9024271b26f123a14a3c2c9.png"></a> <br>  <i>Floating panel "Variables" (The image is clickable).</i> <br><br>  Interactive messages have also undergone processing, all of them are built on a single base and have a single message encoding. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/306/21d/1cb/30621d1cbf894d4cbac15efdd573f862.png"></a> <br>  <i>The ‚ÄúSave Document‚Äù dialog (the image is clickable).</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/92f/0d1/090/92f0d109081e4b8991aa6231182b55cf.png"></a> <br>  <i>Dialog ‚ÄúDelete objects‚Äù (the image is clickable).</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">So the dialogues looked like in previous versions.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5f6/0b5/663/5f60b5663f6a43b791a381be2b6c8b5c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/718/538/11b/71853811bda04b398f595324da89dd87.png"><br><br></div></div><br><blockquote>  - The elephant is most likely similar to the Shah's throne! </blockquote><br><h2>  <font color="#00B2FF">Chapter 5. Total vectorization</font> </h2><br>  <i>Framework, lack of hardcode, vector icons, vector hot points.</i> <br><br>  When switching to a new interface, there was a need to choose a framework for the interface.  I will immediately indicate that in this chapter I consider the framework only from the interface side, leaving the criteria of programmers beyond the limits of the narration.  So, the existing libraries of ready-made interface elements did not suit the absence of non-standard interface elements, the lack of flexibility and possible problems with updating and support in the future.  Since  A third-party library is always a black box.  After several tests, WPF from Microsoft was chosen as the most suitable for our purposes. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c15/748/6e3/c157486e3d074453add427edc74a91e9.png"></a> <br>  <i>General view of the interface.</i>  <i>The display mode is "Halftone with frame".</i>  <i>(The picture is clickable)</i> <br><br>  Conceptually, the interface is designed in such a way that, with minor changes, it can be adapted to future tasks.  The focus is on the adaptability of the interface for different screen resolutions.  That is, the entire interface (with rare exceptions) adapts to the needs of users.  This is achieved as a ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù interface programming, in which the size of the interface elements are not strictly defined in the code, but depend on the size of the system font, and the almost complete absence of raster images in the interface (except for images in the interface help).  To realize this allows our know-how - fully vector icons, both monochrome and color.  You ask how it helps the user?  I answer.  At any screen resolution, the v17 interface remains predictable and stable.  All interface elements are proportional to each other and clearly displayed.  The user with the help of Windows system settings can now control the size of interface elements and interface text.  In the future, we plan to make such support inside KOMPAS-3D.  Those.  the user will be able to customize the size of the interface text and icons depending on their preferences. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Feature points</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/587/f83/b6e/587f83b6e5a345b696cbbed7b5f7b8f9.png"><br>  <i>Characteristic points for the extrusion element (blue triangles and squares).</i> <br></div></div><br>  But on this, our work on the vectorization of the interface has not ended.  We made vector feature points that can also change their size depending on the system font settings in Windows. <br><blockquote>  - Your elephant is a big polished peak! </blockquote><br><h2>  <font color="#00B2FF">Chapter 6. We remove the modality</font> </h2><br>  <i>All commands are available, a minimum of dialogs, the dialogs ‚Äúmove‚Äù to the ‚ÄúParameters‚Äù panel.</i>  <i>Minimum user context switches (working in the stream).</i>  <i>Pass-through selection.</i> <br><br>  To maintain the <abbr title="Such a mental state in which a person is fully included in what he does is focused, fully involved and focused on the success of his work.">streaming state of</abbr> users, we removed the modality in the teams.  Now almost all commands are available at any time.  If the action in the command is completed, there are no construction errors and the user switches to another command, then the object is built without confirmation, and the transition to the next command is made.  This allows you to work very effectively, without being distracted by artificial interruptions.  Also minimized the number of dialog boxes.  Some of them were removed completely, and their functionality was transferred to the ‚ÄúParameters‚Äù panel, to the ‚Äútrees‚Äù on the model / drawing.  Some have transformed into a more comfortable look.  For example, the size setting dialog now looks like a small panel next to the dimension text. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/369/981/3b9/3699813b9f4a44088759fad9e5e04aea.png"></a> <br>  <i>Dialogue for setting dimension text.</i>  <i>Classic view (Picture is clickable)</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4d8/bb9/a32/4d8bb9a324bd4f5e811b87644680976c.png"></a> <br>  <i>Dialogue for setting dimension text.</i>  <i>Updated view (Picture clickable)</i> <br><br>  To facilitate the location of objects implemented cross-selection.  That is, if an object is present in a list or tree, then when it is selected on a model or drawing, it is highlighted in a tree or list and vice versa. <br><br><blockquote>  - <abbr title="The first letter of the Arabic alphabet looks like a spear or a harpoon">Alif</abbr> he straight. </blockquote><br><h2>  <font color="#00B2FF">Chapter 7. Contrast Themes</font> </h2><br>  <i>Why 50 shades of gray and why 50 shades darker.</i> <br><br>  At the very beginning of the article, I already wrote that the interface is evil.  But did not decipher why.  I do it now.  The ideal interface, paradoxically, is the complete lack of interface.  If the engineer had the opportunity to design products without any additional interface, then it would be an ideal product and everyone would like it.  But historically, the evolution of technology proceeded through the development and improvement of tools, and any tool is an interface.  By making the tool more convenient and efficient, you sort of remove it from your consciousness, i.e.  don't notice it, it ceases to exist for you.  Agree that during work you will often pay attention to the shovel, if its cutting is poorly polished, and you will not pay attention to the well-polished cutting, paying attention to digging.  So with the interface.  The less noticeable it is, the more you give yourself to your work, the more productive and happier you will become. <br><br>  By making the gray-neutral the main color for the interface of the KOMPAS-3D v17, we have removed the unnecessary, annoying component of the old interface - the irrational multicolor. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Examples of causeless multicolor</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0e8/92e/2ea/0e892e2ea9554cd597546a3c2f9a5e99.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f5b/df9/438/f5bdf9438d494ffe93ecdfbe7d26d657.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e47/678/ba1/e47678ba18a749109b3a2a64559848d0.jpg"><br><br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Different display modes of the new interface</b> <div class="spoiler_text"> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f9c/6e1/d71/f9c6e1d7196e452e86bfb5ee736b6dd7.png"></a> <br>  <i>Monochrome icons.</i>  <i>Light mode (Picture is clickable).</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c2/eff/16f/5c2eff16fd134a44b76ddd3309e4e784.png"></a> <br>  <i>Monochrome icons.</i>  <i>Dark mode (Picture is clickable).</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bcb/7a6/940/bcb7a6940a0d48758f5d2475d800f8a5.png"></a> <br>  <i>Colored icons.</i>  <i>Light mode (Picture is clickable).</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/46a/05c/5ea/46a05c5ead0b424ab148c662b47cea9e.png"></a> <br>  <i>Colored icons.</i>  <i>Dark mode (Picture is clickable).</i> <br></div></div><br>  But we have not completely abandoned the color, as it may seem at first glance.  Color is now an additional factor that attracts the user's attention.  Whether it is a color model, or a drawing, or an indication of the state of the system.  It is much easier to notice a bright colored light at dusk than on a festive Christmas tree with toys and tinsel.  We did not forget about the contrast.  The contrast of the new interface background: text \ icons is 11.2: 1 in the light theme and 5.69: 1 in the dark one.  This is consistent with <abbr title="The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines">WCAG</abbr> recommendations.  Such a margin of contrast allows you to work with different lighting without straining your eyesight. <br><br><blockquote>  - How <abbr title="The eighth letter of the Arabic alphabet looks like a fishing hook">far</abbr> he is bent! </blockquote><br><h2>  <font color="#00B2FF">What is ready?</font>  <font color="#00B2FF">Not ready!</font>  <font color="#00B2FF">Haircut just started!</font> </h2><br>  Well, perhaps that's all.  In the next versions we are not going to stop there and we will continue to improve the interface and working methods. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1e/a27/9e7/c1ea279e719841c5af5504277d590707.png"></a> <br>  <i>The ‚ÄúFrame‚Äù display mode is turned on (the image is clickable).</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/942/e91/c43/942e91c43ab94eda8c710ffd681ca8be.png"></a> <br>  <i>Collage of different display modes in one window (The image is clickable).</i> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4c/2e8/b28/c4c2e8b28762478fb7995b511c4b1b48.png"></a>  Sergey Shvetsov, ASCON user interface designer </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/326886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/326886/</a></p>
