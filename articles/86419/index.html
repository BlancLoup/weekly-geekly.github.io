  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of the "bad company"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello to all! <br>  This is not about bad company in the usual sense, but about the game Battlefield Bad Company 2. <br>  Admittedly, they waited a long time, stubbornly, recommended to everyone.  And that's why: <br><h5>  <i>Dedicated server</i> </h5><br>  Everyone who played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 knows how <s>Infinity Ward spat 200+ to the signatories of the petition</s> lacking dedicated servers.  Therefore, when producer Gordon Van Dyke himself <a href="http://www.next-gen.biz/news/battlefield-bad-company-2-will-use-dedicated-servers">said</a> that there would be dedicated servers, we all sighed with relief and ran to order a mother for the Intel Xeon.  We dreamed of playing the tactical shooter with the least delay ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  <i>Freaky multiplayer</i> </h5><br>  - Different types of equipment <br>  - A huge number of weapons for every taste <br>  - Server holds up to 32 players <br>  - Huge maps with hellish landscape <br><br>  But how upset we were when they realized that the companies themselves are making from ‚Äúcandy - shit‚Äù. <br><br><h5>  <i>The sense of importance of the player is a myth</i> </h5><br>  It all started with a beta test.  Began to sell pre-order the game, which includes access to beta.  We hurried to buy.  Disappointment was not a chapel when on one of the sites in a few days, everyone handed out keys for the beta. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

      <br>
    <h5>  <i>Beta should be a test, but in moderation</i> </h5><br>  Beta also turned out to be hellish - there was no higher than 40 fps on top videos even by the end of the beta test.  It's okay, my personal niggles, they still ran in the game. <br>  But for example, my friend after the beta test still does not believe me that the FPS in this game rises above 40 and does not want to play. <br><br><h5>  <i>Partners</i> </h5><br>  The day has come to send the keys.  The store that sent the keys declared hellish "original ddos ‚Äã‚Äãattack" because of the 50 people who were on the forum.  When I tried to point out that on the server, along with the store, there were another 25 sites with popularity higher than them, I was told that ‚Äúeverything is not so simple‚Äù as it seems to me.  Okay, this will also pass.  I understand, sometimes feils happen. <br><br><h5>  <i>Continuing beta after off-release</i> </h5><br>  Got the key, put the game.  Attempting to enter the game first led to failures due to the impossibility of collateralization.  Then the game complained about my bad internet.  When the game was released, I tried to play - I was kicked from each server after 1 minute of the game.  However, the person kicked me or it was a glitch - it was not possible to establish it. <br><br><h5>  <i>Server public</i> </h5><br>  Further more.  Forteam's vaunted partners fell off the servers, and those that were slightly raised were clogged, all 32 slots.  It should be noted that they could be counted on the fingers.  I didn‚Äôt want to play with foreign ping on foreign ones. <br><br><h5>  <i>Cheated ...</i> </h5><br>  Then I realized that I had to raise my own, on the old iron.  I got into the Internet for the distribution of the server ... I did not find anything, at first I thought that I did not have time to lay out what I was looking for badly. <br>  Began to read further - all promises were forgotten and there will be no dedicated servers in the usual sense. <br>  But they will be paid, as it turned out today - they will cost from 60r per slot for the same forteam.  At least 16 slots - that is, 960r.  Maximum 32 slots - that is 1960. If I wanted to pay for something every month, I would play WoW. <br><br><h5>  <i>We pay for gadgets to technology</i> </h5><br>  After the release, the game began to cost 560 rubles.  That is, for 340r, I bought some kind of automatic machine and other gadgets to the technique.  But‚Ä¶ <br><br><h5>  <b>Results:</b> </h5><br>  Servers are paid.  Multiplayer does not work due to the fact that forteam servers do not log on to 4 servers, everything is always crammed.  Gave money for "drawn pictures." <br>  All is sad.  Money is not a pity, for the game is insulting. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86419/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86419/</a></p>
