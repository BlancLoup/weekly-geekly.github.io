  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS - premium video recorder</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  What really to hide, AdvoCam has recently been very actively talking about itself to readers of Geektimes - take at least a recent <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/265592/">FAQ on the choice of recorders</a> , a review of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/265486/">AdvoCam-FD Sport</a> and the subsequent frantic <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/266692/">debate about the real origin of the model</a> .  However, ‚Äúsuddenly‚Äù it turned out that the current flagship of the brand, AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS, has not yet been presented to readers of Geektimes.  Which, last but not least, ensured AdvoCam entry into the TOP-3 brands in terms of sales volumes of recorders in Russia in the first half of 2015.  The paradox is that the model - for a moment - was released exactly a year ago, but has not lost its relevance so far.  Do not believe?  Well, see (or rather, read) yourself. <br><br>  The processor and matrix of the model is the ‚Äúiron‚Äù ceiling, which is still used in the flagship recorders of the most popular brands.  There is simply nothing better in the market, then a change in the generation of the hardware platform.  At least the new Omnivision matrix, which has not yet been told to a wide audience.  In general, AdvoCam approached me as an experienced user of AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS and asked me to express my opinion about the device ‚Äúuncensored‚Äù. <br><br> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/267304/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e4/a2a/d72/3e4a2ad72ca88d8cc2ee9b80721a38c8.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The AdvoCam website is priced at 12,490 rubles, but the real price tag in the stores ranges from <a href="https://market.yandex.ru/product/11634794%3Fhid%3D6269371%26suggest%3D1">10-10.4 thousand rubles</a> .  This is despite the fact that a number of brands have increased the price of their top registrars with such a ‚Äústuffing‚Äù up to 15,000 rubles.  The price that buyers used to "forgive" only in exceptional cases, like top-end multi-channel models or the development of authoritative, say, South Korean brands.

      I think it is not worth telling once again who AdvoCam are, what kind of employees they work here and how they approach the process of testing their devices.  About all this long ago told <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/229489/">here</a> and once again mentioned <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/265592/">here</a> . <br><br><h2>  Design and Development </h2><br>  The design in which the device is made can be called traditional for the brand.  The entire line of devices of the AdvoCam FD8 series is made in exactly the same package, with the exception of the insert color on the front panel of the devices.  What color is specified in the name of the model, such is the inset - black, red or gold.  AdvoCam-FD8 Profi Blue will not be recorded in the current series - the model is discontinued, it was essentially replaced by a ‚Äúblack colleague‚Äù - AdvoCam-FD8 Black.  By the way, no joke - they stopped producing the ‚Äúblue‚Äù version due to low demand.  Which in turn was caused not by the most courageous from the point of view of consumers by the color of the panel on the front of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/95d/1ef/491/95d1ef4916e29393386cc47ea4e16d0c.jpg"><br><br>  This has <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/266692/">already been told</a> , so I‚Äôll remind you briefly - in appearance, the twins of the AdvoCam line cannot be found on Aliexpress and Co., the design is exclusive.  AdvoCam considered it appropriate to spend on the development of the order of $ 30,000 due to the fact that in the end this design was already involved in the four most popular models, three of which are still selling well.  This allowed "to scatter" the costs so that the final buyer paid the minimum amount for the unique building. <br><br>  In general, the starting point of the entire current line was AdvoCam-FD8 Profi RED, the body was originally prepared for this model.  The device became the ideological continuation of AdvoCam-FD7 Profi, the first in Russia (in 2013) recorder with Super HD shooting.  This is due to the Ambarella A7LA50 processor, which was replaced in Red by the more advanced A7LA50D, which added warnings about speed cameras, among other things. <br><br>  As I was told in AdvoCam, the development of the Gold model was relatively even and calm, the lion's part of the work was already done with the release of Red, which became the basis for Gold.  I note that the AdvoCam-FD8 Profi RED board was ‚Äúre-divided‚Äù several times after the model was released, including to improve the stability of the device.  However, a number of points, albeit uncritical in general, demanded improvements precisely at the hardware level.  Therefore, in AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS they took into account the Red experience and implemented the very improvements (which is a commercial secret :). <br><br><h2>  About appearance </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/956/a78/289/956a78289acded31f07479e31e5aeaf4.jpg"><br><br>  The gadget is a monoblock elongated at the edges with rounded corners.  The AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS case is made of black velvety soft-touch plastic.  For some reason, some manufacturers of automotive devices began to abandon this practical material, choosing a gloss, and in vain - on the "softtache" dust / dirt is not visible, and even minor scratches with scratches, too.  I note that AdvoCam is very fond of soft-touch coverage since the days of the legendary, but already archived AdvoCam-FD5 Profi.  In the comments, they <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/266692/">told the</a> story of how the partner factory resold to the competitor brand the hull design developed by AdvoCam.  The conflict was settled (alas, the exclusive status was lost irretrievably), but the factory was given a condition - only AdvoCam can produce this case in soft touch, only third-party brand plastic can give third-party customers.  Pah-pah, but the Chinese are regularly fulfilling this condition. <br><br>  AdvoCam-FD8 Gold is assembled very carefully.  Even with a strong desire to find a flaw in the assembly of the device is unlikely to succeed.  All parts of the recorder body fit snugly together, there are no uneven joints, burrs on plastic, etc.  It is even a small minus, because it is very difficult to disassemble the body without leaving marks on the two tightly fitting halves of the ‚Äúexterior‚Äù. <br><br>  The location of the elements familiar to the registrar brand.  So, on the front side of the AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS is a camera lens girdled with a silver ring.  Here we see the already mentioned golden insert, and next to it is a LED backlight.  As for me, they could save money on the backlight, for two years now, as it is quite reasonable, they are not even built into top recorders.  The times of delusion ‚Äúmore light bulbs - better shooting at night‚Äù are long gone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dfb/8bf/043/dfb8bf043101f6c0b2e6a93b1a443626.jpg"><br><br>  On the opposite side is a large display by the registrar standards, its diagonal is 2.7 inches, and the resolution is 640x360 pixels.  What I like about advocacy screens is the ‚Äúcinema‚Äù aspect ratio.  Total display is elongated, and with such a large screen size, the case is slightly higher than the box of matches.  A video can be viewed in full screen mode.  In this regard, the registrars with square displays cause me a misunderstanding, where, with a diagonal of about 2.5 inches, we get a bulky case with still a tiny picture when watching a video. <br><br>  To the left and right of the screen there is one double control key. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8d4/96e/549/8d496e549596e2de3f24ed790c1bebdb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6c4/c02/37f/6c4c0237fef1bda89c0f95014335662d.jpg"><br><br>  Two more single buttons are located on the top of the AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS.  That is, there are only six keys.  Management is simple and convenient, getting confused here is almost unreal.  I note that in this recorder, as in the entire AdvoCam line, a proprietary management interface called OneTouch is implemented.  This is when one keystroke can quickly enable or disable basic functions.  In fact, let's say, AdvoCam was only among the first companies to use this approach.  Now it is the absolute and unchanging standard of almost every first registrar.  Turn on / off the microphone, screen, emergency mark, etc.  is performed at the touch of a button, and the keys themselves carry two to four functions depending on the mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f2/367/477/7f23674776590d75a784e7c890842016.jpg"><br><br>  On the right side of the case there is a slot for a microSD memory card.  By the way, the AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS package includes the SanDisk Ultra 10 class card with a capacity of 8 GB.  On the SanDisk website, it is described as ‚Äúwaterproof, shockproof, heat-resistant and resistant to X-rays‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f2d/550/b0f/f2d550b0f51a955950bc2d6600e70f3a.jpg"><br><br>  On the left side of the recorder is the HDMI connector and a reset button recessed into the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b3/d59/2f5/0b3d592f50f2e32020e8ac7039825cd3.jpg"><br><br>  Above, besides the two keys already mentioned, there is an AV-out, miniUSB-port and contact pad. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/318/d2f/fa0/318d2ffa09dfff5d5f6b3881d2da8956.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, by the way, the power cable is not connected to the recorder itself, but to the mounting bracket.  Thus, when installing or removing the gadget you do not have to mess with the wire and plug.  This is convenient, agree. <br><br>  The mounting bracket itself consists of two parts (a vacuum sucker with a clip and a contact pad) connected by a hinge.  I like the power supply scheme, the external GPS receiver and the hinge, which allows you to flexibly adjust the direction of the camera ‚Äúlook‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f8/83d/ad7/0f883dad7e6af72f53cbe6956e1b33a8.jpg"><br><br>  However, I really hope that in subsequent models AdvoCam will finally add a washer-clamp in order to reliably fix the selected position of the recorder.  Otherwise, whatever one may say, but over time with regular driving on bad roads, the hinge becomes loose.  Well at least, that the new mount can be easily found - it just does not belong to the number of developments AdvoCam and is used in many registrars.  Ideally, I would generally like to see the choice of a suction cup and 3M.  I like mounting it on scotch tape, with it you don‚Äôt have to wait for the cabin to warm up in winter and look at the recorder already hung on the glass with caution: ‚ÄúWon't it disappear?‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9aa/7c2/078/9aa7c2078172dfcc5cfae49d11ee6dff.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Videography </h2><br>  The AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS uses a 6-lens clear glass lens.  The matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãa 4-megapixel OmniVision OV4689 with a physical size of 1/3 ". As AdvoCam competitors in the face of TrendVision say," the best sensor in 2015. "During the development of the recorder, AdvoCam tested two matrix options. In addition to OmniVision OV4689, the American also claimed for implementation Aptina AR0330 is a popular solution found in many AdvoCam devices. However, a direct comparison revealed the unequivocal superiority of OmniVision. One could consider the introduction of a Sony Exmor IMX322. <br><br>  Lawyers praised the quality of shooting in the presence of this matrix.  But indicated that this is a fairly expensive component, not the best solution in terms of price and features.  Applying a Sony product would have increased the price of the camera ‚Äúat the entrance‚Äù by about $ 10, and ‚Äúat the exit‚Äù (i.e., retail price including logistics, taxes, etc.) for all $ 20.  What at the current rate would be plus almost 1.5 thousand rubles. <br><br>  OmniVision itself attracts attention at least due to the fact that due to the architecture of OmniBSI-2 and a large 2 Œºm pixel, the best in the class photosensitivity is achieved.  What, as you understand, is of paramount importance for obtaining high-quality images in poor light.  And more importantly, it makes the optical path even more dependent on the lens. <br><br>  The manufacturer has put a bad lens - if you please, in fact, overpay for an expensive processor and a matrix, whose capabilities are revealed at the level of the average price segment registrar at best. <br><br>  I understand that this is not an entirely correct comparison - the lenses, the processor, and the price is far from the same ... But what the OmniVision OV4689 in AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS and Aptina AR0330 in AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS RED shows.  In the ‚Äúred‚Äù quality is not bad, but in comparison with the ‚Äúgold‚Äù digital noise is still more noticeable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/717/a78/9d0/717a789d08596e2293ca9f58951fa76f.jpg"><br>  <i>AdvoCam-FD8 Profi-GPS RED</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c4a/12d/ffa/c4a12dffa8afeace01e4e353d7161d2f.jpg"><br>  <i>AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS</i> <br><br>  The Ambarella A7LA70 processor used in the model belongs to the ‚Äúbest of the best‚Äù category.  Above - only A7LA85, which by and large differs only in support of a wide range of wireless standards.  If to compare with A7LA50, then the model with two sevens in the name differs mainly in support of 1080p 60 frames per second.  By the way, during the preparation of the ‚Äúprogenitor‚Äù Gold - Red models - AdvoCam made the final decision to skip the work with Ambarella A7LA30 processors altogether (the maximum shooting resolution is 1080p).  Frontal comparisons have shown that at a lower price, the models with the Novatek 96650 show the same recording quality, therefore they are ‚ÄúTaiwanese‚Äù and have been set up in the relatively budgetary AdvoCam-FD8 Black. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9bd/e3e/dbc/9bde3edbc5221365d59c6798cc960440.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/764/501/52b/76450152b6ddabc6812cdc78d5518383.jpg"><br><br>  I will give a list of video modes of the model: <br><br>  ¬∑ Super Full HD - 2304x1296 pixels, 30 frames per second; <br>  ¬∑ Wide HD - 2560x1080 pixels, 30 frames per second (wide frame, the sky and the hood are not in the field of view of the camera); <br>  ¬∑ Full HD - 1920x1080 pixels, 60 frames per second (smoother video); <br>  ¬∑ Full HD + HDR - 1920x1080 pixels, 30 frames per second (brighter image at night, but lower frame clarity); <br>  ¬∑ HD - 1280x720 pixels, 30 frames per second. <br><br>  I rate the recording quality as high - there is no ‚Äúsoap‚Äù day and night, the numbers are ‚Äúreadable‚Äù by 15‚Äì20 meters depending on the lighting, good color rendition.  Some citizens complain about problems when recording 1080p 60 fps, but my camera always works stably in this mode.  Indeed, there were questions to 1080p HDR, recently advocates provided a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/265592/">beta version of the</a> updated firmware with the correction of the flaw. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MDi6pEhYFZ4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lTmgO8QHhoM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Video recording in AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS occurs cyclically, in fragments of 1, 5, 10 or 15 minutes.  Thus, when the memory card becomes full, the recording will not stop - just a new fragment of the video will be recorded on top of the oldest one.  A complete card is enough for 1 hour Super HD or 1.5 hours Full HD. <br><br>  If there is a long monotonous road, I usually turn on TimeLapse mode, here the frequency is set to 1 or 5 frames per second. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8uD2VHLv5wA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h2>  Additional features </h2><br>  In order not to delete anything that is needed during cyclic rewriting, you can manually mark the video as important - you should press the "M" button to the right of the screen.  There is also an automatic mode in which the built-in G-sensor is used.  So, upon impact, sudden braking, or an unexpected change in direction, this sensor automatically marks the video as important and stores it in a special non-erasable area on the memory card.  Frankly, I don‚Äôt really trust the G-sensor and, in fact, I prefer to mark important events manually. <br><br>  Provided in AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS and motion sensor.  Theoretically, you can leave the recorder in the car, and it will automatically start recording when a moving object appears in the frame.  It will turn off again automatically - after a few seconds after the movement in the frame stops.  And although often this feature helps to find sloppy drivers who have scratched your car in the parking lot, I prefer not to tempt fate.  If I am not in the car, there is no recorder on the windshield.  Otherwise, it is likely that the video with the attacker in the frame will be ‚Äúnot only all‚Äù, but only the hero of the video report that opens my car and takes my registrar with it. <br><br>  Implemented in AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS and LDWS system, it is designed to control the car's lane.  Its main purpose is to reduce the number of accidents that have occurred through the fault of drivers who have fallen asleep or distracted.  In other words, the device monitors the movement of the car along the lane and in case of a shift to the next lane (which may be an ‚Äúoncoming‚Äù), the gadget emits a loud signal.  Needless to say, good road markings and lighting are necessary for proper operation of the LDWS.  As you understand, both points are not an option for the majority of roads in Russia.  So guess why the option is disabled for me.  At the same time, on a clear day and in normal weather, the technology actually works and basically the squeaking is really heard on the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/be4/260/66a/be426066a942f602c615aee2c151be7e.jpg"><br><br>  Immediately, several AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS functions add a GPS satellite communication receiver.  Firstly, it automatically sets the correct date and time in the recorder settings.  This is important, as in the case of incorrect dates and times, the video may not be attached to the statement of claim to the court.  Or they will, but they will have to spend time on a couple of extra pieces of paper and conducting an examination of the authenticity of the video.  Secondly, the gadget records the motion track, which can be viewed on a computer or laptop in the complete software player.  Thirdly, the device‚Äôs memory contains the coordinates of the stationary and mobile DPS posts, speed cameras and other objects, including the Strelka-ST radar systems. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3dd/786/7ca/3dd7867ca8861a6df28389a7ee691bbc.jpg"><br><br>  When approaching such ‚Äúpoints‚Äù, AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS will notify you with a sound signal in advance.  However, the case is not limited to radars alone - below is the full list of objects that the registrar warns about.  By the way, the base was last updated <a href="">not so long ago</a> , on November 15th. <br><br><h2>  Contents of delivery </h2><br>  In conclusion, let's say about the configuration of AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/542/a5d/2b5/542a5d2b5f3f2def0b2adbae3987dac5.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b4/f9e/63f/3b4f9e63fa5eba6767f6e7b5279d357c.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cce/775/471/cce775471443de80a10c8cf887c1cc80.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the recorder itself, it comes with a cigarette lighter charger with a long 4-meter cable and an additional USB port, a bracket on a vacuum suction cup, 3M adhesive hooks for laying the charger cable around the car, 8 GB memory card, USB-miniUSB cord , CD with software, user manual and warranty card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a18/f3b/534/a18f3b534013bdec5ae535c57669e228.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/707/fda/897/707fda8978bb55d1244f16d4c5c66712.jpg"><br><br>  Also included in the delivery package is an information sheet with useful tips from the president of the legal protection board and the famous TV host Viktor Travin.  The thing is very useful, it is unlikely that someone specifically devotes a couple of evenings to memorizing the order of actions with video during an accident.  Here is a compact brochure, which I always keep in the glove compartment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/971/876/254/971876254fde51bfd7f217d8d288eed0.jpg"><br><br><h2>  findings </h2><br>  To summarize  My AdvoCam-FD8 Gold GPS was working stably and was probably not going to fail.  Unless with HDR there was a problem, but it was already eliminated in the first days of December with the next firmware.  Total - the model offers almost everything that can be found in registrars for a little more than 10 thousand rubles.  Although it will be interesting to those who choose the device, focusing on the quality of the shooting, and not LDWS or the presence of an accelerometer.  But the warning about any "Strelka" was also on the list of my priority requirements for the registrar.  I repeat - there were options and cheaper, to find Super HD models for 7-8 thousand rubles is not difficult.  However, it seems that there manufacturers saved and put less high-aperture lenses.  And the most important thing is that they hardly tested and prepared models for the Russian climate and roads in the way <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartgadget/blog/229489/">AdvoCam does</a> . <br><br>  PS As you remember, in the review of <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/265486/">AdvoCam-FD Sport</a> , I misled my readers by pointing out that the design of the device was supposedly developed by Russian experts.  I offer my sincere apologies, now I will be more attentive to such statements and ask AdvoCam again in order to avoid confusion.  The material has been corrected, and the necessary explanations for the model itself <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/advocam/blog/266692/">have already been given in full</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/367277/">https://habr.com/ru/post/367277/</a></p>
