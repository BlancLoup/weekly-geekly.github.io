    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Start: </h5><br>  Having decided that being a freelancer, it was already impossible to work on a bulky and completely non-mobile workstation, I decided to completely switch to a good laptop.  I do video design, so I chose a laptop with a fairly high production capacity.  Almost immediately, my choice was on the HP Envy Dv-7 7266er.  At that time there were no competitors in the price category.  I purchased a laptop in a large computer network for 46 tr. <br><br>  My joy did not last long, two months later, interlacing appeared on the laptop monitor.  It was not possible to work on such a device and I went to the store where I bought it.  Understandably, for warranty repair, I had to leave the laptop in the store and wait up to 45 days according to the law of the end of the repair.  I independently (to speed up the process) delivered a laptop to a service center to which the store sent me. <br><br>  <b>Note:</b> If you want to get a replacement laptop for the period of repair, take the piece of paper that you will be given in the service (a safe receipt) and go to the store where you write an application for issuing a replacement laptop.  Within three days they are obliged to give you a product with similar consumer properties.  In my case, the seller went to meet me, not without persuasion, but issued a replacement laptop immediately.  Note taken from you and give out a laptop. <br><br><h5>  Cheating: </h5><br>  A long 45 days of repair lasted, I regularly pinged for service, and even on the 40th day of repair, spare parts to the service center had not even been received from HP.  On the 44th day of repair, the phone finally rang and I was informed that the laptop was ready.  I rushed to take the temporary laptop back to the store, received a safe receipt and arrived at the service center.  On the spot, he quickly checked, checked his performance and took him home. <br><br>  Having decided to relax a bit in the evening, I launched my favorite Civilization, and found a suspiciously slow response.  I climbed into the system, I found an incredible there: instead of my GeFore 650m video card, there was GeFore 630m there.  Wow!  I was surprised to the depths of my soul, and the next day I called the service center and described the situation.  There they answered me that they completely replaced my motherboard, with all the consequences, and they delivered me what they sent from HP.  There are no complaints about the service center.  But there were claims to HP. <br><br><h5>  Debate: </h5><br>  The course of my thoughts was the following: replacement of components during warranty repairs for less productive ones is not a quality repair.  In other words, they gave me a completely different computer, the price of which was significantly lower.  If the warranty repair was not of high quality, then I have every right to terminate the contract of sale with the seller and return the money.  Since the period of 45 days is out, then there was no talk of re-repairing. <br><br>  I left a complaint on the HP website, in which I clearly described the problem, clearly expressed my requirements.  To which, after 3 days, I was given a stunning answer: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúGood afternoon, Oleg.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The manufacturer reserves the right to change the configuration and characteristics of the goods without prior notice, while the functional and quality indicators of the goods do not deteriorate.</i>  <i>After consulting with the technical department, it was found that with the 630m graphics card installed, the quality indicators of the laptop did not deteriorate.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Respectfully,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Specialist in working with customers</i> <i><br></i>  <i>HP Reclamation Department</i> <br><br>  To say that I was outraged - to say nothing.  I realized that HP is keeping its customers for idiots, I corresponded with technical support, pointed to the site of the manufacturer of video cards, where two different video cards <b>had differences by 2-2.5 times in all indicators.</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.nvidia.ru/object/geforce-gt-630m-ru.html">630m</a> and <a href="http://www.nvidia.ru/object/geforce-gt-650m-ru.html">650m</a> <br><br>  I also stated that the manufacturer does not have any right to change the configuration and characteristics of the product during warranty repairs.  There is no information on such conditions on the guarantee coupon or on the deposit receipt.  I received the following answer: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúThey ordered a PC for this device and sent a motherboard with this particular video card, but this <b>does not violate the functional and quality</b> indicators of the product.‚Äù</i> <br><br>  Just unbelieveble.  I was beside myself with indignation.  It turns out that during the repair I can install any kind of components, simply because the manufacturer wanted to save money and fooled the customer.  The thought crept into my head that I was given an overclocked 630th, so that I would feel less of a difference, but this does not change the essence.  For the hundred and fifth time I wrote a reply to tech support that the conditions for the repair were not fulfilled and I demand a break in the sales contract. <br><br><h5>  Counterattack </h5><br>  A couple of days later I was again written from technical support, with a proposal to return the laptop for repair again, where I will be installed 650m.  I categorically refused, well, imagine for yourself: for 45 days they repaired my laptop, then this time it will be another 45 days and it's far from a fact that they will supply me with the hardware that was originally in it.  I already had 45 days to work on the laptop is weaker than mine, and still have as much?  Dismiss.  My requirement remained unchanged: delay in the period of warranty repair, refund. <br><br>  My wife and I, who have a law degree, made up a formal complaint sent to the store and the Federal Service for Supervision (to check the legality of the actions of the employees. It‚Äôs worth noting that the seller (chain of stores) went to meet me and they themselves were perplexed how HP ‚ÄúWe ourselves understand the difference between these two video cards" was such an answer from them. Therefore, I didn‚Äôt have any claims to the seller either. But I still had to express my claims to the seller, and they, in turn, should have returned their de  HP Nigi <br><br><h5>  Decoupling </h5><br>  Within 10 days, this claim was considered by the store, and they, in turn, beat out with HP compensation for the laptop.  We have already begun to collect papers for going to court, as they called from the store and said that I could get my money.  And I could already buy myself another laptop, for almost the same money, but already with 750m. <br><br>  Both in the store and in the service center, the staff wondered how this could even happen, they said that it was a precedent.  In their memory, this has never happened.  I do not disclose the name of the service center and chain stores, as I do not have their consent, and if they want, I can mention them.  But HP employees should be ashamed of the naked lies and incompetence of their employees. <br><br>  Have you repaired your equipment?  Check whether everything is in place;) Keep your checks and packing, and in such a situation you have every chance of getting your money back without even reaching the court. <br><br>  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166217/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166217/</a></p>
