To serve as many users as possible, companies are trying to take the load off the front offices, transferring the processing of documents to the back offices.  For this, the business creates centers - shared services centers or shared service centers, where the processing and verification of documents and data that come from offices that interact with customers takes place. <br><br>  The same approach to organizing the processing of documents is also applied by our customers.  ABBYY products allow you to implement various document processing scenarios, while taking into account the specifics of the company's business processes.  We will talk about several models of shared customer service centers implemented using <a href="http://www.abbyy.ru/flexicapture/%3Futm_source%3DRU%26utm_medium%3DHabrahabr%26utm_campaign%3Dfc%252Cfcengine%26utm_content%3DHabrahabr-2015-5-29">ABBYY FlexiCapture</a> , a solution that allows you to extract data from structured and unstructured documents and store them in company information systems. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Scheme 1. Classic SSC </h1><br>  This is the simplest principle for organizing a document processing center.  Paper scanning takes place in regional offices at the scanning stations (in fact, it‚Äôs just a scanner connected to a computer with a scanning module connected to FlexiCapture or another similar system installed), after which each operator sends the documents for verification. <br><br>  In the processing center, the documents are lined up in a common queue, and verification operators get the documents into work.  Verification operator plays an important role in the system.  He does various checks to make sure that the document is correct, that there are no errors, and also to get quality data that will be convenient to use at the output.  Therefore, ABBYY FlexiCapture provides several roles for operators checking documents.

      <b>The</b> data <b>verification operator</b> checks the uncertainly recognized characters, works with the logical checks of the document, and also checks whether all the necessary documents are collected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2b/cab/c57/c2bcabc57da14c7985edbeb08fd97468.png"><br><br>  <b>The senior verification operator</b> may assign processing tasks for other operators, solves problems that are not described in the instructions, and which inhibit the conveyor processing of documents.  For example, when checking a field with a supplier, the operator does not find this supplier in the connected directory.  In this case, he redirects the documents to the senior operator, and he can call the client who filled out the questionnaire and clarify the data. <br><br>  As a result, each operator in the system performs its role.  Due to processing in the mode of such a ‚Äúconveyor‚Äù, high processing speed is achieved.  After all the necessary checks, the documents are uploaded to the company system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a66/504/ff4/a66504ff45f049d2a0fa05fc514825c0.png"><br><br><h1>  Scheme 2. Individual processing settings for each region </h1><br>  A very popular scenario is when individual settings are applied to the processing of documents, depending on what region they come from - after all, each region may have its own set of suppliers, addresses, and a different number of necessary documents. <br><br>  Just as in the previous version, documents are scanned at offices in various cities, then sent to the SSC, where they undergo various checks.  But the types of these checks will be different for documents from different regions: logical check rules, their dictionaries (they are connected to improve recognition quality, or again to compare recognized information with them), methods and purpose of uploading documents.  If it is known that different volumes of incoming documents are expected from different regions, it is necessary to distribute the flows, assigning a greater number of verifiers to check documents of certain regions. <br><br>  Thus, Raiffeisenbank centralized the recognition of documents: all payment documents on paper, scanned at regional service points, are recognized in Moscow.  Images of documents are submitted for verification to employees of the specially designed cost optimization center in Yaroslavl, and after checking the correctness, all data is automatically exported to the ruiff payments system of Raiffeisenbank. <br><br><h1>  Scheme 3. Confidentiality in the processing of documents </h1><br>  When working with clients' documents, companies take care of data integrity and confidentiality.  This is especially important for banks, because their customers bring sets of documents containing their personal information and personal data.  ABBYY FlexiCapture allows you to implement a script that will ensure complete security of customer data. <br><br>  How it works.  The client brings a set of documents for a loan: a passport, certificate of employment, application form and so on.  Banks seek to give a decision on granting a loan as quickly as possible - otherwise the customer may go to competitors.  To do this, a bank employee scans the entire stack of documents and sends them to FlexiCapture.  After verifying the completeness of the documents, the scanned and recognized packet is sent to the SSC. <br><br>  The main difference from the already described methods of organizing the OTSO is that each document from the set falls into a separate verification operator.  No operator can see the complete set of documents, which ensures the confidentiality of data.  At the same time, each operator always receives the same type of documents for checking (for example, a passport) and as a result he has studied it well, therefore it processes packages of such documents very quickly.  And as we said before, speed in processing is very important.  After checking the entire set of data sent to the bank system, and the system gives its ‚ÄúOK‚Äù for a loan.  Of course, if the client has a good credit history. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bd/2ee/202/9bd2ee2029314cedb3c3f4c68e1776ed.png"><br><br><h1>  Scheme 4. And yet the front office </h1><br>  Often, companies need to handle small sets of documents in the presence of the client.  This could be, for example, a contract that the field insurance agent must sign, check and enter into the system while he is near the client.  In this case, the FlexiCapture document input web station is used, which allows you to access the DataCapture functionality from the web interface (supported by different browsers - Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Firefox).  The input operator will need only a scanner and a laptop or mobile phone with access to the Internet.  After scanning, the document is sent to the server, recognized, the correctness of the document is checked (recognition quality check, field check of reference books, completeness check, etc.), after which the document is sent to the company system. <br><br>  In such a scenario, the recognition of documents takes place on the server, so it runs as quickly as in the classic distributed workflow. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a7/3c0/445/7a73c044597a41bb950015de596a9ed5.png"><br><br>  For example, a solution based on ABBYY FlexiCapture with document scanning web stations is deployed at the points of sale of Alfa Bank‚Äôs partner companies.  Especially for the project, a thin client for scanning documents was developed - a web application that does not require software installation and can be run on any computer via an Internet browser.  Scanning settings can be managed centrally, which allows you to get scan-images of documents of the desired quality and reduce administration costs by the bank. <br><br>  Due to the centralization and automation of the interaction process between Alfa-Bank and the offices of partner companies, the processing speed of documents has increased 3 times, and the number of errors in the data obtained has been significantly reduced.  In addition, it was possible to free the employees of the offices of partner companies and the bank from part of the routine operations, which allowed them to devote more time to solving specialized tasks. <br><br>  After the introduction of the system, the partners had the opportunity to control the processing of documents at all stages.  The management of the partner companies may receive various reports, for example, to see at what stage of the coordination the documents are located, which employees of sales points make the most mistakes. <br><br>  Whichever scheme a customer service center organization chooses a company, the creation of such a structure will have a positive effect on the business, since it allows discussing customers faster, reducing the cost of this service and creating additional jobs in the regions. <br><br>  Anastasia Evstratova, <br>  ABBYY Russia Corporate Projects Department </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/259089/">https://habr.com/ru/post/259089/</a></p>
