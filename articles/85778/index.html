  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe program for learning English</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago I had an idea how to qualitatively improve and consolidate my knowledge of a foreign language.  I want to share it below.  Perhaps the idea itself is far from new and, perhaps, it has long been implemented in one form or another, then I will be grateful for the tip and the links.  I myself have so far failed to find anything like it. <br>  Further in the text, for simplicity, I will speak about English, but instead of the word "English" you can substitute any other foreign language, the meaning will not change. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The essence of my idea is as follows.  I think many would agree that one of the best ways to increase the level of understanding of spoken English is to watch foreign films, listen to audio books or podcasts in English.  If we talk about understanding the language in general, then you can add articles, newspapers, regular books, blogs, etc. to this list.  The more we read and listen - the better our intuition language understanding skill will be developed without resorting to ‚Äútranslation in the head‚Äù. <br>  But the main problem of learning by this method is that when we meet unfamiliar words or phrases in a new text, we have to be distracted from reading a book (watching a movie) and crawl into the dictionary for translation.  And if in the case of text, the periodic ‚Äúinterruption to the dictionary‚Äù can still be endured (although this can be a very annoying factor with a large percentage of unfamiliar vocabulary), then in the case of a movie or audiobook, frequent interruptions simply kill the whole desire to continue watching or listening. <br>  Therefore, it seems to me that it would be very nice to be able to know in advance what unfamiliar words (or even grammar rules) will occur in the film being watched (the book being read).  After that, you can study in detail all the unknown vocabulary and grammar and calmly tackle your favorite thing, without being distracted already in each new paragraph into unknown expressions. <br><br>  Thinking about this, I decided to create a small program that could do the following: <ul><li>  Accept English text for input (subtitles of the film can also be used as text); </li><li>  to find in the text unfamiliar to the user phrases and, possibly, grammatical structures; </li><li>  automatically translate all new words and phrases found (for example, using Google Translate); </li><li>  be able to memorize words that the user has already learned. </li></ul>  The principle of the application itself seems to me like this: <br>  The program has several dictionaries.  One big one is the main one, which contains all the words learned by the user, the rest are training words that are tied to a specific text, and the unfamiliar vocabulary found in the texts just falls into them.  After the user has learned the word (a) from any educational dictionary, he marks it as ‚Äúfamiliar,‚Äù and the word is automatically entered into the main dictionary.  In the future, when scanning new texts, the program will no longer take into account the words learned and will only select new and unfamiliar ones that are not yet in the main dictionary. <br><br>  Naturally, you also need to think about the various functions of working with dictionaries.  Those.  about the possibility of printing, self-checking and other "goodies", but these are nuances.

      The opinion of the Habrasoobshchestvo about this idea is interesting.  Perhaps, someone will be able to advise any algorithms or libraries for text analysis (I mean grammar), since I myself did not have to work with such tasks myself.  At the first stage, I think the main problem is to find stable expressions in the text of the ‚Äúgo out‚Äù type.  Since the words constituting such phrases do not have to be next to each other, and it is not immediately obvious that they are a solid grammatical construction. <br><br>  I will be glad to your comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85778/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85778/</a></p>
