  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Google again has problems with personal data laws and European lawmakers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There‚Äôs no end to the epic with Google, which seems to be unintentional, but it has collected a lot of users' personal data through their avtomobilchiki, photographing the streets and faces for the Google Street View project.  With the cartographic data, a lot of data fell into the hands of the corporation, which, as it turned out, was collected for several months, and about 6 terabytes of such data were collected.  You can imagine the scale.  In Canada, the first to notice that Google collects this data, and immediately began the proceedings.  Google had to admit its guilt, although at first it was somehow not recognized, and Canada did not insist on litigation.  But now, apart from Canada, other countries have joined the analysis of the situation. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Today, the UK government has announced that it is starting its own investigation, since Google has committed several violations of the Data Protection Act.  True, the investigation will end peacefully anyway, since the same officials promised not to penalize the company if it signs an agreement, where it promises never-never to do so again.  It is clear that Google will have to sign such documents. <br><br>  It is worth noting that last month, apart from Canada, the investigation began Spain, then other countries joined, which are now analyzing this incident with the leakage of users' personal data.  In Europe, they are even going to revise one of the most well-known laws - the ‚ÄúEuropean Data Protection Directive‚Äù.  This directive is almost 15 years old, so it‚Äôs really worth reviewing.

      Google says a thousand times that data was collected by mistake, and in general, all such data is very fragmented, plus it is encrypted in most cases.  Nevertheless, the European Commissioners are investigating the matter further, trying to prevent a repetition of this situation.  Understandably, nobody wants their own credentials from the <s>site with the strawberry</s> mail service fell into the hands of the attacker. <br><br>  By the way, it is interesting, but what if a similar error was made by Microsoft?  For some reason it seems to me that the European judges would be far from being so sympathetic, and instead of threatening with their fingers, they would fine small ones to such an amount that they would have to be tough.  What do you think? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107541/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107541/</a></p>
