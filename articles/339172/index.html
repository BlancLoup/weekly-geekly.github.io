  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Online consultants: a test review of 7 popular systems. What do you get if you fold advertising?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Listen up.  On the market raised the next tehnohip.  Bitcoins, mining, artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks, chat bots, omnicanality.  The minds are absorbed by technology, despite the fact that the vast majority of Russian companies do not even have a normal CRM. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/58/59d25825b7c6c823754911.png"></div><br>  What am I talking about?  When you are a salesman in the company ‚ÄúVasya Pupkin and Co.‚Äù, you wanted to sneeze on high technologies, even if you yourself work in a large IT company.  I want to sell more (equal) to get more interest (equal) to make money on a luxury vacation somewhere in Bali (ideally, dump it there for a while). <br><br>  Orders come to our company by phone and e-mail (where applications from our site also arrive).  After several webinars and a trip to the conference to increase online sales, I suggested that management work more closely with chat.  Of course, I was met with skepticism - several years ago they had already put an online consultant on the site and there was no particular effect.  As a result, until recently, a free version of the chat hung on the site, in which even customers sometimes wrote, but no staff member was ever online.  Almost all managers in the department resisted this ‚Äúextra work‚Äù, in their opinion chat is the fifth wheel in the cart.  But I was persistent: after all, a little more than a year ago, my place of work was the developer company of a fairly well-known chat, and I had several weighty case studies of companies that raised sales in this way.  I knew that there were no miracles in this, it was necessary only to correctly integrate chat into the company's business processes.  But over the year, there have been many changes in the industry that I wanted to touch first, in order to understand how to work with them. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Especially testing, I did not think through.  I started with Bitrix, he did not suit me, and it went on.  As a result, the excitement captured, because  interesting details began to emerge.  I did not want to let myself be ‚Äúdivorced‚Äù, I had to check many, many chat services.  I didn‚Äôt receive enthusiasm from my colleagues, as you can imagine (but at least they didn‚Äôt interfere), and it took almost 3 months for tests. <br><br>  The list of services I checked: Bitrix24, Jivosite, Redhelper, Webconsult, Livetex, Streamwood, Siteheart. <br><br>  I will start with Bitrix, because we used their CRM for a very long time, including when we started the test, we were on it (but we were already preparing for the transition to our solution).  In addition, Bitrix has a built-in chat for communicating with site visitors, and it was ideal to start with them in order to understand what details I should pay attention to. <br><br><h2>  Bitrix24 </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.bitrix24.ru/">Bitriks24</a> designate itself as omnichanal CRM (i.e. CRM, where there are all sorts of channels through which the client can write to the company).  To provide this very omni-channel should be ‚ÄúOpen lines‚Äù - chat, callback, social networks and instant messengers.  Bitrix has a free version (interesting for CRM users, but of little interest for those who are looking for channels to communicate with potential buyers - they give only 1 channel to choose from).  The number of open lines per test is not limited (by the way, the test period is as long as 30 days), we, as clients, were given the opportunity to test any channels for free, but we limited ourselves to chatting, VKontakte and Facebook (since there is no need anymore). <br><br>  All channels connected quickly and easily, although in general the logic seemed to me a bit overloaded.  It turned out that bitrix managers themselves do not know until the end how to set up the normal operation of new channels.  For example, I was given the wrong instructions for replacing the standard greeting in the chat open lines.  I had to look for myself. <br><br>  In the settings of auto-invites, there is only one greeting template and the ability to set a timeout for its delay.  Also, this greeting can be closed for display on some pages (which I did - I conducted the test on several key pages of the site with the largest traffic).  In principle, for small sites this will be enough, but we ran into problems almost immediately - some pages of our site have a very different viewing depth (like the content itself) and in an amicable way, we should create a separate invitation for such pages and set a separate time. his appearance.  This cannot be done in Bitrix.  Those.  main sales tool died in the bud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/58/59d25825b6865808781141.png"><br><br>  What is absolutely impossible to put up with - the connection is constantly terminated and the connection is restored (when you use CRM it is not so noticeable, but when working with clients it became critical).  As a result, I am writing and cannot send a message to the client, because  forced to wait for the restoration of communication.  The audit showed that the same was happening on the client‚Äôs side. <br><br>  There is a history of communication with customers (also part of this omni-channel), it is stored inside the CRM itself and downloaded into a huge excel file, where the correspondence should be read, following the links (i.e. it is not possible to take fluently within the CRM itself see what was previously communicated with the client).  How do they imagine the use of such correspondence?  My client is hanging and waiting for an answer, I do not have time to scour the correspondence and look for what this client was interested in earlier.  Those.  omnichanalnaya CRM was just a CRM with a chat and several channels to choose from. <br><br>  <b>Summary:</b> in fact, it's still CRM and a tool for scheduling tasks.  To communicate with customers and benefit, it is not very suitable.  The price, if you have a large team and you want to connect many channels, also bites. <br><br>  Of the benefits - it is a chat solution, combined with CRM.  All in one box. <br><br><h2>  Jivosite </h2><br>  <a href="https://www.jivosite.ru/">Jivosite</a> is the most popular consultant on the market, there is a free version that has been hanging on our site for a long time.  Opportunities in it are greatly curtailed, so you should not count heavily on it, there is also a limit on the number of employees - up to 5 people.  In addition, for large companies, it may be a matter of prestige to use a free tool that is found on many sites (and ‚Äúeveryone knows that this is one of the cheapest solutions on the market, even in the paid version‚Äù - a quote from one of my colleagues).  I personally did not embarrass the last moment, as long as the software worked and solved its tasks efficiently. <br><br>  One of the advantages is a convenient personal account, simple and fast connection of all the necessary channels (testili chat again for the site, Vkontakte and Facebook).  A convenient operator application, where, by the way, the manager‚Äôs response history is accumulated and a list of his personal quick answers is generated in order to answer typical questions more quickly (a very ill-conceived functionality, since the system itself decides what to save - including typographical errors). <br><br>  Reports for each dialogue come in the mail (for someone it is convenient, but personally it began to annoy me when the whole box was littered with these letters: the problem was solved by creating a filter).  It‚Äôs not the most functional and convenient statistics, it‚Äôs inconvenient to work with dialogs (I like to view the communication history at the end of the working day and it‚Äôs more convenient for me to do it in the personal account of the system itself, not in the mail - so I can use filters and quickly evaluate how members worked teams).  In addition, the history of communication with customers is only 60 days.  Perhaps the latter has become critical for us, because  in our case, the sales cycle can reach half a year, nobody has canceled work with loyal customers either.  Plus, integration with our new CRM is estimated to be technically difficult and costly. <br><br>  Of the minuses - this widget can easily show offline mode, even if you have 2 operators online (several times you had to check the site‚Äôs work, because we didn‚Äôt receive applications, and in the mail they were lost and added an extra load to the work).  There are shortcomings with auto-prompts - when setting up a specific script for a specific page address, the system continued to show the user a default invitation (the tech support tried to solve this case, but in the end everything somehow died out).  In general, it is necessary to note that there are a lot of script settings, there are almost all client catch options that can be useful in work (although such a seductive AB-test script does not work yet - there are no statistics and it is impossible to understand which scenario is better in the end). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/58/59d25825e9e0b888673733.png"><br><br>  In the Jivosite settings, there is also a omni-channel section, where all available channels are connected (including instant messengers and social networks).  In the general understanding of omni-channel, the operator should see the previous history of the client's communication with the company (regardless of the channel from which the client turned).  In fact, in the Zhivosayt application, the manager does not even see the previous correspondence with the client, who returns to the site on the same day after some time.  Moreover, if the client himself writes to the manager, then the story periodically still gets to the operator, but if the operator writes, then the dialogue always starts from scratch.  The same goes for fixing the client‚Äôs history in your account ‚Äî the system will not replenish one client card (even if, for example, it leaves the same phone number each time), it will always create different requests and different correspondence branches in the history.  The reality is that you will never know that this is one and the same client (especially in real conditions, when a client comes and writes to the chat window and needs to react quickly).  Understandably, with social networks the story is even worse.  Through them, notifications to the client do not come every time. <br><br>  <b>Summary:</b> In general, the impression was that the system is unstable.  When you work in a chat one - the disadvantages are not so noticeable, but when scaled, they become more than obvious.  Also, if you need non-integrated integration with CRM, it is better to look for another solution (in the end, it may be cheaper). <br><br>  One of the advantages is still one of the cheapest solutions on the market, so go ahead, if you are not afraid to lose in sales due to the instability of the software. <br><br><h2>  Redhelper </h2><br>  It was in <a href="https://redhelper.ru/">Redhelper that</a> I once worked, their chat became the third in my test and the first where there were no social networks and instant messengers (I cannot say that we especially need them, but for the purity of the experiment it would be nice).  But in its stability, the service did not give doubt even once.  With a simple external design inside there are many functions such as co-browsing (this is an opportunity to see the site through the eyes of the client and tell him where to look at the information).  I also really like the function of displaying a list of site visitors (who can be actively invited to chat - that is, you can choose from, say, those who are not on the site for the first time or browse the conversion page and send them an offer to help). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/58/59d25825edbb5986320891.png"><br><br>  As experience shows, in Redhelper this function also works fine - if a visitor is online on the site, he shows up with the status ‚Äúonline‚Äù until the end of the session, and does not fall off after 10-20 seconds (spoiler: this is what Webconsult does).  Those who want to work with this chat will be pleased with the extensive settings of auto-invitations to chat (they can ‚Äúclose‚Äù almost any sales needs).  The system also sends beautiful reports to the post office with schedules of how successfully the consultants have worked today.  Frequency can be customized. <br>  Also, it is actively recommended to connect a callback (there is a free version, it is installed by default on the site along with the chat, and it cannot be removed without contacting technical support or paying the corresponding tariff).  This was not part of the basic task, so we did not test its integration into the business process.  In addition, statistics on chat and callback need to look in two different tabs in your personal account, which is not always convenient. <br><br>  I didn‚Äôt like that the test period lasts only 5 days (life hacking - through the manager it can be significantly extended).  The appearance of the operator‚Äôs application and personal account is rather austere, the settings are only the most basic.  A good mobile operator application.  In this case, the tariffs for the system are not the lowest - for access to the API, necessary for integration with CRM, you will have to pay about 1,850 rubles.  for each operator. <br><br>  <b>Summary: a</b> good option for small companies that need active sales and do not require special inclusion of chat in other processes of the company - the history of correspondence is not needed, for example, and just basic statistics on the work of managers is enough.  The tariff may not be so high, if you wait - at the end of each month I receive letters with discounts, there is no free version of chat for business here. <br><br><h2>  Webconsult </h2><br>  These guys hooked me up in advertising.  At <a href="https://consultsystems.ru/">Webconsult</a> I liked the design of their widgets, in addition, it is very different from everything that is currently on the market.  Also, in addition to chatting and ordering a call, you can use the module with contact information where you can take the location of the office, phone numbers and so on.  However, I didn‚Äôt notice any special wave of dialogues from clients with this widget, rather the opposite. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/58/59d258262e93c678595377.png"><br><br>  The operator's application is convenient, similar to Zhivosayt or Livetex, and can work either directly from the browser or installed on the desktop.  If in the course of the correspondence the client needs to move away from the computer, he can continue the correspondence from the mobile (simply by scanning the QR code).  I didn‚Äôt like the auto-invitations settings here - the appearance of the script is possible only at the address of the page and only the total delay before the appearance is configured (as in Bitrix).  The list of visitors generally works very incorrectly - if the user does not move the mouse for 20-30 seconds, he disappears from the operator from the list of visitors (and appears there again only after refreshing the page).  I wrote it in fat minus. <br><br>  I also want to pay attention to the tariffing - there is a greatly reduced free tariff, for each additional site (if you have several of them), you will have to pay the disk space and the period for storing the correspondence separately (for the correspondence from the mobile too).  For integration with our CRM voiced simply unrealistic amount and some kind of space period, which immediately reduced all enthusiasm to zero. <br><br>  <b>Summary: the</b> service, for my taste, is beautiful, but the same Redhelper copes better with the basic tasks of consulting.  Plus for this money it is more profitable to take Livetex (he is next on our test, now I will explain why). <br><br><h2>  Livetex </h2><br>  I also knew <a href="https://livetex.ru/">Livetex</a> for quite a long time, both in my personal experience and through webinars, but I was confused by the price and the way of setting the tariffs (it‚Äôs not clear why you should overpay).  After registering, the manager almost immediately called, constantly coming (and still coming) rather sensible letters with educational materials.  In fact, it was useful, since not all the settings are intuitive (it‚Äôs harder to figure out here than Live).  There are a lot of channels for communication: classics (chat, call, offline application), social networks, instant messengers, email and even chat in a mobile application (if you have it, customers can write to you directly from the application).  I needed only a chat and an application, but the test channels are not limited, so I also checked work with vkontakte and Facebook. <br><br>  The results of the system test: a good operator application (but there is no mobile application, to the question ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù Answer that ‚Äúit‚Äôs difficult to provide customer service at the right level from the mobile and on the run‚Äù), sometimes you have to dig into your personal account in your personal account, but quickly you get used to it.  In addition, there is always a manager or tech support in touch who orient. <br><br>  Here I want to highlight the most detailed analytics on the work of managers with clients that I met on the tests - any indicators are analyzed, starting with the operator‚Äôs working time and ending with how many messages come through each channel, various filters are configured to generate the necessary reports for any period and by any indicators (although reports cannot be sent to the mail, there is only an export function).  According to such statistics, it is easy to develop motivation for managers (this is for a note to sales managers) and make sure that customers are answered clearly, competently and according to the script (as we like).  I also appreciated the convenience of working with the history of dialogues - it is displayed for each client in the form of chains, it is convenient to read and draw conclusions about the question the client came up with and how it was served (all that is missing is a keyword search, but the categorization of calls is implemented - these categories are created by the administrator and can be assigned by the operator to each dialogue - for example, was this a sale or a question about a missing product - any cases). <br><br>  We also liked the settings of the scenarios and the display of statistics on them (how many times the script was shown per day - you can at least navigate if the scripts work at all or not).  But we must admit that the number of variations in the settings of the scripts themselves in Jivosayt is greater. <br><br>  I especially want to note the ability of the platform to form a complete client card using contact information (for example, the client writes from the social network, indicating his phone number in the text, and the system automatically shows the manager his previous correspondence from the chat, mail, even call orders, and that‚Äôs all on the fly "Right when receiving a message from the client and right in the operator window).  True, in the history of dialogues such a merger takes place only the next day (and then all the statistics are updated), but in the long term, these opportunities are very impressive.  Alas, the opportunity to go from the chat, say, to another channel during correspondence is not implemented.  For the client it would be convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/58/59d2582631f66015145686.png"><br><br>  Integration with CRM here also required the purchase of a more expensive tariff, but we were assured that the integration process itself was strongly supported by technical support and would not be worth the extra money. <br><br>  <b>Summary:</b> good service with fairly high prices, which, however, justify themselves with functionality and the lack of additional payments ‚Äúon trifles‚Äù (chat history is stored indefinitely, for example).  The real ability to manage the sales process and control managers, the ability to build high-quality customer service and maintain loyalty. <br><br><h2>  Streamwood </h2><br>  Before I begin to describe the impressions of the service itself, I‚Äôll note the alarming thing - they have not answered the managers on the site and the technical support is silent.  None of my requests to <a href="https://streamwood.ru/">Streamwood</a> have been answered.  This is strange. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/58/59d258267c91d228560830.png"><br><br>  With a strange design (and when loading the operator‚Äôs application at the bottom there is a horn inscription ‚ÄúFlow of Tree‚Äù), this is a service with good stuff.  Here, a good basic functionality is declared, there is a priority distribution of messages to managers (it works, however, once), it is possible to assign a name to the contact and transfer it directly to the CRM (if there is integration) directly from the operator‚Äôs application, many settings for the appearance of the widgets (chat and callback ).  There are interesting marketing opportunities - such as lead-form and pop-up for placement of shares (but all this is paid for separately and in the total result it is not clear whether it will be very effective). <br><br>  Of the minuses - the lack of communication with the company and any support, for auto-invitations - setting only at the page address, you can also add a delay in the appearance of greetings from the visitor‚Äôs entry to the site and the delay in reappearing.  Widgets themselves are very large and intrusive (a call order is opened on a third of a page, which really enrages and says ‚ÄúRun!‚Äù).  I tried to set up two different scripts on two different pages - when creating the second one I gave an error saying ‚ÄúThis script already exists‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Summary: an</b> attractive, but not always correctly working, service with missing support and strange design of widgets (although someone might like building themes - for example, for wooden architecture, the style will definitely fit).  The price tag is also not the most humane - only for the chat you will have to pay 800r per month (and if you buy all the modules that they offer - like an auction and a registrar, it will be more expensive than the others). <br><br><h2>  Siteheart </h2><br>  The <a href="http://www.siteheart.com/">Siteheart service</a> immediately <a href="http://www.siteheart.com/">got</a> out of the general line and showed great promise - to connect a chat bot to answer all standard questions and translate requests to managers only when the bot blunted and failed - it seems very convenient.  Plus, payments via chat are interesting to all online stores, a useful thing (by the way, Jivosite has integration with the Yandex Kasse).  Having rolled up my sleeves, I decided to turn the brain on to its fullest potential, set up my first chat bot and enjoy life when ‚Äúthe bot is working and I am resting‚Äù. <br><br>  It was not there - I was offered a modest instruction on setting up (for a couple of leaves from the presentation), after studying which I could not do something more or less adequate.  The logic of the answers did not work, I even turned to our admin for advice, and he called for help from familiar developers, but the bot refused to work as it should.  When I tried to contact technical support for help, I had great difficulty in reaching the operator, who, in turn, could not help me with anything sensible.  It seems that it is better not to rely on the capabilities of neural networks, but to give the opportunity to respond in the chat to live people.  So, at least, the client will not immediately leave your site and there is hope for the birth of the transaction.  If someone is working with this system or setting it up himself - share in the comments, I even wonder how you did it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/d2/58/59d2582664b93487098376.png"><br><br>  <b>Summary:</b> contact only if you are 100% sure that you need it.  If, for example, you have a lot of typical questions in the chat (what a conclusion can be made only after six months or a year of regular work with this tool).  It is inexpensive, but here it is necessary to include the cost of your time to set up and possible support for programmers. <br><br><h2>  Instead of conclusion </h2><br>  As a result, I do not have some 100% favorite.  There were some good options for the test, however, not all of them came up to us in terms of functionality and settings (and in the process of final approval several other requirements emerged from the general, so the short list was still reduced).  Now we have decided to stop at Livetex and we are testing how our conversion has changed after installing the chat.  Why I chose this particular service, I will write a little later, in order to show on real numbers, there is a sense from this or advertising deceives us. <br><br>  One thing I can say for sure - none of the services tell us the truth in advertising and at the stage of sale.  Somewhere, the discrepancies turned out to be colossal, somewhere they were almost absent, but definitely, you need to check these services with passion.  I hope my conclusions will be useful to someone and will be able to save time when choosing a service. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/339172/">https://habr.com/ru/post/339172/</a></p>
