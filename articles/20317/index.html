  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3 ways to increase visitor loyalty with content</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you know how much time the user spends on a preliminary assessment of the site after it is loaded?  To assess whether it is worth looking for the information you need on your website here and now?  One twentieth of a second.  This is a critically small value.  Consequently, there are only three things that can keep his attention: a memorable design, high-quality structure, which in one instant will lead the user to the desired point of his journey through the site, or interesting, conspicuous content.  Here we will talk about it. <br><br>  As experience has shown, in our difficult time filled with terrabytes of information, users have become lazy and biased.  An article more than a couple of pages should simply be a discovery in its field, so that more than half of users read it to the end, and the joke should be really funny so that it can be sent to each other.  Hell has come for content managers and a paradise for sites like news2.ru or digg.com, where lazy users are already waiting for specially approved other users, which means obviously interesting content.  (Even if it was not ordinary users who approved it, but SMO-optimizers, hired to promote this or that site in web 2.0 resources).  Information is more and less time.  &lt;&gt; <br><br>  <b>N ways ...</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      When it turned out that there was so much information, and so little time, users began to need simple solutions that would allow getting results in the shortest time possible.  Why did you click on the title of this post?  Because I promised you in two seconds to tell you about 3 simple ways how to make visitors more loyal.  You are a victim of time constraints and promises to solve your problems in a few seconds.  Your visitors will also be willing to click on the titles of articles titled ‚Äú6 ways to make any woman fall in love‚Äù (it's so easy - read the article and solve the problem), ‚Äú25 ways to quit smoking‚Äù (well, one out of 25 will work!) 4 ways to live up to 100 years "(it‚Äôs better to read, all of a sudden what is important!).  But the most important thing is that you really offer visitors interesting ways to solve problems that target your site.  I am proud of my vanity that someone may be interested in my notes. <br><br>  <b>Study</b> <br><br>  If users are not offered solutions to problems, then they are satisfied with a summary of what was said earlier in one place.  In this case, it is likely that users will add your page to the "Favorites" or add to the online bookmarks.  Collect in one place all the links to sites of popular subjects (for example, sites of great designers), or conduct large-scale research on how to increase user loyalty.  You will have to spend a little time, however, you will do a useful job, for which users will thank you, because they will not waste time on the same work. <br><br>  <b>Transfer</b> <br><br>  We have to admit that the English-language Internet is much more saturated than ours.  A huge number of entrepreneurs, scientists, writers, artists, politicians, etc.  have their own blogs, in which they communicate with fans or just interested people.  Even the head of the venture fund Paul Graham has his blog, and thanks to this blog he has become known to the whole world.  And thanks to Paul Graham, those who were the first to translate his notes about online business became known to the whole RuNet.  Translate interesting materials, publish them first, post them through blogs and forums, and visitors will be drawn to you. <br><br>  Again: because you are doing the work that they would like to do, but there is no time. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20317/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20317/</a></p>
