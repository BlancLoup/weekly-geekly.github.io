Where did the child go, with whom is he now, did he not get lost, did he not get into a bad situation?  These questions parents often ask themselves, but the answer is quite difficult to get.  In any case, it was before. <br><br>  Now there is a whole class of high-tech devices, which are called "smart watches".  These are gadgets that can perform many useful functions besides showing time.  For children and parents have their own devices of this type, which help to be in touch, even in an emergency.  In the first part of the compilation, we talked about the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/madrobots/blog/283638/">most popular ones</a> , but the market for children's watches is rapidly growing and developing, giving us new and improved models.

      The history of these bright hours began with crowdfunding sites.  Following the two campaigns on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dokiwatch/dokiwatch-the-worlds-most-advanced-smartwatch-for">Kickstarter</a> and <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/dokiwatch-world-s-most-advanced-kids-smartwatch">IndieGoGo, they</a> managed to raise more than $ 700,000 for production.  At the moment, manufacturers send watches to all backers, so in Russia they will appear no earlier than November. <br><br>  Externally, the watch looks like an Apple Watch, hidden in a robust silicone case that protects fragile electronics from damage.  The display at the watch is color, touch, in the upper part there is a camera with a matrix of 2 MP for making video calls. <br><br>  The functions of the device are conveniently controlled using special buttons.  So, on the left side of the case is the SOS button, on the right - the power and navigation buttons on the menu.  Under the display is a microphone. <br><br>  The battery capacity of 600 mAh will last for a day and a half of the device.  In addition, Doki Watch is equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth modules, not to mention the GPS module. <br><br>  Hours allow you to send voice and text messages, make video calls and receive them.  You can set the boundaries of the movement of the child, in case of going beyond which the parent receives a notification.  In an emergency, the child can press and hold the SOS button for 3 seconds, after which the microphone is activated on the clock, which ‚Äúlistens‚Äù to everything that happens around.  The recording lasts 60 seconds, after which it is sent to the list of contacts stored in the clock, along with the coordinates. <br><br>  The watch has an application called DokiPet, which allows you to use the watch as a fitness tracker.  The more the child moves, the bigger and stronger the Doki-animal in the application becomes.  The number of steps, calories burned and distance covered are taken into account. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Width: 40 mm; </li><li>  The maximum size of the wrist: 180 mm; </li><li>  Weight: 60 g; </li><li>  Display: 1.22 ", TFT touchscreen display, 240x240 pixels; </li><li>  Processor: MediaTek MT6572M, 2 cores, 1.3 GHz; </li><li>  RAM: 512 MB; </li><li>  Built-in memory: 4 GB; </li><li>  Built-in battery: lithium-polymer, 600 mAh; </li><li>  Work time: 36 hours; </li><li>  Standby time: 60 hours; </li><li>  Compatibility: iOS 7.0+, Android 4.0+; </li><li>  Built-in modules: GPS, GSM; </li><li>  Application: Doki app; </li><li>  Wireless interfaces: Bluetooth 4.0, Wi-Fi 802.11n, 3G (1900/2100); </li><li>  SIM slot: micro-SIM; </li><li>  Band material: hypoallergenic silicone. </li></ul><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Determination of coordinates; </li><li>  The ability to make video calls; </li><li>  Functionality. </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Cumbersome; </li><li>  Expensive (expected cost of 15 000 p.). </li></ul><br><h3>  ELARI FIXITIME 2 </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/063/2d7/f65/0632d7f653b0a3a67cf7666573ee520a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  This watch got its name in honor of the famous cartoon series about "Fixico".  If the child likes this cartoon, the clock will definitely appeal to him.

They have a bright display with a diagonal of 0.98 inches.  The case is impact resistant, unlike glass, so be careful with this. <br><br>  Like previous models, there is a SOS button on the side and two buttons for calling parents at once.  Plus, there is a sensor removing the clock.  The fact is that some children voluntarily take off the clock, and parents cannot find out about it.  And here immediately comes a warning that the beloved child has decided to remove the gadget. <br><br>  The watch is equipped with a GPS tracker and accelerometer.  The display shows the current status, incoming calls, battery level and other necessary information. <br><br>  Using the software, you can determine the location of the child, set geo-zones, as well as learn the history of the movement of the child.  The clock can also be used as a cell phone, they are equipped with a speaker and a microphone.  Parents can remotely control the alarm clock. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Weight: 35 g; </li><li>  Size: 52 √ó 31 √ó 12 mm; </li><li>  Screen: 0.98 "OLED display; </li><li>  Frequency: GSM 900/1800; </li><li>  SIM card: Micro SIM; </li><li>  Tracker: GPS / LBS; </li><li>  Battery Capacity: 400 mAh; </li><li>  Standby time: up to 4 days; </li><li>  Talk time: 360 minutes; </li><li>  Support: OS: iOS 6.0 and higher; </li><li>  Android 4.0 and up </li><li>  Waterproof: resistant to moisture: water drops / splashes; </li><li> Other functions: pick-up sensor, built-in speaker, microphone, accelerometer, GPS antenna, GSM antenna; </li><li>  Package weight: 110 g </li></ul><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Large color display; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Soft bracelet; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Sensor removing the clock; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Pedometer. <br><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Fragile glass; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Ability to record a total of 2 numbers. <br><br><h3>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/elari-kidphone/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dwatches">Elari KidPhone</a> </h3><br><img src="https://www.hitechnation.ru/f/product/KidPhone_rakurs_1_logo_116.jpg"><br><br>  This is an easy-to-use model of children's watches, which allows parents to always be aware of where the child is.  The device supports calls, so you can call your son or daughter at any time.  In this case, you can block all incoming calls, except for authorized numbers.  As a result, spammers and scammers on the number of the child will not get through.  If necessary, the child can use the SOS function. <br><br>  The clock is controlled by a free application for iOS / Android.  If desired, parents can deactivate all the smart watch functions at the time of the child‚Äôs study.  Among the functions, except for SOS, there is a pedometer, alarm clock, answering machine and monitoring sounds. <br><br>  Despite the fact that there is a tracking function here, this is not GPS, but LBS tracking.  This is the location of the cell towers LBS.  In this case, the positioning error is higher than in the case of a conventional GPS module (up to 500 meters). <br><br>  The clock has a slot for installing a micro-SIM card, GSM 900/1800 frequencies and GPRS voice communication are supported. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Type: smart watches; </li><li>  Country of origin: China; </li><li>  Model: KP-1; </li><li>  Supported operating system: Android 4.x, Android 5.x, Android 6.x, iOS; </li><li>  Screen diagonal: 1.44 "; </li><li>  Matrix technology: TFT; </li><li>  Talk time, h: 6; </li><li>  Standby time, h: 96; </li><li>  Gender: Unisex; </li><li>  Power supply: built-in battery; </li><li>  Battery capacity, mAh: 600; </li><li>  Cable connector: microUSB 2.0; </li><li>  Sizes, mm: 50 x 37 x 18; </li><li>  Packing size (LxWxH), cm: 10 x 10 x 8; </li><li>  Warranty: 1 year; </li><li>  Shipping Weight, g: 190. </li></ul><br>  <b>Pros:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Convenient design; </li><li>  Long working time; </li><li>  The possibility of communication. </li></ul><br>  <b>Minuses:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  No GPS module; </li><li>  A small number of functions. </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/smart-baby-watch-q50/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Dwatches">Smart Baby Watch Q90</a> </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fb5/0c7/2d5/fb50c72d5914e98e090da11e2121e5c8.jpg"><br><br>  Smart Baby Watch Q90 - children's watch, which shows the location of the child in real time.
