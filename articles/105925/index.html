I didn‚Äôt want to upgrade to Beta or Release candidate.  For some reason, I was sure that with the release of the main release, I would have to download and install almost as many updates - I agree, a strange thought, but decided to wait for the main release. <br><br>  And yesterday, the Update Manager issued the cherished line and the Update button. <br><br>  It should be noted that the system is already 2 years old, initially set at 8.04 and gradually and systematically updated to the next releases. <a name="habracut"></a>  And with each update, there were some glitches, linings and fads, which then unraveled and corrected.

      And to myself - I do not suffer from red eye disease, I do not collect the core under me, etc.  being a web programmer, I do not want to climb into the jungle of the system, that's why I chose Ubuntu. <br><br>  Updates in the amount of 2GB flew into the home desktop in 8 minutes (thanks, UA-IX), after which they took two and a half hours.  For comparison, a newer system on a working laptop, where the first system had already put 10.04 updates, was installed 1 GB less, although the approximate list of software on the systems is the same (I work on both computers). <br><br>  After a couple of hours of inspection of the effects of the update, downloaded the image and completely rearranged the system.  Fortunately, 2 years ago, on the advice of a seasoned Linux user, successfully divided the screw into sections. <br><br>  An attempt to update the system failed - gnome glitches surfaced which are closed on the tracker for previous versions.  This turned out to google glitches. <br>  <i>I don‚Äôt give screenshots because</i>  <i>I couldn‚Äôt make them corny, but I didn‚Äôt see the point of photographing the screen, because</i>  <i>then did not think about what to write about it.</i> <br><br>  I admit, I didn‚Äôt really try to fix the glitches that appeared - the main glitch is the endless GNOM launch of its File Manager, which leads to a complete paralysis of the system - the memory is still a car, but the windows are already opening somehow very selectively, if I didn‚Äôt turn it on immediately Google Chrome, then you can no longer try.  But Mozilla Firefox works fine.  <s>And the most annoying - you can not change the background image.</s> <br>  By discussing the gentoo <a href="http://bugs.gentoo.org/show_bug.cgi%3Fid%3D266398">bug tracker</a> , the problem was resolved with the release of GNOME version 2.30, and at 10.10 version 2.32.  Here I realized that I did not want to find a solution. <br><br>  Another glitch turned out to be quite cavalier - the system left without my attention turned on the screen saver and blocked itself.  Attempts to return did not give a result - a black screen and every click with a mouse or a button press led to a brief appearance of the cursor on the screen and that's it.  At the same time, the computer continued to play music properly.  Solved the problem from the console mode by restarting gdm.  Something important and not preserved would be revealed, I would be upset. <br><br>  The result - I downloaded the image of the system and rearranged it.  Funny, but k3b refused to start silently getting out of the taskbar.  The recording worked only through Brasero. <br><br>  The only thing that improved my mood is that I have already installed the <nobr>64-bit</nobr> version, having abandoned the pae-crutch. <br><br><h6>  The moral of this story is: </h6><br>  1) Everything is not so smooth in the ubunt kingdom, as Canonical would like and would like; <br>  2) Ubuntu can live without reinstalling longer than ... "other" OS (I keep quiet about Mac); <br>  3) You need to develop your willpower - do not rush headlong to update, because  it is with an equal degree of probability that it can both improve the work of the system and knock the system out of its working rhythm for 1 or several days, and with it, if you are engaged in its maintenance; <br>  4) There is a lot of sense in creating / home as a separate section.  I saved my desktop, selectively config files, etc .; <br>  5) The installer was very pleased with the ubuntu - when I was still driving in settings like my name and time zone, the installer was already unpacking and downloading system packages from the Internet.  I don‚Äôt know, maybe in other distributions it is already there for a long time, but I was pleasantly surprised. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/105925/">https://habr.com/ru/post/105925/</a></p>
