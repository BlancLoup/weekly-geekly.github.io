  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Crisis communicator or a pleasant device for 4 kilorublya</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Pampering with the Chinese device described in my past <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/47160/">topic a</a> couple of weeks and passing it on to the next, undoubtedly happy owner, I decided that it would be nice to get a communicator.  The fact is that I sold the PDA and somehow I immediately felt its absence, and considering the bad weather outside our windows, I didn‚Äôt want to allocate a lot of diabolical papers for the purchase, and there was no desire to buy a <strike>Chinese</strike> little-functional device.  And then came to the rescue of good old <a href="http://ebay.com/">ebay</a> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Recruitment </h5><br>  Actually, after logging in to ebay, for some reason I entered htc in the search bar, this happened somehow intuitively, probably because.  That I associate it with mobile devices of such a plan.  Further, having studied the proposal, I was interested in a curious device htc 8525, also known as at &amp; t 8525, you can consider this device for example <a href="http://www.mobiletechreview.com/phones/Cingular-8525.htm">here</a> . <br><br><h5>  Specifications </h5><br><img src="http://img132.imageshack.us/img132/4038/mainclearui6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  This device has the following characteristics: <br>  - supported networks: GSM 850 / GSM 900 / GSM 1800 / GSM 1900 / WCDMA 850 / WCDMA 1900 / WCDMA 2100 <br>  - processor: 400 MHz Samsung <br>  - ROM 128 Mb <br>  - RAM 64 Mb <br>  - screen: 2.8 ", LCD (Color TFT / TFD) Resolution: 240 x 320 px (QVGA) Colors: 65,536 (16-bit) <br>  - OS: Windows Mobile Professional (Pocket PC) version 5 <br>  - Communications: Wi-Fi (b, g), Bluetooth 2.0, IR, USB <br>  - Sliding qwerty keyboard

    <h5>  Asking the price </h5><br>  Because  these devices are distributed by the glorious at &amp; t company together with the contracts and remarkably distribute them to their cellular network, for which they have a special ‚Äúthank you‚Äù.  Therefore, you should ask the price of devices marked unlocked.  A little asking about the devices, it was clear that the average unlocked device would cost about 200 green American presidents + 20-40 delivery.  and the result is a sum of about 7 kilo rubles, which in principle is not bad for such a device. <br><br><h5>  Anti-crisis measures </h5><br>  But we will not stop at this price, a crisis is raging outside and it is necessary to minimize expenses.  What immediately comes to mind?  Firstly, for me personally, not a fundamentally new device or used, if the functionality is fully working and the view is more or less presentable, because  all the junk except the device itself and the charger usually gather dust somewhere at home in the corner, so why pay more.  Secondly, the devices without the unlocked tag were very intrigued by me.  they cost a lot cheaper.  If you turn on the brain a little, it is clear that there are unlocked devices.  Someone unlocks them himself.  and if there are people who know how to unlock, then why am I worse?  :) Having rummaged on the Internet, a very interesting <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/">resource</a> was found on communicators of this type and what is most interesting on this resource is a wonderful <a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D293665">unlocker</a> for all devices of this type.  After downloading the archive, it reveals several folders, a couple of text files and one bat file.  Opening the text file it becomes clear that to unlock the device, you need to run the bat file and follow the instructions.  It became clear that it is possible and necessary to save on unlock.  Then, having bargained a little, the device was picked up already for $ 115 from $ 25 in delivery, which was $ 140 and about 4 kilo-ruble at the current rate, on this I consider anti-crisis measures achieved.  Although particularly inquisitive people can sit for a while and bargain, in principle, with a skillful approach, you can knock off another $ 10-20, but somehow I already wanted to use the device.  and not to bargain. <br><br><h5>  Phenomenon </h5><br>  And after 2 weeks comes the cherished notice of the arrival of the parcel (I was always surprised by the fact that the plane with the parcel from America takes off just 2 days after sending, and in Russia it is most likely driven by reindeer sleighs ... but the speed of our mail is subject for a separate conversation).  In the package, as one would expect for a used device, there is the device itself, a new battery and a charger.  What distinguishes American mail from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/47160/">Chinese</a> and shows the level of service, so this is a large box, which contains a large number of bags with pimples !!! <br>  The device itself, as was written in the description, has some traces of use and looks like this: <br><img src="http://img222.imageshack.us/img222/7926/maintz3.jpg"><br><img src="http://img127.imageshack.us/img127/9595/frontiz4.jpg"><br><img src="http://img212.imageshack.us/img212/9135/backsg6.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Start </h5><br>  As it was clear from the very beginning, the device started up remarkably, but only without a sim card, when the alien sim card was stuffed into it, it went into a deep stupor, it was decided to unlock it.  Actually the decision was made, but it did not work out right away,  It turned out that at home only a laptop with a whist, and software from the firmware requires activesync, which is no longer supported in whist.  After the computer with the XP process was found, nothing was complicated, everything was thought out before us, it remains only to monitor the execution of the bat file and follow the instructions described there, only one small problem arose in the process, which was decided by reconnecting the device to the computer, because  during one of the stages the connection was broken.  I would even say unlock was a breeze, because  breathing during it was scary :).  At the end of all the manipulations on the screen, a cheerful inscription began to flaunt that our device was unlocked and in fact, after the reboot, he remarkably ate the sim card from MTS.  HOORAY!!! <br><img src="http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/3229/mtspf2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Actually, we received a working machine for pleasant money, the only negative is the lack of Russification, but this does not bother me at all, and I have ideas for future plans on the Russification of the device.  A detailed review of the apparatus itself was not part of the article‚Äôs purpose, but I think there are plenty of such on the Internet. <br>  * In the process of writing the topic, no postman was hurt. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/49825/">https://habr.com/ru/post/49825/</a></p>
