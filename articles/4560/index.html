  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The secret service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs - on cybercrime and fight against them</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Last year, about 15 thousand crimes in the field of information technology were recorded.  In the first half of 2006, their number reached 8,400. technical activities.  BSTM is the most secret division of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia, yesterday it celebrated 14 years since its foundation. <br><br>  According to Machabeli, two thirds of the crimes committed today are aimed at stealing information and illegal access to it.  The objects of encroachment, the size of the damage caused and, consequently, the consequences of cybercrime, have changed.  ‚ÄúImagine what a hacker attack on objects of the so-called critical infrastructure can lead to, for example,‚Äù the head of the BSTM illustrates the situation. <br><br>  Often there are all sorts of computer frauds.  The most popular among them are false offers of goods and services via the Internet, as well as frauds with accounts in payment systems and electronic cards.  Scammers find 43% of their victims among the participants of online auctions - they are relatively easy to ‚Äúpeck‚Äù at the offer to buy something at a very low price, but with prepayment.  Others were unlucky in finding marital happiness: up to 10% of the victims are single men from developed countries, caught up in a ruse with the so-called ‚Äúblack brides‚Äù.  Among other growing on the Internet, Evil Machabeli called fictitious transactions through online stores that accept payment via <a href="http://www.webmoney.ru/rus/index.shtml">WebMoney Transfer</a> , as well as electronic extortion.

      The scammers themselves (most of them) are both former convicts and those who are still serving time.  The latter act through friends who are at large.  Both have a common feature - a special ability to gain confidence.  However, civil servants also have special skills: ‚ÄúWe have developed an algorithm by which we install intruders.  As the detection rate increases, these crimes will become less profitable and will disappear after some time.  As it once was with the underground telephone nodes. " <br><br>  Speaking in the context of the broader problem of cyber-terrorism, Machabeli noted that the bureau has the technical capabilities to block criminal sites, but the lack of a law regulating the procedure prevents them from realizing them.  He explained that by cyber-terrorism, the service understands the use of the Internet to host information aimed at inciting intolerance and discord, as well as recruiting new supporters.  The fact that 85% of terrorist sites are supported from abroad was particularly noted. <br><br>  So far there is no law, but perhaps it will appear - the Ministry of Internal Affairs has already submitted a number of legislative initiatives to the State Duma‚Äôs safety committee, according to some of which, it is proposed to exclude anonymity in contracts with providers.  ‚ÄúIn addition, in accordance with the law‚Äú On Communications in the Russian Federation ‚Äù, when concluding an agreement, a mandatory clause should be to immediately unilaterally terminate it by the provider on the basis of a reasoned written decision of the law enforcement agencies,‚Äù added the head of the BSTM. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4560/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4560/</a></p>
