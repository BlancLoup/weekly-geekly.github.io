  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet buyers in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It's no secret that over the past few years the purchase of goods and services on the Internet has become part of the everyday life of many Russians.  Buyers increasingly trust online shopping.  Sellers, in turn, need to justify this trust, and for this it is important to answer, it would seem, a simple question: ‚ÄúRussian Internet buyer - who is he?‚Äù.  If in offline trading, methods of studying consumer preferences have long been developed, in the field of e-commerce, everything is somewhat more complicated.  Sellers do not personally contact customers and can only guess what they are guided by when choosing this or that store and what features of behavior in general are inherent to them.  To solve these issues, a constant exchange of information between players on the e-commerce market is necessary, since the study and analysis of statistics from various sources will be useful in drawing up an adequate portrait of the Russian Internet buyer. <br><br>  The international processing company PayU, which recently opened its representative office in Russia, is ready to share the first statistical data on the results of its work. <br><br>  Based on statistics for the winter period, from December 2011 to February 2012 inclusive, online shoppers who purchased goods and services in stores with an integrated PayU payment system, in most cases, calculated for purchases using Yandex.Money - 40% of the total transactions.  Also among Russian buyers is popular payment through bank cards - 29% of transactions.  More detailed information is presented in the diagram below.

    <img src="http://pics.livejournal.com/payu_russia/pic/0000593t" alt="image"><br><br>  In 2011, the popularity of payment using bank cards increased by 30%. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  This led to the fact that online payments by bank cards overtook such a popular payment system as Qiwi wallet in terms of the number of transactions, as can be seen from the chart.  At the same time, transactions carried out by means of bank cards and payments using Yandex.Money, according to PayU statistics, prevail in the structure of online payment methods. <br><br>  The growing popularity of payment for goods and services on the Internet by bank cards is also indicated by the amount of payment for one transaction, or, in other words, the indicator of the ‚Äúaverage check‚Äù of buyers.  This indicator for bank cards is higher than when using any other payment method, as can be seen from the table below. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b59/db5/7ea/b59db57eaa0668ea0cf7e470fd220d16.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Such a difference can be explained by the fact that more and more Russians pay their wages to a card account in a bank, plastic cards are used when individuals conclude credit and other contracts with banks, as a result, more money is accumulated on a card account than, for example, in the ‚Äúvirtual wallet‚Äù.  Accordingly, more expensive goods are paid by bank cards. <br><br>  So, after analyzing the comparative data on the distribution of transactions between payment methods, we answered the question: ‚ÄúHow does the Russian Internet buyer prefer to pay?‚Äù.  Below we propose to understand when he does it.  The following chart shows the average amount of payments for one month by day. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a84/27c/6e6/a8427c6e6e1e1ac8973d6e8238e6a4ec.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The relatively larger number of payments at the beginning of the month is explained by the frequency of wage payments, as well as by the peculiarities of planning expenses by consumers. <br><br>  In order to get a more detailed answer to the question ‚ÄúWhen?‚Äù, We suggest considering the average hourly activity of buyers per day.  It would seem, how can the analysis of such a small time period be useful when planning your business?  However, in the field of online trading, the data in the table below may be useful to sellers.  Thanks to them, for example, it is possible to more effectively plan activities to promote your online store or to carry out technical work on the site with the least loss. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae7/3bf/f78/ae73bff78cac4f83caa95e871e3d8e94.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After examining a chart reflecting the activity of Internet buyers for a day, a logical conclusion suggests itself that technical work on the site should be carried out from three to six in the morning.  Also, for example, if you have online consultants in the store, you can most effectively arrange their work schedule. <br><br>  Thus, the study and analysis of statistics allows to draw conclusions, on the basis of which it is possible to identify and predict not only the trends of the market as a whole, but also to carry out activities related to a particular online store.  Moreover, such work is useful in developing the functionality of the site.  In particular, familiarization with the data provided by PayU company may encourage store owners to once again pay attention to how payment acceptance is organized on their sites, and, subsequently, to make the necessary improvements. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141951/</a></p>
