  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Layout with eyes closed</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The customer gives the task for the layout, and he is always interested in 2 main questions: cost and time.  A beginner coder cannot evaluate the work himself and, as a rule, looks at how much others ask for it.  An experienced typesetter knows his price and estimates the layout based on the time spent. <br>  But how to determine the exact time to develop, because the client wants to know him before he chooses the artist.  What determines the layout time? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. Professional experience of the maker-up. </h2><br>  Definitely it can be said that an experienced typesetter will typeset faster, because  he has already done many elements of the layout more than once and he only needs time to type the code.  But here you can save time, if instead of writing code from scratch to use the framework of functional blocks. <br><br>  It should be noted that in terms of layout time it is very difficult to say something about the professional level of the layout designer.  This indicator must be taken in conjunction with the quality indicator of the code, its semantics.  By the way, I noticed one interesting point - the semantic layout takes less time.  This is explained by the fact that it has more meaning and less code.

    <h2>  2. ‚ÄúTransparency‚Äù layout </h2><br>  There are such layouts that after one glance at it you do not have questions and you can immediately proceed to the layout.  Do not be lazy and agree on it in more detail!  Very often, the customer forgets that "this is not the final version of the design" or "the menu should be drop-down, it is not drawn on the layout, but it should be done in the style of the site." <br>  If there is a TK, read it very carefully and clarify all doubts about the functioning of the elements. <br>  It is most convenient for me to compile TZ in a dialogue with a customer asking questions that interest me.  A customer often writes a lot of ‚Äúwater‚Äù in his TK, which, as a coder, I don‚Äôt need or seems obvious.  For example: ‚ÄúThe block on the left must drag down when the text is enlarged ...‚Äù Over the same questions that I ask him, he sometimes thinks for a long time, because  when developing his mega-design, he did not foresee that ‚Äúthe horizontal menu will not fit into one line at a resolution of 800px in width, although his design on 1024px is OK‚Äù. <br>  Do not save time at this stage, it should be taken very seriously!  Revision of the layout and its correction does not bring much joy, especially when you have a new super-order with a large budget. <br><br><h2>  3. Experiments </h2><br>  An inexperienced typewriter assesses the layout layout time in days, experienced - in hours.  This happens because in the layout you need to experiment a lot.  As long as you do not write the code with your pens and make sure that it works correctly in all browsers, it is difficult to make clear time forecasts. <br>  If you have not done any elements in practice, but you know that in theory they are precisely made, then it is better to take time to develop them with a margin. <br>  If there are any elements in the layout that you have never encountered either in practice or in theory, then you need to think carefully before agreeing to such an order.  Cause of not fulfilling an order on time, it‚Äôs still half the trouble, and refusing to develop it after agreeing to it will immediately bring you a bad feedback from the customer and spoil the reputation.  Although, on the other hand, you can still devote some time to development and risk taking up such an order with full responsibility for its implementation.  It has been verified on itself that a lot of useful information and new techniques will be learned when time is running out and work is being done at an accelerated pace. <br><br><h2>  4. Forces major and worldly temptations </h2><br>  Of course, no one is immune from the fact that you hurt your hand, or you will break through the water supply.  All these force majeure circumstances will slow down development.  You can "throw" time on the temptations of life.  We saw on TV that Zenit is leading with a 2: 0 score in Bavaria - how can you resist such a thing, or the girl came to visit and today you met the year before, and you completely forgot :) <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  If you are a typewriter with great experience, if you know how to ‚Äúscan‚Äù layouts with your professional look and ask the right questions to the customer, if you would like to experiment, and not with anything, take your calling seriously and customers will appreciate you :) <br><br><h2>  What our life - games. </h2>  Attention, question!  What else depends on the layout time? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25299/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25299/</a></p>
