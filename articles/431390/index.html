Keeping abreast of the transformations taking place in the field of digital marketing is both difficult and interesting.  Everything related to technology and digital changes extremely rapidly, but these changes open up new opportunities to reach the consumer and find their client. <br><br>  In this review, we will look at digital trends that will affect marketing and user behavior in 2019. <br><br> <code><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/la/oi/rv/laoirvdnm_duhwrhamgayjscbdi.png"></code> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Reducing the popularity of social networks </h3><br>  It is difficult to imagine the Internet without social networks.  Their popularity is due to the fact that from sites for communication with friends and relatives they have grown into providers of entertainment content and resources with offers of goods and services.  We learn, we buy, we give recommendations, we correspond with those who are interested in us, we make our publications and we read other people - and all with the help of social networks.  The wide functionality and capabilities of social networks have attracted billions of users.  But now, it seems, people are getting tired of the endless stream of content and the number of functions.

      According to a WebIndex survey, over the past year, 46% of users in the United States and 41% of users in the UK deliberately reduced the time spent on social networks.  What is even more interesting - intentionally, representatives of the Z generation and millennials refuse social networks more often than other demographic groups. <br><br> <code><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/za/a5/sz/zaa5szcmsafncw4ussb5mjqbfqa.png"></code> <br><br>  32% of users in the US and the UK admitted that they purposefully deleted their social network accounts. <br><br> <code><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/w1/iw/td/w1iwtdpsfaws0qkml-afm7uwgqq.png"></code> <br><br>  Of course, these trends are not talking about the imminent end of social networks.  We are only seeing a change in user behavior, both in terms of content consumption and in terms of communication with brands. <br><br>  <i><b>Rookee service expert comment:</b> Since its inception, social networks have quickly gained popularity due to the fact that they allowed anyone to get in touch with a large audience.</i>  <i>For example, a pretty blogger girl, taking a selfie and posting it on Instagram can almost instantly get thousands of views, hundreds of likes and dozens of admiring comments.</i>  <i>But, as is often the case, users have already played enough.</i>  <i>Such publicity no longer causes past enthusiasm.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In addition, from the social networks are now falling upon us the whole flow of new information, not always positive and reliable, the value of which people are beginning to question.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Under these conditions, brands need to think about how to stay ‚Äúin touch‚Äù with their audience.</i>  <i>This will help competent community management strategy based on a deep understanding of the needs of people, as well as high-quality content, evoking vivid emotions and giving real benefits.</i> <br><br><h3>  The combination of artificial intelligence and human creativity </h3><br>  The use of artificial intelligence can significantly increase the effectiveness of campaigns and achieve goals faster. <br><br> <code><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fo/ko/be/fokobekibgzo71eltm3wthgg-fw.jpeg"></code> <br><br>  But artificial intelligence also has its weaknesses.  Therefore, the next stage of development, which we will observe in 2019, is a combination of machine learning technologies with the experience and knowledge of the best specialists of the company.  Machines do an excellent job with routine and analytical tasks that require time-consuming, to seek out patterns.  People can focus on creative tasks and ideas, developing strategies, testing, and developing the company. <br><br>  <i><b>Rookee service expert comment:</b> Digital companies have picked up this trend and are actively using artificial intelligence to solve user problems.</i>  <i>Technologies based on machine learning made it possible to create new quality offers.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Thus, the introduction of machine learning and neural networks in the Rookee service allowed us to create two effective tools for promoting websites:</i> <br><br><ul><li>  <i><a href="https://www.rookee.ru/landing/context%3Fcode%3Dreferral_habr.com_statya_digital_2019_29_11_2018%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_campaign%3Dstatya%26utm_term%3Ddigital_2019%26utm_content%3D29_11_2018">Autopilot contextual advertising</a> .</i>  <i>Automation service contextual advertising, which is based on the technology of self-learning artificial intelligence.</i>  <i>The system takes into account the data accumulated in the entire history of the advertising campaign, and allows you to significantly improve their effectiveness.</i> </li></ul> <i><br></i> <ul><li>  <i><a href="https://www.rookee.ru/about/birzha-ssylok%3Fcode%3Dreferral_habr.com_statya_digital_2019_29_11_2018%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_source%3Dhabr.com%26utm_campaign%3Dstatya%26utm_term%3Ddigital_2019%26utm_content%3D29_11_2018">SMART links</a> .</i>  <i>Technology of promotion to the top of search networks, which works according to the scenario similar to the Yandex ‚ÄúKorolev‚Äù algorithm.</i>  <i>The algorithm makes sense pairs of promoted pages and pages of donor sites and places smart-links to those of them, the text of which, in the sense of, most closely matches the one promoted.</i>  <i>For example, the promoted page is a catalog of cat food.</i>  <i>The service will find on a set of sites about pets the page about cat nutrition and place a link there.</i> </li></ul><br><br><h3>  New Custom Advertising Formats </h3><br>  Users are tired of advertising.  Excessive number of different ads, often irrelevant and uninteresting to those who see them, led to an increase in the popularity of services that allow to block ads.  In order to regain user confidence and increase marketing effectiveness, new personalization ad formats are needed based on personalization.  Their appearance should be expected in 2019. <br><br>  <i><b>Rookee service expert comment:</b> In this vein, they are talking a lot about the Data Management Platform and other technologies that collect customer data using wi-fi, video analytics (for example, online data collection services embedded in a digital screen or a media player in the store) and loyalty programs, and then combine them into target groups with the same needs and interests.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>For example, the technology that allows users to track users and offer them suitable advertising is used by Maxima Telecom.</i> <br><br> <code><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0z/uf/rq/0zufrqnpajnpslzgrl3oselrkhm.png"></code> <br>  <i>Slide from Mashima Telecom Presentation</i> <br><br>  <i>Once in the advertiser's database, the user‚Äôs profile begins to acquire information: it saves all movements, data about the field, age, income level, and interests (based on the websites visited via Wi-Fi).</i> <br><br> <code><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xy/uk/hh/xyukhhf6e6wqzrlndntva3-ups8.png"></code> <br>  <i>Slide from Mashima Telecom Presentation</i> <br><br>  <i>Currently, platforms of this type are only being tested in Russia, but in 2019 we should expect their wider application.</i>  <i>This will allow you to make personalized offers and discounts based on the personal preferences of customers even more accurate and relevant.</i> <br><br><h3>  Confidentiality guarantees are the key to success for brands. </h3><br>  About privacy speak not the first year.  Any leakage of user data leads to reduced trust for companies.  People are increasingly worried about how brands use their personal information. <br><br>  High-quality, user-friendly advertising requires the use of data, such as location, access to contacts and camera.  The question is whether consumers are ready to share their data? <br><br>  If brands want to succeed in new realities, they should focus their efforts on building trust with customers and ensure transparency in the use of personal data.  Consumers need to understand what data they share and why. <br><br>  According to a survey conducted by WebIndex, users are ready to share personal information with online companies, if <br>  - trust them (53%); <br>  - have the ability to access and delete data at any time (46%). <br><br> <code><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zi/vq/bh/zivqbhqy-pzrco2cpvbvisn0wvi.png"></code> <br><br>  The breakdown by demographic groups showed that a young audience (from 16 to 34 years old) often considers their personal information as an asset for which you can get something from the company in return, for example, full access to content or services. <br><br>  It is believed that by sharing data, users receive relevant promotional ads as a promotion.  In fact, this motive - personalized marketing in exchange for personal data - is least appreciated by users of all age groups.  If brands want to use sensitive data for marketing, they need to think about ensuring their safety and how to reward those users who have provided the company with personal information. <br><br><h3>  The growth of voice assistants </h3><br>  Voice assistants have entered our lives and are rapidly gaining momentum.  Almost half of online users over 18 use voice technology anyway. <br><br> <code><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kc/ri/hq/kcrihqjmeuexfv18ydmgrvvr3ws.png"></code> <br><br>  Changing user preferences will gradually shift from the usual search to the side of the search through voice assistants.  All of this can have huge implications for brands. <br><br>  Voice prompts are more personal, similar to dialogue.  Under these conditions, companies should reconsider their approaches to promotion. <br><br>  <i><b>Rookee service expert comment:</b> We live in the era of the ‚Äúvoice revolution‚Äù.</i>  <i>According to Yandex alone, 20% of all requests on mobile devices are voice.</i>  <i>Moreover, already in 2020, according to Comscore's forecast, 50% of all requests will be voice.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>All this changes the user behavior, including in the search.</i>  <i>Companies should now think about optimizing the site for voice search - Voice Search SEO.</i>  <i>Here are some tips:</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <i>create responsive websites;</i> </li></ul><ul><li>  <i>Do not be afraid of incredibly long key phrases (voice requests are common human speech, and it is much longer than written phrases);</i> </li></ul><ul><li>  <i>optimize content for voice search (create FAQ pages on the site);</i> </li></ul><ul><li>  <i>use "Chats for business."</i>  <i>Using Yandex.Dialogov, you can set up chat with users directly on the search results page, as well as through a conversation with Alice.</i> </li></ul><br><br> <code><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qv/-h/gx/qv-hgx6sxn9uzk5uabehjyu2rac.png"></code> <br><br><h3>  Monetization of voice assistants </h3><br>  The proliferation of voice technologies invariably raises the question of their monetization.  There is reason to believe that in the very near future, namely next year, voice assistants will begin to offer advertising or recommendations of goods and services. <br><br>  But will consumers be susceptible to the commercial offers of voice assistants?  The use of ad blocking services around the world suggests that consumers feel overloaded with ads.  Therefore, one of the main tasks in the monetization of voice assistants, the proposal of advertising that will not look redundant, intrusive or unreliable. <br><br><h3>  5G technology deployment </h3><br>  The whole 2018 year conducted testing technology 5G.  According to experts, in 2019 5G standard is expected to be deployed worldwide.  Thanks to this, users will get ultra-wideband Internet access, there will be a mass connection of Internet of Things devices.  This will significantly expand opportunities for innovation in various areas: it will push the development of ‚Äúsmart‚Äù cities, unmanned vehicles, technologies of augmented and virtual reality. <br><br>  For marketing, 5G deployment means the emergence of new ways to interact with the consumer.  Thanks to the Internet of Things, companies will have the opportunity to learn more about the daily lives of customers.  But the development of new technologies will lead to a high level of consumer expectations. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  2019 will give us a new experience in dealing with customers.  To stay one step ahead of competitors and increase the number of conversions, you will need to focus on personalization and take full advantage of new technologies, the growth of which we are already seeing. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431390/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431390/</a></p>
