Reports, as it turned out, are quite good, quite detailed.  First, you can see the statistics for each application and for each version of the application.  In principle, the download information is all public, the price of the application is known, so I see no reason to overwrite the numbers and post the screens as they are. <br> <a href=""><img title="PDFMyWeb Sales Report" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/887/f32/f40/887f32f4082dbee505df305189b2b4ba.png" width="573" height="124"></a> <br>  There are also more detailed reports that indicate in which state how many purchases were made in a month.  I suspect that after paid applications become available to those who wish in other countries, there will also be a separate line for each country in the reports. <br> <a href=""><img title="PDFMyWeb for WebOS Sales Statistics" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df9/149/78f/df914978ff588eafdd6cb2cceb4c868d.png" width="570" height="171"></a> <br>  Everything seems to be normal, the application was sold, positive feedback was received, everyone was happy and happy, even the review wrote a wonderful thing in Pre Central.  All this lasted until I decided to update the application, adding new functionality. <br>  As usual, I posted a new binary, gave it to the review.  Three days passed and ... here it is!  More than a thousand downloads in the first day after publication!  I am even glad straight.

    <h3>  Epic fail </h3><br>  I have a habit, I occasionally search for information about my applications in Google.  Just for fun, find out what people are writing. <br>  After waiting a day after publication, I decided to see what people were writing about my wonderful creation.  And, as it turned out, they write strange.  The phrase that ‚ÄúCool that in this version they reduced the price to $ 0‚Äù seemed to me the strangest.  In general, more than a thousand downloads per day also seemed strange to me, considering that in the middle of February only 388 copies of the application were purchased.  I went to check in the admin panel.  And yet, yes, dear comrades from Palm have posted a new version of my application with a price of $ 0 instead of those stated at $ 0.99. <br>  In this place, I <s>had to dirty curse</s> was not on its own, but, as experience shows, in such cases it is better not to freak out, but just systematically solve the problem.  I wrote to Palm support that I had a problem with the latest version of the application.  I paid $ 50 for the submit, the previous version of the application was paid, but for some reason it became free.  Can you roll back all downloads of the current version and make my application paid again?  I also described the sequence of actions for submitting an application from the very beginning.  I told that the first version was a free beta, then I submitted the paid application, then I updated the version, after which a bjaka occurred. <br>  In fact, when communicating with a support, I did not count on the result.  Rather, even not so much, judging by the past communication, I waited for the answer in a week and a half, when everyone who needs it will already download the free version and there will be no point in selling the application at all.  But this time everything was fast.  The first answer came after 4 hours asking if my application was really paid.  I replied that yes, and they can see the sales reports for February.  The next letter was a notification that my application was removed from the directory (suspended) until the source of the problems was clarified and until they could make the application paid again. <br>  Up to that moment, as the application got stuck, about 2900 lemmings had time to download it, but as a whole I was satisfied with the support this time, they decided everything during the day. <br>  After another day, I was told that the kin would not be and you could not add the application again as paid, you just have to submit the application with a new package ID and pay $ 50. <br>  In this place, I again had to <s>dirty swear</s> to think.  But what about my money that I spent on submitting this application?  After all, it was not my fault, but because of a bug in their system.  I quite delicately hinted to support about my thoughts on this topic. <br>  And lo and behold!  They promised to try to consider the possibility of returning money to me for the last submit.  So they wrote - try to think about the possibilities. <br>  Knowing how everything is done with us, I didn‚Äôt count on the result, because Papuan is a Papuan friend, comrade and ... feed.  So I just prepared a new version of the application, adding the word Pro at the end to it, as well as inserting several useful features for setting up downloadable PDF files, and ... gave another $ 50 for a new submit;) <br>  And, yes, another + $ 20 gave the freelance designer for transferring the icon to a vector and for blinding me the ICO file (looking at all this, I also decided to do versions for other mobile platforms). <br><br><h3>  Well, at least something good </h3><br>  Another day (while there was a review of the new application), I received good news from Palm that, yes, they took pity on me and returned $ 50.  And nobody tried to roll back free downloads of the old application.  In total, it turns out that because of a bug in the Palm system in the world, there are 3,000 happy lemmings more.  Well, okay, we will consider that a good deed will be reckoned to me and I will get + 10 ppyak. <br>  And now it is today.  And today I got two good news at once. <br>  The first - came the documents confirming the validity of the EIN, which I searched in Google Checkout and Palm App Catalog. <br>  The second is that my application <a title="PDFMyWeb Pro" href="http://developer.palm.com/appredirect/%3Fpackageid%3Dcom.it-dimension.pdfmywebpro">has been reviewed and is available for download</a> . <br>  Now again, just have to wait.  Let's see how users who have bought the previous paid version of the application will react to the fact that it is no longer in the catalog, they will not receive updates, but there is another application with almost the same functionality, with the same name, from the same developer, but more expensive . <br>  Finally the video <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wiTA6mb-yhw&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhghkU9UAM9UQzIuUn0Vy77UGtldhw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <a title="PDFMyWeb Pro - Pre Central" href="http://www.precentral.net/app-gallery/app-catalog/pdfmyweb-pro">And another link to Pre Central</a> , where you can vote for the application and see the statistics. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87946/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87946/</a></p>
