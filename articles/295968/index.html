  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Foreign IT companies may leave the Russian Federation: read the news on the memo by Galina Timchenko</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On the morning of November 2, Kommersant <a href="http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2845568">announced</a> that foreign IT companies could leave the Russian market.  <a href="http://ichar.ru/">iChar</a> reads the news on the instructions of the ex-chief editor of "Tapes.ru" Galina Timchenko, in order to understand what this publication is really about. <br><br>  We will analyze the news "Kommersant" on all eight points of the <a href="http://airpersonalities.ru/PDF/Kak_chitat_novosti.pdf">memo</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/6b2/45a/10c/6b245a10cfca229f2969f6bce540a27b.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. "Do not believe the headlines ... </h2><br>  <b>... They are written to attract attention and usually do not carry a serious semantic load.</b>  <b>Often the title is contrary to the content. "</b> 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      So, the title: “Soft has shown firmness.  Foreign IT companies are threatening to leave Russia. ” <br><br>  Note: "Kommersant" does not say that foreign IT-companies are already leaving or is about to leave.  They only threaten to leave and "show firmness."  That is, in fact, nothing has happened yet and there is only one talk on this topic. <br><br><h2>  2. “Check the verbs in the heading and the first paragraph, it is there that contains significant information ... </h2><br>  <b>... If the title reads “Foreign wine is banned in Russia”, then you will surely learn from the first paragraph that only an official has come up with such an initiative. ”</b> <br><br>  Check the first paragraph: <br><br>  <i>“The largest foreign IT-companies <b>can curtail</b> their investment programs and leave the Russian market altogether ... A government decree that <b>allows the</b> purchase of their software for government purposes only in the absence of a domestic counterpart can <b>complicate the situation of</b> foreign IT-companies.”</i> <br><br>  The Kommersant note only deals with the possibility of curbing investment programs by foreign IT companies and their likely withdrawal from the market.  In other words, they may wind up investment programs, but they may not wind down, or they may even spend the New Year corporate party in Zimbabwe or transfer the head office to Antarctica.  Anything can happen, but this is not news as long as there are no facts. <br><br><h2>  3. “If the title and content of the news do not match, look at the third or fourth paragraph ... </h2><br>  <b>... It is there that the “main character” appears (the one for whom it was written, or the “customer”).</b>  <b>His opinion is likely to be issued by direct speech. "</b> <br><br>  Taking advantage of the advice of Galina Timchenko, we direct our view to the following paragraphs.  Already in the second, the director general of the Association of European Businesses (AEB) Frank Schauff appears.  He asks to postpone for six months the entry into force of the law, which allows government agencies to buy foreign software only if they do not have a domestic counterpart.  In the third paragraph, we see a quote by Frank Schauff, issued in direct speech: <br><br>  <i>“Mr. Schauff notes that“ European business in the past decade has made significant investments in the Russian Federation and planned to invest in the future, ”but now foreign IT companies may suspend investment programs and even withdraw from the Russian market under the conditions of unclear rules of the game.</i>  <i>“If foreign investment is still on the agenda, then equal treatment and non-discrimination and restriction of free competition and access to the Russian market for foreign companies are needed,” writes Frank Schauff.</i> <br><br>  The rule works.  We really find in the news the main character, who poses the problem of free competition in the Russian IT market. <br><br><h2>  4. "Pay attention to the source ... </h2><br>  <b>... If there is no link to the source at all in the news note - this is a reason to doubt the accuracy of the information.</b>  <b>If the publication refers in the note to the information of another newspaper or news resource - do not be lazy, follow the link and compare. ”</b> <br>  In our case, the sources of information are <i>“the letter of the AEB to the Minister of Communications and Mass Communications Nikolai Nikiforov, the Minister of Industry and Trade Denis Manturov, the Minister of Economic Development Alexei Ulyukayev and the head of FAS Igor Artemiev</i> . <i>”</i> <br><br>  We read further and we see that <i>“The AEB declined to comment,”</i> and <i>“The Ministry of Economics" Kommersant "reported that the AEB appeal has not yet received</i> . <i>"</i> <br><br><h2>  5. “If the newspaper confidently reports about the event, but all the participants interviewed do not comment on it or deny it, this is a reason to suspect the publication in the publication of“ plum ”- unverified information, rumors that are thrown in for a specific purpose. </h2><br>  As we have already discussed above, the AEB declined to comment, and the Ministry of Economics did not confirm receipt of the letter.  We in no way believe that this news is the very “drain”: two experts comment on the event at once. <br><br><h2>  6. “News is an event that has already happened ... </h2><br>  <b>... If a news note begins with a loud statement about the inevitability of a certain event in the future (environmental catastrophe, epidemic, etc.), this means that this is not news, but a horror story. ”</b> <br><br>  After reading the news completely, we can conclude that the event itself has not yet happened.  It can happen if an appropriate law is adopted - but it has not been adopted yet.  "Scary"? <br><br><h2>  7. "About experts ... </h2><br>  <b>... Before you listen to their opinion, you should type the name of an expert in any search engine and check whether it is related to the problems described in the news article. "</b> <br><br>  Checked.  Both experts who commented to Kommersant are directly related to the topic.  This is a representative of the Ministry of Economics Elena Lashkina and executive director of the Association of software developers "Otechestvenniy Soft" Evgenia Vasilenko. <br><br><h2>  8. "The news always has the details ... </h2><br>  <b>... They are few, but they are always there: the address, the time of the event, the participants, the circumstances of the case.</b>  <b>But emotions should not be.</b>  <b>The epithet is an alarm for the reader, his appearance indicates a lack of texture. "</b> <br><br>  “Kommersant” can never be reproached with, it is in the emotionality and abundance of inappropriate epithets.  The publication is working on the topic, not giving it ratings and interpretations. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  The main news of the day in IT: nothing happened.  Foreign IT companies may leave the Russian market (or they may not) due to the fact that a law may be adopted (which has not yet been adopted). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295968/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295968/</a></p>
