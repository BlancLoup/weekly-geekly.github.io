No software </h5><br>  Download on the phone except for games - absolutely nothing.  And we are not talking about idle trips to the <s>marketplace</s> in search of something like this (and this pattern of behavior takes place in the eppstore and google).  There are not even basic programs: there is no dropbox, there is no YouTube (there is no Google at all, and there will not be, but there is a separate item on this account). <br><br>  And after all, the WP ecosystem is not the first month, or even the first year.  When I bought a windscreen, I assumed that there was no exotic thing, but I did not doubt the availability of the largest services.  As it turned out, nothing.  Therefore: <br><blockquote>  Before entering the chilo of windows drivers - check if you have the software you need!  The time when you could reassure yourself ‚Äúis about to be released‚Äù is long gone. </blockquote>

      I understand that the marketplace has self-written applications from enthusiasts, and it is possible to work with services from the browser.  But this is a sad consequence of the lack of original applications, and not a happy alternative. <br><br><h5>  2. The one that is (software, we are talking about it) is mostly terrible </h5><br>  Braking, long inadequate, with repeated notifications on Facebook - shocked me.  What is surprising, developers post updates regularly - once a week at least.  But they do not correct the situation - notifications fall without any connection with reality, the content update takes a damn long time, and the interface at 6 inches looks bad. <br><br>  Skype  It would seem that it should be beautiful on Windows.  But no, he is worse than his colleagues on Apple and Google: uncomfortable, thoughtful, containing the absolute minimum information. <br><br>  AlfaBank - the number of functions with android and iOS does not go to any comparison. <br><br>  The list could be continued for a long time, but as you remember in the marketplace there are not enough programs for this.  To sum up the impressions of the marketplace, then: <br><ul><li>  There is probably no necessary service. </li><li>  If it is, then the functionality is much worse than the counterparts from other platforms </li></ul><br><br><h5>  3. No big screen optimization. </h5><br>  I'll just leave it here. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ae/a86/d4b/3aea86d4b91c12f30cb7624e07c07f54.png"><br>  It is about 6 inch spade.  Almost like galaxy 7. <br><br><h5>  4. Maps </h5><br>  On the Internet, it is customary to praise the built-in Nokiev cards.  I honestly did not understand what was so good about them, but I realized what was bad about them: <br><blockquote>  They allow you to download maps of the desired terrain to the device, and MS considers this a competitive advantage.  Therefore, other cartographic services of this opportunity are automatically deprived. </blockquote><br>  <b>Those.</b>  <b>in Yandex.Maps, 2Gis and other programs to download maps to the device is IMPOSSIBLE.</b>  <b>Use Noklakartami.</b> <br><br><h5>  5. There is no navigation through the installed programs. </h5><br>  In general, the working interface of a mobile Windows consists of 2 screens: <br><ol><li>  Tiles are the main and only desktop on which application tiles can be displayed.  And I liked this solution - not ideal, but you can get used to it and make it convenient. </li><li>  List of applications.  That is literally a list of applications.  Icon and title.  And this is a list.  A long list.  No folders, no sorting, no hidden partitions.  Just a long sheet with icons and titles.  Navigating only by alphabet or search. </li></ol><br><br><h5>  6. No navigation in settings </h5><br>  When you go into the settings, you understand that everything in the list of applications was excellent.  There were icons.  Settings in Windows are a huge sheet of words.  Everything.  It is better to see once: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71b/68e/d72/71b68ed7263c18ea6d85668c9873d1ef.png"><br><br><h5>  7. No GMAIL sync </h5><br>  If you use Google mail or mail on a domain under Google, you can forget about push mail delivery.  What is interesting is that in the Internet they write that for mail for a domain this is possible using the settings through the exchange protocol (as it was always done on the iPhone).  But does not work.  It's sad, depressing - but there is no push delivery letter with gmail on the Windows Phone. <br><br><h5>  8. There are no google services at all.  And not expected GS </h5><br>  But it was a surprise for me, as they say - not in the eyebrow, but in the eye.  Maybe all this has always been known, but I could not have imagined that there was no windscreen: <br><ul><li>  Gmail </li><li>  Youtube </li><li>  Gdrive </li><li>  Chrome </li><li>  Maps </li><li>  etc </li></ul><br>  and that the worst thing is not expected <br>  I‚Äôm worried about the fact that there is no Google services on the device, and it‚Äôs deep to me who cares: MS or Google <br><br><h5>  9. Idiotic logic of running processes and management </h5><br>  On Windows there is a hardware (touch) button "back".  What happens when you press it you never know for sure.  Sometimes you get to the previous application, sometimes you go one level higher in the current app, sometimes you get to the desktop.  Surprise on surprise.  Moreover, sometimes this button closes the application, and sometimes not. <br><br>  And with a long tap on this magic button, Windows will kindly show a list of running applications.  But some kind of strange, I have never had more than 4-5 applications there.  And Internet tabs are displayed as separate running processes.  Why is this done and why is an unknown mystery. <br><br>  As a result, the user has no understanding of what programs are running, and therefore the ability to influence it. <br><br><h5>  9. Brake chamber </h5><br>  The camera in the device is decent, like in the iPhone 4 / 4S.  But the launch is indecently long. <br>  <i>And how to take photos from WhatsApp I did not understand at all.</i>  <i>When tapping on the screen, nothing happens, as when you press the hardware button of the camera</i> <br><br><h5>  10. Bardak with the file system </h5><br>  For some reason, my photos are stored in 8 different folders.  For example, Facebook has created several folders (a la albums) and uploaded all the pictures and images that have ever been uploaded by my FB-acc.  What for?  It can not be disabled. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/134/b94/9b6/134b949b6903b9b6b31f33506c8f47e1.png"><br>  Synchronization skydrayv, by the way, also defies customization.  And often does not work. <br><br><h5>  11. Work with hotmail account only. </h5><br>  When I first started, Windows asked me for a Live ID account and happily consumed my home MS account on gmail's mail.  But the happiness was not long, when trying to download something from the store, they demanded that I log in again.  And here came a surprise - it turns out that the windshield does not allow working with the marketplace with a mail-based account different from hotmail. <br><br>  And the second surprise was that it was no longer possible to re-register from another account.  By this time, the device has already been configured - and the only way out is a complete reset of the shovel. <br><br>  But I struggled, I went (from the computer) to the settings of the Live ID account and created an alternative name for my ID using Hotmail.  Then I tried authorization again.  Nifiga <br><br>  As a result, if you want to use the Live ID account, which is sent to a mail other than hotmail, follow the following instructions: <br><ol><li>  Go to the Live ID settings from your computer </li><li>  Associate with your hotmail account mail </li><li>  And only after that start the first launch of the device. </li></ol><br>  It works only in this order.  3,1,2,3 - does not work, you have to do a full reset. <br><br><h5>  12. Sound adjustment </h5><br>  Well, everything is simple.  In Windows, everything is simple - and only 1 sound adjustment.  If you made music or play more quietly, then the call will play with the same volume.  <i>It is said that the main innovation of the mythical 8.1 is precisely the separate volume control.</i> <br><br><h5>  13. No command center </h5><br>  Those.  turn off the network, adjust the brightness and other basic settings are made only through a sheet of settings <br><br><h5>  14. Donkey </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/174/a1c/1f8/174a1c1f8a4c85dd4db89b876d0f1a93.png"><br>  Pre-installed internet explorer sad: <br><ul><li>  The lack of full-screen mode (on 6 inches the search string takes DOFIG space) </li><li>  Only 6 tabs.  Which will close when you open a new one - a surprise! </li><li> Can not store passwords (can not found) </li><li>  Can't clean cookies (maybe not found) </li></ul><br>  And there are no alternatives ... <br>  <i>They say that in addition to the separate volume control in 8.1 there will be more tabs!</i> <br><br><h5>  15. Mail </h5><br>  In two screenshots fit all the functionality and interface: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c69/daf/cbc/c69dafcbc7ca364aee36e7b523fbdf63.png"><br>  And there are no alternatives ... <br><br><h5>  16. Fig sell </h5><br>  I understand that my post will not contribute to this.  But yes) <br><br><h5>  pros </h5><br>  I also had occasional problems with the screen and the falling off sound, but I just had no luck with it.  Although the apparatus as a whole has its advantages, moreover, powerful advantages: <br><ol><li>  Excellent body in terms of materials and sensations from them.  Well, super! </li><li>  Excellent screen, which is almost impossible to evaluate in the system. </li><li>  Mode of operation in the sun.  Really helps </li><li>  Mega battery.  IPhone nervously smokes on the sidelines.  Keeps well and stably </li><li>  Mega sim module.  Communication keeps very confident, 3G holds much better than iPhones of all generations </li><li>  The system is very fast.  No slower than iOS </li><li>  Programs and games are also loaded very quickly.  But inside they have a long weary download content </li><li>  Cool pre-installed Bing services (news, sports - very nice and comfortable) </li><li>  An interesting idea with tiles, the start screen is really convenient.  This is not a brilliant and better solution, but quite worthy. </li></ol><br><h5>  Total my igogo: </h5><br>  Using Windows Phone in its current form is not a pleasure for the faint of heart, and certainly not for those who need a ready-made working tool.  The system is stable, but its very essence, interface and requirements for application developers reduce all advantages to nothing.  As for Nokia, the device turned out to be excellent, be there another axis ... <br><br>  PS It is very likely that the curvature of the hands of the author is the cause of many jambs.  Specify in the comments which ones <br>  PPS Most angry comments come down to the fact that: <br><ul><li>  you can find crutches, stick to them and my problems will cease to be problems </li><li>  8.1 will be released soon, in which all mega functions will be implemented (existing on other platforms since prehistoric times) </li></ul><br>  But no matter how it solves the fact that it is hard for a person to use the device without Vaseline <br><br><h4>  Have a great weekend and thoughtful shopping;) </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/215619/">https://habr.com/ru/post/215619/</a></p>
