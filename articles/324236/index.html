We are talking about changes in the business architecture of the company, that is, in the organizational structure, in business processes and their supporting technologies. <br><br>  <b>On the fifth week of the course</b> , the main provisions of the P2M standard are considered: key definitions and concepts are introduced, the logic of using the standard to form a holistic view of the goals and methods of implementing innovative projects and programs is considered. <br><br>  <b>The sixth week is</b> devoted to the design of the program architecture. <br><br>  The main theme of the <b>seventh, last, week of the course</b> is the innovative environment of the enterprise.
