Part 1: image problems.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Those who resent the duplication of a post on Habr√© from <a href="http://blog.micromarketing.ru/">my blog</a> : although there are many inhabitants of Habr among my subscribers, but the audience does not overlap completely, and this article may be useful to a wide circle of readers.  So do not be indignant;) <br><br>  If he didn‚Äôt come across himself, he wouldn‚Äôt believe that such blunders still allow.  But from my personal experience I can judge: at least half of the events have problems with image and sound.  The reasons lie not so much in the technical plane, as in the organizational.  Many problems can be prevented by a few simple steps.  In this part I will talk about the problems with the image. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Most frequent</b>

      The most common blooper is an idle pair of ‚Äúlaptop-projector‚Äù.  Imagine: a full house, people paid money, made time, and for 30 minutes they were watching desperate attempts to get at least some image on the screen.  The laptop is working, the projector is working, there is no picture on the screen.  Dissatisfied appear in the hall.  Tension is growing.  Nervous boys torment the laptop.  Pale girls tearfully urge one of the speakers to "act like this, without slides."  In the worst case, the event fails. <br><br>  A variety of problems: the image is there, but the proportions are distorted.  This most often happens with widescreen laptops.  Treated setting. <br><br>  The second problem that I also encountered was the lack of necessary programs on the computer, for example, Power Point.  As a result, the speakers can not show their slides, you have to quickly look for a replacement laptop.  More often than not, one of the speakers comes to the rescue, but the trouble is ... After this person has acted himself, he must leave.  Full intermission. <br><br>  A variety of problems: sometimes it happens that there are no codecs, and in the presentation you need to show a video clip.  As a result, no one will see a substantial part of someone‚Äôs report, and this is fraught with scandal. <br><br>  <b>Exotic options</b> <br><br>  Less common is a dim lamp near the projector.  Turn off the lights, dim the windows, everything will be useless.  Need to change the projector. <br><br>  It happens that the image on the screen turns out some unnatural colors.  On the projector, the screen saver and menu is fine.  On a laptop, everything is fine.  But the picture from the laptop is distorted.  The cable broke from frequent bending, and one of the wires was broken. <br><br>  It rarely happens that the lamp has burned out at the projector or the laptop does not work.  In my memory it was once, but I remember for a lifetime. <br><br>  <b>A simple solution.</b>  <b>What does half the organizers not do?</b> <br><br>  The solution to these problems is striking in its simplicity and efficiency.  It is necessary to check in advance the operation of the laptop and the projector.  Run Power Point and make sure the presentation is displayed on the screen and the picture is in order. <br><br>  Most often problems arise when the equipment is provided by the organization from which you rent the hall.  Even if you do not have your own projector, it‚Äôs not so difficult to turn on the equipment an hour before the event starts and make sure that everything is working properly.  Surprisingly, almost half of the organizers do not. <br><br>  Of course, always know how to find the person in charge of the equipment so that if necessary you can replace everything before the event. <br><br>  <b>An ounce of prevention is a pound of cure</b> <br><br>  Problems with software are also solved.  First, determine the technical requirements for the presentations and get them to comply with the speakers. <br><br>  Secondly, you need to get all the files in advance and make sure that they work on the computer from which the image will go to the screen.  Presenters should know: if they do not provide the files before the start of the presentation, then you will not give them any guarantees. <br><br>  Is everything simple?  Yes!  But why almost half of the organizers do not check the equipment? <br><br>  In the next part I will talk about the problems with sound. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/2645/">https://habr.com/ru/post/2645/</a></p>
