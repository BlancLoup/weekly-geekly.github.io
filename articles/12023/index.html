With her, I continue the topic begun by four other notes and connected with the prospect of creating an <em><strong>intelligent social environment</strong></em> .  Each of these two series is dedicated to one of the first two main sections of this note.  The third section appeared at the last moment, but more on that later. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      <strong>What is bad?</strong>  <strong>or who is to blame?</strong> <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Analogy number 1</strong> .  The Bolsheviks never really represented the majority of the population of Russia.  This was a rather small, but very aggressive-minded group of loud-hearted adventurers, who succeeded first in demagogy, and then by force in a cocktail with the same demagogy, subjugating the whole country to themselves.  But on a historical scale, fortunately, not for long ... </blockquote><br><br>  <em>The above thought is not mine.</em>  <em>However, I don‚Äôt remember the source, therefore I cannot vouch for the accuracy of the quotation.</em> <br><br>  The overall result of the discussion ‚ÄúHow I was buried ...‚Äù can be expressed in one phrase: ‚ÄúJupiter, you are angry, it means ... I'm right!‚Äù Although, I repeat, it was just that I saw no jupiter among my embittered opponents.  A herd of little evil men, whom I still want to thank for the opportunity to once again and very clearly illustrate all my earlier concerns about the fate of the social web. <br><br>  Unfortunately, they showed one of my rude (almost Lysenko :)) misconception, expressed in this article, that the environment can change behavior.  I once again convinced that miracles do not happen, and genetics are still right.  The ubiquitous men, registered in news2, got me and in habrahabr. <br><br>  Who and what are they so vehemently defending?  No, not the main nightman news2.  And not even news2 itself.  They defended themselves, their ability to continue to judge the case of any dissent.  The opportunity, instead of discussing the essentially raised problems, is to reduce the conversation to ‚Äúlabeling‚Äù the labels, and at the same time to ‚Äúthrow in‚Äù black balls to the author.  Cool guys.  Indeed, as he said he sings about their ideological predecessors, ‚Äúthere would be no nails for these people, there would not be a world stronger than nails!‚Äù <br><br>  That only you in their comments will not find.  And the recommendation to turn to a psychiatrist, made right there in a review to another of my notes on this topic (simply speaking, ‚Äúfool himself‚Äù :)).  And strong advice to stop promoting your blog in news2 (let the blogger who does not use news social networks for this purpose throw a stone at me).  And allegations of lying.  And the passages about the ‚Äúunrecognized genius‚Äù (I will come back to this question), ‚Äúthe father of Russian democracy‚Äù (what this relation, in general, has to the subject of discussion) and much more.  The ‚Äúconverted forum‚Äù was also remembered, on the basis of which I organized my blog at iTech Bridge (as if the form could affect the content. By the way, another <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D12324">big question</a> is what, when and for what is better to adapt) ... <br><br>  You will not find in the comments sounded only one thing - a refutation of my basic theses that not everything is in order in the kingdom of Web 2.0 and who is to blame.  My opponents thought that the method of discussion chosen by him was more convincing than a conversation on the subject matter.  I do not want to repeat once again what I have repeatedly said in my previous notes on this issue.  It's time to put a full stop.  Once again, I will repeat my general thesis: <br><br>  <em><strong>I am convinced that the childhood illness of extremism on the Internet will pass.</strong></em>  <em><strong>The boisterous foam around Web 2.0 will drop.</strong></em>  <em><strong>This direction is sure to mature, and therefore will wiser.</strong></em>  <em><strong>The silent majority of users still have their say.</strong></em> <br><br>  <em>Other notes of this series:</em> <br>  <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D13003">Open letter to the Main Nightman News2.ru</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D24853">How I was buried in news2.ru</a> <br><br>  <strong>... and what is good?</strong>  <strong>or what to do?</strong> <br><br>  <em>But these are the questions that I raise in the previously launched series of notes about the intelligent social environment.</em>  <em>By the way, this is also the answer to one timidly asked question in the ‚Äúdiscussion‚Äù: ‚ÄúWhat do you suggest?‚Äù.</em> <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Analogy No. 2. The</strong> political system does not affect the distribution of biological and social stereotypes of human behavior among the population.  This distribution is, on the whole, unchanged.  However, the possibility of open manifestation of such stereotypes in society is already directly connected with its political structure.  In other words, these manifestations depend on the legislative basis of society and, in particular, on the severity of the law that prosecutes violators of any state law.  Without laws, as such, the normal existence of society is impossible.  Any "City of the Sun" inevitably turns into a "Animal Farm", living "by concepts." </blockquote><br><br>  And again the thought is not mine, I don‚Äôt remember the source, I don‚Äôt guarantee the accuracy of the quotation, but I completely agree with the text.  Without law, neither real nor virtual society can exist.  Therefore, I do not fight with the carriers of a stereotype of human behavior.  It just does not make sense. <br><br>  <em><strong>I fight for social resources with well-thought-out laws.</strong></em>  <em><strong>Such rules of the game that would stimulate the best and prevent the worst manifestations of human nature from coming to the surface.</strong></em>  <em><strong>At the same time, I argue that without some administration element, arbitrarily good rules for an arbitrarily good resource will not work.</strong></em>  <em><strong>Any democracy is good only up to the limit after which it turns into an ochlocracy.</strong></em> <em><strong><br></strong></em> <br>  It was to discuss what needs to be done to build such a social environment and I decided to organize in habrahabr.ru a collective blog ‚ÄúAnd an <em>intelligent social web</em> ‚Äù in which you are now.  Until well-wishers finally killed my karma :) (for the uninitiated, a collective blog can be started only by a user with a karma of at least 5. After a ‚Äúlively discussion‚Äù around my last note, which took place mostly without the participation of the author, my karma is in a few hours dropped from 11.13 to 7.5, and habrasila from 14.06 to 11.05). <br><br>  The blog focuses on the discussion of the concept and approaches to creating an intelligent environment for intelligent people on the Internet: algorithms and methods for ranking information and users, incentives, the place and role of administration and moderators in the system, business issues - the application of the social environment, etc. <br><br>  I invite to participate in the work of the new blog all those interested in its topics.  The controversy here is foreseen to be very tough, but please, just ... without becoming personal.  Just like in some examples, I tried to show ‚Äúwhat is bad,‚Äù I would like to not only understand, but also demonstrate, by discussions in this blog, and ‚Äúwhat is good.‚Äù  I really hope that the blog will not turn into a ‚Äúone-man show‚Äù, the hero of which fights with the defenders of some of the outgoing (convinced of this) features of Web 2.0.  Fights before the silent majority. <br><br>  <em>Other notes in this series, abbreviated versions of most of which, together with the ones mentioned above, I transferred to a new blog</em> : <br>  <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D8552">News2.ru for business: why would I abstain</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D11436">Why do we need a shovel in News2.ru?</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D16344">My Space, which I cannot find on the Internet</a> (the general formulation of the problem is the refined theme of the new blog) <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D18157">Intelligent social environment: how to make a fairy tale come true?</a> <br><br>  <strong>Society of Unrecognized Geniuses</strong> <br><br>  <em>This section of the note appeared already when the new blog was created, and the main part of this note was ready for publication.</em>  <em>At the last moment I received a letter (this time I quote literally, although the author‚Äôs name is not indicated again for reasons of confidentiality of personal correspondence):</em> <br><br><blockquote>  <strong>Fact number X from virtual life</strong> ( <em>My title</em> is AM).  I decided to write to the blog "Intelligent Social Web", but due to the small size of my karma, Habr does not allow me to do this.  Annoyingly.  It can be seen that it was not worth writing in the comments to one of the posts of someone's blog that after ASP.NET does not pull back to PHP.  However, my opinion from minusovaniya not changed :) </blockquote><br><br>  Many have the impression that all the ‚Äúfuss‚Äù (again, the passage from the comments of my opponents) was started only from the feeling of personal insult of the ‚Äúunrecognized genius‚Äù.  All my explanations that I‚Äôm struggling not with personalities, not with specific resources and ‚Äúnot self-interest for the sake of :), but only‚Äù because of the desire to find cures for childhood illness of extremism in Web 2.0, do not reach many. <br><br>  Well, well, again I can only thank my opponents for the idea and announce the following.  Established <em>Society of Unrecognized Geniuses</em> (ONG).  The society is open to any user of social resources, whose message (subject, comment, link) was rejected or ‚Äúzaminusovano‚Äù, and its rating (reputation, karma, etc.) were downgraded for subjective reasons.  All you need to join ONG is to place in <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowforum%3D811">iTech Bridge a</a> link to your ill-fated message or this message itself.  After checking it out, the corresponding direct link will be posted in habrahabr (for now, in the collective blog that is being presented, and there, if I stay ‚Äúalive‚Äù :), I will get a special collective blog).  In more detail about the conditions of the activity of GNG I will inform in a separate note. <br>  - <em>By the way, I want to make childhood the symbol (avatar) of a new blog - the state of today's social environment.</em>  <em>I am looking for the appropriate photo ...</em> <em><br></em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12023/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12023/</a></p>
