They created a long-term project to develop cloud systems.  Partners plan to combine cognitive systems, cloud services and high-performance IBM servers with enterprise software and the SAP cloud platform.  After that, companies will be able to upgrade their designs. <br><br>  Computing resources will be deployed in the German city of Walldorf, where the SAP headquarters is located, and in Palo Alto, California. <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe have identified mutually complementary functions that can simplify and speed up the delivery of results for our clients,‚Äù <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-sap-to-integrate-complementary-cloud-technologies-1459942856">said</a> Bridget van Kralingen, senior vice president of IBM, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-sap-to-integrate-complementary-cloud-technologies-1459942856">to</a> The Wall Street Journal. <a name="habracut"></a>

      Using cloud technologies, SAP is developing a <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAP_HANA">HANA</a> platform. <br><blockquote>  This is a high-performance NewSQL platform for data storage and processing, which is based on in-memory computing technology using column-wise data storage platform. </blockquote>  In it, the developers used special methods of working with computer memory to speed up operations with databases, with intensive reading and writing to the hard disk. <br><br>  Under the new joint project, partners are planning to deploy scalable SAP HANA Enterprise Cloud services on the IBM cloud platform.  In addition, the partners will engage in the joint development of local services, cognitive technologies and client systems. <br><br>  In October 2014, it was announced that SAP will begin to use IBM's computing resources along with its own to provide the capabilities of its software in the form of Internet services, <a href="http://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2016/04/07/636743-ibm-sap-budut-vmeste-razvivat-oblachnie-servisi">remind</a> Vedomosti. <br><br>  SAP software products are designed to manage business processes, including manufacturing, warehouse and financial operations. <br><br>  IBM has become a notable player in the cloud market after purchasing SoftLayer in 2013.  For 104 years of existence, IBM has repeatedly rebuilt its business.  Now the corporation has yet to do it. <br><br>  It is expected that the partnership of SAP with this high-tech giant will give additional confidence to large corporate clients using their own data processing centers or outsourcing in combination with cloud services. <br><br>  According to IDC estimates, the Russian cloud services market in 2014 grew to $ 336 million, which is 38% more than those earned by cloud service providers in 2013.  The largest providers of cloud services in the Russian market IDC calls Microsoft, Salesforce and IBM.  The demand for cloud services in Russia is growing, as customers seek to save money and not create an IT infrastructure with their own funds. <br><br>  The law obliging state agencies to submit a written argument for the purchase of foreign software from January 1, 2016 does not apply to cloud services that use, for the most part, foreign software. <br><br>  Taking advantage of the fact that the law does not yet apply to the clouds, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft">Microsoft</a> agreed with six IT companies to offer cloud solutions to Russian customers in January.  SAP started providing cloud services to customers in December 2014, and for this purpose opened a data center in Moscow. <br><br>  According to the National Association of Electronic Commerce Participants, SAP in 2014 was the most sought-after software developer in the Russian public sector, who bought 5.6 billion rubles in its solutions.  Next come <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle">Oracle</a> (4.6 billion rubles), IBM (3.3 billion rubles), Microsoft (3.05 billion rubles) and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cisco">Cisco</a> (1.9 billion rubles). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299946/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299946/</a></p>
