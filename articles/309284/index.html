However, even this is not at all the key to organizing the quality control of employees.  It may not be very convenient, but in principle you can accept the fact that the recordings come only by e-mail or the fact that they cannot be uploaded via the API - we talked about the differences in offers and opportunities for recording voice from different providers in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/iptelefon/blog/307770/">last post</a> . <br><br>  However, the real problem occurs when the recording simply ‚Äúdisappears‚Äù.  After all, in fact, even if 90-99% of the records are in place, the lack of some part of the conversations may be critical, since according to Murphy's law, they are most often needed for analysis.  But ultimately, what are you paying for if you can‚Äôt get all the recordings of conversations?

      So, we collect statistics: why records disappear from clients of cloud PBX: <br><br><h4>  <b>1. The conversation is not fully recorded.</b> </h4><br>  Customers who come to us with inquiries from other operators often face such a problem as incomplete recording of conversations.  This phenomenon is very common on the popular open source cloud telephony platform Asterisk.  For example, if the secretary calls the client on request, specifies what he needs and connects with the employee, it turns out that the conversation itself is not recorded at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e0d/a49/084/e0da49084b844a329eb5ab0713cc5e91.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The secret in this case is simple: the fact is that the recording takes place in relation to one of the participants in the conversation, most often to the first participant.  And the first participant is the secretary.  And if he does not have a desire to listen to how the client will communicate with the employee of the company, the recording will be terminated at the moment when the secretary hangs up.  In our virtual PBX Hive, this problem was cured by a special addition of functionality that ‚Äúuntied‚Äù the recording from the first participant in the conversation.  However, as practice shows, a number of cloud PBX services do not even suspect that such a bug exists in the platform used. <br><br><h4>  <b>2. New conversations disappeared</b> </h4><br>  One of the most common problems is the disappearance of a whole bunch of conversations, in particular, the most recent ones.  The reason may be very simple.  For example, due to restrictions on the storage of conversations on the operator‚Äôs server, available capacity may suddenly run out.  There may be different situations - the client may not notice the notice that the place ends, the notification is able to fly to the spam folder, or the stream of conversations may be suddenly active.  A typical example: a software company released a buggy version of its product, and calls to technical support fell in such a volume that no one had expected.  And it would be good to analyze them ... but the place ended and the last conversations were not recorded.  To avoid this situation, <a href="http://www.iptelefon.su/">IPtelefon</a> offers unlimited storage on its servers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a62/540/1db/a625401db9a3471f88b99792a219b105.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <b>3. Old conversations disappeared</b> </h4><br>  The problem is more rare, but, nevertheless, periodically occurring.  Some customers who came to us for ‚Äúunlimited storage‚Äù lost their old call records, as they had incorrectly configured rules for keeping records on previous PBXs.  When space is limited, the unloading of stored records and storage cleaning can be automated, which allows us not to encounter the previous problem - overflow and the inability to save new records.  But this may cause such unpleasant situations as an error during unloading, but at the same time complete removal of old records, or incomplete unloading.  All of this is fraught with the loss of important data that you could use to control quality or even resolve disputes. <br><br><h4>  <b>4. Summed up the download on email</b> </h4><br>  A popular way to save on storage is to upload all entries by email.  And what, cheap and cheerful!  This method is quite suitable if you can reconcile with the frank inconvenience when sorting records and searching not in a specialized system, but, for example, in MS Outlook or the web interface of the mailbox.  But, alas, even taking into account compromises, it is not always possible to guarantee that the sent messages will reach the required mailbox.  Problems can be completely different.  The first and most banal is the overflow of the target box.  Then follows the temporary unavailability of the service (not all stubs will try to send the record several times), as well as hang up to receive large letters - if your employees listened to swearing at the client for more than an hour, for example.  Comments are unnecessary here: if the record is important for you, then uploading to email should be just an extra measure. <br><br><h4>  <b>5. Records are not visible in CRM.</b> <br></h4><br>  However, even those companies that consider it necessary to work with ordered records often face a problem: not all records of conversations with a specific client can be available in his CRM profile.  In fact, this is a fairly frequent problem with insufficient optimization of CRM and PBX collaboration, and some providers (we will not point fingers) will tell you that all records are available in PBX, but may not be displayed in CRM.  Well, we specifically worked on the tight integration of AmoCRM and Hive, and some of our clients appeared precisely because of the reliability of this bundle. <br><br><h4>  <b>One ticket, second ticket ... and travel card.</b> </h4><br>  There is such a series of children's television magazine "Jumble" when the boy rides the bus, and he has one ticket in his right pocket, the second ticket in the left, and in case he loses both, he has a travel card in his inner pocket.  And if it‚Äôs ridiculous on the bus, in the case of recording conversations it‚Äôs more practical.  After all, you record them precisely so that you have them anyway, so the <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/">Hive service</a> offers unlimited storage, <a href="http://hive.zeonpbx.ru/api/">an API connection,</a> access to records via <a href="http://www.amocrm.ru/">AmoCRM</a> , and sending by email.  All this can be used simultaneously by ordering virtual PBX services from <a href="http://www.iptelefon.su/">IPtelefon</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/74f/955/b89/74f955b890134fa3a06e6d7b5a6ef9a8.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309284/</a></p>
