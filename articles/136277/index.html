    <a name="habracut"></a>  The idea was born in late spring, and a fully working version of the application for Android was ready only by November.  Constantly finalizing the service and making adjustments to the functionality. <br><br>  Always wondered: "How to organize communication of strangers who are near or at the same event?".  And there are many such events, be it just a conference, an exhibition, a snack in a cafe or a boring lecture.  To be very clear, according to Pinkle, it is a Twitter implementation with geo-referencing and the absence of such concepts as ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, ‚Äúfollower‚Äù, etc., thereby occupying the very, not yet developed niche, means of communication with surrounding people. <br><br><h4>  Examples of using </h4><br>  For example, if I am at a conference or meeting, I will see what is relevant at the moment, i.e.  thoughts and ideas of people who surround me here and now, and are not thousands of kilometers away. <br><br>  Or you walk down the street and choose which cafe to go to.  There is nothing easier than just asking people around.  To do this, just write messages and get an answer, and maybe an invitation to join, if you like the person who answered you. <br><br>  Another example.  You are sitting in a lecture and falling asleep.  With our service you can communicate and discuss the most pressing problems with your fellow students who are in the same audience. <br><br>  And there may be many such examples, maybe some of the most sought-after ones, we do not yet guess.  No limits and restrictions are imposed, the deeper you scroll through the "message feed", the more distant and outdated will be the displayed messages of users and events.  In other words, at the very top of the list, only the most relevant and interesting. <br><br><h4>  How does the application work? </h4><br>  At the moment, only the application for Android is completely ready, and we will talk about it.  After launch, the user is logged in via Vkontakte or is registered in the old-fashioned way.  Next, the application determines its location and displays a list of recent messages from other users, sorted by distance to us and time.  On the other tab, we see a list of people sorted by distance from us and you can start communicating with each of these users by previewing his profile or winking at him: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9a/14d/a99/c9a14da992b8cf257137579b25bcbc94.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e73/52c/117/e7352c117cda92573b61923ad80adc5c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/abe/bb4/f4c/abebb4f4cd6bb40eabdc4dfeb5ec5290.jpg"><br><br>  Download the Pinkle app from the <a href="https://market.android.com/details%3Fid%3Dru.pinkle">Android Market</a> . <br><br>  Not everyone has to use smartphones and that is why <a href="http://pinkle.ru/">our site</a> completely repeats the functionality of the application, i.e.  A person sitting on our site can easily communicate with other participants who have an application running on the phone.  The site page looks like this, you can see the fields for sending a message: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3b9/010/d49/3b9010d4939fcb2608f556af6de7cbe3.png"><br><br><h4>  Non business incubators are one. </h4><br>  I would like to say a few words about how our team participated in one of the business incubator selections; I will not name it.  It was about two months ago. <br><br>  After the application for participation was processed, a presentation was made with the presentation of our project.  Pinkle was one of the lucky few. We were offered to <s>sell</s> ‚Äúinvestment‚Äù <s>into slavery</s> .  Needless to say, with the conditions that were offered and the pressure with which their lawyers tried to survive, the desire to receive money from them, and it is unclear how much money, immediately disappeared.  Is it normal to prescribe in the contract such a clause "All program code belongs to us", and that at any moment they can dismiss you.  Thank you, thank you ... <br><br>  Later there were negotiations with a private investor and an offer from him, but in the end he was refused.  No longer met with anyone. <br><br>  This service is easily scalable and if everything goes well, I would like to launch Pinkle in the US market.  And do it with the help of an American business incubator. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I understand perfectly well that there is still a lot to be done: website design and applications, add some functionality, finish the application under the iPhone.  I will be glad to any comments on improving our service, as well as likes and recommendations to my friends. <br><br>  If you liked the application and you think that such a service has the right to life and also know how to program under iOS or Symbian, or just think that you can bring something new and useful to the project, then write it.  At the moment, our team consists of three people, we are all graduates of the Physics and Technology Institute and will be happy to see in our ranks a new enthusiastic comrade. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136277/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136277/</a></p>
