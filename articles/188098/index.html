  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Relations enikeyschika and people in work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> I am one of those who came to the IT sector by chance, out of necessity, but now I want to settle for a long time.  At the moment I do not have the opportunity to write comprehensive material on technical topics, because I myself am learning system administration, including here, but I think that knowledge in the souls of users, I managed to learn.  The material is intended for those who ‚Äúfeel ill at ease‚Äù when communicating with 20 year-old pretty ladies from shots, or with a BDSMnogo-looking boss over 50. Let's go: <br><br>  - Interview. <br><br>  I was told that before my arrival a very computer-competent guy was working in the office.  But when he came to the application to the user, they ran away from the office, and then aired the room.  All because he mowed under the macho-rocker-biker (or whatever it‚Äôs right), chose not to wash, not shave, cut greasy hair on the principle - ‚ÄúWhat wouldn‚Äôt interfere‚Äù, in fact the behavior was appropriate - spitting, burping, feathering ** l.  I am far from evaluating it, however, I can assume that this ‚Äúset‚Äù does not lead to peace and understanding. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  I can say with confidence that the first impression on the authorities during the interview will follow you all the way in the office (unless of course you are going to work in it for 20 years, during which the whole team can change).  Interviews are often conducted by senior officials, or immediate superiors, successfully submitting yourself, you will receive a significant bonus in solving organizational, financial, personal issues.  A job interview is selling yourself to these nice people, they don‚Äôt care about your rich inner world, it‚Äôs absolutely irrelevant that you are a Muslim, metalworker, punk, emo, rapper, etc.  Comfort is important in your society. <br>  Therefore, a shirt, jeans, classic shoes, or some kind of sneakers with thin soles will fit perfectly.  The general purity of the body, clothes, deodorant, light (really light, in women sensitivity to smells is stronger, and the bosses are often the ones) fragrance of perfume.  Nails trimmed, hair styled or trimmed.  A toothbrush has been in your mouth since morning, and you are sure that the smelling words will not envelop your professional qualities with chloride mist.  If you have been growing a culture of bacteria in your mouth for several months, then a small, ‚Äúcold shower‚Äù for them in the form of mint plates will benefit both you and them.  Greater, by and large, and you are not expected. <br>  The conversation should be conducted calmly, friendly, it is better not to answer the questions immediately, but after two seconds, there will be time to weigh your answer by yourself, and also the interlocutor will have the opportunity to add a question if necessary.  It seems to me inappropriate to use a large amount of terminology in front of old women or young women, and actually reduces the chances of success - nobody likes to feel like a fool, even in a specialist society.  Remember that in their field you are exactly the same amateur.  The back is straight, the hands are on the table or on the knees, nothing is crossed, the gestures are restrained and smooth (it is necessary to gesticulate, gives you the opportunity to grab attention and add speech).

      - First days. <br><br>  I am absolutely against the performance of unusual tasks.  I think that from the first days there will be a struggle for the opportunity to influence you.  Because all executive system.  admin, this is really a gift to the exploiter.  You can easily replace - an accountant, personnel officer, loader, driver, electrician, plumber, furniture assembler, messenger, home appliance repairman, etc.  Depending on skills, of course, it may even be prepared for you to play the role of a handkerchief for especially touching bookkeepers. <br>  I think that the easiest way is to talk heart to heart.  At any moment, in any place, you lay out all your dislike for the unusual duty, but you do it in the most constructive, reasoned way. <br>  "Sasha, we came onboard KAMAZ with paper, help to scatter" "Svetochka, my dear, I will not do this, because it is clearly not my duty.  Your desire to save does not add zar.  pay me.  However, if in the future such requests will be repeated, then I am ready to think about the price list for the implementation of services unusual for me.  That's when we can agree.  Compose it until next Friday? ‚Äù <br>  Perhaps you think that this will lead to dismissal, blame or even some kind of punishment.  But it is not.  I assure you that the correctly reprimanded petitioner will simply go looking for a more executive man from lawyers, drivers, electricians, she will remember for you only that you cannot be blamed for any uncharacteristic nonsense. <br>  If the place of work is the first or you do not have enough experience, then with the requirements - ‚ÄúFaster, ahhh, faster‚Äù - you can start to fuss.  Vanity, this is the most terrible enemy, this is a sign that you are losing control, and in the area to which you were hired, this is evidence of non-professionalism.  Catch yourself on this thought, inhale deeply, realize that without you she would not be able to work at all.  Ask her not to interfere, move away and continue to further troubleshoot the problem.  It seems to me that being a little slower is more profitable than running around like an electric kettle on any boil.  In the extreme, you can be called to such tasks as - add a bookmark to the browser, turn on / off the UPS, install the cord in the socket and so on, because you are doing everything so quickly.  By the way, the syndrome - ‚ÄúHow long to explain - I will do it myself‚Äù - in the same way leads to this extreme.  Spend 10 minutes explaining the problem to the user, which you can fix in a minute, if you think your mom or even grandmother could handle it. <br><br>  - Mastered, got used, learned, met. <br><br>  You have already established yourself as a specialist, and not a ‚Äúboy in the field.‚Äù  This status you will have to maintain and strengthen constantly.  If everything in the office works like a watch, then this is no reason to relax, if you certainly do not see yourself as an enikeyshchik with zar.  pay in thirty to 40 years.  MMO games and other contact should be limited, both for you and for users, at least from justice.  This will lead to productivity and growth.  Work, read, read, experiment - approximately in such proportion and order, then the growth of you as a specialist will not keep you waiting.  I really hope that there will be articles about becoming on a professional thorny path with an approximate plan of material necessary for a beginner.  While I saw two great articles - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/50008/">habrahabr.ru/post/50008</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/118475/">habrahabr.ru/post/118475</a> You can sketch out a training plan for yourself if you read them and don‚Äôt understand, or can‚Äôt do everything written there. <br>  To corporate parties and other gatherings to go, unfortunately, it is desirable.  Drinking there is absolutely not.  Keep your mind sober and what is called - "Strengthen the connection."  Just chatting for a living with the director, deputies, department heads and other interesting personalities is much easier there.  In Russia, it turned out that informal requests and suggestions have a greater weight, and personal, warm relationships can work wonders.  Work on this, this is not a matter of one month, but the effect is worth it. <br><br>  - Firing. <br><br>  Work sometimes needs to be changed.  I believe that the average tenure should be 1.5-2 years, if you do not see prospects in the future.  board, career growth, corporate training, it is better to change, it will not be worse.  However, the work is better to change prudently.  Searches should begin 3 months before the date of dismissal.  This will allow you to pick up an interesting desk, place, range of responsibilities. <br>  Be sure to look at the possibility of development in a new place.  If you worked in an office with 20 computers, then go for a dozen - idiocy, 40 optimal, 100 for one - idiocy, for 100 cars in those.  department is the best option. <br>  For the same 3 months, I believe, you must notify the authorities.  I can treat your decision differently, but from your side, most often, they are beneficial.  What can a boss do?  Dismiss the same day?  Nonsense, get rid of a specialist extremely reluctantly.  Will you be considered "latex"?  The head would hardly have become the head if he sat in one place all the time.  You need development in a larger organization, in a larger network, you are doing better for yourself.  In principle, this is the same as scolding a child because he grew up with shoes purchased last spring.  He can offer a promotion, the answer is not unequivocal, consider whether it will be possible to work on something over the next year or two that would be useful in the future.  If you write a statement in 2 weeks, then the glory of Latex can really go about you, not everyone lives in Moscow, where you see the last time in your life as a person, so it‚Äôs necessary to think about reputation. <br>  So, you warned the authorities, it can find a person whom you will train, this is also a rather interesting experience, which should be in the arsenal of the righteous system.  admin  Because knowledge that is impossible to convey is meaningless. <br><br>  - Women. <br><br>  Remember - it is always enough for them.  If a man can say - enough, then a woman consumes until it ends.  Add to this cocktail a feeling and habit that the world owes it only because nature has awarded it with well-known differences. <br>  Thus, if you once fell for beauty, for signs of interest in you as a man, fulfilled and saw that there was no continuation, then do not harbor illusions.  Office romances are not uncommon, the server room is a good place for comfort, but to be realistic, then a typical system.  admin, this is not the type of man whom a wet woman rushes to breathe languidly, ready to produce children without thinking about the aliment. <br>  Remember - interest in you in a professional orientation is approximately equal to your personal interest in simpetyazhka.  In other words, having you as a friend is much more beneficial for a woman than having you as your ‚Äúuneasy friend.‚Äù <br>  Remember - about barter and payment.  I'm serious, why do you work at work for money?  Why is it different here? <br><br>  - Men. <br><br>  It's certainly easier here.  Male friendship and mutual assistance are not just words.  There will be people with whom you can go through life, building dreams and plans, and conquering new horizons.  Folded team is always easier than alone. <br><br>  - In outline. <br><br>  Typical system.  admin - this is an introvert, with a flexible mind, good imagination, ingenuity, ability to understand and grasp "on the fly." <br>  Of the minuses of isolation, aggression, distraction, appearance. <br><br>  This may not apply to you personally, but if it does, then you know what to fix. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188098/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188098/</a></p>
