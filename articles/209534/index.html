  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Give way to ambitious goals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the modern world a considerable number of people are engaged in incredible projects from the point of view of the average man.  Someone is creating a humanoid robot right now, and someone is developing a product that can change the industry.  For some, this is a hobby, for others work, but one thing unites such people - they are all creators, whose work makes others admire the boldness of the plan and the ambitious goals. <br><br>  We believe that such goals deserve attention and publicity and, perhaps, you agree with us.  Usually in the media and on information portals we read articles already on finished projects or products, but what if we give potential clients and simply interested people to participate in the creation, discussion and ask their opinions on any account.  The development team often "blinks the eye" and a third-party opinion at such a moment would not hurt. <br><br>  Maybe right now you are engaged in such a project or just decided to create it.  The question is where to talk about your project?  Start your blog?  But in order to make it popular, it will take a lot of time, money and energy to create and promote it, but you don‚Äôt want to do it, you want to send your energy directly to the goal.  At the same time, the project to deliver information is necessary and extremely useful.

Such a diary will be a success story, describing all the progress from beginning to end.  The information is presented in chronological order and allows readers to gradually immerse themselves in the material, unlike a blog, when new posts are usually on top and have to carry links to previous materials in the header of the post.  Posts may not be more than a tweet, and may not pull the whole article.  This format will allow you to leave your notes at any convenient time, and if you consider that SmartProgress has its mobile applications for Android and iOS, then there are really a lot of opportunities. <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smartprogress/blog/194806/">Read more about the service</a> . <br>  More than 24 000 users are registered on SmartProgress, daily attendance of 3000-3500 people. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/V8g3BxxptVo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiQgUlWZx5Mj0TF-VImBHZ0FCJ5WQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  The offer is as follows: </h4><br>  We launched on our site a special kind of goals - special projects. <br>  <b>Special projects allow you to:</b> <br><ul><li>  to highlight the target in the general list; </li><li>  automatically pick it up at every post in the diary; </li><li>  brand it on your own; </li><li>  get a short address. </li></ul><br>  Read more <a href="https://smartprogress.do/site/special">on the promo page.</a> <br>  <a href="https://smartprogress.do/wannafly">An example of a special project goal.</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be8/9c0/123/be89c0123c9d195b55d72b1d51625411.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Why do you need it? </h4><br><ul><li>  We form the first audience for your project / product; </li><li>  We get feedback; </li><li>  Publicity often helps to find like-minded people, partners and even investors; </li><li>  First loyal customers are created. </li></ul><br><br>  Of course, all this is relevant if you describe your work honestly and do it efficiently.  It should be said that the open business on the market has many advantages and even large companies are striving for such openness.  This inspires confidence among potential customers. <br>  For example, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Ffeature%3Dplayer_embedded%26v%3D0uVqbqY1L5c">video case of a young entrepreneur from Syvtyvkar</a> , in which he talks about the advantages of a transparent business in Russian realities. <br><br><h4>  How to participate </h4><br>  We are ready to provide such information support at no cost. <br>  You are required to describe your goal in detail, to formalize it and periodically leave the expanded posts in a diary about the progress in achieving the goal.  Such posts can be further formalized in a full article and publish, for example, on the site. <br><br>  Do you want to open your special project on SmartProgress? <br>  To do this, <a href="https://smartprogress.do/site/special">leave a request on the promotional page</a> .  We will review it and contact as soon as possible. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209534/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209534/</a></p>
