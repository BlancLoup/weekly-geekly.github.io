The highest growth is expected from the IaaS segment - according to forecasts in 2016 it will rise by 38.4%. <br><br>  In the future, a fairly large jump is expected: by <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/2739/cloud-infrastructure-as-a-service/">2019</a> , the IaaS segment will reach 130 billion, while spending on hardware and software, according to Forbes, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/louiscolumbus/2016/03/13/roundup-of-cloud-computing-forecasts-and-market-estimates-2016/">may</a> grow from 25 billion dollars in 2015 to 173 billion dollars in 2016. What caused this rapid growth ?  New opportunities for the development of IaaS provides a high ‚Äúpace of perception‚Äù of service by small and medium-sized businesses and modern trends: mobility and the ability to work from your own device (BYOD - Bring Your Own Device). <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/309028/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2db/58c/0d1/2db58c0d1500458395dd42746c360a59.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a>  <i>/ photo <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/89228431%40N06/">reynermedia</a> <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i>

      According to <a href="http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/3188817">Syd Neg</a> , head of research and analytics at Gartner, this steady growth reflects the transition from obsolete technology to cloud technology due to the current trend towards innovation.  IaaS continues to grow, as many companies trust the maintenance of infrastructure to cloud services. <br><br><h3>  Who is involved in the IaaS market: Gartner opinion </h3><br>  At the dawn of the appearance of public clouds, the main part of the market was occupied by small technical companies and innovative companies.  But today, when cloud technologies are gaining popularity, the largest IT firms have joined the game.  Now the leading positions in the market are occupied by large firms, so other providers are forced to attract customers, for example, at the expense of interesting additional services (which only benefits the consumers). <br><br>  <a href="http://www.softwaremag.com/iaas-forecsst-cloudy-and-complex">John Engates</a> , technical director of Rackspace, confirms this with his example: his company decided to stop competing with major providers, such as Amazon and Microsoft, in 2014, and focused on its proprietary ‚Äúfanatical IT support‚Äù service. <br><br>  Gartner Vice President <a href="https://www.datapipe.com/blog/2015/05/21/iaas-adoption-is-burgeoning">Lydia Ling</a> believes that not all providers cope with all types of workload equally well, so the choice by a provider of a specific niche is beneficial for everyone: ‚ÄúThe IaaS cloud is not a product of mass consumption; and conditions. "  Another example of such a ‚Äúniche‚Äù company is CenturyLink, which stands out due to ‚Äúend-to-end‚Äù solutions.  The companies are confident that such solutions reduce risks, total cost of ownership and make it possible to scale as your business grows. <br><br><h3>  Customer expectations </h3><br>  IaaS is becoming more popular, so why customers choose such a solution for their business?  According to a study conducted by <a href="http://www.ashtonmetzler.com/The%2520Adoption%2520of%2520IaaS.pdf">Ashton, Metzler &amp; Associates</a> , two main factors are cost reduction and a rapid increase in productivity (30.4% of respondents each chose these answer options).  Usually, providers provide IaaS service on an ‚Äúon demand‚Äù system or in pay-as-you-go format, which are considered the most cost effective options.  This is another reason why customers choose IaaS (14%). <br><br>  Also among the reasons are the reduction of time required for the introduction of new functionality (26.3%) and the implementation of the best available solutions (19.3%).  For IT organizations, another important reason to turn to cloud technologies is the speed at which innovations are introduced.  Firms themselves are forced to respond quickly to any changes, which they also require from their infrastructure. <br><br><h3>  Hybrid cloud </h3><br>  A fairly popular security solution is to use a private version of a public cloud.  In general, the hybrid cloud is already used by <a href="https://www.rightscale.com/lp/state-of-the-cloud">71% of companies</a> , for comparison, in <a href="http://www.rightscale.com/lp/2015-state-of-the-cloud-report%3Fcampaign%3D701700000012UP6">2015</a> this figure was only 58%.  According to experts, such an interest in the hybrid cloud will affect the growth of the IaaS market. <br><br>  Placing data in a private cloud is considered the most secure, but also the most expensive, and the hybrid cloud combines a number of advantages: security, confidentiality, the ability to recover important data and business continuity. <br><br>  Hybrid cloud allows organizations to interact with customers through a public cloud and store data in a private cloud.  But such a system is quite difficult to operate, as it is necessary to ensure the operation of all platforms: both cloud and physical data storage centers. <br><br><h3>  Cloud security </h3><br>  With all the advantages of using cloud technologies, one of the main issues remains the security of this method of data storage.  Along with preserving the integrity of the data and the continuity of business processes, data security refers to the <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/solutions/collateral/service-provider/global-cloud-index-gci/Cloud_Index_White_Paper.html">risks</a> involved in using such services.  However, according to the RightScale <a href="https://www.rightscale.com/lp/state-of-the-cloud">State of the Cloud</a> study, this issue, if not resolved (29% of respondents still consider security as a problem), then faded into the background. <br><br>  For the main consumers of IaaS, which include IT and telecommunications, banks, financial and insurance companies, and the healthcare sector, security and confidentiality are undoubtedly the main priorities.  Large streams of personal data, financial and medical information do not allow companies to ignore security measures, so serious amounts are spent on their strengthening every year. <br><br>  Security issues will not lose their relevance, if only because the number of users of cloud services is constantly growing, as is the number of potential threats.  In this regard, technologies in the field of security are constantly being improved, and today providers offer integrated protection and security, strict compliance with the law, high encryption speed and other solutions. <br><br>  <i>PS Additional reading: Our <b><a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-grad/blog/309022/">IaaS digest</a></b> - 30 materials on the applicability of cloud technologies.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/309028/">https://habr.com/ru/post/309028/</a></p>
