  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hello, SaaS | Cloud events</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I decided to expand the subject of posts about SaaS towards the clouds as a whole and there are several reasons for this.  Firstly, this is due to the fact that all the SaaS topics have already been exhausted and there is no longer any desire to follow the second round.  Secondly, while the posts had more format of hypotheses, reasoning and experiments with the model of the current product and I still want to give them more practicality and color. <br><br>  At the same time, I do not plan to go far from binding to SaaS, and I promise to make the new format of posts brighter and more realistic.  Today, the pilot post series "Cloud events". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/290/5ca/c30/2905cac30f9a44beb8b827108684c2d0.jpg"><br>  <i>Under the sign of innovation and 3X for the five-year period</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>New Post Format</b>

      These will be posts about cloud events in terms of opportunities for the development and improvement of SaaS services, in particular my current project - <a href="https://dentalcloud.pro/">Dental Cloud</a> .  To reduce advertising degrees, I will write about the event in terms of: <br><br><ul><li>  tasks to make SaaS products better in terms of technology or products that facilitate their integration into corporate systems or marketing channels. </li><li>  values ‚Äã‚Äãof solutions announced at an event that I can potentially use in my company to automate it. </li></ul><br>  About the event itself will be a minimum of information - a description, the best speaker and the best report.  We all understand that the vendor conference is still an event with its magic and its stars, and the post will not be complete if you don‚Äôt tell about ‚ÄúWow!  News "and will not share it with a respected reader. <br><br>  <b>Why go to the conference at all?</b> <br><br>  As always, I have guests and, to be honest, all of 2015, I was busy with my startup and did not attend more than one cloud event.  Now I came to my senses and invited a guest - who reminded me of how to integrate into events.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/stepan.danilov%3Ffref%3Dts">Stepan Danilov</a> - the founder of the service <a href="http://meyou.ru/">Meyou</a> told how to attend conferences correctly and what goals to set for yourself. <br><br><ul><li>  An effective conference is 50% of the content from the speakers and 50% is communication / dating.  Because the common things voiced by speakers are already in stackoverflow or forums.  But the experience of using these things is different for everyone and features are covered in details.  Which is useful to know when in person.  Not necessarily with speakers.  Communication is also useful for finding out opinions on approaches, methods of work and life hacking.  IT specialists in a huge mass are shy introverts who will freely communicate in ‚Äúcocoons‚Äù with familiar people, and rarely make new acquaintances.  IT conferences are a little different from any other ones, because at first they don‚Äôt look for warm leads and partners.  This slightly changes the meaning of dating, but does not negate their usefulness. </li><li>  Transfer of relevant competencies.  Current market players tell fresh decisions.  This is more useful than just online training, as there is feedback. </li><li>  Place of actualization of experts and specialists.  If you do not go to the conference, no one knows about you.  If you are not invited to speak at conferences, they do not consider you an expert. </li><li>  Place actualization of market players.  Any market consists of those companies that are noticeable in this market.  Conferences are a good thermometer of well-being and company size.  According to the materials, the presence format, that is, how the companies are represented, it is possible to subjectively determine which market leaders are alive, active and how they are doing. </li><li>  Place and time for useful acquaintances (how to get to know each other and what kind of communication tools are there).  If the conference is modern, it will have either a service or an application where there is a guest list with contacts.  In Russia, it is only in its infancy.  It is advisable to find interested parties and offer to meet on coffee breaks.  So that you are not sent to write any question or specifics. </li></ul><br>  <b>Magic Citrix Technology Exchange 2016</b> <br><br>  The first event of the series that I attended was the <a href="https://www.citrix.ru/">Citrix</a> Technology Exchange.  The conference was held on February 11 in Moscow.  The keynote of the conference was the company's breakthrough in areas such as mobile access management, virtual infrastructure and applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/af0/aa2/034/af0aa2034a77413ab1c24a385d653f2a.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Wow!</b>  <b>News</b> <br><br>  At the end of January, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kirill-tatarinov-493a0119">Cyril Tatarinov was</a> appointed CEO of Citrix, and now the development vector of the company will definitely be about technology. <br><br>  <b>Event stars</b> <br><br>  Thomas Zell and Thomas Berger, who shared the results of 2015 and told about the company's product strategy.  Perhaps the most interesting thing in the reports was that in 2015 the level of innovations - new proposals, products and improvement packages doubled compared with the past 4 years, and this is impressive!  The second point - the company's product strategy has become clear, simple, but at the same time effective.  To formulate it roughly as follows - ‚ÄúSecure application delivery, networks and data.‚Äù  From the strategy you can see which products in the future the company will focus on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f79/167/d0c/f79167d0c1eb405681869e639eeb3b45.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Finds to improve Dental Cloud</b> <br><br>  Most Citrix products are focused on building private clouds, organizing the company's infrastructure, and delivering company applications through virtual desktops.  Is there a place in the history for SaaS? <br><br>  So far, I saw that the whole line of the company is still focused on creating and managing solutions for large corporate customers.  Although it is possible to look at <a href="https://www.citrix.ru/">Citrix</a> products, from the point of view of integration into the clinic‚Äôs corporate environment and the possibility of mobile application delivery  Look at Citrix-based DaaS solutions.  The new version of XenApp was announced support for <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/">Azure Microsoft</a> , but this announcement will have to figure out and understand how this will help my cloud service. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c95/09a/335/c9509a3352594c80be56cfc7b7b7436f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Content + or on the sidelines</b> <br><br>  And where, if not on the sidelines of events get a "dose" of useful content?  I received all the answers to my questions precisely in the intervals between presentations from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/skhalyapin%3Ffref%3Dts">Sergey Halyapin</a> .  Sergey gave me useful comments on pumping my service. <br><br>  <i>- How to improve SaaS (browser services)?</i>  <i>Does it make sense to improve - such services are available from any form factor from the public cloud?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The problem is actually very simple and many people have come across it - under one browser the site opens and works, under another we see only part of the content, and the third does not open the site at all.</i>  <i>In the corporate environment, a number of web applications from the point of view of technical support are generally very tightly tied to a certain type of Internet browser (including the version).</i>  <i>With the help of the new feature, when publishing links to internal or external web sites, it will be possible to specify which browser they should open.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>As a result, on the access portal, the end user sees the application icons and when they start up, the administrator-defined browser will open and the corresponding website will open in it.</i> <br><br>  <i>- We conditionally build our public cloud on a) hardware b) in the provider's virtual environment - what products will help me and in short how?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Depending on what is going to be deployed in the cloud.</i>  <i>If you need virtual applications or desktops, then <a href="https://www.citrix.ru/products/xenapp/overview.html">XenApp</a> and XenDesktop can be integrated with <a href="https://www.citrix.ru/products/cloudplatform/overview.html">CloudPlatform</a> , AWS and Azure out of the box.</i>  <i>In the case of other cloud infrastructures, you will need to install within virtual machines, but cloud services (portals, etc.) will not be available.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>You can use XenServer including the available as a free product (but there will be no possibility to purchase technical support).</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>You can use the Citrix Cloud Bridge to connect the clouds to each other or to connect the cloud with the corporate environment to optimize the transfer of data over the WAN channels, as well as to form the IPSec VPN tunnel.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If web servers are deployed in the public cloud, then <a href="https://www.citrix.ru/products/netscaler-application-delivery-controller/overview.html">Citrix NetScaler is</a> recommended to use a virtual or physical device for balancing and protecting traffic (SSL VPN and / or Web Application Firewall), or now you can also use container technologies - NetScaler CPX containers.</i> <i><br></i> <br>  <i>- How can Citrix products optimally transfer personal data to Russia?</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>For example, build your private cloud using <a href="https://www.citrix.ru/products/xenserver/overview.html">XenServer</a> , NetScaler.</i>  <i>It all depends on the tasks.</i>  <i>You can even host a <a href="https://www.citrix.ru/products/sharefile/overview.html">Citrix ShareFile</a> file sharing resource in a corporate environment, but anonymous credentials will need to be placed in a Citrix cloud.</i> <br><br>  Excellent - for the day of the event to make your service better! <br><br>  <b>Finds for the company</b> <br><br>  For the organization of work in the company, I was interested to look at the solution to support the users of <a href="https://www.citrix.ru/products/gotoassist/overview.html">GoToAssist Service Desk</a> in it implements the ITIL standard and it is quite simple.  In addition to supporting me, I was potentially interested in the line for organizing communications in a team and with users - GoToMeeting GoToTraining GoToWebinar GoToWebcast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/56f/aba/ce6/56fabace626e43bba02377e2ef98c173.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Informally</b> <br><br>  At the conference, it was pleasant to meet many colleagues from Microsoft, DELL companies, partners and friends, and it was even more pleasant that the conference was ‚Äúalive‚Äù by inviting partner companies and holding panel discussions and technological debates, and <a href="">Oleg Sedov</a> greatly helped his colleagues , who added the drive and drew, first discussing the impact of information in the modern world in the panel discussion ‚ÄúHow information affects our destiny‚Äù, and then the ‚ÄúAsk an Expert‚Äù format, which involved one-on-one communication with an expert and discussion  e questions together with the audience present - fresh and boldly turned out. <br><br>  <b>Instead of total, logo and agents</b> <br><br>  I am sure that the first event of the year was successful - firstly, after a pause of a year to visit the information atmosphere of colleagues and friends - it‚Äôs great.  Secondly, I decided to set myself the task - we are already testing several solutions for ourselves, and third, the colleagues' announcements were pleased with the news about new technology alliances, the vision of the development strategy of Citrix products and the drive! <br><br>  As a user, I was impressed by the video from the presentation of colleagues about the comparison of <a href="https://www.citrix.com/news/announcements/jan-2014/citrix-adquire-a-framehawk-br.html">Framehawk</a> with a competitor.  The essence of the video - the tablet screen moves instantly in terms of mobile (adverse) access.  As for competitors, there is no scrolling as such - the page does not respond to touch at all. <br><br>  And yes, the conference began with a Bondiad-style video.  The agents who use the company's solutions were the employees of the Citrix office in London.  The plot of the video about the agents ‚Äôforay into the medieval castle organically continued the dance of agents on the stage of the Swissotel Red Hills Conference Center. <br><br>  Previous Author Posts <br>  <a href="https://megamozg.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Megamogs</a> <br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/evseyfaydo/topics/">Habrahabr</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298696/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298696/</a></p>
