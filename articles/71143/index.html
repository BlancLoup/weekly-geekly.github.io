We decided to look at the area and estimate that such interesting things can be found for filming.  We didn‚Äôt take video soap trays with us - we decided to go for a quick ride, and ... a ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù move from our side ... but more on that below. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We decided to drive along the banks of the Volga, along the beach, from Yagodny to Khryaschevka. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4f1/203/151/4f1203151e7953c9467bd1be5beed770.jpg"><br><br>  We left for lunch, the sun was not special, but not too sad - nothing foreshadowed trouble :).  With a breeze rushing along the beach - it was great! <br>  After a couple of puddles, our feet were wet - very badly upset (Who knew what adventures await us ahead).  We thought that next time we should put the bags on our feet.

      Soon began to come across unpleasant clay areas.  Outwardly, they were no different from a dense surface - everywhere there was a small layer of sand on top.  When you pass a unsteady patch, the motorcycle suddenly loses its speed ... and with a successful set of circumstances, it passes on a slip. <br>  We decided to turn off the dangerous section of the road, turn diagonally and both of them settled.  I don‚Äôt remember exactly how we pulled the bikes, later events eclipsed those memories in my mind.  The only thing I remember is that they are tired enough, Stepan lost his shoes a couple of times in the swamp slush, and they all got dirty in the mud.  For about 20 minutes, they were pulled out, and after that the following dialogue took place: <br><blockquote>  Me: Dude!  Ofiget, here we planted them. <br>  Stepan: - Yes, cool.  This is an enduro thrill. <br>  Me: Well, you know, I had a feeling that we would not just ride, but would get stuck somewhere (My instinct did not let me down!). <br>  Stepan: I hope we still plant them along the way? <br>  Me: ??? (Shocked.) Well, dude, of course it's cool, but I hope we‚Äôre going to get there without incident. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Let's go further - damn!  - you do not know how to drive: the protector is covered in clay, the motorcycle rolls from side to side, brings in, not the beach but the swamp around.  And it puts it in such a way that once I didn‚Äôt taxi and fell into the low side. <br>  We slipped through a dangerous area, drove into the water to bring down the clay, and drove on. <br><br>  Without any adventures we reached the Gryaschevka - and there the solitary kiters (bye-bye, ended), a couple of windsurfers and an empty kitter base.  They drove there, cut circles, had fun.  I drove along the water's edge, and ... well, you can guess:) ... there was a hidden pit under the water by a meter by two, where I famously fell.  Motorcycle filter went into the water - I immediately drowned it and dragged to the shore. <br><br>  I remove the filter protection cover - seemingly clean, without sand and water - well, so, the very smallness of the filter is wet.  There should be no special problems, there was no hydraulic shock either.  Begin to start - barely start.  I keep trying - it started up, but it works at extremely low speeds and if you add gas - it immediately stalls. <br><blockquote>  Inner voice: What kind of nafik is this? <br>  Me: Well, somewhere the water is not filled there.  In principle, there should not be any problems - it will expire. <br></blockquote><br><br>  It turned out that not a mistake.  I waited 15 minutes and there was no improvement.  There was a thought that somewhere in the carburetor there was water ... I tried to drain by unscrewing the fuel bolt of the carburetor - it was not there!  - Forgot the hexagons at home.  I tried to fill up on my side so that gasoline poured from the pipes.  And then I found out :) that if you tilt to the left side - the motorcycle immediately stalls, and if on the right - it allows you to turn the momentum.  I could not make a clever conclusion from this, and just tilted to my right side and gave Gari!  In a minute the motorcycle lane as if nothing had happened ... <br><br>  Well, that's all, half the way is passed - it's time to go home.  The evening is still far away, like the moon on foot.  Let's go slowly. <br><br>  We are riding, trotting through the puddles and small streams - slowly washing away the clay after slugging in the mud.  We drive to a long and narrow puddle. <br><blockquote>  Stepan: Let's drive through the puddle. <br>  I: Along? <br>  Stepan: Well, yes - in a puddle. <br>  Me: Well, figlie, come on. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Let's go and then I feel knit, well, and pulled in strontium.  Stepan looked at me and rushed in the same line.  KAPETS - sat down so that the motorcycle got stuck right on the muffler and he continued to sink. <br>  Clay sucked the bike almost as quickly as the mortgage sucks me.  They took turns guarding, grasping the trunk - they did not let him go to the bottom.  You try to pull out - you plunge.  Well, of course, everything that we managed to keep dry at this point, we immediately wet it. :) <br>  At first they shook bitsuha - they poked motorcycles with their hands - the result was zero. <br>  Then they brought logs, began to make levers - the result was zero, they tied themselves up, they lost their shoes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/46a/123/ed7/46a123ed75f1616b0a51b683495bc638.jpg"><br><br>  They spat on one motorcycle and went to pull out my Jebel - he, it seems, did not sit down so heavily. <br>  Stepa proposed to use the original method, for some reason he was sure that this method was doomed to success: <br><blockquote>  Stepan: We must lift the front wheel, drag it in the direction we need and turn the bike on the opposite side.  Repeat the cycle until a satisfactory result is obtained.  When the motorcycle will look where it is necessary, we will try to shake gas. <br>  I: Well, since my idea with logs and levers screwed up - let's try yours. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Well, in 10 minutes we pulled out the mote.  The dry shore was not far away - in 1.5 meters, and we unrolled the motorcycle in 9 minutes where we needed it, started it up and in a minute we had been teasing it to a solid surface.  By the way, if we, when we noticed the chacha, turned in the other direction, we would not be stuck at all. <br><br>  We return to our utoplinku ... We try to turn the front wheel the same way we did it with Jebel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ec/0eb/686/5ec0eb6862c5eb1d22f8f5553fa1a54a.jpg"><br><br>  It is impossible - the bike sat down so that the dirt completely covers the rear wheel.  We try to dig out with our hands - in vain.  As a result, we built a mega-block of logs and slipped it under the pendulum.  I lay down on the front wheel, and Stepa was on the block.  And we started the frictions :) One - two - three -...- fifty - and the rear wheel gave way!  Came out slowly. <br><br>  Well, the next is easier - laid on its side and dragged out more or less without incident. <br>  Began to start - fuck there.  Everything is completely flooded. <br>  I decided to go in search of a cable in order to either start from the pusher, or drag in tow to the house (20 kilometers on a straight line, 60 roads on the roads). <br><blockquote>  Oh, how wrong I was!  This decision was a fatal mistake ... <br></blockquote><br><br>  I drove back along the shore, we drove through the boat station and I would definitely find there something like a cable.  In order not to set aside for the moronic again, I drove along our tracks and where we skidded - drove around ... <br><blockquote>  Inner voice: This is nothing, that everything is so vague here - you will break through!  You are a real alpha male! <br></blockquote><br><br>  Well ... no one could imagine, right?  :) ... that as I was walking around the next dangerous site, I got to my feet!  And the place is like that - a liquid liquid, nothing nearby is solid and the hut at once - and half went to chacha. <br><blockquote>  I (mentally): @ # $ !!!  % ^ &amp; * () !!!  Well, I'm for the alpha moron! <br>  I (to the inner voice): Thanks for the help! <br></blockquote><br><br>  It's all as usual - I miss the hour / two attempts to get out alone, I will describe only the key points: <br><ul><li>  Pipets.  I'm alone, I'll never get him out ... </li><li>  I drowned a bunch of branches, boards, something else in this slush - it's useless.  Everything is so fragile that it just went down into nowhere. </li><li>  Everything except the head was covered with a centimeter layer of dirt.  I crawled in the mud and floundered in her like shitty. </li><li>  Once I got stuck with both of my legs and hands and was able to get out just by pushing away from the chacha with my manhood.  And so already said goodbye to life. </li><li>  I did not begin to return on foot for the help of the Steppe ‚Äî I thought that sooner or later he would become bored and he would come. </li><li>  A clever idea :) - he dug a canal with his hands to the side, through which he pumped a fair amount of water from that chacha. </li><li>  I still have vague memories of how I got out.  Somehow tricky trick, I still managed to pull the mot out of chacha and centimeter by centimeter, lying on my back, drag him to a dry place. </li></ul><br><br>  After that, the forces left only to wash in the cold Volga and go further for the cable.  There was no force left at all, so the way home was like a slideshow: <br><ul><li>  I found a cable. </li><li>  Returned to the motorcycle and stepe.  (I really met him on the way to help me :)) </li><li>  Brought a motorcycle. </li><li>  Returned and gave the cable. </li><li>  My headlight burned out.  And it was a black night. </li><li>  The two of us went along the roads - many, many kilometers, long, long, cold and cold. </li><li>  We arrived home.  I grabbed a bunch of clothes and a motorbike and dropped into the bathroom. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e29/fb6/a8a/e29fb6a8a7ec1d502b3293d199c91d84.jpg"><br>  We are with a motorcycle - clean after swimming in the Volga. <br><br>  <b>Statistics:</b> <br>  The whole journey took no more than 8 hours. <br>  Completed 120 kilometers. <br>  The form I can not wash and dry so far. <br><br>  At the weekend we are going to take additional equipment and return to those places with cameras :) A little scary ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71143/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71143/</a></p>
