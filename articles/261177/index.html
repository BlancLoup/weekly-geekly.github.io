The percentage of successful heart operations, municipal statistics on the types of the disease, data on causes of death, and much more </li><li>  data on the activities of law enforcement agencies.  These are statistics with detail up to division and depersonalized information on each crime. </li></ul><br><br>  Virtually all of these data sets are described in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/207772/Open_Data_Charter.pdf">G8 open data charter,</a> and all of them are considered the most important and priority for citizens.

      Let us dwell on law enforcement data. <br><br>  Their peculiarity is such that in different countries law enforcement functions are carried out in different ways.  If in Russia or in Great Britain the police is a single structure of vertical subordination, then in the USA there are many police departments at the level of individual states and separate counties. <br><br>  If in some countries there are separate departments for the analysis of criminal statistics, in others it is all part of the functions of police departments and prosecutors. <br><br>  In the US, most recently Barack Obama created a special initiative of the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/05/18/launching-police-data-initiative">Police Data Initiative</a> just to improve the quality of openness of police departments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is a difficult and interesting story, given the difficulties described above with the way the "vertical of power" is arranged in the United States. <br><br>  About how the disclosure is going on right now in the United States can be seen on the special project <a href="https://codeforamerica.github.io/PoliceOpenDataCensus/">Police Open Data Census</a> made in the Sunlight Foundation.  Here is a catalog of US police departments. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c6/237/b9f/1c6237b9f22b4aad98996d35c72a1e79.png"><br><br>  At the same time in the world there are many services that use data in practice.  Portals such as SpotCrime and Crimereports aggregate a wealth of data about each crime.  And real estate companies use data on criminal statistics to assess the attractiveness of real estate. <br><br>  In other countries, there are also initiatives on the openness of law enforcement.  There are also in Russia, although not yet on such a scale.  The <a href="http://crimestat.ru/">Crimestat.ru</a> portal can be considered as the first swallow, but it also needs serious development. <br><br>  At the Open Data Council, on behalf of Infoculture, we will discuss the development of this topic, talk with the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Prosecutor‚Äôs Office and other law enforcement agencies about what their data and in what form should be available. <br><br>  To make this possible, it is very important for us to find out who will use this data and how.  And maybe someone already uses something close to them. <br><br>  Therefore, I ask everyone to follow the link and fill in the <a href="https://ru.surveymonkey.com/r/PFWDTZ6">‚ÄúOpen law enforcement data‚Äù mini-survey</a> form. <br><br>  The results of this survey will go to the council for open data and will be transferred to the authorities responsible for publishing criminal statistics. <br><br>  And also I will be grateful to all meaningful suggestions and comments that can be left both in the survey and in this post. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261177/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261177/</a></p>
