  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HDTV Implementation Factors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At present, the television services market is represented by on-air, satellite, cable television.  ‚ÄúDigital TV‚Äù is often associated with information technologies, on the basis of which Web-TV (unicast) and IPTV (multicast) are implemented.  However, a set of standards for television broadcasting of high quality HDTV (High-Definition Television) is focused not only on cable, but also on satellite networks.  High-definition television systems were developed in the 1950s by major industrial powers (USA, Japan, etc.) and a pan-European consortium.  In the USSR, there were also similar developments. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the late 1950s, the Moscow Transformation Research Institute (MNITI) created an experimental Transformer military-staff communications system, which allowed transmitting images with a resolution of 1125 lines [2]. <br><br>  Since HDTV is currently broadcasting in digital form, virtually any digital channel with a sufficient level of quality (QoS) is suitable for transmitting content, that is, of sufficient width (15-25 Mbit / s for MPEG-2 or 8-12 Mbit / c for MPEG-4 - depending on the degree of compression) and guaranteeing a certain acceptable level of signal delay (1‚Äì10 s, depending on the buffer size of the receiving device and requirements for signal delay). <br><br>  The implementation of new functions and services in the television services market is becoming possible on the basis of innovative technologies.  In turn, the innovation process and the development of individual television services in particular are affected by various technical, organizational, political and economic factors.

      It should be noted that the modern electronics market is quite saturated and the rush demand for new services and new equipment is quite rare.  It is possible that only 3D and holographic television will be able to really revive the television services market.  However, these technologies are currently based on optical illusion;  require the use of special color, polarization, shutter, glasses and perceived nothing more than entertaining toys.  Therefore, the current level of development of technologies, both holographic and 3DTV technologies, can be defined as intermediate and evolutionary rather than innovative and strategically significant.  3D will be easily fixed in cinemas, but it will come to the house to ‚Äúevery grandmother‚Äù very, very soon.  The dynamics of the innovation process, technical capabilities and the dynamics of demand for services coincide only partially, and therefore manufacturers create it artificially, gradually ceasing production and support of old devices and formats.  So, according to the latest estimates, about 80-90% of TVs presented in retail chains support HD [4].  It turns out that consumers buy equipment already ready for new services, sometimes even unaware of it.  However, even if it is possible to use a certain HDTV service, the potential consumer perceives this function ‚Äúwithout enthusiasm‚Äù.  In tab.  1 shows the comparative cost characteristics of SD (standard definition) and HD channels provided by operators of the Sverdlovsk region.  The consumer often prefers to limit himself to standard features, acquiring a service at a price of 5-10 times less than receiving a service of higher quality, but more expensive. <br><br>  Table 1 <br>  Comparative characteristics of the cost of SD and HD channels in Yekaterinburg <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  utel.TV </td><td>  Planet </td><td>  HTB + </td><td>  Your tv </td></tr><tr><td>  Standard quality </td><td>  2-4 rub / channel </td><td>  13-17 rub / channel </td><td>  2-4 rub / channel </td><td>  3.5-8.5 rubles / channel </td></tr><tr><td>  HDTV </td><td>  60 rub / channel </td><td>  39-79 rubles / channel </td><td>  11.7 rubles / channel </td><td>  31 rub / channel </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  The technical factors on which the development of HDTV depends include: <br>  ‚Ä¢ new requirements for television receivers (HD Ready / Full HD format); <br>  ‚Ä¢ changes in content requirements (HD content producers are very few, and they are 1.5‚Äì2 more expensive than ‚Äúnormal‚Äù); <br>  ‚Ä¢ improvement of network infrastructure (for the implementation of HDTV, the speed of 8-10 Mbit / s on the ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù is necessary, taking into account the need to access the Internet via the same line with speeds of 5-10 Mbit / s, the access network must be gigabit); <br>  ‚Ä¢ the emergence of new set-top boxes (support for HD, MPEG-4). <br><br>  The easiest way to broadcast HDTV is to those operators who work using HFC technology, that is, transmit data over a coaxial cable.  The key advantage of HFC over other wired technologies is that it has the maximum potential bandwidth in all parts of the network and allows you to provide the necessary speed bands for transmitting HD signals.  At the same time, the frequency band occupied by one HD channel is from 8 to 12 Mbps.  No reorganization of the HFC network is required.  As for other technologies in this area, in IPTV and Ethernet networks some effort is required to organize broadcasting of HD content. <br><br>  When organizing HD content broadcasting on IPTV networks, the situation is fundamentally different, since  some effort is required to ensure quality of service.  The operator needs to allocate a frequency band with the required QoS of at least 150 Mbit / s on the trunk and lower (subscriber access section, ‚Äúlast mile‚Äù channel) of the Ethernet network segment.  Here it is necessary to take into account the fact that such a band can also be given for the organization of Internet access, which will result in greater financial gain for the operator, since  The income from the services of HD-TV today is not comparable with the profitability of Internet services. <br><br>  Meanwhile, some of the major operators providing services in HD say that the development of HDTV is somewhat hampered by a number of factors.  Most televisions sold in the last five (and possibly more) years are not used according to passport data.  Watch 4: 3 programs on a 16: 9 TV, and 576 (625) lines on a 720 or even 1080 TV are not a very reasonable investment.  In addition, the development is slowed down: an expensive entrance ticket (to view HDTV you need a corresponding set-top box, which costs more, and the subscription fee for the package is much higher), and the low variety of offers.  In addition, there are very few TV channels that show ‚ÄúReal HD‚Äù.  A lot of materials are converted from SD.  Quality, of course, does not improve. <br><br>  One of the political factors that noticeably hinders the development of national HDTV in Russia is that the bulk of the content is made in 4: 3 format, and ITU, in its recommendation, proposed a unified 16: 9 frame for all countries.  For possible savings, the Scientific and Research Institute of Television has proposed, developed and approved GOST R 53533-2009 with a 15: 9 aspect ratio.  Thus, the Russian HD-TV format with a frame of 15: 9 is obtained by adding an additional band to the screen at the bottom of the screen (Fig. 1). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/217/a17/ff0/217a17ff031f4b5738107f866a1c1381.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Fig.  1. Frame formats HDTV ITU and GOST <br><br>  Problems with the implementation of the national standard HD broadcasting may face content producers.  From the point of view of the production of programs, there will be difficulties, this frame format is not supported by the equipment that produces the picture, that is, cameras, video recorders, editing.  Reformatting under the new GOST will mean additional costs.  Now most broadcasters can take an HD channel directly from the satellite and deliver it to the consumer, complementing the transfer, now it will be necessary to take the original version from the satellite, reformat it, then pick it up again and deliver it to the Russian consumer in this form. <br>  Thus, it can be assumed that a promising direction of development of the television services market is the creation of a network of television broadcasting of enhanced quality HDTV (High-Definition Television), which, despite the difficulties, in the near future will become one of the main television services. <br><br>  BIBLIOGRAPHIC LIST <br>  1. <a href="http://www.mskit.ru/news/n90783/">www.mskit.ru/news/n90783</a> <br>  2. <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDTV">ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDTV</a> <br>  3. <a href="http://vasilievaa.narod.ru/ptpu/20_1_97.htm">vasilievaa.narod.ru/ptpu/20_1_97.htm</a> <br>  4. <a href="http://nag.ru/articles/article/20124/novaya-tv-realnost.html">nag.ru/articles/article/20124/novaya-tv-realnost.html</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119361/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119361/</a></p>
