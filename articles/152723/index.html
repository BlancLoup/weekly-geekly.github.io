Desktop computer, laptop, tablet, smartphone, miniature player - not the point.  It is important for you that he perform the tasks that you give him - showed websites, videos, books, allowed to call, write messages, visit social networks, open and edit documents, send emails, edit videos and images, type in code, do calculations and so on - depends on the device itself.  This is the primary goal of the highest priority, it is impossible to argue with this - the device must do its job.  All the rest are secondary entities.

      In the concept of ‚Äúdoing my own thing‚Äù I put not only the formal execution of the task, but also the final quality of execution.  You can not watch movies on small screens.  You can not play games with brakes and lags.  You can not type any large texts on the nine-button keyboard with the key down.  This is almost always true, except in extreme cases that impose a restriction on the process of performing the task itself. <br><br>  There are tasks for which iron productivity is really needed, which directly depend on it;  if they are performed on the hardware weaker, their implementation will take several times longer.  This, for example, video editing, rendering three-dimensional graphics, the assembly of large programs, image processing, folding of proteins and hundreds and thousands of other processes.  Hats off to those who do it.  I respect their right to be demanding of performance. <br><br>  There are tasks that require quite a limited amount of resources and rarely crawl beyond the requirements.  This includes surfing the web, watching videos, editing text documents and spreadsheets, listening to music and the like.  Hats off to those who do it.  I respect their right to be demanding of high-quality performance of tasks. <br><br>  But it happens that marketers seize the mind.  Marketers successfully suggest that listening to music and reading books is not enough for it to be done well - it is <i>absolutely necessary</i> that as much processor time and RAM be available for this.  A real disaster will happen if you play Angry Birds on a device with a processor with a frequency of less than 1 GHz.  I don't care if the game works perfectly on three-year-old models - you can't do without an annual update of the device and long disputes, which is better - +6 to PPI or 200 megahertz on the processor. <br><br>  I was prompted to write this article by a comment line for one article.  Most accurately it can express a couple of comments: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ea6/705/053/ea6705053b5a71597d87d84fed54be2a.png"><br><br>  The author of a completely logical question received a pack of minuses.  People, what's wrong with you?  Did you forget what I said at the beginning?  The device should do its job, the rest is secondary.  What is the difference, how fast is the processor in the phone, if everything, absolutely everything is done perfectly on it?  I could understand this only in one case - if on the tablets and phones a statistically significant part of the audience performed complex calculations and generated content.  Fortunately, so few people do. <br><br>  The era of slow computers has long passed.  All everyday tasks are successfully performed by all modern devices, regardless of the filling.  I repeat - regardless of the filling.  Evil birds do not care, you have an iPhone, Nokia Lumia, Samsung Galaxy or someone else.  Similarly, this includes other games, movies and TV shows in 1080p, e-books, websites, music players and table editors. <br><br>  All tasks that are assigned to mobile devices are performed in full and excellent quality.  <i>Everything.</i> <br>  The rest is secondary entities. <br>  Includes device specifications.  What is the difference, how many operatives are there, if everything works as it should?  Remember Occam's razor: "you should not multiply things without necessity."  Why remember the characteristics of the device, if there is no need?  Why waste time and energy in disputes on the Internet about what is initially meaningless, why do you personally worry about it? <br><br>  I urge you - stop, we go wrong. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/152723/">https://habr.com/ru/post/152723/</a></p>
