  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Announcement of 2017 DotNext Piter: Jon Skeet in Petersburg</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>On May 19-20, the</b> eighth .NET conference <b>DotNext 2017 Piter</b> will be held in St. Petersburg.  Over four years, much has changed, the conference has grown both in the number of participants and in the level of speakers.  There is no need to go far for examples: in December 2016, 500 participants could listen to more than 20 reports in one day, 10 of which were preparing Microsoft MVP from around the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/992/2c8/766/9922c87660744315a9d6d83f7ed0c0ca.jpg"><br><br>  What have we done to make the next 2017 DotNext Piter even better?

    <ul><li>  It will <b>feature Jon Skeet</b> and other MVPs; </li><li>  The conference will be held within two days; </li><li>  Reports will be oriented towards <i><b>practical applicability</b></i> ; </li><li>  Perhaps we organize training Sasha Goldshtein; </li></ul><br>  Details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <b>Twice as much.</b>  <b>Or not at all?</b> </h2><br>  Yes, yes, this time the conference will be held in two days!  Last time we managed to fit 26 reports into a single-day program: four streams, short breaks, maximum reports density and discussion zones.  However, after the conference, it turned out that such a load by the end of the day had exploded the brain. <br><br>  There will be not 2 times more reports, but now, due to the <b>two-day format in three streams,</b> you will not only ‚Äúmiss fewer reports‚Äù - you will be able to visit more reports (which will be a little longer - 60 minutes per slot), you will be able to torment the speakers with questions in discussion zones, finally, can tritely take a pause if at some moment you feel that your brain starts to explode. <br><br><h2>  <b>Jon Skeet on DotNext</b> </h2><br><img align="left" width="250" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb3/620/08d/fb362008d61f4195b2fa6368fdcb4fff.jpeg">  Surely, you know who John (Yon) Skit is: one of the main <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/22656/jon-skeet">contributors to Stack Overflow</a> , author of <a href="http://csharpindepth.com/">C # in Depth</a> , developer at Google and 14-fold MVP.  For us, the opportunity to bring a speaker of this level is a big step in the world of .NET conferences.  An impressive list of merit can be supplemented with a couple of quotes: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWhen John‚Äôs code is not compiled, the compiler apologizes‚Äù</i> <br>  Dan dyer <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúJohn‚Äôs code does not follow design standards.</i>  <i>He is the standard. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  At DotNext 2017 Piter you will be able to listen to two presentations from John: <br><br><ul><li>  Keynout <b>"Back to Basics"</b> , dedicated to the relationship of the complex external world and data represented only by zeros and ones.  Admit it, because you also take numbers, text and date / time for granted?  Virtually any data model relies on these pillars.  The question is different, how is it that Stack Overflow is overflowing with questions about ‚Äúbroken‚Äù arithmetic?  In his report, John will try to tell what is wrong with our world, find the guilty and offer several ways to "not burn yourself" on this whole thing. <br><br></li><li>  <b>The changing state of immutability of C #</b> about what immutability is, what its advantages are and how it developed in C #.  In addition, we will talk about the various options for implementing the immutability of objects / states, their pros and cons (especially in cases where the language or platform does not encourage it), as well as what will happen to this concept in the future. </li></ul><br><h2>  <b>Speakers DotNext 2017 Piter</b> </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb6/0eb/0cc/bb60eb0cc7244e269a01c407d017c69d.jpg"><br><br>  However, the DotNext program is not the only one with Skitt.  The proven "fighters" of our .NET scene have already confirmed their participation: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Andrei <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/dreamwalker/" class="user_link">DreamWalker</a> Akinshin, JetBrains,</b> this time will distract from the arithmetic that takes place in the depths of the CLR, and will tell you how the virtual machine memory is arranged, which rakes can be stepped on and how best to avoid them. </li><li>  <b>Sasha <a href="https://twitter.com/goldshtn">@goldshtn</a> Goldshtein, Sela Group, the author of the book Pro .NET Performance</b> , will come up with "combat" stories from his many years of experience in working with performance, share the cheklistom of a performance engineer and tell you what to expect in the future from monitoring tools. </li></ul><br>  And someone has already confirmed his intention to make a report, but the program committee has not yet approved the final topics of the reports: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Marco Cecconi, Stack Overflow</b> , will continue his presentations made in Moscow and will talk about the tools and approaches that have made Stack Overflow as fast as it is now.  On this subject, by the way, he gave us a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/316854/"><b>detailed interview</b></a> . </li><li>  <b>Alex Thissen, Xpirit</b> , will talk about containerization features (Docker Swarm, Kubernetes and Mesos) in a Docker and .NET Core bundle.  It will be about working with cloud services and what is waiting for the platform in the future. </li><li>  <b>Filip W, Sonova</b> , will tell you how to write your own static Roslyn static code analyzer.  Strengthen coding conventions, find flaws in the code, reassign files in the project - "why not?"  The report is designed for developers who are responsible for the quality of the code in the teams. </li><li>  <b>Dmitry Soshnikov, Microsoft</b> , also confirmed his participation, and we look forward to the details - Dmitry always knew how to surprise both the program committee and the participants with their urgency and vivid reports! </li></ul><br><h2>  <b>Call for Papers</b> </h2><br>  If you have noticed that lately colleagues have turned to you for advice on working with some instrument, and you willingly tell or explain something to them;  if you have your own project that may be useful to the Russian .NET-community;  if you just love to share experience and you really have something to tell, <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/callforpapers/"><b>give us a report</b></a> ! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ccd/267/3b3/ccd2673b332d47d9b365838361ab97d1.jpg"><br><br>  Video recording of the report you made earlier will significantly speed up decision making by the program committee and increase your chances of speaking (having strong speeches is one of the important criteria that guides our PC). <br><br>  However, you should not be afraid of newcomers either: if your topic is fresh and interesting, we will do everything to hone the content of the report, the presentation technique, timings and presentation - in general, everything to prepare the perfect report with you, we even started A special blog heading maintained by the Roman <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/p0b0rchy/" class="user_link">p0b0rchy Fighting</a> . <br><br>  The main requirement: <b>your report should be useful to other developers</b> .  We are interested in reports on the following topics: <br><br><ul><li>  Developer Tools and Frameworks </li><li>  CLR internals </li><li>  CoreCLR </li><li>  Performance &amp; GC </li><li>  Cross-platform Development </li><li>  Desktop Applications Development </li><li>  Mobile Applications Development </li><li>  Automated Testing </li><li>  Dependency Management </li><li>  Build tools </li></ul><br><h2>  <b>Great training from Sasha Goldshtein</b> </h2><br>  In addition to the conference itself, on the date next to the conference, we plan to conduct a separate performance training for Sasha Goldstein for the whole day.  Help us understand which (or which?) Of the available topics to choose: <br><br><ul><li>  Production Performance and Troubleshooting of .NET Applications </li><li>  Making .NET Applications Faster with ETW </li><li>  Mastering .NET Performance Tools </li><li>  Mastering .NET Debugging with Visual Studio </li></ul><br>  Detailed descriptions of the trainings are available in a <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/TRNSVG8"><b>short survey-study</b></a> .  Participation in the training will be separate from the conference, so if you want to work with Sasha on specific issues and get under his leadership, you may be interested in just such an option. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be2/0d5/94a/be20d594a8b749178f51991c4422e222.jpg"><br><br><h2>  <b>check in</b> </h2><br>  As usual, the conference program can be monitored <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/"><b>on the conference website</b></a> , where you can also follow the list of confirmed speakers (to be honest, there is already something to see). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d74/2c3/812/d742c3812bb04a009f3ddac500bd8931.jpg"><br><br>  PPS If suddenly after reading the post you wanted to register - before February 1, we have an <a href="https://dotnext-piter.ru/registration"><b>early registration</b></a> .  And for those who are far from St. Petersburg, there is an online broadcast. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/319954/">https://habr.com/ru/post/319954/</a></p>
