  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Halfway": The five major news of the company ServiceNow for 2017</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The dynamic scope of service management implies constant change.  Therefore, it is not surprising that providers of appropriate software simply do not have the right to rest.  In this article, we summarize the more than six months' work of ServiceNow to mark the vectors of the development of the platform of the same name and to demonstrate the direction in which the industry is moving in 2017. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/it-guild/blog/334516/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/d1c/d4f/990/d1cd4f990806476cb59869fa897b3dbb.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/dafnecholet/5374200948/">Dafne Cholet</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i> <br><br><h2>  Acquisition of DxContinuum </h2><br>  ServiceNow began 2017 with a strategic step that set the development vector for the next half year.  In January, it became <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/servicenow-acquires-dxcontinuum-130000890.html">known</a> that the company is acquiring a DxContinuum machine learning startup to deepen the automation of service control elements.

      With the growth of the IoT industry, the manual way of processing, classifying and redirecting requests is not effective.  At McKinsey, it is <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/global-themes/digital-disruption/harnessing-automation-for-a-future-that-works">estimated</a> that 49% of the time spent on work can be automated, and this will lead to improved performance.  DxContinuum predictive models are designed to increase the efficiency of incoming requests from people and devices during the automatic categorization of ServiceNow. <br><br>  By applying DxContinuum machine learning algorithms to a unique data set of each client, the ServiceNow platform was able to determine the category of requests and redirect them to the responsible team, taking into account the associated risks.  Predictability and automation allows enterprises to significantly reduce costs and speed up problem resolution times, Dave Wright, Head of Strategic Planning at ServiceNow, then explained. <br><br>  January itself ended on a high note for ServiceNow.  After summarizing the annual and quarterly results, the company's shares <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/26/the-secret-sauce-behind-servicenows-52-growth-ceo.html">grew by</a> more than 3%.  The report featured data on the growth of service subscriptions by 52% per year.  ServiceNow Executive Director Frank Slootman then stated that this was the result of a successful platform strategy that he had been working on for many years.  According to him, all parts of the puzzle "finally fell into place." <br><br><h2>  Strategic partnership with IBM and MapAnything </h2><br>  In mid-February, it was <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ibm-and-servicenow-announce-global-strategic-partnership-300406682.html">announced</a> that ServiceNow was merging with IBM to introduce intelligent automation solutions for customers around the world.  The companies agreed to a multi-year strategic partnership, which again focused on improving the efficiency of their clients' business processes, especially representatives of Global 2000. <br><br>  As part of the new partnership, IBM and corporate customers will be able to use the ServiceNow platform to create business applications that automate processes in any department.  The solution is integrated into IBM technology services, including IBM Cognitive Business Solutions, Bluemix infrastructure, and IBM Cloud Orchestrator. <br><br>  As a result, enterprises have a unified platform for assigning and determining priorities, working together and solving major problems, as well as obtaining real-time performance information. <br><br>  Another event was announced on a smaller scale - in early February, ServiceNow <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbloomberg/2017/02/02/servicenow-invests-in-mapanything-in-platform-ecosystem-play/">made a</a> strategic investment in MapAnything, a location-based service management application developer.  ServiceNow's support of data acquisition from sensors and devices within IoT has become an important factor for MapAnything when making decisions. <br><br>  At the time of the announcement of the news on investment in MapAnything Dominic Phillips (Dominic Phillips), vice president of finance and corporate development at ServiceNow, said: ‚ÄúWe want to encourage third-party developers to create applications based on the platform, rather than just integrate with it.  ServiceNow‚Äôs investment strategy aims to grow and expand our solutions. ‚Äù <br><br><h2>  Leadership change </h2><br>  Despite the successes of ServiceNow under Frank Slutmane, at the end of February, former eBay CEO John Donahoe was <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-servicenow-ceo-idUSKBN1662B1">hired</a> to take his place.  Slutman remained on the company's board. <br><br>  Donahoe has 30 years of management experience and sits on the board of PayPal Holdings, Nike and Intel.  His assignment in ServiceNow is associated with the company's entry into new areas - operations and human resources management.  Donahoe said his policy would be in the interests of consumers. <br><br><h2>  ServiceNow relies on artificial intelligence </h2><br>  In May, after the <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/servicenow-reports-financial-results-first-200100667.html">publication of the</a> financial results of the first quarter, ServiceNow representatives announced new investments in the field of intelligent automation and artificial intelligence.  The company has <a href="https://www.servicenow.com/company/media/press-room/servicenow-acquires-qlue-and-invests-in-buildonme-to-deliver-intelligent-automation-to-everyday-enterprise-work.html">acquired a</a> virtual agent, Qlue.  With this investment, ServiceNow expands its request processing platform. <br><br>  The Qlue chat bot can answer frequently asked questions and is useful in diagnosing problems.  ServiceNow plans to use Qlue to assist in technical support, HR, customer service and in many other aspects.  Thanks to computer training and artificial intelligence, a virtual agent can solve problems, answer questions and take actions with high efficiency. <br><br>  In addition, a separate investment organization, ServiceNow Ventures, has announced an investment in BuildOnMe Corporation, which is launching applications with artificial intelligence based on Now Platform.  BuildOnMe has developed the first intelligent self-learning HR chat bot for the platform. <br><br>  Along with these events, the Intelligent Automation Engine solution was <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/3195331/systems-management/servicenow-taps-ai-to-automate-everyday-workflows.html">announced</a> at the Knowledge Conference in Orlando at ServiceNow.  It brings enhanced machine learning to the Now Platform to automate business processes to help customers prevent failures, redirect requests, and predict and evaluate the effectiveness of the IT department.  Machine learning capabilities will be implemented in ServiceNow cloud services.  The algorithms of Intelligent Automation Engine are based on technologies acquired by DxContinuum. <br><br><h2>  Running jakarta </h2><br>  In July, ServiceNow <a href="https://community.servicenow.com/docs/DOC-7398">opened</a> access to a new version of its platform - Jakarta.  Along with it, customers receive 7 new applications and more than 30 major improvements. <br><br>  The list of the most significant changes includes the debut of the Intelligent Automation Engine with machine learning and predictive models inherited from DxContinuum.  In addition, Jakarta brings tools such as the Instance Security Dashboard, a dashboard for collecting and processing large amounts of MetricBase data, into the platform. <br><br>  From the point of view of service management, Jakarta opens access to new KPIs, tools for conducting surveys and managing SLAs. <br><br>  So, for the past 7 months of 2017, ServiceNow has gone the way of planning to deepen process automation through machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as to strengthen the approach to product development, taking into account the wishes of customers. <br><br><h5>  About DxContinuum </h5><br>  DxContinuum is a machine learning technology developer and leader in predictive analytics for companies creating intuitive and efficient solutions. <br><br><h5>  About MapAnything </h5><br>  MapAnything is a productivity-enhancing platform that helps sales, service, and marketing departments increase revenue to optimize workflows based on geolocation services. <br><br><h5>  About BuildOnMe </h5><br>  BuildOnMe is a manufacturer of products that take advantage of artificial intelligence and IBM Watson to enhance ServiceNow cloud applications. <br><br>  PS What else do we write about in our blog?
