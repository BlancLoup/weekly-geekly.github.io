In part, this statement holds true for the IT world.  In confirmation of this, we present the Fujitsu pre-New Year retrospective. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/aa1/340/527/aa1340527fd7d9056413549c843a87aa.png"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Perhaps the most noticeable for users was the flourishing of ultrabooks. <br>  Now thin compact laptops weighing about a kilogram have become an indispensable model in the range of manufacturers.  However, as an independent brand, ultrabooks have appeared on the market only since 2011, while Fujitsu released compact laptops LIFEBOOK of the P and Q series in the early 2000s.  Then models weighing about 1 kg were made with a screen diagonal of 10.6-inches, but these are subnotebooks, not netbooks.  Models LIFEBOOK P had a performance comparable to conventional laptops and a surprisingly comfortable keyboard.

But in 2010 Fujitsu introduced color electronic ink displays, ready for industrial production. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/683/b81/ec1/683b81ec1b2ee8c8381cb85a69af92e7.jpg"><br>  <i>Fujitsu Next Generation Color e-paper Module</i> <br><br>  Now with touch screens in mobile devices under Windows 8 you will not surprise anyone, but in 1993 the first tablets based on the Microsoft platform appeared.  Fujitsu experimented with touchscreens on its own and had the corresponding models in the LIFEBOOK series of B, T and STYLISTIC business notebooks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/071/06e/85d/07106e85d84138b795223e7dcc3b5934.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc6/2de/1f1/cc62de1f1fb6aebe245a9bea14f211d2.jpg"><br>  <i>Fujitsu LIFEBOOK B Series</i> <br><br>  Be proud of your 4 TB hard drive?  Meanwhile, in 2009, Fujitsu announced CentricStor FS and VT systems with support for the total storage capacity of more than 1 petabyte of memory (1024 Terabytes).  Then such volumes in one system seemed redundant and it was assumed that the company that bought them would lease (the term clouds only gained popularity).  But by the end of 2012, the top storage system (DSS) has a volume of 20 Pbytes already and is used by SAP.  In addition, there are already about 20 storage systems with a capacity of more than 10 Pbytes installed in the world, and there are hundreds of companies that need a capacity of more than 1 Pbyte!  The main consumer of systems with such a large capacity were cans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/455/613/965/4556139651d02d0ab0e4f55c11cd04e1.jpg"><br>  <i>Fujitsu CentricStor</i> <br><br>  Fujitsu products can be compared with an iceberg: products that we know well are only a small part.  For example, Japanese engineers lay the ocean fiber optic cables and optical data transmission systems necessary for the smooth operation of the Internet.  These cables now transmit 99% of the information between continents, as satellite channels are still expensive.  At the moment, the length of the cables laid by Fujitsu, is about 90,000 km - they could wind the Cross to the Cross and still be left. <br>  Not only cables, but also relay stations are located at a depth of up to 8000 meters and the first systems have been working without interruption for 40 years. <br><br>  Do you have a car?  Does it have displays?  If yes, then most likely it has Fujitsu equipment.  The company is a leader in the production of video controllers for dashboards, embedded navigation systems, indicators projected on the windshield, and multimedia systems for rear passengers.  Fujitsu has created the world's first controller for high-definition video, aimed at use in the internal automotive network.  It also produces CAN microcontrollers that provide important vehicle functions.  Fujitsu has been in the automotive industry for 35 years. <br><br>  In Japan and China, over 5 million Fujitsu phones are sold annually.  In addition, the company supports LTE infrastructure for DoCoMo 4G in Japan, and Fujitsu Ethernet networks are used by Verizon and the London Stock Exchange.  In 2012, Fujitsu service networks registered one call every two seconds and more than 50 Pbytes of data passed through them. <br><br>  Happy New Year, colleagues! <br> <a href="http://ru.fujitsu.com/rl/xmas/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/47b/db8/bf5/47bdb8bf57a478248a7b7e853df72809.png"></a> <br>  PS: the picture is clickable :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164273/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164273/</a></p>
