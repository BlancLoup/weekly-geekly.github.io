And then I finally realized that the time had come when it was easier to take a budget tablet. <br>  Naturally, the first thing I went to AliExpress, hoping to order from there.  But then I saw that tablets with a more or less normal screen cost the same 3000-4000.  Plus the month of delivery, plus the inability to see this screen live and evaluate whether it is more or less realistic.  I turned my attention to the local market and saw it.  Megaphone Login 3. 1990 rubles plus a mandatory package of unlimited Internet for three months for 700 rubles, a total of 2690. <br><br>  Considering that I had to use its predecessor before, Megaphone Login 2 (now almost a year working as an Internet window for mom), I wondered how much the extra-budget tablets had changed during that time.  Moreover, the manufacturer is the same - Foxda.  Now I can not share the information received from communication with the device. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8bf/643/dbe/8bf643dbea014617893008a398aae0d8.jpg">

      I noticed that for some reason reviews are made to begin with packaging.  I still do not understand to whom this may be interesting, but, apparently, these are the traditions and not for me to change them.  Printing and box material of the third "Login" is somehow more solid than the second.  But the main difference is that now the technical characteristics are printed in large print on the package, and not shyly hidden somewhere in the depths. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/105/fec/376/105fec37661c436abce336a4d882e9ef.jpg"><br><br>  Only the thickness has changed.  The new tablet, following the general trends, has become thinner than the previous one, despite the fact that the battery capacity was increased from 3000 to 3500 mAh.  In addition to the thickness, the tablets visually differ from the back: the Login 3 has a metal back cover (for an ultra-budget tablet, this is about the effect of metal on the price of devices) and a camera module, slightly bulging, unlike its predecessor. <br><br>  The display in size and resolution remained exactly the same: 7 ", 1024 * 600.  But these are absolutely two different displays! <br>  To understand, you just need to see what stood at Login 2. There were just no viewing angles.  Slightly turned - everything, the colors have become very different.  For someone who loves to read while lying to me - very critical.  It was one of the two main drawbacks of the device. <br>  On Login 3 is a normal, human display, you can twist as you like.  IPS, not TN.  Of the shortcomings, only grain remains, not HD.  But it does not interfere with reading: the eyes no longer get tired. <br>  What we liked - the display is covered with a protective film without inscriptions, which you can not remove.  I scratched the Login 2 tablet at one time, wearing it without a case in a bag with a metal "zipper", therefore it is relevant.  Once there is no protective glass, only the film remains. <br><br>  What was the second drawback of the previous tablet?  The size of the RAM.  512 MB for Android is not serious already.  Applications are now such monsters that launched the browser, opened two pages and hello brakes.  Fortunately, in Login 3 this deficiency was corrected: now there is enough memory of gigabytes, which, in my opinion, is enough for the tasks assigned to the state employees. <br><br>  Another of the notable innovations: the main camera was 3.2 megapixels, instead of 2 megapixels at Login 2. But still without autofocus.  It became more convenient to remove any texts, but artistry, of course, should not be expected.  The front camera is still 0.3 megapixel, the only thing that has changed is now more logical: from the top, not from the bottom. <br>  The processor has become a little faster, but it has not changed in principle.  Inside the same dual-core Qualcomm Snapdragon, but no longer gigahertz S4 Play MSM8225, but 1.2 gigahertz MSM8210.  Visually, the interface became a bit smoother, but, as it seemed to me, the increased volume of RAM and the new OS played a major role in this.  The operating system is really new - Anrdoid 4.4.4.  In Login 2 was Anroid 4.1.2. <br>  Wireless modules have not changed, the same GSM, 3G, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth.  The difference is only in 3G speed - earlier it was limited to 7.2 Mbit / s, now it has risen to 21.1 Mbit / s.  As I understand it, due to the number of simultaneously used slots. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b6/655/6e9/1b66556e96cd491687369975a93fc273.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7d/d5e/132/a7dd5e1328b04a83ae615e6c38e40db5.png"><br><br>  It makes no sense to describe the shell, the most common, everything can be seen in the screenshots that were made immediately after opening the box.  The kit comes with several pre-installed applications, among which, of course, several branded "Megafonovskiy".  From the cameramen, MegaDisk (such as Dropbox, but with free traffic), MegaFon-Visa (virtual card tied to the balance - convenient for shopping in the Market), and ‚ÄúWatch +‚Äù (online TV) seemed really interesting. <br>  Of the non-operator ones, there is a ‚ÄúYandex Browser‚Äù (I like the version for the desktop, but for Android, the sensation of dampness doesn‚Äôt leave), Kaspersky Internet Security (for the inexperienced - well, let it be) and Clean Master (I doubt it really is needed).  I just want to write that thousands of applications on Android, and especially Internet access is already prepaid, so there‚Äôs no need to clutter up the tablet in advance.  But I understand perfectly well that this is also one of the ways to reduce the price of a device, so I forgive for this segment. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/767/d30/3bc/767d303bc60940b5af4dc2a03b426732.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/67a/8ab/3f1/67a8ab3f14b641c9a0281e43d69c2e59.png"><br><br>  Which of all this can be concluded?  On the usefulness of the device of this class do yourself, based on their personal preferences and requirements.  I saw too many different points of view on the previous Login to impose something on someone. <br>  But progress is obvious.  In addition to the commonly observed top segment, this is strongly noticeable in the extra budgetary segment.  Of course, here and there extremes.  The device of the same manufacturer, without changing the price, made a noticeable step forward in comparison with the predecessor.  I wonder if the pace will not slow down next year, because there is something to improve.  At least the screen resolution, for example. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e45/57b/e6e/e4557be6ec9c483cb74fc52c20e813fd.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/361869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/361869/</a></p>
