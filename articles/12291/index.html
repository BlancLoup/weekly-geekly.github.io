  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of traffic compression programs: Traffic Compressor and Toonel</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>General information about traffic compression.</strong> <br>  Using programs to compress traffic saves money spent on the Internet and, sometimes, speeds up the loading of pages by reducing the size of the transmitted data stream. <br>  The principle of operation of programs of this type is simple: a program is installed on the client‚Äôs computer that intercepts requests from other programs to connect and sends them to a special server.  After processing and receiving the response, the server transmits the requested data to the client‚Äôs computer in compressed form, the client‚Äôs program unpacks it and sends it to the program that made the request. <br>  Traffic compression reaches 25% - 80%. <br>  The following traffic is well compressed: web pages, scripts (JavaScript / VBScript), CSS files, text files, any e-mail messages received via POP3 or IMAP4 protocols, both with and without attached files (compressed attached files ( such as ZIP, MP3, JPEG, GIF and others) can be reduced in size by 25% -30%), messaging traffic: ICQ, Windows Messenger, AIM, Yahoo!  Messenger, Jabber, Gadu-Gadu, IRC, Usenet (News) traffic. <br>  Such traffic, as: images, Flash videos, ActiveX, Java applets, ZIP, EXE, MP3 and other compressed files, pages compressed by the websites themselves using gzip, protocols: FTP, HTTPS, SMTP, UDP, files and voice messages transmitted through messaging programs, streaming video and audio. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Specific programs that implement traffic compression. <br>  <strong>Traffic compressor</strong> <br>  Program website: <a href="http://www.tcompressor.ru/">http://www.tcompressor.ru/</a> <br>  Developed by Traflabs LLC.  After installing the program, you must register for free on the site.  It is possible to use one account on no more than two computers.  There is for the type of accounts: paid and free. <br>  Free use of the program implies some limitations in using the service: <br>  - Connection to the server with a delay (the delay depends on the number of users connected to the servers at the moment); <br>  - The connection to the server is broken after downloading several megabytes of traffic (5-10 MB) via TrafficCompressor <br>  (after disconnection, the program re-enters the queue to connect to the server). <br>  - Saving incoming traffic is 20% -25% lower than with a paid subscription. <br>  Paid mode eliminates all these limitations. <br>  Pros: <br>  1. Automatic detection of programs for which traffic compression is possible. <br>  2. Simplicity and clarity of program settings. <br>  Minuses: <br>  1. A limited list of protocols for which compression is possible. <br>  2. The solution is presented only for the Windows platform. <br>  3. With free use, a delay in the activation of traffic compression is possible. <br>  Personal opinion: <br>  I have been using the program since October 2006.  Initially, free of charge, in February paid a subscription for six months.  For all the time, more than 1GB was saved (despite the fact that I use GPRS internet :).  The quality of service is average.  Sometimes it happens that the Internet connection is in order, but the data is not transmitted, after the program is deactivated everything starts to work, but without compression, respectively.  After some time the server is stabilized. <br>  It is amusing that when using the program on those sites where there is a definition of the user's country by IP, I am not determined by the Russian user.  Google in particular constantly invites me to switch to Google UK. <br>  Not without trouble.  Some sites are not quite workable when using traffic compressor.  In particular, again the same, where the user's IP is constantly checked, for security purposes (for example, as hosting Ucoz). <br>  <strong>Toonel</strong> <br>  Program website: <a href="http://toonel.net/">http://toonel.net</a> <br>  The program is supported by the team of the site toonel.net (unfortunately did not find any mention of the company).  The program has java implementation.  Accordingly, it can work on any platform that supports java. <br>  The program is completely free for personal use.  About restrictions of use it is not told anywhere, but, IMHO, I think that compression naturally will not work if all servers of the program are occupied. <br>  Pros: <br>  1. Multiplatform.  Windows, Linux, Mac, Pocket PC, Symbian are supported, alpha version is available for J2ME. <br>  2. Ability to customize for any program that can work through a proxy. <br>  3. It is possible to compress traffic transmitted over a secure connection. <br>  Minuses: <br>  1. The complexity of the configuration. <br>  Personal opinion: <br>  The program is possible and good.  But I am not ready yet to manually configure all the programs (especially some of them do not provide such an opportunity) to use Tunel. </div>
