This is the conclusion <a href="http://www.envirotech-online.com/news/business-news/44/breaking_news/online_payments_save_one-tenth_of_a_tree_per_year/34067/">reached by</a> Environmental Technology analysts.  We at <a href="http://payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">PayOnline</a> , a company that has been engaged in automating online payments for 7 years, fully share this point of view and want to share some statistics in this post. <br><br>  According to rough estimates, 7.3 million hectares of forest annually disappear from human hands, which is comparable to approximately 36 football fields disappearing in a minute.  In addition, because of this, almost 12% of the annual carbon dioxide emissions occur, which tells us that aggressive destruction of the forest destroys the natural flora and fauna.  The world is well aware of the need to reduce the rate of deforestation, organizing many campaigns aimed at reducing the demand for wood everywhere.  Some of the steps are obvious, such as recycling and reusing paper as much as possible.  However, other, more creative approaches are also surprising in their effectiveness.  For example, switching to one person‚Äôs online payments can save a tenth of a tree in a year! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Electronic payments and the environment </h3><br>  According to environmentalists, the transition to electronic payments is recognized as one of the most undervalued "green" initiatives of the last decade.  Just by switching from paying bills using paper checks, invoices and using envelopes to online payment systems, one person can save a whole tree for ten years. <br><br>  At a time when most pro-eco campaigns require a lot of effort and resources to implement them, online payments are easy.  Almost all services and products can now be purchased via the Internet, which means that buyers have the opportunity to receive an invoice and pay it in just a couple of clicks.  From credit cards to mobile devices, the Internet makes it easy to accept online payments to almost any business.  Some of them even offer discounts and privileges to those who make payments online.

      In addition to saving the environment, switching to online payments will allow the consumer to save time and money.  Instead of filling out receipts, opening envelopes with invoices, buying stamps and going to post offices, ATMs and terminals, making an online payment quickly, for free and 100% safe. <br><br>  For the online business, the system also provides significant privileges, in addition to environmental responsibility.  Studies have shown that there is a direct link between e-invoicing and customer satisfaction and loyalty.  About how much money you can save on paper, printing, shipping and couriers, you can not mention. <br><br>  Unfortunately, the benefits from the point of view of ecology and convenience have not yet been appreciated by everyone.  Marketplace.org survey showed that in 2013 only 50% of consumers paid for purchases online.  The US Environmental Protection Agency claims that if every consumer tried to switch to online payments, the world could save up to 44 tons of paper per year!  For each household, this is approximately 3 kilograms of paper, 77 kg.  greenhouse gas emissions and, of course, a tenth of the tree!  This suggests that the world is actively progressing.  The US National Pay It Green Alliance is supported by thousands of corporations, including Bank of America, Federal Reserve Banks and AT &amp; T, the largest telecommunications company.  With the growing number of consumers and businesses choosing online payments, paper money will be out of circulation. <br><br>  <i>If you want to start accepting payments online on your website, <a href="http://payonline.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dreferral%26utm_campaign%3Dwebpayments-main">please contact</a> our experts to help you with this.</i>  <i>Subscribe to our <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/payonline/">corporate blog</a> , there is still a lot of interesting things ahead.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297244/</a></p>
