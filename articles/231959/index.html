      Quite often I see statements like ‚Äúa real programmer, one who has insights, inspiration, burning work!‚Äù On Habre. What is interesting is that sometimes experienced individuals write.  I propose to conduct a vote in order to estimate what percentage of which programmers are zahabren on this site. <br><br>  So. <br><br>  1. Are you a freelance artist if you think that: <br>  - the programmer himself must set tasks;  creativity and its freedom must be one hundred percent! <br>  - it is necessary to burn at work, to program literally, having forgotten about everything. <br>  - you need to think about the project and outside of work, sometimes even at night in a dream. <br>  - money is not so important, it is important to have a feeling of happiness at work, at least sometimes, when you find a non-obvious solution, a difficult bug, etc. <br><br>  Although, as an option, it is not excluded that, as a result, ‚Äúa portrait painter of idle wandering tourists on the Old Arbat‚Äù may turn out to be earning his bread under the open sky, because nobody needs your ingenious canvases. <br><br>  2. You are a gzhel decorator (or house architect, if you wish), if you think that: <br>  - there is no freedom to choose a task, and creativity is also very limited, although there is a certain field for maneuver / expression. <br>  - should set tasks should bosses or clients, but not to get involved in the solution of the problem, and serve as a purely external customer. <br>  - the choice of the solution to the problem may be limited to the libraries used, resources, hardware, language, etc. <br>  - money and interesting tasks are related to you as 50/50. <br><br>  But sometimes you can also dream with sadness: oh, if I had complete freedom, I would have SUCHED it, I would have SUCH it! .. <br><br>  3. Are you a painter (but professional) if you think that: <br>  - there is no freedom to choose a task, but why is there, even almost all typical tasks and creativity are very few here. <br>  - the authorities or clients should set tasks, and they can get involved in solving the problem, especially the authorities, for various reasons. <br>  - Yes, what is there, even colleagues can fit into your decision. <br>  - Your decisions are severely limited by all possible frameworks, means, guidelines.  documents, etc.  etc.  And this is life, but you can‚Äôt argue against it. <br>  - even typical tasks can be done well or crookedly and you are satisfied with the fact that you are doing them well, professionally (satisfaction, but not happiness and delight). <br>  - you just work at work, for money, but even in typical tasks there are a lot of interesting things to keep your cheekbones from boredom. <br><br>  There are many things to do: get depressed, depressed, kill apsten.  Or live yourself and live.  And with a grin look at the "free" and their oohs and ahs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/231959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/231959/</a></p>
