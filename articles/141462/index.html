So I managed to get into the box with waste paper.  It is a pity that I can not convey the expression of my face when I found the magazine "Crocodile" for June 1985 (No. 17).  Due to the fact that the magazine was published long before my birth, I found many funny things in it (at least they now seem so). <br><br>  But, in particular, I was pleased with the article ‚ÄúBet on a Punched Card‚Äù by A.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  My friend computer </h4><br><br>  Throwing electronics into children's masses was called Crocodile last year (see A. Moralevich‚Äôs ‚ÄúLove of Electricity‚Äù in No. 17).  The sooner we introduce our curious child to the products of the electronics industry, the faster the pace of scientific and technical progress in the country, when today's children become adults and enter the workshops and laboratories. <br><br>  In last year's speech, attention was paid mainly to electronic toys.  The topic of the current study of the same author is a school computer, achievements and problems of school computerization. <br><br>  And even though it‚Äôs good that schoolchildren in this building (according to the methodological developments of the institute-chef, gorono and rono: safety considerations and maintaining concentration) are strictly forbidden, welcoming any deputations and commissions, getting up from the tables with computer equipment. <br><br>  *** <br><br>  How far are the seventies from us, but here it is: the list of the mass working professions of those years did not contain anything related to computers.  Ten years have passed - and this list is boundless, and its growth is avalanche-like.  And the state‚Äôs technical policy for the future is defined very clearly: the creation of an automated workplace (computer-based workstations) in all branches of labor activity.  Such a workplace will destroy the monotony of labor, routine production activities.  The computer will release the human brain for a truly creative work, providing without delay, the most intricate information right now.  And all this in the foreseeable future.  Because a silent computer, by no means as noticeable as, say, an airbus in the sky, worked quietly on its own ‚Äî and by now, industry and territorial computing centers on all counts ‚Äî profits, costs, services ‚Äî go head to head with such giants like transportation and communications.  And again, there is no escape: computer language skills are immutable and will soon become an integral part of the culture of the population.  And the questionnaire graph about a person‚Äôs knowledge of languages ‚Äã‚Äãwill look like this: ‚ÄúI speak Udmurt, Russian, German, Fortran and BASIC‚Äù.  It is also known that a significant part of the adult population will be taught by the computer languages ‚Äã‚Äãof BASIC, FORTRAN, ALGOL, and others, as well as the basics of computer wisdom.  Citizens, we can‚Äôt go anywhere, and let us give in to this: the eggs will fruitfully teach both the chicken, and others like it and the rooster. <br><br>  However, the egg for its educational activities must create the prerequisites.  It is known who should create them, but what has been done over the past year by ministries and departments for the computerization of school and childhood?  And here's what: as before, unfamiliar to each other, members of the crew lead an unfamiliar ship in an unfamiliar ship and crew. <br><br>  Before computerization, already quite a while, there was a game industrialization of childhood.  But, child, there are such cutting machines in the mines, and icebreakers in the seas.  Therefore, preparing you for entry into the world of adults, we will release for you models of the cut-in combine harvester and icebreaker.  And since you are a child and you cannot penetrate into subtleties, we will make an ice-breaker from a one-piece chock, without a mass of inherent details in life.  But ‚Äî so that you guys will like it!  - on board the ice-breaker a little darling is drawn, holds in its paw carrot-carrots, which it conducts and conducts an orchestra of merry toads and crickets. <br><br>  And the analogy is alive and alive in the encroachments of releasing a children's computer from a stray e-chock, and a little darling on its barrel. <br><br>  Although all the information collected by pedagogy and science is fiercely against the little darling, against the computer-lisping industry with children.  Children wonder and immediately fit into the computer.  Fifth graders, even some first graders <br><br>  forced to grow dumb with the delight of experienced programmers super-large computers.  Arriving in Novosibirsk at the Olympiad of young programmers, seven guys from uchkombinat number 1, owning international programming languages ‚Äã‚ÄãFortran, BASIC and Algol, were informed that the competition will be held in a little-known language "rapier", which Muscovites never knew, and the Novosibirsk residents studied rapier "three years.  What's next?  Confusion with returning home?  No, in three days the language was mastered, seven began to compete. <br><br>  No need to draw a computer bunny! <br><br>  And what is the situation of affairs? <br><br>  ‚ÄúA psychologist! ‚ÄîIs heard from everywhere. ‚Äî The road to the design bureau and the design bureau of an engineering psychologist.‚Äù  The engineer either computer-sniffs with the children, or hits hard technical methods that are inaccessible to the student.  Without a fellowship with an engineering psychologist, the engineer will not create anything worthwhile, although to this day the engineer prevents the psychologist on an equal basis with him from his staff and participating in the development.  A truly computer-friendly engineer cannot create.  Dry engineering thinking gives, so to speak, a hard hockey stopper, but rhythmic gymnastics is needed!  Dear psychologist at the school computer production! <br><br>  And there is no road, not even stitches.  After all, how many bright psychological heads should be involved in the development of small school-binding computers in the USSR Ministry of Electronic Industry!  And how many are there?  And there is no one. <br><br>  There is no leader, there is no centralization, there is no brain trust, but there is only a separate artel of artels on semi-public principles. <br><br>  An optimistic exclamation will break the sadness of these paragraphs: <br><br>  - A "Agat"?  Did you forget about him? <br><br>  Yes, indeed, a small, school-oriented computer "Agat".  Manufacturers and designers beat themselves in the chest, vowing to overrun with this apparatus power.  In the jacket to the plumber you will open the door, and he is already in a padded jacket: I‚Äôm saying, I‚Äôm just coming to you, Agat figured it out ‚Äî you had a mixer poured in. <br><br>  So, "Agat".  But, looking at the trains on the railways, you install: it‚Äôs not all of them, not Agat, that the trains are loaded.  Twenty things of such priborchik-yes, there is in Novosibirsk.  Sometimes even more than half of them work. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe whole world,‚Äù said TP Kravchuk, director of the Uchkombinat No. 1, ‚Äúis now working on computer friendliness.‚Äù  A friendly computer recognizes the voice of its permanent operator and turns on that voice.  He says to his operator: ‚ÄúDo not be nervous, it‚Äôs not we who broke the wood.  You're doing great, and I broke the wood.  Come again, I can take everything into account and correct. ‚Äù  Friendly computer is extremely resistant to erroneous actions of a novice operator.  Moreover, it adapts to the most typical errors and corrects them.  Friendly computer cherishes the mood and operability of the operator.  This is a friendly computer, whereas ‚ÄúAgat‚Äù is still difficult to call such.  After twenty-five minutes of work on Agate, even aces-tenth pupils of Uchkombinat No. 1, accustomed to ‚Äúadult‚Äù machines, have tears, eye inflammation and headaches. <br><br>  And now, moving away from the building a few ponderous architecture, I want to summarize what we have. <br><br>  Centralization of research on the school computer is?  No, not organized. <br><br>  As such, apart from the fact that it was created by a group of enthusiasts at the MSU chemical department, is there a promising apparatus?  Not. <br><br>  Is there a staff of engineering psychologists for small computers in producing ministries?  No, take bayonets, contrive without! <br><br>  Powerful groups of designers on school computer topics in the producing ministries?  Not. <br><br>  But what happens if a computer rushes into a school ‚Äî who will repair it?  Who is repairing you, Tatyana Petrovna? <br><br>  - We, on our own, have enough skills.  Well, if it is a difficult case, then our students have very responsive parents.  And if at all an extreme case, then reliable chefs. <br><br>  But, I asked the director of the Uchkombinat No. 1, for example, Syktyvkar.  And there are no such colossi on its territory, as in the Oktyabrsky district of Moscow, where schoolchildren from school No.1, Moscow State University, the Institute of Steel and Alloys, the Main Computing Center of the USSR State Standard, the Moscow Institute of National Economy, the Institute of Computer Science of the USSR Academy of Sciences, practice on large computers. , gentle institute-chef?  How to be with repairs in schools of Syktyvkar, Molodechno, Elabugi? <br><br>  ‚ÄúA door recently opened for me ...‚Äù said Tatyana Petrovna. <br><br>  A door recently opened to her, and the director gritted her teeth habitually: a lot of work, and again brought someone. <br><br>  Brought three strict double-breasted men. <br><br>  ‚ÄúDo not be alarmed, we are not an excursion or a deputation,‚Äù said the men. ‚ÄúWe are responsible officers of the Central Statistical Board of the USSR.  We came to explore.  You must know everything about high school computerization.  Thousands of computers will be installed in schools, and who will repair them?  Legally, this has not been laid on anyone yet, and we have been judged by the USSR CSO: what if we ... Geographically throughout the country, our services and our repair base are everywhere. <br><br>  Then I told Tatyana Kravchuk: <br><br>  - Incredible!  Legally, they were not pinned anything, and the CSB is exploring how to hang a weight on your neck.  What is this - a nobility?  Love to school?  Desire to provide the CSB of the USSR with a new item of income?  Guardianship about the future of the country and its youth? <br><br>  ‚ÄúI will reduce,‚Äù said Tatyana Petrovna, ‚Äúall the questions‚Äú what is this? ‚ÄùIn one answer: this is a case of a state approach. <br><br>  So, it will be to repair someone, it would be that. <br><br>  Well, and the basis of the foundations, the cornerstone ‚Äî the school textbook on computer informatics, which since September for the first time in the history of our pedagogy should be taught from the eighth grades, does it exist? <br><br>  Still missing.  True, the manuscript of two co-authors went around Moscow, the respect for which grew one and a half times wider than the criticism for it.  And somehow, though academic, the Academicians spoke out very reservedly about the manuscript.  Somehow, perhaps, is negative.  One membercore went further, spoke in the sense that the book is, of course, a fountain, but park-cultural, not Bakhchisarai, and if you make very substantial improvements, then ... <br><br>  And here a terrible pedagogical miscalculation was made Tatiana Petrovna Kravchuk.  And for this she was executed for a long time.  Exactly: having sealed the names of the co-authors on the manuscript title, the director gave the manuscript to three schoolchildren, middle ones, not informers of computer science, - this is the intended textbook for the next year.  Read, you need to know your opinion ... <br><br>  Publishers who need honest, uncompromising, deep and operational reviewers, to whom Plato is a friend, but the truth is more precious, can get from me the addresses and surnames of these students.  Their review was publicized, the textbook was not accepted for publication.  And the new textbook?  The combined powerful team of highly competent people under the auspices of a ministry, state, so to speak, is writing a new one?  Indeed, for tens of millions of children! <br><br>  No, it does not compose. <br><br>  But still, hopefully, a tolerable textbook for schoolchildren will be kept on schedule by someone‚Äôs efforts.  A textbook for many thousands of computer science teachers?  This is also an unprecedented case for teachers. <br><br>  About this textbook nothing is known at all.  Although, perhaps, having retired to some skete, to the screech of corncrakes and have a drink, someone of civilian motives writes. <br><br>  And illustrative manuals for schools in the country?  Does anyone work on them to publish in the mass circulation the smartest posters, booklets and diagrams? <br><br>  There is no such research either.  But I think the posters are not the most disastrous, because I have a driver's license, for example, and in a driving school, in desperate years ago, the teacher told us this: <br><br>  - Guys!  We will pass the ZIS-5 car, but there are no posters on it at the driving school.  Here I got a colorful table "Cutting the carcass of a sheep".  Imagination you have a young, rich, so that we will pass the ZIS-5 on the sheep. <br><br>  And we studied the rear axle of the ZIS-5 through the sacral section of the ram, and no one, surely, would argue with me that there is no, they say, nothing in common between the sheep's tail and the differential in the rear axle ... <br><br>  So it is today.  And this is what the founding fathers of uchkombinat No. 1, the Director of the Institute of Informatics of the USSR Academy of Sciences Academician B.N. Naumov, and the Director of the Institute of Electronic Control Machines of the USSR Ministry of Instrument Engineering, Automation and Control Systems of the USSR, say about the productive dialogue ‚ÄúSchoolboy ‚Äî Computer‚Äù : <br><br>  - It is necessary to look for all the answers on the computerization of the school at the control of the car with the children, and not during the "general theoretical" discussions.  Here is the task of a teacher working in this new field. <br><br>  Here everything is fair, but it says only about teachers.  And seven or eight Allied Ministers, plus the leading designers of their ministries, would look very attractive along with them and the children.  Behind the consoles of massive efficient school computers, finally created by our ministries.  Or at least one ministry, but strictly appointed by the. <br><br>  After all, Timur, as you know, was famous for his team, and what should we hope for, say, the Timur school computer that has been developed for a very long time, if the whole team is with him, which is ridiculous - One green engineer and one laboratory assistant?  Of course, they are thinking, looking for bright technical solutions within their salaries. <br><br>  But I want to say very loudly, almost breaking into a cry, addressing by no means only to the low-power team of the emerging ‚ÄúTimur‚Äù: <br>  - Citizens!  Stop searching, show the finds! <br><br>  PS So many years have passed, and how much has changed? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141462/</a></p>
