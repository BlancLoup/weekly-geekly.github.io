      1. Fucking looks. <br>  2. It is electro-great. <br>  3. This is a clever electro-great which very competently helps pedal. <br>  4. And he has a computer and a connection to the smartphone. <br><br>  Let's get started <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The pedals will have to twist.  It will be very easy but you will have to turn it.  There is no engine power button on this model, however there is an awesome help system and it is perfectly balanced.  In general, I am skeptical about all sorts of clever helpers and other ‚Äúintelligences‚Äù, but here everything is done <b>fucking awesome</b> ! <br><br>  On the rear axle, there is a hall sensor, which <u>very accurately and quickly</u> determines with what force the pedal is depressed, and very accurately dispenses the help with an electric burden.  That is, there are no extra stupid jerks that have to be braked, there are no problems with starting up the hill, like in other electric bicycles where the electronics do not track the force of pressing, but simply watch the pedals spin or not.  You just drive very easy and no problems.  In addition to this, you can choose how much the motor should help you, there are 3 degrees of help + motor shutdown. <br><br>  I confess there were thoughts to put a button to turn on the engine, but after the first trips, these plans went into the most indefinite box as "you could do it, but even so, it's good." <br><br>  If anyone advises how this is done easily and simply will be grateful. <br><br>  The on-board computer is almost entirely in Chinese, and so far there are no ways to Russify it or angologize it.  However, he is primitive enough to remember where things are, pointing the Google interpreter‚Äôs camera a couple of times at it or watching a couple of videos on YouTube.  He also collects statistics in his memory and then can download it into the application when you perform Bluetooth pairing with the phone. <br><br>  Using the application updates the firmware of the bike.  When you first connect, you will be asked to install an international version on it, where the maximum speed will increase to 25 km / h against the initial 20 km / h for the Chinese version.  It will be necessary on the on-board computer to press the top button to confirm the update and wait about 5 minutes until the firmware is installed.  Also, the application can be used as a computer screen, there is displayed in real time speed, and other parameters of the trip.  It also collects statistics on all trips. <br><br>  A cool thing is great with a front wheel motor: <b>four</b> -wheel <b>drive</b> - spin the rear wheel with pedals, the motor turns the front wheel, it is very useful on a loose surface. <br><br>  Motor: 250 W / 36 V with a brushless motor with a gearbox and an overrunning clutch, which allows to roll forward when the engine is idle, the manufacturer's stated mileage is up to 45 km in economy mode. <br><br>  The maximum speed to which the motor helps: 25 km / h, of course, you can drive faster, but only on your own without the help of a motor. <br><br>  Battery: Panasonic 18650 x 20pcs x 2900 mAh = 58 Ah ¬∑ (208.8 Wh) <br><br>  You can easily remove the battery, for this you need to push the seat to a maximum up, press the latch under the rear lamp and remove the battery by the rear lamp. <br><br>  This can be very convenient, since you <u>do not need to carry the entire bike to the outlet</u> to charge it.  It becomes possible to charge it at work, in a hotel, and other places where the presence of such units may be inappropriate.  Initially, the battery is bolted with two screws, and it also has a rational grain: it can not be quickly pulled off if you left the bike unattended.  So decide which option is more convenient for you: easily removable or vandal-resistant, the removal of these screws does not affect anything, since the battery is held on the latch and pierced through the seat stem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cf/c8/59cfc8742a065520292089.jpeg"><br><br>  The headlight, so to say it provides the necessary minimum, I personally feel quite comfortable with it in total darkness up to a speed of 15 km / h, higher attention is required.  It does not have any regular adjustments, however, there is a desire to turn it up a little, since the beam power would be enough for more distant illumination.  Location on the frame has both advantages and disadvantages: it does not rotate with the steering wheel, it does not provide full illumination of the direction.  However, the advantages can be recorded that the beam is not tilting from side to side, but rocking very pacifyingly, I personally like it.  The glass has a faceting to form the correct shape of the beam, in the beam of the headlight there is a moderate illumination on the sides, it is obvious to compensate for the non-fiddiness of the headlight.  For lovers of night driving, I recommend an extra powerful lantern on the steering wheel. <br><br>  Dimensions: length 129 cm, height 96 cm, span of the steering wheel 56 cm, distance between the centers of the axles of the wheels 87 cm. <br><br>  Mass: 14.5 kg, which is a very good indicator, the counterparts roll over the mark of 17 kg. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cf/c7/59cfc7fe79bdf003672487.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cf/c7/59cfc7fd07023873123789.jpeg"><br><br>  In a compact trunk, the Nissan Juke fits snugly, so that in the trunk of normal cars it will be very easy to place: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cf/c7/59cfc7fb9c230039906444.jpeg"><br><br>  If there is very little space, then the seat can be removed and placed separately from the large one, this will make it even more compact. <br><br>  Three pedaling speeds allow you to drive comfortably even without a motor, so there is no fear of discharging the battery for a walk.  Planetarka is a great bushing!  Unlike the traditional one with asterisks, the planetary bushing is closed, not serviced, very reliable and able to change gears not only consistently but also arbitrarily, from any to any. <br><br>  In the photo from left to right: <br><br>  1. Planetary gear switch, plastic, it is desirable to put protection. <br>  2. Blackblack - the same force sensor on the pedal, which makes the magic help motor. <br>  3. Asterisk with a chain. <br>  4. Wheel. <br>  5. Roller brake. <br>  6. The magnet holding is large when folded, it also has a hole for mounting the wing rack. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cf/c7/59cfc7fa31a04119047788.jpeg"><br><br>  Rear brake - Roller.  Not a very common design, but it has several advantages: Powerful;  Complete independence from dust, dirt, water and snow;  No rim wear;  The possibility of long-term work without adjustments and settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cf/cf/59cfcf936e181511639303.jpeg"><br><br>  Steering wheel - I met two unfounded complaints on the network: <br><br>  The first myth - the steering wheel has a backlash supposedly due to folding.  Obviously, the person simply does not know that in the folding unit there is an adjustment of the latching force, a hex bolt.  And in general, surprisingly, the bike was assembled and stretched very soundly, no complaints to that. <br><br>  The second myth - for folding you need to unscrew the hex bolt.  You do not need to unscrew it, it is just an adjustment of the latching force, they need to set the necessary tension once and not touch it again.  The bike is fully folded and unfolded very easily and without tools. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cf/c7/59cfc7f54ff0b137920830.jpeg"><br><br>  If necessary, adjust the height of the steering wheel, in stores there is an analogue of the steering rack (also folding) with adjustable height. <br><br>  Regular pedals without bearings, just an iron axis and a plastic pedal, and between them - grease.  Despite this asceticism to them, there are no complaints so far; it is possible that they will appear after a while as they wear out. <br><br>  If you make any modifications do not forget to analyze what will be in the folded state.  Therefore, I recommend to consider the original kit as a set of wings and parking leg, as it provides for folding the rear wing to provide the ability to roll large in the folded state. <br><br>  In the absence of shock absorbers it is useful to install a wider rubber.  There is a reserve of space, you can install rubber, for example, 2.25 inches.  Native wheels - pneumatic 16x1.75 inches.  I also plan to put a softer seat with springs and possibly a seatpost with a shock absorber because it is harsh on the ground, it feels like belonging to an urban class. <br><br>  A question that interested me but I could not find the answer online: <br><br>  A seatpost with seat mounting is pressed into the pipe to adjust the height of the saddle, and if you want to deploy it or replace it, you will have to recall the metalworking skills.  The pipe is not round; there is a groove to prevent the seat from turning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cf/c9/59cfc97986e9e342325098.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Please note:</b> for the first start it may be necessary to connect the bike to the network despite the fact that the battery is charged.  However, the charging has a Chinese plug, and if you want to turn on when buying, you need to have either an adapter for the outlet, or you can use a completely different wire outlet-charging, since it has a standard connector on the charging side.  With this, I got into a mess, since I received a lot at the post office and because of the non-standard plug it was not possible to completely verify it.  I relied on the integrity of the factory seals on the box, I was lucky, everything turned on when I connected to the network. <br><br>  Take care of your health without waiting for problems, do not stay up at home, all active and positive! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/cf/d2/59cfd282268b3397832008.jpeg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370869/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370869/</a></p>
