We are glad that you agreed to give an interview to our forum.

      <b>1. What city are you from?</b>  <b>Do you live in Russia or another country?</b> <br>  We live and work in Moscow.  Sometimes, of course, we attract specialists for one-time tasks from other cities. <br><br>  <b>2. When did you decide to open the parking service?</b>  <b>How long was the idea matured until it was implemented?</b> <br>  We had previous projects related to traffic on the Internet.  After all, in order for the parking project to work successfully, it is necessary to accumulate a knowledge base, statistics and experience.  Domain parking is a continuation of our series of projects. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>3. What difficulties have you encountered in the process of preparing for the opening of the service?</b> <br>  First of all, we were faced with the question: ‚ÄúHow to ensure the greatest conversion of Russian traffic into money?‚Äù.  After all, it is not a secret to anyone that the Internet advertising market in Russia is developing at a frantic pace, but at the same time, it is still not as widely developed as in the West.  And from here - the lack of advertising on many subjects.  We have to fill these ‚Äúadvertising emptiness‚Äù with similar topics or being more general.  For example, the owner of a parked domain registers the keywords "tours to Spain" to his domain.  But advertising partners have only 2 ads of companies that offer tours to Spain.  Our technology itself ‚Äúpicks up‚Äù ads from similar topics, for example: ‚Äúholidays in Egypt‚Äù, ‚Äútravel credits‚Äù, etc.  This was the main difficulty. <br><br>  <b>4. Was it easy to negotiate with advertisers?</b> <br>  Today we are working with one "big advertiser", this is the company "Runner".  It was not easy, we had to develop and implement some standards for high-quality processing of traffic to prevent cheating by unscrupulous users.  ‚ÄúRunner‚Äù respects its advertisers.  This required both organizational and technical solutions. <br>  Soon we will have additional opportunities for advertising through our service.  We also host thematic advertising of various affiliate programs. <br><br>  <b>5. Your service is becoming more and more popular.</b>  <b>I myself park you have several domains.</b>  <b>Apparently, you have to rent a very powerful server?</b>  <b>How long have you picked up a company where you decided to host?</b> <br>  We have our own servers in a large Moscow data center. <br><br>  <b>6. Surely there are unscrupulous users who are trying to cheat statistics.</b>  <b>How is your service built antifrodovaya system?</b> <br>  Most of the artificial traffic is determined at the time of its occurrence.  Such clicks are free for cheaters and advertisers.  The rest of the markups are detected after the traffic analysis by the statistics and checking module by the person. <br><br>  <b>7. Can you provide any statistics?</b> <br>  Visitors: Russia - 60%, European Union - 20%, Ukraine - 5%.  Domains: RU - 50%, COM, NET, ORG, BIZ, INFO - 30%, UA - 5%.  The average user income from 1000 visitors (RPM) 10 $.  This is a very good indicator that we managed successfully with the main task ‚Äî a profitable convertible of Russian traffic. <br><br>  <b>8. Is domain parking today a profitable business for a parking service, as well as for domain owners themselves?</b> <br>  What is essentially a domain parking?  This is a rental of advertising spaces.  And advertising is such a thing that at all times has been beneficial: and advertisers, and consumers, and owners of advertising places, and advertising agencies.  We are essentially a media buying agency. <br><br>  <b>9. What would you advise domain owners for successful parking?</b>  <b>Perhaps there are any tricks, tricks (of course not violating the rules and the law)?</b> <br>  The main task of the domain owner is optimization, which is to analyze traffic and identify topics that interest visitors.  Then register domains for keywords that will display ads.  Usually one or three words is enough to show targeted competitive links.  Through our tool "word selection" in the control panel, you can pick up words and see the cost of ads.  The main trick and ploy is to do all this competently and efficiently. <br><br>  <b>10. Do you have a lot of IDN domains?</b>  <b>What is your opinion about their perspective?</b> <br>  Russian IDN domains today represent 1% of all parked.  The direction is uniquely promising, especially when IDN registration finally opens in the RU zone.  Such domains already work for us. <br><br>  <b>11. And the last question.</b>  <b>When do you plan to please us with a domain selling site?</b> <br>  PARKED.RU will gradually show features for domain sellers, such as ‚Äúsending a message to the owner‚Äù and ‚Äúattendance counters‚Äù.  And the site itself Sale.Parked.ru fully open in a few months.  In addition to selling domains on the site, several completely new services will be available. <br><br>  <b>Well, we wish you every success in such a difficult and at the same time interesting work!</b> <br>  Thanks.  We are sure that Russia is no worse than England and America.  Russian developers, domainers, IT-specialists, women and football players are the best in the world.  Therefore, we have every chance to make the project PARKED.RU - Russian domain parking is one of the best.  Happiness and success! <br><br>  Questions compiled by the user Manager Forum IDNF.RU |  Forum International Domain Names </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/7486/">https://habr.com/ru/post/7486/</a></p>
