But further commercial success in the "big business" provides an entire team, not related to the development.  One of the main roles in this process is played by leading sales professionals. <br><br>  However, the incomes of the richest founders and the richest sales directors differ significantly.  A rough estimate of how they differ, help research. <a name="habracut"></a>

      On Wednesday, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/katiasavchuk/2016/08/10/jeff-bezos-mark-zuckerberg-tech-billionaires-biggest-gainers/">a</a> new ranking of the 100 richest personalities in the IT industry, according to Forbes, appeared.
