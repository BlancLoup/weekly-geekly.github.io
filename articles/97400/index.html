But The Clef is not only valuable headphones, but also 3-4 <s>kilograms ...</s> accessory. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Even the photo shows that the headphones do not look quite usual.  This is just a blister (box), which is their "shell", and also contains some chips, which later will tell and show. <br><br>  Let's start in order.  Packaging does not contain anything remarkable.  Rather ascetic black box, in which only headphones and brief instructions.

They go jogging, ride a bike, go hiking and so on, because, probably, these headphones will not give much comfort to the ordinary ordinary listener at home. <br><br>  The headphones themselves are white.  A bit small, although rather, simply unusual, since they sit comfortably in the ear, do not fall out and do not interfere.  The wire is flat because the headphones fold like a snail into its case.  If someone used small mice for laptops, they probably saw about the same design.  You pull the wires in different directions and the coil spins up, then you pull a little bit and the wire rolls back.  Also arranged here. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d9/21c/a9a/2d921ca9a2c8623b91310ac83287c9cf.jpg"><br><br>  As for the speakers themselves, their design is open, and I think this is very good, because during active sports you will still hear what is happening around and will be able to avoid various excesses. <br><br>  No soft ear cushions here, and they are not needed.  Only a rubber bezel around the metal mesh of the speaker. <br>  By the way, they reminded me of Apple‚Äôs standard headphones. <br><br>  As I said, the headphones are hidden in a blister of white color, which on the one hand acts as a container for convenient storage of The Clef, and on the other hand it is the fastening of the wire during the run.  It has special notches for fixing the headphones, so everything keeps on perfectly. <br><br>  On the box there are two types of mounting.  The first - a carbine in order to hang, for example, on the keys.  It will be unrealistic to listen to them from this position, but it is quite convenient for transportation.  You can also hang on a backpack and, if the player is in a backpack, it will also be convenient to use them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/447/9c4/3a1/4479c43a1fd2a181d940364e54ab0669.jpg"><br><br>  And the second - fastening on a belt or on a shirt collar, here it is more convenient for someone.  I fastened at the gate, because the wire did not reach the belt.  By the way, this is one of the drawbacks, because 1.2 meters of the wire are clearly not enough here and I want to have at least 2 meters, because if the belt is attached, then the length of the wires to the ears is not enough, and if it is attached to the gate, then barely enough to reach the player who is in his pocket.  Well and still, the blister is a little big, so when it hangs near the neck it is not very comfortable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/346/c3b/5b6/346c3b5b6062f234194d11a5a0408638.jpg"><br><br>  When ‚Äústretching‚Äù the headphones, you get this design: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/51a/f05/a39/51af05a39dfe94abe923ac848b1ce83e.jpg"><br><br>  As you have probably noticed, there is a battery compartment under the clamp.  But why is she here? <br>  And all because there is a small red flashlight on the bottom of the blister case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d05/30a/d06/d0530ad068cbfb6cbbcbeab5bc0bcd0f.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, it is not enough to light the way in a dark forest, but to help yourself in the dark entrance to find the hole of the castle - very much so.  Although, in my subjective opinion, this is pampering.  But if you come back late in the evening from a run, then it will be very useful for you. <br><br>  Here is such a charming color it burns. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b0b/a57/7df/b0ba577df26cf78a7b5914c601d0be5e.jpg"><br><br>  As for the sound, for such a small model it is quite decent.  Of course, there is no reason to expect strong bass here, but there is enough quality to enjoy your favorite songs on vacation.  Noise and scrape during playback was not detected (tested on iPod Classic and iriver).  A little "swallows" high notes, but in general, if you do not listen to opera concerts, then everything suits you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/593/c0a/133/593c0a133c5e1007f9002725555eb958.jpg"><br><br>  I liked how clef sit in the ear.  Almost imperceptibly, wearing headphones, both externally and on sensations.  Nothing presses and, more importantly, does not fall out.  Small and neat. <br><br>  The price varies around 500-700 rubles.  Little or many?  You decide.  I will bring it into advantages, because in my opinion, this is an acceptable price for headphones of this kind, especially Koss. <br><br>  pros <br>  + Miniature design <br>  + Ease of transportation <br>  + Two mounts <br>  + Decent sound quality <br>  + Flashlight <br><br>  Minuses <br>  - Short wire <br>  - Massive blister <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/776/c5b/379/776c5b3799baea522612394623ca2dea.jpg"><br><br>  Koss The Clef, I think, is another good representative of sports headphones.  Active people will like the comfort and convenience in handling.  So, if there are music lovers-athletes, then this option is for you.  The price is adequate, in this price range almost all headphones are the same, but here‚Äôs a flashlight only in these =) <br>  I liked the sound, quite enough for comfortable listening. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/97400/">https://habr.com/ru/post/97400/</a></p>
