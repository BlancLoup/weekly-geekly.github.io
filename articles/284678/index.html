  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Like i was a porn trader</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Based on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Dura_Lex/137483/">this</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Dura_Lex/137513/">this</a> articles: <br><br>  I would like to warn the naive (mostly, of course, young) people who read comments in the style of "cooperate with the investigation."  Perhaps this story will be instructive for someone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, it was 2006.  I, a 19-year-old student-bachelor, was lucky to open my ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù - a tiny department in a walking distance shopping center with a computer for downloading melodies (remember, there were such) and minor repairs of cell phones.  Everything was going fine, I poured myself <i>"pictures - 3p, melodies -5"</i> and did not know grief.  Until I talked to a talkative young man. <br><br><h5>  You are treated </h5><br>  We chatted about this and that, he downloaded a couple of tunes and left ... He returned a couple of days later, he downloaded a decent amount of content and in between times wondered if I had a <i>‚Äúwell, you understand, for adults‚Äù</i> .  I showed some innocuous videos and he bluntly said that he was not interested in it and would like to be <i>‚Äúharder‚Äù</i> .  At that time, there was no special Internet in our province and I was not embarrassed by his request to download at home, especially for him.  In the evening I pumped up rollers for him and began to rub my hands in anticipation of such a large exclusive sale ...

    <h5>  Test purchase </h5><br>  He came in the evening in a light drunk and with a girlfriend (good, after it turned out that she was still an adult, otherwise who knows how it would all end).  Having fun and casual banter on his companion, he began to watch one-by-one videos, refusing to push a whole folder into his heaped mobile phone.  I poured him 17 or 18 videos, taking 100 (one hundred) rubles.  Then another ‚Äúmarried couple‚Äù came up, wandered around the shop windows nearby and the men showed their certificates ... They asked to return the steward, in the presence of witnesses (the girls) checked the numbers and asked me not to touch the computer again.  They sealed the system officer, they insistently asked me not to call anyone, <i>this is a simple formality</i> .  And we went to their office. <br><br>  Management is a separate story.  There was a full-scale repair, <b>but I did not know</b> .  I was shocked - two men, taking the phone back, were brought to some building with bags of cement in the corridors, put in an office and began to draw up a protocol, saying ‚Äúdon't you worry, just a regular check.‚Äù  In the end, I was told that nothing terrible had happened, and in general I was a normal dude. <br><br><h5>  What not to do </h5><br>  No need to <s>be naive</s> to believe good gentlemen to the police.  You don‚Äôt need to agree to a special order, you don‚Äôt need to believe government lawyers, you don‚Äôt have to admit your guilt, in the end ... After the trial, having met with the investigator by chance, I heard an honest <i>‚Äúwell, anyway, what was you to judge?</i>  <i>Well, not porn - so programs are not licensed</i> . <i>‚Äù</i>  At that time, they didn‚Äôt raid claims for the trade in pirated music to the entire planet. <br><br><h5>  Court </h5><br>  The court still requested an examination of the masterpieces of the industry of those years and eventually turned out to be a paper like <i>‚Äú1z.3gp, hotmom.3gp, anna1436_g.3gp to recognize pornographic due to the lack of a storyline and a detailed image of the genitals of one or both sexes‚Äù</i> signed by respected art critics, professors of the Pedagogical University ... Connoisseurs,‚Ä¶ <br><br>  The court was upsettingly boring and fast: they read the essence of my atrocities, asked to show a personal income tax certificate (I got a job as a laborer with a salary of 3200) and the prosecutor said that the prescribed penalty (242UKRF, 100-300 pipes ¬©) I could not pay, asked 12 months for me conditionally.  On that and decided.  At the last word I tried to say something about the commensurability of crime and punishment, about the scale of my ‚Äústudio for the production and sale of porn‚Äù, but apparently it was not very convincing. <br><br>  By the way, the computer was also "destroyed" by a court decision, as an instrument of crime.  I was surprised that the operas from ‚ÄúK‚Äù ‚Äúhumanly‚Äù returned me a CD with 60Gigami mp3. <br><br><h5>  Instead of conclusion </h5><br>  Yes, now I understand that it was possible to do everything differently and achieve the same excuse, you could build your defense on anything, and not listen to the advice of operatives, investigators ... There are quite a lot of young people in IT, IT specialists, who can also It's easy to get caught up on such everyday things.  If at least one of them remembers this story - it means that I am not in vain maral keyboard.  I ask for a long and possibly poorly readable post - I cannot claim to be a writer.  Just a story that I wanted to tell. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/284678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/284678/</a></p>
