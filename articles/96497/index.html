Basically, they seemed not to collect the firmware (about this in the above-mentioned topic), namely, to upload the finished version to the smart.  Therefore, I will try to describe the whole process of reflashing step by step using the example of my Nokia 5530, but I will add a few more words to the above topic. <br>  Many screenshots <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, to everything that is indicated in the above topic, I would like to add: <br>  <b>STEP 1</b> <br>  I do not advise to put a daw about the point of hacking.  After installing the firmware, RomPatcher + was bundled, but did not open, and didn‚Äôt react in any way, respectively, we can assume that the smart is not hacked.  But you will not be able to remove or reinstall it, since it is ‚Äúbuilt-in‚Äù, respectively, you will have to re-flash it again. <br>  Touch control is better to leave - this is the same slide-strip, on which you have to hold your finger when an incoming call.  Otherwise, you will have to manually unlock the phone. <br>  Rotate the main screen.  If your phone for life looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/59/9e/599e22f4b4c57065c9198956e4902159.png" alt="image"><br><br>  then you can leave the rotation of the main screen, since it also rotates the dialing menu and the incoming call screen:

It will respond to the accelerometer in the same way as other folders / programs. <br>  The remaining items put on your own. <br>  <b>STEP 2</b> <br>  Here I would like to focus on the topic ‚Äútheme effects‚Äù <br>  I set myself Ultimate effects, and I can say that they do not slow down at all and are in perfect harmony with the effects of handyshell 2, i.e.  windows are changing slides, the effect of changing spatial orientation and viewing images is well implemented (for everyone: <a href="http://ifolder.ru/18172415">iFolder</a> link) <br>  In the program menu, simply select the folder with the effects. <br>  It's like everything.  Collect the finished file, delete some crap in the file name at the beginning (the program will remind you of everything) and replace the file in the Products folder.  I have this file, respectively, RM-504_20.0.080_prd.rofs2.V05 <br><br><h4>  Data recovery </h4><br>  Frankly, I do not know whether it is possible to restore files from the old firmware to the new one.  I just took another nokia (e51), and in sync mode I threw in all the calendars, SMS, contacts, and so on. <br><br><h4>  Actually firmware </h4><br>  First you need to delete everything related to Nokia OVI / PC Suit.  It is desirable along with everything that lies in the registry.  You can leave only the drivers for the cable. <br>  So, it is assumed that the firmware you have already downloaded and installed.  If not, then it should be taken <a href="http://allnokia.ru/firmware/">here</a> . <br>  Further, <a href="http://forum.allnokia.ru/viewtopic.php%3Ft%3D48397">here we</a> download all three files that appear under the <b>download</b> title and install them.  After that, you must always set the compatibility mode with XP SP2. <br>  Go to the Start JAF icon or j_emu.exe, select the Thomas key and immediately go to the BB5 tab. <br><br><hr><h6>  Lyrical digression # 1 </h6><br>  Actually, from that moment I started having problems.  In general, I will not describe them for a long time, as there were many of them.  I will only make a reservation that I could not say goodbye in the ‚Äúlive‚Äù phone mode. <br>  Therefore, I was stitching in DeadUSB mode.  To do this, you need to pull the battery out of the phone for 2-3 minutes, and then put it in place, not including.  In this form, the phone and connect to the cable. <br><hr><br><br>  So, according to the selected ‚Äúdead phone‚Äù method, <u>remove the</u> <b>CRT 308 checkbox</b> , and set the daws: <b>Factory Set, Manual Flash, Normal mode, DEAD USB (all in general)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/6d/b0/6db01b077348748bc0bf8228371d56db.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Next is the hemorrhoid: <br>  1) Click the first green MCU button and select the firmware file itself (In fact, this file has the extension * .C00, you just need to rename it to * .C0R.): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ef/59/ef59a18aab747a9dc31ece56b6de3088.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Looks like that: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ab/85/ab8573df7a911eef89901cf314c695c7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  2) Next, click on the second green PPM button and select the localization file (this is the one that we have previously shredded): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/5e/15/5e15a2a6b837395f691b841cd7470a8e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Here's what it looks like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2a/11/2a117e22f152c08e01b5736c8c921f37.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  3) Click the third green button CNT (this is graphics). <br><hr><h6>  Lyrical digression # 2 </h6><br>  I could not understand what the program wants from me, since none of the files fit.  It appeared that the following should be done: <br><hr><br>  At the bottom of the window, change the file name from <b>DCT4</b> to <b>All files</b> in the column: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/7e/ed/7eed237401a176ffba22763bf37e9621.jpg" alt="image"><br>  From these files, you can choose any.  I remember that C01 is a red theme, and C06 is pink.  At the expense of the rest just can not remember.  Where there is blue, yellow and gray. <br>  Looks like: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/91/6e/916ea23b8f084154fe91af99a88ba2c1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  4) Click the last green APE VARIANT button (I don't know what it is): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/bc/44/bc442dbf6c734b647e4d58c3da2032cd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Total before the firmware we have the following: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/49/f8/49f8b90d7719901b6e456e0eb038cbb8.jpg" alt="image"><br>  5) <b>(sic!) Here we must act smartly</b> .  Perform the following sequence of actions: <br>  We press Flash and agree - we connect the phone to the outlet (!) - immediately press and hold the power button until the screen lights up. <br><br>  Everything installation went.  It goes quickly - about 5 minutes. Then on the small screen something like this lights up: <br><img src="http://xmages.net/out.php/i125819_IMG3567.jpg" alt="image"><br>  or such: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0f2/32b/4e4/0f232b4e491bf37db3fd3c8c25a4117b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  It takes another 30 seconds, and the program reports that everything went well.  You can safely tear out the phone and wait. <br>  I made it a total of 7-8 times, of which 2 times it turned on not immediately, but after 5 minutes. <br>  As a result, I can say that the phone began to run noticeably faster, never rebooted, and generally happy.  Thank you for your attention and good luck! <br><br>  Run on Win7 x86 Ult <br>  <b>ATTENTION!</b>  <b>You do everything at your own peril and risk!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96497/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96497/</a></p>
