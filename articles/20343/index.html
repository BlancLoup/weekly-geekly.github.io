      This experiment is very fond of reproducing in schools and universities throughout the world.  Fortunately, you need quite a bit: only two boxes, one of which shows three lines, on the other one.  The subject is asked to say which of the three lines drawn together is equal to the length of the line drawn separately.  A simple task. <br><br>  But ... Before giving a completely obvious answer, the subject must listen to the answers of his five colleagues.  And they all as one call the absolutely wrong option.  What to do?!  On the one hand, no one demands that all the answers coincide, and the eyes clearly see the correct version.  On the other hand ... In general, at least a third of the subjects show conformism and call the wrong option offered by the rest of the study participants.  They, by the way, are not test subjects at all, but accomplices of the experimenter. <br><br>  This result astonished even the organizer of the experiment, Solomon Ashe.  He was certain that US citizens who were educated in the spirit of individualism should not succumb to the pressure of the group.  But human nature was stronger than the traditions of free-thinking. <br><br>  The fact that a person obeys the pressure of the group is not new.  More interesting than experiment modification.  For example, in one of the versions there was an ‚Äúaddict‚Äù test subject who called the wrong version that was different from the others (for example, the correct answer was the ‚Äúsecond line‚Äù, four participants said ‚Äúthe third‚Äù, and one - the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù).  When the ‚Äúdecoy‚Äù group lost its unity, the ‚Äúnaive‚Äù test subjects gave much more correct answers. <br><br>  Time The results of the experiment were published in 1951.  The Second World War ended recently, the American society was in euphoria: we defeated totalitarian fascism, our people are free and independent, we can never be like this! .. Ash's experiment was a blow to this confidence. <br><br>  Moral Unity of opinion - a dangerous thing.  In order to adequately perceive reality, there must be dissidents in society, and it is not so important whether they are telling the truth or bear total nonsense - the main thing is for their opinion to differ from the position of the majority. <br><br>  Where can one come across with this When assessing world events, when choosing a book in a store, when voting in elections, when buying a new mobile phone ... ‚Äù <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.expert.ru/printissues/russian_reporter/2008/04/teatr_psihologa/">Link to the whole article</a></strong> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20343/</a></p>
