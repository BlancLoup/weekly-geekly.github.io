  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Typical ExtJS based applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I will talk about what tasks ExtJS solves best and what a typical application is based on this library. <a name="habracut"></a>  This article is an introduction to the next one, designed for people who have worked with the library for some time.  And at the same time, this article is independent, since I do not plan to refer to it in the future. <br><br>  <em>This material is based on my personal experience.</em> <br><br>  The ExtJS library is great for the administrative part of projects and projects related to reports.  My experience is based on the creation of several projects of the latter type. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      All reports with which I dealt, in principle, are identical in form.  They look schematically like this: <br><br><img src="http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/4793/typicalreport.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, a similar view is characteristic of many other projects, but for reporting projects, a similar view is a matter of course.  Next, I will describe a few more characteristic features and explain to what I am leading. <br><br>  In the menu navigation area, either a tree, or a list is made, or in the form of an accordion with a tree / list menu.  In the content area - grid.  For reports, he usually does not have the ability to edit.  For various settings in the project, the grid has add / delete buttons in the top toolbar.  Most often, there is also a place for the edit button (however, ExtJS in its EditorGridPanel component allows you to edit entries right on the line). <br><br>  This, or a similar type of application is implemented using ExtJS easily and simply.  It has a component Viewport, which is the working area of ‚Äã‚Äãyour application.  ‚ÄúRoot‚Äù panel, to which other nodes are mounted.  If we take our example with reports, then these nodes will be the ‚ÄúNavigation Area‚Äù and the ‚ÄúContent Area‚Äù, which will provide the framework for a typical ExtJS application.  Strictly speaking, this is exactly how the examples on the official website built most of the applications from the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.extjs.com/products/extjs/">Combination Samples</a> ‚Äú section. <br><br>  Regarding the navigation elements and the content area, there are typical components in this library: various buttons, an accordion, a tree, and a grid.  Everything is fine tuned and has good documentation.  Judging from my experience - not complete, but 99% of the documentation for all components will be true.  The documentation is filled with examples and getting lost in it is quite difficult.  The library also has an active community and the forum will always promptly answer your questions (often during the day).  Thus, if you have a task to develop a reporting system or an administrative part of a project, and you are looking for a mature JS framework, I strongly recommend that you familiarize yourself with ExtJS. <br><br>  In the next article I will talk about what I did not find on the network myself.  About designing medium / large projects using ExtJS.  How to make it beautiful, neat and to support it was a pleasure. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75702/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75702/</a></p>
