This is the first post <a href="http://ru.wix.com/">of the Wix site designer</a> , today we will talk about what our product is from a technological point of view, how our engineers work and what beliefs we share in development and deployment (which happens every 7 minutes in Wix). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f82/0d0/886/f820d0886ca34c1b8576a978f6fd3824.jpg"></div><br>  But first things first. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">A bit of history: how it all began</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>The legend says:</b> <br><br>  The idea to make a tool that will facilitate the process of developing sites came to the co-founders of Wix on the beach: the Avishai and Nadav Abraami brothers, as well as Giora Kaplan, who already had several successful IT projects, during the creation of the site for their new startup realized that it's too hard work for them.  Colleagues decided to create a project that will turn this process into a simple and intuitive and free from the need to hire designers and programmers.

      Initially, in 2006, founders received investments to create another project.  They returned to investors and said: "Instead, we will make a simple and clear cloud site builder."  Investors agreed, so was born Wix. <br><br>  The launch of the flash editor took place in 2008, and in 2009 the Wix audience had a million users.  By the way, Wix was translated into Russian in 2012. </div></div><br>  Wix is ‚Äã‚Äãa simple and clear online platform for creating websites.  At Wix‚Äôs R &amp; D department, we are developing cloud-based web services that provide online presence for more than 80 million users in 190 countries.  To support such an infrastructure, 350 software engineers work with Scala, Node, React, Angular technologies;  cloud platforms (Google, Amazon and Azure) and advanced methodologies such as Continuous delivery and TDD (Test Driven Development). <br><br>  Our philosophy is that a great software engineer is, first and foremost, a great engineer.  This means that we evaluate a potential candidate not by what languages ‚Äã‚Äãhe works with, but by how deeply he understands and feels the program code.  At the same time, we are always open to candidates who work on a different technological stack: we know that with our help, the transition to the stack we use does not cause difficulties. <br><br>  By the way, if you would be interested in learning more about how to find a job or move to live in Israel, write about it in the comments, we will prepare a post about it.  Well, check out <a href="http://www.wix.com/jobs/home">our vacancies</a> page: you can choose between an office in Tel Aviv, New York, San Francisco, Vilnius or Dnepropetrovsk. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#f9a339">How we are working</font> </h2><br>  Everyone who wants to work in Wix needs to understand in what inhuman conditions there are 1000 of these unfortunates: cold beer in refrigerators every day;  nuts, fruit and junk food in the kitchen;  terrace overlooking the sea, breakfast and ice cream. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ec3/9f0/5fa/ec39f05faaeb4a1abaaec0a0435e6fc5.PNG"></div><br>  Dogs, finally: literally every day someone from colleagues comes to the office with a dog!  Moreover, recently in our internal network, colleagues launched an application that would allow dog owners to plan the arrival of pets in the office.  If you know that your Jackie is not getting along with the design department dachshund, you can check the calendar and, for example, decide to leave your pet at home.  Or call the designer and ask him today to come without a taxi.  And tomorrow you will change. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/871/386/3fb/8713863fb3de4ab794e021881901df2c.PNG"></div><br>  In general, we, like most residents of Tel Aviv, love dogs too much (even in the office). <br><br><h2>  <font color="#f9a339">About the development cycle</font> </h2><br>  The main method of our work is the development through testing (Test Driven Development or simply TDD).  TDD allows us to write clean, supported, easy to read and replaceable code. <br><br>  Due to this, we have an extremely fast development cycle, and we create the necessary tools to continue this.  Quite a common situation for us, when the code appears on the site, written a few days ago.  This is a pleasant surprise for engineers who have previously worked in other companies, where months or years pass before the actual use of the code begins: here every employee has the opportunity to instantly influence what is happening. <br><br>  Moreover, each developer can place his code on the combat server.  In 2015, we had 17 thousand deployments.  Therefore, developers enjoy absolute freedom, bear full responsibility and write code that is easy to read, change and maintain. <br><br>  Working with information across the Internet requires ideas from all areas of computer science, including information extraction, distributed computing, network technologies, security, and user interface design ‚Äî the list grows every day.  Each software engineer works in a small team.  Teams and projects can change as our dynamic business grows and develops. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#f9a339">Want to learn something new?</font>  <font color="#f9a339">Share your knowledge</font> </h2><br>  We also like to talk about what we do, share information about the projects, processes and products we work on.  In our MeetUp-group ‚Äú <a href="http://www.meetup.com/at-wix/">Wix Engineering</a> ‚Äù there are already over 3,500 participants from the Israeli community, and their number is constantly growing.  Of course, we also take part in meetings organized by other groups, and often make presentations not only in Israel, but also at Qcon, ngconf, WebSummit, build stuff and other programmer conferences in Europe and the USA. <br><br>  In the following posts we will tell you more interesting stories about how Wix development works.  For example, in plans material about scaling to 100 million users.  In the meantime, share in the comments what you would like to ask us more? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/279357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/279357/</a></p>
