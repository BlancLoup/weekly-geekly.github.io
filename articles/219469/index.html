Some argue that only a talented person can be successful.  Others object, success is a lottery.  It is impossible, of course, to ignore the insight, some even manage to pull out a lucky ticket, but all this does not happen often, but you have to constantly move your brains. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dd4/c80/a84/dd4c80a84889bd423a85936be745e7ad.png" alt="Hierarchical organization" align="right"><br>  Brain perturbation is not an easy task.  Often we just think what we think, and in fact we manipulate the facts, give them different interpretations, forget about the time factor, expand the isolated case to a whole class of phenomena, give what we want for the real, come up with something that really does not exist, and in general, we create mental models that only vaguely resemble the real world.  Having all this variety of delusions in our inflamed brain - we make the wrong decisions that create new problems, they in turn distort feedbacks and lead us to even more bad judgments, and with each new round we are moving further and further away from the truth.  Therefore, each of us, drags on his back the burden of earlier decisions.  Well, when they can be written off, worse when you have to pay for them.  Pay and repent: "God ... how stupid I was!" <br><br>  Weak people at this moment break, go into themselves, and the rest of life is drifting.  The others, having read the first sentence of this text, beat their heads against the wall with even greater frenzy, i.e.  persistently move brains. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

    <blockquote>  We think only when faced with a problem. <br>  John Dewey </blockquote><br><br>  Every time, flying at full speed into fat, making unimaginable pirouettes there, hoping to stay on your feet, you begin to feel like a forever reprimanding student: ‚ÄúNext time I will start preparing for the session right away.‚Äù  At this awkward moment, all internal reserves are mobilized, a mad leap of thoughts begins in a half-empty head, their little claws ring out loudly on the inner side of the skull, a gradual warming of the head is felt.  This brain enters turbo mode.  There is a search for causal relationships, a picture of the world breaks down.  Your world view system, from which you once blew out dust particles, spread to shreds, fragments go into a long drift to a new attractor.  New books suddenly appear in your library: ‚ÄúThe Art of Moving on Fat Substances‚Äù, ‚ÄúTypes and Classification of Fat‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to Fall in Fat‚Äù.  The appearance of periodicals is possible: ‚ÄúClothes and accessories for falling into fat‚Äù, ‚ÄúWorld of fat‚Äù, ‚ÄúSystemic fat expert‚Äù.  Or even the memoirs of the dead: "My life is my fat."  In short, full fat from LJ. <br><br>  Tightly stuffing new information into your head, like chicken fluff into a pillow, remembering all the episodes of a collision with a yellow substance, mentally playing brilliant and disastrous gestures, you begin to build a new picture of the world, to invent new methods of struggle, to change your behavior and lifestyle.  Most likely, the nearest environment of changes in you will not notice a damn thing, but internally you are already assembled, you stand straight, and already slightly dried fat falls off in pieces.  The main thing is that the development vector has already been set. <br><br><blockquote>  There are only two endless things: the universe and stupidity.  Although about the universe, I'm not quite sure. <br>  Albert Einstein </blockquote><br><br>  The first quality race in lipid substances in my life occurred after making a firm decision to become a programmer.  It is necessary to understand that in my time, programmers not only wrote programs, but also poked around at computers, repaired lamp TVs ... for me they were celestials ... now they are called stupidly - IT specialists.  Then I tried to try everything and climbed everywhere my little hands reached.  Thanks to my parents for this, it was they who created my attraction to computer technology, bestowing a clone of the Spectrum with 48 kb of RAM on board.  But over time, I realized that the universe - the lady is insidious and tends to get fat and expand in volume, and my physical abilities to know everything and everyone - were greatly exaggerated.  Therefore, I learned to applied mathematics and even became a writing web programmer.  Since then - I will not let go. <br><br>  The next successful hit to glycerol esters occurred in a couple of years - I got into the banking sector, where I was able to observe for several years, both positive and negative examples of changes in organizations.  And although my work was also related to information technology, I still had to actively communicate with various members of the human race and analyze my environment.  In other words, the situation changed in such a way that I was forced to break out of the logical world of programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãand, with all the dope, fly into the world of irrational human relations, hidden games, and sometimes the frank stupidity of some individuals.  The need to realize has reappeared.  It was necessary to realize a lot - human psychology, methods of management struggle, principles of building organizations ... so I got a second education. <br><br><blockquote>  Every person may be mistaken, but only a fool can persist in delusion. <br>  Cicero </blockquote><br><br>  Reckless faith in information technology has played a cruel joke with me.  I had a hope that with the help of my knowledge and skills, using modern technologies, I would be able to change the world for the better, even locally around me.  Once again, the reality turned out to be much harsher than previously thought: ‚ÄúThe magic pill did not come out of IT‚Äù. <br><br>  It is well known that for the treatment of diseases of living organisms a variety of therapeutic agents are used and certain conditions are created.  Remember, in childhood, the doctor prescribed you for bed rest?  On the other hand, if for various reasons there was a desire to get sick, then there was a means tested by schoolchildren, icy icicles.  Moreover, no pill will help a person if he has a strong desire to suicide. <br><br>  There is no paradox that all the same principles apply to societies and organizations.  By creating the conditions and using the right tools, we extend the life of the company.  Edwards Deming, said on this occasion a wonderful phrase: "You can not change - survival is not an obligation."  Today, information technologies are the means that allows you to effectively compete.  However, there are some nuances when this tool is effective. <br><br><blockquote>  It is extremely dangerous to underestimate the power of stupid in large human groups. <br>  Folk wisdom </blockquote><br><br>  Probably the effect of Daning-Kruger in narrow circles crammed.  For those who do not know, I repeat: ‚ÄúPeople with low qualifications, making unsuccessful decisions and making wrong conclusions, are unable to realize this because of their incompetence.‚Äù  Moreover, after training, low-skilled specialists are able to realize their incompetence, even if the overall level of their competence has not grown.  On the other hand, highly qualified specialists tend to underestimate their level of competence. <br><br>  It is believed that the amateur defends his point of view, as the only true and 100% applicable.  These people know the standard solutions for most management problems ‚Äî ERP, lean, agile, itil, and so on.  They easily operate with these concepts, without understanding their genesis and limits of applicability.  However, in most cases, the situation turns out to be even more deplorable. <br><br>  In the late 60s of the 20th century, Lawrence Peter put forward an interesting idea: <b>"In any hierarchical system, an employee seeks to achieve the level of his incompetence</b> . <b>"</b>  In order to understand this, it suffices to consider a typical employee movement algorithm along the career ladder.  Usually, when a new job appears, the manager selects a candidate who has positively manifested himself in the current position.  Promotion is usually associated with a change in the nature of duties performed.  If the employee copes with the current position - he becomes a candidate for a higher one.  In such cases, the captain of evidence says: "Competent employees go up." <br><br>  Sooner or later, an employee reaches a position in which he will not be able to cope with his duties, that is, he will be incompetent.  <b>This is the level of incompetence of the employee</b> .  In such a situation, the return of the employee to the previous level is unlikely, since the lower position is usually occupied, and the management will have to admit their management error.  As a result, although the incompetence of the employee in the new position is obvious, he is not lowered.  Thus, we get the following corollary: ‚ÄúIncompetent employees do <b>NOT</b> go down.‚Äù <br><br>  Returning to the Daning-Kruger effect, one can make a disappointing conclusion: " <b>When reaching the" level of incompetence "and passing training, an incompetent employee realizes his precarious position in the current position and as a result tries to recruit less competent employees to lower positions than he does.</b> " . <br><br>  Since any organization consists of employees working in it who have a certain level of competence, a new concept can be introduced: the general level of the company's competence.  It is logical to assume that the higher the general level of competence of a company, the more competitive and more efficient it is. <br><br>  Thus, the Daning-Krugerav effect in conjunction with the Peter principle leads to a disappointing result: <b>in any hierarchical organization, the overall level of incompetence tends to increase over time, and organization, as a system, degrades</b> .  One can conditionally rephrase the second law of thermodynamics: ‚ÄúIn any hierarchical organization, the overall level of incompetence does not decrease over time.‚Äù <br><br>  Certainly, there are methods of dealing with the virus of incompetence for all kinds of organizational structures.  This is the task of top management. <br><br>  UPD.  Pay attention: according to Peter, ‚Äúthe level of incompetence‚Äù is the official level in the hierarchical structure of the organization, upon the achievement of which, a person is not able to fulfill the entire list of duties assigned to him. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/219469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/219469/</a></p>
