Couple of weeks at work</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the beginning of the month came the long-awaited box with Tachem.  I have this first handheld, so, due to lack of experience, during the week I ran into all the "subtleties" of working with them, ... more precisely, with handhelds under Windows Mobile <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Like many, at first I held to the position that the telephone is only a means to make calls.  Before I bought the Tach, I used the Nokia 3410 for about 5 years, which, in principle, suited me all.  For the time being: <br><ul><li>  Phonebook overflowed </li><li>  6 entries to-do was not enough </li><li>  tired of using T9 for speed dialing on the go. </li></ul><br>  Being a practical person before buying a shift of an old friend, he tried for himself first to clearly formulate the tasks that he should solve, more precisely, what functions he should have: <br><ul><li>  be a GSM phone </li><li>  have a convenient to-do, with the ability to synchronize </li><li>  so that during the call you can turn on the recording of the conversation, make notes </li><li>  be an mp3 player </li><li>  be able to read / edit text files </li></ul><br>  Since, with all this, I terribly did not want to go back to T9, then I immediately oriented to the purchase of a sensory girl. <br><br>  At first, like many, I fired up buying an iPhone.  However, at a certain moment I slowed down ... (about which later) <br><br>  Of the alternatives, due to functional-aesthetic reasons, the choice fell on the HTC Touch.

      About the design I will not say anything, because  all this is subjective.  Let me just say that I am 100% satisfied. <br><br><h1>  Beginning of work </h1><br>  When you turned on the Touch, more precisely, WM6 in the master mode conducted a detailed interrogation: name, mail, etc., and also offered to set up the working area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe touch screen. <br><br>  Here I ran into the first shoal: I scored on a stylus with heated advertising and tried to calibrate the screen with my finger ... the result was not long in coming.  After such a calibration, I was not able to ‚Äúhit‚Äù normally even by the ‚ÄúStart‚Äù button. <br><br>  Half an hour later, realizing the mistake, corrected everything through: <br>  <strong>Start&gt; Settings&gt; System&gt; Screen&gt; Screen Calibration</strong> <br><br>  Having played enough with Kubik, I decided to score my contacts in the normal form (in 3410, about 12 characters were allocated to my name, I don‚Äôt remember exactly). <br><br>  After reading the instructions, I decided to start to reset all contacts in Outlook (and make a copy just in case) and fix everything there and add avatars to contacts.  However, here I ran into the second joint: installed ActiveSync completely refused to synchronize Outlook and the communicator ... <br><br>  I do not know how long I killed (a couple of evenings for sure) until I found a clear instruction on how to set it all up: you need to install Outlook first, and only then Active Sync. <br>  It turns out that there is a difference in what order to put the program ... damn it. <br><br>  Further more.  When I discovered two stylus in the box, I was surprised at first ... However, when one stuck inside me (a plastic piece broke on the stylus, for which you can pull it out of the slot), I folded all the mats by pulling it out of the girl with the forceps. <br><br><h1>  Tuning + Soft </h1><br>  After reading all the forums I ran into an interesting situation: many of those who have a Touch have a ‚Äúcut out‚Äù (or don't use) a cube, and those who do not try to put it in every possible way. <br><br>  I am quite satisfied with the Cube.  Although I use it only for quick access to your favorite contacts.  However, a number of other standard caused some disappointment.  In particular, a branded MP3 player is terrible: to understand in which order it will play songs and how well it is quite difficult to score a playlist into it. <br><br>  There were no problems with the software.  As for any Windows for WM6 software in bulk.  Skipping w3bsit3-dns.com.RU found the minimum that I need: <br><ul><li>  PocketMind PocketMusic - MP3 player replacement </li><li>  PocketCM Keyboar - a normal keyboard styled as a Touch </li><li>  GoogleMaps, just like that ... </li></ul><br>  When installing PocketMusic, it ‚Äúclogs‚Äù its place on the desktop, which makes it convenient to start-up. <br><br><h1>  the Internet </h1><br>  The Internet has the most problems.  When I turned on the Touch, I interviewed me in every way and I was absolutely sure that he would make all the settings himself.  Since I never used the Internet on my old phone, at first it seemed to me that my operator had a problem.  Megaphone for HTC Touch did not have the function of automatically setting up the Internet via SMS.  However, by inserting a sim card into another phone, I discovered that the Internet is working.  Then, I went to the nearest store selling my device (I was alone in the city) and asked to test their sales sample. <br><br>  The manager kindly removed the Touch from the shop window and gave it to me.  What was my surprise that as soon as I entered the connection parameters and inserted my SIM card, the Internet started working ... <br><br>  In general, I wandered home with great confidence that I slipped a gray device. <br><br>  Recalling the experience of setting up synchronization and the order of my actions with the store model, I took out the sim card from the communicator and made a hard reset to my little animal ... and then having scored all the wizards, WM6 entered the Internet settings manually.  After that, I inserted a SIM card (that's exactly what I did in the store, because at first I forgot about SIM) ... and lo and behold!  It all worked. <br><br><h1>  General impressions </h1><br>  In general, I am pleased with the device.  Yes, WM6 is on it and it is braking, it periodically hangs, but, it makes my life much easier and much more convenient than analogs.  Touch allows you to minimize the work with the stylus, however, it still sometimes have to get it.  And more often than desired. <br><br><h1>  PS iPhone C Comparison </h1><br>  When Apple dropped the price on the iPhone 4Gb, it became (there, of course) cheaper than some GSM phones.  I immediately caught fire his purchase, because  I have a relative in the states.  However, having studied its functionality more closely and comparing it with my own requirements + faced with the problem of possible repair (at that time, since this is not a problem now), I slowed down my fervor a little.  Finally my wife killed me ... <br><br>  This week was a chance to hold in the hands of the iPhone. <br><br>  To be honest, the first reaction was a big frustration: the device looked and worked better than in advertising: <br><ul><li>  no brakes </li><li>  smooth start of programs with cool effects </li><li>  really Easy control, with which you don't remember the stylus </li><li>  longer battery life (with a normal touch load, I hold for 1.5 days, and according to the iPhone owner‚Äôs statement it works for 3-4 days) </li></ul><br><br>  I shouldn‚Äôt have listened to anyone and bought what my heart was about, I thought ... as I walked home in my head I scrolled over plans to sell Tach .... <br><br>  However, after spending the evening thinking and more analyzing the iphones.ru forum, I came to the conclusion that it was too early ... <br><br>  What is missing from the iPhone? <br><ul><li>  No normal to-do, with the ability to synchronize </li><li>  no ability to edit text files </li></ul><br>  With my memory, I need a competent electronic organizer and, if I can justify buying the HTC Touch for myself, then the iPhone is not there yet ... <br><br>  Let's wait for the SDK ... <br><br><h1>  Pps </h1><br>  Read the news today: <br><blockquote>  The announcement of the search for an engineer to work in the iPhone development team, posted on the Apple website, indicates that the company intends to make every effort to promote its phone to corporate markets. <br><br>  The announcement says that Apple is looking for a motivated, highly qualified engineer who specializes in testing and data synchronization.  The main work of a potential employee of the company will be testing the interaction of the iPhone with Microsoft Outlook and Exchange software.  Apple may be working on ActiveSync support, which will synchronize data ‚Äî for example, emails, calendars, contacts, etc. ‚Äî between the iPhone and Microsoft Exchange servers. <br><br>  A few days ago, SAP announced that it would release a mobile version of its sales accounting automation software for the iPhone, and even earlier than for other communicators that traditionally have stronger positions in corporate markets - BlackBerry and Palm Treo.  According to SAP Vice President Bob Stutz (Bob Stutz), the company's own managers called the iPhone a simpler device to use, which prompted SAP to start working on the Apple phone software. <br><br>  Source: <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/">MacRumors</a> </blockquote><br>  <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/news/apple/index.shtml%3F09/79/17">www.ixbt.com/news/apple/index.shtml?09/79/17</a> <br>  If things go in this direction, the purchase of the iPhone will no longer look so rash. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17544/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17544/</a></p>
