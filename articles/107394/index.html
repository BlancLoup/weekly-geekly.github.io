  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social networks in business. Employee Conduct Policies</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  China, India, Facebook - this would be the three largest countries if Mark Zuckerberg was president and Facebook country, 24 hours video is uploaded to YouTube every minute, 3,600,000,000 photos were stored on Flickr.com back in 2008 year  There is a great influence that social networks have on our daily lives - Obama also has about 5,700,000 followers on Twitter, which is far from a record.  Two years ago, 93% of users thought that companies should be present on social networks, and preferably while interacting with <a href="http://ow.ly/2YiqN">customers</a> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  And, for example, in America, this happens very often - in Twitter alone, a bunch of <a href="http://twitter.com/">companies</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/">corporations</a> accounts, where with their help they engage in dialogue with users, support them, trying to answer questions and respond to comments as quickly as possible.  In this way, the problems of improving the image of the company are solved and a much greater efficiency of advertising new products and services is achieved, and all this at a low cost. After all, you just need to love your customers, know what to write, and be able to use TweetDeck or Hootsuite. <br><br>  I must say that in Russia companies are only just starting to come to an understanding of the need for working with social media.  So far, for the most part, only Twitter accounts can be observed, which are filled with the banal repost of company news from the official site using RSS, for example, one of the two largest exchanges is <a href="http://twitter.com/">doing</a> just <a href="http://twitter.com/">that</a> , plus companies use mass follower and purchase of followers.  In general, the situation is exactly this, although there are <a href="http://twitter.com/">exceptions</a> .

      Abroad, attention is paid not only to marketing, PR and other ways to promote in social media.  The behavior of company employees during their stay on social networks is also rather strictly regulated.  In particular, documents defining what employees can afford, and what is better not to have from <a title="Microsoft" href="http://socialmediagovernance.com/MSFT_Social_Media_Policy.pdf">Microsoft</a> , <a title="SAP" href="http://www.sapweb20.com/blog/2009/07/sap-social-media-guidelines-2009/">SAP</a> , <a title="Intel" href="http://www.intel.com/sites/sitewide/en_US/social-media.htm">Intel</a> , <a title="Nvidia" href="http://www.nvidia.ru/object/social-media-guidelines-ru.html">NVIDIA</a> <br>  and even at the <a title="Red cross" href="https://docs.google.com/View%3Fdocid%3Ddf4n5v7k_216g5jdd7c8%26hgd%3D1">Red Cross</a> and other <a title="Clinic" href="http://sharing.mayoclinic.org/guidelines/for-mayo-clinic-employees/">Mayo clinics</a> . <br><br>  Studying all the documents listed above, I noticed that the main points are in general similar, so you can make up some top recommendations that employees of large companies and corporations adhere to. <br><br>  So, what are the recommendations for behavior in social networks in general, given to their employees by large companies: <br><br>  <b>1. Write in the first person.</b> <br><br>  Remember that you are not a PR representative.  Therefore, write in the first person (‚ÄúI think ..‚Äù instead of ‚ÄúWe in% companyname% think ..‚Äù).  Respect private information and corporate information not intended.  for disclosure (release of new products, mergers / acquisitions, etc.).  If you post a message or comment on a website that is not related to% companyname%, please add a similar example: ‚ÄúPublications on this site are my personal initiative and do not necessarily coincide with the opinion of% companyname%, its strategy or express the company's position . ‚ÄùRemember, you can be held personally responsible for the content of your publications. <br><br>  <b>2. Write about what you understand.</b> <br><br>  If you write in your blog / microblog about work in% companyname%, then use your real name, clearly designate that you work in% companyname%, and clearly and clearly tell what your role in the company is. <br><br>  <b>3. You are part of a large organization.</b> <br><br>  Denoting yourself as an employee of the company you create an impression of your competence and in general about% companyname%.  Remember - what you say and write forms the image of the company. <br><br>  <b>4. Respect copyrights.</b> <br><br>  You must respect the intellectual property of others.  Never use more than just a small piece of someone else's work and make sure to mention the author and, if possible, post links to the original source. <br><br>  <b>5. Apply the "Rule Manager".</b> <br><br>  If you are going to type a comment or a blog post, and you have any doubts about whether or not to do this before discarding doubts and clicking ‚ÄúSend‚Äù, ask yourself: ‚ÄúIf my boss saw this, would I be embarrassed or is concerned? ‚ÄùIf after that you are still in doubt, it is better to discuss this issue with the public relations department or the legal department. <br><br>  <b>6. Do you have to register accounts in social networks on behalf of% companyname% or its subdivisions?</b> <br><br>  In general, company employees should not register such accounts on social networks, unless they are directly responsible for their presence in social media in their department and checked and made sure that such an account has not yet been registered.  If there is any doubt that this has already been done, then the account does not need to be registered. <br><br>  <b>7. Use conversational speech style.</b> <br><br>  Communicate with people in social networks and readers of your blog as you would talk to them in real life.  Show your individuality and personality.  Produce content that you would love to read. <br><br>  <b>8. Do you add value?</b> <br><br>  The best way for people to read what you write is to write interesting and valuable things.  Social relations with the public should improve the image of the company, build a sense of community - i.e.  help our customers, partners and colleagues. If you write something that allows people to improve their knowledge, skills, build their business, do their work, solve problems or understand our company better - then this is adding value. <br><br>  <b>9. Avoid confrontation.</b> <br><br>  The line between healthy dispute and provocation can be very thin.  Do not slander our competitors or% companyname%.  Similarly, there is no need to respond to every criticism or proclamation of the company, although, of course, when it comes to defamation, you can refute a deliberately false statement about our company. <br><br>  <b>10. Have you screwed up?</b> <br><br>  If you made a mistake, admit it.  Be honest and quick to fix it.  If you are editing an earlier blog entry, then let people know that you did it. <br><br>  You can debate on whether it is ethical for corporations to interfere with the personal lives of their employees, but on the other hand, those who work in large companies should have a sense of responsibility.  In general, the practice of introducing policies of behavior in social networks for employees is a good idea that helps to avoid <a title="SUP" href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ui_design_and_usability/105178/">such situations</a> . <br><br>  PS For the preparation of the article, in addition to the above documents, this list of <a href="http://socialmediatoday.com/ralphpaglia/141903/social-media-employee-policy-examples-over-100-companies-and-organizations)">companies</a> that have official documents on social media policies for employees was used. <br>  PPS The study of this topic has resulted for me in the creation of such a <a href="http://goo.gl/uhMD">document</a> and a <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/alexlashkov/social-media-5585234">presentation</a> for companies, and since I am for open source, I want to share all this good with the social community.  Accordingly, feedback, amendments, instructions and wishes are highly desirable, I will be very grateful). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/107394/">https://habr.com/ru/post/107394/</a></p>
