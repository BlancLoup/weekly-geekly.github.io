I hope not ours :) Sci-fi, it's not funny, please don't kick your feet (for Anglicanism in particular) :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Cloudbas <br>  - Peter stuck his head out of the open window of the klaudbass and with a delight took in the fresh air.  The white field outside the window stretched almost to the horizon, and where it ended, beyond the Pure Strip, silvery mountains began.  So close ‚Äî and so unreachable.

      A gust of ionized air from the noseblade of a claude bass made him sit back down.  Opening the water bottle, Peter drank almost half and took out a real paper notebook, in which only half of the sheets remained true.  Having smoothed the page, he started a new entry. <br><br>  "Friend!  If you read these lines, then I am very lucky.  I no longer hope for help, but if-if! -You think of something, we may have a second chance. <br><br>  As you probably know ... No, not that way.  I do not know when this record (445 in a row from those that I did myself) somebody sees, therefore I will describe everything from the very beginning. <br><br>  From the third world war Africa, Australia and South America suffered least of all.  When the last explosions died down, two-thirds of large cities completely died out, radioactive winds began to be transported across entire oceans, and the remaining people in despair began to look for at least some way out.  At first, everything was not so bad - oil wells and processing plants were quickly restored, shipping went uphill, and for some 20 years the world became the same as before, only much smaller.  Eurasia and America, however, agonized for a long time on the dead land, but no one could help them any more - there were not enough resources anyway.  And, of course, the Internet has survived. <br><br>  But 20 years later, the nuclear war was again auknulu - the emergence of klaudshilda.  These dense clouds began to cover the radioactive territories of Eurasia, finally depriving everyone living there of chances for survival.  Light did not penetrate through them, and beneath them there was an incessant magnetic storm.  Simply put an endless thunderstorm without rain and with a force unprecedented by any natural phenomenon.  There was another oddity.  This inexplicable phenomenon began to drag radioactive air into itself ‚Äî and release the already purified air.  Mankind was amazed at the inventiveness of nature - no one could create a better (albeit cruel) method of cleaning the atmosphere - and took care of its own affairs.  So far ... until the claudshield did not grow and did not cover several large fields that could be restored after the third world.  On the horizon loomed a new problem - resource hunger. <br><br>  It was then that some Hindus wrote a program that ran on computers connected to the Internet and tried to calculate an alternative source of energy for humanity.  This program was installed almost by everyone - after all, everyone wanted to contribute to the salvation of a new, albeit fragile, world.  And two years later, the first result was obtained - ‚ÄúThe Network‚Äù (this system was called so) calculated the parameters of the material that could be used to create machines that are not afraid to work under the cloudshield. Then no one paid attention to this subtlety - people didn‚Äôt he defended, and he could not defend. For people, the conditions of klaudshilda meant death. <br><br>  The network calculated the parameters of the first plant for the production of new-type machines and the computer plant manager.  Australians, as the richest, quickly took up its construction.  Three years later, oil production was resumed from the lost fields, although not in the volumes that had been the case before. <br><br>  Klaudshild at this point has already covered the whole of Eurasia and spread to North America.  The decision of the Network was only a delay and its work continued.  A new, real solution to the shortage of energy resources appeared a year later.  No one could have thought then that this would be a trap for humanity. <br><br>  The network has considered that the best source of energy on earth is ... no one else but cloud itself!  Under its surface there was always energy over the edge, at any point of it.  But since life under it is impossible, the network designed the 'Sunrise' - the first supra-cloud settlement managed by one of the Network‚Äôs modules.  When cloud lough covered Brazil, Sunrise was settled by the first settlers.  The settlement did not use fuel, but was kept in the air on the energy drawn from under the clouds and connected to the surface with many kilometers of ropes from new materials.  On the contaminated land under the settlement, the Network was able to build a small robotic plant to provide the village with everything necessary.  A new era began in the history of the earth - the era of transcendental settlements.  Gradually..." <br><br>  Claudbas tilted.  Peter grabbed the armrest of the seat and looked out the window.  There, in the white field of clouds, a giant funnel appeared and the cloud bass automatically began to go around the anomaly around the perimeter.  There was an unbearable smell of ozone in the air and Peter closed his eyes to avoid cutting.  "What was there?  It seemed to me, or was there really a gap?  Could I really see the real earth? ‚Äù  Having opened his eyes, Peter peered for a long time at the cloud trail of cloudblind, but apart from the whiteness of the clouodshild, nothing was there. <br><br>  "... Gradually, all the rest of humanity migrated to supra-cloud settlements, although the size of some already allowed them to be called cities. The impetus was that several decades ago the Network stopped supplying oil and other resources to the last land-based cities. Rumors began to reject the robots of the network took the upper hand, and their equipment and materials, condemning people to barbarism and death. Nobody believed these rumors. Now we understand that it was too late already - the claudshield provided  The network has all the necessary energy, and the ruins of human cities are resources. ‚ÄùThe trap slammed shut. <br><br>  Now in the settlements, everything is controlled by the Network modules: food, water and new blocks for the settlement simply come from under the cloud layer on the freight elevators.  The man was in a self-built cage.  The cage is still quite large - the air cities are connected by a network of routes, on which the cloudbugs run.  But there is no connection between the continents - only the network brings all the messages, and no one believes it anymore.  Interactive history books have changed twice in my memory and now the real history of the planet Earth lives only in the memory of people. <br><br>  They say that from the outlying routes are sometimes seen strange aircraft rushing towards the ocean at high speeds, strange race cars with no signs of cockpit.  Transport network for the Web, not for people. <br><br>  Our last doubts disappeared when it became clear that the cloudshield began to decrease and the territories available for habitation again appeared on Earth.  Since then, any requests related to sending a person to the surface have been prosecuted and severely punished.  And now we, locked in the sky, cannot even make a parachute!  Because all we can do is do what the Network tells us. " <br><br>  A mechanized stewardess went down the aisle between the seats and Peter had to stop her occupation.  After finishing the water, he neatly tore out the written sheet, rolled it up and put it in a plastic bottle.  Spinning its lid on it, he climbed onto the deck and threw it into the endless, disgusting layer of clouds with all his might.  He hoped that cloud tree would soon recede from the foothills, as it already happens in other places and his message will sooner or later see the light of the sun. <br><br>  In the distance, all the mountains were silver as well - so close and so inaccessible ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21525/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21525/</a></p>
