  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Godville. One year after habraeffekt</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Exactly a year ago, two young and naive comrades, in a desperate attempt to at least somewhere to attach kilograms of vain written and useless code, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_clever/29101/">put a link</a> to <a href="http://www.godville.net/">‚ÄúGodville - the city of gods and heroes‚Äù</a> on the famous Habrahabr resource.  The shy hope of being noticed and attracting at least two or three dozen users "for experiments" to the dying project suddenly justified with interest.  Having carried the post to the main page and desperately trying to register, the grateful computer community in passing almost brought down the green then still server.  The next day, the registration had to be closed, but over the past day the number of gods on the cloud increased by two orders of magnitude ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The following week was sleepless for us.  The code was written and optimized in huge chunks, in a matter of hours, fresh and very noticeable features were bolted onto the almost bare page of the hero.  On the third day, it was decided to finally put the player count online, and when he showed the first digit, his code was rechecked for a long time - the people hung in clusters.  A very successful idea was to open the ‚Äúbottom drawer‚Äù - a special form for quickly sending feedbacks directly from the main game page.  The popularity of this thing is such that in the coming years to bring all the ideas sent to us does not shine. <br><br>  Quickly optimizing the bottlenecks, but being in principle not ready for serious workloads, the core of the game had to be completely rewritten, for which a fair amount of autumn was spent.  From the simplest single-level ‚Äúvinaigrette‚Äù solution, a transition was made to the multi-level ‚Äúcomplex lunch‚Äù system, the most obvious and simple solution in which was to separate the user interface from the simulator of the game world.  The system is optimized and patched so far, as the load grows, the problematic components change and rewrite, making the entire resource most of the time still able to spin on a single <a href="http://godville.net/blog/post/20">budget server</a> .

      The attempt to support the initially completely free project with the donation system almost failed - for many months it was not possible to recoup even the above mentioned penny server.  As a result, in March of this year, the <a href="http://godville.net/blog/post/44">project</a> was still <a href="http://godville.net/blog/post/44">monetized</a> , which predictably stirred up the masses, but at least somehow covered the monthly expenses in the form of hosting and other things. <br><br>  In addition to the excellent start, which gave us the only post on Habr√©, we are extremely grateful to this resource for the "quality user".  The first portion of non-stupid players in the runet of people largely shaped the mood and set a certain level of quality for the content of the project - so far, despite the long-time open registration and periodic influx of doubtful masses, it is possible to maintain the inner world in fair condition. <br><br>  What do we have today?  The game project in the original genre, written in his free time, pretty overgrown with pleasant functionality, being at the stage of conditional payback and without any advertising attracting a solid number of people.  Judging by the reviews, many of the game have a very taste.  Future plans, in addition to the mandatory world domination, are the consistent implementation of a multi-page pile of new ideas. <br><br>  Thanks for attention.  The next post is in 2010. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64713/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64713/</a></p>
