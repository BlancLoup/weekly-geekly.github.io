    <h3>  Level 0 </h3><br><br><blockquote>  Hee-te-me-chago? </blockquote><br><br>  People at this level have never encountered HTML, except by mistake, for example, when they accidentally opened an HTML version of an email in text mode.  These people do not work in the web industry, and never will, therefore they have neither the reason nor the desire to rise above the zero level. <br><br>  Typical saying: <br><br><h3>  Level 1 </h3><br><br><blockquote>  Html?  These are such things to make the text zhirny or italic? <br></blockquote><br><br>  These people have been using the Internet for a long time and guess what is happening behind the scenes of the website they are currently viewing.  If you try to publish anything on the network, they are helpless without any WYSIWYG editor.  This could be Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Frontpage, or an editor embedded in the CMS, which they were told to use. <br><br>  People who maintain the content of a website are often at this level of skill, and some even claim that there is no need to strive to go up a step.  Many visual-oriented designers are firmly stuck on this level of their own accord, often defending their choice with the following: ‚ÄúNo one in the print world edits PostScript code manually, so why should the network be different?‚Äù Unfortunately, many project managers also rarely climb above the first level. <br><br><h3>  Level 2 </h3><br><br><blockquote>  The pages I make in Macromedia Dreamweaver work fine in Internet Explorer.  Why should I even look at this HTML? <br></blockquote><br><br>  At this level there are people who know enough about HTML to change, add or remove from the document a couple of tags (at this level, everything is called tags) that they know.  But they never have a particularly strong desire to dig into HTML. <br><br>  Second-level developers also consist of programmers who prefer the security of Visual Studio or any other IDE they use.  They think that HTML is too easy for them, and that their development environment is advanced enough to sort things out by itself.  Many second-level programmers are the target audience of CMS developers. <br><br><h3>  Level 3 </h3><br><br><blockquote>  Yes Yes.  I heard about these new tags: ul, li and all that.  But I get along well with my favorite table, img, br. <br></blockquote><br><br>  Many old school web developers who have been working in the industry since the late 90s can be found at this level.  Up until the end of the last century, these people wrote HTML manually, so they know all about nested tables and single-pixel GIFs.  Since then, WYSIWYG editors (such as GoLive and Dreamweaver) have improved to such an extent that third-level developers see no reason to know more about HTML.  Now, most of their work related to HTML is done in the design mode of their editor, so they would prefer to spend their time studying a particular application, rather than delving into what is happening behind its scenes. <br><br><h3>  Level 4 </h3><br><br><blockquote>  Listen, how can you make a table with data only div'ami and span'ami, not using the table ?! <br></blockquote><br><br>  At this level, people are beginning to consciously use doctype-s.  At the first stage, this is almost always a transitional doctype, more often XHTML 1.0 Transitional.  All the same, XHTML is a later specification than HTML, so it's probably better, right?  People at this level are also big fans of XHTML 1.1, naively believing that the older version implies some improvements. <br><br>  After hearing from someone that tables cannot be used for markup, many fourth-level programmers use divs to recreate table-like structure types.  So, the former tag-chefs become divomans who, day and night, produce tons of presentational markup with simple class names (red, blue, bigRedText, etc.) and inline CSS (style attribute). <br><br>  Most web developers who have reached the fourth level are ready to continue their education.  They understand that the methods that are promoted by the authors of blogs and books about web standards have an advantage.  But they still did not understand why these methods are better. <br><br><h3>  Level 5 </h3><br><br><blockquote>  I wonder what type of list will be used semantically more correctly in this passage of the document? <br></blockquote><br><br>  Most developers working in accordance with the canons of web standards can be found here.  These people, as a rule, first think about structure and semantics, and only then about representation.  At this level, strict doctypes are commonly used to encourage separation of semantic and presentational markup.  Whether it will be HTML version 4.01 or XHTML version 1.0 is not so important for many, although some fifth-level developers question the use of XHTML.  At the fifth level, people tend to breed endless discussions about the nuances of markup.  They can kill a few hours to come up with a name for the class or reorganize HTML and CSS files. <br><br>  If you reach this level, I think you already have some reason to be proud.  For most people, there is no compelling reason to climb higher. <br><br><h3>  <strong>Level 6</strong> </h3><br><br><blockquote>  I consider the HTML 4.01 and XHTML 2.0 specifications to be semantically limited.  Therefore, I am currently working on my own markup language. <br></blockquote><br><br>  These people are the wise men of our industry.  They spend a lot of time on things that will only be useful in the future, not right now.  The average developer will not be able to use the results of a significant part of their work for at least another five years. <br><br>  At the sixth level, you want more than just to earn a living by creating websites.  Instead, you can devote much effort to writing future specifications or interpreting browsers that already exist for developers. <br><br>  <em>Read the sequel <a href="http://chromice.habrahabr.ru/blog/38239.html">about CSS in the next section</a> .</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31475/</a></p>
