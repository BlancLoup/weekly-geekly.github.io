  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Open your Planet!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  ‚ÄúOpen your Planet!‚Äù Is the motto of the All-Russian Olympiad in the field of information technologies for students of higher and secondary educational institutions ‚ÄúIT Planet‚Äù.  Having made several search queries, I came to the conclusion that this event bypassed Habr.  As a participant, I want to tell you a little about the Olympiad itself, about how it was held this year, about the pros and cons of the organization.  <b>The topic will be interesting first of all to students who want to spend their free time with benefit.</b> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  About olympiad </h4><br><br>  So, a few years ago, this Olympiad was held only in the Krasnodar region.  Then the entire Southern Federal District participated.  And in 2009 she acquired the status of the All-Russian Olympiad.  The essence of the event is simple - the country's leading IT companies have united to identify advanced students all over Russia.  The public non-profit organization, the Association of Companies of Digital and Information Technologies, is in charge of all this business.  Among the major sponsors and partners are <i>Microsoft</i> , <i>Intel</i> , <i>Dlink</i> , <i>Linux Center</i> , <i>1C</i> , <i>Force</i> , <i>IT Co.</i> , <i>Red Keds Design Studio,</i> and others. Various IT companies from the regions were also noted. <br><br>  In the structure of the Olympiad there are 10 separate competitions: <br>  - competition <b>"Programming 1C: Enterprise 8"</b> <br>  - competition <b>"Programming DBMS ORACLE 10g"</b> <br>  - <b>Linux Administration</b> Contest <br>  - competition <b>"Technologies for Intelligent IT Systems"</b> <br>  - competition <b>"Administration of Windows Server 2008"</b> <br>  - competition <b>"Use of 1C: Accounting 8"</b> <br>  - competition <b>"Protocols, services and equipment"</b> <br>  - competition <b>"Graphics and Printing"</b> <br>  - competition <b>"Video and animation"</b> <br>  - competition <b>"Multimedia and Internet"</b>

      Accordingly, in the first stage, you can try your hand at any competition, but only one competition can be made basic.  On it you can go to the second round.  On each round, each competition is supervised by a separate IT company associated with this competition by the nature of its activities. <br>  The Olympiad begins at the beginning of the school year.  Information letters are sent to major educational institutions in the country.  Further, the educational institution must appoint a person responsible for the event, and all further work is carried out through it.  He registers an educational institution on the Olympiad website and notifies students about the event.  Further, the students themselves are registered on the site. <br><br>  On the appointed day, the first round begins.  It is by correspondence and consists in the participants passing the qualifying tests via the Internet.  In each competition, of course, presented a block of questions.  After some time, the results are posted on the site.  If you are on the list, then you are invited to the second round. <br><br>  Second round of the exit.  It usually takes place in the central city of the federal district.  Partners of the second round are regional companies and regional branches of large Russian companies. <br><br>  The third round (Final) is the most interesting.  This year they promised to hold it in the city of Sochi, but in the end they moved it to Moscow.  At this stage, the largest IT companies are involved in organizational participation.  They participate in the preparation of tasks.  They send their representatives to the event itself to hold contests and verify the results of the Olympiad.  Presentations of companies by their representatives are also possible, but this is already an ‚Äúoption‚Äù. <br><br><h4>  About the tasks of the Olympiad </h4><br><br>  As I said, the tasks are made by representatives of IT companies.  They then check the result.  Thus it is possible to hope that the tasks assigned to the participants of the Olympiad meet the current needs of the market. <br><br>  Below is a link to the office.  Olympiad site.  There anyone will be able to find approximate tasks of the second round over the past years.  I can additionally send tasks of this year on Windows Server 2008 (second and third rounds) and on Oracle (only third round). <br><br><h4>  About money </h4><br><br>  The question arises - where does the student take the money to come to full-time tours of the Olympiad?  As planned by the organizers, money for travel is provided by schools, or the student pays for travel himself.  In order to motivate educational institutions, thank-you letters and requests to send participants are sent to them.  Unfortunately, in our reality, things are not so simple: students have no money, but schools do not hurry to shell out.  Below I will touch on this problem. <br><br><h4>  About the 2009-2010 Olympiad and personal impressions </h4><br><br>  I participated in the contest "Administering Windows Server 2008".  The fact that I will write here and further will be suitable for the description of all competitions, but in some places I will proceed to the description of my own competition. <br><br>  I found out about the Olympiad by a color ad on the stand in my educational building (by the way, these announcements are also sent by the organizers to all educational institutions).  Further through the site, I found the person responsible in my UZ and met him.  After that I acted on my own, as the site contains all the instructions in detail. <br>  The first round took place in November 2009. Honestly, I helped Google with it.  But I am not ashamed to talk about it, because, as it seems to me, it is important not only to know the information, but also to be able to search for it quickly.  In the end, no one forbade google to other participants. <br>  The second round was not very remarkable, but without any problems.  The only disappointment is the organization of the event at the regional level (here we are talking about Khabarovsk).  I will also mention this problem below. <br><br>  As I said before - the highlight of the program is the Final.  This year it was held on April 21-22 in Moscow on the basis of the Academy of National Economy under the Government of the Russian Federation (ANE).  It took place in two days.  The first day is a trip to the Academy of National Economy, meeting with representatives of companies, and then directly holding competitions for the final round of the Olympiad.  Then the participants had a free program, and the organizers at this time checked the work.  By the way, the guys who participated in the contest "Technologies for Intelligent IT Systems" had a chance to visit the head office of Intel in Russia.  There they arranged a tour, fed and even gave something. <br><br>  Second day.  In the morning - presentations of companies: <i>Force</i> , <i>Linux Center</i> , <i>1C</i> , <i>Red Keds</i> .  After lunch, and even after the awards ceremony.  Modest prizes, certificates were awarded to participants and winners from the hands of company representatives.  Then closing and driving home. <br><br>  I personally went to Moscow for a lot of new impressions.  But as it turned out - this was not the end.  A few days after arriving home, I received an official invitation to visit the capital again.  This time, to visit the Svyaz-Expocomm 2010 exhibition and award the winners of the Olympiad in its framework with the Ministry of Communications of the Russian Federation.  It was a big stress for me to receive this invitation.  We had a lot to do in a short time.  But in the end - I visited the exhibition, visited the Ostankino TV tower (this is a gift from the Ministry of Communications) and spent several more wonderful days in Moscow. <br><br><h4>  About the pros </h4><br><br>  One of the most important advantages is the large scale of this event.  This is a unique opportunity to test your strength and express yourself for those people who do not know how to do it differently.  Personally, the Olympics prompted me to action and this action was crowned with success. <br>  In addition, there is a unique opportunity to visit the central part of Russia (I've never been to Moscow before, and here twice a month). <br>  The main thing is not to sit at home, but to work on yourself, then it is possible to achieve a lot. <br>  By the way, next year the organizers plan to attract the participation of the CIS countries, and the Olympiad will be released, possibly already at the international level. <br><br><h4>  About cons </h4><br><br>  There are, of course, the Olympiad and many drawbacks, but the organizers are working to eliminate them, and there is still something to strive for in the Olympiad.  I will give a list of the main problems that I have noticed: <br><br>  1) <i>The problem is in people</i> .  Not all people, of course, are meant.  I mean people in schools.  If the letters from the organizers come in the name of an inert person, then the active participation of the university in the Olympiad is out of the question.  Unfortunately, there are a lot of inert people now. <br><br>  2) <i>The problem is money</i> .  As I said, the organizers do not pay for the trip (only a small part).  And some educational institutions do not seek to send their students.  This is the problem of our education.  Fortunately, I didn‚Äôt have such a problem, but I know examples when people were either not given any money at all or given, but with a big delay. <br><br>  3) <i>Problems of organization at the regional level</i> .  Of course she suffers.  She is somewhat muddled.  Often nobody knows anything concrete.  Sometimes it seems that it was not worth going at all.  We must deal with this. <br><br>  4) <i>Informational problems</i> .  This year disappoint the Olympiad site and the organizers recognized this problem.  The site is almost not updated.  However, communication with the organizers via email saved the situation.  Sometimes there was even outright misinformation.  The site must of course also be updated more often. <br><br>  5) <i>Problems with technology</i> .  The main problem with technology is obsolete technology in most educational institutions in the country.  In this regard, I was pleased with PNU in Khabarovsk.  There, everything was fine with the technique.  But in the ANX there was clearly not enough power for the normal performance of certain tasks. <br><br>  6) <i>Problems with tasks</i> .  In the first round, some tasks contained frank errors.  In the second round, the tasks were generally normal, but in my opinion somewhat light.  At the end of the assignment there were several non-Olympiad profiles (these were Microsoft laboratory work).  With the preparation of tasks, in my opinion, there is still a lot of work.  It is good that the participants of the past years are included in this business (I have already read a lot of criticism from them on many portals). <br><br>  7) <i>Informational problem</i> .  This is another big problem - it lies in the fact that many still do not know about this event.  But this problem, in my opinion, will be solved with time.  Partly for the contribution to the solution of this problem this topic was written. <br><br><h4>  About links </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://www.planet-it.ru/">www.planet-it.ru</a> - the official website of the Olympiad, there is everything you need to get started.
