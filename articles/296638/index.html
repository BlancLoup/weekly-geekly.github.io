    </i>  <i>John Drake has worked in marketing and advertising for 19 years.</i>  <i>He currently holds the position of vice president of brand strategy planning at Drake Cooper, where he leads all brand strategies for agency clients.</i>  <i>Drake Cooper is an advertising and digital agency that has been recognized for three years in a row as the ‚Äúbest place to work‚Äù, where they use their own strategic development tool called Campaign Planning.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>John previously worked at WONGDOODY and Deutsch LA.</i>  <i>His clients include such famous brands as Baskin Robbins, DirecTV, Tillamook Cheese, Carl's Jr.</i>  <i>and nestle.</i> <br><br>  ___________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br><br>  <b>You are the largest advertising agency in Idaho with a presence in the Pacific and Northwest regions.</b>  <b>Reveal the secret, how does this affect your media buying vision?</b> <br><br>  We need to keep a special focus on accurate geo-targeting.  We have customers who need to target the target audience only in certain states, cities or even by zip code.  Other needs must be imposed on these needs, such as the lifestyle and behavior of Central Asia.  When you buy nationally, there are many options.  But when you need to really limit your spending on narrowly targeted areas, you need to take the choice of media very seriously. <br><br>  <b>Share, are there things that you would have done differently than, say, an agency that primarily deals with the purchase of national media?</b>  <b>What strengths can you highlight with a trump card of local presence?</b> <br><br>  Here, first of all, it is a matter of team unification: media and creativity.  This is beneficial for clients, because these teams will be barred together and work side by side, and our presentation to clients looks holistic.  But for a national buying agency, it is very difficult to establish such a process of relationships with a creative team.  And the result, when these departments are not connected with each other, is inefficiency and missed opportunities. <br><br>  <b>There are many different definitions of media buying programmatics, however, we are curious to know your personal one.</b> <br><br>  Advertising, which is individually selected for each person, therefore, has less losses. <br><br>  <b>Tell us, based on the experience of your own agency, about the ways of obtaining maximum efficiency and scaling that programmatic offers?</b> <br><br>  The fact that the audience can be mixed with the programmatic gives a great opportunity.  The combinations of demographic and behavioral targets are limitless and can be tested against each other.  This is where we look for new solutions with our programmatic teams.  We speak affectionately about this way of mixing audiences with ‚Äúturquoise audiences‚Äù: take some blue, some green, etc., and then find the perfect mixes of relevant audiences for the brand. <br><br>  <b>Do you think that the programmatic had any impact on direct purchases from publishers / networks, and as the programmer develops, will personal relationships be less and less important?</b> <br><br>  I think they, on the contrary, are becoming increasingly important.  Programmatic is great, but having a unique and unconventional brand presence on prominent publisher sites provides an excellent opportunity.  Programmatic allows the brand to see what works best.  Then we can take this best, approach the choice of publishers correctly, and work on building a brand experience that will even be more relevant for their audience in conjunction with our brand.  We are committed to direct purchases from publishers.  Maybe someday the programmatic will become more important, but for now, the dialogue between people really helps to create something unique and relevant for each publisher. <br><br>  <b>What do you think of the programmatic video?</b>  <b>What differences do you see between programmatic video buying and live video streaming from publishers?</b> <br><br>  He is competitive.  We find both of these tools successful and in the future we will continue to use them. <br><br>  <b>Do you think the scope and efficiency that programmatic provides outweigh the potential concerns about transparency, visibility, and the lack of premium inventory?</b> <br><br>  Not.  Programmatic can be achieved with very effective brand spending, but these problems still exist.  We are at a very early stage of development of programmatic, and I hope that over time we will have improvements in this area. <br><br>  <b>What recommendations could you give to small or specialized agencies for better use of programmatic?</b> <br><br>  Find a way to bring the possibilities of programmatic to the "home".  To possess this data and insight in close access is extremely beneficial, because then it becomes possible to immediately inform and influence the choice of creativity and media.  Whether it is a campaign created on time or implemented improvements, you can perform analysis without waiting for the data. <br><br>  <b>How do you see the development of programmatic in the next 5-10 years?</b>  <b>Will specialized, regional, small and media buying agencies take it as the main tactic?</b> <br><br>  We combined programmatic with a scheduling account as we did with media.  Users are becoming more demanding, which challenges the industry to improve visibility (for ease of perception), and programmatic is becoming an increasingly important tool for the development of a messaging strategy.  So, perhaps in 5-10 years it will not be just a media tactic, but will grow into a useful resource for the development of brand strategy and brand management. <br><br>  <i>Drake Cooper is an ambitious advertising agency.</i>  <i>Providing services such as design, advertising, digital and media buying services, the agency has been recognized as the ‚Äúbest place to work‚Äù for three consecutive years by national media, and is one of the most creative agencies in the north-west that has received awards in the field of creative development.</i> <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296638/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296638/</a></p>
