  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Employees and business: and not a friend, and not an enemy, but how?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Business got carried away, and it became alarming.  Neural networks, blockchain, machine learning, robots, automation of everything and everyone created a dangerous illusion that everything has been solved.  So, you can dismiss, reduce, not hold, not motivate.  What for?  Part of the cost is saved due to the introduction of automation, and for those working capacity that remained, there are queues of applicants, why hold on to someone.  This is not utopia, it is our reality with which we enter the new 2018 year.  And it, this reality, should not be.  Because behind every technology there are people behind, behind every company and behind every product of the company there are people, and the owners of the companies are also people.  Four days before the new year, we want to talk about how a business can get along with employees, and employees - with a business.  After all, we still can not exist without each other.  Therefore, let's talk - as people with people.  About people. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/345728/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b48/909/ec0/b48909ec0a223f3fd13f9d2d83ba5e90.png"></a> <br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Source: Yandeks.Kartinki</i></font> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">Why do we care?</font> </h2><br>  For 11 years we have been developing <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/">RegionSoft CRM</a> and a lot of different business software.  When we entered the market, we were moved by an important emotion - we created software that would help businesses and make their lives easier.  It never even occurred to anyone that software - the usual set of commands, logic + interface - is designed to replace a person.  However, not everyone had such a setup - the fear that the ACS (CRM) would replace a person was still in Soviet times: it was terrible to read the stories of the first automated control systems that were boycotted by the smartest engineers and employees of enterprises so as not to lose their jobs.  After all, this didn‚Äôt just reduce productivity; it threw progress in different areas just a few years ago: in the main sphere of the enterprise, in software development, in working with iron PCs (if there is no powerful software, why bother with a good PC?). <br><br>  Well, it was, and passed, now everything is different.  No, and now it is no different - the vendors themselves and company executives find it one of the motives for implementing CRM / ERP and other business automation to be precisely the opportunity to ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù the state.  Simply put, cuts, and with the mentality of our business - layoffs.

      Of course, these are unfair judgments.  CRM-ki and other business software are needed only in order to release workers from nervousness, routine and the need to keep everything in your head and uncomfortable files.  Then the workers, having experience and understanding of the company's features and business, will be able to do what they cannot (and will not learn a hundred in the next few years!) To make machines - to think, reason and think abstractly.  Create new products, models of promotion, research, interpret data and so on.  That is, to work intellectually and intensively, and not on the thumb: <i>coffee - report - meeting - lunch - letters, calls, work, letters - tea - all for now, until tomorrow.</i> <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">I do not touch her!</font>  <font color="#cc0000">Everything is in place</font> </h2><br>  Automation is just one of the reasons that business has started to pay more attention not to people, but to infrastructure.  But in fact, there are more reasons, and they are different, disguised and obvious.  Relationships can deteriorate, and problems emerge in any companies - even those that have proclaimed a person the center of the business world, take care of employees, lure them on the most delicate terms, etc.  And here are the main causes of conflicts, misunderstandings and crises in the company. <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Burnout specialists.</b>  The work of each of us is extremely intensive - no one is surprised, seeing in the reports on working time many hours of processing, which is not paid and motivated by nothing but the enthusiasm of the employee or his loyalty and readiness to work ‚Äúfor the idea‚Äù.  If you do not note such tendencies, brush them off, the employee will experience emotional burnout - he simply will not understand whether his work is noticed or not. <br></li></ul><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>An example from life.</b></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">An analyst in one of the companies came up with a new way of calculating affiliate rewards and in the evenings ‚Äúsawing‚Äù a template file with formulas and macros so that his colleagues could enter data into the cells and get a result.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">As the budgeting period went, he did it in the evenings.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Once in a conversation with the manager, he sighed without a hint of anything, that it had already been a month at almost midnight.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The manager‚Äôs response was: ‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre working badly, since you don‚Äôt have time to do everything in working time.‚Äù</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The file has been completed.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The analyst withered and left the company after 11 months.</font></i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Squabbles and intrigues at work</b> - these phenomena are dangerous not only for their manifestations, but also for their reasons.  Often the roots of harassment, intrigue, boycotts grow on the basis of the desire to oust a strong employee from a uniform team, so that no one can show that you can work better. <br></li><li>  <b>Irritation of leadership on the background of insufficient profits.</b>  I hope that now no one will round his eyes, having learned that the leaders of all companies always strive to make a profit.  And even (especially) those companies in which the most chocolate conditions, games, hammocks and offices are of the highest class - after all, all investments in an office, headhunting, high salaries are nothing more than an investment in order to get more return (revenue).  And if managers do not see the desired numbers, they "do not iron" the managers lower, and those - the rest of the staff.  The overall tension is growing significantly. <br></li><li>  <b>The reluctance of management (from project managers to tops and CEOs) to get into the essence of processes and work.</b>  It is from this position that conflicts arise with incorrectly set plans, deadlines, and tasks.  It is impossible to consider work within the company in a vacuum, in isolation from the state of affairs in the industry, in the market, in the country.  This is fraught with the fact that people simply choose more adequate bosses. <br></li></ul><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>The story of life.</b></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The head of the sales department came to the ACS department.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">He needed unloading in two years for all sales and some transactions (about 7 million records) in a certain section.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The programmer asked for the TK and the permission of the security service, since the data were of the highest commercial value.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Unloading for those times would take 6.5 hours.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The salesman stamped his feet and shouted that he had to report to him in 15 minutes.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">I wrote three reports - on SQL-Shchik, Sat-Schnick and the head of the development department.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The deputy director, far from the real affairs of the lady, stuck "guilty" and drove a minus into the KPI.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Until it reached the competent Commerce, nerves all worn out.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Since then, all salespeople began to suffer - even the smallest request that remembers the history of programmers performed only according to TK and with the agreement.</font></i> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Awful material base.</b>  Employees of many companies are working on old blinking LCD shki (fortunately, CRT has almost never been seen).  And in the same place, in the system units with these monitors old processors are warming.  And okay, if it costs OS Windows XP - it was beautiful, and some employees themselves are against the update, and if this is Windows 2000?  Or, for example, employees for whom office applications are the main work tool are forced to work in Open / Libre Office.  And all this against the background of traffic restrictions of 300 MB per person (the real figure of the IT company).  And most importantly, the majority of employees have something to compare with - normal cars are at home. <br></li><li>  <b>Industry causes</b> - events that cause workers a lot of stress.  Depends on the industry.  For example, competition, new laws, regulations and changes, requirements. <br></li></ul><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>A good example: about</b> 3-4 years ago, one company uploaded 2000 banners with Google advertising in 7 languages ‚Äã‚Äãto Google, and a few days later Google rolled out the rules on frames and backgrounds.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">In the New Year can not be left without shows.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Bottom line: two days in the office, three nervous breakdowns, one dismissal.</font></i> <br><br>  It happens that on a relatively flat background of office life, uncontrollable processes begin to unfold, which lead to dire consequences.  And then the participants do not find any other words, except as ‚Äúenrages,‚Äù ‚Äúgot it all,‚Äù ‚Äúe ... go, let's knit it all.  Let's try to find some tips that will help business and employees to hear each other. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">What should not and what should a business do?</font> </h2><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Business must</font> </h3><br>  <b>Pay money.</b>  It seems an obvious rule, which is the fulfillment of the requirements of the Labor Code.  It is important to pay according to merit and result.  Yes, of course, designer A and designer B or programmer A and programmer B may receive different salaries in the same project, but the remuneration should be determined not by the period of work in the company, not by the relationship with the manager, but by the result and quality of work.  Paying just for the nominal experience and for the nominal length of service is fraught. <br><br>  <b>Thank for the work.</b>  Money alone is not enough, and for some employees it is generally not the main driving force for first-class work.  Intangible and material non-monetary motivation must necessarily be - a person must feel his need, involvement in a common cause, a measure of assessment of his professionalism.  The non-recognition of the merits of a person causes stress, which gradually develops into depression, against the background of which the body functions are weakened and the efficiency decreases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e52/b1f/2b6/e52b1f2b674154b7efd688089efc2b88.png"><br><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>We conducted a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/332800/">survey about the motivation</a> and needs of employees.</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>So, at the beginning of a career, people are most concerned about becoming them as professionals and having at least some work in order to gain experience.</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>But over time, requests change, but nevertheless professionalism lags behind only three votes from wages.</i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>And, as you can see, an interesting project is important for almost 64% of respondents.</i></font> <font color="#999999"><i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc5/758/b3f/bc5758b3f1aa6669d4f2bfc9ab3a8bc9.png"></i></font> <br><br>  In general, working with a motivation system is the most important factor in the company's survival on the market, since it is easier to retain an employee.  If a specialist has such bonuses as a good team, thanks to the management and the awareness of their usefulness and their role in a particular project, it is difficult to lure him even with big money.  A professional feels like a professional not only by the card balance, but also by the number of solved problems and by the quality of the project. <br><br>  This is what Habr's users have chosen as a priority among non-financial motivation.  Be sure to review the results and try to implement these elements within the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c10/bac/46a/c10bac46abed04e009b4ff661a4f8328.png"><br><br>  <b>Develop a corporate culture.</b>  Now there is just a wave of corporate events and all companies strive to look original or correspond to employees (for example, IT people organize beer parties with bowling, and PR agencies sing karaoke).  But this is not a corporate culture in the way in which it should be.  Events, especially not forced, it's fun and cool, but the trick is not in them.  It is important to develop a corporate spirit - a spirit of support, professionalism, mutual help and healthy irony.  If corporate culture becomes noticeable, it is already kitsch or show-off.  Everything must be organic: love for the company and its projects, corporate pride, workplace culture, conflict management.  And no HR service will be able to hide the problems behind soft ottomans and vases with fruit, unless the same spirit is formed in which the team and individualists alone are comfortable. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e63/b16/7a8/e63b167a888dee3c48499fa6c44e9776.png"></div>  <font color="#999999"><i>Sometimes an employee is motivated against all odds</i></font> <br><br>  <b>Be in touch with employees.</b>  Yes, in small business this task seems feasible, on average and large it is necessary to look for options.  But in fact, this is not so difficult: you can conduct joint brainstorming sessions, write notes on the corporate portal or chat, mark achievements and honestly criticize the facts, allow writing questions and problems in the public domain (on the same portal), arrange meeting  Sometimes directors of large companies get special cases for calls or allocate receiving / bell hours.  Particular attention should be paid to this issue if you have a distributed team or part of the state working remotely.  With all the delights of the remote and work away from the authorities, remotes as team members are single people who often lack communication, support and approval.  Try to work in this direction. <br><br>  All employees in the office and outside it should have a sense of unity of the whole team, a sense of hearing and support.  But at the same time, it‚Äôs not worth turning the work into a family - sooner or later this will lead to family quarrels :-) There is one thing here - you need to avoid the personality cult of a single person, be it a technological evangelist or the owner of a company.  A true leader is always the first among equals. <br><br>  <b>Be involved in the work, but not excessively.</b>  The head of the company (as well as the entire top management) should not be removed from business by ‚Äúwedding generals‚Äù who are interested only in endless reports and profit margins.  A real leader, a leader and a businessman, must develop together with the team and the product, understand industrial and commercial matters.  Firstly, it will protect it from deception and fraudulent proclivities from employees and partners, and secondly, it will allow working effectively with the strategy and seeing all the gaps and needs of the market first. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/361/b64/d70/361b64d701f4e052ab4a98cb89d2919a.jpg"></div><br>  <font color="#999999"><i>Here's a crib for you:</i></font> <font color="#999999"><i><br><br></i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>smart chef + smart subordinate = profit</i></font> <font color="#999999"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>smart chef + stupid subordinate = performance</i></font> <font color="#999999"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>silly boss + intelligent subordinate = promotion</i></font> <font color="#999999"><i><br></i></font>  <font color="#999999"><i>stupid chef + stupid subordinate = eternal processing and the shaft of affairs</i></font> <br><br>  But at the same time there should be no micromanagement - that is, presence in all processes and in all workplaces at once.  It is important to find a balance between delegating tasks and controlling processes from the outside.  Micromanagement can only lead to irritation and nervousness in the team. <br><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>An example from life.</b></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">In one company with a 25-year history, there was (and is) a manager at the age of 60, a talented engineer and scientist in his time.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">At some point, he decided that he no longer included in the development process, but sat in his mega office with palm trees and a portrait (no, they did not guess - himself).</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">And so the company went business is bad-preploho, commerce slipped.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">And he hired for several days anti-crisis consultant.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">But he also did not turn out to be a blunder - and he began <s>not to move the beds, but to fell on the girls</s> from testing the product.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Everything was discovered: from empty modules to crash base and inefficient sales.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Employees simply received a salary and posted in the social.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">networks ode to the bronzed director.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Deal with labor, but managed to fix it - at least to avoid ruin.</font></i> <br><br>  <b>Accept criticism.</b>  This is, in fact, very difficult, but on the other hand, it is the working dialogue - perhaps the most significant factor in normal relations within the company.  No matter how much you are bursting with pride in your work, be sure to listen to the employees, because you hired them for the sake of professionalism and experience.  Arrange discussions, get a bugtracker (not even the developers!) And accept complaints and suggestions, respond to them, change the status of the task.  Heard employee = loyal employee, remember this. <br><br>  <b>Implement KPI.</b>  Around the very topic of KPI in business, serious passions are boiling and a lot of corporate blood is shed.  If you do not develop KPI yourself, but assign it to a group of employees, then try to include representatives of all departments in the group.  This is what happens if ‚Äúmatrices‚Äù are made by groups: <br><br><ul><li>  lobbying the interests of individuals and departments <br></li><li>  the inclusion in the calculation system of strange subjective coefficients, which can be described as "two for behavior" <br></li><li>  distribution of the bonus fund within a narrow group in collusion. <br></li></ul><br>  This is hardly what you want from the reward system.  Design KPIs really attached only to official duties, make the coefficients understandable, accessible and transparent, exclude any subjectivity.  By the way, we wrote a <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/regionsoft/blog/308800/">large and very intelligible article</a> about KPI. <br><br>  <b>Giving a sense of security.</b>  Your employees need to know that work is their defense and the stone wall in a crisis, in a downturn and even in default (pah-pah-pah).  They should not sit like on a volcano and constantly wait for dismissal.  Demonstrate success, show failures, explain to the staff a plan for further actions - they have to believe in you, but at the same time understand that the company's future depends a lot on how well they work.  Try not to cross the line between partnership and coaxing - ‚Äúcoaxing‚Äù can give rise to uncomfortable and whining idlers inside the team. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6c3/3ec/324/6c33ec324ecbc1904ebc21ac88300ae2.png"></div>  <i><font color="#999999">Everyone stay in the workplace, it's Monday!</font></i> <br><br>  <b>Promptly respond to employee problems.</b>  We emphasize on <i>any</i> problems of employees.  If problems are working, then they need to be solved in working order.  If personal - then you should not try to correct or persuade something - as a rule, it helps badly in trouble.  But you need to establish the exact cause of employee failure and propose a solution: change the work time, schedule, conditions, or offer an extraordinary vacation.  Believe me, after recuperating and correcting the situation, the employee will answer you with maximum loyalty.  Therefore, if your best manager has suddenly ceased to sell, and a brilliant programmer commits a huge code, do not rush to make trouble and dismiss, deal with the problem.  Most likely, it is solved in the nearest time interval. <br><br>  <b>Work with the organization of the work environment.</b>  This point is often either exaggerated or completely overlooked.  Set priorities correctly: so, a good and modern computer for an employee is more important than seven coffees in the kitchen, and a comfortable and ergonomic chair is more necessary and more valuable than a dozen ottomans and a hammock.  Just think: the most comfortable should be the place where the employee spends the most time.  Pay attention to the noise in the office, the need for workers in the partitions, the organization of food and travel, if there are any difficulties with this.  The office should be comfortable, and the situation should be primarily working. <br><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>Tragicomic example of life.</b></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The company moved to a new office.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">In the toilets on the stalls, the doors were not deaf, but left a large gap above the floor and in front of the ceiling.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">In short, perfect hearing and even partial visibility.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Employees wrote a massive request to lengthen or change the door.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">They were denied.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The request was repeated again and again.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Within two months, three employees left - for this very reason, they were terribly uncomfortable, and for one of them this story simply became the last straw.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Naturally, the good guys left, or rather those who were quickly and easily taken by competitors.</font></i> <br><br>  <b>Provide opportunities for career growth or horizontal movements.</b>  Everything is as simple as possible: a good and capable employee must grow.  Be sure to enter in the staffing positions of "senior" and "leading", it will give you some room in making decisions about promotion.  In this case, do not devalue posts and do not distribute them to everyone in a row - this reduces the significance of success and kills the desire to grow to a certain level.  Notify about all promotions by order, which is sent to the post office or posted on the corporate portal - this is protection from individuals who like to take over the positions themselves. <br><br>  <b>Horizontal movements</b> are also the most important opportunity to save an employee.  Provide an internal mentoring system and allow the employee to move within the company.  If, for example, in the current position, he has exhausted his potential or has not taken root in the team. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#cc0000">Business should not</font> </h3><br>  <b>To breed an army of managers.</b>  Especially in small companies, when a situation often arises, that there are three superiors for one tortured subordinate.  Managing managers should be at an expedient minimum - just to be responsible and organize the work.  At the same time, it is necessary to hint at all this commanding fraternity that to be a leader does not mean watching videos on YouTube or reading Facebook, it is to work efficiently, quickly and a lot, as well as to be competent in almost all issues related to your activities. <br><br>  <b>Solve all problems with bonuses and promotions.</b>  Material motivation, although it hits the pocket, is still the easiest way to keep an employee.  They quarreled - the prize, I wanted to quit - they raised the wages, offended - the envelope, etc.  The result is a fascinating game of outbidding, industrial blackmail and skillful weaving of intrigue.  The principle is simple: bonuses and salary increases should occur only on the basis of a real result.  However, sometimes it is worth admitting that you have not indexed your salary for too long and the employee hints at dismissal only to raise this issue.  Do not bring to this - even a small salary increase gives a long-term surge of working enthusiasm. <br><br>  <b>Allow favoritism.</b>  It's horrible.  No, THIS IS HORRIBLE.  You just have to say no to favorites and other people close to you, do not burn the fire under your own feet.  First of all, remember: your confidant quietly let loose your secrets and secrets over a cup of tea.  Yes, you never admit to yourself that you have approached a person just because he informs you at all.  But most often it happens.  It is not worth such an awareness of the price that you pay for it.  And of course, it is not necessary to single out people who work as a medium, but at the same time like to create fun, sow positive and treat everyone with lemon cakes with cinnamon and vanilla cream.  This is their survival strategy, sincerity does not smell there.  Although a person is weak, and rarely does a leader know how to avoid falling prey to a flattering and such sweet snitch.  In short, no bitches at work! <br><br>  <b>Restrict access to the Internet.</b>  Are you laughing  In vain.  This problem flourishes with wild color: the traffic is cut off, the speed is reduced, explanations are written for each visited site.  Not worth it.  If a person can work well while watching Dudya at work - for God's sake, relax and work.  If an employee does not know how to prioritize, then circumcision of the Internet will not help - he can read a book from the monitor, chat with colleagues or friends, stick into a mobile phone.  He will still find his source of procrastination.  Therefore, we need other measures of motivation and censure. <br><br>  As you can see, the entire list is reduced to not being fired and retained while there is a chance to retain the employee.  Yes, you can say that now the queue of candidates, but how many among them fit?  Very few, critically few.  You once hired an employee, trained him, got you up to date, he is familiar with the business, so it‚Äôs even more profitable for you to keep someone who is already working, than to train a beginner, and even worse to pay recruitment agencies for cats in a bag.  Yes, and any dismissal causes a certain resonance in the team. <br><br>  <i><font color="#999999"><b>The story of life.</b></font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">In a big well-known company, there was a careless financier - a guy who did nothing and could not do anything.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">He worked by some miracle for about five years.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Then one day his new manager asked the general what the slacker was doing in the office.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">The General replied shortly: ‚ÄúI am ashamed that he will go somewhere to get settled, and he has our company in the resume.</font></i>  <i><font color="#999999">Than to have such an image, it is better to keep it with you. ‚Äù</font></i>  The same motive, you can not argue. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#cc0000">What should not the employee do?</font> </h2><br>  <b>First and foremost, the employee should not climb into the business.</b>  That's right - "do not go into the business."  That is, it is absolutely correct to discuss (and condemn, and dispute) decisions within the company; it is important to argue with the boss competently and reasonably, criticize and propose something.  But phrases like ‚ÄúHe knows how, I would have bought a third villa in Nice in his place‚Äù are untenable and destructive.  You feel the strength to open a business, recruit people, conduct business, pay taxes, fight off controlling organizations - go earn a villa.  No - do not say the words that will give you a cheap image of the office "brave" in front of colleagues.  And there is the only reason why you do not have the right to make such statements - you do not know all the features and nuances of each particular company.  Employees do not always know.  Even the most intelligent and perspicacious. <br><br>  <b>An employee should not be a "rat" in every sense of the word.</b>  Once, I got into the hands of a translated article in a business magazine about how cool it is to have rats in a company and how cool it is to be - this is supposedly the front of competition, and a fruitful struggle, resulting in productivity growth, and effective leveling. leaders.  And indeed, some advanced Russian companies have adopted this trend.  Moreover, competition actually increases productivity, but ... for a very short time.  Employees get tired of proving something and dig the ground with their noses, while the rat makes a career at the expense of krysyatnichestvo.  And then the performance drops, and anxiety increases, and the best ones leave.  Why leave the best?  Because they have the strength and ability to find a new job. <br><br>  Again, another aspect of the rat is theft in special office forms: the sale of licenses / goods to the left, kickbacks, collusion, theft of the client base, contractual transactions, etc.  It so happens that an employee, receiving an official salary, under the roof and at the expense of the company's image, without producing anything, gets a good income.  This is not entrepreneurial ability and not commercial talent - it is ratking. <br><br>  <b>The employee should not lie.</b>  We all lie - any employees and in any companies.  We embellish the achievements and we scribble a little in numbers.  And there is nothing criminal in this.          ,      ,   ,     .     ‚Äî          .   ,    . <br><br> <b>          .</b>      .        .     ,            . ,   ,       ‚Äî       ‚Ä¶ <br><br> <b>   .</b>       .   ‚Äî  ,  ‚Äî   ,  -  ‚Äî .          ,  :      .        . <br><br> <b>    .</b> ,    ‚Äî    .     <s></s>  ,       -.        . :   ¬´¬ª      ,     ,     . <br><br> <b> ,  <u></u> ( , )      .</b>    ,   .  ,    ()      ,     .   ,            . ,       ¬´,      ¬ª       ,   ,    .       ‚Äî   . <br><br> ,    ( ,  )     / ,   ,    ,      ,   ,    .     ,          , , .       ‚Äî   . <br><br><hr><br>       2017 .            .     <a href="http://www.regionsoft.ru/"></a>     ,      2018 ,  ,        ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/345728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/345728/</a></p>
