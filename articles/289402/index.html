If all of this information around digital nomads gives you the impression that in the web area, the employment model as such has started to move steadily somewhere - you are not far from the truth.  It happens every day ‚Äî the digital nomad community is growing, gaining momentum, and helping more and more freelancers, entrepreneurs, and start-ups do the work and create successful online products remotely, often while traveling the world. <br><br>  If, watching this phenomenon, you think that it is not about you - you are mistaken.  Thoughts that "they are good, they are lucky!" - not the best explanation. <br><br>  According to Kavi Gupta (Forbes author, nomad), ‚Äúno other generation had such freedom in creating and shaping their own way of life.‚Äù  This is not ‚Äúgood for them, they are lucky!‚Äù, This is ‚Äúwe are all lucky!‚Äù <a name="habracut"></a>

      Why am I leading all this?  In this article I want to touch on some of the excuses that we - designers, developers, founders of startups - like to invent as a barrier to the way of life that we would like to lead.  Briefly about me: I am a <a href="https%253A%252F%252Ftwitter.com%252Fsimpleasthat_%26sa%3DD%26sntz%3D1%26usg%3DAFQjCNFcT6Jb-Tvz7axzs1s6T6x0FqLQTA">UX designer</a> , nomad and founder of the web application for travelers. <a href="http://www.whatsitlikeapp.com/">What's It Like</a> .  I also volunteer with the <a href="http://nomadlist.com/">Nomadlist</a> team, present the <a href="https://nomadlist.com/stories/">best stories of successful nomads to the</a> world, and help with the shooting of the first <a href="http://digitalnomaddocumentary.com/">documentary film about nomads</a> .  I work traveling more than 5 years. <br><br><h2>  Most Popular Excuses </h2><br><h3>  Overwhelming level of uncertainty. </h3><br>  It's true.  But even with your current lifestyle, the level of uncertainty is no less.  If you do the same thing that others do - by social norms and ‚Äúnot showing off‚Äù - this often gives a false sense of certainty.  Nothing is certain.  It's a little scary to realize, but it's true.  So - look at things with a sober look.  Living in some uncertainty, traveling the world, is as likely as losing your best customer tomorrow while sitting in an office. <br><br><h3>  I'm not 20 years old </h3><br>  And what will you do about this?  Wait until you are younger?  I have nothing more to say on this subject, and how many years should you be to make such excuses? <br><br><h3>  I have no money to travel </h3><br>  It is perfectly!  After all, this means that from the very beginning you will have to use fantasy and a little brain.  During my travels, I met designers selling their posters and developers selling online books published on their own to extend their travels.  I met copywriters who shared their skills for the possibility of living, and entrepreneurs who worked 3 hours a day in the reserve to spend the rest of their time on a startup.  Travel without money was made, made and will be made - this is not an excuse. <br><br><h3>  I am not one of those Internet stars who launch three startups, raise capital and at the same time travel around Tibet or the jungles of Bolivia </h3><br>  Every time you start thinking that someone else deserves to travel more than you do - stop yourself, this is a silly comparison.  The one who succeeded and earned a reputation, worked on it and started where you are.  Comparing yourself with those successful guys about whom they write articles, corners you and kills all your resolve. <br><br><h3>  I don't know anything about how to work in other countries </h3><br>  It's easy - ask other nomads at <a href="http://nomadforum.io/">Nomadforum</a> .  <a href="http://nomadwiki.net/">The amount of knowledge gathered by the common forces of</a> successful nomads leaves no chance for this excuse. <br><br><h3>  And what do I get?  Just experience remotely? </h3><br>  In addition to all the practical advantages of distant work, except for creating start-ups in less expensive regions of the world with people who see further than ‚Äúwhat's on TV today?‚Äù, Apart from expanding to a nausea closed circle of connections, think about this.  A nomad's lifestyle gives you something that is almost impossible to achieve while working in your city, in your office or at home, namely, it allows you to go beyond your comfort zone and make sure your abilities are beyond the conventional system that has been created so as to stroke your head or slap your ass when you need it.  This is the simplest and most effective way, giving the opportunity to experience the very freedom to live according to its rules. <br><br><h2>  Future work </h2><br>  The nomadic lifestyle among Internet specialists is growing as a global phenomenon, as well as an active movement.  Advanced technology companies are beginning to realize that the ability to truly travel and explore the world, as well as autonomy, can make workers happier.  Happy workers = successful products = happy customers.  Working as a remote team, moving to less expensive regions of the world and gaining access to knowledge without georeferencing, startups increase their efficiency and reduce budget costs.  Entrepreneurs expand their circle of connections and take an active part in the global innovation hubs. <br><br>  All this tells me that we are moving towards a <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3043519/work-from-anywhere-startups-for-global-digital-nomads">new model of work</a> in the field of technology.  I see that the future of employment is closely related to <a href="http://workawaycamp.com/blog/digital-nomads-sign-of-post-materialism/">post-materialism</a> and the desire to add real value to the world, instead of sitting down in offices, which are, in essence, a relic of the past.  Agencies, studios and companies that will not be able to adapt to a new generation of nomadic specialists will miss out on bright talents, and at the same time the opportunity to bring innovations to their products and services.  We are now just in the time period when we have a real chance to take part in the future employment, while being in the present. <br><br>  <i>** The author of the article apologizes for possible errors in the publication, as it is not often necessary to practice with the Russian language.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289402/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289402/</a></p>
