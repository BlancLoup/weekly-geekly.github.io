  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The war in the cyber epoch: the concept of geocentric theater</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/1ad22a20/04d5c00a/71deef94/0e03a098.png"><br>  The development of cyberspace by the military has already led to a reassessment of many of the tenets of the military science of the past, and even ideas about the nature of global domination.  New military theorists and new theories have appeared. <br>  The most interesting current result of this process (it has obviously just begun, and still presents surprises) is probably the <a href="http://www.neogeography.ru/ru/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D141:2010-09-16-18-44-06%26catid%3D2:news%26Itemid%3D2">doctrine of ‚ÄúGeocentric TVD‚Äù</a> , advanced by the commander of the space forces of the US Air Force, General Robert Koehler.  It is based on the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe fundamental relationship between cybernetic and outer space.  It is worth discussing the short but eventful history of the recognition of the geocentric theater doctrine, at least to outline its main postulates here, and try to understand its meaning. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Events developed as follows. <br>  On March 31, 2009, at the 25th Space Symposium, General K√∂hler unexpectedly used the new term - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DBT_rPz9x5og">‚ÄúGeocentric theater of military operations‚Äù</a> (Spherical Battlespace) and described it in several phrases.  The new theater of war extends from top to bottom from the level of the geostationary orbit (36 thousand km above the Earth) to its surface, gradually absorbing all the previous arenas (domains in American terminology) of military confrontation - space, atmosphere, land, sea, and also new domain is cyberspace. <br>  Immediately after this, in April 2009, General K√∂hler insisted on a seemingly completely senseless and illogical decision - submission to the cyber arm of the command of the space forces (AFSPC).  It would seem that sheer nonsense - the cyber war and the space forces are operating in completely different environments, using different methods and solving various tasks.  It is the same as subjugating sailors to infantry, or aviation infantry. <br>  However, in May of the same year, the United States Senate heard and approved the proposals of the general.  Cyber ‚Äã‚Äãtroops were decided to subjugate the space. <br>  A year later, on May 21, 2010, the cybernetic command of USCYBERCOM reached the status of Initial Operational Capability (IOC).  At the same time, it was not subordinated to the command of the space forces, as Koehler insisted, but directly to the strategic command of USSTRATCOM.  It would seem a contradiction - the scheme Koehler rejected?  Not.  Even at the end of the summer, it became known that President Obama nominated him <a href="http://www.neogeography.ru/ru/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D109:sao%26catid%3D2:news%26Itemid%3D2">for the post of commander of the strategic command</a> .  Such a personnel decision looks quite logical - in the new post it will be easier for the general to implement the new doctrine.  Koehr's hearings in the Senate preceding the appointment to the post of commander of the USSTRATCOM took place less than a week ago, on November 18, the outcome of which is still unknown to us. <br>  On October 14, 2010, the <a href="http://www.neogeography.ru/ru/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D199:2010-10-15-12-37-00%26catid%3D1:articles%26Itemid%3D3">AFDD3-12 Cyberspace Operations</a> guideline approved for July 15 was first published.  It was noted that cyberspace is the first in the history of an artificial arena of hostilities.  Before its appearance, wars were fought only in natural domains, that is, on land, at sea, in the air and in space. <br>  On November 3, cyber command reached full combat status (FOC, Full Operational Capability).  US Deputy Secretary of Defense William Lynn described cyberspace as <a href="http://www.neogeography.ru/ru/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D241:-usstratcom-space-symposium%26catid%3D2:news%26Itemid%3D2">the newest and most current (latest) domain in general</a> .  Regardless of his right or wrong, it is clear that the official point of view was expressed.  And if so, then the battle for him will be very decisive when all means are good. <br>  What is the meaning of geocentric TVD concept?  Fully in one topic can not be stated, besides its systematic and holistic presentation, we have not yet come across.  Yes, and military thought does not stand still, the concept is being developed and transformed.  However, its presence and its consistent implementation is a fact obvious. <br>  Let us designate for the beginning the main provisions of the Kohler doctrine, as well as conclusions and implications of them, in the form of theses. <br>  1. The whole geocentric space is a single arena of military confrontation.  By the way, the geocentric TVD space is very well described by the term ‚Äúnoosphere‚Äù. <br>  2. Space and cybernetic troops dominate the geocentric theater, which are actually a single whole and operating under a single command. <br>  3. This unity of space and cyber war is due to two factors.  First, the transience of operations.  Secondly, the actual absence from now on of the differences between the strategic and tactical levels of control. <br>  4. The latter means that in the new reality the information necessary to control the fighting can no longer be divided into tactical (detailed and local) and strategic (global, but not as detailed) as it was before.  At all levels of the troop command and control system, the informational image of the situation must be the same - in fact, it must become ‚Äúrubber‚Äù, deification (generalization) is impossible and unacceptable.  This provision is known as the <a href="http://www.neogeography.ru/ru/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D11%26Itemid%3D9">principle of Situational Awareness</a> . <br>  5. Naturally, the information in this case should be both three-dimensional and dynamic.  Any event, object, process <a href="http://www.neogeography.ru/ru/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D251:nga-%26catid%3D2:news%26Itemid%3D2">must be localized</a> both in space and in time. <br>  6. In this situation, cyberspace becomes not just an environment in which opponents destroy each other‚Äôs networks, but also a carrier of an information image of a geocentric space - the most important condition for victory in a war, a special ‚Äúgeo-information system‚Äù.  Without an information image of the current situation, victory in the war is impossible, and with it, it becomes predetermined.  Because victory is achieved through the early identification of threats and neutralizing them with the help of the concentration of resources ‚Äî where and when and where it is necessary.  To dominate everywhere and always will not work - this is explicitly stated in Cyberspace Operations. <br>  7. Victory is no longer achieved through the depletion of the enemy, but through ‚Äúdiscouraging‚Äù him through actions that change the situation so quickly that he can no longer not only do something, but also perceive it - the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maneuver_warfare">concept of Maneuver Warfare</a> brought to its logical conclusion. <br><br>  The concept of geocentric TVD is a development of the ideas of other leading US military theorists ‚Äî Admiral Mahan, and especially Col. Boyd (OODA-Loop), who did much to ensure US domination in the modern world.  It's time to study the ideas of the colonel in more detail.  If the topic touched on here seems interesting, the following material will be about Colonel Boyd. </div>
