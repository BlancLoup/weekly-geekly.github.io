      <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/android-ndk-game-development-cookbook/book">www.packtpub.com/android-ndk-game-development-cookbook/book</a> <br><br>  The book is devoted to how to develop portable C ++ code for mobile applications on the example of games for Android.  Those.  when the game is developed most of the time on a PC, and then it is simply assembled and tested on a mobile device.  No ready-made engines are used - only C ++ and open-source libraries.  Android-specific things are also not used: .apk unpack through libcompress, output sound through OpenAL, go to the network via libcurl, use JNI services to the minimum. <br><br>  While writing the book, the target audience was not entirely clear.  Many things can be incomprehensible to Beginner, and advanced developers themselves can easily write such a mini-framework.  I think that the book is focused on the intermediate developers who already know how to write simple C ++ applications for Android.  In general, this book should not be the very first book on the Android NDK, with which you need to begin acquaintance with him :) <br><br>  The source code of all projects is attached to the book.  The latest version is available on GitHub: <a href="http://github.com/corporateshark/Android-NDK-Game-Development-Cookbook">github.com/corporateshark/Android-NDK-Game-Development-Cookbook</a> <br><br><h5>  Now a little about the process itself </h5><br><br>  It all started with the fact that the acquisition manager of the publisher Packt Publishing came to us and offered to write a book under the already prepared title.  The content of the book, we could determine completely independently.  After several iterations of the discussion of options, a draft outline of the book appeared, with the title of all chapters and a description of their contents.  After that, we were sent a standard contract from which we were able to remove some of the points that we didn‚Äôt like (the first priority of the publisher was to get acquainted with the future books of the authors for N years) and to extend the terms of writing chapters (3 weeks against 2 weeks per chapter).  The contract was signed and work began on a draft of the book. <br><br>  When you start writing a chapter, in the beginning it is not clear what to write about.  But it turned out that it is enough to write the code for the chapter and after that the text itself flows like water in 2-3 days (about 30 pages for each chapter) and in the stipulated 3 weeks we fit in with a margin. <br><br>  The Milestones were identified, as they were completed, the publishing house paid part of the advance payment: submission of draft copies of chapters 1‚Äì5, delivery of draft copies of 6‚Äì10 chapters, delivery of all reviewed chapters, release of a book.  In addition, a bonus was provided for the delivery of all drafts in the period specified in the contract (and we received this bonus). <br><br>  After the draft chapter is ready, it is viewed by the editor, who makes corrections and suggestions.  As a result of several such iterations a final draft of the chapter is obtained.  It is transmitted to reviewers who thoughtfully read the text and write even more comments.  We started to correct them only after the drafts of all chapters were written. <br><br>  Then the <b>pre-production</b> stage begins.  The publishing house receives the corrected chapters and makes a decision: ‚ÄúYes, we will publish this book!‚Äù And opens the pre-order page of the book on its website.  By this time (and 6 months have passed since the very first draft of the first chapter was written), the authors accumulate a list of <s>bug</s> fixes and additions that they would like to include in the book (for example, the technology went ahead and a new version of Android and NDK came out).  It takes a couple of weeks to rewrite the entire text of the book.  You can add / remove any text, change the formatting, etc.  At this stage, the book does not yet have the visual structure that readers will see.  All work is still going on in Word. <br><br>  After the rewritten text is submitted, the <b>production</b> phase begins.  Word files are rendered into a set and the result is a beautiful .pdf, which is already very similar to the final version of the book.  At this stage, you can make minor additions and corrections to the book.  Also included in the work corrector, which helps to correct the language style and grammatical errors.  After another two weeks, when all changes are made, the authors are sent the <b>pre-final</b> versions in .pdf.  The book is almost finished.  In pre-finals, you can fix only typos and serious ‚Äúbloopers‚Äù.  It‚Äôs just impossible to finish the text in this way. <br><br>  A few days after the author confirms the quality of the pre-final version, the publisher puts the electronic version of the book on the site.  On the same day, shipping of printed copies begins. <br><br>  Immediately I answer some supposed questions: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>How is the process of paying authors?</b>  Wire transfers as Milestown delivery, directly to the account in the Russian Bank. </li><li>  <b>Whether the Russian version of the book is not expected</b> .  In order for a Russian-language version to appear, there should be a publisher that publishes books in Russian and will be interested in this book. </li></ul><br><br>  PS Many thanks to Alexander Pavlov (Google, St. Petersburg) for additional review of our book.  Sasha, you have no idea how much she has become better! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203752/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203752/</a></p>
