  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Successful Twitter Recipe</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <strong>The perfect twitterer</strong> is a person who is able to generate ‚Äú <em>short entertainments,</em> ‚Äù with a frequency of two per hour.  At the same time, he is <em>not an idle</em> person (and this is not a paradox; Twitter is not confined to being the main occupation, he is rather a tree on which a hard worker puts notches about what he has done (seen and heard) in the ‚Äúbig life‚Äù)  The ideal twitterer is positive, does not allow grammatical errors, does not curse without motive and does not verbally.  The perfect twitterer can be born.  And you can become one.  At least you can <i>try</i> . <br><br>  There is an opinion that ‚Äúyou can write to Twitter the same as in a regular blog, only briefly‚Äù.  This is not true.  Posts on Twitter can be divided into ten types: <br><br>  1. <strong>Lytdybry</strong> .  With such posts, it is just the right time for people who tweet (or in life outside of it) to commit a certain ‚Äúweight‚Äù to sin.  Nobody cares that you, Vasya, ate soup.  Unless, of course, you are not Vasya Strelnikov (feel the difference).  Although, if it was ‚Äúa <em>soup from the appendages of a dwarf white elephant</em> ‚Äù, which you personally and uhohil, the chances of success can significantly increase.

      2. <strong>Quotes</strong> .  Some (I am writing with comic pride) have quotes " <em>from myself</em> ."  But in general - any short sayings.  On the topic of the day, or "timeless philosophical significance."  (The erased quotation from the ‚ÄúGolden Placers‚Äù - for a nick of an old woman on a book collapse - and that's the hat. A joke.) <br><br>  3. <strong>Jokes</strong> .  It is important to note - not jokes, namely <em>jokes</em> .  And best of all: a) your own;  b) fresh-born.  (Yes, precisely because the beard doesn't fit in a tweet.) <br><br>  4. <strong>Paradoxes</strong> .  Brilliant typos, illogical statements to tears, or complete nonsense like a " <em>passive necrophile</em> ."  There are real masters of the genre, who with the next "push" can dispel any depression. <br><br>  5. <strong>Links</strong> .  (For the sake of which, as it seems to many, Twitter and start up.) We will <em>fight</em> about ‚Äú <em>Twitter siiar</em> ‚Äù later, but for now I will say this: more than three links in a row - and you look, sound and smell like ‚Äú <em>bot</em> ‚Äù.  Draw conclusions. <br><br>  6. <strong>Pictures</strong> .  Of course - links to pictures.  Good camouflage for " <em>lytdybrov</em> ."  Important!  If the pictures are made by iphone and posted on Twitter, then success is almost guaranteed. <br><br>  7. <strong>News</strong> .  " <em>Latest news</em> " - a thing, of course, fantastic.  But suddenly you were lucky, and it was you who held Michael Jackson's hand, escorting him to his last journey?  Then feel free to write about it.  But remember!  <em>If there is where to give a link, most likely this is no longer news</em> .  (That's tweet, by the way; guess the category?) <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  8. <strong>Questions</strong> .  If you came to Twitter <em>not only for the answers</em> , feel free to ask questions.  It is not true that this is entertainment that is available only to despicable mass followers.  Even among your 500 followers, there will easily be someone who knows the answer, or is ready to share the information you need (and in a good case, not only information). <br><br>  9. <strong>Answers</strong> .  In order to tweet the answers do not have to wait for questions.  There are so many chances that you have some useful knowledge that can be pushed into 140 characters.  Say, "the <em>mouse wheel closes the browser tabs</em> ."  You will be surprised, but not everyone knows about it. <br><br>  10. <strong>Slogans</strong> .  Twitter is a great place to publicly express your attitude towards Microsoft, Bill Gates personally, as well as his family members, or ... members of the Polish Sejm (just members, by the way, are also possible; for this, #sexymonday exists) .  Start a holivar, speak out about the unfortunate pandas, Palestinians, system administrators ... <br><br>  As a bonus, I will add two more Twitter system capabilities that have become a genre.  These are ‚Äúreplays‚Äù and ‚Äúretweets‚Äù. <br><br>  11. <strong>Replay</strong> can write to anyone Twittering, whether he is the heir to the Swedish throne, or your classmate.  Both, however, can ignore you.  The main thing is for the joy that they nevertheless responded, not to succumb to the temptation and not to dissolve the multi-replay discussion, which is not clear for everyone except your most faithful followers (and even annoying them). <br><br>  12. <strong>Retweet</strong> is a great opportunity to replicate someone else's wit, awareness or civic position, earning the glory of a tenacious and big-eyed digester.  In addition, depending on the character, the egoist will ‚Äúpick up‚Äù the ‚Äúdelicacy‚Äù noticed for himself, and the altruist will share it with others. <br><br>  The categories described above are the ingredients of proper Twitter posting.  I would compare most of them with spices.  The recipe for success is in what proportions you choose.  Spices are necessary, but a dish consisting solely of them (for a long time) is impossible.  However, it is possible to gain the success of a genre Twitterman in colorful, multi-drop tapes, where your paradoxes (lytdybry, slogans) do not seem intrusive and inappropriate. <br><br>  Successful to you tweets!  <a href="http://twitter.com/misha_kvakin">@misha_kvakin</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64220/</a></p>
