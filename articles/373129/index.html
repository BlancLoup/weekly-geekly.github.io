  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Impact Russian overclocking - how enthusiasts won eight awards overnight for overclocking the latest Intel processors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Russian overclockers are the most brutal overclockers in the world!  In the ability to squeeze the maximum out of iron, they often turn out to be more agile than Taiwanese grown up in the edge of semiconductor production, and talents from the United States, to whom the processor developers are "domestic producers."  This time, the guys from Russia took 8 podiums immediately after they coped with just released Intel Kaby Lake processors.  We tell in details about the most powerful gland in the world and its tamers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9d7/3a0/dea/9d73a0dea72e412c8d3197b120fbffdd.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Overclocking is beautiful and dramatic because there are no ‚Äúlifelong kings‚Äù in it.  With the debut of each new micro-architecture of processors or video cards, the performance tables change the ‚Äúscenery‚Äù and indices of record-breaking equipment.  But the pros do not disappear anywhere - overclocking rests on "maniacs", who are not interested in the new hardware, whether the next Call of Duty goes on it, but efficiency in extreme, extreme modes of operation. <br><br>  The release of a new generation of processors or video cards is an exciting event for overclockers, because the newest, balanced, energy-efficient and inexpensive CPU can be the most natural piece ... of a chip without any performance margin (there is no reason not to save on customers if they don‚Äôt see the difference) or reliability for work in the "sports" pace.  And even more so no one expects to set records on the platform that has just been released - there is always the risk of running into a firm branded constructive dirty trick, as was the case, for example, with a thermal interface under the Ivy Bridge / Haswell chip cover, or ‚Äúglitches‚Äù of the PCI-Express bus controller after his move from the north bridge under the cover of modern processors.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/004/b14/cb5/004b14cb5edf47529594ecf21152bf87.jpg"><br>  <i>Russian overclockers set eight records almost immediately after meeting the new Intel processors</i> <br><br>  In general, after the debut of new chips, everyone is waiting for their ‚Äúrunning in‚Äù and do not hope for world performance records before gaining experience in working with a fresh hardware platform.  But the guys from Team Russia proved that the Russians are not necessarily long-timed - in the very first bench session using Intel Kaby Lake processors, overclocking <b>Smoke</b> , <b>slamms</b> , <b>_12_</b> , <b>Atheros</b> and <b>IceAlex</b> secured eight world performance records for Russia.  Here is how it was: <br><br><h2>  He called himself a new processor - get into the benchmarks! </h2><br>  Unpleasant surprises with the announcement of new generations of processors happened regularly, but in the case of Kaby Lake there was nothing to be afraid of - because of the expensive and painful introduction of chips based on new Intel process technology, the cycle of a radical update of their CPUs was <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/273180/">extended</a> from two to three stages.  Therefore, representatives of Skylake (2015) carried the micro-architecture in themselves, but Kaby Lake is a <s>file</s> modified with a new <s>file</s> taking into account new production standards and more promising from the point of view of overclocking skylake. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a6/534/502/1a65345023a24d508ca25f7606745531.jpg"><br>  <i>Intel Kaby Lake - a new old generation of processors</i> <br><br>  But this is in theory and in the beautiful slides of the manufacturer, but what is (and is it at all) the difference between new and old Intel chips in extreme overclocking with nitrogen?  To test the overclocking qualities of the new processors, ASUS and HyperX organized a joint event of the OC Summit in Moscow - a kind benefit of Kaby Lake and a reason to torture new chips at the limit of their potential in the variegated tests.  And the first "combat" tests showed that even "cosmetic", minor at first glance, refinements come in handy when the processor plays the role of a sports projectile.  The newly formed Intel Core i7-7700K by the efforts of the pros from Team Russia erected a monument to man-made from records in three processor disciplines and five gaming benchmarks. <br><br><h2>  Champion PC Configuration Secrets </h2><br>  Even in a home gaming PC, the components must work smoothly.  It is necessary that the potential of each of the subsystems be revealed, as in American sports dramas with ‚Äúovercoming‚Äù difficulties by teams of sportsmen.  The computers of overclocking stars, of course, also do not depend only on a certain miraculous processor.  Each component of the configuration is sharpened by efficiency, and not on okaymeyrsky pathos.  No GeForce Titan in SLI or tons of RAM, if such a mixture does not affect the result.  So, by name: <br><br>  <b>Processor: Intel Core i7-7700K overclocked to 6783-6828 MHz</b> (depending on the test).  The most modern and efficient Intel processor.  "Just" quad-core, but this is enough to surpass in the main overclocking disciplines of the eight-core "slug". <br>  How does the flagship of the Kaby Lake family differ from its predecessor with the 6700K index?  Limit possibilities!  For example, in the case of Skylake, it was necessary to work hard to find a processor capable of running on a ‚Äúfull glass‚Äù (-196 degrees Celsius, maximum cooling when using liquid nitrogen), because processors often caught coolbag and were not ready for extreme cooling.  Among Kaby Lake, "stunted" processors are not found at all - the guys from Team Russia are pleased to note that the new Intel chips are working without problems "on a full glass." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aac/f41/79e/aacf4179ee614eda9269a57c47cbea98.jpg"><br>  <i>Intel Kaby Lake processors are much more stable under nitrogen than Skylake</i> <br><br>  Is there any benefit from process optimization for non-overclockers?  There is!  In opposition to the same hierarchy of processors Intel Skylake and Kaby Lake, the latter will always have a higher frequency, and hence a higher performance.  When overclocked using air or water cooling, the 6700K can produce 4.7‚Äì4.7 GHz in Turbo Boost mode, while the 7700K always hits the 5 GHz bar and can even work at 5.1‚Äì5.2 GHz. <br><br>  <b>Thermal interface under the processor cover: Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut</b> .  Extreme overclocking today is always associated with processor scalping.  You will laugh, but with the suggestion of Intel, such fun has ceased to be exotic even in the "home" overclocking <a href="http://www.overclockers.com/ivy-bridge-temperatures/">for five years</a> . <br><br>  Popular recipes, however, recommend replacing the standard thermal compound under the lid with liquid metal, but overclocking at a negative temperature with such a thermal interface is impossible - the metal simply rolls up and rolls into a ball instead of exercising its official powers. <br><br>  <b>Motherboard: ASUS ROG Maximus IX Apex</b> .  Not a luxury, but a model resistant to extreme temperatures based on the Intel Z270 chipset. <br><br>  Kaby Lake processors can be overclocked on older motherboards based on the Z170 chipset (developed for Skylake), but no one has canceled the BIOS optimization, so in the everyday plan, the motherboard of the ‚Äútwo-cell‚Äù family is more convenient for overclocking new Intel Core, because in order to achieve one the same frequency needs to be changed much less parameters.  For example, stable 5 GHz on Kaby Lake in the Z270 chipset can be achieved immediately after adjusting the voltage on the core - all other parameters will be correctly selected by the automation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2f1/e19/86c/2f1e1986c6934b0fa86e255b1cde6d5f.jpeg"><br>  <i>Kaby Lake can be overclocked on the Z170 chipset, but with the Z270 it is easier and faster to do this</i> <br><br>  The motherboards on the basis of the Z170 chipset will need at least ‚Äúpicking‚Äù VCCIO (voltage to the integrated memory controller) and VCCSA (controlling the voltage of the components, including the power management module, the same memory controller, DMI bus, PCI-Express controllers ...).  In general, the new chipset makes life a little easier and saves time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/854/fab/43f/854fab43f6b64111a9124d2cdaf6de0f.JPG"><br>  <i>ASUS ROG Maximus IX Apex</i> <br><br>  <b>Memory: HyperX Predator (HX432C16PB3K2 and HX432C16PB3K4)</b> .  DDR4 modules of 4 and 8 GB with a frequency of 3200 MHz with CL16 in "stock".  Pleasure is not cheap, but who is easy now?  Frequency requirements and delay levels leave no other choice. <br><br>  But the top Predator modules are fast and efficient, and this is important when it comes to fighting for a world record.  You can save on other components ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/853/bcf/1e8/853bcf1e8a1a4470bb032c21ee1c66d5.jpg"><br>  <i>Record performance computer - the fastest memory HyperX!</i> <br><br>  <b>Drives</b> : ... for example, on SSD.  Unexpectedly, but a fact - for eight different benchmarks (calm, we saved their list for ‚Äúdessert), the performance of available <b>HyperX Fury and Savage</b> SATA drives with a capacity of only 120 and 240 GB was enough. <br><br>  The bottom line is that the speed of access to information in the tests was enough, and the main requirement for drives, according to overclockers, was reliability - enthusiasts are constantly looking for ways to ‚Äútweak‚Äù the operating system (as part of what is permitted, of course).  For example, the first thing an overclocker does with Windows 7 before launching benchmarks is turning off the Aero interface.  For the average user, such a measure is ‚Äúcatching fleas,‚Äù but if it helps to improve the result, it is not neglected. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/918/a0e/1dc/918a0e1dc0d243d3b315f194ebc8c894.jpg"><br>  <i>For multiple world records, there was enough performance for inexpensive SSD HyperX Fury and HyperX Savage</i> <br><br>  Further - more, and because of the many experimental settings, overclockers ‚Äúdrop‚Äù the system on the drive several times a day, and then restore it from the backup.  In such conditions, it is important that the drive not only does not die, but also does not degrade from such rates of cell rewriting.  HyperX is doing well. <br><br>  By the way, in the "combat" configuration for more intensive tests based on Intel Kaby Lake there is a place for high-performance SSDs - the Maximus IX Apex mentioned above was equipped with only two RAM slots, and at least the slots are soldered on it, because without a bulky "home kit" overclocking motherboard is faster. <br><br>  So: in place of the third RAM slot, there is a DIMM.2 module into which, via a special adapter, you can connect a pair of drives with the M.2 interface - HyperX Predator, for example.  In this embodiment, the configuration can be used for the most modern and responsive SSD tests. <br><br>  <b>Video card: ASUS ROG STRIX GeForce GTX 1080 OC Edition</b> .  "Pretop", but fast enough and stable card in order to "shake" the latest Intel Core i7.  Almost in serial condition, air-cooled, overclocked to 2088 MHz in the core and 1800 MHz in memory.  For home PCs it looks menacing, but in the world of overclocking it is a ‚Äúworkhorse‚Äù, sorry for the clich√©.  Unpretentious proven model, which is enough for many (but not all) benchmarks, not counting the latest graphics tests, like 3DMark Time Spy and Unigine Heaven.  Part of the records in the OC Summit, this video card was extracted in the composition of the SLI.  And the power supply provided block Corsair 1200 watts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e30/4d4/563/e304d456374f4e928c21dbb9576d49e7.jpg"><br>  <i>ASUS ROG STRIX GeForce GTX 1080 is not super-cool by overclocking standards, but in many benchmarks it reveals the potential of Kaby Lake Core i7</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b89/728/677/b89728677ece4b2ea6740d11843e82b4.jpeg"><br>  <i>The video card did without major improvements in comparison with serial condition</i> <br><br><h2>  Thanks to them, Russian overclocking is cool in 2017 </h2><br>  Processors come and go, but the characters remain - because it is always important <a href="http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/1741896/">to make overclocking great again</a> , isn't it?  Therefore - briefly about the talented guys from <b>Team Russia</b> : <br><br>  <b>Smoke</b> is a famous overclocker, one of the few who retained the HWBot champion title for a year.  He manages to be skeptical of the modern gland and at the same time squeeze the maximum out of it, and also turn the ‚Äúnon-perverse‚Äù into ‚Äúperverse‚Äù modifications.  He told us about all the joys and tribulations in the life of an overclocker in a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/280998/">detailed interview</a> . <br><br>  <b>slamms</b> - the <b>old school</b> hero, the legend of Russian overclocking, one of the most experienced overs in Team Russia.  The ASUS ROG virtuoso in iron handling competes equally well with the best overseas overseas, the ‚Äúmulti-channel‚Äù is equally steep in handling Intel and AMD hardware.  Supervised <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DErP1ABz1ENs">overclocking World of Tanks</a> on overclocking components right up to 500 fps. <br><br>  <b>_12_</b> is a famous independent overclocker.  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/kingston_technology/blog/283038/">He sets records in packs</a> , loves and knows how to disperse old iron "above the roof" and extract astronomical frequencies from AMD FX stoves.  Effective, experienced and dangerous for competitors rival in the overclocking arena. <br><br>  <b>Atheros</b> - makes the "go fast" even non-pathetic processors, like the Intel Core i3.  Able to "tune up" dreary at overclocking a video card like Titan X to a serious overclocking condition. <br><br>  <b>IceAlex</b> - best of all able to benefit from the powder in the flasks.  He is always experimenting - he switched from ‚Äúcruel‚Äù overclocking of Pentium 4 and Celeron on air cooling to modern Intel Core, but is still the coolest in the ability to ‚Äúshake up‚Äù hot Cedar Mill and modern AMD chips. <br><br><h2>  How many weighed in parrots? </h2><br>  And here are the performance results - all eight records from the ASUS OC Summit event.  For a start, multi-thread computing: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>benchmark</b> </td><td>  <b>result</b> </td><td>  <b>processor and its clock frequency in the test</b> </td><td>  <b>global place in the world</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  cinebench r15 </td><td>  1515 cb </td><td>  (intel core i7-7700k, <br>  6783 MHz) </td><td>  1 (gold) </td></tr><tr><td>  hwbot prime </td><td>  8471.65 pps </td><td>  (intel core i7-7700k, <br>  6695 MHz) </td><td>  1 (gold) </td></tr><tr><td>  wprime 1024m </td><td>  1min 31sec 516ms </td><td>  (intel core i7-7700k, <br>  6828 MHz) </td><td>  1 (gold) </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  And graphic benchmarks: <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <b>benchmark</b> </td><td>  <b>result</b> </td><td>  <b>graphics processor</b> </td><td>  <b>global place in the world</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  3dmark05 </td><td>  88398 marks </td><td>  geforce gtx 1080 <br>  2088 / 1450mhz </td><td>  1 (gold) </td></tr><tr><td>  3dmark05 </td><td>  87604 marks </td><td>  2x geforce gtx 1080 <br>  2088 / 1450mhz </td><td>  1 (gold) </td></tr><tr><td>  3dmark06 </td><td>  68888 marks </td><td>  geforce gtx 1080 <br>  2088 / 1450mhz </td><td>  1 (gold) </td></tr><tr><td>  3dmark06 </td><td>  68766 marks </td><td>  2x geforce gtx 1080 <br>  2088 / 1450mhz </td><td>  1 (gold) </td></tr><tr><td>  aquamark </td><td>  652098 marks </td><td>  geforce gtx 1080 <br>  2088 / 1450mhz </td><td>  1 (gold) </td></tr></tbody></table><br>  A completely universal "stone" turned out, as you see, and Kaby Lake can be called one of the most intelligent CPU families for enthusiasts in the past few years. <br><br><h2>  Overclocking lived, alive and will live! </h2><br>  As you can see, even in a crisis, the Russian land certainly will not become scanty talented enthusiasts!  And super-fast computers continue to become cooler from year to year, even at the expense of minor improvements.
