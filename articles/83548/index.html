Feelings are twofold.  On the one hand, it works, but at what price, gentlemen.  It seems I can now go adminin Linux server. <br><br>  * NAS, or Network Attached Storage, is such a box with a screw that connects to the network and quietly performs the functions of a file server and torrent rockers standing in the corner.  Better than special servers in the following parameters: of course, price, size, power consumption. <br><br><h4>  Short. </h4><br>  <b>Should I buy?</b> <br>  No, if you are not a Linux guru and / or do not like to bang your head on a wall.

Because there is very little information on the Internet and I had to re-read everything in general in order to achieve at least something.  To make it easier for the Habravchan brothers (although I have no doubt that most of you would successfully complete this quest on your own and probably faster than me), I publish the instructions in one place. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Long </h4><br>  I have a weak MacBookPro, which I constantly carry with me, and I have a screw on it 200 (not real) gigabytes.  Therefore, I wanted to myself a file storage / torentokachalku.  To stand in the corner and file the torrent and torrent.  Moreover, there is a screw on a terabyte. <br><br>  Being an ardent Apple fan, I went and bought a <s>Time Capsule</s> <a href="http://www.istor.ru/">i-Stor iS607</a> , because it looks like a Mac Pro.  A sort of Mac Pro Mini.  By the way, a great idea, the existing Mac Mini doesn't impress me at all.  I really hoped that I would turn it on to the network and everything at once would magically be good, logical, and most importantly work. <br><br>  Well, I do not. <br><br>  I was lucky 3 times.  The first time I slipped at the door and almost nafig broke the 607th and lying next to the screw.  The second time - my screw (hurray!) Was supported by it, and as I found out from the huge 39-page <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D11:38321">branch of the forum</a> , this happens only 3 times during the winter solstice on even years.  37 pages out of 39 cry about this.  And finally, I was lucky with the old Dlink DIR-300 WiFi point, even though someone said that the device does not hold it.  In the same forum, a couple of pages crying about expensive routers to which the iS607 is squeamish about connecting at all or running at 3600 Bod. <br><br>  <b>So setting.</b> <br><br>  From the very beginning, I was greeted by a stupid braked Web snout, in which the default language is Chinese in the options, even though the interface is in (Chinese) English.  On the Internet, they <a href="http://forum.istor.ru/viewtopic.php%3Ff%3D6%26t%3D173">write</a> that telnet is available there.  I probably got a special new version in which they decided to remove it.  NO TAM TELNET.  And it does not react to any magic files in the / applications / new_software folders in different variations of the register and the position of the words. <br><br>  The iS607's built-in torrent is also a bit more than full.  Download them completely impossible nothing and nothing. <br><br>  <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D11:39745">Here is a</a> good man gathered instructions for setting up.  <b>DO NOT DOWN THE FIRMWARE FROM THERE</b> .  At me it stupidly did not react at all to anything except the web of the muzzle, which did not load the menu.  Neither telnet nor ftp nor samba.  And in the same 39-page topic, 15 people discuss how to kill a dead device by flashing it back to life with the help of an old wire from a Siemens phone.  Raise your hand, who has at hand a wire from a Siemens phone and a soldering iron. <br><br>  And the topic starts so well from the first post: <br>  <i>RS232 pinout on i-Stor iS607 board</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Connector j2 (10-pin) - under the transparent label on the left above the disk.</i> <br><br>  I already began to think about looking for a hammer and trying to fix this thing in the old Russian way, but in the depths of the same epic topic on the forum I found a person who had the same problem.  He, therefore, wrote a plea for help about this, and three days later he came and shared his decision. <br><br>  Gentlemen, it was NECESSARY TO CLEAN COOKIES!  That is, the person did not sleep for 3 days, did not eat, but tried all possible and impossible techniques to do something about it.  I would not be surprised if he splashed around him with a tambourine and read him bedtime stories.  Then his 13-year-old brother came, climbed the 18+ sites, cleared the cookies for him and EVERYONE HAVE EARNED! <br><br>  I don't have a 13 year old brother.  What would I do, I do not know. <br><br>  In general, earned a muzzle.  And nothing more.  Thank Bosch, I found <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D11:38321:903">this firmware</a> . <br><br>  <b>(1) BECOMING A <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D11:38321:903">FIRMWARE</a> FROM <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D11:38321:903">HERE</a></b> <br><br>  We download the file and make an update through the iS607 web-muzzle.  It has ssh.  Login: root, password: *********** (that is, what you installed in the webmord user admin).  NFS does not work for me with a poppy on any firmware no matter what I do.  I do not know whose jamb. <br><br>  <b>(2) PUT OPTWARE</b> <br><br>  From the same <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D11:39745">FAQ,</a> download the file with optware.  With this firmware, no / Public / Software / New_Software work and telnet is not there.  Copy the contents of the archive (another archive and init script) into the folder public / applications / optware and run the script.  It will copy optware to the public folder below. <br><br>  <b>(3) OPTWARE APPALITY</b> <br><br>  ipkg update <br>  ipkg upgrade <br><br>  The script was supposed to register a link to the optware folder and add a junk slip to the PATH.  <b>IN NO EVENT, DO NOT RESTART</b> .  Dull garbage resets all settings, if you happen to have it, scroll down. <br><br>  What I did not understand, it looks like the system is holding onto some kind of flash drive with a size of 16 megabytes.  So you will not be able to disperse especially in the software.  A friend advised me to install nano, but it was bent already at the stage of downloading the distribution. <br><br>  <b>(4) BEGIN TRANSMISSION</b> <br><br>  ipkg install transmission <br><br>  I did this.  Transmishn last I really liked.  He has a super web muzzle at http: // ***: 9091 / transmission / web /.  He needs to register a config.  In the public folder, I made the config folder and shoved settings.json with that content there. <br><br>  { <br>  "Alt-speed-down": 50, <br>  "Alt-speed-enabled": false, <br>  Alt-speed-time-begin: 540, <br>  Alt-speed-time-day: 127, <br>  "Alt-speed-time-enabled": false, <br>  Alt-speed-time-end: 1020, <br>  Alt-speed-up: 50, <br>  "Bind-address-ipv4": "0.0.0.0", <br>  "Bind-address-ipv6": "::", <br>  "Blocklist-enabled": false, <br>  "Dht-enabled": true <br>  "Download-dir": "\ / mnt \ / ide2 \ / public \ / bt_download", <br>  "Encryption": 0, <br>  "Incomplete-dir": "\ / mnt \ / ide2 \ / public \ / bt_incomplete", <br>  "Incomplete-dir-enabled": true, <br>  "Lazy-bitfield-enabled": true <br>  "Message-level": 2, <br>  "Open-file-limit": 32, <br>  Peer-limit-global: 240, <br>  Peer-limit-per-torrent: 60, <br>  ‚ÄúPeer-port‚Äù: 51413, <br>  Peer-port-random-high: 65535, <br>  "Peer-port-random-low": 49152, <br>  "Peer-port-random-on-start": false, <br>  "Peer-socket-tos": 0, <br>  "Pex-enabled": true <br>  "Port-forwarding-enabled": true <br>  "Preallocation": 2, <br>  "Proxy": "", <br>  "Proxy-auth-enabled": false, <br>  "Proxy-auth-password": "", <br>  "Proxy-auth-username": "", <br>  "Proxy-enabled": false, <br>  "Proxy-port": 80, <br>  "Proxy-type": 0, <br>  "Ratio-limit": 0, <br>  "Ratio-limit-enabled": false, <br>  "Rename-partial-files": true <br>  "Rpc-authentication-required": false, <br>  "Rpc-bind-address": "0.0.0.0", <br>  "Rpc-enabled": true <br>  "Rpc-password": "{b1ed3f8df078500240e5bafe5e8b1c10cf1b3b8fVE3nfcdL", <br>  "Rpc-port": 9091, <br>  "Rpc-username": "", <br>  "Rpc-whitelist": "127.0.0.1,192.168.0. *", <br>  "Rpc-whitelist-enabled": true, <br>  "Speed-limit-down": 100, <br>  "Speed-limit-down-enabled": false, <br>  "Speed-limit-up": 100, <br>  "Speed-limit-up-enabled": false, <br>  "Umask": 18, <br>  Upload-slots-per-torrent: 20 <br>  } <br><br>  I tried to make an authorization, but in any configuration he didn‚Äôt care and I scored. <br><br>  <b>(5) PUT ANY JUNTER FOR TIME MACHINE</b> <br><br>  Since Time Machine stubbornly refused to back up to the iS607 samba disk, I had to install AFP support.  With him, by the way, the external stack does not fall off or falls off very rarely.  Samba I have to periodically reconnect.  And judging by the forum, not just me. <br><br>  So again we are looking at <a href="http://forum.ixbt.com/topic.cgi%3Fid%3D11:39745">this topic</a> .  I quote removing the excess.  <b>DO NOT REBOOT !!!</b>  Go - this is SSH, and you can edit from samba. <br><br>  <i>6.1.</i>  <i>download afpd.tgz file</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* Post content to / public / applications / afpd /</i> <i><br></i>  <i>6.6.</i>  <i>We follow the path / public / applications / afpd /</i> <i><br></i>  <i>6.7.</i>  <i>Go to the conf directory</i> <i><br></i>  <i>6.8.</i>  <i>Edit the afpd.conf file - go to the last line and view,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>there are paths to different files in them may be incorrectly specified</i> <i><br></i>  <i>disk mount point - ide1 - forward it to your own, save the file</i> <i><br></i>  <i>6.8.1 I experimented, and personally changed this:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>a) noddp - nevertheless decided that it is the most correct option</i> <i><br></i>  <i>b) -guestname guest - removed it altogether, because by default it should put nobody</i> <i><br></i>  <i>c) added the setpassword parameter so that users can change passwords themselves</i> <i><br></i>  <i>6.9.</i>  <i>Edit the AppleVolumes.default file - the format is simple: first go to the directories on the drive,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>then after allow: a list of logins separated by a comma to anyone.</i>  <i>save</i> <i><br></i>  <i>6.10.</i>  <i>Go back to the previous directory / afpd</i> <i><br></i>  <i>6.11.</i>  <i>Execute commands:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>6.11.1 rm ./conf/afppasswd</i> <i><br></i>  <i>6.11.2 ./bin/afppasswd -c -p ./conf/afppasswd</i> <i><br></i>  <i>6.11.3Now we set passwords for accounts, regardless of the standard setting</i> <i><br></i>  <i>./bin/afppasswd -a -p ./conf/afppasswd account_name</i> <i><br></i>  <i>and enter the password twice.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(here is an ambush, for some reason I did not allow to enter complex passwords,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>only simple ones like 123456 or qwerty, but qwerty1234 does not give)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>the problem with the password was solved only by allowing the user to change his password,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>and this change allows you to generate any passwords (set the minimum length limit in afpd.conf)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* Run init</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  I also failed to set complex passwords.  Akak did not change them myself.  Tell me who knows. <br><br>  Next, put avahi as written again there. <br><br>  <i>7.1.</i>  <i>download avahi.tgz file</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* Copy to the folder / public / applications / avahi /</i> <i><br></i>  <i>7.6.</i>  <i>We follow the path / public / applications / avahi / conf</i> <i><br></i>  <i>7.7.</i>  <i>Editing the file /public/applications/avahi/conf/Avahi-deamon.conf</i> <i><br></i>  <i>7.7.1 I edited the parameter: host name - specified the name that should be displayed in the network environment</i> <i><br></i>  <i>7.7.2 deleted the line domain-name = local - by default it will substitute</i> <i><br></i>  <i>7.7.3 changed rlimit-nofile = 30 to rlimit-nofile = 20 because</i>  <i>in the description they write:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>‚ÄúAvahi-daemon shouldn't need more than 15 to 20 open file descriptors concurrently.‚Äù</i> <i><br></i>  <i>7.7.4 changed rlimit-nproc = 3 to rlimit-nproc = 5 so that with a margin was))))</i> <i><br></i>  <i>7.8.</i>  <i>Remove excess registration in DNS</i> <i><br></i>  <i>7.8.1 enter the service directory</i> <i><br></i>  <i>7.8.2 transfer all * .service files (except of course afpd.service)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>from current directory to disabled directory</i> <i><br></i>  <i>(of course you can just delete it, but then suddenly we want to raise something else)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>* Run init</i> <i><br></i> <br><br>  After that, I got AFP coverage right away.  Now you need to create a special image so that you can backup our belongings to Time Machine.  It is done this way.  You need to allow it to backup to network drives with the command <br><br>  defaults write com.apple.systempreferences TMShowUnsupportedNetworkVolumes 1 <br><br>  They say you need to rebut.  I put it up a year ago, when I backed up onto a Windows disk, so I don‚Äôt know.  Rebuild the MAC, not the device, and perform the following.  First find out your MAC address ethernet. <br><br>  ifconfig |  grep ether <br><br>  sudo hdiutil create -size <b>$ GIG</b> g-type SPARSEBUNDLE -nospotlight -volname "Backup of My Mac" -fs "Case-sensitive Journaled HFS +" -verbose ./ <b>$ Computername_MACaddress</b> <br><br>  In this $ GIG command, replace with the maximum size in gigabytes, $ Computername with the name of your computer on the network, and MACaddress with the known MAC address without colons.  It turns out something like mycomputer_001234567890. <br><br>  This will create a 150 meter file that you want to copy to the device.  To disk where you want to backup.  After, show Time Machine on it, and it all worked for me. <br><br>  <b>(6) BACKUP WITH HOSTING</b> <br><br>  On a poppy, I use rsync and back up files from hosting from time to time.  Delivered rsync through optware and made myself a script to back it up. <br><br>  #! / bin / sh <br>  su valyard <br>  rsync -zre ssh *** @ ***. ru: / home / *** / domains / mnt / ide2 / public / webbackup / <br><br>  To see through AFP, you need to backup under those from whom you enter and not under the root. <br><br>  <b>(7) TERRIBLE CATCHER</b> <br><br>  I do not know what to do and why, but with each reboot, i-Stor iS607 overwrites at least everything that was in my / root folder and completely forgets about all the settings.  At the same time, none of the autoruns that I know of do it.  Thank God it's not in the / mnt / ide2 folder.  So you have to write and restart everything again.  I wrote myself a script that I launch manually. <br><br>  #! / bin / sh <br>  ln -sf / mnt / ide2 / optware / / opt <br>  PATH = "$ PATH: / opt / bin: / opt / sbin" <br>  / mnt / ide2 / public / applications / afpd / init <br>  / mnt / ide2 / public / applications / avahi / init <br>  transmission-daemon -g / mnt / ide2 / public / config <br><br><h4>  Findings. </h4><br>  What can I say, it would be better if I assembled miniATX with Windows.  How to push the buttons I seem to know.  From the story it seems that I quickly nadybal information and put everything.  Nifiga  It is very difficult to find anything useful by i-Stor iS607.  I hope this post is indexed by search engines and desperate people will get here, because there is no official technical support. <br><br>  In general, I do not advise taking iS607.  This is some kind of unsupported clone is not clear what.  I was advised by WD MyBook World Edition, for which there is a whole community and you can ask someone.  But he is not such a simp and does not hold two disks.  Moreover, I already had a screw. <br><br>  But, still need to say that the device works.  After completion of the file.  And performs its functions.  If you do not pay attention to the braking and falling off samba.  Copy speed is normal.  By wiring, it reaches me up to 9 megabytes per second.  I think you can live.  For the sake of web muzzle transmission is definitely worth leaving. <br><br>  I'll get myself an external IP and will put torrents from work for download. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br>  If someone knows the best solutions and / or has any tips to make, feel free to write.  I look cautiously at Linux and he reciprocates me, so I will not pretend to be a powerful guru. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83548/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83548/</a></p>
