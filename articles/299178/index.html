  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What will your work become in 10 years</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Ten years ago, the world around us imperceptibly, but changed significantly.  Recall the 2006th.  Facebook has just opened a free registration for anyone with email, including companies.  Telephone calls and newsgroups as the primary means of business communication began to be supplanted by electronic correspondence and instant messengers.  In Fortune, the best places to work were not Google and the Boston Consulting Group, but the biotech giant Genentech and the Wegman grocery store chain. <br><br>  It is obvious that since 2006 a lot has changed, and the next decade promises even more fundamental changes.  Let's distract from the current work for a moment and try to look into the future so that it does not take us by surprise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/165/2e1/c37/1652e1c371ee453ca761c734b925dc3a.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  The border between the office and the house will blur </h3>

      Remember the endless rows of booths perpetuated in the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581_(%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB,_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590)">Office</a> series, filled with the harsh light of fluorescent lamps?  Already in our days, open planning is becoming the norm and stand-up jobs appear.  What will be next? <br><br>  <b>Your favorite chair will be in the office</b> <br>  FastCompany magazine has compiled a list of <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3054804/the-future-of-work/8-top-office-design-trends-for-2016">eight major trends in office design</a> .  In particular, experts noted the increasing importance of the elements of comfort and coziness: fireplaces, comfortable chairs and specially equipped recreation areas to relieve stress.  Offices will get rid of cables, power cords and other accessories that create a sense of confusion.  We are also promised a proliferation of universal modular jobs that can be easily transformed or tailored to growth. <br><br>  <b>The workplace will be a transformer</b> <br>  If you think about your office, then immediately imagine its layout.  But, according to futurologist Jacob Morgan, it will not always be like that.  He <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/12/03/how-the-physical-workspace-impacts-the-employee-experience/">notes</a> that companies will begin to treat physical space in the same way as software that requires constant updates.  Business will stop spending money on expensive redevelopment, calculated for centuries.  Organizations will also be interested <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/12/03/how-the-physical-workspace-impacts-the-employee-experience/">in personalization technologies</a> , including workplaces to which information on preferred lighting and air temperature for each individual employee, as well as all his contacts, projects and necessary files can be transmitted. <br><br>  <b>Maintenance of offices will be cheaper</b> <br>  The development of the <a href="https://www.wrike.com/blog%3Fp%3D402584">Internet of Things</a> will make it possible to determine the presence of people in rooms, to turn off the lights and air conditioning in empty rooms, warn cleaners about which of the offices have not been used and do not need cleaning, and <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3052936/the-future-of-work/how-the-internet-of-things-is-changing-work">increase the efficiency of office space</a> . <br><br>  <b>The offices themselves will start to die</b> <br>  Monday morning will catch you at work at home, in the library or in the nearest cafe.  According to Time, services such as Dropbox, Skype and other collaboration tools (including <a href="https://www.wrike.com/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblogposts%26utm_campaign%3Dwork_future">Wrike</a> ) will contribute to the <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1898024_1898023,00.html">disappearance of traditional offices</a> and the emergence of an increasing number of freelancers, independent contractors and remote teams.  Companies are fully aware of their benefits if employees no longer have to spend 1-2 hours every day on the way to the office, renting which is very expensive.  Employees, for their part, generally welcome the opportunity to work from home.  In addition, this trend contributes to decentralization and has a good effect on the development of provincial cities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85c/c5a/789/85cc5a789787441a8fbe2dd993a9e0ca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  New software, new habits </h3><br><br>  Technology development will remain the main driver of change.  The popularity of mobile devices, social networks and wearable technology is already changing the way people interact with colleagues, customers and employers.  Further more. <br><br>  <b>You will become a corporate social network user.</b> <br>  If before there was a clear boundary between your life in social networks and life in the office, in the coming years it will begin to erase and disappear completely, as companies are already <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3054347/the-future-of-work/5-trends-that-will-change-how-companies-use-social-media-in-2016">introducing internal social networks</a> , such as Slack and Facebook At Work. <br><br>  <b>Your phone will become the most important work tool.</b> <br>  Nowadays, 44% of employees use mobile devices for work more than 20 times a day, and 70% believe that they will use them more often in the future.  Mobile technology helps us not to drown in work tasks.  In any case, 69% of respondents who admit to using mobile devices at work claim that it saves or even improves the balance of work and personal time. <br><br>  <b>And you have to follow the rules of the company when working with your own phone.</b> <br>  According to our data, about 62% of employees already use personal mobile devices for work.  They, like their employers, face the difficult task of implementing and enforcing rules and measures to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3052289/the-future-of-work/is-your-smartphone-putting-your-employer-at-risk">protect confidential business information on such devices</a> . <br><br>  <b>The popularity of collaboration tools will grow</b> <br>  Collaboration applications that allow remote teams to work with entire teams and departments have already become familiar and are being used by an increasing number of companies.  To implement such tools and encourage employees to work with them, companies will add value to such services in the eyes of end users, emphasizing <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/11/25/the-number-one-way-to-get-employees-to-use-collaboration-technologies/">individual benefits</a> (flexible scheduling, recognition of achievements, etc.) rather than forcing people to feel important for the company (accelerating innovation, productivity growth, etc.). <br><br>  <b>You will have an "electronic butler"</b> <br>  Services like Siri and Cortana are becoming ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù and more functional.  Very soon we will have <a href="http://www.thefutureorganization.com/three-technologies-that-will-disrupt-the-workplace/">personal assistants based on artificial intelligence</a> at work.  They will study and predict our behavioral patterns and provide the necessary information in advance to increase your productivity. <br><br>  <b>Wearable devices and the Internet of things will be used at work.</b> <br>  Daily routine tasks such as making coffee or turning on the lights <a href="http://www.thefutureorganization.com/three-technologies-that-will-disrupt-the-workplace/">will be performed automatically</a> so that employees are not distracted from more complex and creative things.  <a href="http://www.thefutureorganization.com/three-technologies-that-will-disrupt-the-workplace/">Wearable devices</a> will tell employees when to take a break, and what products should be avoided in the diet in order to maintain maximum performance.  And companies will begin to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/11/01/the-top-8-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-future-of-work/">analyze the</a> collected data on the activities, moods and habits of employees, in order to find out how to increase employee productivity and employee satisfaction, without becoming like Big Brother. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eb9/1eb/e71/eb91ebe71e524d3dac7b42298136dd41.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Work organization methods will be softer </h3><br><br>  Not only the tools and technologies that we use will change, but also our attitude to work and the methods of its implementation.  In the next few years, companies will adopt new management technologies, values ‚Äã‚Äãand standards. <br><br>  <b>Three business areas will appear.</b> <br>  In a <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/managing-tomorrows-people/future-of-work/assets/pdf/future-of-rork-report-v16-web.pdf">recent report,</a> PriceWaterhouseCooper predicted that the companies of the future could be attributed to three areas: <br>  The "blue sphere" of capitalism, where the main priority are indicators of profit and market share. <br>  ‚ÄúGreen Sphere‚Äù, where employees and customers demand from the organization concern for the environment and human well-being and the desire to change life for the better. <br>  The "orange sphere" of small enterprises, freelancers and entrepreneurs, primarily focused on economical and flexible working methods. <br><br>  <b>Companies will become smaller and flatter.</b> <br>  More and more new companies <a href="https://medium.com/the-wtf-economy/this-is-your-life-in-10-years-time-67b4ec88a4b2">will try to keep</a> their initial small size.  The staff will include a basic group of founders and key employees, and the rest of the necessary roles will be performed by freelancers from around the world.  At the same time, large companies will take to simplify the organizational structure and try to introduce a horizontal management style <a href="https://www.wrike.com/blog%3Fp%3D404959">similar to the ‚Äúholacracy‚Äù adopted by Zappos</a> .  As a result, employees will get more authority to manage projects, get rid of a rigid job hierarchy, and be able to make a more significant contribution to the development of the company. <br><br>  <b>The concept of "entrepreneur" will acquire a new meaning.</b> <br>  Just as the methods of project management <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3054546/the-future-of-work/the-four-trends-that-will-change-the-way-we-work-by-2021">change, our ideas about entrepreneurship change too</a> .  Entrepreneurs will no longer be called exclusively by those who create new products or establish companies.  Now this definition includes independent freelancers who are joining together with other freelancers into a temporary group to carry out a larger and more profitable project. <br><br>  <b>Experiments and iterative processes will become the norm.</b> <br>  Companies will adopt a <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/11/01/the-top-8-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-future-of-work/">research style of work</a> and will pay less attention to improving standard processes and products, and more to experimenting and creating innovation. <br><br>  <b>Distract from work?</b>  <b>No more having to do it in secret</b> <br>  Organizations are beginning to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3049814/the-future-of-work/why-letting-employees-slack-off-can-be-good-for-business">appreciate and even encourage pauses in work</a> , when you can get distracted by something else and eventually discover curious relationships that lead to the emergence of new ideas.  In companies such as Google, employees have long been given time to carry out side projects and satisfy curiosity.  This practice is becoming more popular as management begins to care about the performance and motivation of its staff. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48d/514/685/48d5146854df440cbb4db1fddd95c38f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Multifunctionality and communication skills will be valued higher. </h3><br><br>  As modern tools and technologies open up new possibilities and methods of work, the skills we need become more and more non-trivial, and communication skills become more and more popular. <br><br>  <b>"Hygonomics" will open up new opportunities</b> <br>  Some of the most sought-after professions in the next decade <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3046277/the-new-rules-of-work/the-top-jobs-in-10-years-might-not-be-what-you-expect">will be associated with evolving ‚Äúgigonomy‚Äù or an economy of free earnings</a> .  Among such professions is a personal brand creation instructor, helping freelancers and consultants to sell their services, or traiber, helping companies form ideal working groups to carry out specific projects.  Even teachers and professors will become freelancers and will choose to collaborate with one of the many online training platforms. <br><br>  <b>You will often update your resume</b> <br>  The times when a person could work up to retirement in one and only company, making their way up the career ladder to the very top, are fading.  <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/05/29/what-the-future-of-work-looks-like/">Representatives of the next generation will change jobs at least ten times before reaching the age of forty</a> .  It will be common for a company to work on a company for several years, gain experience and knowledge, and then grab for a more attractive opportunity. <br><br>  It will not be enough to have a single skill and use it throughout the entire work experience - you will have to master various skills and be able to use them according to the situation.  <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3054546/the-future-of-work/the-four-trends-that-will-change-the-way-we-work-by-2021">Short-term refresher courses</a> for a year or a few months will be particularly popular, and over time, both employers and employees will become accustomed to a high level of turnover. <br><br>  <b>Among the working skills will appear experience in World of Warcraft</b> <br>  The ability to make collective decisions, especially in a distributed team, will be appreciated very highly.  <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1898024_1898023,00.html">This is very rarely taught in traditional business schools, but fans of MMORPG and other online games have mastered this skill perfectly</a> . <br><br>  <b>Keep your IQ, EQ and CQ ready</b> <br>  The growth of globalization and the growing diversity of personnel means that not only high IQ and well-developed emotional intelligence (EQ) are necessary for successful people management and teamwork, but also <a href="https://www.wrike.com/blog%3Fp%3D400371">cultural intelligence</a> (CQ) and cultural sensitivity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/665/0ad/89b/6650ad89bc5c4808968d84fe1af8c396.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  The success of the company will depend on the culture </h3><br><br>  Flexible work schedules, remote work and the need to motivate talented employees to keep them in the company, forcing employers to devote more time and resources to create a corporate culture, thanks to which employees will want to come to the office. <br><br>  <b>Colleagues will become members of the community</b> <br>  Today, <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/05/29/what-the-future-of-work-looks-like/">more than 87% of employees admit that they do not like their job</a> , and this means that the problem is not to hire a talented specialist, but to retain him.  Companies will make more efforts to create a genuine sense of ownership, to inspire employees and foster their dedication to their team. <br><br>  <b>Mutual evaluation will become standard</b> <br>  <a href="https://www.wrike.com/blog%3Fp%3D406288">Traditional certification methods are a thing of the past</a> , as companies are beginning to use more flexible ways of getting feedback and evaluating employees.  Organizations will pay <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3054547/the-future-of-work/six-companies-that-are-redefining-performance-management">more attention to mentoring</a> and advanced training, allow employees to set goals for themselves, and also begin to collect internal feedback on an ongoing basis in order to stimulate the development of all company employees, up to senior management. <br><br>  <b>Benefits will be more</b> <br>  Medical insurance, paid vacation and other usual benefits will not go anywhere.  Moreover, more and more companies are starting to add <a href="https://www.wrike.com/blog%3Fp%3D403330">personal benefits</a> to them, depending on the corporate culture and personal circumstances of the employee.  Employers rethink traditional benefits and compensations in order to give their employees what they really need, such as <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3054379/the-future-of-work/this-is-what-the-best-places-to-work-and-the-happiest-companies-have-in-c">paid leave to care for a child</a> , the <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1898024_1898023,00.html">possibility of lifelong learning,</a> and <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3054749/the-future-of-work/is-student-loan-repayment-the-new-401k">assistance in paying an education loan</a> . <br><br>  <b>Fight for gender and cultural diversity will gain momentum</b> <br>  In companies such as Facebook and Pinterest, there is a requirement for every open management position to consider a resume of at least one woman and one representative of underrepresented minorities, and Twitter and Pinterest publish their selection decisions in open access for greater transparency.  Many companies will follow their example, as their interest in <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3053881/the-future-of-work/7-lessons-from-facebook-pinterest-and-google-on-building-diverse-teams">increasing cultural diversity in working teams is</a> constantly growing. <br><br>  As a result, they will begin to take measures to combat unwitting prejudices, for example, to conduct blind interviews when applicants and employees conducting interviews cannot see each other and their voices are distorted. <br><br>  <b>HR managers will begin to assess the compliance of the applicant with the corporate culture</b> <br>  When you once again begin to look for work, your experience, diplomas and certification points will no longer be so important in comparison with motivation, set goals and the desire to learn.  <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3054756/the-future-of-work/how-youll-search-for-a-job-in-2016">The main issue will be your ability to fit into the cultural environment</a> . <br><br>  Perhaps you yourself will be able to create a suitable position (the trend has already received its BYOP abbreviation - Build Your Own Position), relying on their own interests and industry experience.  First, you establish a relationship with the company, and then create a role for yourself, instead of applying for a free job. <br><br>  <b>You will become more picky in choosing an employer.</b> <br>  Salary is no longer a decisive factor when choosing a job.  Since job seekers <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3054546/the-future-of-work/the-four-trends-that-will-change-the-way-we-work-by-2021">will choose companies that fit their lifestyle, values, and professional interests</a> , organizations <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/11/01/the-top-8-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-future-of-work/">will try to create a sense of importance and meaningfulness in the work they do</a> .  However, the specific steps that will be taken in this direction are rather difficult to describe, and even more difficult to implement. <br><br>  <b>We will see more women among top managers.</b> <br>  <a href="http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1898024_1898023,00.html">Studies show</a> that women leaders are more cooperative than competitive, have higher emotional intelligence and are committed to building long-term relationships.  In the face of the threatening shortage of talented specialists, the fact that there are more diploma holders and academic degrees among women, and also the fact that they acquire 83% of consumer goods, means one thing: there should be more women in business who can cooperate with other women and sell them goods.  However, here Russia is already a <a href="http://www.grantthornton.global/press/press-releases-2015/women-in-business-2015/">world leader</a> and one foot in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d05/f9c/e09/d05f9ce09e86403098b6238bee6ad550.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  It's time to learn to work remotely </h3><br><br>  According to statistics, the era of teleworking has already begun and the end is not yet in sight: <a href="http://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics">80-90% of employees express a desire to work from home at least part of the work week, and 50% say that they already have this opportunity</a> .  In the next few years, more effective methods of remote collaboration will be created, which will allow to achieve such a level of cooperation and social interaction, which is currently available only in the office. <br><br>  <b>Remote work will be the norm, not the exception</b> <br>  Instead of using the services of separate groups of remote specialists or allowing employees to work from home from time to time, <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/3052836/the-future-of-work/6-ways-work-will-change-in-2016">companies will focus on remote work from the very beginning</a> .  Any face-to-face communication will be an exception to the rule, and companies will actively introduce technologies that will allow hiring talented professionals regardless of their place of residence. <br><br>  <b>You change your home to make it easier to work.</b> <br>  In many residential buildings, an open layout is used, which is not very convenient for concentrated and efficient work.  Increasingly, working remotely, people <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-the-future-of-working-at-home-may-look-like-1448248050">will begin to equip work space in their homes</a> . <br><br>  <b>Offices will be used only as collaboration sites.</b> <br>  Separate desks and office cells will become unnecessary, because offices will turn into <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/careers/ct-biz-0629-work-advice-huppke-20150626-column.html">platforms for collaboration</a> .  People will come there only to work in a team. <br><br><h3>  What do you think about the work of the future? </h3><br><br>  We described only general trends, but it is clear that each company sees its future in its own way.  <a href="https://www.wrike.com/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dblogposts%26utm_campaign%3Dwork_future">Wrike</a> is a project management and collaboration service, so for us such predictions are not just curiosity, but also part of business planning. <br><br>  It is important for us to constantly evaluate successful methods suitable for specific organizations and their employees, and look for ways to solve problems, and your predictions in the comments are warmly welcome! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299178/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299178/</a></p>
