  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Guessing on the Mark Zuckerberg</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A month ago, Mark Zuckerberg said he wanted to move from the social network format for friends and family to the global social infrastructure format.  Then many people got fucked on it - for abstract ideas, for the inconsistency of desires, for their great contribution to the creation of problems that they now intend to solve ... <br><br>  But in fact, the February announcement was not so much announced as fixed the direction in which Mark has been going on for more than a month.  The contradiction and confusion of the manifesto says only that he feels the direction in which it is time to change the network, but he still does not see specific ways.  In general, for this purpose there is a construction of a ‚Äúmission‚Äù in business terminology.  It is something like a goal that cannot be expressed in specific directions, but you can try to invest in a certain image.  Zuckerberg on the example of competitors, the main one of which is Snapchat, saw that users didn‚Äôt have enough to pile up - they needed a window to the world.  But Zuckerberg himself said: ‚ÄúIf you use Facebook, you usually have 30 or 40 groups, of which only one or two really important that you actively use them.  People are not looking for other people to communicate. ‚Äù  Now Facebook will purposefully identify leaders and popularize their ideas and activities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/10f/7bc/5cd/10f7bc5cd60348d7b6e0c9817633b43d.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  If you look from a marketing perspective, Facebook has reached the saturation limit of the main markets, the network life cycle has reached its peak.  You can stay at the maximum (?) For a long time, but a specific period depends on the success of competitors and their ability to respond to new requests and user habits, which Facebook cannot fully embody.  This is a well-known leader's dilemma - there is a risk of losing, having chased after changes early  and there is a risk of being late, giving the future functionality to competitors.  It is only necessary to recognize it.

      Mark recognizes the trends quite well, judging by the purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, but he doesn‚Äôt launch very well.  The prolonged transfer of users from the application to the instant messenger for several years is an example of this.  Perhaps the whole thing in a bet on a conservative retention of the audience with a gradual growth, rather than on growth through experiments.  Losing 1% of 2 billion users to attract even 10%, but of the 100 million who have shown interest in a new functionality in a separate application from a competitor, is a luxury that the exchange company cannot afford.  For this reason, Mark can not offer anything cardinal in his social network, but carries the Internet and Facebook to poor and remote countries, and also expands the product line within his brand, quickly retreating if the audience does not pick them up.  The habitual scenario of behavior sits tightly in their heads and few people succeed in changing their behavior on the network.  People do not join the entire functionality of the social network, but to the familiar audience and to the specific, usual way of dialogue. <br><br>  In recent years, we can recall such ideas of Mark as: <br><br><ul><li>  make the network a platform for news from media and entertainment from media companies </li><li>  make the network a video content provider </li><li>  make the network an online video feed </li><li>  opening of specialized groups for the sale of goods </li></ul><br>  All of these features are functioning, but they are not ‚Äúanchor‚Äù.  Even a gaming hub or application connection does not make any significant profit. <br><br><h2>  So the new mission and manifesto here with it? </h2><br>  In a sense, a mission is a business plan in the most capacious form.  No specifics, but employees receive a guideline against which to check a lot of small decisions.  Descending the search for solutions to the level of employees is the goal of forming a new mission.  Mark himself has no complete perception.  The manifesto turned out to be big, confused and controversial.  And in no way resembles a clear vision of new directions of development, although some general priorities are outlined there. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c0e/404/a07/c0e404a07bfd444c9cfeeac3af718aec.png"><br><br>  Some made fun of Mark for conceit and ambition, others criticized for technological determinism.  In particular, Mark was honored with a <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/%3Fp%3D7651">rebuke</a> from a fairly well-known writer on the subject of information technology <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2580,_%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581">Nicholas Carr</a> .  According to Nicholas, belief in technology is shortsighted, and most importantly, no single infrastructure can unite in a single network such local communities as religious denominations or sports fans, as different from the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãexternal communications.  Not to mention the integration of the communication goals of xenophobic and criminal associations.  Meanwhile, the involvement of different cultures and opinions in the dialogue is one of the 5 priorities of the social network mission. <br><br>  These priorities do not form a holistic product: <br><br><ul><li>  development of mutual support </li><li>  security </li><li>  awareness (break the cocoon of filters in which the user communicates within the network, mark fake news) </li><li>  civil activity </li><li>  involvement of people from different cultures and perspectives </li></ul><br>  As far as I understand, any project management or product scientist will criticize this plan as passionately as Mark got from publicists and sociologists.  So projects are not described, and products are not launched.  The plan must be clarified, remove the contradictions, draw the connection.  Once again, the impression that Mark feels the direction, but only that. <br><br>  In many of the areas already have an activity.  Alerts about the dangers and health of friends, marking dubious news, warning of suicides - all this is implemented.  Mark has a lot of experimentation - from a virtual stadium for sharing the competition to a fresh ban for application developers, banks and advertisers to collect information about user behavior.  Here again we have to mention Snapchat.  All his improvements become drivers of growth, Facebook‚Äôs audience is growing due to market power - the leader‚Äôs snowball involves friends of already existing users.  Tired of trying to independently monitor and reproduce, Mark wants to involve the entire mass of his employees in the creative copying of ideas. <br><br>  In management and marketing they even invented a special entity - the mission of the company.  This is the image on which it is necessary to be equal in constant action.  We can wean from specific instructions, but we must give new ones, plus follow the process of change.  It is much safer to do this smoothly, leaving employees to gently and gradually change their working procedures. <br><br>  Two things are interesting in the manifesto - the desire to become a window to the world and some practical steps to form groups.  Namely, the development of medical groups that unite patients on the basis of similar diseases.  To help members of groups to test their symptoms, artificial intelligence may be given.  Read more Mark is not voiced.  However, taking into account another large-scale project - the intention to solve all diseases (I certainly do not believe in it) and some funding allocated by the Mark Foundation for medical research, such groups can be the basis for the future telemedicine network when the core of Facebook users reaches 50-60 years old.  After all, if Mark doesn‚Äôt figure out how to rejuvenate his network and give up new generations to other tools, the medical platform will be a very valuable asset. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/324328/">https://habr.com/ru/post/324328/</a></p>
