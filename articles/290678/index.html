We develop tablets for business sites and we know that most sites for business need them - they just haven‚Äôt noticed it all yet.  And yet: your website is sick, and he needs medicine. <br><br> <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/krible/blog/15518/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b7/4b1/860/9b74b1860f4f410e9964a09696761f51.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In 2015, every hairdresser has a website.  But having a website for your business does not mean that this site actually works.  The question that web developers need to ask customers more often: why do you need a website?  Instead, they ask what functionality it needs, what it prefers in design, what kind of audience it has ... When the main thing is what expectations the website can fulfill for the business. <br><br>  In recent years, the situation is changing, but not fast enough.  Most of the sites, especially the old sites, built in the zero, were created on the principle of the famous experiment with five monkeys:

    <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The essence of the experiment</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>There are five monkeys in the cage.</i>  <i>A bunch of bananas is suspended from the ceiling, and under them stands a staircase.</i>  <i>Soon a monkey walks up the stairs to climb behind the banana.</i>  <i>As soon as she tries to rise, suddenly all the monkeys (and those who are sitting on the sidelines) under the pressure are doused with icy water.</i>  <i>When the monkeys calmed down, the other one tries to get the bananas again - and again all the monkeys are drenched.</i>  <i>After several repetitions, a conditioned reflex is produced, and the monkeys are no longer interested in bananas on the ceiling - they are more expensive.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A few days later, in the cage, one monkey was replaced by a new one.</i>  <i>A new monkey saw a banana, and naturally wanted to get it.</i>  <i>However, this attempt was severely suppressed by the old-timers of the cage.</i>  <i>After a good bashing, the novice understood that it is impossible to touch the bananas on the ceiling, and if she tries again, she will be severely punished.</i>  <i>Notice, at this stage, the water is no longer used.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The experience continued until all five monkeys were replaced by new ones (which were never watered).</i>  <i>But all the newbies have already been taught that for some reason you cannot touch a banana.</i>  <i>And when a new, sixth one was added to the ‚Äúnot drenched‚Äù monkeys, the effect was predictable: when a new girl immediately climbed onto the stairs behind a banana, she was beaten by her congeners.</i>  <i>Because you can't touch bananas.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>After replacing all of the original monkeys, none of the remaining monkeys were sprayed with cold water.</i>  <i>However, none of them came up to the stairs to get a banana.</i>  <i>Every time a new monkey tried to approach the stairs, it was stopped.</i>  <i>Many monkeys who beat her did not even know why they were not allowed to climb this ladder and why they were beating a new monkey.</i>  <i>They beat her simply because it is impossible!</i> </div></div><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61e/bae/103/61ebae103836468880b735538415b7df.jpg"><br><br>  Many business sites are made on the same principle: it already has a competitor.  We will make the site beautiful, there will be a location map, a description of how good we are, what services we provide - and after all, all this is PR and business cost optimization (for example, the operator does not need to waste time explaining the location map to the company's office). <br><br>  Well, something is changing.  The main trend of the tenth years in site building is the use of landing pages.  Landing idea has grown from presentations (a slide with a description of the problem, its solution, etc.), but its implementation is distinguished by a high density of contact information: the pages are simply stuffed with feedback forms, phone numbers, etc.  Small businesses have already realized that the most important thing is to get a customer, a call, a letter, a completed order form.  Medium and large business is just on the way. <br><br>  It is the elements of interaction with visitors that are the point to which you need to exert maximum efforts: you need to bring them to the contact, call, write to the chat.  This should be on all pages, in the header of the page and in the basement, in the middle of the page, in the menu - everything should call the client to action. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba1/9b2/14b/ba19b214bb494009a29f5a455bf6cd86.jpg"><br><br>  Otherwise, your site will work as in that joke: <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">About prayers and a lottery ticket</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <i>One Jew prayed to God for many years about winning the lottery.</i>  <i>But his prayers were in vain.</i>  <i>Then one day, he raised his gray head to heaven and with tears in his eyes asked:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Lord, I didn‚Äôt pray for you, I didn‚Äôt serve you, I didn‚Äôt lead a righteous life, so why don‚Äôt you give me what I have been asking you for so long?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Here the heavens open and God answers him:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- So you buy a ticket!</i> </div></div><br>  Nothing complicated: the fact that there are ways to contact and order on all pages of the site will already increase the effectiveness of its site. <br><br>  However, this is not all that can be done with your website in order to change its commercial performance for the better: <br><br>  <i>See how people take the newspaper "Metro" in the Moscow subway.</i>  <i>Packages are inserted in a container, anyone can come up and get a newspaper for free.</i>  <i>But it is necessary to approach the girls in the company apron, take the newspapers in their hands and start distributing them to the passing stream, then in five minutes the same number is distributed as before people took from the containers for 2 hours.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/017/fda/04e/017fda04e356496ca416e6362c678afd.jpg"><br><br>  The moral is obvious: active sales are better than passive ones! <br><br>  And now the question, which, probably, has already arisen with you, if you have read this far: <br><br><h2>  What, again to redo everything? </h2><br>  Not necessary.  We will not tell you about the problems that arise when remaking the site.  You are certainly familiar with them - not from your own experience, but from the experience of your friends and articles on the Internet.  But demand creates supply: and the demand for working sites has spawned technologies that allow increasing the conversion of visitors into customers without a major rework of the resource itself. <br><br>  You have already heard about most of these solutions: technical support chat rooms, callback forms.  You may have already tested or used similar technologies right now.  What we offer at <a href="http://www.krible.com/">Crible</a> brings them all together: <br><br><ul><li> dynamic chat with the manager, responsive to user actions, </li><li>  callback request upon user request </li><li>  Call directly from the site, bypassing the dialing on the phone </li></ul><br>  Krible technologies allow not to recycle the site completely, if you forgot to build in your site selling elements. <br><br>  We will turn your old site into a landing page: we will put a contact panel, which will always be in front of the visitor.  There will be an order form, a call back, a chat, and a couple of non-trivial tools that will probably come in handy in selling your services: <br><br>  <b>Teleportator</b> - a service that allows you to show the user products that may interest him in real time.  Yes, don‚Äôt describe the goods in the chat, don‚Äôt throw a link to the offer, but just before his eyes open the page with the new Mazda and tell about all its advantages by phone. <br><br>  <b>Nostradamus</b> - service predictor of the future purchase of the user.  Imagine, a previously registered user comes to your site, but for some reason a user who has not become your client.  What does it mean?  That's right - that he came back for something that he needed.  Nostradamus will inform you that the time has come for the user to make an offer that he cannot refuse - and by phone or in a chat - this is up to you. <br><br>  The main thing in these services is that they work to get the contact of the user and encourage him to dialogue.  Thus, even if you suddenly forgot to put sales elements on the site, it is never too late to add them using the Krible universal panel. <br><br>  And the last question that just appeared if you read this far: <i>but isn‚Äôt it already, all these widgets, pop-up windows and forms?</i>  <i>It annoys me - does it annoy the visitors too?</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/968/9d0/31a/9689d031a0244fe6ba9cb10fa128c705.jpg"><br><br>  But the company's website is not your personal car, where you like everything and do not get tired of anything, but official transport, whose task is to bring you money.  You spend a lot of money to attract a visitor to the site not so that he can relax with you, but to make a sale.  Moreover, if your advertisement is set up correctly, the user himself comes to your site because he wants to buy something.  Therefore, services like <a href="http://www.krible.com/">Krible</a> , provoking the client to make contact, are the main thing that should be on your site. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c35/f85/b5a/c35f85b5a0cb4063bb551e5db4baaea3.jpg"><br><br>  Try to cure the site with the help of the tablet Krible.  <a href="http://www.krible.com/">14 days free</a> . <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br> <a href="http://www.krible.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8fb/efe/52b/8fbefe52bc764636af4c1f6e1ee7241c.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290678/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290678/</a></p>
