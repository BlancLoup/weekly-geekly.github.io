      In the folder with the music offered by Dell, there were two songs - ‚ÄúHeliograph‚Äù and ‚ÄúInterstellar‚Äù.  They were authored by composer Sean Penn.  Internet users for a long time <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Music/comments/1mtgat/were_on_a_roll_reddit_has_found_the_ghost_rider/">could not identify the</a> person behind this name, but just two months ago, the author <a href="https://www.dell.com/community/Productivity-Software/Dell-Media-Experience-sample-music/td-p/1857513">appeared</a> on one of the Dell-thematic forums.  He said that he continues to write music, but under the pseudonym Edge Of The Universe.  <a href="https://soundcloud.com/edgeoftheuniverse">His recent work (as well as two tracks from Dell laptops)</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://w.soundcloud.com/player/" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  In addition to the songs of Sean, in the folder with the music from the manufacturer of laptops was another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DiX14BBejEVE">song</a> - the work of the cult American post-hardcore band <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Drive-In">At The Drive-In</a> - ‚ÄúRascuache‚Äù. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iX14BBejEVE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The group existed from 1993 to 2001, and then <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_the_Drive-In">decided to make a</a> ‚Äúbreak for an indefinite time,‚Äù ceasing performances at the peak of popularity.  However, in 2012 the team reunited - then they played a concert at the Coachella festival - and re-wrote the music. <br><br>  Two years ago, the band unveiled a new song, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DJoNJ6AQhmFY">Hostage Stamps</a> . <br><br><h2>  Digital players </h2><br>  The Sony Walkman MP3 players, released in the second half of the Zero, came with a large amount of pre-installed media content ‚Äî photos, videos, and music.  The owners of the devices were waiting for: the composition ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DpV7FyvCWdfM">Follow Through</a> ‚Äù by American folk singer Sasha Dobson, the ballad ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRml-0UPslMs">Ava Adele</a> ‚Äù by country singer Jack Ingram, and the hit group Spitalfield ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DeTopk71ty0Q">Secrets in Mirrors</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eTopk71ty0Q" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Subsequently, Sony continued the tradition with pre-installed music.  The Xperia X10 smartphone lineup has an even more unusual playlist.  The manufacturer uploaded to the device the creativity of the participants <a href="https://www.last.fm/music/Brett5000/%2Bwiki">of the Sony contest</a> for the best music video.  Genre works were significantly different.  For example, the composition ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DeysiXDEmLUQ">Journey</a> ‚Äù by Tranzpotter and indie pop ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dlk8bIrPQX5U">Static Space</a> ‚Äù by Erica Sunn was presented. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eysiXDEmLUQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Preloaded tracks were also on Microsoft Zune digital players.  They were supposed to become a competitor to the iPod, but the device failed to reach its audience, and its production was <a href="https://medium.com/%40shiriendamra/why-the-zune-failed-132784522ff0">stopped in 2011</a> .  Zune is interesting because it was a collection of songs from quite famous artists. <br><br><blockquote>  For example, there you could find Band of Horses with the song ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DmgG4HoXEtKo">Wicked Gil</a> ‚Äù, the track Small Sins ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNIEnX_n6MWk">Stay</a> ‚Äù and Every Move A Picture with their ‚Äú <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGArqqAgK9sQ">Signs Of Life</a> ‚Äù.  Also on the device <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2006/09/28/microsoft-to-put-zune-experience-in-consumers-hands-on-nov-14/">there were video clips of</a> such groups as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8yvGCAvOAfM">Thirty Seconds to Mars</a> , <a href="https://youtu.be/pDJKgi2e-Aw">Hot Chip</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DkCkiIrIucUo">Kinski</a> . </blockquote><br>  In this area, there is another player-manufacturer, Sandisk.  She is known for her memory cards, but their approach to preloaded music was different from what other companies were offering.  In addition to several <a href="https://forums.sandisk.com/t5/Sansa-View/Anyone-with-a-couple-minutes-Help-Much-Appreciated/m-p/14957%3Fview%3Dby_date_ascending%2523M1156">tracks</a> , like Stroke 9 " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DIb2SK6r4aKk">Next Time</a> " and The Slip " <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DKKhV1Z1nylo">Even Rats</a> ", <a href="https://forums.sandisk.com/t5/SanDisk-Clip-Sport-Plus/Any-Else-s-New-Clip-Sport-Plus-Come-With-Music-amp-Audiobook/td-p/358569">podcast releases were</a> downloaded to the players. <br><br><h2>  Various devices </h2><br>  By the way, the trend for pre-set songs did not bypass the ‚Äúsmart watch‚Äù with the ability to play music.  The TomTom brand, known for its products for active lifestyle lovers, has joined forces with the Ministry of Sound network of clubs to offer its customers a mix for practicing in the gym.  In addition, visitors to fitness sessions received <a href="https://lambon.co.uk/work/ministry-sound-tomtom-spark-website/">a</a> ¬£ 40 <a href="https://lambon.co.uk/work/ministry-sound-tomtom-spark-website/">discount</a> on the purchase of ‚Äúsmart watches‚Äù. <br><br>  Today, we no longer see such marketing solutions, but things can change with the advent of new applications and products that can compete with streaming services.  One of their main tasks can be to help the audience in the process of searching for new artists and forming curated collections of thematic music and podcasts. <br><br><hr><br>  <b>Materials on the topic from our blog on Habr√©:</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lc/ev/ev/lcevevvhrpxsnxownufk6ykmvma.png">  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/459102/">Record as a gift or free music for cola lovers and breakfast cereals</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lc/ev/ev/lcevevvhrpxsnxownufk6ykmvma.png">  <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/audiomania/blog/456848/">What kind of music was "sewn up" in popular OS</a> <br><br>  <b>And our "World Hi-Fi":</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png">  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6701.html">Pay what you want: how this model manifested itself in music</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png">  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6730.html">How an IT company fought for the right to sell music</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1o/sf/72/1osf72wkwrjhzpl2bwl5hcmwnbq.png">  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-6688.html">What was on the first iPod: twenty albums that Steve Jobs chose in 2001</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/459882/">https://habr.com/ru/post/459882/</a></p>
