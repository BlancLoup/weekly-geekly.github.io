      You can blame all the power, from the president to the last official, but nothing will change in the country. <br><br>  How many times each of us, looking at the performance of some ‚Äúpolitician‚Äù, wanted to shout: ‚ÄúBut shut up, finally!  Stop talking!  Do anything useful! ‚Äù <br><br>  It seems that all emotions are in vain, and nothing has to be expected from the authorities!  Our celestials - ministers, politicians, deputies - have everything!  They want to quietly sit out in their seats until retirement.  They do not care either for the roads or for us! <br><br>  In trying to "reach heaven", many of us have tried all available methods.  They wrote to the ministries, wrote to the Duma, wrote to the president.  Not a single letter has become without an ‚Äúanswer‚Äù if it is possible to recognize as such a formal reply notifying that the proposal, for example, ‚Äúhas been submitted to the relevant committee for consideration and will be necessarily taken into account in further legislative work‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What work ?!  After all, who, as they say, is now there!  Nothing changes for the better in the country!  So whose country is Russia?  Ours, or those elected, who do not understand how to win the election? <br><br>  Gradually, the decision came to give up on officials and deputies, and on all the rest from among those who hold power.  Let them live as they want!  We will create our Duma, our Government.  We will choose our President.  We will write our own - not idiotic, but really necessary and painful laws.  The collective intelligence of the Internet is much more powerful than the stagnating convolutions of 19 ministers and 450 deputies. <br><br>  No sooner said than done.  This is how the site <a href="http://alterrussia.ru/">‚ÄúIf I were the President‚Äù appeared</a> , which we submit to the community of respected users. <br><br>  Of course, just from his presence on the network, nothing will change.  But if it appears at least a dozen of truly national laws, for which everyone will vote - this is already a political factor that neither officials nor deputies can brush aside! <br><br><h4>  How does everything work? </h4><br><br>  The project is designed as a social network for the discussion and preparation of laws - the virtual republic of Alter Russia. <br><br>  After registration, the user receives "citizenship" and the opportunity to introduce for discussion their laws, their legislative initiatives, their amendments to the laws already in force. <br><br>  No need to write dozens of pages.  You can limit yourself to hundreds of other characters.  It is only important that the essence of your idea is clear to everyone else. <br>  Your proposal is submitted for discussion, after which all citizens of the virtual republic vote "for" or "against" it. <br><br>  For each comment, for each initiative approved by the community, rating points are awarded.  Those who gain the most points become a presidential candidate.  The candidate who gets the most votes in an election becomes President of the Republic of Alter Russia. <br><br>  <i>(Here I would like to say that every President of Alter Russia receives official congratulations and valuable gifts from the President and the Chairman of the Russian Government, and is also credited to the personnel reserve for the replacement of the highest posts in the state. Alas, this is not yet, but we are working hard on it! )</i> <br><br>  In general, join.  Sign up.  Test it.  Comment on.  Vote and propose your initiatives, your laws.  For our part, we will try to do everything to make the site more convenient.  So that none of the accepted proposals would be left without the attention of those officials, deputies and ministers who are supposed to deal with this issue by virtue of their official duties. <br><br>  Together we will not let them sleep!  We make them work for people! <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118470/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118470/</a></p>
