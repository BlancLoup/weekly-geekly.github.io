It so happened that over the years of training activities, quite a lot of such useful tools have been accumulated that solve various managerial problems and situations. <br><br>  The first articles at once somehow gained decent pluses, and we had the idea to make a separate product and a workshop on how to work systematically with people using tools.  Over the past 4 months, 10 articles have been published (the full list is at the bottom of this post), and as they are published we received several hundred positive and constructive comments (for which a special thank you!).  That only strengthened us in understanding that the product and the workshop are needed.

      And today - hip-hip hooray! <br><br>  We open registration in the program <a href="http://stratoplan.ru/pmf/">‚ÄúFormula of working with people‚Äù</a> , the intellect card of which we just <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/stratoplan/blog/214171/">published last week</a> . <br><br>  You ask, where is the promised analyst?  So ... As you know, when you have a good hammer, any problem begins to resemble a nail.  :) And this is the main problem of experts and coaches who are trying to sell this hammer to everyone. <br><br>  Therefore, we conducted a small survey of which problems with people are the most painful and important for you.  We were answered by <b>832 people</b> from among our clients and subscribers - employees of the most different (mainly IT) companies. <br><br>  After that, we spent a week analyzing the results, deleting repetitions and meaningful combining.  The result was <b>126 major problems and issues in working with people</b> . <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  1.
