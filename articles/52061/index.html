  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Selection of a team for project execution</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I want to talk about our attempt to answer the question that each customer asks himself, who plans to implement his project with the involvement of external executors: outsourcing teams.  It will be about medium-sized projects, within which you want to implement a fairly complex application, and small teams that carry out projects to order. <br><br>  First of all, the customer is interested in the previous experience of the teams, their productivity, the project implementation timeframe and the cost of the work, in order to complete the project successfully and minimize their own expenses. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Independent and small tasks may well be performed by freelancers, the result of which can be observed in numerous portfolios on freelance sites.  In this case, the result of the work on design, printing, website development is often quite simple to assess just by looking at the work.  But what about applications that are not placed on the site or not transferred to the customer for review?  The line in the summary: ‚Äúhe took part in the development of an enterprise-level management system‚Äù says practically nothing about the performer, except that the subject area is known to him.  Moreover, the fact of participation does not indicate the nature and quality of participation in the project.  One team can write an application a year, and another similar application - three months. <br><br>  We have tried to provide the customer and developers with a tool that will allow us to objectively assess the level of a team or an individual contractor based on the projects they have completed.  As examples, I will use links to real projects to demonstrate how this works.

      <b>What can the customer know about the team?</b> <br><br>  The customer begins to get acquainted with the performers on the basis of a rating, a less objective indicator based on real work results. <br><br>  Projects executed by participants or teams are listed in their profiles.  The customer can get a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe implemented functionality and the appearance of the user interface on <a href="http://projectscloud.ru/site/GSK/">the project page</a> . <br><br>  Using statistical indicators for the project, calculated <a href="http://devprom.ru/">by the project management system</a> (the number of tasks, iterations, releases), the customer estimates its size and complexity.  Indicators of the speed and efficiency of the team, characterize the possible productivity of project participants and the effectiveness of the project budget.  Burndown diagrams demonstrate the team‚Äôs commitment to meeting scheduled deadlines. <br><br>  If this is not enough for the customer, then you can ask the team to include him in the project as a customer and then he will have access to more detailed characteristics of the project and the participants.  The high transparency of the development process allows you to look into the history of the project and get a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the capabilities of the team that completed the project. <br><br>  The number of projects carried out by the team indicates its cohesion and stability, which can sometimes become the most important criterion. <br><br>  <b>As a performer to appear in the best light to the customer?</b> <br><br>  The basis for ranking participants and teams is the mechanism for calculating ratings, which take into account many indicators of participants: its social significance is participation in the community and third-party projects, its speed and efficiency indicators, calculated on the basis of completed projects. <br><br>  The rating is a kind of integral indicator of the level of an individual executor or team and is intended to represent the starting point for the customer.  Better understanding is achieved by the customer analyzing your projects.  The more your projects are maintained in the DEVPROM, the higher the rating, and the customer will approach the assessment of your level more accurately and versatile. <br><br>  <b>Nuances</b> <br><br>  The system has not yet implemented the ability to estimate the cost of the project and the work of the participants, but in the next iterations it will be implemented. <br><br>  Not all customers are ready to publish the results of projects, and often organize the process on their servers.  This makes it difficult to obtain an objective assessment of the project by an external user.  We are also thinking about how to better organize the transfer of statistical indicators to the devprom.ru site from such projects, maybe you have ideas? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/52061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/52061/</a></p>
