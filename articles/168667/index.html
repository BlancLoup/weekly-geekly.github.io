  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Briefly about hydrodynamics: do you remember how it all began?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  As the comments to the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/168411/">post</a> about hydrodynamic calculations on the tablet have shown, there is an objective need for a popular review of hydrodynamics as such.  Immediately it should be said that it is unlikely to be put in one post, and it seems that a small series of publications is to be created. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  However, let me begin, perhaps, with a story about the scientific school of hydrodynamics that took shape in the post-war years in Perm.  Now this school is widely known all over the world (naturally, in the relevant circles) for its huge fundamental developments in the field of equilibrium stability and fluid flow in a wide variety of conditions - in the presence of non-uniform heating (Rayleigh-Benard convection), concentration of impurity dissolved in a liquid (thermal diffusion , Marangoni convection), the impact on the vessel of vibrations of different directions (vibration and thermovibration convection), staying on top of each other two layers of immiscible liquids, convection  ivnyh trends in weightlessness under the influence of microgravity, and many others. <br><br>  At the same time, the liquid itself can either freely splash in the vessel (just hydrodynamics), or leak through sponges, filters, rocks (filtration theory), etc. A separate, not less powerful than the whole school (but still growing out of it) group researchers located at the Institute of Continuous Media Mechanics of the Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences and deals with magnetic hydrodynamics (for example, the flow of molten metal under the influence of a magnetic field, if applied, or the movement of plasma on scales from small experimental facilities to galactic  to the Universe), including conducting a full-scale simulation of the emergence of the Earth‚Äôs magnetic field (dynamo problem) on a facility filled with liquid sodium, and also works in the field of the theory of turbulence.  By the will of fate, the author of the text, being a graduate student, himself belongs to the fresh generation of this school.

      And then, in 1946, in fact, the exiled Georgy Andreyevich Ostroumov, a scientist without a degree, assumed the position of Acting Deputy.  Head of the Department of General Physics at the then Molotov University.  He was exiled because in the 1930s.  in the wake of the repressions, he was first forced to leave the Central Radio Laboratory of the Trust for Low Current Plants and move first to the Maritime Research and Development Institute of Communications, then to the Research Institute of the Music Industry, in 1935, at the "invitation" of the NKVD, moved to Saratov, in 1937 it was still arrested and in 1943 spent in the camps (Belomorkanal, Usollag).  In 1943, he was released from Usollag, but left there at work, and finally, in 1945, he was sent to the Stalinugol Trust, from which he came to Molotov University. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/cc9/b42/751/cc9b4275147a44e0150acbbd951a15a3.jpg"><br>  <b>Ostroumov G.A.</b> <br><br>  Against the background of the War and its graduation, the University continued to work, releasing very little, but releasing.  Among the first post-war graduates was Grigori Zinovievich Gershuni, the future professor of the department of theoretical physics, who is considered the second founder of the Hydrodynamic School after Ostroumov.  About him will be discussed later.  Upon completion of the reorganization of the faculty, G.A.  Ostroumov decided to defend his dissertation, initially planning to use the materials obtained during his work at Stalinogol.  However, in January 1946, a message was given at the physical seminar about the anomalous temperature distribution in an oil well near the town of Krasnokamsk, which interested Georgiy Andreevich.  He guessed that the anomaly was caused by convection of the fluid. <br><br>  First, he prepared and conducted an experiment - a model of a well from a glass burette equipped with a system of thermocouples.  At the bottom of it added a small incandescent spiral for heating, on top attached to a large cooling tank.  When the model was insulated from the environment and certain heating conditions, the model was set to the same heat exchange mode (ie, temperature distribution) as in the well.  After the experiment, Ostroumov solved the ‚ÄúOstroumov problem‚Äù - he found the exact solution of the convection equations for his model. <br><br>  Note  <i>A burette is a thin graduated glass tube with a capacity of usually 50 ml, open at one end and fitted with a glass or teflon stopcock at the other.</i>  <i>(ru.wikipedia)</i> <br><br>  Having issued these results in the form of a master's thesis, G.A.  submitted it to the Council of the Physical Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences, and on April 12, 1947 in the presence of three opponents appointed by the Council, among whom was LD  Landau, defended her, immediately receiving the degree of doctor of physical and mathematical.  sciences! <br>  A year later, the Higher Attestation Commission approved this degree, and a year later, the Higher Attestation Commission approved Ostroumova as a professor. <br><br>  All this taken together led to the fact that the university was set in motion.  Not only the whole department of general physics was engaged in convection - it was occupied both by theoretical physicists and the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics.  In a short time, over several years, in the wake of Ostroumov‚Äôs success, several more PhD theses were defended.  In 1952, Ostroumov published a monograph ‚ÄúFree convection in the conditions of an internal problem‚Äù, where he presented all the results obtained and was recognized in the USSR scientific community as the ancestor of the direction of physical hydrodynamics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5a8/0f3/c62/5a80f3c6201d660197a878ed0ae129cd.jpg"><br>  <b>Shaposhnikov I.G.</b> <br><br>  Theorists actively continued work on hydrodynamics, despite the fact that Ivan Grigorievich Shaposhnikov, the metal physicist by activity profile, was in charge of the Department of Theoretical Physics; at one time the research group member Ye.K.  Zavoisky - the discoverer of the phenomenon of electron paramagnetic resonance, and therefore not deeply affected hydrodynamics.  The first theorists, hydrodynamics, steel G.Z.  Gershuni, V.S.  Sorokin, E.M.  Zhukhovitsky.  On the bright work in the period 50-70 years.  little is mentioned - the department simply worked and developed in the directions indicated at the beginning of the article.  However, in the 70s.  The Academy of Sciences of the USSR decided to organize in Perm an academic laboratory on physical hydrodynamics at the Institute of Continuous Media Mechanics, opened in 1971 (IMSS, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c2/1a0/6d9/9c21a06d982a7d529b31335ab8ffe5e1.jpg"><br>  <b>Gershuni G.Z.</b> <br><br>  It is at this time that a new burst of activity occurs.  In 1972, G.Z.  Gershuni and E.M.  Zhukhovitsky publishes in the Nauka Publishing House a monograph ‚ÄúConvective stability of an incompressible fluid‚Äù, currently known to every graduate and student older than the second year of the departments of general and theoretical physics under the simple name ‚Äúgreen book‚Äù.  In 1974, the Ural Conference on the Application of Magnetic Hydrodynamics in Metallurgy was held in Perm; in 1975, the All-Union Conference "Modern Problems of Thermal Convection." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/466/dea/60e/466dea60ed3ccffe9ec3e42df42909ef.jpg"><br>  <b>Lyubimov D.V.</b> <br><br>  Then, in the 70s.  Theses are defended by many future leaders of the direction.  Among them - Dmitry Viktorovich Lyubimov, Honored Scientist of the Russian Federation (one of three at the faculty), who headed the hydrodynamic school and the department of theoretical physics from 1989 to 2012, Nikolai Ivanovich Lobov, Anatoly Alexandrovich Cherepanov, Gennady Fedorovich Putin, now head of the department Physics, Peter Gotlobovich Frick, Head of Physical Fluid Dynamics IAMS, Ural Branch of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and another half or two dozen others.  For many years, the Department of Theoretical Physics occupied the leading positions at PSU in the number of grants, publications, joint projects with foreign organizations.  Unfortunately, the sudden death of the leader, D.V.  Lyubimova noticeably slowed down the work of the department, but he left behind not only more than 250 publications, but also fifty good, if not more, students, candidates and doctors who continue to support and develop the historical direction. <br><br>  <i>The text is based on the book by M.P.</i>  <i>Sorokin, Physics Faculty, Perm State University, 2006</i> <br>  <i>Photos from the site of the PSU, as well as from the personal archive of D.V.</i>  <i>Lyubimova</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/168667/">https://habr.com/ru/post/168667/</a></p>
