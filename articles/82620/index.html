  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Accidental failure or MTS is very cunning pranks?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today I discovered that if you use the services of MTS, the cost of a call from Russia to Myanmar is approximately 70 rubles per minute.  I have no friends, relatives, even acquaintances in Myanmar.  Just by chance (or cleverly planned ‚Äúfailure‚Äù at MTS) such a call took place ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, a brief background.  In early January, my father called me, who uses the services of MTS, and complained that within about an hour about 150 rubles had been withdrawn from him.  He does not send sms to short numbers (in general, he does not send regular sms), calls only by area, so the loss of 150 rubles is more than noticeable to him.  I asked to find out why this money was written off.  I tried to log in to the Internet Helper, as I did earlier, but nothing happened - the system persistently gave an error (the phone number was not found), although everything was set up and registered according to the instructions.  I called the technical support service, said that there is a problem, they are struggling with it, it should work in the coming days ... <br><br>  During the month I tried to log in, but without success ... Yesterday I wrote a letter to the MTS with a question - actually, should I wait for the repair to finish or is it easier to go to the office, order the details there?  Answered that everything works (albeit on a different URL).  Checked - it really works :) Immediately ordered the details in the first days of January. <br><br>  This is the most interesting report fragment: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d9c/65d/d38/d9c65dd3863903fe54e08940a5bcce4d.jpg"><br>  What is highlighted in green is the same number, only in the first 2 lines the prefix is ‚Äã‚Äã0, and in the 3rd line the Russian prefix is ‚Äã‚Äã7, as it should.  The fact is that we often use 8 instead of +7 for dialing federal numbers, and this has always worked.  In this format (8 910 111 22 33), people who are used more to landlines than to mobiles often put phone numbers in the phone‚Äôs address book.  Worked without a glitch ... before the mentioned beginning of January.

      When I told my father today that he had been charged money for a call to Myanmar, he remembered this moment in detail.  This phone number is ‚Äúcrammed‚Äù in his phone book just from 8th instead of +7, and he tried to call him by simply selecting this entry in the contact list.  However, the correct connection was made only from the 3rd time.  Prior to this, the following number was obtained: <br>  095 87 1 ..., i.e.  in the format of an international call to a country with code 95 (Myanmar) <br><br>  Here is such a funny case.  He is not going to challenge this write-off - nerves are more expensive than 140 rubles, but I brought it for myself (and I strongly recommend it) that, to avoid such situations, all numbers should be stored with the prefix +7 <br><br>  <b>UPD: I</b> wrote a letter to the MTS.  They replied that the appeal was submitted to the appropriate department and they will contact me shortly to communicate my decision.  I will keep everyone interested in the course. <br><br>  <b>HAPPY END!</b>  As a result, about a month after my letter, my father was called back from the MTS, apologized and returned the money that was written off (credited to the personal account, in the sense).  Honestly, a very unexpected and positive turn of events :) Thank you, MTS! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/82620/">https://habr.com/ru/post/82620/</a></p>
