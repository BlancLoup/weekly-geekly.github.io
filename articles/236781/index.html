  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Will the entrance through the social media account replace the usual login form?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Logging into the site through an account has always been a problem for most users.  Creating a new account, the user always faces a bunch of obstacles that often become insurmountable.  Should I specify my main mail or use mail for spam, is there a simple password here, or do you need a password that meets specific requirements, like when you next visit to remember which data was specified on this particular site? <br><br>  Often, to solve this problem, a controversial element of the functional of sites is used - entry through social networks.  Somewhere on Habr√© even met something like, ‚ÄúIt infuriates me that website developers are sure that everyone has a Facebook account and sometimes make an entry through social networks the only possible way.‚Äù <br><br>  But let's turn to statistics from foreign Internet (data from <a href="http://janrain.com/">http://janrain.com/</a> ): <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. To begin with, 87% of respondents have an account in social networks.  It is worth remembering that the study was conducted among active Internet users, which almost completely excludes the part of the population that visits the Internet once a week to see the weather. <br>  At the same time, only 18% of owners of pages in social networks do not use the registration form through social.  networks on third-party resources.  As a result, it turns out that 71% of users consider using the account on Facebook and their ilk as a valid way to access the site.

      2. 64% of respondents once or several times left attempts to get to the site due to the fact that they forgot their username or password, and their unwillingness to spend time and energy on their recovery exceeded the need for information they tried to get access to. <br><br>  3. 65% say that they are more willing to return to the site, which provides the ability to enter through the social.  network. <br><br>  4. 67% consider this method of entry to be an excellent way to personalize site content. <br><br>  5. 60% believe that companies using entry through social accounts are more credible, and also look modern and advanced. <br><br>  6. Not all accounts are used with the same zeal: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/415/0c1/b8a/4150c1b8a2044fdeb433c39038e3e577.PNG" alt="image"></div><br><br>  <b>But everything is not so rosy, the <a href="https://blog.mailchimp.com/social-login-buttons-arent-worth-it/">story</a> from MailChimp</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be3/f3d/171/be3f3d1711094f7ca8b8114c96d458bb.png"><br><br>  In 2012, MailChimp specialists determined that about 100,000 users left the resource without filling out the login form, forgetting their username, password, or all at once.  The next solution was to add the ability to use an account on social networks to enter the site.  The result was a decrease in the number of unsuccessful login attempts by 71%, and the frequency of the password recovery procedure decreased by 42%. <br><br>  The experience of MailChimp showed that often, the entrance to the site turns into a guessing game.  The user changes the components of the login / password combination, trying to find the optimal one.  In addition, most users have several options for such combinations, which greatly complicates the process.  Five pairs - these are 25 options that need to be searched, while users use the password recovery feature extremely rarely. <br><br>  But further research showed that only 3.4% of users took advantage of the new opportunity.  In addition, the CEO stated that it seems to him that the new elements are cluttering up the page and now it does not look respectable. <br><br>  <i>The disadvantages of this method of authorization</i> <br><br>  Accounting information, in fact, belongs to a third party.  Who and how can use this information?  What happens if a third party ceases to exist?  Who guarantees the safety of this data?  May dissolve at any time, beyond your control. <br><br>  In addition, there are situations that will significantly reduce the level of confidence in the security of a social network, which will entail the extrapolation of the negative opinion of users on a resource that uses this network to enter. <br><br>  <b>What can you do to make life easier for the user?</b> <br><br>  Returning to the history of MailChimp.  You have already understood that the new features for entering the site did not bring results, in fact, improvements in the policy of error tracking and more informative messages led to improvements.  Instead of a lengthy statement that the user entered incorrect data, the site visitor received accurate information about which part of the credentials was entered incorrectly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/120/219/b25/120219b25754474e897925308e5385ef.png"><br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  Entry through social networks, while not able to replace the usual form of entry or its analogs.  When deciding on the design of the login page, it is important to consider the specifics of your resource.  If the start page of an entertainment or training site may well contain such functionality, then on a resource that has high requirements for data privacy and security, they look absolutely inappropriate. <br><br>  The only area where entry through social networks can dominate almost completely, is the mobile Internet.  Here, the advantages of the functional and the absence of the need to undergo the torturous procedure of entering data from the keyboard gives this method of transferring credentials undeniable advantages. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236781/</a></p>
