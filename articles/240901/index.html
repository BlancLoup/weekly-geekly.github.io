Remember the full name of the Great Combinator?  - Ostap-Suleiman-Berta-Maria-Bender-Bey ... Why is there any kind of "Ilfo Pietra"?  It's just that our regular guest just has such a complex name - Fly IQ4511 Tornado One Octa.  For greater solidity, you can still add "Black" ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  IQ4511 - the first model in the new premium line Tornado.  As far as the filling of the smartphone corresponds to the name "flagship" - in the descriptions of the device you can often see such an epithet - we will discuss below.  In the meantime, let's talk about the appearance of the smartphone. <br><br>  You can laugh at the premium prefix for a long time, but the Tornado One really looks good.  The screen is covered with Gorilla Glass 3, and the back fixed panel with Dragontrail glass - they say that the brainchild of Asahi Glass Co.  (one of the key divisions of Mitsibishi) can withstand even greater loads than material from the American company Corning.  However, the Vickers method says that Dragontrail is still somewhat inferior to the third version of GG - indicators 595-673 and 622-701, respectively.

It is believed that it is easier to hold a smartphone in your hand - in our opinion, this is rather a design move that makes a few body elegant.  Yes, and the similarity with the form factor of ‚Äújust parallelepiped‚Äù due to this solution is also reduced. <br><br>  At the top there is a microUSB and a 3.5 mm audio jack, at the bottom there is only a speaker grille.  Today, the connectors are trying to dissolve at different ends, but this does not cause any particular inconvenience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/24a/411/fd7/24a411fd7165417a985e2a8e233b8a87.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3fc/cfa/604/3fccfa604ccb41dbbe207296bffa768a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70d/8d5/3c8/70d8d53c8ec942a1b1de72ea7753aa8f.png"><br><br>  On the left - a slot for SIM cards (dual tray can be removed using a complete pin or any other sharp object), and on the right ... Because of a non-standard solution, a microSD slot was placed on top - the power button and volume control went down, which knocks down a bit sense, especially in the first days of using a smartphone.  Keep in mind. <br><br>  As for the build quality, we didn‚Äôt find any squeaks, cracks and other disgraces.  In the hand, IQ4511 sits better than <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/gttf/blog/240267/">ASUS ZenFone 5</a> - Tornado One is almost a centimeter shorter than the Taiwanese "five" in height. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/833/451/2bf/8334512bfb814419ae0b2c5d3fb93f12.png"><br><br>  Kohl we remembered ASUS - the Tornado One screen reminded us of the quality of the ZenFone 5 matrix. The IPS matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãgood, but, for example, when viewed from the bottom and to the right, the display takes on a blue tint.  But the brightness is much higher than that of the five-inch ZenFone. <br><br>  The system touch buttons here are only indicated by dots - and their lights go out quickly and without a certain dexterity you can easily miss. <br><br>  On clothes meet - see off the mind.  The eight-core MT6592M from MediaTek, along with the Mali-450 MP4 video processor, do an excellent job with the load - they checked with benchmarks and games.  Yes, the RAM here is only 1 gigabyte - it does not affect the performance of everyday tasks.  But purely psychologically - the sediment still remains.  After all, her, darling, does not happen much. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b8a/bec/033/b8abec033e3347d798cd6f1a8b771352.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd8/9ec/a2f/dd89eca2f710465ca433a63d5e8e3db8.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7dd/8f0/d37/7dd8f0d373c144a5a8c6b5516d72008e.png"><br><br>  By the way, the MT6592 processor has as many as three modifications - ‚ÄúM‚Äù, ‚ÄúT‚Äù and just ‚Äú6592‚Äù.  It uses the youngest processor model - "M".  There is no need to be particularly worried about this - as the <a href="http://86digi.com/3793.html">Chinese geeks</a> proved in May - you will notice the difference between them only armed with AnTuTu everyone there. <br><br>  Tornado One meets us almost untouched by Android 4.4.2.  Something to surprise sophisticated users will not work (it is unlikely that it is possible due to the pre-installed applications of mobile banks, social networks or taxi services).  The only thing that can be noted is the ability to control the smartphone with gestures.  By default, three are set - double tap, up and down on the screen (go to the lock screen, home screen and in the application for calls, respectively).  But there is an opportunity to ask 5 more gestures - any application can be hung on them (imitation of letters - ‚Äúc‚Äù, ‚Äúw‚Äù, etc.).  Such a chip could be called irreplaceable if it were not for the duplication of your gesture with animation - from the gesture itself to the transition to the desired function, it takes about three seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b45/b87/150/b45b87150cb94edd888ce343861264a8.png"><br><br>  What we could not find fault with was the camera.  The photo-video interface is simple and unpretentious: if you hold the smartphone horizontally, then to the left - switching the main modes - a live photo, motion tracking, a beautiful face, a panorama and a polygonal view - with this you will play enough in the first two days.  Above is any useful small things like activating the camera with a ‚ÄúVictoria‚Äù gesture, including HDR mode and flash games.  Under the "gear" - everything else for those who do not want to put up with the presence of an automatic shooting mode.  It seems to be a lot of things, but I remembered a simple and convenient tracking function: clicked, held ‚Äî that's all, now the selected object will be constantly in focus. <br><br>  You ask: what about quality?  We answer: no surprises.  All within the capabilities of the Sony Exmor RS 13-megapixel matrix. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c9d/8b0/45a/c9d8b045a7584005a042cb836e95b815.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f2/4ab/635/8f24ab63589f4666b63aa8e60ec31a00.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7f/8ac/e62/b7f8ace62618444fa097f1f995a23831.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d3/6ef/765/1d36ef7654f842889f375a534a311e0a.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d33/cf4/cc4/d33cf4cc4bde40a08379acddf61631bb.png"><br><br>  Sound.  Score - "satisfactory."  You can listen to music, perhaps, only through headphones;  the speaker is loud but mediocre, and the voice one often gives noticeable distortion. <br><br>  We have two last items left - the possibility of working with two SIM-cards and a battery.  Alas, but for the first you have to pay the second.  Price of convenience - a day of work with minimal use.  Yes, and a good screen also greatly affects the autonomous operation time - the battery capacity of 1920 mAh is clearly not enough. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f4d/a29/af7/f4da29af7c5b4e35907b82827c358fb4.png"><br><br>  Yes, in order to avoid confusion - on the Internet you can find information about two radio modules - it is still one here.  Well, it is worth recalling that support for 4G / LTE networks is missing here. <br><br>  To summarize  Well, Fly, using real examples, proves that it can do beautiful and stylish things.  And for a reasonable price.  Another thing is that the epithet "premium" has long been turned into a marketing stamp that is used wherever it hits.  And, of course, it is not applicable to smartphones in this price category.  Despite the use of GG3 and Dragontrail. <br><br>  As for the "flagship".  Here, in defense of the Tornado One, we can say one thing: among other smartphones of the Fly company, the IQ4511 model really has the best performance (infa - 100%).  And for many fans of the brand this will really be enough. <br><br>  Among the obvious drawbacks of the new Tornado One smartphone - a weak battery - you will have to have a charger or an external extra battery ready.  And the minimum for the present times the amount of RAM.  Point. <br><br>  PS Tornado One in motion can be seen on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dv1batobnqGA">our YouTube channel</a> ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240901/</a></p>
