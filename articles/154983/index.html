For my, so far, short life, I changed about 5-7 phones and worked in the repair center.  I will say one thing, the Nokia E70 was a masterpiece.  Not counting the joystick.  I broke it, I had to periodically glue and fix it to work normally.  For a year and a half, I was with him, after which I decided to switch to something new and bought my first touchscreen phone in my life: Gigabyte GSmart i128.  Then I realized what everyone is going and how terrible it is. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Hello, my name is Alex, I'm 20 years old, I hate touch phones. <br><br>  For me, the phone is not a means of entertainment, but I need good applications to perform certain functions.  The very first phone that suited this business in the second half of the zero, and it also suited me on a budget, was the Nokia 3230. Then I realized that I needed smartphones.  After it, I bought the E70, and it was the greatest phone I still miss, even though it wouldn‚Äôt perform its functions so well now.  There was nothing super cool about it, except for a screen with a relatively high screen resolution of 352 x 416 pixels at that time, and, most importantly, a full-fledged qwerty keyboard. <br><br>  In those years I was still a schoolboy, many asked to show what a miracle it was.  In the normal state, he was not remarkable, but it was enough to decompose him, as he turned into an eared monster, the input speed of which was awesome.  No touch phone can even compare.

      As I said, I went with him for a long time and decided to try something new, leave the Simba and try a Windows Mobile.  But, firstly, the Gigabyte GSmart i128 itself was pretty awful, and secondly, I was terribly disliked by the system's buggyness.  I put several versions of Windows, but it did not save the impression.  The most terrible was the text input.  Especially without a stylus.  The screen was ‚Äúpressed‚Äù into the phone, and the sides on the side interfered with pressing the extreme buttons.  Then the sensor from below began to act up and I quickly poured it, changing the dialer to a regular Nokia phone. <br><br>  The dialer was good, nothing superfluous.  But there were not many applications to manage the server / computer from the phone, normal maps.  In general, there was nothing, it is a dialer, which is still required of her. <br><br>  Then I bought a Nokia E63, and this is my second favorite phone after the E70.  <s>The same eggs, only in profile.</s>  The input speed on it, if not strange, was lower than on the E70, but still good.  Everything was fine until I read about the Google phones, made a website for them, went to watch the first htc hero appear in Russia and waited for my decision to go. <br><br>  Released inexpensive compared to htc, LG Optimus One, which I took.  And which I still have.  I used many sensory, but they are all about the same sensitivity.  Only the larger the screen, the easier it is to hit the keys. <br><br>  I will not say anything bad about an android, I love this axis and I will only use it for a long time.  This is about the sensor.  Everything remained at the level of that Korean gigabyte.  You will say that many new possibilities arise with the sensor, and you will be right.  A lot of functions are very easy to perform on the sensor.  But do not print the text.  Over the past two years, I correspond only with urgent need.  And then, I have a keyboard like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7f7/d6d/af4/7f7d6daf457f7ef74568ebf5e0424f0d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I don't know what's the matter.  I am a musician, I hit the buttons and strings, but not the sensory sectors.  I do not understand why in the last year not a single Google phone with a qwerty keyboard was announced.  Already in the Blackberry series, sensory sensors appear, although the phones there are needed for calls and correspondence, in my opinion. <br><br>  Why did I write this post?  I want to buy a new google phone, but there is nothing with qwerty keyboard and normal firmware.  Now you‚Äôll start offering dvuhsimochnye samsungi with a terribly inhibitory system for 6 kilorubles and already outdated soapers in the form of soap, yes.  But where are the normal push-button smartphones?  Where are they? <br><br><h4>  Instead of output </h4><br>  I really may not know about some good phones with a normal keyboard, I did not hold new motor cars in my hands, for example.  If there are any, tell me.  I really hope that in the future we are waiting for the hybridization of hardware and sensory clavs.  To the phone bulged and pressed elements like ordinary buttons.  But so far I have never heard of such a thing, except for the old prototypes of the Nokia, which has long since died, but still makes me admire it, looking at some of the masterpieces of telephone engineering. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/154983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/154983/</a></p>
