Now, according to the company, a child seat or booster will be in every other car on the line - just 10,000 cars.  According to representatives of the service, innovation will increase the share of orders for travel with young children up to 5-7% in the Moscow market. <br><br>  In September, Yandex.Taxi in Moscow had 35,000 ‚Äúchildren's‚Äù orders, which is about 2% of all service orders.  ‚ÄúHowever, we see a much greater potential demand,‚Äù said service leader Tigran Khudaverdian. <br><br>  Yandex.Taxi also introduced additional requirements for cars with child seats.  In addition, Yandex.Taxi announced a reduction in surcharges for a child seat from 150 to 100 rubles.  In Gett, for example, this amount is 200 rubles. <a name="habracut"></a>

      ‚ÄúBaby‚Äù orders will be received only by drivers with a high rating, and the quality control service will check the serviceability and cleanliness of the seats, Vedomosti reports. <br><br>  In early October, Yandex.Taxi announced the launch of a special program for fleet employees: they will be able to use the corporate tariff for cellular communications and the Internet from one of the telecom operators.  The competitors, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">Uber</a> and <a href="http://gett.com/ru">Gett</a> , also have different systems for motivating and encouraging drivers. <br><br>  According to the Moscow Department of Transport, there are about 55,000 taxi drivers with licenses in the capital, many work together with several taxi aggregators.  120 000-250 000 taxis are ordered per day, more than half are calls via Uber, Gett and Yandex.Taxi applications. <br><br>  October 27, "Yandex.Taxi" earned in Novosibirsk, <a href="http://news.ngs.ru/more/2292013/">transfer</a> NGS.NOVOSTI.  As the regional representative of ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù Olga Molodan informed, Novosibirsk became the first city of Siberia in which the service was launched. <br><br>  Now, about 150 Grand Taxi cars and the RNIC (Regional Navigation and Information Center of the Novosibirsk Region) are working through the service.  They operate at ‚ÄúEconomy‚Äù tariffs (boarding - 79 rubles, 16 rubles / km), Comfort (195 rubles for the first 2 km, then 17 rubles / km) and Business (395 rubles for the first 2 km, then 25 rubles / km). <br><br>  In addition to Novosibirsk, the service operates in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg, Sochi and a number of other cities.  In total, more than 35 thousand cars are connected to it from more than 450 taxi stations and control rooms. <br><br>  From October 27, Uber taxi service also began work in Novosibirsk - it became the fifth city in Russia in which the company operates.  At the time of launch, only the ‚Äúbudget‚Äù option of UberX transportation is available in the new region.  The cost of a trip to UberX in Novosibirsk is 59 rubles per landing plus four rubles per minute and four rubles per kilometer.  Similar tariffs apply in Kazan, where Uber launched in September 2015. <br><br>  A competing Gett taxi service also operates in Novosibirsk.  This service in Russia is the main competitor of Yandex.Taxi.  Uber activity in our country is not so strong. <br><br>  Megamind <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/20010/">wrote</a> that the Gett internet taxi service was launched in five more million-plus Russian cities.  On October 7, the service appeared in Rostov-on-Don, Samara, Krasnoyarsk, as well as in Sochi and Yekaterinburg. <br><br>  The average bill for taxi services in Krasnoyarsk and Rostov-on-Don is about 200 rubles, in Sochi and Yekaterinburg - 220-240 rubles, in Samara - about 180 rubles.  According to analysts Gett, in Sochi, the annual turnover of the taxi market is about 20 billion rubles, in Rostov-on-Don - 6 billion rubles.  Samara and Krasnoyarsk each account for 5 billion rubles, while Yekaterinburg accounts for about 4 billion rubles. <br><br>  In addition to the cities listed above, the service operates in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Nizhny Novgorod.  Gett estimates the entire Russian taxi transportation market at $ 9 billion (572 billion rubles at the Central Bank exchange rate). <br><br>  Megamind requested a comment from Gett representatives: <br><blockquote>  The Gett team is closely following the feedback and wishes of its users.  The decision to launch a separate class of cars with child seats - "Children's" - was made on the basis of these wishes.  The class was launched at the end of April 2015.  Prior to this, users had to spend time commenting on the order, asking them to send a car equipped with a booster chair, or to check the availability of such cars from dispatchers.  The cost of supplying a car with a booster chair is an additional 200 rubles.  Thus, the cost is 50 rubles for the supply, 18 rubles per minute and 200 rubles for the booster chair in the comfort class. <br><br>  About cities.  In the summer of 2015, Gett announced the start of a regional expansion - the company plans to launch its service in all million-plus cities of Russia.  Initially, the service only worked in Moscow, in October 2012 it appeared in St. Petersburg and did not expand its presence until the summer of 2015.  From the end of June, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk (where only Yandex and Uber came out today) were launched, and from October 7, Gett expanded its work area to 5 more cities - Sochi, Rostov-on-Don, Samara, Yekaterinburg and Krasnoyarsk. <br><br>  Now we are preparing for the launch of new cities, the company assesses the prospects of the markets and their potential.  But we will be able to talk in more detail about the dates and specific regions only closer to the moment. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295748/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295748/</a></p>
