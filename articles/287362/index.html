  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Blog Review # 22</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/175689.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/175689.html</a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The month of May, in addition to celebrating my birthday, will be remembered by the world for the deep informational vacuum that blog fans across the planet have been pleased with.  After all, the best newspaper of our time has temporarily suspended the publication of Blog Reviews.  We will not talk about the causes of this phenomenon.  Perhaps it was a large-scale magnetic anomaly.  Probably, agents of unfriendly publications tried.  Most likely, the author got the power supply or he was just lazy.  Nevertheless, the reviews are again on the pages of ‚ÄúKV‚Äù and they smell wonderful with printing ink.  We continue! <br><br>  Roman Stepanov maintains a <a href="http://livemarketing.ru/">livemarketing</a> blog <a href="http://livemarketing.ru/">- a marketing blog</a> .  Surprisingly, this blog is dedicated to marketing and finance.  The fact that Roman understands what he is writing about is his biography - a couple of years headed sales &amp; marketing in one of the successful regional Internet portals, and now lives in Moscow and is engaged in marketing in a rather large international telecom company that includes in France Telecom Group.  The blog will soon be one year old, and I want to hope that it will remain as informative and regularly updated.

      Remember, the little English girl Alice was amused with a pie and some kind of liquid, on which were the inscriptions ‚ÄúEat me‚Äù and ‚ÄúDrink me‚Äù?  I do not promise you the same transformations after visiting the blog " <a href="http://sellme.ru/">Sell ‚Äã‚Äãme</a> " (Sell me), but he will make you think for sure.  It is led by another star figure in the Russian blogosphere - Dmitry Chestnykh (speaking last name, yeah).  This blog, like the previous one, is about business and marketing.  At least his statement speaks in favor of the author, that he never worked anywhere.  I do not urge readers to quit working, but simply to prove that Dmitry is probably a little versed in business.  If not lying, of course.  In any case, reading his blog is just interesting.  In addition, Dmitry is the author of the popular blog client <a href="http://blogjet.com/">BlogJet</a> . <br><br>  I crawl over blogs and a fat amoeba on blogs and leave a part of each of them on my body.  Agree, this is better than if I left a piece of myself on the blog.  Cleaning myself before the radio day celebration, I discovered the entertaining blog <a href="http://setti.biz/">setti.biz</a> .  In the "Author" section, anything is written, except for the name and surname of the author himself.  Such secrecy is alarming, so I already told this blog where it should and where it should not (for example, at the vegetable depot No. 6).  Nevertheless, the blog content is constantly updated with new notes on the creation and support of blogs, as well as reviews of Internet services.  I wish the author to tear off the mask of mystery!  Or for him it will make "who follows." <br><br>  The blog with the name " <a href="http://theweblog.net/">Digital Life</a> " is about her, dear, and tells.  The author is also hiding from the public, but, unlike the previous hero, does not even disclose the place of birth.  But regularly publishes interesting notes about life in the world wide web.  By the way, the author even wrote the book ‚ÄúBlogs and RSS ...‚Äù, thanks to which I nevertheless learned that Vitaly Gerasevich was leading the blog.  The book, it turns out, and we have sold.  No, Vitaly did not pay me for advertising, but I was interested in his blog in such a cunning way.  What I slybryuga, however. <br><br>  Where people just do not wander in search of usability.  Especially in order for them to go somewhere, the resourceful Andrei Sedelnikov created a blog with the same name - ‚Äú <a href="http://usabilist.de/seeking/ru">In search of usability</a> ‚Äù.  As you understand, the blog is dedicated to usability problems and their possible solutions.  In my opinion, Andrei writes interesting notes, and although I personally think usability is not the most important global problem (trafficking in our women is what should be written and what to fight against!), I constantly read new records. <br><br>  And the latest in our review today is a nimble <a href="http://web-blog.ru/">blog about Internet marketing</a> from a notable marketer Andrei Muravyov (Andrei is only twenty years old, so you are sometimes rather skeptical about his notes).  In his blog, Andrew addresses issues of search engine optimization, contextual advertising, copywriting and even usability.  And sometimes not only affects, but also touches the full!  I pay your attention to this blog because it is informative and regularly updated. <br><br>  <b>Lesha Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006200603.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ20, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287362/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287362/</a></p>
