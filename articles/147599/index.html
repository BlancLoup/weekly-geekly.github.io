Critics believe the authorities will use the new rules to block any unwanted sites. <br>  ... <br>  In the first edition of the law allowed to stop the work of any sites "containing harmful information for children."  However, by the third reading this vague wording was replaced with more specific ones.  The state will be entitled without a court decision to block sites for posting pornography involving minors, for promoting drugs and information about the methods of committing suicide. <br><br>  At the same time, amendments to the draft law were made late Tuesday evening in order to be in time for voting.  The amendments were discussed by committee members via email;  full meeting was not held. <br></blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/147599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/147599/</a></p>
