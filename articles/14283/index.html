  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Air sellers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I thought about this a long time ago, but I was pushed into writing articles by fresh events from the life of ‚Äúour‚Äù search engine <a href="http://subscribe.ru/archive/inet.search.seo/200709/04194552.html/">‚ÄúCHANGES IN THE LANGUAGE OF YANDEX REQUESTS ...‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  So about everything in order. <br>  In my opinion, search engines are by their nature non-commercial projects - they are designed to help users navigate the Internet.  But their successful commercialization leads to the emergence of internal contradictions.  And their growth and weight on the Internet to the growth of the influence of their internal contradictions on the entire network. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I will try to explain with an example: <br>  Village, lake, factory.  The factory makes toothbrushes selling them, and distributes them to villagers for free.  The whole village enjoys and enjoys healthy teeth.  But the factory wastes waste into the lake, everything died there and there was nothing to chew on with healthy teeth.  Is it better with the advent of the factory?

      They learned how to deal with such a situation in ordinary life - close the factory, punish the director, restore the lake for 20 years.  Now let's deal with the ecology of the Internet and the technology of search engines (I will focus on Yandex). <br><br>  Yandex has a small well-visited page (let's accept A4 format).  At the same time, due to good attendance, this page has a huge advertising potential.  But Yandex sells advertising only from a small rectangle of paid advertising (4x6 cm in size) on the right side above the middle.  The ratio of the advertising capacity of the main part of the issue and the paid part will be approximately 10: 1 (expert estimates may vary, but in my opinion the order is approximately the same).  Those.  for every million dollars earned by Yandex, there are potential $ 10 million earned by optimizers of all stripes serving the top ten for popular requests.  This leads to the fact that the number of optimizers increases at a high rate.  And the qualification of the best part of optimizers is not inferior to the qualifications of Yandex employees, and the number of optimizers (given the nature of the distribution of money in Yandex and optimizers) will always be two to three orders of magnitude higher than the number of Yandex employees.  And in these conditions, competition is taking place - Yandex wants to keep the right relevant (from the users' point of view) main issue and make money on paid advertising.  Optimizers want to sharpen the main issue for their advertising tasks.  Yandex sets the rules for the game itself, but they are quickly learned and the main sample becomes an advertising platform.  Changing the rules of the game gives Yandex a small gain in time, but as you can see now does not change the situation in recent years - the quality of the main issue falls and the first page works simply as an optimizer advertising space.  In my opinion, mathematics cannot be deceived - Yandex simply has no chance to win (just the mathematical model does not allow) - there is a chance to earn good money for some time, but at what price? <br>  Consider the rules of the game - technology, so to speak, production.  It is not a secret for anybody that the basis is the reference ranking and its modifications and variations.  This technology greatly affects the state of the Internet as a whole - that is, the bulk of the content that is created and consumed by users.  We study the chronology of events.  First there were large letters, then the same words with small text, then linkbomoyki and message boards with automatic filling with garbage, then cloning sites with the same content and sharpened under one request, then links from fat mugs and now the top of development - links from individual articles from similar resources subjects.  Those.  having ridded the Internet with link-washers, doorways, cloned sites, they have now made a breeding ground for filling the Internet with articles without meaning mutually referring to each other.  Apparently the next round will be email.  Yandex brain that will try to separate articles with meaning from "just sets of words on the topic."  Thus, by creating a breeding ground for bogging the entire Internet, Yandex is in torment trying to clean the thin stream and provide it to the user (apparently, the user should be very grateful for this free service).  For some reason this reminds me of an air trading strategy - poisoning everything around and selling clean air in bottles. <br><br>  Google works in a similar way, only the size of the swamp is larger. <br><br>  I want to emphasize - nothing personal!  I am not against these companies, but I believe that the model itself is incorrect! <br><br>  PS shutdown of operators, which was described in the article by reference, in my opinion, not so much to complicate the work of optimizers, but in order to avoid the commercial formation of the results of the main issue. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/14283/">https://habr.com/ru/post/14283/</a></p>
