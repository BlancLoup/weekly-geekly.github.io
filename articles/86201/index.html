  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Browsers - Cars</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Until March 17, Microsoft, in accordance with the directive of the European Commission, should have offered Windows users in the EU countries a special browser selection window (and <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do%3Freference%3DIP/10/216%26format%3DHTML%26aged%3D0%26language%3DEN%26guiLanguage%3Den">proposed</a> ).  So it looks like - <a href="http://www.browserchoice.eu/">www.browserchoice.eu</a> .  For us, unlike the EU, this event looks more curious than practically useful.  I want to coincide with the post ‚ÄúWhat would happen if browsers were cars‚Äù, in which the pros and cons of the top five browsers beat the descriptions of each of them in the ‚Äúselection screen‚Äù - it is for these descriptions that EU users will now choose than going to the Internet.  Of course every sandpiper praises its swamp.  But for the 1000th time, it‚Äôs boring to talk about the advantages and disadvantages "head on" :) <br><br>  <b>So, what if browsers would be cars</b> ?  (Where did you lie, what did you fail to say, who is right, who is to blame?).  Who better suspension, who does not lead on the road, whose wheel better not sit? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Mozilla firefox </h2><br>  According to market analysts, today Firefox is the most popular machine in the world.  It is economical, relatively safe and has good speed characteristics.  However, all these advantages are peculiar only to the basic configuration of Firefox. <br><br>  Unfortunately, it only includes the chassis, body, engine and wheels.  The steering wheel, seats, wind, front and side windows, as well as headlights and gearbox must be purchased separately - all this comes in the form of extensions.  If you need them, choose them carefully: some parts may not be compatible with different basic versions of the car. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      It should be borne in mind that after installing the extensions, Firefox will become more comfortable and spectacular, but it will add significantly in weight, which means you can forget about economy and speed.  80% of Firefox users use the basic version without extensions. <br><br><h2>  Microsoft Internet Explorer </h2><br>  This car just until recently was the most popular.  Why did he surrender to Firefox?  Because it is difficult and unsafe to drive a two-wheeled car with an engine in the cabin, seats on the roof and a wheel from the bike.  Especially without a seat belt.  Especially for older people.  However, they remain the main users of the IE car.  Just because they do not know about alternatives. <br><br>  Some IE drivers fainted when they learned that there were 4-wheel alternative cars in the world with comfortable salons and powerful engines, with a more friendly round steering wheel.  Despite the continuous improvement of the system of protection against hacking, IE remains the most hijacked car according to traffic police statistics.  Today, most of these cars are sold as part of social packages for corporate employees who cannot change them for anything else. <br><br>  A few months ago, the manufacturer publicly announced the release of a new, perfect and unique car - now with three wheels.  In addition, thanks to the leak, it became known that in future versions of IE, the bicycle handlebar may be replaced by a helicopter arm! <br><br><h2>  Apple safari </h2><br>  Comfortable car with a beautiful design, high-speed performance and opportunities for driving over rough terrain.  In order to experience the benefits of this car, you also need a home, a garage, clothes and pets from the same manufacturer.  Well, if you are a perfectionist and want to get the best result, you will have to move to the Apple zone. <br><br>  This is a region with an administrative center in Cupertino, with streets and avenues, parking lots and traffic lights specially designed for the needs of residents, which are significantly different from those that are accepted in the rest of the world and are more convenient. <br><br>  Also keep in mind: if you decide to repaint your Safari-car to a new color without permission from the authorities of Apple zone, tune in to a radio station broadcasting from a neighboring area, or put on unapproved bus administration, you will have to pay a substantial fine and possibly leave the zone. <br><br><h2>  Google chrome </h2><br>  Today, Chrome, the newcomer to the auto industry, is one of the fastest cars in the world.  It‚Äôs like a race car, but with minimal control options and gauges.  In particular, there is no speedometer on the driver's panel, so the speed is determined by whistling in the ears. <br><br>  Chrome cars are famous for their starting speed: from 0 to 100 km / h the car accelerates in record time, thanks to a 20-liter engine, similar to the engine in Safari, but substantially reworked.  Such an approach can be called traditional for the American automobile industry.  Therefore, Chrome is chosen by those who do not care about economic issues: this car is also a record holder in gluttony (attention! Refuels only with branded gasoline!). <br><br>  The best effect of Chrome can be felt on perfectly smooth highways, specially designed for this car - on the rest of the roads, numerous speedy chisels and chips up to 2 millimeters in the way interfere with high-speed traffic.  Apparently, therefore, the manufacturer is increasingly thinking about the establishment of the Google zone, somewhere near the Apple zone. <br><br><h2>  Opera </h2><br>  The only representative of the European auto business in the top five largest automakers. <br><br>  The latest version of Auto Opera is declared as the fastest on the market, and indeed in most tests it is ahead of even Google Chrome race cars. <br><br>  However, builders of highways, intersections, bridges and tunnels sometimes experience problems with the compatibility of Opera cars - periodically their dimensions go beyond the pavement (however, the manufacturer himself declares that he manufactures his cars according to all auto standards). <br><br>  Opera machines are supplied only in the maximum configuration.  Even the basic model is equipped with heated seats, power accessories, GPS-navigator, barbecue, a small fridge with Norwegian beer in the trunk and salty crackers in the glove compartment. <br><br>  However, you will not be able to independently purchase additional options, such as a jacuzzi with built-in girls or billiards.  You need to send a wish to the manufacturer and expect a result.  Perhaps the manufacturer sells what you need in the next versions of the car and maybe not. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86201/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86201/</a></p>
