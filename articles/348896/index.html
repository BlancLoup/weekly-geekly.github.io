  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cradle: Rave. Two hackathons + conference, with emphasis on Big Data & ML, Blockchain, Quantum Computing, DevOps and Mobile</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  Last week, friends called to relax on a certain <a href="http://sber-tech.com/cradle-rave/">Cradle: Rave</a> .  Judging by the name, it could be anything, including an acid party, so I decided to do some research on the Internet. </p><br><p>  On Habr√© quickly found <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sberbank/blog/348554/">an article in the blog Sberteha</a> with the announcement of the event.  This was not enough for me, so I contacted the organizers directly and asked in my own words to explain what it was.  The information provided was even wider than it is now published on the site, and now I will share with you these open secret secrets. </p><br><p>  It turned out pretty cool.  This is a hybrid entertainment that combines a hackathon and a conference.  They took two main ways of cultural pastime, packed in three days, worried about the room and nishtyak.  Cool.  It will be this week, February 16-18. </p><br><p>  <b>Free</b> , in other words - for free, on the ball, completely free.  But you need to have time to register before the 15th on the site, registration is required. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f40/93c/559/f4093c5596645a924a0446aa25d0affa.png"><br></p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Hackathons </h1><br><p>  They are thematic: big data / machine learning and mobile development.  Mobile development is not simple: it is highly desirable to use VR, ML, AR, Blockchain, biometrics.  For example, I do not understand anything of this from the word at all, so I am going to google Tensorflow, and how it can be run from Java.  Sbertech promises to bring his mentors on all the above technologies, i.e.  For me, this is an opportunity not just to google, but also to test the knowledge gained with real experts. </p><br><p>  Considering that bigdat is, most likely, Hadoop / Spark, and mobile phones are Android, I expect that all this will look like a kind of special java-hackathon.  Although nowhere in the descriptions, I saw no restrictions on the technologies used.  You can and Python.  Unless they want the algorithms used to be formally described on block diagrams (gives extra points) - this is strange, but ... ok, let it be. </p><br><p>  The program and timing of hackathons are standard: on Friday you need to note that you are, on Sunday - to pass the project.  And take the money if you earned something.  But there is something interesting!  Skolkovo does not work at night, so the organizers took an unprecedented step: it‚Äôs not necessary to be on the court at all.  How long I waited for someone to guess before that!  Introverts (like me) sometimes need to disconnect from communication with people.  IMHO, this is the definition of an introvert - a person who can not fully relax, talking to people.  Moreover, I will lie down for three days on an airplane and spend the night with friends, and someone nearby has a cozy warm office with its own atmosphere, and it‚Äôs not rational to hang around Skolkovo all the time.  All this need to sit around the clock on the court fiercely strained me at other similar events - and here, thanks to the chaos and anarchy, this will not happen. </p><br><p>  Separately, I received an informal assurance from the corporate communications department that all rights to the developed software will remain with the developers.  This is good and fair.  (Now the hakathon organizers (we will not poke fingers) have acquired a disgusting habit of forcing them to fill in a pack of papers, on which you are obliged to transfer to them not only the source code, but also the soul. We must fight this and in every possible way make it clear that we are not going to participate in this .) That is, roughly speaking, you can not do random random stuff, but a real side project, or even solve work issues. </p><br><p>  A separate question - how to find a team.  If you, the reader, are as <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">Hikkan</a> as I am, it is not trivial.  How do you even imagine it: approach a random person on the street and suggest: "girl, let's pokakatonymsya"?  You can try to use for this comment Habr: you need to write right now in the comments that you want to participate.  Right now - because then you forget. </p><br><h1>  The conference </h1><br><p>  The general outline of the conference is as follows: blockchain, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, Internet of things, distributed storage, devops. </p><br><p>  She has a program, and she is now vividly forming.  Therefore <a href="http://sber-tech.com/cradle-rave/">, there are still gaps</a> on the web page with the program. </p><br><p>  Obviously, Sbertech will lead there many of his experts.  About DevOps will tell the head of the testers, about quanta - the head of the relevant direction, about IoT - the director of the billing systems development center.  I have one specific plan for all these people - to catch them on the sidelines and ask a number of burning questions. </p><br><p>  But besides this there will be also external specialists.  There will definitely be comrades from IBM, who will tell about QISKit, Watson and IoT. </p><br><p>  Perhaps even I myself can squeeze in with a talk on the present and future of Java.  The motivation is simple: half of the software, which is discussed at the conference, works on the JVM.  There was very little time for preparation, and I can only tell what I know "without preparation."  For example, what happened in Java 9, the release plan, and the composition of JEPs for Java 10 and 11. But all this has been written on the water. </p><br><p>  The highlight of the program is the ‚Äúpecha-heap‚Äù on the blockchain.  This word sounds a little wild, so I had to <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B5%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0-%25D0%25BA%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25B0">uncover Wikipedia</a> : </p><br><blockquote>  Methodology for presenting short reports, specially limited in form and duration, at informal PechaKucha Nights conferences.  The speaker presents a presentation of 20 slides, each slide is shown for 20 seconds, after which it automatically changes to the next.  Thus, the duration of the report is limited to 6 minutes 40 seconds or 6 minutes.  Reports follow one another.  The number of reports usually varies from 8 to 12. After each presentation, a break is taken at drink &amp; talk to exchange ideas. </blockquote><p>  I have no idea if they can handle such a hard format on Cradle: Rave, but if it works out it will be cool.  In reality, judging by the program, this is a kind of a single block of reports on the blockchain, occupying two standard timeslots.  The plan is the same - catch all these people one by one and ask questions.  Now there is a huge HYIP around the blockchain, but there are quite a few people who can intelligently explain how to use it and get profit from it. </p><br><h1>  findings </h1><br><p>  February 16-18, there will be an interesting hybrid event (hackathons + conference) dedicated to blockchain, bigdate, quanta, and other fresh things. </p><br><p>  All this is not very much promoted on the Web, but it seems that it may well come out well and interesting. </p><br><p>  I recommend to go and take a look with one eye, but for real Jedi - sign up for a hackathon. </p></div>
