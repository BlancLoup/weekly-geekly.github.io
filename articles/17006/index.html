  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Motivation through the eyes of a web developer.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have long puzzled over what would such a stick in the blog, to filter out a modest share of omnipotent "karma".  And came across a pressing topic - the motivation of my beloved. <br><br>  I look at this question solely from my own opinion, and I am sure that you, the readers, will criticize and supplement, but we will not be cunning, because we like to do just that. <br><br>  And so, what could be easier?  You need to answer yourself the questions: <br><ol><li>  Why do I sometimes just sick of the thought of work? </li><li>  And why do I like to do this? </li></ol>  Since we are talking about motivation, then all the natural factors, such as: bad weather, had a row (quarreled) with a girl (boyfriend), cut a mudila on a boomer, swept aside. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  1. ZP </h2><br>  I think everyone will agree that the basis of "work" laid "green monolith."  Well, essno, the “press” is thicker, the more desire.  Here it is - the power that controls our consciousness, and her name is USD (for gourmets EUR, GPB or JPY). <br>  But not everything is so transparent, I think many of us encountered the situation that the omnipotent uncle dollar did not give the desired effect.  It would seem that the solution is obvious - we increase the dose!  But no, but I will not repeat the joke - “ZP as a drug”, but simply agree that the effect is present. <br>  Then what else?

    <h2>  2. Difficult, uncommon project. </h2><br>  We used to hear: "We are working on an interesting project."  And we hear so often that the second question in the interview is “What kind of project?”, And often the answer to this question has a strong influence on the final choice.  But what is this amorphous "Interesting"?  Project ala "almost like facebook, but better"? <br>  For me, interesting is: <br><blockquote>  1. The use of new techniques and feints. </blockquote><br>  We are implementing support for back-forward buttons for Ajax ... Oh, this is interesting!  We transfer the Controller layer completely to the client-side, and the server-side is left purely as a DB-Layer, “Wow, yes, it’s not your end!”.  But if you think about how often such things happen in “interesting” projects? <br><blockquote>  2. Architecture of the project. </blockquote><br>  Here I would take the analytical part of the project.  Quite interesting and informative, to see how a large whole is broken into many pieces, how the threads of relations between them line up, how the scheme of the brainchild gradually emerges, on which all vital and not very visible organs are visible.  All this is good, but it is not often, and not always beautiful, but in most of the “interesting” ones there is something that pleases. <br>  But an interesting project will not be full.  Practice shows that these 2 factors are sometimes not enough. <br>  What else spoils our life? <br><br><h3>  3. Organization of work. </h3><br>  Now, in my opinion, now it will be the most interesting, especially I recommend, to those readers who are “at the helm”, to turn their attention. <br><br><blockquote>  1. “Team spirit” and “Hand on pulse” </blockquote><br>  Often we see teams in which one says to the other - “I don’t know what it is, I only write scripts.”  Everyone has their own hut on the edge, and the manual is no exception. <br>  As a result, the idea of ​​the project as a whole gradually fades away in the eyes of developers, and then fades out in the eyes of management, as a result - a set of half-working pieces, each in its own juice. <br>  So, both for quality and for employee motivation, it is extremely important for each of the participants to understand the essence of the project, because when you see how your details complement the gear, and it starts to move and pulls other mechanisms along with you, it becomes aware of its importance.  “Wow, but it works!  Ha!  I'm a giant. ”  Hmm ... But how to do it?  This is where the “hand on the pulse” is needed, the task of the management is to follow the developer’s brains, and move them in the right direction, <strong>BUT the</strong> most important thing is to do it in such a way that the developer thinks that he himself comes to this!  Catch the moments when he wants to discuss something, when he has questions, and show his interest, you see soon your interest will be transferred to the employee. <br>  Kicking in the back (or below) you can only stimulate amorphous scoring, there should not be such people in a normal team, and therefore this method too. <br>  Team unity is also needed, the team must want to work together!  This, in my opinion, is achievable by the same method, if the management is attentive to all sides of the project, and this can be seen, this can serve as an example to action for all employees. <br>  Add here moments when you are given the opportunity to realize your idea.  If you want your employee to listen to the project, you at least need to listen to the employee.  Several times the ruined initiative, leaves in mind the installation that the initiative is not what you need. <br><blockquote>  2. Sensitivity, appreciation. </blockquote><br>  It always surprised me ... Why all Western leaders do not skimp on the banal ones: “Good Work!”, “Great, thanks a lot!”, “Keep it on like that!”.  And from our maximum that you hear - this is "Well, more or less, will go.".  What desire to try, to give the party the best years of your life, when at the end you hear "Well, it will come down ..."? <br><br><h3>  Summarize </h3><br>  If you think about the degree of significance of each of the 3 aspects, then: <br><ol><li>  The RFP has a criterion - “If it’s less than the norm, then you’ll all go to ...”.  This does not mean that you will succeed in achieving a great deal <strong>of</strong> motivation, but rather that insufficient salary destroys all attempts in two other aspects.  Accordingly - "Highest Priority." </li><li>  Interesting - it gives the desire to work, but not always the desire to be in a team.  And for complex projects, teamwork is a decisive factor.  I think this: for the developer it is “Medium Priority”, but for the leadership the team spirit is more important, meaning is “Low Priority”. </li><li>  Command - here I think so: for the developer it is “Low Priority”, “God bless her with the team, because I get paid and I do interesting things.”  But for the leadership of the team spirit is more important, which means - "Medium priority". </li></ol><br><br>  Here, perhaps, everything.  I know that I didn’t discover America, but I don’t remind you once again. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/17006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/17006/</a></p>
