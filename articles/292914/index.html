If you are lucky, you will be able to hear about the fundamental principles of kanban. <br><br>  Here I will try to present a different approach: one in which the principles are equally important (which, I think, should be in the first place, because they are not just called ‚Äúfundamental‚Äù), and the basic methods of identification according to the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat lie in their basis.  At the same time, we will cover most of the main elements of the method - perhaps it will go for a basic introduction to kanban! <a name="habracut"></a>

      Despite the comprehensive nature of the values, they correspond to the main goals of kanban (management of evolutionary organizational changes), and also help to clarify three misconceptions: <br><br><ul><li>  that kanban is some kind of software development process; </li><li>  that the kanban method does not contain any special values ‚Äã‚Äãthat are interesting to implement, so that it becomes a real challenge for the team, and at the same time be used as support for making organizational changes; </li><li>  that the kanban is only suitable for nerds, obsessed with counting indicators, working in organizations where everything is subject to strict control (I exaggerated the last misconception a bit). </li></ul><br>  Moreover, I also hope to show that the value-oriented description of the kanban method is also useful for other, more constructive reasons. <br><br><h4>  My starting point </h4><br>  From the fundamental principles of Kanban in the order in which they are usually listed, I highlight four values: understanding, agreement, respect, and leadership.  The first of them requires some explanation, and the rest can be taken literally. <br><br>  The values ‚Äã‚Äãbehind the six main practices of kanban are a bit more complicated, not because the practices are not based on values, but because there is no literal correspondence between practices and values.  I chose four more values ‚Äã‚Äã(now there are already eight): transparency, balance, organization of flow, and cooperation.  Nevertheless, it seemed to me that it would be useful to move away from the obvious sequence presented, and I was forced to add another additional value - customer focus.  Total nine values ‚Äã‚Äãturned out. <br><br>  As soon as I talk in detail about each of them, we will reveal a few more candidates for inclusion in the list of values: I will highlight in bold all that can be called value (mostly abstract nouns).  They are less important (as compared to those already mentioned), less obligatory for implementation, and are rather of an auxiliary character. <br><br><h4>  Nine Core Values ‚Äã‚Äãof the Kanban System </h4><br><h5>  1. Understanding </h5><br>  <b>Understanding</b> is one of the least obvious values ‚Äã‚Äãof kanban.  I put a special meaning in the first fundamental principle: "Start with what you are doing now."  Understand that you are changing, be it the smallest details of the process, performing the process under stressful conditions, or something abstract, such as your organization‚Äôs overall approach to change. <br><br><blockquote>  Insist on understanding, because a potentially ‚Äúworkable‚Äù process, the essence and purpose of which no one can explain, is a sign that you have forgotten what you are trying to achieve. <br>  <a href="http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2013/01/01/the_process_myth.html">The myth of the processes</a> , the blog Rands in Repose </blockquote><br>  In our training on kanban methodology, we teach systems thinking, which puts understanding very high in the list of priorities.  Questions for understanding are raised in the first paragraphs of the introduction to the method, they are the basis of the very first exercise.  Where does work come from?  What characterizes different types of work?  What approaches to problems of change and improvement, as a rule, lead to success, and which - to failure: in general and in your organization especially?  Why can this happen? <br><br>  By definition, lack of understanding is what characterizes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult">cargo-cult</a> realization.  Even with good intentions, there is a chance of losing meaning when change is imposed by the authorities from above, poorly justified (for example, the authorities rely too much on the attractiveness of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_practice">best practice</a> ).  And this change, remaining unreasonable, descends down the hierarchical steps of the organization.  It is not at all surprising that change projects tend to disappoint.  Unfortunately, for lazy or unqualified managers, <b>understanding</b> and related values ‚Äã‚Äã- <b>learning</b> and <b>leveling</b> require effort. <br><br><h5>  2. Agreement </h5><br>  <b>The agreement</b> is mentioned in the second fundamental principle: ‚ÄúPre-agree on important changes.‚Äù  I like to say it differently: do you expect success in implementing change without this [prior agreement]?  Could it be that precisely because of the lack of agreement your progress will face limitations?  Or, perhaps, there is some agreement, but not detailed enough: that is, you agree that the problem exists, but you do not see its causes or effects (that is, there is no <b>understanding</b> )? <br><br>  This principle seems to imply another value - <b>incrementalism</b> .  However, I would shy away from describing it as a core value, as we promote step-by-step, evolutionary changes, because they have a high chance of success, and not because the alternative options - <b>radicalism</b> or <b>conservatism</b> are no better.  And if <b>pragmatism</b> is a value, then it is very doubtful. <br><br><h5>  3. Respect </h5><br>  ‚ÄúRespect for people‚Äù is the core of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development">Lean</a> methodology.  Kanban applies it to the problem of organizational change in the third principle: "Respect the existing order, roles and responsibilities." <br><br>  As in life, it's good to lead change implementation with <b>respect</b> .  Will your chances of success increase if you start hinting that people are not doing a good job or not playing any important role?  Most likely no.  Is it helpful to suspect them of unreliability?  Again, no.  But does respect simply mean ‚Äúbeing good‚Äù?  And again not: <br><br><blockquote>  Showing respect for people does not mean that you are obliged to like you, that you must agree with their views and not dispute thoughtful reflections. <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/LeanVoices/status/284970927433850880">Stephen Perry</a> </blockquote><br>  Such respect requires <b>courage</b> , and this leads us to the next value. <br><br><h5>  4. Leadership </h5><br>  <b>Leadership</b> is mentioned in many success stories, but only in 2012 it was added to the fundamental principles in the form: ‚ÄúEncourage initiative at all levels in the organization - from every employee to the highest manager‚Äù. <br><br>  Much has already been written about leadership, and I will not write even more, just make some quick observations: <br><br><ol><li>  You may dream of a dictator leader, perhaps Steve Jobs (or Steve Balmer), but at each level the types of leadership differ. </li><li>  It is not only leadership that should be <b>appreciated</b> , management should not be despised either (remember <b>respect</b> ?). </li><li>  In addition, neither leadership nor management does not interfere with self-organization, where individuals, groups and systems are able to adapt without specifying their superiors.  Rather, good leadership and good governance create conditions in which self-organization flourishes. </li><li>  Good leadership includes <b>criticism</b> (we already talked about this above).  As initiators of change, we must be ready and dispute the opinions of others and accept criticism. </li></ol><br><h5>  5. Flow </h5><br>  Turning to the practices, we begin with the third: "Flow Control." <br><br>  In this practice, the word "management" speaks of tactical organization and decision-making aimed at work focused on the optimal result (talking about <b>efficiency</b> ).  Though with varying success, to some extent this is a universal strategy. <br><br>  <b>The flow</b> (‚Äúflow‚Äù) adds to the phrase a more specific meaning - a feeling of <b>smoothness</b> and <b>predictability</b> .  Given these sensations, systematically addressing issues related to inhibiting factors becomes an improvement tool, which is exemplified in the Lean methodology. <br><br>  We also appreciate the flow, as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi">Mihai Ciksikentmihaii</a> wrote, as a positive state of total immersion in what we are doing.  This kind of flow is difficult to ‚Äúcatch‚Äù when distraction is dominating the work environment, temporary stops and constantly changing priorities. <br><br><h5>  6. Customer focus </h5><br>  We haven't finished with Flow Control yet!  An extended version of this practice may look something like this: Throughout the entire period of work, strive to complete tasks on time and smoothly increase the value of your work for the client. <br><br>  The word ‚Äú <b>value</b> ‚Äù is understood both in the meaning of the <b>goal</b> (why the consumer needs it) and in the monetary sense (the main thing is not to confuse <b>utility</b> with value).  If we approach the phenomenon of <b>completion of work</b> , putting at the heart of the consumer, we must go beyond the process (‚ÄúThe task is fully completed‚Äù) or product (‚ÄúThe product is potentially ready for delivery‚Äù) approaches.  Based on my experience, this is an amazingly complex concept, the impact of which can be impressive. <br><br>  The work done, which does not yet benefit the client, is called non-refundable costs.  We will return to this issue and consider part of the phrase ‚Äúthroughout the term of work‚Äù, when we reach the value of balance. <br><br><h5>  7. Transparency </h5><br>  <b>Transparency</b> underlies the three main kanban practices at once: the first one ‚ÄúVisualize work‚Äù, the fourth one ‚ÄúMake politicians understandable to everyone‚Äù, and the fifth (another innovation in 2012) ‚ÄúImplement feedback‚Äù. <br>  Kanban proclaims transparency on several levels: <br><br><ol><li>  Making work visible; </li><li>  By making visible workflows through which individual tasks pass, and the states in which the individual tasks are located, at any given time; </li><li>  By making visible the parameters, policies, and constraints that guide the decision-making process and, ultimately, determine the overall performance of the system; </li><li>  Making visible the impact of all of the above on customer-oriented performance indicators. </li></ol><br>  The first two types of transparency naturally evolved from kanban systems, after which the method itself was named.  The first three together create shear points ‚Äî points in our systems where significant change can be made with relatively little cost and effort.  The fourth type (feedback loop) tells us that change leads us in the right direction. <br><br>  Kanban, therefore, is a way to develop systems that learn and adapt; it is a strategy of organizations that helps to find an opportunity to adapt to external conditions better than competitors. <br><br><h5>  8. Balance (balance) </h5><br>  The second main practice is ‚ÄúLimiting the Number of Tasks in Work (WIP)‚Äù.  There are several advantages to this limitation: <br><br><ol><li>  Due <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law">to Little's law</a> , the implementation time [Lead Time], and hence the feedback cycle is reduced;  the client gets what they want earlier and the learning of the [system] is accelerated. </li><li>  Work starts only when it is possible to perform it.  From the point of view of a separate job, this creates a <b>flow</b> , and from the point of view of a team or an employee (remember <b>respect</b> !), It keeps supply and demand in <b>balance</b> . </li><li>  With just one small detail, we can easily find a <b>balance</b> between different types of operational work, as well as between operational work and work to improve the system. </li></ol><br>  This clause implies another principle: ‚ÄúAccept diversity‚Äù.  Systems that work well in different directions are said to be <b>stable</b> , which is good for the client, for the organization, and for the employee ‚Äî another example of balance.  As part of the development of system resilience, the kanban method can add predictability to various types of individual work throughout the life of the work (dates can vary from a few hours or days to several months or more), and this is a really powerful improvement. <br><br>  More information about the meaning of balance in the kanban method can be found in David Anderson‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhen Kanban Doesn‚Äôt Fit You‚Äù [ <a href="http://vimeo.com/30637740">video</a> ], [ <a href="http://agilemanagement.net/images/uploads/KanbanWhenIsItNotAppropriate.pdf">slides</a> ].  My presentation ‚ÄúWhen Kanban is Not Simple‚Äù [ <a href="http://vimeo.com/52228737">video</a> ], [ <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/asplake/kanban-the-hard-way">slides</a> ] includes an explanation of the concepts of diversity and sustainability. <br><br><h5>  9. Collaboration </h5><br>  Cooperation appears in the sixth (and last) main practice ‚ÄúTo improve cooperation, develop experimentally [using models and a scientific approach]‚Äù. <br><br>  Taking into account the <b>agreement</b> , <b>respect</b> and <b>focus on the client</b> , the <b>cooperation</b> forms the expectation that the boundaries within our own team will be erased for the duration of the resolution of issues related to the factors arresting the flow. <br><br>  The complete formulation of this practice includes a reference to systematic work aimed at improving <b>understanding</b> through observation, model building, experiments, and measurements ( <b>empiricism</b> ). <br><br>  ‚ÄúUsing models‚Äù has a second meaning, suggesting the presence of such values ‚Äã‚Äãas <b>curiosity</b> and even <b>generosity</b> .  Kanban actively encourages his followers to seek solutions that are not yet reflected in the methodology in order to expand the existing knowledge base. <br><br>  Kanban recognizes the fundamentals of Lean methodology, the theory of constraints and Agile, the principles of queuing theory and complex sciences, and has [the development of companies] the same varied influence as the concept of Lean Startup.  Individual kanban followers have their own favorite models ‚Äî for example, I rely on A3, GROW, and Influencer. <br><br><h4>  Why are nine values ‚Äã‚Äãenough? </h4><br>  I was worried that the ‚Äú <b>client-oriented</b> ‚Äù value of the Lean methodology cannot be inferred from standard language, basic principles, and kanban methods ‚Äî you could say that I must have deceived you!  But I think she fully deserves her place. <br><br>  And here are the other values ‚Äã‚Äãthat I defined: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Learning</b> and <b>alignment are</b> strongly associated with <b>understanding</b> .  I fully acknowledge that it is possible to come up with a situation in which both these values ‚Äã‚Äãwill be important, but I think that my situation best reflects the essence of the foundations of kanban in systems thinking.  The <a href="http://positiveincline.com/index.php/2010/06/learning-together-kanban-and-the-twelve-principles-of-agile-software/">article</a> I refer to most often emphasizes the importance of learning, so it was difficult for me [not to write about learning]! </li><li>  <b>Challenge</b> (as well as <b>vision</b> ) and <b>courage are</b> implied within the framework of <b>leadership</b> , so I do not consider these two values ‚Äã‚Äãas fundamental.  Here is a <a href="http://positiveincline.com/index.php/2012/11/dole-out-the-3cs/">post</a> on this topic. </li><li>  <b>Self-organization</b> would be necessary when designing an organizational structure, but <b>respect</b> seems to be a more appropriate guide for the initiator of change.  Other things being equal, respect involves making decisions that allow or develop self-organization. </li><li>  I often think of <b>sustainability</b> as a value, but it describes the result more than the approach itself.  The same goes with <b>smoothness</b> and <b>predictability</b> . </li></ol><br><h4>  How to make values ‚Äã‚Äãwork </h4><br>  Let's look at our nine values: <br><br>  <b>Understanding, Agreement, Respect,</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Leadership, Flow, Customer Orientation,</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Transparency, Balance, Collaboration.</b> <br><br>  This is a pretty long list.  Longer than the original of the three or four values ‚Äã‚Äãthat I quoted for some time at every opportunity, but not so long that we could not discuss them all, recall, and refer to them. <br><br>  Do some values ‚Äã‚Äãhave a greater response than others?  What does this tell you?  I could explain this with the example of leadership - the differences between practitioners and method followers can be very revealing! <br><br>  It seems to you that something is missing in your current [working] environment?  Again, what does this tell you?  Does this help identify the things that really need to be properly organized? <br><br>  For example, I recall times when the absence of the right type of agreement led either to a slowdown in the pace of change or to a change from which it was too easy to return to its original state.  Based on what I read, I believe that I am not alone in my opinion. <br><br> <a href="http://msk15.leankanban.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/661/145/d75/661145d75bf942e0b61d28331083d005.png"></a> <br><br>  <i><b>PS</b> Mike Barrows (original author) is one of the speakers of the thematic conference <a href="http://msk15.leankanban.ru/">Lean Kanban Russia</a> , which will be held in Moscow from 2 to 3 October 2015.</i>  <i><a href="http://msk15.leankanban.ru/members/registration/">Registration is now open</a> - we invite you to actively participate!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292914/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292914/</a></p>
