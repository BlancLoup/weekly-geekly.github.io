  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Self-study English is the optimal organization of time. Practice classes on the method Umin for computer and smartphone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The Umin method is one of the most popular alternative methods of learning a foreign language, it has been known for over 20 years and has many hundreds of reviews in the press and the Internet.  The method was published in 1993 in the book by <i>Umin Ye. A. ‚ÄúForeign Easily and Gladly</i> ‚Äù (50 p., Available on the Internet).  The author of the method, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences Evgeny Alekseevich Umryukhin, in an interview tells about his possibilities as follows: <br>  <i>- I have seen many examples when, after half a year of studying a language with my method, a person got the opportunity to communicate on it, imperfectly, making certain mistakes or experiencing sometimes difficulties in expressing complex thoughts.</i>  <i>But in communication, perception of speech and reading books in a foreign language, these difficulties were quickly overcome.</i>  <i>The proposed method is effective because it differs significantly from many standard ones.</i> <br><br>  The method itself is based on the scientific research of E. A. Umryukhin on the functioning of the brain, described, for example, in the books <i>‚ÄúBrain Mechanisms: Information Model and Learning Optimization‚Äù</i> (1999), <i>‚ÄúMedical and Biological Aspects of Intellectual Activity‚Äù</i> (2004) , as well as in the courses taught by him, including in MSTU.  Bauman, where I met him and his research. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Like other effective methods of learning languages, the method applies the method of immersing a student into the language being studied.  The peculiarity of the method is that immersion in a language is much more intensive than in regular courses or at a tutor, thanks to special listening and pronouncing exercises performed daily according to a specific program. <br>  Another feature of the method is that (especially after selecting the material and mastering the exercises) there is no need for the participation of the teacher there, you can work on the program yourself.  Accordingly, the cost of training is much cheaper than on courses or with a tutor, although the speed of progress in mastering a language per hour of study is higher. <br><br>  To understand the processes taking place in teaching a foreign language, you can apply this analogy - the language environment, we will consider speech as a container with water, and a student - as an oak bar that needs to be completely immersed in it, so that it does not pop up.  And the learning process will be considered as the gradual soaking of the bar with water. <br>  The most effective is, of course, the constant stay of the tree in the water - that is, the student's permanent stay in a foreign language environment, abroad, with limited communication in the native language.  In this case, the learning process will be the fastest and deepest. <br>  Lessons in a group or with a tutor can be considered as periodic immersion of a tree in water, while the rest of the time it lies in the air and dries.  With sufficient frequency and duration of such dives, the tree is also sufficiently saturated with water, i.e. the language will be mastered at a certain level.  And with insufficient intensity, it will remain almost dry, that is, language acquisition will not occur. <br>  The Umin method, with this analogy, can be viewed as a set of organizational measures to minimize the time it takes a tree to soak with water ‚Äî choosing the optimal dive mode, as well as adding some artificial components to the water that accelerate the impregnation.  That is, the choice of the optimal duration and frequency of classes, as well as the use of special intensive exercises with audio materials instead of the usual lessons.

      <b>Objectives of the material presented:</b> <br>  - Shift method from the book Umin c using a computer and a smartphone instead of a tape recorder and radio; <br>  - To share my personal experience in the practice of applying the method, to give my own vision of the moments from the book, which seemed to me not quite clear; <br>  - Specify the values ‚Äã‚Äãof parameters used by me from the book, which the author leaves for the reader to choose. <br><br>  This material, in fact, describes my experience (successful experience) of working with the Umin method and the implementation of its elements with the help of modern technical tools instead of obsolete ones. <br>  When presenting, I tried to use only materials that are freely available on the Internet, as well as minimize (at least at the first stage) the use of online services (such as Yotube) in order to keep the method working in the absence of a permanent Internet connection and, thus , make the course more accessible for mobile devices that do not have a fixed connection. <br><br>  <b>Tools and materials for learning a foreign language (implementation option)</b> <br><br>  <b>Language course: Gimson - Intermediate English</b> <br>  The course is available for download on the Internet and contains 21 (or 20, depending on the edition) program, each of which consists of 3 texts, a total of 63 (or 60) fragments.  It is advisable to use a publication that is larger, but it can be limited to a smaller one. <br><br>  01A..63 - a fragment of the language course - to correspond to the material of the book, renamed from Program # Text # as follows: <br><br>  Program1Text1 - 01A <br>  Program1Text2 - 02B <br>  Program1Text3 - 03B <br>  Program2Text1 - 04 <br>  Program2Text2 - 05D <br>  ... <br>  Program21Text2 - 62Y <br>  Program21Text3 - 63Y <br><br>  Separate smaller fragments will also be used, for which it will be more convenient to have your own separate audio files: <br>  Each of the fragments 01A, 02B, 03B is divided into three approximately equal parts 01A1, 01A2, 01A3 ... 03B3 <br>  Each of the fragments 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09 is divided into two approximately equal parts 041, 042, 051 ... 092 <br><br>  01.mp3‚Ä¶ 63.mp3 - corresponding audio files of the language course <br>  01-rus.doc‚Ä¶ 63-rus.doc - Russian texts of the language course <br>  01-eng.doc‚Ä¶ 63-eng.doc - English texts of the language course <br>  If there is an opportunity to study daily on the computer, then they can be viewed from the screen while performing the exercises. <br>  If there is no possibility of daily access to the computer and at least part of the classes will be conducted using a smartphone, then all these texts will need to be printed on paper in order to see the entire text of the fragment during the exercises. <br><br>  <b>British Council Phonemic Chart (Sounds)</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/phonemic-chart">www.teachingenglish.org.uk/article/phonemic-chart</a> (the page has links for downloading offline versions in swf and exe format). <br><br>  Alternatively, instead of this page, you can use the file Sounds.mp3 from the language course of the previous level: Gimson - English for Beginners.  The following is a listing of Sounds.mp3, because it is not available in the copies available on the Internet: <br>  <i>Youn‚Äôt be happy, you‚Äôre not happy, but you‚Äôre not happy to go.</i> <br><br>  In the case when there is no promotion at the rate of Intermediate English (for example, if you can‚Äôt do the exercise L5 for two weeks - listening to the fragment with the recollection of the content, despite the daily activities and the correct exercise), you can try to use the English for Beginners course in full volume instead of Intermediate English.  But, most likely, everything should work out normally, even if from the very beginning Intermediate English will be used with zero knowledge of the language. <br><br>  <b>Textbook V.S. Shakh-Nazarov, K.V. Zhuravchenko - English for You</b> <br>  From there, sections with phonetic rules, sections with short grammatical rules and word substitution tables will be used. <br><br>  <b>Textbook KN Kachalova, E. E. Izrailevich - Practical grammar of the English language with exercises and keys (in 2 volumes)</b> <br>  From there, a detailed grammatical description and exercises will be used to replace the missing words with keys. <br>  Both the textbooks just mentioned can be downloaded on the Internet. <br><br>  <b>Adapted art books in English</b> <br>  Usually the texts of adapted books are simplified and contain only the most commonly used words, and they, as a rule, are supplied with comments with explanations and translations of complex expressions and words. <br>  Such books can be purchased or printed downloaded on the Internet, such searches can be used in a search engine for searching: <br>  <i>adapted parallel texts</i> <i><br></i>  <i>adapted books with translation</i> <i><br></i>  <i>etc.</i> <br>  A good example of the adaptation of books are books on the method of Frank. <br>  Choose an adapted book should be such that when reading (exercise K1) understand its contents (perhaps with the help of comments in the book).  In total, you will need about 10-15 such books. <br><br>  <b>Unadapted art books in English with translation</b> <br>  These books can be purchased or printed downloaded on the Internet, the paper version will need to be necessary, because during the exercises you will need to make marks in the text. <br>  You must have a translation of the book into Russian.  It is desirable that the Russian translation was in parallel with the English text, page to page.  There should also be a correspondence of the level of complexity of the book to the current level of language. <br>  When making a decision on reading a particular book, one should randomly select 2-3 paragraphs from it (7-10 lines each) and read them.  If the general meaning of paragraphs is understandable without translation (albeit with the possibility of having separate incomprehensible words), then it is suitable for reading using the translation (Exercise K2). <br><br>  <b>Unadapted art books in English without translation</b> <br><br>  <b>Techniques used in the classroom (option implementation)</b> <br><br>  For definiteness, all techniques are indicated here for fragment 01A, the application of LX reception to any fragment of the language course Y in the number of Z times will be denoted as follows: <br>  Y - LX: Z <br>  For example: <b>03 - 2: 4</b> <br>  - means that reception <b>L2</b> will be applied to a fragment of the language course <b>03B</b> for <b>4</b> times. <br><br>  So, for fragment 01A, the methods of the Umin method will have the following form: <br><br>  <b>L1</b> - listening to audio recording 01A.mp3 <br><br>  <b>L2</b> - listening to the audio record 01A.mp3 with simultaneous tracking of the English printout 01-eng.doc <br><br>  <b>L3</b> - sorting out the meaning of the fragment 01A - we look through each line in the English printout 01A-eng.doc and the corresponding line in the Russian printout 01A-eng.doc - line by line, first the first lines, then the second lines, etc. until their end. <br><br>  <b>L4</b> - listening to the audio record 01A.mp3 with simultaneous tracking on the Russian printout 01A-rus.doc <br><br>  <b>L5</b> - listening to the audio record 01A.mp3 without tracking the printouts while recalling its contents.  The difference between P5 and P2 is that P2 is performed without an understanding of the meaning of the fragment, and P5 - with an understanding of the meaning. <br><br>  <b>L6</b> - speaking right after the announcer of the audio file 011.mp3 with simultaneous tracking of the English printout 01-eng.doc, without interrupting the playback of the audio recording.  In this case, there is no need to pronounce absolutely correctly, you can, for a start, pronounce it as qualitatively as possible.  The file is 01A1.mp3 instead of 01A.mp3 - to emphasize that, first, lesson fragments of the language course will be used for the exercises L6-L9 first. <br><br>  <b>L7</b> - pronunciation of the audio file 01A1.mp3 immediately after the speaker without following the printouts. <br><br>  <b>L8</b> - pronunciation of English printout 011-eng.doc without playing an audio file. <br><br>  <b>L9</b> - pronunciation on English printout 01A1-eng.doc directly in front of the announcer when playing audio file 01A1.mp3 <br><br>  Further exercises L10 and L11 are the controls, they should be performed once a month, for three sessions in a row.  If during the development of the course any part has caused particular difficulties with pronunciation, then it is desirable to carry them out just for this part. <br><br>  <b>L10</b> - open the printout 01A-eng.doc; <br>  start playing audio file 01A.mp3; <br>  start the recorder (a program for recording sound); <br>  The following actions are performed in a loop while the audio file lasts: <br>  - we wait until the announcer says the phrases into 2-3 lines of printout; <br>  - turn off playback; <br>  - we pronounce the speaker's phrase on the dictaphone; <br>  - turn on playback. <br>  The result will be a record containing the recordings of the announcer interspersed with pronouncing.  We listen to her. <br><br>  <b>L11</b> - is performed in the same way as L10 - speaking, recording and checking the received record on a dictaphone;  The difference is that the speaker's phrases are spoken not after the speaker, but in front of him, according to the printout 04-eng.doc <br><br>  <b>L12</b> - we write out from the covered material 3 phrases from everyday communication, which are well pronounced;  then for each of the phrases we imagine a situation where we could pronounce it, we say it out loud 3 times;  it is also advisable to say the phrase to oneself when the situation arises during the next day;  phrases themselves can be changed to other times a week. <br>  This exercise is the least formalized of all the others in the method.  Its meaning is to create a direct connection between objects and situations encountered in everyday life and phrases of a foreign language, without using phrases of the native language as intermediaries. <br><br>  <b>K1</b> - reading adapted books with an understanding of the meaning of the read. <br><br>  <b>K2</b> - reading unadapted books using the translation with the repetition of new words <br>  We write today's date in the margins of the book opposite the place from which we are starting to read now.  We read the book sentence by sentence: <br>  - if the sentence is completely clear, then read on. <br>  - if the sentence as a whole is understandable, but any word or phrase is not clear - we look at a parallel translation, find out the meaning of an incomprehensible place in the Russian text, underline the incomprehensible word or phrase in the English text and tick the box in the English text opposite this place. <br>  - if the sentence as a whole is not clear - we look at a parallel translation, if from a parallel translation we understand the meaning of all the words of the sentence - we emphasize the most problematic of them in the English text and also put a tick in the margin, and if the meaning of any words is unclear - mark the sentence with a wavy line in the fields and read on. <br>  So we do, until we read until there are 20 check marks in the fields.  After the last sentence read, we draw a horizontal line in the margins and move on to repeating the words studied in previous lessons with K2. <br>  We look through the places with tick marks and underscores in the English text that refer to the following dates (if we cannot remember the meaning of the word, then we look at it in the Russian translation): <br>  - 25 days ago <br>  - 11 days ago <br>  - 4 days ago <br>  - 2 days ago <br>  - 1 day ago <br>  - for today - once again we look through the newly found words. <br>  When viewing a fragment for each of the days, we put a dot near the date written in the margin (total, ultimately, 6 dots should appear in front of each of the dates as the lessons are taken. This fragment can be considered as passed. <br>  The original method provides for the implementation of exercise K2 2-3 times a day - the first repetition should be done not immediately after the class, but after a few hours, and the second after 12 hours (i.e. the first repetition in the original method occurs a few hours later, and the second - a few hours earlier).  However, during classes I decided to simplify the scheme somewhat and limit the classes one time a day.  This, of course, causes some damage to the quality of work with the book, but it provides a much simpler and more convenient schedule of classes. <br><br>  <b>K3</b> - reading unadapted books using the translation without repeating the new words. <br>  Can be used when the number of new words found is 3-5 per page.  At the same time, we only look into the Russian text to find out their meaning, and it should not be emphasized, highlighted and repeated. <br><br>  <b>K4</b> - reading unadapted books without the use of translation. <br><br>  <b>C1</b> - We look through the textbook of Shakh-Nazarov parts I and II in lessons 1-4 (‚ÄúLetters and sounds‚Äù and ‚ÄúIntonation‚Äù) - pp. 12-19, 29-34, 47-49, 66-68.  This exercise is not necessary to do. <br><br>  <b>C2</b> - We look through the textbook of Shakh-Nazarov part IV in lessons 1-6 (‚ÄúGrammar‚Äù) - pp. 22-25, 37-39, 51-56, 70-75, 90-93, 109-111.  and parts I (‚ÄúNew Grammar Structures‚Äù) from lessons 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23‚Äì pp. 126-138, 153-159, 174-181, 194-199, 216 -226, 243-254, 272-281, 301-311, 329-333.  This exercise is not necessary to do. <br><br>  <b>C3</b> - Using material from C2 and C5 as a reference tool. <br><br>  <b>C4</b> - We write out the proposals from the tables of the textbook of Shah-Nazarov - pp. 53-54 (Lesson 3 - IV - paragraph 4), 71 (4-IV-2), 90 (5-IV-1), 133 (7-1 -6), 153 (9-1-1), 174 (11-1-1), 176 (11-1-2), 194 (13-1-1), 216 (15-1-1), 245 (17-1-2), 250-251 (17-1-6), 272 (19-1-1), 279 (19-1-4), 303 (21-I-2), 329 (23- I-1). <br>  It will be convenient to print the corresponding pages of the textbook. <br><br>  <b>C5</b> - We are reviewing the first volume of the Kachalov-Izrailevich textbook, figuring out the incomprehensible points from the previously studied material. <br><br>  <b>C6</b> - We look through the 2nd volume of the Kachalov-Izrailevich textbook, we choose the exercises for inserting the missing words in the English text.
