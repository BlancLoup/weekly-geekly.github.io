      The event, according to the program, was supposed to take place from 11:00 to 16:30.  Because of the work, I was not able to come to the beginning, but I managed to reach the final of the first report devoted to the opensource solutions used on desktops for scientific activities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8af/f84/c51/8aff84c51fed273a5c0500fc37c3b688.jpg"><br><br>  Since the event was held in the format of "open doors", or rather, an open door, the flow of participants through itself was quite active.  Unfortunately, there were more people going out than there were incoming ones - perhaps the reason was the alluring opportunity to get free coffee in the corridor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9d8/fc9/c21/9d8fc9c21fc37bf6131e4edc0ef559f7.jpg"><br><br>  Subsequent presentations - a presentation on ‚ÄúSteam for Linux‚Äù, reports ‚ÄúAsterisk and hardware for its work‚Äù (about the Asterisk project - an open source communication platform that has all the features of a classic PBX and supports many VoIP protocols) Continious Deployment by means of free software ‚Äù(mainly Puppet and Jenkins were considered) were also held in a very small audience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d46/43d/1e9/d4643d1e9dacfbbe83121ddfa91252dd.jpg"><br><br>  True, a full house was observed throughout the day in a small office where, in a master class format, the features of embedded systems based on the Linux kernel were demonstrated.  One of the devices on which the demonstration was based was the Raspberry Pi minicomputer.  And in this office a little later, all sorts of technical problems were solved with recklessness and other interesting things happened. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6ef/fc6/908/6effc6908caa5685cc9d37585c9877a8.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/172/dee/8de/172dee8de05c1953accb33325a0384ed.jpg"><br><br>  Another event of Software Freedom Day in Saratov was, of course, the installation of free software by all comers, which took place in the corridor.  So, as a gift for those who came, Fedora boot disks were offered;  In addition, the organizers - and not only they - offered guests to use flash drives with other Linux distributions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/edf/696/562/edf696562f5d53ca8ed23c9ab09b8064.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d8c/7f0/391/d8c7f0391a004a67e47047738bdf96cd.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, on the terminal, which can be seen in the previous photo, open software was also installed. <br><br>  The overall impression of the event remained pleasant, but still I did not leave the feeling of some Kafka‚Äôs understatement.  At 16 o'clock most of the participants have already diverged in English;  earlier, between presentations of speakers, sometimes long breaks gaped, and pauses were filled with cartoons or playing of symbolic prizes (these were mostly badges and stickers). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c40/aec/420/c40aec420e4fc05076139750e9e988d2.jpg"><br><br>  Instead of such interruptions, one could either make the program more saturated or fit it in a shorter period.  In a conversation with one of the organizers ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/AgaFonOff/">AgaFonOff</a> ), who acknowledged some confusion of the festival this year, it turned out that the second way is closer to them - that is, reducing the time of the event.  The organizers cannot be blamed - these are busy people who do everything on the same enthusiasm.  But, I hope, in the coming years, the duration of Software Freedom Day in Saratov will still not rush to zero - in our city any IT events do not happen too often. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d8b/57f/c71/d8b57fc71627ca53ebb4cedbc3707fb2.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151539/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151539/</a></p>
