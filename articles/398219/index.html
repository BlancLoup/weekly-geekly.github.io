  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Avtofon" - a real way to find a stolen car</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Cars are becoming more and more, and many of them are of particular interest to the hijackers.  Despite the fact that anti-theft systems are being improved, the teams of intruders also do not stand still, and are developing more and more new ways to bypass the protection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/723/5f3/ece/7235f3eceb58438883abff578bcb6013.jpg"><br><br>  The easiest way to hijacking consists of several stages.  The first is the inclusion of a jammer (or noise generator).  Thanks to this device, a built-in alarm system of a certain type is deactivated (there are many of them, and far from all are eliminated in this way, there is also a variant with an algorithmic or replacement code grabber).  Then a special carbide ingot is inserted into the larva of the door and lock, a key with a head, which is then turned. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  A special electronic device is connected to the standard connector in the car, which allows you to register your chip in the memory of the immobilizer.  After that, if there are no other protection systems, the car starts and the hijacker takes him to a special place.  This may be the place where the car is taken apart.  And maybe the next yard, where the car is left to "sucks".  During the forced idle time, the auto batteries of the protective systems are gradually discharged (the standard battery is disconnected) and the vehicle becomes transportable.

    <h3>  Hijacked a car?  Can help beacon </h3><br>  Protect the car from theft is not easy, although it is possible.  The second way to protect your car is to install a beacon to search for an already stolen car.  ‚ÄúAutophone Alfa-Beacon‚Äù - GPS beacon, which allows you to find a car a few weeks after the hijacking.  The device has a very small size.  It should be hidden inside the car, and turn it on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6f6/0e0/122/6f60e0122226018db40a585fa1c2f39e.jpg"><br><br>  The system includes a GPS / GLONASS receiver, a GSM module and batteries.  In sleep mode, they last for several months.  In this case, the standard scheme of ‚Äúsludge cars‚Äù of intruders does not work - the batteries will not be discharged in a few days, they do not even last for several months, but for 1-3 years of work. <br><br>  The main mode of the lighthouse is sleep.  It does not emit any signals at this time.  "Communication" with the owner is only once or twice a day, during the awakening of the device.  Sets the frequency of waking up programmatically, sets the user parameters. <br><br>  By the way, AvtoFon is equipped with a microphone, so you can call and listen to what is happening around.  True, you need to understand that in this case there is a significant battery consumption. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/361/6a5/306/3616a5306df54f4bb5ea31cf383ff066.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/58c/186/d75/58c186d7572e46b2b8feffef6fb3d40b.png"><br><br>  The GSM module is assigned a permanent phone number (works only in the Russian Federation).  If the hijacking has occurred, you need to send a message to the beacon number, and it will become a wake-up signal for the device. <br><br><h3>  What is AvtoFon? </h3><br>  This is one of the smallest GPS beacons on the market, which operate according to the principle described above. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42d/4c8/c6c/42d4c8c6ca0d70fa20f880e6dfc2a6c9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff5/0ce/fbb/ff50cefbb0ab6d8f7cde166f63056dde.jpg"><br><br>  The device is already out of the box.  In the package - the device itself, a 2-sided tape for attaching the system and a cover (the beacon can be used not only for cars, but also for people).  With such a beacon, you can, for example, send a child to school or track the movement of an important load. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/65f/8c6/b3b/65f8c6b3b73f943417892b4017845e52.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f41/a0f/e37/f41a0fe37ffed7a03367ca705289a575.jpg"><br><br>  To get started, you just need to get the device out of the package, turn it on and hide it in the car or give it to the person who will wear it.  The batteries included in the package during basic operation (sleep and periodic awakening) last for 2-3 years of the device.  In active mode, the charge will last for several days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ff8/255/980/ff8255980381a25c7f703dfc0e689362.jpg"><br><br>  It is worth noting that the GPS chip is located in the case from the side of the logo on the case.  Therefore, it is desirable to place this side up.  And it is highly recommended to place the device so that there is not much metal above that will screen the signal. <br><br>  Turning on the device is simple - you need to quickly press a button 5 times.  After that, the beacon can be hidden.  In the basic mode of operation, the beacon is activated once a day.  During the wake-up, the registration is performed in the mobile network, after which the coordinates are sent to the AutoPhone server via GSM-towers (the so-called LBS coordinates).  Sending a signal, the device falls asleep again.  If, on waking, the beacon receives a command via SMS, it executes it. <br><br>  ‚ÄúAvtoFon‚Äù already comes with prepaid GPRS traffic.  In the basic mode of operation, the payment lasts for 3 years.  After the limit ends, you will have to pay. <br><br>  To track the location of the device you need to register ( <a href="http://control.autofon.ru/">this is here</a> ).  You can work not with the site, but with the application <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.autofon" rel="nofollow noopener">(Android</a> / iOS)</b> .  The functionality of the site and the application is about the same, it allows you to: <br><br>  - see the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe last activation of the Mayak (remember that the Mayak when activated - fixes its coordinates by LBS (on the base towers)), the date and time of the next <br>  - see the battery status, signal level. <br>  - see the time of the last activation and the nearest activation <br>  - send a command to get GPS coordinates <br>  - turn on the mode of frequent reporting of coordinates (‚Äúcombat mode‚Äù = activation every 30 minutes + GPS coordinates) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a32/0ce/5d5/a320ce5d53d07a251d5819f0e9e05746.jpg"><br><br>  LBS coordinates, as always, are approximate.  When working with GPS localization occurs much more accurately. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b8b/85e/e82/b8b85ee8278fdf5a371c69590bc25c67.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Car hijacked now what? </h3><br>  In this case, immediately or after some time it is necessary to turn on the "combat" mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/523/9b4/830/5239b48305ff4ecd0209d48b5bc7f356.jpg"><br><br>  After that, you need to wait for the receipt of the command beacon.  If the command is received, AvtoFon will start activating every 30 minutes, sending the coordinates to the owner. <br><br>  If you do not want to work with the basic mode, you can try to customize the device for personal preferences.  However, after this, it is no longer possible to return the base mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/31c/b40/ab3/31cb40ab3c3ae9259fc113169a9fd561.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6a0/a70/520/6a0a705203a0ea4baeceb53de8a074e3.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8fc/bb7/8e5/8fcbb78e546b63c711be53d80bc432c2.jpg"><br><br>  After this, perform the following steps: <br>  - we see the beacon mobile number <br>  - we see our balance "in GPRS packages" and in rubles <br>  - we get access to SETUP setup of the BEACON <br>  - we get the opportunity to send commands to the BEACON - via GPRS and via SMS -c from any phone or from the application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/53f/fce/57b/53ffce57bba01b896ae1b370e1ea5cea.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/627/796/551/6277965516bf55d2d2651668ecd8978d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15e/5fc/339/15e5fc33919c2ce1263998b4e45ed3c1.jpg"><br><br>  If desired, you can perform the following operations: <br>  - change the activation time to constantly.  For example, 2 p / day or more.  Or less <br>  - change the scheme of work upon activation (determine coordinates, etc., sending intervals, methods of determination, etc.) For example - with each activation - send coordinates or immediately - a hyperlink to the map with the exact position of the vehicle. <br>  - send coordinates immediately in the form of a hyperlink. <br>  - reconfigure the control button <br><br>  When stealing, it is recommended to do the following <br><br>  Write a statement to the police. <br>  Call Autophone Response. <br><br>  As soon as the AutoPhone reports the location of the car, the specialists will take over the further control of the device.  And also, the interaction with the police to search for and return the property - in your interests! <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DwKnp9fA_Fuk">www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKnp9fA_Fuk</a> <br><br>  There are quite a few additional functions, so there would be a desire, and it will be possible to implement your idea without problems.  The main thing is to understand that if you configure something wrong, the device will not be able to adequately react to the commands.  If you are not sure - no need to touch. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa7/e3c/90d/aa7e3c90d39bf57199643d71dddc3fbf.jpg"><br><br>  You can manage ‚ÄúAutophone‚Äù as you please - via a browser, an application or by SMS.  It is best to practice working with the device in advance so that in case of trouble you can meet the problem fully armed.  To improve the reliability of detecting a car when it is stolen, you can put two devices at once - if one is found, the second one will probably go unnoticed. <br><br>  Report on settings and parameters can be obtained by SMS (including battery level): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/396/c83/a60/396c83a60655fbfb069233d44fd96041.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Specifications:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Appendix: Ability to upgrade firmware via GPRS </li><li>  Setting the time: by GPS </li><li>  Battery Capacity: 1100 mAh;  4.5 volts </li><li>  Batteries: specialized battery pack </li><li>  Case type: plastic with elastic cap </li><li>  Overall dimensions: 593820 mm </li><li>  Navigation: GLONASS / GPS </li><li>  GSM module model: SIM800H </li><li>  Model GPS module and its chipset: GLOBALTOP MTK3333 </li><li>  GPS antenna size: 18x18 mm </li><li>  Audio monitoring capability: yes, in full access mode </li><li>  Battery Discharge Control: Yes </li><li>  SOS panic button in the device: Yes </li><li>  Post language: Russian / English </li><li>  Autonomous work: up to 3 years </li><li>  Determination of temperature: Yes </li><li>  GPRS monitoring support: Yes </li><li>  Positioning in GSM bases: LBS </li></ul><br>  For Geektimes readers, we offer a 10% discount on AvtoFon using the <a href="https://dadget.ru/katalog/avto-moto-velo/signalizacija-avtofon-alfa-mayak/%3Futm_referrer%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_term%3Dsignalizacija-avtofon-alfa-mayak%26utm_content%3Dsignalizacija-avtofon-alfa-mayak%26utm_campaign%3Dsignalizacija-avtofon-alfa-mayak_327">GEEKT-AM2</a> code. <br><br>  <b>As well as information for bloggers and authors:</b> <br>  The company "Dadzhet" is interested in publishing independent objective reviews of dadzhetov in various kinds of media.
