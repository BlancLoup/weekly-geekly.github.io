  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Development vs. Testing, or where to go graduate FVT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2d/190/87d/e2d19087d4ea42acabe645b73bf38186.jpg" align="left">  Among a certain part of IT professionals there is an opinion that software development and testing should be considered as antagonist processes.  Indeed, source code writing, design development, etc.  - these are creative processes, while testing is always destructive.  Against the background of the specifics of their activities, various workers, and sometimes personal, conflicts constantly arise between the specialists of the two areas.  Therefore, development and testing teams often confront each other, and employees are divided into "alien" and "their".  What is the camp to join the beginner IT?  We will try to analyze both directions and answer this question. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It is considered that the development is more intellectual, creative, and as a result, a more paid area than testing.  This is one of the famous myths regarding the profession of the tester and is nothing more than a subjective opinion of individual individuals.  From the objective point of view, each specialist performs his own unique stack of tasks.  For a programmer, this is writing code, interface design, unit testing, learning and applying optimal constructs and algorithms, as well as matching patterns.  The tester needs knowledge of the subject area, analogues of the system being implemented on the market, knowledge of typical errors of such systems, in addition, the design and execution of tests also requires knowledge of test design techniques, and in the case of automation, it becomes necessary to understand modern auto-testing tools, their features and restrictions. <br><br>  Another no less common is the myth that testing is a more routine job.  In fact, it all depends on the specific project and the specific role on it.  In the process of testing, there really is a need to regress, which is not famous for its diversity.  At the same time, the tester may participate in the creation of a new automation framework, or engage in manual testing of the new functionality.  The same principle is true for any developer: depending on the role being played, the specialist can support the existing components or take part in the creation of new ones.

      Many are interested in the issue of remuneration, namely the difference in salaries of a developer and a tester.  At the stage of origin of the QA region, perhaps this difference was not in favor of the latter.  Nowadays, the delta has practically leveled out, and in some cases it exceeds the cost of the programmer‚Äôs services - it all depends on the project, the person‚Äôs experience, his skills and the significance of these skills for the team. <br><br>  And finally, thanks to the myths and opinions described above, many young professionals who have no experience in development, but nevertheless consider this area ‚Äúimbic‚Äù to try to get by junior or regular software developer by hook or by crook.  In particular, using the position of the tester as a springboard for further transition.  The most interesting thing in this case is that the majority of such applicants in the future decide to link their lives with QA. <br><br>  So, to summarize: most of the stereotypes regarding the profession of testers do not have an objective basis.  At the moment, both directions are equal.  A creative, ambitious person is able to express himself in both areas.  It is impossible to say unequivocally that the activity in one of them is clearly more interesting than in the other, just as the opposite cannot be said.  Before making a decision, it is necessary to get acquainted with specific responsibilities in detail, and it is better to work for a while as a tester and as a developer.  Only then can a person be able to determine with certainty which path is closer to him.  Moreover, it will avoid the spread of certain misconceptions and increase the overall professionalism of the employee - understanding the tasks of both departments will reduce the likelihood of conflicts and misunderstandings in the team. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to note that, of course, testing and development are two integral parts of one process.  Without one, one way or another, there will be no other.  Therefore, no matter what position or role you are in, always respect the work of your colleagues. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247759/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247759/</a></p>
