As everyone already knows, everyone's beloved company, Intel, slightly ‚Äúnipped up‚Äù during design or already during production in Sandy Bridge chipsets (What has already been <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/112926/">reported on Habr√©</a> ), but all official sources said that the game was withdrawn and became the owner of a computer on these chipsets is impossible.  Almost ... <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The performance of the notebook is really good compared to others in terms of price and performance: 15.6 '' (1366x768) LED / Intel Core i7-2630QM (2.0 GHz) / RAM 4 GB / HDD 500 GB / NVIDIA GeForce GT540M, 1 GB / DVD Super Multi / LAN / Wi-Fi / Bluetooth / Webcam / Windows 7 Home Premium / 2.71 kg.  So when buying, I didn‚Äôt even pay attention, and if I‚Äôd get such a machine, I‚Äôll either replace the motherboard or replace the laptop.  Yes, and official statements on the manufacturer's website and statements for the press reassured.  <a href="http://event.asus.com/2011/SandyBridge/notice/">Official site English</a> , <a href="http://asusnb.ru/news/4203/">Russian site ASUS</a> .

    <h6>  Chapter 2 </h6>  Support. <br>  Like any paranoid user, I immediately checked on the <a href="http://vip.asus.com/eservice/changeSandybridge_NB.aspx%3Fslanguage%3Den-us">official website</a> whether my laptop has this potential error.  I drove the serial number in the box.  clicked on the button and: "Your product is affected by this issue." Contact support.  Compiled a letter and sent it through a form on the website and without becoming waiting for an answer, I phoned the support service in Ukraine.  The response received from a guy with an uncertain voice slightly surprised: ‚ÄúIn Ukraine, we do not provide the service of replacing motherboards with such laptops.  Do not worry, but even if you have this problem in the future, you will be replaced with the motherboard even after the warranty period has expired (thought came up to my mind: "... after all, the error will lie precisely in the loss of data that goes through SATA ..." ).  Sensing once again a resident of a banana republic began to accept his position.  29.04 But here comes the answer to my written appeal: <br><br>  " <i>Good afternoon.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Alexander, you can contact one of the authorized service centers. For contacting authorized service centers, you can follow the link:</i> <i><br></i>  <i><a href="http://event.asus.ua/support/%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">event.asus.ua/support/,</a> replacing the motherboard with a new one, with revision chipset B3.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Regards, ASUS Technical Support.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Please keep the correspondence in the body of the letter</i> . " <br><br>  A pause, a light stupor and an understanding of someone here is wrong, but certainly not me. <br><br>  I am writing the answer in English as the letter came in a clumsy encoding. <br><br>  " <i>Good day.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I have some questions.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I have called the Ukrainian ASUS Support.</i>  <i>I have recieved my motherboard of these laptops.</i>  <i>As I see there are some misunderstanding.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>There is no problem for any kind of client.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thank you for your time.</i>  " <br><br>  I am sending another letter to complains@asus.ua: <br><br>  " <i>Good afternoon.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I would really like to clarify the situation with laptop models that were equipped with potentially defective intel motherboards.</i>  <i>As far as I know, ASUS has produced several series of laptops with potentially defective motherboards.</i>  <i>On the official website of the company in the form of checking notebooks by serial numbers.</i>  <i>My laptop was on the list of those in which, according to data from the site, a potentially defective motherboard is installed.</i>  <i>When contacting support through a form on the ASUS website.</i>  <i>I received a response stating that I can contact the service center for a replacement motherboard.</i>  <i>But when I called the support service, I received a different answer: they explained to me that the service for replacing potentially defective motherboards in Ukraine is not provided.</i>  <i>I would like to know the official policy of ASUS regarding this issue on the territory of Ukraine</i> . " <br><br>  A couple of days later (04.05) I received an answer that was almost identical to the first letter: bring the service center to the service center. <br><br><h6>  Chapter 3 </h6>  Service-center. <br><br>  ASUS Service Center: <br>  - Good afternoon. I have a laptop for you under warranty for replacing the motherboard due to a potential chipset defect. <br>  - Hello ... - pause, comprehension - well, warranty card please. <br>  The girl has issued.  Out master: <br>  -So you have a laptop? <br>  - A laptop with a potentially defective chipset and on the recommendation from the ASUS official website, it is necessary to replace the motherboard with a new one with the revised chipset ‚ÄúB3‚Äù. <br>  The master is surprised, because I understand that he is hearing about it for the first time in his life :).  But they took the laptop from me and the master said that he would contact the managers and find out everything. <br><br>  Call in about a week (May 17): <br>  - Hello, this is from the ASUS service center about your laptop. <br>  - Good day. <br>  - I contacted the managers and they said that they do not recommend changing the motherboard if it works, since this problem may arise in the new motherboard and you will encounter it, although it was not in the old one.  You decide‚Ä¶ <br>  - Hmm ... - a light stupor, rustling convolutions and extracting information from your attic - I still don‚Äôt understand how this problem may arise in the new motherboard, because it will be on the new chipset that fixes errors.  That is what is said on the official website. <br>  - I unfortunately do not know anything.  but ASUS managers told me so. <br>  - Let me send you links to the official website and the form for checking laptops by serial numbers. <br><br>  The master gives the address of his mail and we say goodbye. <br><br>  I send him a reference and a little googling. I also send out the numbers of the B2 revision chipsets (revoked) and those that are issued in exchange, the revision B3: <br><br>  " <i>Good evening.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Corrected chipsets should arrive at the end of the arpel at the beginning of May.</i>  <i>So they have no right to send a motherboard with an old chipset.</i>  <i>Since according to their applications, the replacement is made on motherboards with a new revision chipset (B3).</i>  <i>If they refuse to supply a motherboard with a new revision chipset or do not recommend a replacement for some reason, I would like to receive an official letter from their head office in Ukraine.</i>  <i>Explain to them that I still do not understand their policies on the one hand, their statements to the press and on the official website on the other hand, their statements that arise during a direct contact with the support service.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I quote the marking of all the bug (B2) and corrected (B3) chipsets of the Cougar Point family:</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Z68: SLHAT (B2) -&gt; SLJ4F (B3)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>P67: SLH84 (B2) -&gt; SLJ4C (B3)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>H67: SLH82 (B2) -&gt; SLJ49 (B3)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Q67: SLH85 (B2) -&gt; SLJ4D (B3)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>Q65: SLH99 (B2) -&gt; SLJ4E (B3)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>B65: SLH98 (B2) -&gt; SLJ4A (B3)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>H61: SLH83 (B2) -&gt; SLJ4B (B3)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>HM67: SLH9C (B2) -&gt; SLJ4N (B3)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>QM67: SLH9B (B2) -&gt; SLJ4M (B3)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>UM67: SLH9U (B2) -&gt; SLJ4L (B3)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>QS67: SLHAG (B2) -&gt; SLJ4K (B3)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>HM65: SLH9D (B2) -&gt; SLJ4P (B3)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>From wikipedia ...</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>HM65 Cougar Point-M</i> <i><br></i>  <i>SLH9D (B2) (Recalled)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>SLJ4P (B3) (Fixed)</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>HM67 Cougar Point-M</i> <i><br></i>  <i>SLH9C (B2) (Recalled)</i> <i><br></i>  <i>SLJ4N (B3) (Fixed)</i> " <br><br>  Wizard Answer: <br>  " <i>Good evening!</i> <i><br></i>  <i>I redirected your letters to the head service Asus in Kiev, obtaining</i> <i><br></i>  <i>answers will inform you.</i>  ... " <br><br>  To be continued‚Ä¶ <br><br>  Continuation followed (09.06): <br><br>  "Good day! <br>  Your device has a motherboard ordered. <br>  Upon receipt you will be informed. <br>  All the best!" <br><br>  I hope to send with the correct chipset. <br><br>  PS Have you, dear habravchane, with such moments?  It is interesting to hear your story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119846/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119846/</a></p>
