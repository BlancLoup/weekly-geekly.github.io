    <blockquote>  sudo add-apt-repository ppa: keks9n / skypetab <br>  sudo apt-get update <br>  sudo apt-get install skypetab-ng </blockquote><br><br>  In the case of Debian, you will need to add ‚Äúdeb <a href="http://ppa.launchpad.net/keks9n/skypetab/ubuntu">http://ppa.launchpad.net/keks9n/skypetab/ubuntu</a> lucid main‚Äù to sources.list and import the repository key via apt-key adv - keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com - recv-keys 41A6E3C3. <br><br>  <b>Attention</b> : for reasons not yet established, on some 64-bit versions of distros (at least on Ubuntu 10.04), integration with the GTK theme is not loaded normally.  As a result, a drop happens when you open a conversation.  It is treated by installing another theme in the settings of Skype. <br><br>  <s>Tov.</s>  <s><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ignotus/" class="user_link">Ignotus</a> vowed to collect RPMs (for the previous version, they were the ones who did them), but according to him, the compiler on the Fedorov server when trying to digest SkypeTab crashes with Internal error.</s>  <s>I dropped the Mono-Vsky compiler three times with my code, the studio only once, when I wrote on VB6, it generally collapsed with unenviable regularity, now GCC has added to the collection.</s>  <s>No luck with compilers, in general.</s>  Everything was fine on my OBS. <br>  <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/keks-n:/skypetab-ng/Fedora_16/">Fedora</a> , <a href="http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/keks-n:/skypetab-ng/openSUSE_12.1/">openSUSE</a> <br><br><a name="rage"></a><br><h4>  Many letters about Unity and Canonical </h4><br><h5>  Introduction </h5><br>  In that funny moment when they started shoving Unity in the upcoming versions of Ubuntu, I had a completely working bundle from CairoDock and AWN (you can see it in the video from the link above), and I didn't understand why I need the same thing, but the braking , buggy and when falling, the compiz division is trailing behind itself into oblivion.  As a result, when updating, I had to spend 15 minutes trying to clean Unity from the system, and all the problems associated with it bypassed me.  SkypeTab has always been developed on this X11-compliant environment (Cairo-Dock even supports them better than the Xfce panel) and there were no special problems with its work.  Now I had to face such amusing entertainment as ‚Äúporting to Unity‚Äù.  I have not experienced any pleasant emotions at the same time. <br><br><h5>  Comparative analysis of the tray and indicate </h5><br>  Let's start from afar.  Not so long ago, I was one character <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ubuntu/133468/">here</a> , that the X11 standard tray is outdated and not needed, and the indicators are our everything.  Let's take a look at how notification areas work in X11 and in Unity. <br><br>  In order to add an icon to the standard tray you need to create a window, find the tray (about 2 lines of code) and kick it so that it sees this window.  After that, he embeds it into himself, you receive all the messages about the movement of the mouse, and on the icon itself you can even show the movie, at least through OpenGl to turn the 3D animation.  Simple, transparent, functional, working for many years. <br><br>  In Unity, there is a certain system called indicate, working via D-Bus (you can say "bye" to the icons in the notification area when entering via VNC under the same user).  Right click (I‚Äôm keeping silence about the mouse movement) there is no possibility to catch it, complex animations cannot be displayed either.  Progress is obvious.  NIH syndrome (Not Invented Here) in the terminal stage.  One of the advantages is the messaging menu made on it, which, in the absence of a multi-protocol messenger, is very useful in the household. <br><br><h5>  How canonical compatibility pipe shatal </h5><br>  Naturally, the developers for a long time (indicators appeared quite a long time ago) ignored them.  The canonicals were offended and they decided to disable the tray altogether, however, since the developers now began to ignore not only the indicators, but also incompatibility with Ubuntu as a whole (and they are right why the software should be rewritten if someone wanted to make their tray, and without preference and the poetess?), and putting my own patches on proprietary things like Skype is somewhat problematic, I had to invent a crutch in the form of a white list of applications for which the tray still was.  However, this crutch did not solve the problem.  All the same, because the tray was used.  Then someone just thought of a brilliant plan: let's make a patch on Qt, so that QSystemTrayIcon showed the icon not in the tray, but as an indicator, and we left-click to emulate it via an additional menu item.  It is said - done, and now the sought-after patches on Qt are ready and entered into the distribution kit.  Naturally, they did not enter the recently released Qt 4.8, and they also will not enter the upcoming Qt 4.9, since the Qt developers also don‚Äôt understand why there are crutches in their code due to the fact that they canonically have incompatible with anything built. <br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br>  Here I had to understand all this to understand why on Unity at me deployment from a tray broke.  Since it turned out that Skype now doesn‚Äôt have any icons on the tray, I had to stop intercepting QObject :: connect, which did not add to the stability of the work. <br><br>  I will say a little about the integration of SkypeTab with the messaging menu.  It is postponed for the simple reason that the D-Bus interfaces through which indicate, are documented a little less than nothing, and libindicate itself is packaged so that support for the Canonical <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MultiarchSpec">Multiarch</a> itself being <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/MultiarchSpec">promoted</a> is out of the question, because standards exist to violate them.  That is, normally on 64-bit systems in 32-bit code, this library cannot be used.  No  I, of course, think of something, and it will even work.  Around the release of 12.04.  For who knows what other ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù changes await us. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/134854/">https://habr.com/ru/post/134854/</a></p>
