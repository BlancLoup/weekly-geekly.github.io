And the most interesting of them, of course, are those relating to the activities of large charismatic companies representing the face of the entire industry.  On Wednesday, we saw two such reports at once, one from the master analysts for all (well, at least for many) hands from <a href="http://idc.com/">IDC</a> , and the other from professional technological prophets from <a href="http://gartner.com/">Gartner</a> . <br><br>  IDC pleased the market players with a remarkable <a href="http://idc.com/getdoc.jsp%3Bjsessionid%3DOUVDN5F1IRMA2CQJAFICFGAKBEAUMIWD%3FcontainerId%3DprUS20487606" title="Top 10 Predictions for Worldwide System Infrastructure Software, 2007">list of</a> predictions for the development of the system software industry.  Among the 10 points covering the most important, according to analysts, events that are likely to happen next year, there are things that must be very interesting ... for those who understand exactly what IDC meant.  For example, point 3 promises us that the mod on ‚ÄúUsing the para-virtualization of the Linux kernel will mostly squeeze, but will not fry.  Few will replace their current core with a para-virtualized core. ‚Äù  Sounds like something very important, right? <br><br>  But for the broad strata of society, the most interesting, perhaps, are paragraphs 9 and 10, since they concern almost everyone.  First, IDC believes that the anti-piracy measures Microsoft will take to protect its operating systems will have a strong counter-effect.  This campaign of manufacturers of Windows will cause outflow of users on Linux.  From our side, we add that the Novell-Microsoft transaction can only contribute to this.

      <br>
      The second thing that showed IDC glass ball (who knows what methods they do not use in their work!) About the fate of the Redmond corporation is that consumers will buy Vista (where they went), but not that with great enthusiasm ( they can be understood), while preferring the Premium versions of the OS distribution with minimal restrictions on functionality. <br><br>  Gartner, although it is the largest analytical company in the field of IT, made its predictions simpler and, as they say, in the forehead.  As many publications have reported in the last two days, she is quite sure that Vista will be the latest OS in the glorious dynasty of Windows, released in a single boxed version.  This is all completely understandable, without the use of words with the prefix "para-" and even more so without a single mention of Linux, which is not at all here.  Take it easy, penguin lovers. <br><br>  The fact is that modern software becomes modularized, which makes it much easier to improve certain functions of the program without having to reinstall heavyweight distributions.  The future operating system, according to Gartner, will consist entirely of such blocks-bricks, which, if necessary, can be replaced with new ones.  And it will happen automatically through the Internet.  How followers of Bill Gates can make a profit from this, Gartner does not tell, but let's not be too demanding of these people. <br><br>  In conclusion, I would like to note that December is probably the most favorite season of the year for IT journalists.  Hot press releases and reports are raining, topics for articles are more than enough, and then there will be New Year soon.  So, we will still please you and yourself with good materials. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4836/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4836/</a></p>
