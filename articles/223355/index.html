    <blockquote>  SQA Days is the most popular conference for QA specialists, to which the legs themselves carry to meet with colleagues again, listen to wonderful reports ... There are not enough words to describe, you just have to go.  Organization, as always, at the highest level.  It is difficult to compare the reports of previous conferences with this one, but, in my opinion, the level of reports has leveled off, plus the level of presentation of material has increased: ‚Äútypical presentation errors‚Äù that have been talked about before have become much less </blockquote>  - this is how <b>Andrei Ladutko,</b> one of the participants, describes his impressions of the conference (Full review: <a href="http://qastugama.blogspot.ru/2014/04/sqa-days-15-1st-day.html">http://qastugama.blogspot.ru</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/679/f52/a25/679f52a25a42585382925232f663d4fe.jpg"><br><br><h5>  SQA Days - a marathon of reports that change the testers' professional opinion for the better </h5><br><br>  According to the tradition that has developed over the years of the SQA Days, the conference was held in 3 streams: 2 session sessions (reports for 40 minutes) and 1 blitz.  At the same time, participants of the event received not just theoretical reasoning, but were able to understand specific cases and practices in various projects, which is especially important for the work of testers. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúIt is pleasant to note that the conference is developing.  It has more technical reports.  Their quality has also improved: the speakers understand that the case studies and methods of work are among the possible ones in the industry, and try to position them.  And this is a consequence of the work of the program committee, which not only selects reports, but also works with speakers on crystallization, identifying meanings.  At the same time, the conference does not go to an event for advanced testers, it justifies its motto ‚ÄúSQA Days - the point of growth of your career‚Äù ‚Äù </blockquote>  - notes in his recall Maxim Tsepkov.  (Full review: <a href="http://lib.custis.ru/SQAdays-15-mtsepkov">lib.custis.ru/SQAdays-15-mtsepkov</a> ) - <blockquote>  ‚ÄúFrom my point of view, the reports at the conference fully, representatively represent the range of applied processes and technologies in the industry.  And at the general, value level, and in practice.  And the authors understand that they show one of the options.  In addition, in some reports there is an attempt to understand why it happened that way. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/01a/90b/12d/01a90b12d95cca76718a84cde0241e2e.jpg"><br><br>  The participants of the conference especially noted a number of reports: <br><br>  - Dmitri Shtepura ‚ÄúCross-browser testing with popularization of HTML5 and CSS3.  Internet Explorer, not like everyone else for the brevity and capacity of the speech (conference winner); <br>  - Sergey Mikhalev "Dr. House's approach to testing query optimization" for extremely useful practical advice; <br>  - Alexey Lyanguzov ‚ÄúSuccessful tester.  The path of the professional "for the value of" self-realization "in the field of testing; <br>  - Igor Bondarenko ‚ÄúCrystal Agile, or how we adapted the development process to ensure maximum quality‚Äù for the fascinating story about the Agile process mutation during the adaptation to the project features. <br><br>  Video reports are available on the conference <a href="http://sqadays.com/ru/program/15080">program</a> page, reports continue to be laid out as soon as they are ready. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/06f/875/ade/06f875ade3240c60ab66b5a0e0817663.jpg"><br><br>  For beginners in the field of testing, the following presentations were especially useful: <br><br>  - Inna Smirnova ‚ÄúInvestigation of bugs: learning from Sherlock Holmes!‚Äù With a good presentation and structure of the report; <br>  - Catherine Zasukhina ‚ÄúAutomation for lazy testers.  Selenium + Python + Behave (BDD) ‚Äùwith tips on how to deploy a simple system for creating and maintaining autotests; <br>  - Sergey Ostapenkov "Quality Assurance: Practical Advice" is a step-by-step guide to the implementation of testing at all levels of the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fef/c4f/ebd/fefc4febdd8fb78fd87e7932d8d7a171.jpg"><br><br>  The SQA Days trump card was a report and the next 8-hour training of <b>Michael Bolton</b> - the experience of a foreign colleague aroused particular interest among the conference participants. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAt the SQA Days-15 conference in Moscow there were a lot of class speakers, but an invitation to the anniversary conference of Michael Bolton is a cherry on a tasty cake‚Äù </blockquote>  (http://qastugama.blogspot.com/2014/04/training-michael-bolton-critical-thinking.html). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aa7/6fd/2fc/aa76fd2fce14c188b5c0b4c729619406.jpg"><br><br>  The quality of the reports, their diversity and practical approach were noted by many conference participants, which we were very pleased with the organizers.  So, SQA Days is moving in the right direction and then it will only get better! <br><br>  For those who, for whatever reason, could not appear on SQA Days 15, even if you have to bite your elbows, but still it will help you to catch up on reports in part!  We also recommend viewing the presentation of speeches (also available on the conference <a href="http://sqadays.com/ru/program/15080">program</a> page). <br><br>  In the meantime, to get even more of the atmosphere of SQA Days-15, you can see photos from the conference: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.289845727846915.1073741831.247977782033710%26type%3D1">www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.289845727846915.1073741831.247977782033710&amp;type=1</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.289452361219585.1073741830.247977782033710%26type%3D3">www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.289452361219585.1073741830.247977782033710&amp;type=3</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/media/set/%3Fset%3Da.290536051111216.1073741832.247977782033710%26type%3D3">www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.290536051111216.1073741832.247977782033710&amp;type=3</a> <br><br>  And a little more flattering reviews <br><br>  We did not leave indifferent the participants of SQA Days and such components as the atmosphere at the conference and the technical equipment of the event: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúPersonally, I really liked SQA Days # 15: professional atmosphere, useful content of reports, excellent fan zone (especially loud virtual reality, which makes your knees shake)!‚Äù </blockquote>  - Natalya Savastyuk shared her impressions from the conference (Full review: <a href="http://natalia-savastiuk.blogspot.ru/2014/04/sqa-days-15.html">natalia-savastiuk.blogspot.ru/2014/04/sqa-days-15.html</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b33/438/c60/b33438c600985987733bf583d1e600b2.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/500/2ce/5ea/5002ce5ea04fd9c14b1b555f777fe4ac.jpg"><br><br>  For our part, as the organizers of SQA Days, we thank all the speakers and participants of the conference for their interest in the event.  We also got a lot of impressions and were inspired by new ideas for the future, so this is certainly not our last meeting - we will continue to improve the field of testing together! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/781/e57/d41/781e57d416b7ca34dd5a4b4e2ade44ca.jpg"><br><br>  And who besides testing is also interested in IT analytics, we are waiting for those at the conference business and system <a href="http://analystdays.com/ru/program/16339">analysts</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223355/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223355/</a></p>
