  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The greenest technopark in the world, or why start an IT business in India?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/924/e00/198/924e00198f9e4482ad5ebaf3bfa961b9.jpg"><br><br>  The WebCanape team has returned from the Indian <a href="http://technopark.org/">technology park Harmony at work</a> , which is located in Kerala and is considered the greenest world.  What I saw is impressive.  Approximately represent Skolkovo?  Not that Skolkovo, which is now, but what should have been - campuses, offices, university, apartments ... Now in Kerala 4 such complexes and a dozen smaller facilities are under construction at the same time.  Most of the work is already completed.  Optics are laid across the state to bring cheap high-speed Internet to any building.  3G is stable throughout the state and 4G is being commissioned.  And all this - against the backdrop of poverty, chaos and other features, the first time leading to confusion. <br><br>  The state government has allocated a huge amount of land and continues to allocate funds for the construction of infrastructure.  The scale is really impressive. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Why open a company in India? </h3><br>  The presentation was held by the manager of all state technoparks.  He is well aware that India is still far behind Russia in terms of developing its business infrastructure, but he understands even more that this is a matter of 3-5 years.  Before launching network businesses here, introducing automation, they are actively preparing the infrastructure and think what to do with tens to hundreds of thousands of small shops and shops that will not stand the competition.  By the way, in India, international delivery systems for goods (UPS, DHL, etc.) through post offices already work well.

There are no representatives of Russian business yet.  According to colleagues from the technopark, the main problem that can be solved by opening in India is the rapid build-up of the team.  Due to the fact that the standard of living in Kerala is higher than in other states, many Indians who want to get a good education or find a job flow here. <br><br>  To estimate the cost, the cost of an equipped open-space (plug and play) for 50 people will be approximately 2500 USD per month + electricity.  The base rates for outsourcing developers with 5 years of experience in PHP is about 3000 USD.  At the same time, they practice the scheme, when you first rent the developers, and then, if the project took off and it makes sense to open a full-fledged office, you can take the entire development team for a certain royalty.  Reasonably logical solution to the personnel issue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/489/17f/469/48917f469685462288c33067534b1865.jpg"><br>  <i>One of the technopark office facilities under construction.</i>  <i>Outside view</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/009/0b5/0a6/0090b50a612b4b5f82f98f2f673f00c5.jpg"><br>  <i>Open space, ready to go.</i>  <i>Inside view</i> <br><br>  The cost of outsourcing, in my opinion, is too high.  With such prices of Indian production, you cannot build a business for resale of resources (if we talk about Russia).  But go there at the time of project development, perhaps it makes sense.  Good infrastructure, international expertise, sea, sun.  :) <br><br>  Even more meaningful is the fast-growing Indian market.  Together with the infrastructure is growing and small business.  A population of 1 billion compared to 150 million in Russia makes it even more attractive.  Those who already know how to work effectively will be able to compete with local companies and take strong positions. <br><br>  I also liked the fact that the region has a clear development strategy and a clear goal.  The government of Kerala is clearly planning to become the IT center of India.  A clear and understandable positioning is something that the majority of our Russian regions lack so much. <br><br>  Thanks to colleagues from <a href="http://www.confianzit.com/">Confianz</a> for the excellent reception, excursion and detailed story. <br><br>  <b>As for WebCanape</b> , we are ready to consider investors' proposals for opening WebCanape India.  Placement - Cochin.  It is the financial capital of Kerala.  Near the city is the Technopark Infopark, belonging to the free economic zone. <br><br>  Vasily Churanov and <a href="http://www.web-canape.ru/">WebCanape team</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/245257/">https://habr.com/ru/post/245257/</a></p>
