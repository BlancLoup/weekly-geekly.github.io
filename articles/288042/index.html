It's great that all these three pleasures are available to our readers!  So let's move on to the next review! <br><br>  Sunday bytes tell us about this sweet <a href="http://sundaybytes.com/2006/03/07">alumni</a> word.  In general, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe whole article boils down to the question: ‚Äúwhy is the Harvard budget three billion dollars, and the budget of the whole Russian Academy of Sciences is only 1?‚Äù In reflection, the author finds the answer - we (because this also applies to Belarus) do not have this very alumni.  An adequate translation of this word into Russian is unknown to the author, but it means people who have been weaned at this university.  That is, abroad, they are happy to support their alma mater financially.  For example, a two-thirds Harvard budget consists of such investments.  Entertaining study.

      A blog about Internet marketing also raises questions - and he answers them.  Today you have to read the answer to the question: " <a href="http://web-blog.ru/2006/03/06/seo-time">search engine optimization is for a long time ... or not?</a> ".  Once, a long time ago, registration in directories, link exchange and page optimization provided very good results that persisted for quite a long time after the work.  But now directories and search engines are fighting hard against SEO.  So who will win? <br><br>  Sometimes cute people hide behind frightening names.  Here, for example, Maniacal Weblog for some reason does not write about dismemberment, but very much about <a href="http://softwaremaniacs.org/blog/2006/03/07/two-wikis">wiki</a> .  The author not only admires the technology itself (it allowed him to save a lot of time when writing documentation), but also compares two wiki engines.  So for those who want to use the wiki, but shy, the article will be a gentle push.  By the way, I once <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/169300.html">wrote about it</a> <br><br>  Kolesnik engaged in inventing fun.  Now his thoughts are exclusively on the <a href="http://www.kolesnik.ru/2006/noogenic">Noogenic machine</a> .  In fact, it is quite difficult for me to convey the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthis concept.  This is not something tangible, mechanical, but a certain principle of creativity.  For example, the alphabet is undoubtedly a noogenic machine.  In general, follow the link and read.  It will be interesting, especially to people of a creative warehouse. <br><br>  In her notebook, Anelka talks <a href="http://pixeblog.com/pixel/242">about Just work</a> .  This ‚Äújust work‚Äù was in a rehab center.  Let me quote: "Do you know what the salaries of the staff of the rehabilitation centers are? That's right - miserable. But do you know what kind of leave? That's right - at your own expense. But do you know what benefits for those who work with this social category? Right - no. And do you know what psychological, emotional, material, physical exertion and responsibility? That's right - unbearable. Therefore, the staff turnover is terrible. And I have gone. "  Now you can read as many as three stories about the work of Anelka in the rehabilitation center.  Perhaps there will be a sequel.  Vital and disgusting. <br><br>  I advise all gourmets to visit the <a href="http://mazoo.net/cook">Gluttony</a> blog.  I think you understood from the title that the blog is dedicated to the preparation of various dishes.  I highly recommend not reading it on an empty stomach, otherwise you will drown with saliva.  Solyanka, sloth, Christmas goose, pancakes, baked vegetables, cupcake - all this you can cook thanks to the blog "Gluttony."  Damn, you have to take money for advertising. <br><br>  ZOO magazine reflects on the unenviable fate of <a href="http://antiweblogger.blogspot.com/2006/03/blog-post_10.html">Russian startups</a> .  Everybody gets it - to website builders, to PR managers, and even to self-flagellation there is a place.  The text itself is remarkable - literary and with drops of bile, which I love very much.  So novice web entrepreneurs should be read to get rid of rose-colored glasses. <br><br>  Pavel Kupriyanov, in his Marginal Notes, <a href="http://kupriyanov.ru/2006/02/28/cwr-2006-07-piratam_vopreki">enjoys growing sales of</a> licensed software.  True, such joy occurs only in one firm, but, judging by the statistics presented, the total licensed bright tomorrow we are very close to you.  Perhaps really tomorrow. <br><br>  The blog New Business is telling <a href="http://getnew.biz/2006/03/02/six-apart-gotovit-novuyu-bloggerskuyu-platformu">about the spouses Trothta</a> - those who own the Six Apart company, developed the Movable Type platform and bought Livejournal.  The article as a whole is devoted to the new development of spouses - the Comet program and discussions about the future of blogs.  But after all, visitors to our forums already know this future - blogs will die in terrible agony just next week. <br><br>  A blog with a wonderful Dostoevsky title Idiot makes us happy with the article " <a href="http://idiot.ru/2006/03/13/ob-amerikanskoy-svobode-slova">On American Freedom of Speech, or how to write a passing article</a> ."  As it is fashionable now, goes to the American way of life.  More precisely, the legal component of this life.  Quote: "On an unspecified day last week, an employee of a federal agency, whose name could not be given, delivered a document that we could not name to a company whose name we could not disclose, with a request for information that could not be publicly discussed. " <br><br>  The blog with the dreamy title ZOOB shares with us the <a href="http://zoob.ru/2006/02/27/7-stadiy-chitatelya-rss">seven stages of the</a> RSS feed reader.  In-depth research on the topic and the likely impact of RSS helped the author to create an image of a person tormented by RSS, that is, you and me.  But in general, the article is humorous, so you should not take it seriously in any case. <br><br>  Software Review is fully consistent with its name and <a href="http://softreview.com.ua/2006/03/13/firefox-plugins-march">reviews plugin for Firefox</a> .  Review for March, the latest news, it is a pity that there are not very many plug-ins.  I love to hang myself a handful and wait about five minutes until Firefox loads. <br><br>  Pepsimist complains about the <a href="http://tabakerka.dk/pepsimist/archives/152">hard life of an owl</a> .  I think my readers are quick-witted and immediately realized that this is about people-owls who like to go to bed later.  Let's support a friend, I am also an ‚Äúowl‚Äù (this is a plus to the fact that I am a hamster) and early wake-ups are the most terrible for me.  Maybe cancel the morning at all? <br><br>  Bug Hunter's Blog takes care of testers and pampers them with the note ‚Äú <a href="http://bughunter.com.ua/%3Fp%3D85">Where can I get requirements, or how can a tester survive?</a> ‚Äù The article deals with the search for documentation, communication with the manager and developers of the project, with the customer.  So, everything that annoys the tester during the work. <br><br>  I invite everyone to participate in an interesting game that takes place every day in the <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/nosensemusic/">nosensemusic</a> community.  The point is to guess which song is spoken on by three tips.  If you guess with one hint, you get three points, and so on.  There are no goals, in principle, like prizes.  Only excitement music lovers. <br><br>  Well, if you are a fan of various puzzles, then you urgently need to community with the same name <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/zagadki/">zagadki</a> .  Anyone can publish their riddles and solve others.  He trains his mind and wit, recommended by leading nutritionists (I do not know why). <br><br>  A small note on the eternal theme of <a href="http://tanchik.livejournal.com/135374.html">male and female logic</a> .  I continue to say that we are from different planets. <br><br>  Wonderful <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shtuki/17292.html">advertising creative</a> publishes Good Jin in the shtuki community.  I would definitely buy such packages for myself, but I replaced some of the photos with ones that matched my mood.  Creativity to the masses! <br><br>  And the last link in our review is a funny little article " <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/76_82/1891179.html">How to become extravagant</a> ."  As always, quote: "Bring the speakers to work and connect them to the computer. Start some kind of pornographic toy with the appropriate sounds, and in response to the comments of colleagues with an impressive tone, ask them not to distract you from the work." <br><br>  Your personal aggregator <b>Alexey Kaletsky</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2006110602.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ11, 2006)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288042/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288042/</a></p>
