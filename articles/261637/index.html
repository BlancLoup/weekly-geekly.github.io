Not so long ago, we <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/google/blog/259983/">already</a> shared information about the startup program from Google, <a href="https://developers.google.com/startups/">Google Developers Launchpad</a> .  Now we would like to tell you more about the features and benefits of this program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8ca/e20/142/8cae201422b08f227f49c099f5df034d.png"><br><br>  Launchpad program is divided into two stages (or levels) - Start and Scale.  Participation in the Launchpad is free, and the program itself does not have any time limits, although we hope that you will be able to grow from a startup into a profitable campaign as quickly as possible (for someone it takes 1-2 years, and even 5 years is not enough, it all depends on what you do). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As we have said, the program itself has two different levels.  This is how they differ:

      <b><font color="#E64A19">Start level</font></b> <br>  This is the base stage, i.e.  focused on the newly created product or its prototype.  For example, if you have just written the first application and published it on Google Play, then this is the Start stage. <br><br>  <b><font color="#E64A19">Scale level</font></b> <br>  This is the scaling stage of a successful product or application.  The key criterion for getting help or moving to the Scale stage is your user base.  If we talk about applications on Google Play, we recommend focusing on downloads in the region of 50,000+.  At the moment we are helping about 30 Russian startups in the Scale stage, and your product may turn out to be one of the following.  Sign up on Launchpad and grow with Google Play and Google. <br><br><h1>  <font color="#2196F3">Benefits for startups at the Scale stage</font> </h1><br>  <b><font color="#E64A19">Design Review \ UX Application (Material Design)</font></b> <br>  This option is more suitable for applications, not games, since  The design of the application is checked for compliance with the principles of the Material Design concept.  A review can provide both a ready-made application (an apk file or a link to a published application on Google Play) or mockup.  Our recommendation is to focus on the first option, since  In most cases, mockup does not transmit animation elements, so get ready: you can be asked for a detailed description of the transitions, or make an express review and you will need to re-send the already finished application.  Read the <a href="https://materialdesignicons.com/">guidelines</a> , follow the set out recommendations immediately and save time and resources. <br><br>  <b><font color="#E64A19">Google Cloud Platform (GCP) - $ 100K resources</font></b> <br>  Google Cloud Platform cloud resources up to $ 100,000 are provided.  You can use them at your discretion, but one of the main requirements for providing access to GCP is intensive use of server or cloud resources.  By the way, you can use the resources of the Google Cloud Platform as a universal backend for applications on Google Play and in other sites. <br><br>  For example, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.aita">App in The Air</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.reactivstudios.android.dialer.free">Reactive Phone</a> have already received resources for the infrastructure of their applications. <br><br>  The latest topical GCP articles on our blog: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/google/blog/217209/">Google Cloud Platform Live: Mixing IaaS and PaaS.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/google/blog/217209/">Moore's Law for Clouds</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/google/blog/258237/">Moore's Law for Google Compute Engine: more power for the same money</a> . <br><br>  <b><font color="#E64A19">Firebase Resources</font></b> <br>  Firebase is a specialized service for mobile application backends.  Unlike GCP, where you can run virtual machines and independently install the necessary components / modules on them to maintain the server functionality of the application (Apache, MySQL, MongoBD, etc.), Firebase simplifies and abstracts the tasks of maintaining the server infrastructure, i.e. .  you are no longer involved in infrastructure administration tasks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/842/d12/1ea/842d121ea1f0103fbb48a13305bf2ad1.gif"><br><br>  By the way, in Android M, support for offline mode is associated with the built-in functionality of Firebase.  So Firebase is power.  :) In more detail about innovations in Android M it is possible to read in our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/google/blog/259123/">post on Habr√©</a> . <br><br>  <b><font color="#E64A19">UserTesting Resources (usability testing)</font></b> <br>  <a href="http://www.usertesting.com/">UserTesting</a> is a service for usability testing where real people perform the testing of the application, and you will be provided with a video report of everything that happens with the user. <br><br>  Program participants are given the <b>free</b> opportunity to conduct 10 full-tests and 5 mini-tests.  Usually the cost of one full test is $ 49. <br><br>  <b><font color="#E64A19">Google I / O and other Google events</font></b> <br>  Launchpad (Scale Stage) startups have the opportunity to get tickets for the annual Google I / O conference.  Part of the tickets is provided free of charge, and part of the tickets can be reserved for payment.  For example, one engineer from a team gets a free ticket, and a paid ticket can be reserved for a second engineer or team lead.  Startups from Russia this year already use this option and have visited Google I / O 2015! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0cf/591/475/0cf59147544b4255b6ea13da6570b649.png"><br><br>  In addition, we invite start-ups to participate in relevant events organized in Russia.  One of these events, held in May in the Moscow office of Google, was a seminar on Android TV.  At the seminar, such companies as Creative Mobile, Game Insight, Ivi.ru, Nekki, Playmous, Nival shared their experience in the adaptation of Android TV applications. <br><br>  Also in April, two accelerators of Launchpad Week were held in <a href="http://events.metabeta.ru/google-launchpad/">Moscow</a> with the support of MetaBeta and <a href="http://www.ingria-startup.ru/events_it/calendar/google_launchpad/">St. Petersburg</a> with the support of Ingria. <br><br>  <b><font color="#E64A19">Developer Support and 1: 1 consultations from Google experts</font></b> <br>  Developers can take advantage of Google‚Äôs free tech support.  Support is provided in English and is provided by email.  It covers the following technologies: Android and Google Play, Google Apps, Chromecast, Chrome Web Store, Google Glass and Google + / Google + Signin. <br><br>  In addition, you can get background information not only on technical issues.  For example, now we are conducting a beta program of consultations and an individual (1: 1) study of campaigns to promote applications through AdWords.  Google experts from Moscow and Dublin help to work out in detail and monitor the results of the promotion campaign throughout its duration. <br><br>  <b><font color="#E64A19">Early access to products</font></b> <br>  All participants of the Launchpad program receive an invitation to receive early access to Google products, as well as they have the opportunity to be among the first not only to try the product (for example, Android M), but also to leave a review. <br><br>  <b><font color="#E64A19">Local programs and initiatives</font></b> <br>  We closely and actively interact with all startups at the Scale stage, and also invite them to participate in various local initiatives.  For example, one such initiative is a <a href="http://apptractor.ru/StartupLaunch/index.html">series of podcasts</a> with members of Launchpad with AppTractor. <br><br>  In August and September, also wait for interesting acceleration programs for your applications on Google Play.  :) <br><br><h1>  <font color="#2196F3">How to apply?</font> </h1><br>  Please note that the so-called DevShops are not allowed to participate in the program, i.e.  companies that are not engaged in their own product, and customized development.  Such application will be rejected. <br><br>  All that is required to apply for participation in the Launchpad program is to fill in the <a href="http://bit.ly/1JvuvFm">form</a> .  Usually the answer comes within two weeks.  We are waiting for your applications! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/261637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/261637/</a></p>
