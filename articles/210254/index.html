Their disasters are very ‚Äúheap‚Äù at the end of January-beginning of February.  In the entire history of space exploration, five cosmic catastrophes occurred, twenty-one people died in them.  And the saddest thing about these disasters is that they could not have all of them.  None of them occurred due to the action of an irresistible external force, accident or the guilt of the crew. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  In order to avoid disputes about what a ‚Äúcosmic catastrophe‚Äù is, in this article I will understand the incident with the death of cosmonauts / astronauts, which occurred during the operation of space technology in space flight or in preparation for it.  There are five such incidents in history: Apollo 1, Soyuz 1, Soyuz 11, Challenger STS-51-L, Columbia STS-107. <br><br><h4>  Apollo 1 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/131/d8b/4f6/131d8b4f69c813caf3e9dbb5469c29ae.jpg"><br>  <i>From left to right: Ed White, Gus Grissom, Roger Chaffee</i> <br><br>  The lunar race between the USSR and the USA was in full swing.  The United States, thanks to its spy satellites, knew that a new large rocket was being built in the USSR, which could possibly bring Soviet cosmonauts to the moon.  Active flights of calm machines also did not add.  Therefore, the development of the ships "Apollo" was carried out in great haste.  The Apollo command module was made in two versions - Block I for testing in unmanned form and flights in Earth orbit, and Block II, which was to be finalized taking into account the comments on Block I, and would be suitable for flights to the Moon.  Two unmanned flights (AS-201 and AS-202) were successfully conducted in 1966, and the first manned mission was planned for the end of February 1967.  Began training crew.  The module arrived at the cosmodrome not fully ready, engineering changes were made by the hundreds already in the process of preparing for the flight at the cosmodrome.  On January 27, the first test was scheduled with a simulation of the work of the command module on-board power.  It consisted in verifying the operability of the ship‚Äôs instruments and starting at the moment of launch, but without real start-up.  The tanks on the service module were not filled, pyrotechnic devices were turned off, so the test was considered safe.  The test began at one o'clock.  It was difficult enough, there were many problems with communication, the readiness set was going very slowly.  At 18:31 a scream ‚ÄúFire in the cockpit!‚Äù Was heard over the intercom.  Fifteen seconds later, the module burst, unable to withstand the increase in pressure.  Astronauts Gus Grissom, Ed White and Roger Chaffee could not get out of the burning module and died. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c9b/eee/410/c9beee410f3bf0a5d0ace7181016473b.jpg">

    <h5>  Sequence of events </h5><br>  18:30:54: Voltage surges are recorded by telemetry. <br>  18:31:04: You hear the hey exclamation "Hey!" Chuffey and scrabbling sounds. <br>  18:31:06: White report: ‚ÄúFire in the cockpit!‚Äù On TV you can see the flame moving quickly from left to right, the smoke covers the TV screens. <br>  18: 31: 12: Creek, presumably, Chaffee: "We have a strong fire!" The sound of a bursting command module, cry: "I am burning!" <br>  18:31:21: Audio breaks. <br>  ~ 18: 36: Only at this moment the attendants were able to reach the module, break through the smoke and open the module hatches.  The module was filled with smoke, the fire as a whole stopped.  The bodies of Grissom and White were found at the hatch, the body of Chaffee was in the lodgment.  According to the instructions for emergency evacuation, he had to wait for the opening of the hatch and keep in touch.  An autopsy revealed that astronauts died from cardiac arrest caused by inhalation of carbon monoxide.  Body burns were posthumous. <br><br><h5>  Causes of disaster </h5><br>  The immediate cause of the accident was a spark or short circuit in the wiring.  The exact location of the spark is known only approximately, there are different versions, from the deterioration of the insulation on the wires (from the opening / closing of the technical hatch) to static electricity.  However, as in most technical systems, there were several factors that influenced the disaster: <br>  The main reason for the death of astronauts was the inability to quickly leave the command module.  The command module hatch consisted of two parts.  The upper part opened outward, lower - inward.  The increase in pressure from heating in case of fire made the opening of the inner hatch impossible.  The reason for choosing such an engineering solution is unequivocally unknown.  In the next version, Block II, the hatch was supposed to open to the outside; they wanted to do this in order to simplify the exit to the outside during extravehicular activity and at the end of the flight, the issue of emergency escape of the capsule was not considered.  The lack of emergency hatch reset systems was associated with fears of their unauthorized triggering, as happened in 1961 with Gus Grissom, who almost drowned after dropping the capsule due to spontaneous hatching of the hatch. <br>  The effect of the fire was influenced by the fact that there was an atmosphere of pure oxygen in the cabin at a pressure above atmospheric (16 psi or 1.1 atm).  In these conditions, even those materials were burned which, under normal conditions, are practically non-combustible.  Even aluminum burned.  How differently the materials burn in pure oxygen can be <a href="http://youtu.be/_JkHB1hV7Hw%3Ft%3D59s">seen here</a> .  NASA successfully used the atmosphere of pure oxygen on the previous ships - ‚ÄúMercury‚Äù and ‚ÄúGemini‚Äù, it allowed to save the weight of the structure and simplified the life support system.  The familiarity of such an atmosphere and the absence of specific problems led to the fact that it was no longer perceived by developers as dangerous.  On the contrary, in 1960, the tester almost died while testing a mixed oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. <br><br><h5>  Taken measures </h5><br>  In order to prevent the recurrence of a catastrophe, the following measures were taken: <br><ul><li>  The atmosphere in the cabin at the start was changed to 60% oxygen and 40% nitrogen. </li><li>  The hatch was replaced with an opening outward. </li><li>  All combustible materials were replaced with non-combustible.  Nylon was replaced by "Beta-fabric" of fiberglass. </li><li>  The wires were covered with non-flammable insulation (Teflon). </li><li>  1407 wiring problems were fixed. </li></ul><br><br><h5>  Effects </h5><br>  The Apollo program was delayed for twenty months to fix various problems.  After the improvements, the ships proved to be very reliable, a very serious accident on the Apollo 13 did not lead to human victims. <br><br><h4>  Soyuz-1 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9ca/d1a/cbb/9cad1acbbaa52cbefdd07cb426407002.jpg"><br><br>  April 23, 1967 was a difficult day for the staff of the MCC and the developers of the Soyuz ships.  The ambitious mission of the "Unions" -1 and -2 was thwarted.  According to the plan, the Soyuz-1 with Vladimir Komarov was launched first into orbit.  Then the Soyuz-2 was to be launched with cosmonauts Bykovsky, Eliseev, Khrunov.  The ships were to dock, and Yeliseyev and Khrunov were to go to the Soyuz-1 through open space.  However, immediately after the launch of Soyuz-1, serious problems arose: one of the solar panels did not open, the ionic orientation system was unstable, and the solar-star orientation sensor failed.  Asymmetrically opened solar panels shifted the center of mass, it did not work out a spin on the Sun to charge the batteries, there were problems with the operation of the orientation system.  The mission had to stop early.  With the return to Earth, problems also arose - the failure of the systems and the asymmetry of the center of mass did not allow us to orient the ship to braking.  MCC in an emergency order developed a new instruction on the orientation of the ship.  Komarov successfully guided the ship manually.  The braking impulse was issued correctly, the ship descended from orbit, the compartments were separated, and the descent vehicle was braked in dense layers of the atmosphere.  However, a crashed and burning descent vehicle was found at the landing site.  Cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov died. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba6/0a5/817/ba60a5817dad4b5599a63d6ef8ce23c4.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Sequence of events </h5><br>  At an altitude of 9.5 km, the hatch of the main parachute compartment was dropped, and a drag parachute was introduced, which was supposed to pull the main parachute out of the compartment.  However, he could not do this, the main parachute remained in the container.  At an altitude of 5.5 km, the reserve parachute automatics estimated the speed of descent as unacceptable and activated the reserve parachute.  However, it turned out to be shaded by a drag parachute and did not open.  With a speed of about 140 km / h, the Soyuz-1 hit the ground.  The concentrated hydrogen peroxide remaining in the tanks, which was used in the controlled descent system, caused a very strong fire that made the investigation difficult. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/OOXKsCzJyLQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiWPryberTeSVJaNr7uu0vE4TFkkA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Causes of disaster </h5><br>  The main cause of the accident was the failure of the main parachute.  The braking parachute did not have enough effort to pull the main parachute.  There are two possible reasons: <br><ol><li>  Violation of the manufacturing technology of the descent vehicle.  In the manufacturing process, the descent vehicle was placed in an autoclave to polymerize the resins of the heat-shielding layer.  However, due to the rush cap parachute containers were sent to the shop later, and they were autoclaved separately.  The hatches of parachutes were covered with something, but, apparently, they were loose, and the volatile fractions of the plastering fell on the walls of the parachute containers, making them rough, lumpy and sticky.  Increased friction made braking parachute effort insufficient. </li><li>  Error in the design - because of the rush "Union" never before the flight Komarov did not make a normal landing: the unmanned "Cosmos-133" was blown up during the descent because of the risk of landing not in the USSR, the ship 7K-OK ‚Ññ1 landed on the reserve the parachute due to the incorrect response of the emergency rescue system at the start, the Cosmos-140 was unsealed due to the bottom burnout.  During normal landing, the increased pressure in the descent vehicle squeezed the container and made the braking parachute effort insufficient. </li></ol><br>  The cause of the death of the astronaut was the failure of the reserve parachute.  Because of the aerodynamic shading of the canopy of the braking parachute, it could not be filled.  The investigation revealed that when testing the parachute system, such a failure was not checked. <br>  Ironically, the failure of the solar battery disclosure (caught on the screen-vacuum insulation), which disrupted the flight program, saved the lives of Bykovsky, Eliseev and Khrunov.  They had to fly on the same ship with the same fatal flaw. <br><br><h5>  Taken measures </h5><br>  The design of the main parachute container has been changed.  The container was made more rigid, its volume was increased, the shape was changed, and they began to be polished from the inside.  In the process of laying the parachute system, each operation began to take pictures. <br><br><h5>  Effects </h5><br>  The program "Union" was delayed for eighteen months.  Until the next manned flight, six developmental unmanned launches were made.  Problems with the parachute system no longer arose <br><br><h4>  Soyuz-11 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89e/a64/1bb/89ea641bb00c86f43da6e013bff82da2.jpg"><br>  <i>From left to right: Vladislav Volkov, Georgy Dobrovolsky and Victor Patsayev.</i> <br><br>  1971  The USSR lost the lunar race, but asymmetrically responded with the creation of orbital stations, where it was possible to stay for weeks, in the long run for months, and engage in science.  The first expedition to the first orbital station in the world came to an end.  The crew consisting of Georgy Dobrovolsky, Vladislav Volkov and Viktor Patsayev successfully worked in orbit for twenty-three days and prepared for landing.  The crew went to the Soyuz-11 and undocked from the station.  Braking and landing took place seemingly nominally, however, after the separation of the compartments, communication with the crew was lost.  The descent vehicle made a successful landing, but the crew was found without signs of life.  Resuscitation events were not crowned with success, astronauts died. <br><br><h5>  Sequence of events </h5><br>  At 01:47:28 MSK, at a height of 150 km, the separation of the ship‚Äôs compartments occurred.  At the same time, the vent valve spontaneously opened, which should only open at a height of 2-3 km.  The cabin began to fill with fog - the air vapor condensed due to pressure drop.  The whistle of the outgoing air was heard.  The astronauts turned off the radio equipment so that outside noise would not interfere with the search for a leak.  Most likely, they realized that the air leaves the vent valve.  Dobrovolsky (according to other data, Patsayev) undid the straps and, according to some sources, managed to close the valve, but not the one.  The fact is that there were two valves, and each had its own valve for manual opening / closing.  After about twenty seconds, the astronauts lost consciousness.  For 115 seconds, the pressure in the cabin dropped to 50 mm.  Hg  Art.  The astronauts died from choking. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/9eD4gK1WyxQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhzwogr6vxLXQzHiPtJh8TNCvNCqQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Causes of disaster </h5><br>  The immediate cause of the accident was the spontaneous opening of the vent valve at the time of separation of the compartments.  The compartments are separated by undermining the pyrobolts, and the process is accompanied by a rather serious shake-up.  The reason for the spontaneous opening of the valve is not reliably established.  There are several versions: <br><ul><li>  Violation of assembly technology.  On the Internet, without references, there is an account of a worker who allegedly missed the nut, and tells stories about nuts that are not completely tightened and falling out.  This, of course, is a rumor, there is no reliable information, but personally this version seems to me most likely.  The problem of quality is the scourge of any technically complex industry. </li><li>  Shock wave from pyrobolt triggering.  This was the version put forward by the commission of inquiry, but numerous experiments in the pressure chamber did not allow for a reliable reproduction of that effect. </li></ul><br>  The cause of the death of astronauts was depressurization.  Crash analysis also reveals design system errors: <br><ul><li>  When designing the Soyuz spacecraft, the principle was used: ‚ÄúAny single failure in any system should not lead to program non-fulfillment, any second failure should not lead to danger to crew life‚Äù.  However, in the case of the vent valve, this principle has been violated.  The crew did not have spacesuits, and one valve failure became fatal. </li><li>  Repeated requests over the past seven years, astronauts and representatives of the Air Force about the need for spacesuits were not heard by the developers.  The absence of depressurization cases was used by designers as an argument about the reliability of systems.  The forced exclusion of spacesuits on the Voskhod-1 spacecraft (otherwise, three astronauts could not fit in any way) was perceived as the norm, and the absence of spacesuits was originally laid on the Soyuz spacecraft. </li><li>  The need for ventilation valves and the logic of their work is questionable.  Valves were introduced for the case of a coup of the descent vehicle during landing, during which it is impossible to open the hatch.  They open automatically at an altitude of 2 km, however, in the case of landing on water, they can be closed manually.  The idea to make a valve that is manually opened if necessary without any automation for some reason did not occur to anyone. </li><li>  The controls were non-ergonomic.  In order to get to the valve control valves, it was necessary to unclip from the chair.  This took time and made it impossible to access the valves when overloaded. </li></ul><br>  The charges of the fallen astronauts that ‚Äúthe hole could be plugged with a finger‚Äù are groundless.  The valve was under the panel, direct access to it was impossible. <br><br><h5>  Taken measures </h5><br>  On the "Union" returned the spacesuits and put the device with oxygen for them.  It cost the third crew member, some time flew together, but the completion of the carrier rocket eventually allowed again to return to the crew of three.  Controls were reworked, they became more ergonomic. <br><br><h5>  Effects </h5><br>  The flight program was stopped for twenty-seven months.  Since then, the "Union" has operated for more than forty years and deservedly has a reputation as a very reliable machine. <br><br><h4>  Challenger STS-51-L </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/342/01e/3f9/34201e3f9fc9a7db963bd1f129f76942.jpg"><br>  <i>From left to right.</i>  <i>Top row: Al Onizuka, Krista Makoliff, Greg Jarvis, Judy Resnick.</i>  <i>Bottom row: Mike Smith, Dick Scobi, Ron McNair.</i> <br><br>  The period 1984-1986 was a real ‚Äúgolden age‚Äù for the Space Shuttle program.  The first flights on a jetpack, the first repair of a satellite in orbit, the first return of a broken satellite to Earth in the cargo hold, twenty-three satellites and one hundred forty-two tons of payload in two years!  In April 1985, the shuttles were launched at an interval of just seventeen days.  The Challenger mission STS-51-L should have broken this record, the launch was planned only sixteen days after the STS-61-C mission.  Shuttles were preparing for launch at both launch complexes at the same time, and the space center to them.  Kennedy was really like a science fiction spaceport.  The mission of the "Challenge" was somewhat unusual, as part of the crew was a school teacher.  Her task was to conduct a lesson from orbit.  The press and the public have lost interest in the NASA space program, and the ‚Äúteacher in space‚Äù program was supposed to revive it.  The idea failed - on January 28, 1986, the main TV channels showed only the first seconds of start-up and switched to the standard broadcasting schedule.  But after a few minutes they had to go on the air with special releases - ‚ÄúChallenger‚Äù was killed along with the crew. <br><br><h5>  Sequence of events </h5><br>  A small channel led the broadcast, and from the point of view of the viewer it looked like this: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/fSTrmJtHLFU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiZYCZRMKLMFIKf6MMF-Flr3lalwQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <abbr title="0.678 seconds from start">T + 0.678</abbr> : Black smoke is observed emerging from the right solid-fuel accelerator near the lower mount.

The resulting acceleration threw the lower tank up, hitting it on the top (oxygen) tank.  At the same time, the right accelerator, turning around the top mount, hit the external fuel tank.  The destruction of the external fuel tank, intensified by self-ignition of the spilled fuel components, began. <br>  T + 73.162: The destruction of the orbiter began. <br>  T + 75.237: The orbiter cabin has left a cloud of gases and debris.  Astronauts were alive and conscious.  It is known that three of the four personal air supply devices were turned on.  Some toggle switches were switched in the cockpit, suggesting attempts to return the electricity supply and regain control of the device. <br>  T + 240: The orbiter's cockpit hits the water at a speed of 330 km / h.  Astronauts are dying. <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/w6koilmpkZg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjLyYC0hOuj1GAmCjbgn6ttdkfIsg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Causes of disaster </h5><br>  The immediate cause of the accident is gas leakage through the connection of elements of a solid-fuel accelerator.  Problems with the tightness of the joints were known from the second flight of the Space Shuttle (the STS-51-L mission was the twenty-fifth flight).  After the first case, the engineers at Thiokol, which produced the side accelerators, carried out the following test: the sealing ring was intentionally damaged more than it did on the STS-2, then it was subjected to three times more pressure than the pressure in the chamber of the operating TTU.  The ring held pressure.  However, the test was incorrect.  Since 1984, out of eighteen missions, only three have had problems with sealing rings.  Worse, in nine of the fifteen problematic missions gas breakthrough was recorded through the O-rings.  The engineers understood the seriousness of the problem, but they lacked the resources to study and eliminate it in more detail.  NASA's brilliant visible success hid the disastrous overload of performers.  In the memoirs of the astronaut Mike Mullein, it is told about entire teams, processing for months without a single day off, workers who were pulled out of the house in the evening for an urgent call, and they worked even drunk.  The NASA document flow was overwhelmed by the requirements ‚ÄúI need people!  Spare parts!  Equipment! ‚Äù, Which remained unanswered, because there was nothing to acquire the required.  The economic calculation of the Space Shuttle program was dangerously erroneous, self-sustaining and did not smell, and the allocated money was not enough.  The situation was worsened by information distortions as it moved up the administrative ladder.  Managers unreasonably underestimated the likelihood of an accident on the grounds that the shuttles were manned and ignored the warnings coming to them from below.  In the evening before the start of Challenger, a conference of representatives from Thiokol and NASA was held.  Engineers felt that low temperatures could still worsen the tightness problem of the O-rings, and raised the issue of postponing the launch date to warmer weather.  But from NASA managers sounded in response: "God, Thiokol, where do you want to transfer the launch, to April?" <br>  The cause of the death of the astronauts was a blow to the water.  The cabin survived the destruction of the orbiter and fell entirely, still with living astronauts.  For some unknown reason, when developing the Space Shuttle program, no rescue system was created in the event of an accident during the first two minutes of flight (before the separation of solid-fuel boosters).  In the first flights, when the crew consisted of two people, ejection seats were installed, but after the shuttles were declared commissioned, the crew was increased to seven people, and two seats were removed.  In general, the Space Shuttle program was distinguished by some engineering overconfidence, which is worth the first flight immediately with the crew. <br><br><h5>  Taken measures </h5><br>  After the crash, the design of the side accelerators was changed.  A third sealing ring and components that increase the stiffness of the joint have been added.  A rescue system appeared on the shuttles, archaic and suitable only for emergency escape of the whole and controlled shuttle, which has nowhere to land.  Constructively, it reminded of the times of the Second World War - an ordinary parachute and a guide rod so that astronauts do not hit the orbiter wing. <br><br><h5>  Effects </h5><br>  The flights of the Space Shuttle program were suspended for thirty-two months.  The fifth orbiter, Endeavor, was built to replace the dead Challenger.  A series of space crashes with unmanned launch vehicles and an error in the design of the Hubble telescope were superimposed on the Challenger disaster, which together led to a serious crisis at NASA.  There were even opinions about the need to disband the agency. <br><br><h4>  Colombia STS-107 </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/821/8c0/b2b/8218c0b2be69c0c5d0ab4050c49d9ccc.jpg"><br>  <i>From left to right.</i>  <i>Top row: David Brown, Laurel Clark, Michael Anderson, Ilan Ramon.</i>  <i>Bottom row: Rick Husband, Kalpana Chawla, William McCool</i> <br><br>  2003  The crisis of the late 80s seems to be overcome.  Shuttles are no longer viewed as the only means of putting cargo into orbit.  Dashing flights on jetpack canceled as too dangerous.  But the Hubble was successfully repaired in orbit.  The construction of the ISS is in full swing.  Shuttle "Columbia" can not take part in this "construction of the century" - it was built first and too heavy for that.  Columbia flies with scientific missions, delivering the SpaceHub module to orbit and conducting various experiments.  Start January 16 was apparently successful.  It was noticed that a piece of thermal insulation fell off once again.  A rather routine mission in orbit was successful and came to an end.  The loss of data from the pressure sensors in the tires of the left wing was regarded as the usual minor problems that exist in each mission.  And even the loss of communication was not the cause of particularly serious concern.  MCC Houston was still trying to reconnect with the shuttle, when one of the employees saw on TV in the rest room a broadcast of a ship disintegrating in the atmosphere. <br><br><h5>  Sequence of events </h5><br>  January 16, 2003, 83 second flight.  A piece of insulating foam from an external fuel tank the size of a suitcase hit the left wing. <br>  February 1, 2003, 8:44:09 <abbr title="U.S. Eastern Standard Time">EST</abbr> , EI + 000: Conventional point of entry into the atmosphere, height 120 km. <br>  EI + 404: The ten-minute period of greatest heat loads begins.

The size and extent of the damage is not known, since none of the engineers were seriously concerned about this problem, and, despite the possibility of inspecting the damage using ground-based telescopes or spy satellites, this was not done.  The problem of blows with insulating foam was considered habitual and harmless.  Model experiments show a fairly large hole, which definitely doomed the orbiter to death: <br><iframe width="560" height="315"

frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The cause of the death of astronauts was the destruction of the orbiter at hypersonic speed.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the book by Mary Roach ‚ÄúThe Other Side of Astronautics‚Äù, quite deafly it is said about unusual damages of bodies due to the impact of a shock wave on hypersound. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There is no rescue system in such conditions at the current level of technology. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Could the crew of the Columbia have been saved? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Two scenarios were possible:</font></font><br><ol><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By chance the shuttle "Atlantis" was at a high level of readiness for launch. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù could wait in orbit until February 15, with enough reserves. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And "Atlantis" without passing the tests of the systems could be launched already on February 10. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There was a reserve in as many as five days to save people and, possibly, an orbiter!</font></font></li><li><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In case of impossibility of the first option, the crew could make a spacewalk to assess and attempt to repair the damage. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is a more dangerous option, the ‚ÄúColumbia‚Äù did not have a Canadarm manipulator, which is used when going into space, but the spacesuits were on each shuttle flight, just to be able to correct emergency situations. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We cannot confidently say that the orbiter could be repaired, but any attempt would be better than a sure death.</font></font></li></ol><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the findings of the commission investigating the Challenger disaster were ignored. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the case of "Colombia" was the same: there is a potentially dangerous phenomenon, which, however, repeats and does not lead to a catastrophe. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They get used to it, the measures taken, if any, are insufficient, and as a result a catastrophe does occur.</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Taken measures </font></font></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The problem of falling off pieces of insulating foam was solved only three years after the death of "Colombia". </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At this time, several shuttle flights took place, in which the foam continued to fall off. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only an X-ray of the tank being filled revealed the appearance of cracks, which led to the falling off of the pieces of foam. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And even in 2006, on the STS-121 mission, individual pieces of foam were still falling off. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the Shuttle missions, a special maneuver was added to the ISS: the shuttle hung from the ISS and rolled over. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The crew of the ISS at this time was photographing the tiles of thermal protection.</font></font><br><br><h5>  Effects </h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Shuttle flights were stopped for twenty-nine months. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, the Columbia disaster put an end to the Space Shuttle program. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">After this disaster, the shuttles completed only the absolutely necessary missions for assembling the ISS and those. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">service Hubble, and their flights were stopped.</font></font><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I added ‚Äúproject management‚Äù and ‚Äútesting‚Äù hubs, because I believe that the space industry is not so different from IT. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Chertok's ‚ÄúMissiles and People‚Äù are read as easily as the ‚ÄúTarget‚Äù by Elijah Goldratt, and it recognizes bugs, packs and deadlines in their ‚Äúcosmic‚Äù form. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I want people who died in space to die for good reason, and the bitter experience was used not only in the space program, but also in the field of IT.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Bitter cosmic disaster lessons </font></font></h4><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The familiar danger does not become safer.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The danger that we know well requires the same careful attention as an unusual one. </font></font><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Correcting one problem, think about not getting into the opposite.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Measures to eliminate one problem may lead to the risk of the opposite problem. </font></font><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If you require people to work faster, do not be surprised that they will break the technology secretly from you.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Hurry is a very large load on quality. </font></font><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The desire to have time can lead to a very large loss of time to eliminate the consequences of the disaster.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> This is a very serious argument to "hurry slowly." </font></font><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Laziness in risk management or the preparation of test cases can lead to very unpleasant losses.</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">A missed risk or a case can hurt very badly when operating the system. </font></font><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Thinking, very similar to ‚Äúthis is not a bug, this is a feature,‚Äù killed fourteen people in space. </font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">If the system does not behave as designed, but a catastrophe does not happen, it does not give any guarantee that a catastrophe will not happen later. </font></font><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Not learning from your mistakes means repeating them again and again. </font></font></b>
