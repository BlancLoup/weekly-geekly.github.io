  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About the effect of the comment of the first ... and last</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I have already noted several times that any discussion in social networks around a certain topic suddenly flares up, but also quickly goes out.  The discussion, however fascinating it would be, was usually not lively for more than a day.  Anyone who did not, for one reason or another, participate in it, is doomed to be, in general, not heard, no matter how interesting his comment will be.  All this I call the <strong>effect of the last comment</strong> .  How this effect is overcome, the subject of a separate conversation.  In the meantime, precisely because of the presence of such an effect, I want to repeat my ‚Äúlast comment‚Äù to the discussion that arose during the presentation of the collective blog ‚Äú <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/pure_content/20229.html">Intelligent Social Resources</a> ‚Äù <br><br><blockquote>  I thank everyone for a very lively presentation.  It is your comments and thoughts that made it so. <br><br>  Well, what, as the leader of a not so distant era said, ‚Äúgoals are defined, tasks are set.  For the work, comrades "- gentlemen!

      I hope that the dispute will indeed bring forth the truth, and together we will be able to develop a refined concept of growing up on the social web and the requirements for the corresponding resources.  As he said, but this time from very ancient ones, ‚Äúif not us, then who ?, if not now, then when?, If not so, how?‚Äù.  Who will implement these developments, the question is, of course, interesting :), but more on that later ... <br><br>  In the meantime, thank you all again!  I would be glad if mastak, Throwable, Labudomet, lazyant, bird2gt (sorry if you forgot to mention someone) will find time and based on their very interesting comments, write a note to our blog.  Then we will discuss them in more detail.  Otherwise, if everything is dumped in one pile, then we are unlikely to get a ‚Äúdry residue‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  <em>By the way, just for statistics, I wonder who among the participants in this discussion saw the comment above?</em> <br><br>  Returning to the effect of the last comment, or rather to the absence of any effect of it, if such a comment came after a <strong>period of "burning" the topic</strong> , it must be said that the discussion itself around a certain topic, if it is destined to flare up, will occur only if the first comment to This stimulates and will appear somewhere within an hour after the occurrence (posting) of this topic.  I call this the <strong>starting effect of the first comment</strong> . <br><br>  However, another comment is connected with the first comment, the most mysterious for me is the <strong>catalytic effect of the first comment</strong> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I do not know if you noticed that the tone and spirit of discussion of any topic is largely determined by the character, namely, the first comment.  A friendly comment is a relaxed business discussion.  Joking - the exchange of bikes begins.  Aggressive - ‚Äúon the blood‚Äù here, a herd of little evil little men runs here.  And what is interesting, intelligent specialists disappear somewhere.  Conversely, when there is an intelligent discussion, the little men from their holes, as a rule, are not shown.  In the best (worst?) Case will throw a few evil replicas.  You don‚Äôt even have to go far for examples - compare the style of the two discussions on habrahabr: the already mentioned ‚Äúpresentation‚Äù and the ill-fated ‚Äú <a href="http://www.habrahabr.ru/blog/pure_content/19673.html">burial</a> ‚Äù.  From the side it may even seem that such unequal manifestations occur in different resources.  In fact - not the same!  Why?  I have no answer yet ... <br><br>  <em>Yes, an interesting life takes place in the virtual world.</em>  <em>If I were a sociologist and a little bit younger :), I would definitely write a dissertation on this topic ‚ÄúResearch on stereotypes of human behavior in the context of different variants of the social structure of a virtual society‚Äù.</em>  <em>True, beautiful?</em>  <em>And the most important thing is very much scientific sound :)?</em>  <em>Like?</em>  <em>I am giving in ... I can even propose a <a href="http://www.itechbridge.com/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D26060">classification of the</a> types of social systems in social resources from the ocracratical to the technocratic.</em> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12086/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12086/</a></p>
