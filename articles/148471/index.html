  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Microsoft Office365: a classic in modern processing</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  If you refer to the requests of users on the Internet, for example, through <a href="https://www.google.ru/trends/explore">Google Trends</a> , you can see that the name ‚Äúword‚Äù significantly outperforms the ‚Äútext editor‚Äù in popularity.  Indeed, the names of office editors that make up the Microsoft Office suite have become nominal in their category.  Office suite Microsoft has always been ahead of its time and represented the best tools for working with the most thoughtful functionality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a68/582/585/a685825858b68a69e72b104d18ce79f0.jpg"><br><br>  At the moment, it has been transformed into an Office365 package, which incorporates all modern technologies: online and offline capabilities, access to cloud storage, the ability to use the most current versions, work from any devices, and so on. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="#9d0538">Office365 Business Benefits</font> </h2><br>  It is difficult to find a company that would not use office applications: reports, texts, TK in Word, quick notes in OneNote, extensive serious calculations, graphs and business plans in Excel, presentations and slideshows in PowerPoint, booklets in Publisher.  These are familiar and convenient tools that greatly facilitate everyday work.  Today, Office 365 has significantly expanded business opportunities, and now it is this package - a tool that can be not just a user application of each employee, but create a single workspace.

    <ul><li>  Full package of local Microsoft Office applications - all familiar tools are always at hand. </li><li>  Upgrading to current versions - any new functionality becomes available immediately to all users, the latest versions are always at hand. </li><li>  Ability to work from stationary workstations and mobile devices (running operating systems iOS, Android, Windows Phone) - you can work with documents from anywhere, files and data are synchronized on all devices. </li><li>  1 TB of OneDrive cloud storage per user ‚Äî in addition to documents, you can save photos and other files.  You can share folders or share individual files. </li><li>  The possibility of video shows and video conferences with colleagues and partners anywhere in the world.  In one meeting, you can collect up to 250 people, share documents, display screens, save notes on the current event. </li><li>  Convenient functional e-mail on your own domain name.  Contact management, archiving of messages, protection from spam, and a convenient administration system are available for mail. </li><li>  The ability to create shared calendars to monitor employee availability.  This significantly reduces the time for setting up meetings and general meetings. </li><li>  Synchronize email, calendar and contacts on all devices in real time. </li><li>  Security and privacy of user data. </li></ul><br>  Obviously, the Office365 package not only provides a set of editors, but also solves a number of important corporate issues that require additional office software.  If you have Office365, you don‚Äôt need to worry about sending to clients, archiving and ordering in business correspondence, document repository, sending large files and even managing tasks and staff time. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#9d0538">Why exactly Office365 business?</font> </h2><br>  Those familiar with Microsoft's Office know that there are several options for acquiring it - for any needs: Office 2013 for home and business, Office 2013 standard and, in fact, Office365 business itself.  However, not everyone knows how these packages differ and which one is more profitable to buy.  We will try to clarify. <br><br>  <b>Office 2013 Home and Business</b> is a boxed solution; it is installed only on one device (PC or laptop), is not installed on iPad and mobile devices, does not provide cloud storage of 1 TB.  In addition, you must independently monitor the relevance of installed versions.  The boxed solution is purchased at a time and requires substantial initial costs.  In addition, this package does not include the Publisher editor, a handy publishing application in which you can create many necessary things: flyers, booklets, envelopes, letterheads, email templates. <br><br>  The main drawback of the <b>Office 2013 standard</b> is the high purchase price, the costs are paid off only after 4 years.  Similar to the previous package, installation is possible only on the desktop: 1 PC and 1 laptop, 1 TB of storage is not provided.  Unlike the previous solution, synchronization with Active Directory and work in terminal mode are provided. <br><br>  <b>Office365 is</b> paid discretely, in small monthly installments - it‚Äôs as simple and convenient as paying for the Internet or mobile phone.  The total cost of ownership during the year is lower than the cost of holding any of the other two packages.  In this case, you get the maximum of the above advantages, including synchronization with Active Directory and work in terminal mode. <br><br>  Today the market offers many solutions similar to MS Office and Office365 in particular.  However, for business and business communication purposes, Microsoft firmly holds the leadership position, primarily due to the unique capabilities of editors and mail.  Even with a quick glance, the user can appreciate the undeniably important and necessary advantages of applications.  Consider some of them. <br><br><ul><li>  Excel pivot tables are an indispensable analytical tool for processing data arrays.  Suppose you have 300 sales of different items of goods per month - at the end of the period a sheet of numbers was formed, you need to create a quick analytics, group the data.  Pivot tables in MS Excel - an indispensable tool. <br></li><li>  Anyone who has worked with complex business calculations and created consolidated business plans will hardly ever refuse Excel for operational work - the editor is ideal for working with formulas, sorting, consolidation of sheets, references to sheets, and so on.  complex calculations. <br></li><li>  Paperwork (reports, business plans, consolidated documents, diplomas and theses) requiring compliance with the requirements of GOST can be done quickly and simply only in MS Word - other editors will require incredible efforts to comply with all standards. </li><li>  A huge advantage was the ability to customize the functionality of editors using the API and the SDK - now a business can create its own add-ons that will serve to optimize work in the company.  Basically, the SDK turned Office365 into a developer platform for Windows, Android, Web, iOS.  This is not a continuation of Access and VBA capabilities - it is a powerful solution that allows you to create your applications within applications and significantly change the appearance of the corporate system. </li></ul><br>  Thus, choosing Office365, a business (and a private user) gets the maximum convenience, the always up-to-date version of the application office suite, flexible scaling and licensing, and access to its documents from virtually any mobile and stationary device. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#9d0538">Personal data will be written in Russia</font> </h2><br>  As you know, the State Duma transferred the entry into force of the law that the personal data of Russians should be stored on servers in Russia, on September 1, 2015.  That is, up to hour X less than two months left.  The federal law refers a large amount of information to personal data of citizens, including telephone subscriber numbers, email addresses and much more, and ‚Äúthe operator is obliged to ensure the recording, systematization, accumulation, storage, update / update, change / extraction of personal data of citizens Russia using databases located on the territory of Russia ".  That is, in fact, the new law affects users of cloud services (mail, hosting), social networks, online stores, etc. <br><br>  Accordingly, Office365 users are subject to this norm.  However, all fears are in vain - Microsoft provides the deployment of Office365 in the Russian cloud with the help of partners, one of which is Softline.  Softline's virtual infrastructure provides in addition to the absence of costs for the implementation, maintenance and administration of equipment, efficient use of resources, quick start-up and continuous infrastructure upgrades.  In general, everything that small and medium businesses need for active and safe work. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#9d0538">Softline is ready for any challenges.</font> </h2><br>  Softline presents the first international-class cloud services as part of the Cloud OS Network Russia initiative.
