  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to pump your career through GitHub</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>GitHub is the largest library created by developers for developers.</b>  <b>The main charm of hosting in its ideology: to give as easy as getting.</b>  <b>Here you can find a variety of IT-projects as legal, and not quite.</b>  <b>Using openness, someone rummages in the source code for personal gain - in order to use their vulnerabilities for banal blackmail, and someone with the help of repositories pumps their professional skills.</b>  <b>Let's see how not to dig in millions of sources and what perks you can get.</b> <br><br>  The fact that knowledge does not belong only to a narrow circle of the elect is already recognized by transnational corporations.  On the basis of one source code, several new ones grow - and the technologies that the whole world begins to use are developed.  Giants such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Microsoft - have posted and continue to constantly update their repositories on GitHub.  But what if even the US Department of Defense gets storage on the hosting <a href="">https://github.com/Code-dot-mil/code.mil</a> with the slogan "Help us become better."  And each new proposed useful solution is another learned lesson in the career of a developer. <br><br>  The format of open-source projects is good because it allows participants to communicate in the same way as we do in social networks.  Remember the principle of competition!  For example, someone posts an implementation of the idea.  Other participants, on interest, or wanting to admire offer hacks.  In the end - the community is a plus to the authors of the best solutions.

      Therefore, in order to practice and test your abilities, periodically it is worth throwing pull requests - suggestions for code changes - to the developer who has opened the repository you like.  The owner, in turn, can both reject and accept the request.  This will be an assessment of the work performed.  Plus - in this way it can be understood whether the project needs to be improved. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  In November 2018, GitHub reported that the <a href="https://blog.github.com/2018-11-08-100M-repos/">number of created repositories on the hosting exceeded 100 million</a> .  In order not to get confused in this diversity and learn how to find the necessary information, first of all accurately formulate the query in the search bar.  For example, wanting to know how to make the system be more independent in developing solutions, and write: ‚Äúmachine learning‚Äù. <br><br>  Digging into the repositories is definitely worth it.  At least in order to keep abreast of the latest trends and understand why those, or other libraries, or approaches are becoming popular.  It is clear that each specialization is a separate Klondike of knowledge.  But there are sections that are worth paying attention to each developer.  Now in the top of the front-end and back-end JavaScript, creating software for machine learning and mobile applications.  Among the best open-source projects are those with the largest number of developers, which makes life easier for the programmer by editing code, automation, containerization or documentation.  Among them are Visual Studio Code (19 thousand contributors), React Native (10 thousand) and TensorFlow (9.3 thousand). <br><br>  On GitHub you can find interesting, or rather to say - beautiful - implementations of cryptographic solutions.  In addition, hosting helps to understand how to work with Solidity - user manuals and <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/%255BRussian%255D-%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE-Solidity">detailed documentation of this language is also available in Russian</a> .  Plus - it was useful to get acquainted with examples of smart contracts in order to understand how this looks in practice.  Having ‚Äúwatched‚Äù something from colleagues, and, having been inspired by several projects, your brain will probably be able to give birth to its own original idea. <br><br>  <b>HackerU school teachers selected the source code, the study of which will positively affect your karma:</b> <br>  <a href="https://github.com/infoslack/awesome-web-hacking">https://github.com/infoslack/awesome-web-hacking</a> - This repository is intended for those who want to understand web security, but do not know where to start.  Here you will find not only links to documentation, labs and books on the topic, but also a worthy set of tools: application audit methodology, pentesters and vulnerability scanners.  The material will introduce you to common types of attacks on web systems, such as XSS, SQL injections, DNS spoofing. <br><br>  <a href="">https://github.com/FabioBaroni/awesome-exploit-development/blob/master/README.md</a> - Library for the development of exploits.  The collected resources contain analysis of binary vulnerabilities, as well as tips on how to find weak spots in the software and make the code more secure.  For example, to avoid a terrible dream for each programmer - buffer overflow.  An indispensable material for security professionals.  After all, to build an impregnable wall, you need to know what kind of loopholes the attackers used before. <br><br>  <a href="https://github.com/nebgnahz/awesome-iot-hacks">https://github.com/nebgnahz/awesome-iot-hacks</a> - In fact, this is a collection of hacks about everything that falls under the definition of ‚ÄúInternet of things‚Äù.  Stories about how you can easily crack almost everything in the modern world: from a wrist bracelet and a portable speaker, to a car and a ‚Äúsmart home‚Äù.  Here you will find descriptions of bluetooth-attacks that have become widespread just because of the increased popularity of wearable IoT devices.  By the way, note the fans of these gadgets - with their help, hackers can collect a good dossier on the owners.  The authors of the repository hope that it will serve as a boon, and equipment manufacturers, having familiarized themselves with the material, will begin to eliminate vulnerabilities. <br><br>  <a href="https://github.com/sobolevn/awesome-cryptography">https://github.com/sobolevn/awesome-cryptography</a> - Selection of resources for working with cryptography and organization of applications.  Indispensable for those who constantly work with different programming languages.  Blogs, studies, guidelines and instructions will tell you how to correctly build access to your own resources and teach the art of writing the original encryption logic in projects.  It will be useful to bookmark and review, even if it is not quite your specialty.  Knowledge of the basics of cryptography will not be superfluous for anyone. <br><br>  By the way, traveling through the repositories in GitHub will be interesting and exciting not only for ‚Äúfans‚Äù and beginners.  It is known that children learn new information better in a playful way.  I think that developers are no exception.  Proof of this - this quest to learn <a href="https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/">JavaScript - https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/</a> - made in a video game format. <br><br>  <b>The profile and developer activity on GitHub today has become the most visible summary.</b>  And in 90 percent of cases, potential employers will look at your stars and the number of followers on the hosting.  There were cases when programmers were denied participation in the hackathon because of a blank page on GitHub. <br><br>  But do not regard this server as a sacred cow.  After Microsoft bought the service in July, tens of thousands of particularly superstitious developers transferred projects to other hosting sites: GitLab, BitBucket, SourceForge, and others. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/432180/">https://habr.com/ru/post/432180/</a></p>
