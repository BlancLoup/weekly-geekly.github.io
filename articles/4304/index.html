  <section class="page js-page"><h1>AllofMP3.com expands business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Rumors about the imminent death of AllofMP3.com were exaggerated.  The legend of Russian piracy not only continues to work, but even expands the business: it advertises special software for downloading files and distributes bonuses to customers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  As you know, on September 1, 2006, <a href="http://www.law.copyright.ru/lawprojects-1588.html">amendments</a> to the law ‚ÄúOn Copyright and Related Rights‚Äù come into force in Russia, according to which phonogram producers receive a new ‚Äúright to be made public‚Äù.  In connection with this, a number of provisions of the law change.  For example, art.  39 p. 3 is now set forth as follows: <br><br>  <i>3. Prior to the use of phonograms, an agreement is concluded between the phonogram user or associations (associations) of such users and organizations that manage the rights of phonogram producers and performers on a collective basis, which determines the amount of remuneration and the conditions for its payment.</i> <br><br>  Thus, from September 1, 2006, online stores seem to be deprived of the right to distribute musical works without prior conclusion of direct agreements with copyright holders.  And of course, they don‚Äôt and never will have such agreements, because most rightholders never agree to sell their music for such a ridiculous price.

      In connection with the approaching ‚Äúblack day‚Äù and the possible closure, many Russian mp3-shops staged grand ‚Äúsales‚Äù of music.  The flagship of Russian piracy, the site <a href="http://allofmp3.com/">AllofMP3.com</a> , hit the epicenter of this <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/article/32/">international scandal</a> .  In early June 2006, officials from the US Trade Representation announced that the issue of musical piracy on the Russian Internet could be a matter of principle for Russia's admission to the World Trade Association.  According to overseas lawyers, last year, Russian pirates caused damage to the US economy in the amount of about $ 1.8 billion. Americans were especially outraged by the online music store AllofMP3.com: "This is absolutely unprecedented case when a pirate site has been working so openly for a long time, ‚Äùsaid Neil Turkewitz, executive vice president of the RIAA Association, which represents the interests of the recording industry. <br><br>  It soon became known that AllofMP3.com business owners will be <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/lenta/227/">judged in the UK</a> .  After that, the site AllofMP3.com went offline.  It seemed that on this his story came to an end.  But no.  The problem was simply a huge number of visitors from all over the world who flooded into the Russian store, having learned about it from the news feed.  After some time, the site returned to online, now it feels great and looks 100% ready for September 1. <br><br>  Moreover, the site is expanding its business.  In particular, at the bottom of the main page there was a link to the partner resource <a href="http://alltunes.com/">AllTunes</a> , through which a special program is distributed to access the AllofMP3.com music collection.  Judging by the <a href="http://alltunes.com/screenshots.shtml">screenshots</a> , the program is an almost complete analogue of Apple iTunes, but it works not only on PCs, but also on smartphones of various models (under Symbian OS or Windows Mobile 2003/2005).  As <a href="http://rus.delfi.lv/news/technology/internet/article.php%3Fid%3D14622513%26amp%3Bcom%3D1">experienced ‚Äúfreeloaders‚Äù say</a> , through this program you can download an unlimited amount of music for free, because when you register each email address, you receive a bonus of 20 cents. <br><br>  Perhaps the program AllTunes is preparing as a spare airfield, where you can sell music on the Internet, if you have problems with the main site.  But another version looks more believable.  The business of AllofMP3.com continues to grow steadily, and Russian merchant pirates are not at all afraid of the upcoming legislative amendments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4304/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4304/</a></p>
