      Remember these words of Tyler Derdon from the movie "Fight Club"? <br><br>  I have on Twitter a list called ‚Äúhumor,‚Äù which contains entertainment channels with jokes and jokes.  I sometimes get distracted and read them to raise my spirits.  But the more you write, the more you analyze what you read.  I began to understand where the girls come from, wanting to be cocky and the guys choosing alcohol. <br><br>  I will not be unsubstantiated.  The accounts, the jokes of which I will bring, read millions.  Read and think what message the following notes carry: <br><br><blockquote>  "The most good morning - got up, washed, drank coffee and went home" <br>  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand what is good in the description of a man:‚Äú I don‚Äôt drink, I don‚Äôt smoke ‚Äù.  Neither drink with him, nor smoke. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúI want my mother to put on a jacket with a hat on me and take me to the kindergarten, but I don‚Äôt want to go to work‚Äù <br><br>  "one.  Tell everyone you don't drink <br>  2. Thump like hell " <br><br>  ‚ÄúGive me a vaccine against mud * cove‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúNot an alcoholic, but a taster‚Äù <br><br>  ‚Äú- Describe your attitude to alcohol in one word. <br>  - I will" </blockquote><br><br>  Jokes are fun to read and, following the imposed lifestyle, it seems that life is more fun.  Is it so?  Probably - yes, because the less you think, the easier it is to live.  Such people live in the present, worry about the past and fear the future.  That's not bad.  I am not going to blame or insult anyone, because many of these people are good friends who are ready to help and support.  What about you?  Are you mediocre?  I do not know, but in any case, you are on the right track. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI know why you are here.  I know that you are oppressed.  Why are you not sleeping, why do you live alone, and do not turn off the computer all night long?  You are looking for him.  I know, because I was looking for myself.  He found me.  And he explained that I was not looking for him at all.  What I am looking for an answer.  We are not bothered by the question, Neo.  He brought you here.  You ask him, as I did. ‚Äù <br></blockquote><br>  I was also looking for an answer.  For hours I could wander the streets and think.  I tried to find something, but could not ask a question.  It is depressing when something inside is wrong.  When you begin to understand that the old world is crumbling, but you have not had time to build a new one.  But this moment has to happen, and then a new life begins, in which there are no imposed opinions and authorities.  Opinion is what appears inside. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI do not share any opinions: I have my own‚Äù - I. S. Turgenev.  "Fathers and Sons" </blockquote><br><br>  It is at this moment that the originality appears.  She breaks the shackles and opens up a world full of desires and wildest dreams.  You just have to choose one goal that will make you happy and pursue it with all your might. <br><br><blockquote>  "I do not dream, I set goals and achieve them" - Harvey Spectrum </blockquote><br>  How to become extraordinary? <br><br>  No  You are already special, just discard all the nonsense that people tend to convince themselves of, and start doing something worthwhile. <br><br>  What exactly?  I dont know.  The choice is always yours.  Exploring my life, I noticed that before directing all the forces in one direction, the turning point came when I was clearly aware of the right choice. <br><br>  It could be a book, casual acquaintance at a conference, or just an obsessive thought that throws off all doubts.  So it was in my case.  It is possible that such moments occurred in your life when you felt that the chance had come.  Maybe for some reason you missed it, but everything that happened did not matter.  What matters is what you are going to do next.  You must have heard that a person becomes what he plans to become.  So what are you planning now? <br><br>  Many have accepted success as a cult and do not recognize that only perseverance helps to get to a new level.  It is easier for many to convince themselves of this than to try to change.  After all, you can change only by work.  And this is not easy.  Not easy to wake up and go to the gym.  Do not just work while others walk.  It is not easy to be different.  It's damn hard, but it is this trait that distinguishes successful people. <br><br>  It is not so important for me whether you believe me or not.  Start doing something or stay in the same place.  Always the choice is yours.  But, despite the share of selfishness, I write again and again, because I see around people whose values ‚Äã‚Äãdo not correspond to reality and are not capable of making them happy.  I try to help my peers believe in another life that is not limited to pixels, kilometers, or inches.  Believe in a life that is limited only by your goals. <br><br>  I have not achieved everything that I wanted.  It should be so.  Each achievement generates the following.  Each goal is a step, not a pedestal.  You need to set yourself up for a long journey in which there will be falls and rises, and it depends only on you whether you will reach the end. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299578/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299578/</a></p>
