    <h3>  1. ‚ÄúShipping greatness‚Äù by Chris Vander Mey </h3><br>  One of the best books with a small set of platitudes for beginners.  If you are just starting your way as a product or project, or you want to check with the truths, then you need it.  The whole process of product launch on the market from idea to implementation based on real experience, and not ‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù <br><br><h3>  2. "Crossing the chasm" / "Bridging the Abyss" by Jeffrey Moore </h3><br>  Moore believes that there is a gap between pragmatism and technological romanticism.  Simply put, in order to release you need to be both a romantic from the IT world and a pragmatist from the real market.  How to combine all the features and make the product viable and monetized.  What you need for proper positioning and segmentation.  In general, a cool book for those who understand that the product should also bring profit. <br><br><h3>  3. "Inspired" Marty Cagan </h3><br>  The book is an inspiration, because it lays out on the shelves everything that happens with the product manager, that he should be able to know who to be and what skills to possess.  What product capabilities are really important, but what can you sometimes ‚Äúscore‚Äù.  And most importantly, what should be done to make your project people really fall in love, and not forgotten and thrown into the dustbin. <br><br><h3>  4. ‚ÄúMental hospital in the hands of patients‚Äù Alan Cooper </h3><br>  If you think that this is about fiction, then you are deeply mistaken.  This book is about what should go before the code design.  Do not rule patients in a mental hospital, and doctors.  And if the code is the first, then we are waiting for trouble.  Design should also be correct, and the book tells about what is the most "correct" to help rectify the situation. <br><br><h3>  5. ‚ÄúCommunicate with the child.  How? ‚ÄùJulia Gippenreiter </h3><br>  This book is not only about children and for parents.  We all once were children, in order to properly communicate with colleagues, investors and partners, we must understand how to do this so as not to offend the inner child and understand why this or that style of communication can lead to disaster.  Useful if networking is important to your work. <br><br><h2>  Five books of Mikhail Karpov - product manager on VK </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e1/09/59e10972e80f7620705597.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  1. "Contagious" Yona Berger </h3><br>  Why do some products soar, while others do not?  Why are we talking about some a lot, while others bypass us?  Where does this phenomenon of ‚Äúword of mouth‚Äù come from and how to use it for yourself in the product history.  This is what the "contagious" says. <br><br><h3>  2. "About the interface" Alan Cooper </h3><br>  Once this book was revolutionary, in its first edition.  The whole idea was to design products based on people's goals, and not ‚Äúbecause because‚Äù.  In addition, the entire book is practical through and through: each principle of interaction design is sorted out in detail.  This is the value. <br><br><h3>  3. "Hooked" / "Buyer on the hook" Nir Eyal </h3><br>  How can a product form the habit of using it?  How to understand if the user will like our idea?  What tools will help you to succeed, using the example of Pinter, Twitter and Instagram?  This book tells the available, understandable and useful that such consumer behavior and how to use it. <br><br><h3>  4. "Inspired" Marty Cagan </h3><br>  We have already described this book above, so why repeat? <br><br><h3>  5. ‚ÄúLean Analytics‚Äù Alistair Croll </h3><br>  Product analytics?  No, have not heard.  An excellent book for those who want to begin to understand what, where and why, why.  Analytics helps to understand how to make the product better, more efficient and monetized.  Without confirmation by numbers - most often the idea is doomed to failure. <br><br><h2>  Five Books by Ivan Zamesin - Product Manager at Chatfuel </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e1/09/59e109864cf5f726428121.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  1. ‚ÄúScrum‚Äù Jeff Sutherland </h3><br>  How can you do everything according to Scrum, but not read the books of its founder?  You can of course, but why?  Jeff invented his system, struggling with the problems of classical product management.  And now, when everyone switched to the Agile system, and exactly to Scrum or Kanban, you should understand why and why it was done, and where the deep meaning and benefits for the product.  This is just a must-read. <br><br><h3>  2. "Inspired" Marty Cagan </h3><br>  I reread it many times and it was from studying this book that I began to develop as a product manager. <br><br><h3>  3. "The Mom Test" / "Ask Mom" ‚Äã‚Äãby Rob Fitzpatrick </h3><br>  Very rare book on the combination of simplicity, value of knowledge and applicability.  With its help, you can learn how to do customer development for one-two-three. <br><br><h3>  4. All Intercom books, in particular ‚ÄúIntercom on Product Management‚Äù </h3><br>  Must read for product.  How to say the introduction of some features "no."  All because there are no simple and easy changes.  There is something behind each of them.  And the product‚Äôs task is to understand why they are needed and what can be obtained from it. <br><br><h3>  5. ‚ÄúGrowth hacks‚Äù by Aladdin Happy </h3><br>  Very simple and applicable hacks, with which you can hack multiple metrics.  Valuable not only by applicability, but also by the fact that it loads into the head the principles on which they work.  And already, having reworked these principles, our neural network in the brain can generate new hacks for our product. <br><br><h2>  Five books of Mikael Geletsyan, product manager at Children's World and KidZania Moscow </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/59/e1/09/59e1099591bcc752899905.jpeg"><br><br><h3>  1. ‚ÄúAgile Product Management with Scrum: Creating Products that Customers Love‚Äù </h3><br>  The book is immersed in Agile from head to toe.  It is very easy to read, the principles formulated in it are just as easy to remember.  How to create a product, push it to the market, and prevent it from drowning in bugs, introducing new features. <br><br><h3>  2. "Inspired" Marty Sagan </h3><br>  The book mentioned in this list already four times.  In each of the four collections.  Without it, nowhere.  You already understand this. <br><br><h3>  3. ‚ÄúDelivering Happiness: A Path to Profits, Passion, and Purpose‚Äù / ‚ÄúDelivering Happiness‚Äù Tony Hsieh </h3><br>  The book is not a boy, but a husband about how you can start with a farm for breeding worms at 9 years old, and a half dozen years later to sell your company (no, not with worms) to Microsoft, and then also Zappos to Amazon.  How to increase sales without making mistakes, make the right product and not to burn.  Book case, book experience. <br><br><h3>  4. ‚ÄúLean Analytics‚Äù Alistair Croll </h3><br>  The second time in this collection.  The book is about the right product analytics that benefits. <br><br><h3>  5. ‚ÄúThinking, Fast and Slow‚Äù / ‚ÄúThink slowly, solve quickly‚Äù Daniel Kahneman </h3><br>  How people think and how to use it.  What systematic errors are there, how does thinking work?  An excellent product book for mankind to benefit the product. <br><br>  Thanks for attention!
