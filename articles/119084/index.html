Not so long ago there was a similar case in my life, I had to undergo a correction in a strict regime institution.  This period is over, and now, with a sigh of relief, I can finally describe the possibilities for supporting the vital functions of the brain that we have in modern domestic correctional institutions, namely in the field of IT. <br><br>  I will not speak about mobile devices, since I was interested in the possibilities of programming in PHP + MySQL under Apache.  With mobile devices there everything is all right, for the entire period of stay that only I did not come across: both iPhones and touchscreen smartphones, and what is there just not.

      The search for the possibility of programming in such conditions, so that on leaving my head continued to work as well as before, led me to a general education school upon establishment.  And, as it turned out, they are at all such institutions.  It turns out to deprive a person of the opportunity to get an education <s>so far no</s> one has the right.  This school was mainly focused on receiving full and incomplete secondary education (it is possible to get a certificate of grade 9 or 11).  And no mention of the fact that the school at the correctional institution in the certificate will not be.  In addition, there were electives in computer science and the English language.  The technical equipment of the informatics office must be given its due.  Several computers (powerful enough - the weakest was a 1.2 GHz target), a laptop is also up to par, a bunch of all kinds of bells and whistles: an interactive whiteboard, a document camera, a projector, and the like.  But, most importantly, it was possible to access the Internet at speeds up to 2 Mbit per second! <br><br>  As for software: a collection of fairly good programs in the form of a folder with disks called ‚Äú <a href="http://www.spohelp.ru/">First Aid</a> ‚Äù was supplied annually.  In a set of both Windows with an office and a bunch of programs from Photoshop to C ++ builders, and Linux. <br><br>  All this made me very happy.  All that remained to do was to provide oneself with a separate computer, to supply the necessary software and to be able to go online in order to keep abreast of events.  The world, as we know, is not without good people.  They helped with the purchase of the company, brought it and, as humanitarian aid, transferred it to this educational institution.  Next thing technology.  As a result, I installed Ubuntu, php, mysql, apache2, geany and <s>calmly</s> when I got into programming.  The brain during this time did not completely atrophy, and something even turned out to be done.  In particular, a significant part of the current functionality of the portal <a href="http://www.avto25.ru/">Avto25.Ru</a> was written by me in the <s>conditions close to human</s> that period. <br><br>  So, even if you find yourself in the seemingly worst situation and inhuman conditions, you can use time and get the desired result. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119084/</a></p>
