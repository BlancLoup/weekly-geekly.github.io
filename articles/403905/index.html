  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to increase the battery life of the smartphone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Modern smartphones from model to model become smarter, more capable, more productive - and more voracious.  Most of the time devices are in standby mode, but even so rarely live without recharging for more than one or two days.  Let's try to increase the battery life of the gadget from the inside - using system settings and advanced applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/bf4/17b/ab4/bf417bab4f1743fe89bdfc2e193d2a74.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Most of the energy is consumed by the backlight of the screen, the maintenance of GSM, LTE and WiFi signals, as well as the work of the processor.  We will not describe the extreme methods of extending the life of a smartphone: switching to a black and white gamut, maximizing the brightness or turning off all sensors and transmitters.  It is more interesting to find a way to increase the time of the device in the normal mode, when calls are passed, notifications are delivered, and applications are flying. <br><br>  To do this, you need to force the smartphone to do only what is required at the moment, and the rest of the time - to ‚Äúsleep‚Äù.  Calculate how long the mobile phone is in your pocket, on the table or next to the bed.  Yes, most of the day!

      We will fight for the time using the built-in Android tools, applications that do not require root-rights, and advanced "geek" programs.  To do this, you will have to delve a little into theory in order to understand where the necessary potential hides. <br><br><h2>  Standard tools </h2><br>  The power saving features built into Android expand from version to version.  A radical breakthrough in this direction happened when a new Doze Mode sleep algorithm appeared in Marshmallow.  It is activated at the moment when the phone is not connected to the charge and lies motionless.  After half an hour or an hour of inactivity on the part of the user, Doze sends all applications to deep sleep (App Standby), giving them the opportunity to connect with the outside world after 1, 2 and 4 hours. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/064/a3f/048/064a3f04857e4a09994b9f45827d17c9.jpg"><br><br>  In Andriod 7.0 Nougat, this mode was refined - it starts earlier, does not depend on information from motion sensors (which means that the phone can ‚Äúsleep‚Äù in your pocket, for example).  Doze Mode always works, it can not be accidentally disabled in the system settings. <br><br>  The conclusion is simple: the newer Android on your smartphone, the longer the device will work on a single charge.  If there is an opportunity to upgrade the system, do it without thinking.  And if there is an energy saving switch in the menu - turn it on and the result will not take long.  But the owners of chocolate and candy versions of Android should not be discouraged - the applications below are just for them. <br><br><h2>  System improvements </h2><br>  There are a large number of applications that take on the role of "life exploders" of the gadget on one battery charge.  Putting everything in a row is not worth it, the quantity only harms the quality.  Only a well-chosen combination of programs with different functionality will give the best result.  In our case, consider the "sweet couple" from Go Battery Saver and Greenify, suitable for most users of mobile devices on Android. <br><br>  <b>GO Battery Saver</b> is a convenient intelligent manager of managing the basic settings of a smartphone.  In the "Mode" tab, you can configure power saving policies - disable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and data transfer scenarios, perform synchronization.  With root rights, Battery Saver can automatically change processor frequencies to achieve the most energy savings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b15/9c5/921/b159c59213734939bd3330db6bcc1cb2.jpg"><br><br>  It is possible to customize the change of modes according to the events: when the charge remains below a certain value, according to time and upon connection to charging. <br><br>  The application is very visual, it shows the consumption schedule, the most voracious programs, the estimated time of work in different modes.  In addition, the program promises to affect the progress of charging the phone in order to increase battery life. <br><br>  In fact, this is a kind of command center where you can monitor the power consumption of a device by setting general policies.  Battery Saver does not know how to actively intervene in the work of programs, but it manages to manage the OS settings well. <br><br>  In contrast, the application <b>Greenify</b> specializes in taming programs that often take the phone out of rest - the so-called Wakelocks.  Recall the theory.  When we press the shutdown button or just leave the mobile phone unattended, its screen goes blank, Android tries to put the device into a suspend-state, in which the computational cores are turned off, and the voltage is applied only to the RAM.  Running applications that can run in the background, do not allow the device to go into this mode, a lock called Wakelock is used.  If the gadget is already in suspend mode, the application can wake it up at the right time using the AlarmManager object.  In practice, this is manifested in the fact that your phone suddenly wakes up, climbs onto the Internet, calls about notifications, and then gets ready for bed again. <br><br>  The more frequently the device is activated, the more energy it spends.  So we need to catch applications and services that abuse "wake-locks" and force them to freeze.  In order to find out who is naughty, you will need a special utility, for example, <b>Wakelock Detector</b> .  The application requires root-rights or clever installation via connecting the phone to the PC in debug mode.  But the result is detailed statistics on which process has disturbed the system many times since the device was last charged. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/c63/3f2/1cf/c633f21cf1ba4be784783632e0edab97.png"></div><br>  If you are too lazy to mess around with the utility, try to just follow who is constantly in the top of the statistics on energy consumption.  This will allow to determine the candidates for a hard freeze. <br><br>  But back to Greenify, it was created in order to ‚Äúgrinify‚Äù the selected applications immediately after turning off the screen.  This program is very concise.  When you run it in the list of available programs, you must select those to which you want to apply automatic hibernation.  And yet, no longer need to go to Greenify, it will not bother you with any notifications and reports.  And the result will feel on the same day. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8ba/a96/446/8baa96446c3345ad809dd18730481e0e.jpg"></div><br>  With root-rights and an installed Xposed framework, an application can ‚Äúgrinify‚Äù system processes, track the reasons for applications to exit hibernation, and ‚Äúfreeze‚Äù even the most cunning ones.  Also Greenify can manage the processor.  With a given periodicity, he collects a queue of applications to the processor, and then ‚Äúen masse‚Äù sends them to run.  Due to this, the total time spent by the CPU in the active mode is significantly reduced.  Perhaps this is the most useful program to increase the operating time of a mobile device. <br><br><h2>  ROOT to help </h2><br>  For those who have acquired superuser rights on their device and are not afraid to go deep into the software stuffing, there are advanced applications.  One of them - <b>Amplify</b> - is similar to Greenify in terms of features, but offers more fine-tuning.  For example, you can set the period in seconds with which each process can wake the system.  In addition, Amplify suppresses the main system processes that devour energy: NlpWakelock, NlpCollectorWakeLock, ALARM_WAKEUP_LOCATOR and ALARM_WAKE_ACTIVITY_DETECTION.  In general, a useful thing in the right hands. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/118/99b/16b/11899b16bbab4465859b7f09ecce07c5.jpg"></div><br>  Owners of smartphones with modern versions of Android that support Doze mode will clearly like the <b>ForceDoze</b> and <b>Doze</b> applications, which allow you to change the time before going into deep sleep mode and adjust other conditions.  These programs form a ‚Äúwhite list‚Äù of applications that can wake the phone even during the deepest sleep. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/65b/cd0/13f/65bcd013f6924d9c9e1ba9b23cac4398.png"></div><br>  The above applications with proper use will extend the operating time of your devices for at least a few hours, but on the condition that you let them out of your hands at least for a while. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/403905/">https://habr.com/ru/post/403905/</a></p>
