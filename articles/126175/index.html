  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ERP? First, a holistic understanding of the business system</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the sandbox already wrote this topic, only there, unfortunately, the pictures did not come out, so I repeat) <br>  Companies today are developed fragmentary, business goals, processes, results are often little related.  Business works by inertia, few people think about the high-level understanding of their company.  But when it comes time automation - implement CRM or even the ERP system all the same you need to start from the very top.  Automation often acts as an impetus for building a complete system. <br>  I offer a <b>checklist to verify the company's readiness for automation</b> : <br>  1. Strategy <br>  2. Business model <br>  3. Social architecture <br>  4. Business processes <br>  5. Technical architecture <br>  6. Results <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>so</b> <br>  1. For a holistic understanding of the business system, first of all you need to find out the <b>goals of the company</b> and its strategy, how it intends to achieve these goals.  Here, a situation is possible when the owners and management of a business are different people and each has their own goals, their own ‚Äúlocal‚Äù tasks and are not talking about any strategy.  In this case, neither of which ERP-system can not be talked about.  It is necessary to launch a consulting project for management in order to form a single vision of the company. <br><img src="http://imglink.ru/pictures/12-08-11/bbf257263e0a3adab2540cb43b32c63c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  2. Next, we look at how <b>the</b> company's <b>business model</b> is built, namely: <br><ul><li>  Activities </li><li>  Offered benefits </li><li>  Customer relationship </li><li>  Customer segments </li><li>  Cash flow </li><li>  Sales channels </li><li>  Key resources </li><li>  Cost structure </li><li>  Main partners </li></ul><br>  If one of the points does not have a clear unambiguous understanding - see point one. <br><img src="http://imglink.ru/pictures/12-08-11/f3b372bc6755954c43539dccebefe484.jpg" alt="image"><br>  3. The foundation of any company is <b>people</b> .  It is necessary to clearly represent the personnel policy and the accepted practice in the team.  Social architecture determines the composition of personnel, skills and abilities, habits in work and in relations with customers, suppliers and other partners, feedback between all levels of management and execution. <br><img src="http://imglink.ru/pictures/12-08-11/1ec5b50d42a8a04c88dccb9b2e07c571.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Without communication anywhere!  A clear organizational structure should be. <br>  4. The logical <b>structure of the network of processes and each individual process</b> .  Employees must understand the essence of their operations, communication and the consequences of their actions on the subsequent links of the chain.  We need to understand not so much how certain operations are done, it is more important to understand why they are being done and why they are being done, because in the future information system the answer to the question ‚ÄúHow?‚Äù May be quite different. <br><img src="http://imglink.ru/pictures/12-08-11/656aae9afb75b389c92363e9545b14dd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  5. Before the start of the automation project, it is important to know the " <b>technical condition</b> " of the facility.  Electric and telecommunication channels, servers, routers, providers, then we look at the level above - hardware of workplaces, operating systems, databases, applied infrastructure software, further applied business systems, where operational activities are being conducted and, finally, means communication, through which employees interact with each other and the world around them. <br><img src="http://imglink.ru/pictures/12-08-11/df6fcbf4e9592ebbda1ea52d9dd29722.jpg" alt="image"><br>  6. If at the first stage everything is in order with goals and strategy, here we must see the <b>result</b> .  Does he fit these goals?  We do exactly what we need, and most importantly, our customers.  From the first stage, KPIs go down here, here we measure according to certain criteria what we received and transmit to all previous levels - in <b>order to receive it we need and sufficiently available system at each level?</b> <br>  If the answer is " <b>Yes</b> ", then we don‚Äôt need any ERP system, think about it when we see or predict a real limitation. <br>  If the answer is " <b>No</b> ", we initiate a project on integrated automation, where the highest priority is at the bottleneck, and complex in order to try on the changes to all components of the business system so as not to lose the company's holistic understanding. <br><img src="http://imglink.ru/pictures/12-08-11/9d76ae52b3e1422145ed3c67b4c79269.jpg" alt="image"><br>  If you liked the post, plus karma, so I gave an invite to the author of the article. </div>
