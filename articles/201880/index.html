Overview of the most popular category of children's applications</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4f9/09e/146/4f909e1464139cd56c2a034b57712fca.jpg"><br>  Puzzle is probably the most popular genre of apps for kids.  This project is almost all novice developers.  The logic is simple - children love puzzles, the technical implementation is relatively not complicated - why not.  Unfortunately, in the end, the number of low-quality crafts on this topic in the AppStore rolls over and it is very difficult for parents to find something worthy and useful for their children. <br>  Therefore, having enlisted the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/kinderfox/blog/200976/">support of the majority of readers</a> in the first review of useful children's applications, we bring to your attention three of the most attractive and effective educational games for puzzles released in 2013. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, Disclaimer: <b>The author of the review has nothing to do with the authors of the applications described</b> , all applications are selected only in terms of their usefulness for teaching children, from the point of view of the author. <br><br>  So: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/531/690/ffc/531690ffc1e9de30a4b2d569442ea0f3.png"><h4>  Toddlers Educational Building Puzzle Game: puzzle tower </h4><br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/tiny-hands-children-educational/id620871445%3Fmt%3D8">Free</a> , there are in-app purchases.

The cost of the integrated purchase of all puzzles is 66 rubles.  Such children's applications are designed for the smallest.  They allow you to learn the basics of logical thinking with the help of fun tasks and cute pictures.  Navigation in the game is intuitive, so the developers' statement that child psychologists took part in creating the application is quite realistic. <br><br>  Attached are four levels of difficulty and 12 small games.  In each game you need to organize the elements of the turrets on the principle of "more - less."  This is the same as the children's game of rings, only on the screen of a mobile device.  In the free version is available only one level, the easiest.  In it, the child shows a snowman or a ship, which then splits into three elements.  They will need to be collected from larger to smaller.  So the child learns the logical understanding of what is happening.  If difficulties arise, you can use the hint.  At more complex levels, pictures and elements are already bigger. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cbf/60b/0ca/cbf60b0ca04bdf25bc6c59b01911bf7a.png"><h4>  Animal Sounds Puzzle: Understanding the whole as a sum of parts </h4><br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/animal-sounds-puzzle-for-kids/id516242597%3Fl%3Den%26mt%3D8">Free</a> , there are in-app purchases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/274/4b3/b05/2744b3b05566908a55bf24e8d634c8d1.jpg"><br>  The application is designed for children from the age of 1 year.  The problem is solved quite simply and attractively: to explain to the one-year-old child the concept of the whole as the sum of parts.  To do this, the developers have drawn 10 attractive pictures with different animals.  Like other tutorials for the little ones, Animal Sounds Puzzle uses bright, eye-catching shades and high-quality animation. <br><br>  Touching a picture with an animal scatters it into several parts.  The child will need to find them and return to their places in order to put the picture together again.  As soon as he copes with this task, the animal will give a voice and soap bubbles will appear that can be slammed.  We can confirm that the children really like this game, so get ready to fork out for 66 rubles and buy the rest of the pictures, because only two out of ten pictures are available in the free version. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35e/6ae/9f4/35e6ae9f45e907a4c3fb99833b6e9cba.png"><h4>  Buzzle Drag and Drop: Pattern Recognition </h4><br>  <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/buzzle-kids-free-educational/id452974777%3Fmt%3D8">Free</a> , there are in-app purchases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/51b/537/7c1/51b5377c17b2e025106021f2f93461aa.jpg"><br>  This application is more complicated than the previous one.  It is intended for children aged 2 to 6 years.  A total of 31 pictures are available.  There are only ten of them in the free version.  There are images of space, numbers and letters, sea and nature landscapes.  Some of the fragments are ‚Äúwhitened‚Äù on the images, and they should be filled according to the puzzle principle.  Thus, the child learns to recognize the already complete image.  Such educational applications can be part of the full preparation of the child for school. <br><br>  In addition, it is necessary to correlate the shape and its outline in order to drag an element exactly where it should be.  This teaches the child a complex perception of visual images.  And as a nice bonus and reward for diligence, he will be able to hear the sounds of nature that accompany this or that picture.  The application has been recognized as one of the best in this area and has received numerous awards. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/201880/">https://habr.com/ru/post/201880/</a></p>
