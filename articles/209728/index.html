  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is the difference between the security of the behavior of the average user and the conscious?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Every day, information appears on social networks, on forums and on various websites, as a regular user of modern technologies has become a victim of fraudsters.  And how many posts are written about this on Habr√©, supplemented by comments - you can read a week like a great book on the safety of using the benefits of civilization.  But let's ask ourselves a simple question: how do most consumers of this information behave?  The answer is obvious: reads, closes the page and ... forgets.  Only a small part of users is trying to learn from other people's mistakes, so as not to repeat them.  But conscious users of modern technology are so scarce that I have almost no doubts - for many people this material will rediscover the meaning of daily and familiar actions, the dangers of which are almost always ignored, although there will be truths for conscious users in this post. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We have long been accustomed to the fact that modern technologies, due to their mass character, facilitate the relief of various aspects of the life of most people.  And we are happy to use new products that promise us unprecedented opportunities, comfort, privileges, savings, status - yes, whatever, as long as we replenish the list of users of a product manufacturer or service provider.  Digital technologies have penetrated so deeply into our lives that every proposal related to the expansion of various possibilities in mobile phones, bank cards, tablets, accounts in services is considered mandatory if not used, then at least, to be tried.  And the first thing that the average user thinks about is convenience, and only then safety.  Perhaps for some it will be a discovery, but this is precisely the difference between the ordinary user and the conscious user.  At the same time, one should not confuse a conscious user with an advanced one - the majority of conscious users of modern technologies are neither programmers nor other technical specialists.  To clearly demonstrate this line, let's go through the most common technological tools, which are today part of the life of modern man. <br><br><h4>  Browser </h4><br>  How does a regular user behave?  ‚ÄúI need 100,500 bookmarks ... Clear cookies and temporary files?  No, then I can‚Äôt go straight to the mail and social networks, I‚Äôll have to log in every time ... But all the passwords are written on stickers on the bottom of the monitor just in case ... so that you can quickly copy, not print, saved in txt file in My Documents ... Secure connection?  Isn't the provider secure connection?  In the browser settings?  Oh, I do not know what https is ... and why check certificates of authenticity?  And in general, there are a lot of incomprehensible words, I'd rather leave it as it is - the browser works well, it means you don‚Äôt need to change anything ... And let the updates automatically load ‚Äî they are for security, well, there are all kinds of viruses from the viruses ... and the plug-ins are different too needed - to watch videos, open pdf-files, download music, search through a browser in search engines ... I also need a toolbar - it shows the weather, time and exchange rates, and here you can configure it to notify about new messages in mail ... ".  Well, and so on. <br>  How does a conscious user behave?  ‚ÄúWhat is the point of bookmarking addresses of sites that I visit every day?‚Äù  I already know them ... I don‚Äôt want any specialist from the browser developer to control my interests on the network without my knowledge ... Therefore, at least different applications, only the most necessary and proven by other users ... HTTPS is not a panacea for ills, but at least some protection ... Cookies and temporary files are deleted after the browser is closed ... There are no automatic updates and ‚Äúconvenient plugins‚Äù - I myself will choose what I need ... No sending reports to the developer about the problems - he will not solve them anyway just because he will receive from me report my  he doesn‚Äôt care about problems at all ... Toolbars ?!  In order to inform developers about outbound traffic for targeting displayed ads?  And of course, no browser saving passwords ... ‚Äù.  Well, and so on. <br><br><h4>  Email </h4><br>  How does a regular user behave?  ‚ÄúI have one box - but I always remember it ... I also remember the password - I check my mail every day, and I have it simple, well, so as not to forget ... Everywhere where I register, I specify one email - it's convenient , you do not need to look for anything ... I have here confirmations from the Internet Bank about operations, and movements in e-wallets, and orders from online stores, and reports on new activities of friends in social networks, and registration data of accounts on different sites, and notifications about payment for various state services, and all relatives, friends and colleagues  th write to this address ... Delete old unwanted messages?  Well, what if they need me in many, many years? .. Yes, the address book in the box should collect addresses from my mail - it helps to drive the address when I want to write a letter to someone ... Change the password every month?  But who needs me to hack me?  Even if they are hacked, what will they find interesting in my mail?  I'm an ordinary person, not an oligarch or a criminal any ... ".  Well, and so on. <br>  How does a conscious user behave?  ‚ÄúFor work ‚Äî a working box; for personal correspondence ‚Äî personal; for accounts on the network ‚Äî the third ... Passwords from the maximum possible number of numeric and alphabetic characters, of different registers, of course, and this is not the mother's maiden name or passport number ... Passwords change every month, and if there is a suspicion of a hacking attempt, then immediately, and all ... Letters older than one year, if they do not contain important information, are deleted - why litter the box? .. There is no need to save addresses in the address book - when there is no garbage can in the box letter from the addressee can be found w  a minute ... No personal data is sent by e-mail - and if there is a need, it is only in the archive and any left word, and after sending, the letter with the file is forcibly deleted ... No use of services connected to the mail account ... And, Of course, email addresses are not left at random to avoid spam and interference to crack a box ... ‚Äù.  Well, and so on.

    <h4>  Cloud storage </h4><br>  How does a regular user behave?  ‚ÄúOooh, gigabytes of space on a virtual hard disk - it's so cool - no more spending money on flash drives and removable disks! .. Now from any place I can get any necessary file with a couple of clicks - you only need an Internet connection ... This daddy is for files from e-mail ... This daddy for my documents - scans of passports, invoices, statements, contracts ... This daddy is for documents to government agencies - declarations, reports, balance sheets, applications, license scans ... This daddy is for video from a phone ... This daddy is for photos ... This daddy for books ... "  .  Well, and so on. <br>  How does a conscious user behave?  "Cloud storage?  Well, perhaps, as a file sharing service, if you give access to a specific file to a specific recipient ... Keep personal data files there ?!  God forbid! .. Save copies of documents sent to state bodies under the pretext of quick access to them?  Madness! .. Keep online working documents, especially having confidential data?  I'm not so irresponsible ... Old personal photos and videos are still possible, and then in the archive - for history ... Movies, books, music - of necessity, if there is some rarity ... There is no automatic setting to save mail files to the cloud storage ... ‚Äù.  Well, and so on. <br><br><h4>  Social networks </h4><br>  How does a regular user behave?  ‚ÄúHere is my photo on the avatar ... But the name of the city in which I live ... And it's okay that the system recognizes my location, from where I go and write statuses ... Here is the name of the company in which I now work in such and such position ... in these I worked with such and such for a certain year so and so ... This is my mobile phone number - if anyone wants to find me, when I'm not online, call at any time ... <br>  Confirmation of the entrance to the social network on your mobile?  Well, I‚Äôm already hanging out in the social networks from morning till night - no one will log in while I‚Äôm online ... View session logs every time?  What for?  I don‚Äôt know what my IP address is, especially at work he is alone, at home is another, on a mobile is third, in a cafe, when I go from a tablet via Wi-Fi-fourth ‚Äî you don‚Äôt remember everything ... Send photos and videos from your phone from the social network at once - it's so modern, all friends will be in the know ... Yes, and it‚Äôs good that friends mark me on their photos and videos - so I‚Äôll see photos and videos where I am ... Why clean up correspondence with friends and colleagues?  And what if I need it in many, many years? .. Applications in the social network are great, you can not go to different sites, everything is in your account ... "And so on. <br>  How does a conscious user behave?  ‚ÄúTo register on social networks, I have a separate SIM card ... I use it to pass double identification at the entrance ... Where and by whom do I work?  Friends and colleagues already know - and the rest is this information for what? .. I look, friends and colleagues also know, if someone wants to see in person, they can personally ask ... And you can do marks on photos and videos with me, only if I do not mind ... Yes, session logs are reviewed every time you log into accounts, in time to discover the left IP or simultaneous session, which should not be ... There are no geolocation services in the social network ‚Äî those I trust in my whereabouts, and so they know where I am ... Applications in social networks?  So that they get access to account data, what are they warning you when connecting to them? .. ".  Well, and so on. <br><br><h4>  Electronic Wallets </h4><br>  How does a regular user behave?  ‚ÄúIt's so great that you can, without taking your back off the chair, pay for almost anything you want! .. And mobile, and Internet, and digital television, and purchases from online stores, and tour trips, and programs, and games, and theater and cinema tickets, and pizza delivery, and housing and communal services, and fines - the main thing is that there is always money in the wallet ... It‚Äôs safe to keep them there - because the transfer requires not only access to the wallet, but also a secret code - the double protection is safe ... Yes, you can still give the purse number to relatives, if they suddenly want to transfer money, or indicate on the message boards  as a method of payment when you sell some unnecessary thing ... Nothing to fill in passport data - only the administrators of the Internet wallet can see it anyway, they will not use it ... Yes, and there is a great way to bind your wallet to the banking the card ran out of money - transferred to the wallet from the card, not enough on the card - transferred from the wallet to the card ... ‚Äù.  Well, and so on. <br>  How does a conscious user behave?  ‚ÄúI only use the online wallet for small purchases that cannot be done in any other way ... Keep money in your wallet?  I want to pay - I‚Äôm charging the right amount, I spend it right there so as not to leave the opportunity for the attackers to rob me ... If I send someone my wallet number, I‚Äôll delete the message with the number after receiving ... If I get money in my wallet, I immediately transfer to the card I make a payment for something needed - no balances in my wallet, even for a day ... I change my password to my wallet after several transactions, just in case - you never know what the recipient of electronic money has to get data with the payment  Why be tied to the wallet bank card?  To pay the service a fee for transferring my money from my wallet to my card?  And to inform the service, in which bank I serve and what card do I have? .. ‚Äù.  Well, and so on. <br><br><h4>  Bulletin Board </h4><br>  How does a regular user behave?  "I occasionally sell unnecessary things to buy new ones, so I need an account on bulletin boards ... I don‚Äôt know which ones are the most visited, so I‚Äôm registering on a few ... In the announcement I give my first and last name, my email address - so that potential the buyer could write a mobile phone ‚Äî so that he could call, indicate the nearest metro station, in the area where I can make a sale, usually near the house or work ... If the buyer is from another city, I indicate the number of the electronic wallet so that  roared the money, if it‚Äôs more convenient for him ... Or you can arrange to send it to another city with cash on delivery at the mailing address ... ‚Äù  Well, and so on. <br>  How does a conscious user behave?  ‚ÄúThe account on the bulletin board is put on a special mail address, for various network needs ... Is the nearest metro indicated in the ad?  And if I sell some valuable thing?  I do not know who the potential buyer is ... For the same reason, I leave the mobile number not personal, but the one who, to confirm the registration of accounts on the network, keeps him in touch before making a deal ... Meet a stranger near the house or work, even if the subway will not, in the city center is full of places where you can meet, check the thing, check the authenticity of the money ... If the buyer is from another city, then either a bank transfer or cash on delivery for the parcel, upon receipt ... ".  Well, and so on. <br><br><h4>  Geolocation Services </h4><br>  How does a regular user behave?  ‚ÄúIt's great that there is an opportunity to check in all the places I visit! .. Here I am going in the elevator at home - hello, neighbors! .. Here I am at work - colleagues, ay! .. Here I am going to meet with a client to a multi-storey business center - maybe there is someone nearby? .. Here I‚Äôm having dinner after work in an excellent restaurant with friends - who are close by, join us! .. Here I am going to my grandmother in a sleeping area - none of my friends live there ?. Here I am at the airport, I fly away on a business trip - do you have someone to drink coffee with before you depart? .. Here I am in a hotel in the city of N - there are compatriots next door  tva? .. ".  Well, and so on. <br>  How does a conscious user behave?  ‚ÄúGeolocation services?  Those to whom I can entrust information about my movements at a specific period of time, and so can find out where I am by calling or writing to me - why should I tell strangers where my home or place of work, or city of business trip, or place of vacation? .. "  Well, and so on. <br><br>  I think that the examples of the use of modern technologies have shown that ordinary users are like an open book that anyone can read.  It is not difficult to guess that not always outside interest can be caused by innocuous curiosity, so the victims of intruders are often the antipodes of a conscious user, pecking at all the lures to try innovations packed under the guise of expanding convenience and modern trends.  These users then most often sincerely wonder where different companies and strangers know about them so much and why, after being subjected to one hack, they are exposed to them further. <br><br>  If among your friends, acquaintances or relatives there are those whom you could rank as ordinary users from the examples given, show them this post.  And when they read it, ask a simple question: what is the difference between a regular user and a conscious user?  If they answer correctly, then something from the written to them has reached, and we can hope for changes in the behavior towards the conscious, but if not - together we wish them good luck in life. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/209728/">https://habr.com/ru/post/209728/</a></p>
