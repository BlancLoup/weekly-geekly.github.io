At the same time, everyone has the right to protection from spam and normal electronic communications, just not everyone knows about it.  In order to contribute to the fight against hated spam, make life easier for our customers, and generally make the world a slightly more comfortable place to live, we, together with the Spamorez company, developed a new service under the straightforward name ‚ÄúClean Mail‚Äù. <br><br>  If you do not load readers with marketing techniques, then the key value of the new service is a thorough and customizable filtering of incoming emails at a level inaccessible to the "regular" antivirus and antispam.  Before getting into the box to the user, located at our facilities, the letter passes through a corporate multistage filter on the Spamorez servers.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Then the mail arrives at the Cloud One Exchange server, where it is additionally checked for compliance with the established policies ‚Äî the black list, and so on.  Thus, the ‚Äúdouble cleaning‚Äù is achieved.  It is important here that cleaning takes only a few seconds and practically does not affect the speed of the mail. <br><br><h5>  The main advantages of ‚ÄúClean Mail‚Äù are briefly: </h5><br><br>  ‚Ä¢ Works on company domain <br>  ‚Ä¢ Does not contain spam and viruses <br>  ‚Ä¢ No need to buy, install and configure servers <br>  ‚Ä¢ You can get a new box in a few minutes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b36/636/120/b366361202a2871892debf888e365fba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  Who and what is it for? </h5><br><br>  ‚ÄúClean Mail‚Äù is needed by all companies seeking to improve the efficiency of their operations, reduce the cost of equipment and employees, and also get reliable service at an adequate price.  Today, everyone uses e-mail at work, but for a huge mass of small and medium-sized companies, it is either used inefficiently, or does not correspond to the understanding of business mail, being located on various mass mail services, without connecting to the company's own domain. <br><br><h5>  How does ‚ÄúNet Mail‚Äù help save? </h5><br><br>  When using ‚ÄúNet Mail‚Äù you can seriously save on several factors at once.  First, you do not need to purchase, put in the office (or data center) and keep on balance a separate mail server.  Secondly, it will not be necessary to pay the salary to the administrator, who ‚Äúraises‚Äù him and monitors the performance.  Mail will work on external equipment, it will not need to be configured and updated.  Thirdly, an additional effect will be given by the increase in the working time of employees, who previously left for ‚Äúraking up mail‚Äù and manual filtering of correspondence.  And fourth, the cost of Internet traffic will be significantly reduced. <br><br><h5>  What filters are used? </h5><br><br>  Here are just the basic tools used in mail filtering.  Their total number reaches hundreds. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Signs of mass messages <br>  ‚Ä¢ Verification of the sender <br>  ‚Ä¢ Bayes Algorithm (dynamic categorization by category) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Continuous monitoring for new types of spam. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Intent analysis <br>  ‚Ä¢ RFC header analysis <br>  ‚Ä¢ history analysis <br>  ‚Ä¢ Black and White Lists <br>  ‚Ä¢ Text noise analysis <br><br><h5>  What else is ‚Äúnet mail‚Äù useful for? </h5><br><br>  Having mail on mass mail services, the company cannot maintain a uniform information policy, control its correspondence and be confident in the confidentiality of correspondence.  With the help of ‚ÄúClean Mail‚Äù, it is easy to manage employee mailboxes, back up correspondence, and control the distribution of information.  Shared calendars with meetings, meetings and other events work for all employees, and alerts are sent automatically.  And, of course, you do not have to re-teach the basics of computer literacy of the older generation - mail uses a familiar interface, familiar from Microsoft office applications. <br><br><h5>  Is it safe? </h5><br><br>  All data and correspondence are completely isolated; neither other clients nor the provider‚Äôs employees have access to them.  The equipment is located in a serious PCI-DSS certified data center. <br><br><h5>  How much is "Net Mail"? </h5><br><br>  The cost of the service "Net Mail" is 399 rubles for a 2-gigabyte mailbox per month and is reduced depending on the number of used boxes.  The price includes the actual mailbox and services for cleaning mail from unwanted correspondence.  No additional fees are charged, the volume of incoming and outgoing mail is not limited. <br><br>  You can order ‚ÄúClean Mail‚Äù in the new online store of the Cloud One services company at <a href="http://www.getsaas.ru/">www.getsaas.ru</a> , or on the Spamorez website at <a href="http://www.spamorez.ru/">www.spamorez.ru</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/119793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/119793/</a></p>
