  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MediaTek MT6595: impressions from ... chipset</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Some time ago I managed to closely familiarize myself with two flagship smartphones, namely, <b><a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/236237/">Lenovo Vibe X2</a></b> and <b><a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/235353/">Meizu MX4</a></b> .  By themselves, they are very different, but they also have a common feature - MediaTek MT6595 chipset.  This is the first platform in the world with an 8-core processor and an integrated LTE modem.  Due to the low price, it allows you to create smartphones that are not only inferior to Samsung models on Exynos and HTC chipsets on Qualcomm, but also in some ways noticeably superior to them.  There is every reason to believe that at the beginning of 2015 the market will be overwhelmed by a whole wave of flagship models on the MT6595 from the manufacturers of the ‚Äúsecond echelon‚Äù, and they will cost less than 15 thousand rubles (for comparison: flagships from A-brands with other chipsets cost 25-30 thousand ). <br><br>  Below I will talk about my impressions of these two devices on the MediaTek MT6595.  And before that, I note that the potential of the MediaTek solution is obvious not only to me: the same Meizu used Samsung Exynos chipsets in its previous devices, and was constantly proud of it.  In the new flagship model, the Chinese company switched to MediaTek. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d5f/21d/08b/d5f21d08b0114a9098252754bcbac26c.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Meizu MX4 and Samsung Galaxy S5</font> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7f/51f/d5d/b7f51fd5d888400aaec3bab0ee64f3d4.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Lenovo Vibe X2</font>

    <h2>  Lot of theory </h2><br>  So, <b>MT6595</b> is a chipset of 2014, numbering eight cores.  Let me remind you that at one time MediaTek released <b><a href="http://www.mediatek.com/en/products/mobile-communications/smartphone1/mt6592/">MT6592</a></b> - the world's first chipset, in which all the cores (architecture Cortex-A7) can work simultaneously. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/875/b56/8d6/875b568d6bb74ea0bda3c365126d4bb0.png"><br>  <font color="#999">Comparison of the work of the ‚Äútrue 8-core‚Äù MT6592 (below) with the ‚Äúunreal‚Äù (above)</font> <br><br>  Meanwhile, in MT6595, the MediaTek developers went further and implemented the <b><a href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/ARM_big.LITTLE">big.LITTLE</a></b> concept in its most progressive form, that is, on the principle of heterogeneous processor operation ( <abbr title="Heterogeneous multi-processing">HMP</abbr> ).  This means that, despite the differences in architecture, 8 cores from two clusters of 4 each can work simultaneously.  Moreover, thanks to the <b><a href="http://www.mediatek.com/en/products/hero-products/corepilot/">CorePilot</a></b> technology from MediaTek, also in any configuration: for example, 2 cores from one cluster and 1 from another can work simultaneously.  Or all at the same time.  Or only 1. This approach allows to increase the solution's performance by about 20% and reduce power consumption in some modes by 20%.  In addition, CorePilot provides control over the temperature mode of the processor and, as a result, of the device itself.  In other words, it is better protected from overheating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ab/4ae/000/8ab4ae000f0b4e06bb35361e2c386a40.png"><br>  <font color="#999">Goals and Objectives of CorePilot</font> <br><br>  As an example, let's take the following situation: the smartphone was in standby mode, and only 1 core worked at the minimum frequency.  Then the user launched a 3D game in which all 8 cores were included.  However, the chipset analyzed the situation and realized that all cores should not be started at the maximum frequency - enough, let's say, 1.5 GHz instead of the maximum 2.2.  As a result, less energy is wasted, the device practically does not heat up, and the game goes smoothly and does not slow down. <br><br>  A few words about architecture.  MT6595 includes 4 core ARM Cortex-A7, as well as 4 core ARM Cortex-A17.  Moreover, this chipset is the first in the world with the architecture of the latter type.  ARM says it is "about 60% faster than the Cortex-A9."  It is also worth noting that the MT6595 is presented in three versions - MT6595 itself, as well as MT6595M and MT6595T.  In the first case, the peak frequencies of the A7 and A17 cores reach 2.2 and 1.7 GHz, respectively, in the second - 2.0 and 1.5 GHz, and in the third - 2.5 and 1.7 GHz.  The Meizu MX4 is built on the top MT6595, and the Lenovo Vibe X2 on the slightly simpler MT6595M. <br><br>  In all three versions of the chipset, PowerVR G6200 graphics with different frequencies are used - one of the top solutions in the line of Imagination Technologies.  The maximum supported camera resolution is 20 megapixels, the screens are 2560x1600 pixels. <br><br>  There were some pleasant little things that were not previously encountered in MediaTek chipsets: for example, embedded codecs for video processing in <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.265">H.265</a> and support for Wi-Fi 802.11ac.  That such a miracle happened at MediaTek. <br><br><h2>  Some practice </h2><br>  On paper, all this is certainly impressive.  But the practice will be discussed below - I managed to ‚Äúdrive‚Äù the Meizu MX4 and Lenovo Vibe X2 for about a week. <br><br>  There can be a different attitude to benchmarks, but I‚Äôll give you the following screenshots.  Meizu MX4 is gaining more than 50 thousand points in <b><a href="http://www.antutu.com/en/index.shtml">AnTuTu</a></b> , Lenovo Vibe X2 - more than 47 thousand.  For comparison, the Samsung Galaxy S5 in the version on the Exynos chipset with 8 cores is about 38 thousand, while the devices on the MT6592 have 28-30 thousand.  In my opinion, the difference in the so-called "abstract parrots" is quite noticeable, and even important for someone.  Because not everyone buys new smartphones every six months or a year.  Many go with one device and for two years, and some - at all in the "until it breaks."  So, high results guarantee that the device will remain relevant for games for just a couple of years.  You never know what graphics will be made in some Asphalt 12 samples of 2016 ... But I am pretty sure that the devices with MT6595 will pull it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c19/dda/de9/c19ddade943f44898139fd70912939f9.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Results in AnTuTu.</font>  <font color="#999">From left to right: Samsung Galaxy S5, Lenovo Vibe X2 and Meizu MX4</font> <br><br>  Moreover - on the Meizu MX4 and Lenovo Vibe X2 started the game <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.phosphorgames.DarkMeadow%26hl%3Dru">Dark Meadow: The Pact</a></b> .  It is not very fresh, but very serious in terms of graphics and is still relevant.  It was originally developed for devices on nVidia Tegra 3, and no matter how much I tried to run it on models with other hardware platforms - LG Nexus 5 (Qualcomm Snapdragon 800), Samsung Galaxy S5 (Exynos 5422) and so on - it did not work.  But on the devices with MT6595 suddenly launched.  Nicely. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d23/0e5/280/d230e5280b79485cb93d9f37fabbf612.jpg"><br>  <font color="#999">Dark Meadow, launched on Meizu MX4</font> <br><br>  LTE support is also a definite plus.  Yes, new-fashioned Cat.  6 is not supported, however, in the conditions of Russian reality, Cat is enough.  4 (up to 150 Mbit / s).  And this means that downloading movies and other heavy files for a smartphone from a very heavy task in a matter of a few minutes. <br><br>  Not to mention the added support for GPS GLONASS.  Yes, the sense of it may not be as much as predicted at the dawn of the appearance of GLONASS / GPS receivers in mobile devices, but let it be better. <br><br>  The question of energy consumption stands out.  In general, MediaTek has always emphasized that it is struggling to save battery power ‚Äúwith a gun at the ready‚Äù, and it was even more interesting to evaluate how many devices work with such a powerful chipset inside.  Meizu MX4 (3100 mAh battery) works quietly for a day and a half, while Lenovo Vibe X2 (2300 mAh) - a day.  Video in FullHD 1080p first smartphone can play about 6 and a half hours, the second - about 4 and a half.  Blame for this result is exclusively Lenovo: 2300 mAh - not enough for a device with a 5-inch FullHD-screen. <br><br><h2>  Comparison of MT6595 and MT6592 </h2><br>  This article would be incomplete without comparing the specified chipsets.  I would remind you that MT6592 was announced in October 2013, it appeared in the first devices based on it in March 2014. MT6595 was introduced in February 2014, we only waited for smartphones based on it in autumn 2014. That is, the interval between releases of these platforms is six months, and here is progress, not afraid of this word, gigantic. <br><table><tbody><tr><td></td><td>  <b>MediaTek MT6592</b> </td><td>  <b>MediaTek MT6595</b> </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Configuration</b> </td><td>  8 cores (28 nm): <br>  - ARM Cortex-A7 up to 1.7 GHz, <br>  Can work simultaneously </td><td>  8 cores (28 nm): <br>  - 4 ARM Cortex-A17 cores up to 2.2 GHz <br>  - 4 ARM Cortex-A7 cores up to 1.7 GHz <br>  ARM big.LITTLE, can work simultaneously </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Graphic accelerator</b> </td><td>  Mali-450 </td><td>  PowerVR G6200 </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Results in AnTuTu</b> </td><td>  From 27 thousand points </td><td>  From 45 thousand points </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>RAM memory</b> </td><td>  Single channel mode: <br>  - 32 bits LPDDR2 533 MHz; <br>  - 32 bits LPDDR3 666 MHz; <br>  Bandwidth - up to 5.3 Gb / s </td><td>  Dual channel mode <br>  - 32 bits LPDDR3 933 MHz; <br>  Bandwidth - up to 14.9 Gb / s <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Wi-Fi</b> </td><td>  802.11n </td><td>  Wi-Fi 802.11ac </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>Navigation</b> </td><td>  GPS </td><td>  GLONASS / GPS </td></tr><tr><td>  <b>LTE</b> </td><td>  No (added using M6290) </td><td>  Yes (Cat.4) </td></tr></tbody></table>  "Naked" numbers in this comparison will not get off.  There are a number of proprietary technologies that were not in MT6592 and which appeared in MT6595.  A few words of them - below. <br><br><h2>  Branded chips MT6595 </h2><br>  The MT6592 technology was implemented <b>ClearMotion</b> to increase the frame rate of video from 24-30 per second to 60 in real time, which led to an increase in image clarity.  I emphasize: she worked only in the video.  But in MT6595 another, much more advanced development found its use: <b>Response Time Enhancement</b> .  It reduces the response time of the display and reduces by 50% the blurriness of the image of a moving object, typical of displays with a 60 Hz scanning frequency, ‚Äúanimating‚Äù everything that happens on the screen: video, photos, games, websites, and so on - any content.  On the basis of this development, together with Japan Display, MediaTek MT6595 supports displays with a scanning frequency of 120 Hz.  Due to this, higher smoothness is achieved in all situations - when scrolling, during transitions between elements of the Android interface, when playing video, when launching toys, and so on.  To be honest, this technology is from the category of those whose work is very difficult to evaluate in practice.  This would be possible if, say, I was given a copy of the Meizu MX4 with the included Response Time Enhancement and an instance with the disabled.  But ... In any case, this chip warms the soul. <br><br>  <b>MiraVision</b> technology enhances image clarity when displaying various multimedia content on the screen.  This is achieved by adjusting the intensity of the backlight depending on the brightness of the surrounding space and the color gamut of the content displayed on the screen.  Also, MiraVision technology saves battery power. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a96/009/3bb/a960093bb58746dfaccabedc86989f23.jpg"><br><br>  Well, one more thing - <b>Super-Slow Motion</b> - shooting video at a frequency of 480 (!) Frames per second and the possibility of subsequent playback at a speed of 1/16 of the nominal.  Curiously, probably, but in the Meizu MX4 and Lenovo Vibe X2 it is not implemented.  And this is normal: the developers themselves choose which chipmaker uses what to use in their products, and MediaTek does not decree them in this. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  In my opinion, the chipset is more than successful.  And, importantly, modern: devices for 15 thousand (Lenovo Vibe X2 is about that and costs, for example, and the Meizu MX4 is 2-3 thousand more expensive) will now be able to work with Wi-Fi 802.11ac, get LTE, and will also be compatible with almost any games for at least a couple of years.  And the play will be, perhaps, even nicer than the current flagships with price tags in the range of 25-30 thousand.  This is how technologies become accessible to the people, and personally it makes me very happy.  It remains to wait until other vendors roll out their devices to MT6595.  Most likely, their first "wave" will be held in early January in Las Vegas at CES 2015, the second - in February in Barcelona at MWC 2015. And there is not far to Computex 2015.  Although ... There is an opinion that at this June exhibition we will be shown the first models on the <b><a href="http://www.mediatek.com/en/products/mobile-communications/smartphone1/mt6795/">MT6795</a></b> chipset with 8 64-bit cores and LTE.  But this chipset and the story about it are a matter of the future.  Stay in touch. <br><br>  <i>I thank Meizu and Lenovo for providing smartphones for testing.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363951/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363951/</a></p>
