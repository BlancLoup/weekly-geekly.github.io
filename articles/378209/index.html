My first project was the release of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/press/1997/oct97/iepluspr.aspx">Internet Explorer 4 Plus</a> , the IE4 CD, and a bunch of other trial garbage, which we sold for $ 49 per box.  Yes, gather around the boys, now I will tell you about the times when browsers were sold in physical boxes on CompUSA, a pack of chewing gum cost half a cent, and the cola still contained cocaine. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, I digress. <br><br>  We released Internet Explorer 4 and were actively working on Internet Explorer 5, which was full of cool features, such as offline mode using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Definition_Format">CDF</a> , a completely new Trident engine, and also ‚ÄúWeblications‚Äù - which was well ahead of its time to give developers the opportunity to create rich applications in the browser (although, I think that this ultimately led to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XMLHttpRequest">invention of AJAX</a> ).

      At that time, I always stayed at work until 10 pm, mainly because of the free dinner, and the lack of privacy. <br><br>  And so, on one of these evenings, one of our senior developers, <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/microsoftpri0/2016771909_former_microsoft_windows_gm_bharat_shyam_named_sta.html">Bharat Shiyam,</a> asked me to look into his office to show something.  I think he was writing at that moment some amazing, but completely useless <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US6353926%3Fdq%3Dsoftware%2Bupdate%2Bnotification%2Bray%26hl%3Den%26sa%3DX%26ei%3DTiElUrLWCaGTiQL95oGYDQ%26ved%3D0CDYQ6AEwAA">specification or patent</a> .  So I went to his office, where I found Bhara bent over his computer - it was 133 MHz Pentium - in one window which was full of the ridiculous Win32 C ++ COM, and the other was its local IE5 build. <br><br>  ‚ÄúCheck it out,‚Äù he said, and added a bookmark to his favorites.  Surprisingly, there was a cute icon on the left of his bookmark!  Until then, no one had yet invented technology to do this.  However, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andressen</a> did not think about it, and this <a href="http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/08/09/the-ipo-that-inflated-the-dot-com-bubble.aspx">guy is rich</a> , is not it? <br><br>  Bharat said: ‚ÄúNot bad, isn't it?  Well, let's turn on this feature? ‚Äù.  I answered: ‚ÄúYes, of course, but how does it work?‚Äù.  Then he told me that all that needs to be done is to simply add the favicon.icon file to the root of your IIS server!  So I said, ‚ÄúOf course it sounds great,‚Äù and went back to my office. <br><br>  The next day, my boss called me over.  "Have you agreed on this feature?"  I replied: "Yes, of course."  Then he shouted at me, saying that Bharat used me - he specifically looked for a young PM to turn on this feature, and I had to refuse.  I promised that I would not do so in the future. <br><br>  But now, when I look back, I understand that we did everything right.  Seriously, how dangerous could this feature be? <br><br>  I still remember telling my friend <a href="http://www.radwin.org/michael/">Michael Redwin</a> from Yahoo about favicon.ico.  He looked through the <a href="http://www.radwin.org/michael/talks/yapache-oscon2006.pdf">Yapache</a> logs for the sake of interest, as he usually did, and noticed an unusual HTTP request at <a href="">www.yahoo.com/favicon.ico</a> .  He asked, what is this thing, favicon.ico?  I explained to him.  He was so excited that he immediately threw a favicon on the server, which seems to be the first official favicon in history. <br><br>  Here is the history of the invention of favicon.ico.  For you guys. <br><br>  Ray </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/378209/">https://habr.com/ru/post/378209/</a></p>
