It has a qHD display and not least a 5-row keyboard.  It is available for the Verizon operator and is locked for it, but by purchasing the unlock code you can unlock the device and it will work with other operators.  Droid can work both in GSM and in CDMA. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Personally, I bought a Droid 3 through a friend, and an unlock code on ebay. <br>  At the moment, everything works. <br><br><h3>  Now to the review itself! </h3>

    <h4>  Main technical characteristics </h4><br><ul><li>  Screen: Capacitive, 4 ", qHD (540 x 960) </li><li>  Processor: Texas Instruments OMAP 4430 </li><li>  Video accelerator: PowerVR SGX540 </li><li>  RAM (MB): 512 </li><li>  Built-in Memory Size (GB): 16 </li><li>  Wi-Fi: 802.11b, g, n </li><li>  Camera rear (MP): 8 </li><li>  Camera front (MP): 0.3 </li><li>  Weight (g): 184 </li><li>  Dimensions (mm): 64.1 x 123.3 x 12.9 </li><li>  Other: G-Sensor, Light sensor, Proximity sensor, Digital compass </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Equipment </h4><br>  The grade of the Droid 3 is very, very scanty, and more specifically, you get: <br>  - Motorola Droid 3 <br>  - Charging for American sockets <br>  - USB cable <br>  - A bunch of unnecessary papers in English (instructions, thanks, etc.) <br><br>  There is not even a headset, I am silent about the cover or capacitive stylus.  At the same time to charge the phone, you must plug the USB cable into the charging.  That is, once again there is a wild saving on the kit for the top device.  What for?!  It is much more pleasant to see a rich set when you buy a phone for decent money. <br><br><h4>  Appearance </h4><br>  For me, Droid 3 is currently the most beautiful device among all on the market.  In order not to argue, rate yourself on the photos.  Also, I will not describe the obvious, saying the camera is there, then there, etc. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/30e1618a/2bf4de9e/256dde4f/23d45c42.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/31ccbfa4/a5498c5d/d0b883e8/867a96cc.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/75c9cd1b/aa27cbd9/4f4db9f6/299bbdee.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Now a little about the mechanics.</b> <br>  <b>About controls.</b>  We have 4-D universal <i>touch</i> buttons to control the android.  For several days of use, they have never failed me, they always work clearly.  When for example on the Samsung Galaxy S touch buttons worked for me through time. <br>  <b>On the mechanism of the slider.</b>  It slides well and nicely, there are latches in the closed and open position.  It is impossible to close the phone accidentally, but to open it quite easily with a flick of the finger.  This is a bit annoying, because sometimes you start to open the slider randomly.  Everything else is top notch, the design does not play and has a pleasant, non-annoying sound. <br>  <b>About the keyboard.</b>  I want to immediately note that I really, really liked the keyboard.  It is more convenient than the Nokia N900, Desire Z, Motorola Milestone.  I can tell you this for sure, because I owned these phones.  On the Droid 3, we have a 5-row keyboard.  Especially liked the "arrows", very convenient for text editing.  Also I can not fail to mark a separate row of numbers.  The movement of the buttons is clear, they are large and located at a distance from each other, as a result of which it is very comfortable to type. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/fb2eb7de/533ea0f6/710a5766/bdc15550.jpg"><br>  About the appearance of this can be finished. <br><br><h4>  Screen </h4><br>  Our test 4-inch qHD screen, that is, with a resolution of 540 x 960. But there is one BUT! <br>  The screen has Pentile technology, many people praise it, and many scold it.  Personally, I scold her and I think this is the main drawback of the phone.  I will not breed Holivar about Pentile, just because many people like it. <br>  In the sun and in clear weather, the screen reads well, there is enough brightness.  Viewing angles are also sufficient for comfortable work. <br>  The sensor is responsive and does not cause complaints, the screen takes up to 4 touches. <br>  In general, everything is on the level, everything is done as it should. <br><br><h4>  Performance </h4><br>  As I said, the Droid 3 has 2 cores of 1 GHz and a video accelerator PowerVR SGX540. <br>  I did not notice the increase in the speed of work in Android itself or programs, if we compare it with the same Galaxy S. However, in the browser 2 cores make themselves felt: flash, scripts, Java, etc., work a level faster.  In games, Droid behaves very well and wins the performance of all single-core gadgets.  But it is not prohibitively powerful, SGS II is faster.  Although I think a person who buys a Motorola Droid 3 will not play games day and night.  This phone is still more business class. <br>  Yesterday I tried a few of the most demanding games, everything goes smoothly and smartly.  So far, nothing slows down. <br>  QuadRant test: <br> <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/689/snap20110928014223.png/"><img src="http://img689.imageshack.us/img689/7647/snap20110928014223.th.png"></a> <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  We have an eight megapixel camera that can shoot video in FullHD.  What can I say, look at the pictures / video and decide for yourself.  I am more than satisfied with the quality.  For comparison, the Nokia N8 with 12 megapixels, the quality is noticeably worse. <br>  Text.  It was shot in the twilight without a flash, slightly missed the white balance. <br> <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/233/20110927090400162.jpg/"><img src="http://img233.imageshack.us/img233/9995/20110927090400162.th.jpg"></a> <br>  Darkness, almost nothing is visible.  With flash.  Hike missed autofocus. <br> <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/16/20110927120951740.jpg/"><img src="http://img16.imageshack.us/img16/8553/20110927120951740.th.jpg"></a> <br>  Street, day.  It's all good, even very. <br> <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/15/20110927160802546.jpg/"><img src="http://img15.imageshack.us/img15/4391/20110927160802546.th.jpg"></a> <br>  Semi-macro shooting on the street. <br> <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/706/20110927161215435.jpg/"><img src="http://img706.imageshack.us/img706/8775/20110927161215435.th.jpg"></a> <br>  Shooting in motion (PS My favorite beer :)) <br> <a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/99/20110927170929467.jpg/"><img src="http://img99.imageshack.us/img99/6295/20110927170929467.th.jpg"></a> <br>  An example of shooting a video in the afternoon on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOIBNDkqaM4s">YouTube</a> . <br><br><h4>  WiFi, GPS and all kinds of thingies </h4><br>  Wifi works as it should, does not fall off, connects without problems.  The signal level at a level better than the N900 will be.  For example, if in the far room from the hallway (where there is a router) on n900 it does not catch, then on Droid 3 a signal is about 30%. <br>  GPS also works well, cold start is again faster than on the N900.  But the ‚Äúhot‚Äù start was not very pleased with me, whether the place was such that it was really inhibited. <br>  The light sensor and proximity sensor work as they should. <br>  <u>About ryushechkah.</u> <br>  The droid has a LED for notifications.  It may be green, red, blue / blue.  incredibly handy thing, albeit simple.  I liked that he is in a visible place.  And not like in HTC Desire Z, if someone does not know, this LED is located inside the conversational speaker and is practically invisible. <br>  Another very pleasant and useless thing is the HDMI output, maybe someone will need it, but I have not had to use it yet.  The lock / on button is on the top of the device, this is not very convenient.  It would be much better if it was closer to the right side of the phone.  That is, like iphone, desire, etc. <br><br><h4>  Software </h4><br>  The default in the droid is a proprietary motorola shell - MotoBlur.  At first glance, pretty, but enjoy it is not convenient.  There are many small shoals. <br>  Initially, there is VERY a lot of ‚Äúextra‚Äù software, basically this is a software from Verizon calendar / music / gallery, Facbook authorization, MySpace, etc. are also standard ... I have removed about 25 ‚Äúextra‚Äù applications.  What is most interesting when they turn on the phone are loaded and thereby clog the memory. <br>  Since Motorola has blocked its bootloader, we unfortunately will not see custom firmware for which a custom kernel is required, that is, beloved by me and many Cyanogenmod. <br><br><h4>  Working hours </h4><br>  Honestly, I did not have time to torment him much, I have it all the third day.  But I can say with confidence that it will be enough for a day! <br>  This morning I went to school with full charge.  About 20-30 minutes of talking, hours of toys, picking hours in the menu :), about a half to two hours of surfing the Internet and by 8 pm I still had 20 percent of the battery.  The screen was on auto brightness. <br><br><h3>  Summarize </h3><br>  Motorola Droid 3 as a forbidden fruit in our country, get it a little difficult and adapt to our country and language, too.  But when you do this you get the best qwerty slider on android.  As a fan of push-button phones and qwerty keyboards, I was extremely happy when I found out that a dual-core qwerty slider will be released.  Let me explain why I was elated.  Nokia N900 was already falling apart, and Desire Z did not have enough power to work at the same comfortable level that I worked on the N900.  After I read the characteristics of the Droid 3, I realized that this phone was created for me and I should get it at any cost.  I‚Äôll say once again what I got, and this is a 4-inch qHD screen, a smart qwerty keyboard in 5 rows, a powerful dual-core processor, and a great rigorous design. <br>  Just above, I wrote about the difficulties with this phone, and more specifically, I meant it: <br>  -Droid 3 is locked under Verizon, it will have to be unlocked.  And not every phone can be unlocked. <br>  -English cla-ra, for whom it is a minus, for whom it is not.  On the contrary, I am pleased to look at it without Russian letters. <br>  -Particle Russification.  The device can be Russified, but not completely.  It will also have a little perverted, that would make writing physical.  keyboard by the way. <br>  - Frankly speaking, he does not catch the net very well, he has to dance with a tambourine, making connection tweaks.  The signal level gets better, but not much.  The same N900 or Galaxy S catch an order of magnitude better.  Although this does not prevent me from calling or surfing the Internet, if I‚Äôm interested in the comments I will tell you in detail about this. <br><br>  That's basically all, I apologize for finishing the review on the minuses of the phone, but they still had to be voiced :) <br>  As you already understood, I am very pleased with the device and VERY pleased.  Better, perhaps, I have not seen anything. <br>  I will be glad to answer any questions in the comments. <br>  I apologize for having so few photos.  I am now in the country and I distribute the Internet from the N900 to a computer, you understand no speed. <br>  Thanks to all. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129282/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129282/</a></p>
