      The device will start shipping in the second quarter of 2012 in the turquoise, pink, white and black cases for about 200 euros. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Nokia Lumia 900 </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/329/2a1/fb8/3292a1fb86e284d1a209d8ef63ea29b4.jpg" align="left">  Presented (and won a number of awards) at the Consumer Electronic Show 2012 smartphone Nokia Lumia 900 will be available outside the United States with the support of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-Cell_HSDPA">Carrier HSPA</a> .  Lumia 900 will be delivered in white, blue and black color - including in Russia. <br><br>  The smartphone Lumia 900 is equipped with a processor with a frequency of 1.4 GHz, 512 MB of RAM, a 4.3-inch ClearBlack AMOLED-display with a resolution of 800 √ó 480 pixels, front and rear cameras, as well as increased battery capacity compared to Nokia Lumia 800 1830 mAh, providing the device with up to 7 hours of talk time and up to 300 hours of standby time. <br><br>  Just like the Nokia Lumia 610, the Lumia 900 will be available in the second quarter of this year. <br><br><br><br><br><h5>  Nokia Asha 302, 203 and 202 </h5><br>  Nokia Asha phones were created primarily for emerging markets (India, China, Mexico, a number of CIS countries, and so on) to fill the niche of cheap, but functional devices.  The Asha series phones were already on the market - now it has been replenished with three more devices. <br><br><h6>  Nokia Asha 302 </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/60b/888/b67/60b888b67792d1342e1c9649ec6b31cc.jpg" align="right">  The Nokia Asha 302 is the most advanced handset in the Nokia Asha series with a physical QWERTY keyboard and full Microsoft Exchange support.  Mobile office applications are installed on the phone, there are physical buttons for quick access to e-mail and calendar. <br><br>  The Nokia Asha 302 is the first Nokia Series 40 phone to introduce Mail for Exchange support.  For users, this means the ability to quickly connect your phone to the Microsoft Exchange mail server and set up synchronization with mail, calendars and address book. <br><br>  The phone is equipped with a 3.2 megapixel camera, an FM receiver, a microSD card reader with a size of up to 32 GB and a WiFi module.  The battery provides a talk time of up to 9 hours and a standby time of up to 29 days. <br><br><h6>  Nokia Asha 203 </h6><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d2/010/e98/2d2010e98635ff07a40a965f0abf3d5e.jpg" align="right">  Unlike the Nokia Asha 302, this phone is designed to communicate in social networks and games.  The phone comes with an exclusive package of games from Electronic Arts in the amount of 40 pieces, which can be downloaded from the Nokia Store. <br><br>  The phone has a built-in player audio and video files, FM-receiver and 2-megapixel camera for making video calls.  The phone‚Äôs free memory is only 10 MB, but it supports microSD cards up to 32 GB in size.  Despite the fact that the weight of the device is only 90 grams, this baby with a touch screen works up to 5 hours in talk mode and up to 25 days in standby mode. <br><br><h6>  Nokia Asha 202 </h6><br>  The Nokia Asha 202 is a dual SIM-enabled phone that allows you to easily switch between them if necessary.  All multimedia features are similar to those available in the Nokia Asha 203. Moreover, the appearance of the Nokia Asha 202 is also no different from the Nokia Asha 203, except that there is no camera in it.  The phone weighs 90 grams and can last from one charge to 5 hours in talk mode and up to 16 days in standby mode. <br><br>  All three models will appear in Russia in the second quarter of this year. <br><br><h4>  Services </h4><br><h5>  Nokia Maps for Nokia Lumia </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fd5/229/014/fd5229014227bad6da4b2ff964d1ce7a.jpg" align="left">  Nokia has introduced a new version of the Nokia Maps application.  Having listened to user feedback, we refined the application interface so that the user displays all the necessary information about the route and does not display unnecessary and unnecessary details. <br><br>  Social functions appeared in the application: after the upgrade, users will be able to create favorite places, as well as view the history of visited establishments.  This data can be easily shared with friends via SMS, email and social networks. <br><br>  An update will be available in the coming weeks. <br><br><br><br><h5>  Nokia Navigator </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/964/640/278/96464027874caed1958923b3038da7bc.jpg" align="right">  Nokia Navigator, as we promised, acquired full-fledged offline support.  In the updated version of the application, location search, route construction, prompt change of the destination and navigation itself will work without access to the Network. <br><br>  The updated Nokia Navigator application displays pre-notifications about road congestion and automatically paves the way for traffic jams.  The application interface has been changed to display the current speed in real time and warn you about speed limits, show the distance to the destination point and the estimated time of arrival. <br><br>  Any destination can be quickly added to favorites so that it can also be quickly displayed on the screen.  To be precise, in two clicks. <br><br>  Nokia Navigator update will also appear in the coming weeks. <br><br><h5>  Nokia Public Transport </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/4de/296/1d7/4de2961d70833be73ec5b9f7538a5222.jpg" align="left">  Nokia Public Transport is another application, this time designed for public transport users.  Nokia Public Transport displays up-to-date information on land and underground transport routes, reporting the departure time of the bus, tram, train, and even the subway you need.  The application takes into account the subtleties and nuances of transfers and transitions. <br><br>  Nokia Public Transport will operate in more than 45 countries and will cover 500 large cities around the world.  In Russia, the service will begin work this year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/138972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/138972/</a></p>
