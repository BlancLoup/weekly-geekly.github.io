This would be useful for our company, as employees are often abroad, but should stay in touch. <br>  - <br>  <em>If this is interesting, somehow I can describe in more detail my search for replacing ms word, exel, leaving the exchange server, and even searching for the browser alternative icq, which would store the complete message history.</em> <br><br>  There were many solutions of different scale, quality and state of readiness, but because of their fragmentation, the future costs of introducing and resolving convenience and compatibility issues were obvious, as well as training employees in new principles and overcoming their natural rejection reaction. <br><br>  After a long search, I finally managed to find a company that would have a full range of products of interest to me. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/b42/226/4b0/b422264b07678ddcdba0394a0dab9db8.jpg" width="137" height="48" hspace="10" vspace="10">

      <a href="http://zoho.com/">ZOHO</a> currently stands out in the young web application market in terms of the number of its solutions and the degree of their readiness for business. <br><br>  Today they offer 12 solutions that are complemented by three utilities and a good API. <br><br>  I will describe them a little further by translating their own annotations and adding my comments. <br><br>  <strong>Zoho writer</strong> <br>  Full replacement for MsWord.  It features a very user-friendly interface and interesting features such as tags that you can write to documents. <br>  Does not require installation, does not require downloading, just ask to register. <br><br>  <strong>Zoho Projects</strong> <br>  Application for project management. <br>  The free version allows you to create 1 project, manage and interact with other users online. <br>  Ask for $ 5 per month for each next project.  I'd add from myself that this should be good for working with a project, the main part of which is an online outsourcing team.  Enjoyed and very satisfied. <br>  <strong>Zoho sheet</strong> <br>  These are their spreadsheets.  I want to note that they provide applications with some functions that are inherited from the web.  You will not meet them anywhere. <br><br>  <strong>Zoho CRM</strong> <br>  Customer Relationship Management application.  Compared to Microsoft‚Äôs Dynamics, the cost of implementation is significantly lower (I think, dozens of times). <br>  This is their main application, which I widely used.  These guys are so cool that the only thing that worried me was the heads of my employees, the sales process and how to properly transfer it to CRM and implement it.  There are even the beginnings of artificial intelligence in this system: it can send you messages of a custom format if it ‚Äúfinds out‚Äù the situation that you have laid in it (the pattern).  For example, when the probability of making a deal is below 50%, and the turnover is more than $ 10,000, I received a letter asking me to control the situation.  On the benefits and disadvantages of CRM-systems can also tell a lot, and if necessary, I will reveal this topic.  In conclusion, I would say that the system in circulation and configuration is very elegant, but at the beginning of 2007 there was no Russian localization.  Yes, it's free for three users, the rest is 12 bucks per person per month. <br>  <strong>Zoho Show</strong> <br>  Analogue Powerpoint.  ‚ÄúA tool for creating, modifying, publishing, and showing presentations,‚Äù says the caption below.  Free. <br><br>  <strong>Zoho Creator</strong> <br>  One of the most interesting applications.  This is the thing that allows you to make an online database, and there is a designer-generator interfaces and an external API.  I played for a long time, until I wanted non-standard interfaces.  In general, this is Access for the Web, which as a phenomenon will very soon turn into a number of interesting things for you and me;) <br><br>  <strong>Zoho Meeting</strong> <br>  Analogue NetMeeting.  Conferences, meetings, remote assistance. <br><br>  <strong>Zoho wiki</strong> <br>  Wiki for workgroups.  Come and see it is worth it.  These guys invented a lot of useful things. <br><br>  <strong>Zoho Notebook (beta)</strong> <br>  Content aggregator of different types.  I must see, I can not describe it.  But obviously, they will gradually build their own web-desktop in it, where they will place all the applications. <br><br>  <strong>Zoho chat</strong> <br>  Chat with tuning for business.  There are also groups.  Free. <br><br>  <strong>Zoho planner</strong> <br>  Organizer.  Very reminiscent of Ms Outlook for feature set. <br><br>  <strong>Zoho Mail (private beta)</strong> <br>  And here is the postal service.  It supports documents, has a calendar, sends your letters.  If you do not represent the company, it will be free for you. <br><br>  <strong>U now have a utility</strong> <br><br>  <strong>Zoho Challenge</strong> <br>  Allows you to post vacancies and arrange a selection of applicants online.  Free for 25 candidates. <br><br>  <strong>Zoho Polls</strong> <br>  Voting for the site. <br><br>  <strong>Site 24x7</strong> <br>  Follow your site.  Able to check the availability, as well as the availability of specific information. <br><br>  To summarize, I‚Äôll say that they have everything in Java, and also these insidious guys have released a plug-in for Microsoft Office. <br>  By the way, this is an Indian company.
