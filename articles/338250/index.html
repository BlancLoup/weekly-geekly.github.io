  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Talk about Virtual Reality. Conversation number 2. Practical about virtuality</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Conversation number 1 can refresh in memory by clicking on the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/336460/">link</a> <br><blockquote>  Illusions attract us that relieve pain, and as a replacement bring pleasure. <br>  For this we must accept without complaint, when, in conflict with a part of reality, illusions are shattered. <br>  Sigmund Freud <br></blockquote><h2>  III Using Virtual Reality </h2><br>  In the first part, we identified the main properties and characteristics of the actors and the environment of the Virtual Reality phenomenon, interpreting this phenomenon more widely than Wikipedia and other modern sources.  We assumed that it was an artificial reality created, not only by technical means, but an Illusion in general.  At least, this concept was interpreted in the precomputer era. <br><br>  Now let's collect and analyze information, for which people resort to its ‚Äúuse‚Äù, which doses are safe, do not cause addiction and side effects. <br><br><h3>  1. Immersion in a comfortable illusion, invented by someone </h3><br>  And when did we first encounter the sensations of a non-existent world?  Perhaps this is still a fairy tale, which we read in childhood.  For a long time, experiencing the need to at least temporarily escape from the cruel reality, into another: happy, fair and comfortable, people came up with fairy tales.  Although in fairness, it should be noted that some of them have the opposite effect.  Plunging into horrors and sufferings, a man bursting back into objective reality, realizes that life, compared with feelings, is not so terrible, but quite tolerable, and he is not bad enough, but what‚Äôs there - just lucky and everything.  And even having matured, people do not cease to need fairy tales.  So he pulls in the phrase ‚Äúsome goats use this ...‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Another fairy tale mission is the opportunity to gain life experience, and the use of imaginary (Virtual) images helps to enhance the experience and speed up the learning process.  And since childhood we know exactly how to properly dispose of desires, if we accidentally catch a goldfish, from which it is necessary to build houses so that a passing wolf could not destroy them.  Now I thought: strange, but for some reason we have got the widest experience of dealing with wolves since childhood.  Well, never mind the point.  Jokes are jokes, but there are people whom fairy tales have pushed to bring their happy stories to life, one way or another, having corrected their reality.  At the same time, sometimes they did not even realize that it was just a fairy tale, and one should not even try to reproduce it.

      Based on the concept presented in the first conversation - a fairy tale model may look like this <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/616/9ff/d09/6169ffd0963c4947a948f6b49ae7412e.jpg"><br><br><h3>  2. Recreation of lost artifacts and events over time </h3><br>  The next utility, lying on the surface, is well known to everyone, and therefore we will touch on it only lapidarily.  It is connected with the fact that everything in life dies: people, traditions, buildings, whole cities and even civilizations.  And to help not to lose the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthem completely and irrevocably, perhaps only Virtual Reality allows.  After all, with the help of artificial reconstruction of such illusions, you can simulate the details, knowledge of which has already been lost.  But here it is important not to overdo it with speculation and gag.  Therefore, it can be argued that one of the most widely used assignments of Virtual Reality is the re-creation of lost artifacts and events over time. <br><br><h3>  3. Building an illusion of your ideal world </h3><br>  What else?  Most likely, each of you at least once in your life met people about whom they say: ‚Äúthey live in their own world.‚Äù  This may be the world of "wizards and fairies", "puppy love for all", "faith in universal justice", etc.  In this case, we are not talking about phobias such as ‚Äúa general conspiracy against me‚Äù dictated by some negative life experience, but about a person‚Äôs desire to escape from the reality of his being, which does not suit him and which he cannot change.  A typical example of existence in such an imaginary world can be emphasized from the film ‚ÄúIn love at will‚Äù, when the heroine reasons: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúLook: he is bored riding and looking bored.  Do he understand that he is the chosen one!  the chosen one of the universe! "..." I am never alone.  Here, for example, now I think about some person.  After all, he now, this minute, does something, lives.  And I thought about him and intermarried.  We are twinned with the simultaneous existence of existence. ‚Äù </blockquote>  This film was shot back in the pre-computer era.  And in our age, all-consuming computer games and social networks are pulling in to cover up problems with such an imaginary world.  With such, you do not even have to strain your imagination - put flabby muscles in a chair at the computer, and now you are already a superhero, throwing monsters out of the monitor.  Or handsome, carelessly sharing with others, his countless victories on the love front.  All this in white, on a white camel, behind a white grand piano ... well, handsome, agree.  From this we can conclude: that the claimed role of Virtual reality in a person‚Äôs life is the opportunity to feel yourself without any special physical force by someone else - ideal, or in some other ideal environment.  This phenomenon has also manifested itself from ancient times, which Oscar Wilde perfectly noted in his phrase: ‚ÄúA person feels uncomfortable when he speaks about himself.  Give him a mask, and he will tell you the whole truth. " <br><br>  It was this kind of mask that gave us social networks, which became the indispensable ‚Äúsolved‚Äù of this kind of problems.  The purpose of using this technique is to hide your physical and sometimes spiritual identity.  Pretend to be another person in order to deceive another, and more often to deceive yourself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/a98/b89/401/a98b894012b64d57810ba180ed209fac.jpg"><br><br>  Social networks are implementing another phenomenon that American psychiatrist Arnold M. Ludwig has successfully considered in his writings. This is social cohesion. With this tool, the world began to change much faster.  Recently, it has increasingly become a weapon in the fight against someone with someone.  But this topic is somehow scary to even raise.  When I wrote in my <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/335408/">article</a> about the tools for creating the ‚ÄúSocial Body‚Äù, I was accused of ‚Äúconcocting‚Äù instructions for creating a sect.  But to keep silent about it, I also could not. <br><br><h3>  4. Imitation of dangerous situations to gain experience </h3><br>  To draw attention to the manifestation of yet another purpose of Virtual Reality, the thought of the great philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche helped me.  He wrote: "Unfulfilled is much more important than what happened ...".  But the unfulfilled, as we understand, is not and never was, and the only environment of its existence is Virtual reality.  That it allows you to simulate situations and look beyond the foreseeable, avoiding the negative consequences in the real world.  A person gains experience by learning from his own - "alien" (virtual) mistakes.  This saves you from one of the worst mistakes in life - constantly afraid to make a mistake.  And you can, like in the movie ‚ÄúGroundhog Day‚Äù, try to change the storyline over and over again and watch from the inside what it will lead to. <br><br>  In addition, if we take as a basis the assumption of Alexei Tolstoy that: ‚ÄúHappiness is pleasure without repentance.‚Äù, Then the Virtual world is capable of making us happy, eliminating the need to repent from the scheme. <br><br>  This is a very useful and difficult to replace by other means, the purpose of Virtual reality. <br><br><h3>  5. Virtualization of business processes </h3><br>  And recently, e-government has been very pleased, of course virtual.  For example, the sites of "public services".  What are they fast, polite and helpful - these "public services".  They will listen in silence and never slaughter, while you scribble an angry letter to them, splashing saliva from an oversupply of feelings, experiencing such personal dislike for those others - quite real, irresponsible idlers, ruining your life.  Yes, that only you - everyone around.  I filed a complaint or, for example, an application for a certificate, a document, the right to do anything, but what else.  And you wait ... No, not in the queue in the flea market and the hubbub, but at home on a couch, with a cup of coffee, to whom the doctor of course permits.  And bluescreen in the computer, and you know - a message has come, and there is already a ready answer, explanation, resolution, well, in a pinch, a failure.  But also very polite, with explanations of course, apologies, as they say, and so it happened. <br><br>  And why is everything so awesome?  Yes, they simply excluded a person from some of the chains of the sovereign‚Äôs affairs, replacing them with Virtual reality, which is not so sensitive, irritable and emotional.  Which over time, does not think of itself as irreplaceable and will not begin to be rude and demand respect for oneself as an individual. <br><br><h3>  6. Virtualization of mutual settlements </h3><br>  Another rapidly growing manifestation of Virtual Reality is Virtual (or electronic) money.  They can be exchanged according to the rules of the Central Bank, and according to the rules of various private electronic payment systems.  But here it is worth noting that one of the main signs of the legitimacy of a currency is the status of legal payment money, which none of the virtual currencies currently possess. <br><br>  The essence of using this virtuality is that a certain organization (issuer) issues an analogue of money, respectively virtual, and sells them to afflicted users, for real money.  Those can make the agreed purchases on them, from the agreed sellers, having paid off with virtual cash.  The seller, in turn, with the received electronic money turns back to the issuer who issued them and extinguishes them, converting them into real money.  There are electronic checks and other virtual settlements. <br><br>  For those who have never worked with this, the question may arise: "Why is it so difficult?"  Here, the benefit is achieved mainly (but not only) by minimizing the costs of banking system operations.  They interact, roughly speaking, twice in the scheme.  The first time buying electronic money, and the second - converting them back into real.  And between these two events, you can make many purchases without using banking transactions.  It turns out so to speak duty-free zone - a la duty free. <br><br>  And here it is appropriate to recall the example of life, the use of virtual (though not electronic) money in the pre-Internet era.  Somehow in the 90s there was not enough money for everyone, and they somehow depreciated very quickly and in this connection, they were increasingly lacking.  What came up with the bright minds of the then modernity?  When employees of the plant traveled to a factory dispensary located in another region, they were given coupons to visit a bar with the use of alcoholic beverages.  What is not virtual money?  Such will not fail.  After all, they are: firstly, it can be used only for its intended purpose, the wife will not select cosmetics, secondly, they will not lose in purchasing power due to inflation. <br><br><h3>  7. Section Summary </h3><br>  As a result, we managed to highlight the following need to use Virtual Reality: <br><br><ol><li>  Recreation of lost artifacts and events over time; </li><li>  The acquisition of their own experience, based on other people's ideas, often hypertrophied, to enhance the effect; </li><li>  Creating an alternative, more comfortable world around you that helps you feel happier than in real life; </li><li>  The possibility of anonymous communication, allowing you to hide your physical identity, and sometimes spiritual.  Allows you to pretend to be another person, reduce vulnerability; </li><li>  Simulation of various dangerous situations that could occur in real life, to prevent their negative consequences in the real world and to choose the best solutions to problems; </li><li>  Creating an illusion, deception, in order to mislead people, for some selfish purposes; </li><li>  The substitution of a person in business processes, allowing to exclude the negative manifestations of his weaknesses and vices; </li><li>  Exclusion from the settlement of official financial institutions to minimize the cost of their services. </li></ol><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Bibliography</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  1.
