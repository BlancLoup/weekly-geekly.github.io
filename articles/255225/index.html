  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interview with skype-cheater</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A few days ago, Sergei Share <a href="http://sergeydolya.livejournal.com/938717.html">told</a> about how fraudsters hacked his friend's Skype, started sending messages on the contact list with a request to transfer money.  Within a few hours, the attackers, according to the estimates of Doli himself, managed to get more than 250,000 rubles.  This is also <a href="http://tjournal.ru/paper/dolya-skype-hack">tjournal</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/baa/c80/3ab/baac803aba004946b9d027b7168641d4.jpg"><br><br>  The scheme of divorce is not new.  One of the most famous stories on this topic was <a href="http://pikabu.ru/story/ostorozhno_moshenniki_v_skaype_1367856">described</a> almost two years ago.  I am ashamed to admit, but about a year ago I myself became a victim of the same (the same?) Scammers.  One of the old acquaintances, from whom nothing had been heard for a long time, suddenly wrote a request to transfer some money, because "it is very necessary."  Yes, yes, I know, "as it is possible," "well, what a goof," and all that.  In general, just wish you not to fall.

      But just a few days ago, another of my contacts, with whom I had not corresponded for a long time, wrote unexpectedly and ... yes, I asked for a loan of several thousand.  This time I, of course, understood everything from the first two phrases, but decided not to kill the intrigue, but to have a little fun.  However, nothing funny came of it.  I was wondering what the crook would do when he discovered that nothing had come to his account, although the victim had confirmed the translation.  In fact, it turned out that a person from the other side cannot always check the account for which he asks to throw money. <br><br>  From the article Share I remember a screenshot in which one of his friends asks scammers to give an interview, and they refuse.  Well, once I had such a chance, I also decided to ask for an interview.  Unexpectedly, I managed to get answers to many interesting questions.  Below I give our dialogue in a minor artistic treatment. <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  It is clear that it doesn‚Äôt bother with a full-fledged interview; to disprove. </blockquote><br><br><h4>  Divorce </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/be4/85a/05d/be485a05d32e4eada3ae6cef263a8377.png"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dcf/13b/923/dcf13b92360343f185bd1781dd42203e.png"><br><br><h4>  Interview </h4><br>  After making sure that I will not be able to play the cheater, I ask for an interview. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/418/305/e16/418305e167534efba6354eac803bc761.png"><br><br>  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt have time to take all the screenshots (the owner has now restored access, and, for some reason, all the correspondence has disappeared until a certain moment, the last part of the ‚Äúinterview‚Äù is still in place); about the interviews have become frequent, and they are tired, wow.  He crumples a little, but eventually agrees. <br><br><h4>  About work" </h4><br>  <b>- How many people do you have?</b> <br>  - To the people - 11 offices, 7 in the Russian Federation and 4 more across the CIS.  How many people in each office - I do not know.  In ours - 7, but in shifts.  I saw two more people, if their change is the same, then we have a total of 14. <br><br>  <b>- How is anonymity ensured?</b> <br>  - From what I know: there is a proxy and VPN, and somehow there is a connection through Dedik. <br><br>  <b>- How are hacked accounts?</b>  <b>Who is doing this?</b> <br>  - Akki are gone xs like, they just give us. <br><br>  <b>- And the wallets for which the money flows, are they also stolen?</b> <br>  - Merge only those that give us.  I do not know where they are from. <br><br>  <b>- That is, your task is only to correctly dilute?</b>  <b>What kind of psychology operators?</b> <br>  - Exactly.  They are allowed into the office only after reading two books on psychology.  The sucker is not a mammoth, the sucker will not die out. <br>  <b>- With this, unfortunately, can not argue.</b> <br>  - That's how we live. <br><br>  <b>- And there is such a layout, when people can not throw at kiwi, but maybe, say, at the POISON.</b>  <b>Then he is asked to throw at the poison of another victim, and already this one is asked to throw at kiwi.</b>  <b>Often it happens?</b>  <b>Is it difficult to synchronize the two victims?</b> <br>  - No, we also have Poisons, it‚Äôs just more expensive to personalize them, therefore we are less likely to give them away.  Well, in general, the decree is such that it is better not to translate them. <br>  <b>- Apparently, the last time I came across a competing organization.</b> <br><br><h4>  About money </h4><br>  <b>- How do you get your salary?</b> <br>  - Cashless. <br>  <b>- Depends on the volume of "profits"?</b> <br>  - Of course, directly. <br>  <b>- Can you at least call the order?</b>  <b>Tens of thousands, hundreds?</b> <br>  - 100 thousand per month and free.  40% to you.  If more than 100 per month - 50% goes, but over 14 thousand from one victim cannot be taken, and more than 200 thousand per month is also impossible. <br>  <b>- And why the upper monthly limit?</b>  <b>What is the point?</b>  <b>Are you afraid that you get rich and fall down too quickly?</b> <br>  - No, I think there they just have some limits on cashing in.  Therefore limit. <br><br><h4>  About security </h4><br>  <b>- There is no fear that they will catch?</b>  <b>Does the employer somehow guarantee safety?</b> <br>  - I think those security measures that they arrange are enough.  In any case, if that - we are under pressure.  If you don't work, they will find something for you.  Or do something ... I do not want about it now. <br><br>  <b>- Is this the main job?</b>  <b>Or just as a side job?</b> <br>  - A side job that goes into the main, if you work well. <br>  <b>- Well, 50% with a maximum of 200k is 100k per month.</b>  <b>It does not sound like a good salary for this kind of activity, I think.</b> <br>  - Well, yes, rather, part-time. <br><br><h4>  Subtleties </h4><br>  <b>- But in fact, the most interesting thing that I always wanted to ask: when you get Skype account, do you read the previous correspondence in order to better join the conversation?</b>  <b>In order not to sleep on some personal trifles or something?</b> <br>  - Depending on Skype.  If you can see that a good result is possible, then you can spend a little time and get a grasp. <br>  <b>- And how is it seen?</b> <br>  - By the names of contacts, Skype history, etc. <br>  <b>- Can you give an example, if not difficult?</b>  <b>How can one understand by names whether a person has money or not?</b>  <b>I can assume that it is easy to distinguish schoolchildren by nicknames, and they are more likely to be insolvent.</b>  <b>Something like this?</b> <br>  - First name, middle name, last name - it looks more serious than ‚ÄúKatya‚Äù, ‚ÄúMasha‚Äù, ‚ÄúDasha‚Äù, ‚ÄúSanja‚Äù. <br>  <b>- Damn, we urgently need to change the data in Skype.</b> <br>  - Subscribe "maxim", and everything will be good: D <br>  <b>- A better something like Uni4t0ZHitel2001, yes?</b> <br>  - Ooh yeah.  And the date of birth in Skype take away. <br><br><h4>  Labor productivity </h4><br>  <b>- How many conversations do you have about at the same time?</b> <br>  - Differently) It depends on how they respond.  Somewhere from 3 to 20. <br>  <b>- Is there a record?</b>  <b>20 really was?</b> <br>  - There was more.  For example, 170 contacts, 70 of them online, 30 of them answered immediately.  But many are quickly eliminated. <br><br>  <b>- What is the average percentage of successful distribution?</b>  <b>From the number of respondents, let's say.</b>  <b>Well, that is, there was a dialogue with 30 contacts, of which 10 transferred money, then there would be 33%.</b> <br>  - It is very dependent on the audience. <br>  <b>- Well, let's say that you think a successful result?</b>  <b>ten%?</b>  <b>20, 50?</b> <br>  - Success is not a percentage, but in the amount of money.  Therefore, the interest is meaningless. <br><br><h4>  Future plans </h4><br>  <b>- How long do you plan to do this?</b>  <b>Any other plans for the future?</b> <br>  - I think if I collect enough capital, I will go into white threads.  Hopefully soon, by the summer. <br>  <b>- And what is the experience already?</b> <br>  - Half a year. <br><br><h4>  Work searches" </h4><br>  <b>- Found this job on the ad?</b>  <b>Or through a friend?</b>  <b>How does this even happen?</b> <br>  - Announcement. <br>  <b>- How is the job description coded in the ad?</b>  <b>You immediately realized that there is something else?</b> <br>  - This is impossible to assume ... I can not talk to you, I'm sorry. <br>  <b>- Ok, thanks for the answers!</b>  <b>There will be a case - write more from other accounts.</b> <br>  - You have more than 230 contacts, so it is possible.  Goodbye. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/255225/">https://habr.com/ru/post/255225/</a></p>
