Yes, yes it is SHASHKI, but you are mistaken, this game is a chess type.  Before us is the classic confrontation of two armies of figures of different ranks. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many European researchers call this game the CHINESE CHESS, which in my opinion is not quite right.  This is SYANZI, a Chinese chess game with a centuries-old history and unique originality. <br>  Western researchers usually view Siangqi as one of the branches of the development of a class of games rooted in chaturanga (chaturanga).  According to this version, it is believed that chaturanga (chaturanga) is the common ancestor of all the chess-type games now known.  Moving westward, shaturanga (chaturanga) gave rise to the Arab Shatranj, which became the ancestor of modern classical chess.  Spreading to the east and entering China, the shaturanga (chaturanga), and perhaps even the shatranj, have changed in accordance with Chinese traditions and turned into Xiangqi. <br>  Here is how Robert Bell describes the emergence and design of the game in his book: ‚ÄúShatrange in a new form has undergone significant changes, and already elephants, horsemen, infantrymen, a cannon with battle chariots fought to capture an enemy general.  Each army had a fortress, sitting in which the general and his mandarins hatched their plans.  To win the party, it was necessary to take the fortress of the enemy by storm.  Between the two armies flowed a river, which the heavily loaded elephants could not overcome.  Other light figures forced it free. ‚Äù <br>  Chinese researchers categorically disagree with the theory of the origin of the SYNCI from the chaturangi (chaturangi).  Based on documents, the oldest of which date from the Han era, they argue that the game, which became the ancestor of the Xiangqi, appeared in ancient China about 3,500 years ago and was originally called ANYONE.  In this game, chips were also moved around the board, among which were pawns and a general with different rules of the turn, but used the dice to determine the course, thus introducing an element of randomness into the game.  Just like the progenitor of the shaturangi (chaturangi), the game was TAAYAM.  Later, the bones were abandoned, having received the game GUUILI SAIJAN. <br>  In the Tang era, the rules of the game were modified, and the variety of shapes increased, which led to the appearance of the rules of the syangs, which are close to modern ones.  It was definitely proved that in the 8th century in China, the SYANZI existed, two players played in them, the dice were no longer used, and the set of figures corresponded to a set of figures of a shaturanga (chaturanga) - a general (king), a horse, an elephant, a chariot (rook) and soldiers (pawns). <br>  So consider the game itself. <br>  The board for the game of SYANZI consists of two halves with squares of 8 to 4, which are separated by a space of one square width, known as the River (or POND).  Each half of the board has four squares, marked by diagonals, thus formed by a square of nine points is a FORTRESS (LOCK).  When playing, the pieces are placed at the intersections of the lines, and not in the squares themselves.  Therefore, the board is considered as one large space of dots in the amount of 9 by 10.

On the upper side of the figure is written its meaning.  Typically, inscriptions are made in red and green (sometimes black) color.  When writing equivalent figures, different Chinese characters are used to designate them, for example, if on some figures the inscriptions were in English, and on others - in German. <br>  The following pieces are presented on the game board in SYANCI (taking into account the rules of their movement during the turn): <br>  GENERAL for "green" ("black") / MARSHAL for red - a figure similar to the chess ROI, losing it means losing the player in the game.  It can move one point in a vertical or horizontal direction, but in its movements it is limited to nine points of its strength (castle).  The generals cannot face each other (when there are no figures along the vertical line between them), in this case, in response to the move that freed the line, the general can attack through the whole field and kill the enemy general with his "look" (a very funny rule with an oriental flavor, shots from Chinese historical films with piercing glances of actors playing the role of some generals immediately come to mind). <br>  GOVERNOR for "green" ("black") / MANDARIN for red - the figure can move one point diagonally, but they are also limited in their actions to the limits of the fortress, i.e.  five dots marked with bold lines. <br>  ELEPHANT for "green" ("black") / MINISTER for red - a figure can walk diagonally only on one next point, except this figure cannot cross a river (pond) and invade enemy territory. <br>  RIDER / HORSE - a figure can move one point vertically or horizontally, followed by a diagonal movement to a point.  Unlike a chess knight, a knight in Xiangqi is an ordinary linear figure - during the course he does not ‚Äújump over‚Äù from the starting point to the final one, but moves in the plane of the board, first horizontally or vertically, and then diagonally.  If at the intermediate point of the knight's move is his own figure or opponent's figure, then he blocks the corresponding move. <br>  The WHEELER / BOAT is an analogue of a chess rook, can move any distance vertically or horizontally. <br>  CATAPULTS for "green" ("black") / CUTTER for red - can walk like a chess rook.  It captures the opponent‚Äôs pieces only if there is some third piece between it and the attacked piece, called the screen. <br>  WARRIOR / FOOT - on his side of the board he can walk only vertically one point forward, on the territory of the enemy he can move one point forward or sideways.  When reaching the opponent's back line, can only move horizontally.  The ability to turn into other pieces, as in chess, does not possess. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22a/194/420/22a194420dd147baaa28df2dc78105e8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The goal of the game is to declare a MAT to an enemy general or to achieve a stalemate.  At the same time, the player cannot give an eternal check; he must vary his moves. <br>  The general is under check under the following conditions: <br>  - being attacked by any figure, he can be captured during the next move, if not to take measures to repel an attack on him; <br>  - when the generals confront each other on the same vertical and there are no figures between them (that piercing look). <br>  When declaring a shah to a general, there are three possible answers: <br>  - an attacking general figure can be taken as an opponent figure; <br>  - The general may leave the Shah; <br>  - the check can be turned away using the ‚Äúspecific‚Äù rules for moving the pieces (for example, add / remove the screen in front of the cannon, parry / block the rider). <br>  Unfortunately, in our country and in Europe, Syangci could not achieve great popularity, although it is the most popular game in China (there is a game in almost every home).  But there are objective reasons for this: <br>  First, in order to understand the figures themselves, it is necessary, at least at the initial level, to understand Chinese characters and be able to read the symbols indicated on them. <br>  Secondly, there is practically no translated professional literature on this topic (diverse articles, including this one) will not give full insight into the world of this fascinating game. <br>  Now a lot is being done to popularize this game, for example, you can purchase such a set with figures close to chess. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/84d/d9c/864/84dd9c864a544702a084aaf68ff35643.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Or here is a souvenir set of the game in Syantsi in ethnic style <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/842/76d/5e3/84276d5e38924112ac23f2b9cf45e83f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Before writing this article, I personally ‚Äúmoved‚Äù the open spaces of various markets and found some wonderful simulations of the game in SYANCI for iOS and Android, in order to get an idea about it. <br>  For the sake of interest, I suggest that you enter in the search engine "xianqi", "xianci" or "Xiangqi" to try yourself in this game. <br>  I hope, in view of the growing interaction between Russia and China, more literature will begin to appear in Russian, not only on the history of this game, but also with explanations of the rules and examples of parties. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390131/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390131/</a></p>
