Tables, forms, graphs, maps and charts should make the best use of metaphors, mental images, navigation, interaction and visibility to be practical, useful and attractive, thus following the fundamental fundamentals of positive user experience. <br>  experience.  The emergence of new technologies for searching and collecting information, <br>  recently offered by Google, Yahoo and other major online <br>  companies may be evidence of serious progress.  To a certain degree <br>  This is true, however, many advanced visualization techniques (and sound) <br>  used for years, and in some cases for decades in narrow financial, medical, military and scientific circles, without having received wide recognition and application. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There are plenty of resources about visualizing information.  For example, <br>  Woolman's ‚ÄúDigital Information Graphics‚Äù - richly illustrated catalog <br>  innovation, released around 2002.  Some technologies, such as the Inselberg paradigm of parallel coordinates, which he first showed me at a conference in 1981, have been known for decades.  Professor <br>  Marty Hearst of the University of California at Berkeley, in his course on information visualization, introduces a number of techniques similar to those taught throughout the world.  The latest technology conferences also include <br>  events organized since 1990 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers <br>  electronics (IEEE) and other organizations, for example, the ‚ÄúDiagrams <br>  2006 ‚Äù.  To a certain extent, the visualization of information is strong, <br>  reliable component of the industry.  However, much more needs to be done. <br><br>  <strong>PROGRESS</strong>

      Even today, most users don't have any tools for building <br>  diagrams or data representations as convenient as <br>  text editors or spreadsheets.  This is sad since so many people <br>  most productively express their thoughts in non-verbal ways, in connection with which <br>  clarification processes and descriptions can best be implemented with <br>  using verbal-visual or even verbal-audial, especially dynamic <br>  means.  Of course, many users prefer this diagram <br>  product, like Visio, or one of its components, such as SmartDraw. <br>  However, not all users are familiar with them, besides these applications <br>  incompatible with some platforms. <br><br>  Of course, intelligent general-purpose products are becoming more <br>  advanced and clear, easy to read and use.  James <br>  Fellows describes some of them in a recent article in the New York Times. <br>  He cites as an example Devonthink Professional, an information retrieval <br>  a system that offers simple data entry into the database of electronic messages, <br>  web pages, text and numeric files, images, pdf files and everything that <br>  can be "copied by pressing a key, or moved with a mouse for storage." <br>  It is possible to combine or classify data in the process of their <br>  receipts, or later.  Methods of collecting information through a quick search <br>  similar to Apple Macintosh Spotlight built-in tool, or <br>  Google search bars.  However, a special option here is the "show <br>  also ", pressing which displays files or text semantically related to <br>  search criteria with clearer criteria than most online <br>  search engines.  Another mentioned for its feature, the product has become <br>  Tinderbox, displaying visual links between facts or ideas entered <br>  the user in the form of quotes, themes, phrases, texts, images, diagrams and other <br>  forms.  Thus, it is possible to display extensive data in the form of text, <br>  diagrams, sequence charts or link diagram. <br><br>  Products similar to those listed above, such as a hyperbolic browser from <br>  InXight, the result of previous Xerox PARC developments, and <br>  also an experimental Data Mountain metaphor technology created by <br>  Microsoft developers, mentioned by George Robertson and others, are all <br>  use spatial syntax to display concepts and <br>  relationship.  Many of these techniques are based on a visual image. <br>  without the use of sound.  Individual developers, like Kaper and others, <br>  focused solely on voicing data, and only a few <br>  use both presentation technologies.  Alice Preston and Susan Fowler <br>  investigated sound phenomena at the UPA workshop in 2004 and based on the results <br>  presented a list of great examples.  And although a lot of innovative <br>  approaches to visualization / sound information, none of them received <br>  such global and ubiquitous application that has been achieved to <br>  example, creating spreadsheets in the 80s. <br><br><br><br>  <strong>WHAT'S EXPECTING US?</strong> <br><br>  What will allow to bring these intimate approaches to the mainstream?  How reliable <br>  and a tool compatible with any system will be on everyone‚Äôs computer or <br>  communication device in ten years?  Regardless <br>  what form it will take, it will have to solve a number of problems. <br><br>  When developing new features for popular products, it is always taken in <br>  attention a certain historical precedent.  So word processing, which is already <br>  no longer associated with the traditional printing press, to a large extent <br>  was based on the metaphor of existing mechanical or electromechanical <br>  devices of the previous era.  The same can be said about electronic <br>  tables developed on the basis of ledgers that have been used for centuries <br>  accountants.  Do not forget that after the invention of mobile <br>  letters and typography in his understanding today, Guttenberg and <br>  colleagues were confident that they only improved the process <br>  the creation of manuscripts, in connection with which the essence of their invention, in the scale of the current <br>  his scores remained undisclosed for decades.  What of used in our <br>  days could be the basis for a new method of visualization / sound <br>  information?  Of course, Venn diagrams, flowcharts and other basic <br>  diagram technologies could be a good start. <br><br>  Another challenge for the software product should be the ease of entry <br>  data, as well as local and global (batch) editing.  Also <br>  A common problem is to encourage users to <br>  performing searches using boolean operators without detailed <br>  understanding boolean logic.  How you can make logic with visual aids <br>  requests more visual? <br><br>  In addition, an important feature of the product is its processing ability. <br>  large amount of information.  As a rule of thumb was perceived <br>  I have a fact, set forth a few decades ago by a professor <br>  Andries Van Dame of Brown University in the context of thinking about the future <br>  hypertext: after meaningful (no matter how much) boolean search, <br>  the user may still be forced to view and compare up to 500 <br>  results.  How can you evaluate the 500 displayed realities in one block, where <br>  each of them has a family (plus or minus two) attributes, each of which <br>  can be in seven (plus or minus two) states?  Also worth considering is <br>  the fact that we only have a few seconds to evaluate the data block, <br>  Decision making and transition to the next action.  For me it is <br>  fundamental problem of reproduction of information. <br><br>  In conclusion, it is necessary to mention the problem of compatibility of technology <br>  with a variety of platforms, whether desktop or portable <br>  environment.  Today it is identical to the difference between large and small <br>  screens - both should take full advantage <br>  advanced approach.  Compatibility with Web 2.0 also does not hurt. <br><br>  Going further, do not forget Herman Hesse‚Äôs fantastic novel ‚ÄúThe <br>  Glass Bead Game (Magister Ludi) ‚Äù, written in 1943.  In it the author <br>  introduced the society of the future, in which all knowledge is turned into music.  People, <br>  able to adequately perceive and play music, had the status of the masters of society, <br>  controlling him (and his) fate.  I believe that with the development <br>  advanced techniques of visualization and reproduction of information, we will be able <br>  manage your and other people's lives more powerfully and effectively.  Will hope, <br>  that this power will be the possession of many, not of the elect. <br><br>  By the way, my own fantasy about the future of information visualization <br>  born in my imagination more than 20 years ago: I imagined <br>  technology of the future, which was nothing more than a universal mosaic <br>  pixels encoded to display spatial, color, dynamic and <br>  even sound characteristics.  As a result, provided an abstract <br>  representation of a set of concepts on a universal visualization screen. <br>  Of course, it is necessary to know and remember the semantics in order to be able to <br>  "Read" the image.  With proper design and training, this solution could <br>  Become a highly efficient, simple, and efficient mechanism that is compatible with most hardware platforms. <br><br>  Will this or other technologies be universal and ubiquitous? <br>  application, time will tell.  However, one thing remains clear - the products of the future. <br>  should use the method of mapping structures and processes, which is still <br>  not available to current software applications. <br><br>  <strong>LINKS</strong> <br><br>  1.
