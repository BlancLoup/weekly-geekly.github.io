Not the most powerful of course, a representative of his time, but in Russia such good was very difficult to get, as it seems to me, and expensive.  I can only assume for what money they bought him then, considering that in the USA it cost $ 1300 -1500. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/da5/08b/1f7/da508b1f735640edf5ad956ea364edcc.jpg"><br><br>  Let's see what's inside. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/1f3/61b/d2a/1f361bd2af20e50c7125454d6999a69f.jpg"><br>  On the back there are connectors (from left to right bottom row): <br>  To connect the keyboard and mouse, to connect the printer;  the printer, by the way, got in the kit (LaserWriter 4/600 PS), modem, scsi, microphone and headphone jack (it has a built-in microphone, it‚Äôs not clear what it was for at that time - well, clearly not talking on Skype ), and the network card under the twisted pair. <br>  To get to the viscera, you need to unscrew the back lid, so that it still held onto the latches, but they are already broken off (the plastic has become very fragile from time to time, I myself broke a couple of latches while I took it apart). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a79/0c5/81d/a790c581d7565a121b819a7d740ae897.jpg"><br>  Removing the cover, we will get access to the disk: it is on a special sled, it does not represent anything outstanding.  Quantum 800MB IDE, but with the logo of the apple. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f88/d1c/c3c/f88d1cc3c3de794fb96eeb3018afb973.jpg"><br>  To get to the motherboard, you need to unscrew two more bolts and pull the handle on yourself with force. First you easily twitched, thought - I would tear off something, and only then I found the original instruction and after reading that I should do so, I attached good effort pulled the same board from the spot. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8ca/328/756/8ca328756c6dd67b7ec5f4e885be2bd9.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e66/c67/529/e66c67529a0c0960dc3de61ec0897c49.jpg"><br>  The board is also on a sled and is very securely mounted in the case. <br>  Although the computer and monoblock, but still supports various extensions, especially attracted the attention of the battery to maintain time in the computer.  Although running ahead, I can say that he did not show me the exact time (Mac OS 8 did not expect to live to 2000), 2 slots with SIM memory and a processor without a radiator.  If someone knows what that little red button is for - write me, as I understand it, it refers to scsi. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/203/37f/393/20337f3936e430e3c2b7385979d1bcf8.jpg"><br>  After removing the front panel, you can see the free connector for connecting the drive and rails for the slide, the drive is also on the slide. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ee/f5a/372/5eef5a37235bf7987c0208d59ac6d46d.jpg"><br>  Removing the cover, we get access to the remaining entrails. <br>  At the top is the power supply unit, unsoldered on the same board with the monitor;  to cool it, a fan is used, which is located in the case, that fan is very elegantly powered, and when you disassemble the case, you do not need to uncouple any wires. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3bd/6a5/a0a/3bd6a5a0a177cc62a12db31bb00c7a82.jpg"><br>  It is connected to the power connectors on the board and receives power from them. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b3/87d/5f7/7b387d5f7d8ae654d5b2506cccf075c8.jpg"><br>  The very same power supply board kinescope is on the next sled.  The two connectors dock with the rest of the electronics (the power supply is on the left, and the video signal on the right is on the screen). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fcb/da4/5d1/fcbda45d11483205fcd0f5f62cdc6098.jpg"><br>  In general, the whole structure is a sandwich in the middle of which there are various storage media (HDD, FDD, CD-ROM).  At the top of the board power and control the kinescope.  Bottom is a motherboard that is shielded from radiation from the power components. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0e0/b02/3b3/0e0b023b369873ab0888f84092683018.jpg"><br>  At first I did not immediately figure out how it turns on: there was no button on on it, like on the other poppies I got, but then, having connected the keyboard, I managed to turn it on with a special button from the keyboard (upper right key.).  An interesting feature: the mouse has a short wire and is stuck into the keyboard, and the keyboard is already connected to the computer so that less wires hang from the table. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6cf/f1b/2ef/6cff1b2ef7dbb7587cc27001d2ca2e66.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f8/fef/665/2f8fef66529ea4f130df3b71e84cfb16.jpg"><br>  Loads pretty fast. <br>  Unfortunately, there is little software on the machine itself, more precisely, there is only one express express quark and system utilities, there is not even a browser, so it was not possible to get on the Internet.  Pay attention to the image on the screen: the corners are rounded.  This was important for CRT monitors.  The computer is fully working and even makes sounds from the built-in speakers.

      In general, the design, in terms of design is very thought out.  This is the youngest model of the poppies I‚Äôve got, and in the future I‚Äôm going to talk about the Power Macintosh 7500, the Power Macintosh 9600, and the LaserWriter. <br><br>  <a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/0307003ALC580UG.pdf">Macintosh LC 580 manual</a> <br><br>  PS: I myself am not the owner of poppies, and the poppy is new to me, so if I wrote something wrong, please report it to the PM. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/163985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/163985/</a></p>
