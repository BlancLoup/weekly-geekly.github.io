He finds a like-minded two, with whom he will implement this universal project, fills in and sends the form to Y Combinator ... and about a miracle, they write to him that he is invited to an interview and most likely he and his friends will stay in the Bay Area for the winter! <br><br>  ... and here, when he goes for a visa to the US embassy, ‚Äã‚Äãhe has <a name="habracut"></a>  problems will begin.

      What is his visa? <br><br>  Student or tourist is dangerous.  If they are caught, they will be kicked out, and no startup will help.  Even if it will already be hundreds of thousands of dollars to bring. <br><br>  Investor / trading E-1 or E-2 - where did he get that kind of money from? <br><br>  There are two obvious options.  ‚ÄúWorking‚Äù H-1B and ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù B-1. <br><br>  And here the most interesting begins. <br><br>  Vasily in no way wants to ‚Äúwork for his uncle‚Äù any more, and does not see himself as an employee of any more ‚Äúforeign‚Äù company.  That's why he founds his startup.  In Y Combinator, he will not work for anyone except himself.  Even if he considers that he will be the Technical Director, the Director of Public Relations, the Chief Web Designer and part-time at the jointly rented apartment Chef, he will do all this in an American company ... which does not yet exist.  And which can not send him a request to Citizenship and Immigration Services.  And which can not provide your US taxpayer identification number. <br><br>  It turns out that Vasily cannot take H-1B. <br><br>  It is quite reasonable.  Vasily is now a businessman, Vasily opens his own business.  And he goes to the United States to run his own business there on a B-1 business visa ... <br><br>  ... but at the same time he cannot receive a salary from foreign companies.  He can open a company - but he cannot get a job in it.  At the same time, he can receive a salary in a Russian company - which is not there, because he is given an investment for opening an American company.  He will be allowed to open a company in the United States and get a share in it - but as soon as he starts to command this company, he will not be able to set a salary for himself (and he will have nothing to live for), because then he will have to renegotiate himself on the H- visa 1B ... <br><br>  So it turns out that Vasily goes to the United States "to open and work in his own company."  That, in theory, does not fall under a single type of existing visas. <br><br>  I wonder how this problem is solved? <br><br>  And isn't it time to introduce a new class of visa - ‚ÄúYC venture visa‚Äù :)? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29983/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29983/</a></p>
