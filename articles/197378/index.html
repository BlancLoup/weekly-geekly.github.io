  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hello again!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  We will carry out work on the bugs, and go to the habr with the desired topic, technical.  We hope this time everything goes as it should :). <br><br><h5>  About Us </h5><br>  So, our company is called Oversun Media, we are two years old and we are good guys <s>alcoholics</s> .  We develop and publish games, and also provide SaaS (in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãtraffic) to a number of partners.  At the moment we are working on games in two directions - mobile and browser-based. <br><br>  It was about the games that we wanted to communicate with the Habr audience more closely - to talk about how and what software we develop, share experiences and talk a little about internal services that greatly simplify the lives of our managers.  We are sure that many of our services in a truncated version will help you reduce time and financial costs, as well as improve the product.  For this reason, we strongly recommend to subscribe to our blog;). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today we can boast of two browser games.  The first, tactical RPG "Era 13", was released by us about a year ago and occupied its modest niche among browser games, which we are extremely happy about.  Another browser game, A-mega, is now in preparation for launching closed beta testing (PTA), and is just waiting for its release to the public.

      In the client part, both games are based on HTML / CSS / JS, and the server side - a whole pile of technologies that I would not like to stir up now - the time will come. <br><br>  The mobile direction is only gaining momentum.  We have already released one small entertaining game for iOS - ‚Äú4teh birds‚Äù.  In the comments you can leave a request for a key because it‚Äôs not customary to visit guests empty-handed :).  At the stage of early alpha is the second, and the third game just got out of the hands of game designers and is preparing to be reborn from concept into a working application.  Talking about these products, we will also postpone a bit, we hope that by the time the articles on mobile games are released, they will have time to gain their audience. <br><br><h5>  Why are we here? </h5><br>  Usually, when the word "game" (in the context of software, of course) comes to mind some picture, gameplay, sound.  But all this is far from a game.  A full game can not live without replication (traffic), a couple of statistics systems and graphics assemblies, build servers, billing and many other things that always remain behind the scenes.  Many indie developers are unlikely to appreciate the scale of the infrastructure, and those who are not involved in the game industry are likely to be surprised when reading some topics. <br><br>  PR really is not the top priority that we solve through the blog on Habr√©.  The main task is to highlight the technologies used by us, to tell about the developments and projects, the tasks and tools to be solved, at the same time collecting interesting developers into their team.  After all, it is no secret that very, very many developers put their wages and technology stack on one level (or even higher), and we will be happy to see them in our ranks. <br><br><h5>  Our vision </h5><br>  When we were determined what we were going to talk about with Habr, we had a feeling that there should be an introductory one that will tell the reader about those who write for him and who answer his questions.  Of course, this is not one person or one department.  Structurally, our company consists of the following departments related to programming and project support: <br><ul><li>  Game Development Department </li><li>  Server Development </li><li>  Mobile Games Development Department </li><li>  Department of web support </li><li>  Game Design Department </li><li>  Testing department </li></ul><br>  Of course, all developers (and there are exactly 25 of them) cannot follow comments and requests, much less answer.  Therefore, we decided that it would be right to apply the ‚Äúorder table‚Äù.  Those.  you propose a topic for discussion, we are working on it and publish it in the form of an essay.  Applications can be left as a personal message to any of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/oversun_media/profile/">Oversun Media employees</a> . <br><br>  But it's always hard to start.  Therefore, we have worked out a short list of topics for discussion, on which we will try to fulfill our obligations in the near future :).  We deliberately chose the least public and lit topics in order to replenish public knowledge.  According to our forecasts, these topics should be the hottest and most popular.  Whether this is true or not, time will show, but for now we suggest reading this list: <br><ul><li>  Traffic management  On the system of traffic distribution, metrics and performance analysis. </li><li>  Game servers.  Technology, architecture and life cycle. </li><li>  Game statistics.  Why and how to cook. </li></ul><br>  In addition, we will try to shed light on the Holy of Holies - the office of Oversun Media: you are waiting for a walk through the "Glass Cuba" in the photos, acquaintance with the "office brownies" and a couple of pleasant surprises. <br><br>  <strong>Thanks for attention.</strong>  <strong>See you soon!</strong> <br><br>  <strong>PS</strong> : Special thanks to the participants of the topic, who witnessed our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/oversun_media/blog/197094/">first attempt to make friends</a> .  We have taken into account the mistakes and will do everything to ensure that the current post is remembered by you as a post dating from Oversun Media. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197378/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197378/</a></p>
