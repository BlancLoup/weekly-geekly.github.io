      What awaits us all at Joker 2015?  Let's go under the cut, I'll tell you everything there. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Last year joker</b> <br><br>  Last Joker was held in St. Petersburg, too, in mid-October.  It was the fourth big Java conference from JUG.ru.  In the grid of Joker 2014 there were <b>38 reports</b> .  Of these, 36 - in the main program and 2 keynote.  There were quite a few participants: together with the speakers, there were more than 700 people. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e7a/9ef/dc5/e7a9efdc5b6a462c8376406c52ee96a1.jpg"><br><br>  This video tells in detail what last year's Joker was: <br><br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://player.vimeo.com/video/112640636&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhH_AMVIlkVAGk5hpiPwWUInPhmAA" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" title="Joker 2014 Official Video" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Now it's time to talk more about Joker 2015. <br><br>  <b>Format</b> <br>  It will remain the same: reports of 60 minutes, two days, three parallel tracks.  Of the new ones, we will extend the breaks a little so that the participants have time to communicate normally with the speakers and with each other, drink coffee, go for a smoke, etc.  etc.  Secondly, we will experiment with closing - at the end of each day, we will gather all the participants in one hall and make closing keynote.  Thus, in the current grid we have 28 reports - 4 keynotes and 24 sectional ones. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Unlike last time, all keynotes will be technical!</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17f/407/285/17f40728516a4e90b7ba7eda617ef012.jpg"><br></div></div><br><br>  <b>Speakers and Topics</b> <br>  With whom we have already managed to agree: <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73e/104/e80/73e104e80b691d2d64c3df219bfac317.jpg" alt="shipilev" align="left"><br>  <b>Alexey Shipilev</b> is a performance expert from Oracle, the face of the Java SE Performance team, a brilliant speaker.  Repeatedly spoke both in Russia and abroad, consistently included in the top speakers at any conference at which he speaks.  His numerous reports in Russian are available on the <a href="http://jug.ru/speakers/1">new site JUG.ru.</a>  Alexey is now thinking about what exactly to make a report.  Most likely, it will be a report about updates in the class String in based on its current projects: <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/254">Compact Strings</a> , <a href="http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/8085796">Indify String Concat</a> . <br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a6/135/80a/7a613580a85b4dcfb7390e0fd478631b.jpg" alt="thompson" align="left"><br>  <b>Martin Thompson (Martin Thompson)</b> - an expert on high-performance systems, the author of the famous framework <b>Disruptor</b> , now more working on Aeron, high-performance transport for messages.

Simultaneous translation we <b>will not</b> do - this is our principal organizational position.  Learn English, gentlemen! <br><br>  However, you should not be afraid here: almost all of the speakers who come speak English is very understandable - a speech without hellish accents and slangs, at a moderate pace. <br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Here, for example, one of the reports of Martin.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MC1EKLQ2Wmg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhju4RZd8i3AV893oKGQJZETkEhb9g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br></div></div><br><br><br><hr><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab3/b23/2a7/ab3b232a737c41a1a38a84df1f853caa.jpg" alt="pangin" align="left"><br>  <b>Andrey <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/apangin/" class="user_link">apangin</a> Pangin</b> is an expert on JVM and high performance from Odnoklassniki, sun.misc.Unsafe Gangster, who loves to poke a virtual machine at his leisure and tell his world about his hacks.

The love of Codeborne guys for the Play framework has long been known.  They love it so much that they are the main contributors to its Java 1.3 branch.  And so we asked Andrew to highlight the opposite side of this framework.  The working title of the report is ‚ÄúWhat's wrong with Play?‚Äù The announcement will appear the other day. <br><br><br><hr><br><br>  Now we are negotiating with <b>about 20 more speakers</b> .  According to our estimates, by the end of August, the program will be formed by 90 percent. So wait for the announcements! <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  A few important things in the end. <br><br>  Firstly, despite the fact that 60% of the program has already been formed, the <a href="http://jokerconf.com/callforpapers/">Call for Papers form</a> works for us.  This means that anyone can apply for a report to us, which will be considered by our program committee in the chapter with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/real_ales/" class="user_link">real_ales</a> .  If you are an experienced speaker and there are good videos from your speeches on the Internet, you have good chances to get into our program.  If you haven‚Äôt spoken at a special place anywhere - don‚Äôt judge too little chances.  We will train you in every way, arrange test performances, and only the most courageous and steadfast will get into the main program. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d3/e1b/9b1/7d3e1b9b1e9745d887e08043c4ad1dc1.jpeg"><br><br>  Secondly, registration for the conference is already <a href="http://jokerconf.com/">open</a> .  This time we have three types of tickets: <br><ul><li>  <b>Online</b> - ticket, giving the opportunity to watch online broadcast; </li><li>  <b>Standard</b> - a ticket that includes standard conference attendance, lunches and coffee breaks, gifts from the organizers; </li><li>  <b>Business</b> - major ticket: check in at a separate counter, front seats, Afterparty with speakers. </li></ul><br><br>  In the next publications I will tell you more about last year's Joker, analyze the highest-rated reports of 2014 and, of course, tell you more about the upcoming conference.  It is convenient to follow Joker 2015 news on our public networks: <a href="https://vk.com/jokerconf">vk</a> , <a href="https://www.facebook.com/jokerconf">fb</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/jugru">twitter JUG.ru.</a>  As we approach the conference, there will be more and more news about it.  And of course <a href="http://jokerconf.com/">on the conference website</a> . <br><br>  <b>We are waiting for you on Joker 2015!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/262745/">https://habr.com/ru/post/262745/</a></p>
