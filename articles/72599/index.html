  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Business Internet. The first day</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the entrance, participants are met by girls in blue T-shirts and racks with hundreds of ‚Äúeco-friendly‚Äù badges.  After finding your badge and receiving a no less eco-friendly paper bag, you can proceed to the reports. <br>  The official opening included a presentation by the representative of the Joint Institute for Informatics Problems of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus, in which he spoke about the implementation of our state programs, showed screenshots of Barack Hussein Obama's home page and even tried to look at them, but the persistent screenshots in presentes did not succumb.  He was followed by the founding father of the Bineta flagship, Yuri Zisser (hereinafter referred to as YA).  In his speech, as usual, there was a slide four years ago, which listed the main problems of the Bynet.  True, 2 points were deleted.  Paying tribute to the efforts of Beltelecom to expand the external gateway to 17 GB and lower prices, UA again walked through the monopolist: compared it with neighboring countries, reminded about the ‚Äúdiscounts‚Äù when selling traffic to providers.  Listening to his report, I even wondered how the logos of tut.baya and beltelekom could coexist on a banner at the presidium table. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After the coffee break, the conference went to 3 threads.  In the main hall there were reports on the research of the Belarusian audience, the founder of Akavita, Fyodor Korolenko, spoke about his new products, which should make life easier for webmasters and advertisers.  After the speech, Fedor was traditionally asked what he lived for.  Fedor scored the air in his lungs, but his partner Muraviev jumped to the microphone and said that Akavita is not a public company and they are not obliged to answer.  The hall of educational technologies on the 3rd floor could hardly accommodate everyone to listen to reports on e-commerce.  Personally, in a dense crush, I was enough only for the report of the Priorbank, where it was told about the planned victorious march of the WEBPAY payment system.  For business owners, it will cost 4% of the payment, and for customers ... for customers, I hope, it will be more convenient than "mega-friendly" online banking prior.  In the hall of the second floor at that time, one could hear about the successful use of the Komsomol in both the printed and electronic versions.  Following the CP, it was told about the creation of a ‚Äúguest‚Äù radio here and its development into TV. <br><br>  After lunch - a series of reports on the state of the advertising market in Belarus.  In my opinion, the value of some was slightly more than zero.  But in general, the level of reports was higher than last year - last year, after similar reports, I sat in a slight bewilderment with one thought: ‚ÄúWho?  Who pays them money for it? ‚ÄùA little later, representatives of <a href="http://tut.by/">tut.by</a> , <a href="http://onliner.by/">onliner.by</a> , <a href="http://marketing.by/">marketing.by</a> joined the speakers and a rectangular round table began.  It began very interestingly: one of the participants voiced rumors about the purchase of Akavita.  A representative of Hemius casually mentioned the elements of opacity of the foot.  Having seized this phrase, the representative na.by/Akavita tried to ask him some questions, but she apparently had problems with the wording, and neither the audience nor the participants on the stage could understand the question.  I remember that that year, at a round CEO-table in response to her remark about ‚Äúthe participants didn‚Äôt want to shoot the topic‚Äù, one of the SEO officials terribly rudely almost sent her in the style of F. Kirkorov.  On the whole, everything went peacefully, and even Voloshin‚Äôs fleeting reproach at Stelmakh, connected with onlineer's unwillingness to cooperate, caused only smiles.

      In the final part of the day, the round table ‚Äú100 questions TUT.BY‚Äù took place.  At the table were: Alexander Chekan, Kirill Voloshin, YuA, Igor Zettich, Alla Lapatko, as well as the editor-in-chief and responsible for radio / TV.  The conversation began somehow sluggishly, it seemed that the audience had absolutely no questions for the market leader.  Over time, the communication became more lively and somewhere in the second ten still the long-awaited question about the conflict with interfax sounded.  To my surprise, it was not the Chief Editor or Voloshin who answered him.  She began with the classics: "This is a dispute between two economic entities." It would be better if she finished this, because her answer was a bit like justification for the guilty schoolgirl (and in fact the answer, and in its form).  Touched by the answer about the method of selecting news for the main page - it was stated that the portal does not pursue cheap popularity and does not follow the path of placing yellow content to increase views.  Did the transfers from chips. No occur as a result of hacking the portal?) But the listeners were interested not only in scandals: they asked questions about the migration to gmail, and about the company's revenues, and about the killers of the fuck.  UA told about the income of 2 million in 2008, about the old leaky and new reliable mail based on Google, about the rumors about the planned arrival of Russian and Baltic monsters.  Personally, I was surprised by the rumor about the possible arrival of Delphi.  For a year ago, with my own ears, I heard from their leadership that there can be no talk of any arrival in the Republic of Belarus under the current political system.  Interestingly, the changed plans are a reaction to the crisis, or they have already seen the secret cards ... This completes the story, because then a hard political offtop is possible. <br><br>  PS At the end of the meeting, participants were asked to voice their favorite sites.  Alexander Chekan mentioned habr. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72599/</a></p>
