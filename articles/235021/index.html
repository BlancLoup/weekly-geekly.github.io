  <section class="page js-page"><h1>YUI developers have announced the termination of further library development.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Below is a translation of the <a href="http://yahooeng.tumblr.com/post/96098168666/important-announcement-regarding-yui">post</a> from the blog of the development team</i> . <br><br>  Yahoo User Interface Library (YUI) has been used by Yahoo since 2005.  The library was presented publicly on February 13, 2006.  Although YUI has been very transformed since that time, it has always pursued one big goal - to provide developers with an extensive set of tools for easily creating rich web applications. <br><br>  YUI is an important part of Yahoo history.  Millions of lines of code using YUI were written, and this code is still used today.  Anyway, it became clear to us - the industry is moving in a different direction. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Many of you know that the web platform has undergone significant changes in recent years.  JavaScript is currently more common than ever.  The emergence of Node.js allowed the use of JavaScript on the server side, thereby opening the door to create isomorphic single-page applications.  New package managers (npm, bower) have led to the growth of an ecosystem of third-party, open-source and single-task tools that complement each other, honoring the Unix philosophy and providing excellent flexibility.  New build tools (Grunt and its ecosystem of plugins, Broccoli, Gulp) have simplified the assembly of these tiny modules into large applications.  New frameworks (Backbone, React, Ember, Polymer, Angular, etc.) helped to design more flexible and scalable web applications.  New testing tools (Mocha, Casper, Karma, etc.) have lowered the entry threshold for building reliable means of continuous deployment.  Different standards (W3C, ECMA) put in order what was corrected over the years and supplemented with large JavaScript frameworks, allowing us to use the modern features of the web platform without the involvement of additional tools.  Finally, browser developers are now more willing to make improvements to their products, realizing the latest standards.  With so-called ‚Äúevergreen browsers‚Äù that make the browser upgrade process as simple as possible, we can expect a significant reduction in the diversity of user agents.

      The implications of the evolution of web technologies are that large JavaScript libraries, such as YUI, now receive far less attention from the community.  Many developers today look at large JavaScript libraries as gardens that are located behind a large wall.  They do not want to become their hostages.  As a result, the number of proposals for improving the library and merging requests that we have received over the past few years has slowly decreased to a tiny stream.  Most of the core YUI modules no longer have active responsible developers, and now they just rely on random patches from external developers.  Thanks to several code reviewers, there is still hope that incoming patches will be checked quickly and carefully. <br><br>  Thus, <b>we made a difficult decision to immediately stop all new developments related to YUI</b> in order to focus our efforts on a new technology landscape.  This means that in the future there will be few new releases of YUI and they will contain the planned fixes that are critical for the development of Yahoo. <br><br>  The mission of the YUI team at Yahoo remains unchanged - developing the best next-generation presentation technologies, with an initial focus on the company's developers.  We remain optimistic about the future of presentation technologies and we are eager to continue working with the entire front-end community, share and learn together. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/235021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/235021/</a></p>
