      Those.  A person describes what he wants, how much money is needed, the minimum payment and puts his ‚Äúorder‚Äù on public display. <br>  As a result, we have two types of applications for folding. <br>  The first is the customer / performer. <br>  The second is the customer. <br><br><h3>  Customer executive </h3><br>  One orders, the other does, all the others are thrown off. <br><br>  Take the same translation. <br>  I find a person who can translate the standard I need, he agrees to a certain amount and time. <br>  A request is created, I indicate the description of the task, the timeframe, the minimum amount that can be added, the contractor and I contribute the first part of the money. <br>  Then everyone who needs this translation is thrown off.  As soon as the amount reaches 100%, the performer confirms that he has started the task, does his job and presents it to the public. <br>  Then everyone who threw off can write reviews and I, as the creator, confirm that the task is completed.  The entire amount collected is sent to the Executive. <br><br><h3>  Customer </h3><br>  One writes what the money is to him, the rest fall off <br><br>  For example.  A man writes about collecting money for himself on a BMW.  And places an application after which everyone can throw him a penny. <br>  Or, instead of a BMW, we take a more noble goal - money for boarding school.  Few will mess with sending money to an account through a bank, but they can send SMS. <br><br><h2>  Highlights: </h2><br>  1. A large choice of the method of transferring / receiving money is the main difficulty. <br>  2. At any time, you can see how much money has already been collected and how much is already left. <br>  3. Probably it makes sense to make it possible to place query indicators on your site.  "Now I collect on the BMW, I have already collected so much." <br><br>  I can not judge myself strictly, because the attitude is biased, so it is interesting to hear your opinions. <br><br>  <i>Moved from personal to ideas for startups ...</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27099/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27099/</a></p>
