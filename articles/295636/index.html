"Stories with languages" (issue 4)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Talking about your startup "languages" of famous and popular people, you can also hear from them useful thoughts for the project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a3/153/206/4a3153206e96432a9b1886d889d68099.jpg"><br><br>  On October 6, an online service blog for language professionals published <a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/blog/115">an interview with</a> Honored Master of Sports of Ukraine, holder of the title ‚ÄúThe Strongest Man of the World‚Äù and multiple world champion in all-round power, who told a freelance platform about the role of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãin his life and his career as an athlete and the actor, about how he teaches his sons to sports and languages, as well as curious cases related to the language barrier. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The interview was published as part of the <i>Polyglot</i> PR online campaign - a series of interviews with famous personalities called <i>‚Äú <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/polyglot/blog/19308/">Stories with Languages</a> ‚Äù</i> , in which celebrities talk about the role foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãplay in their personal lives, how their knowledge of languages ‚Äã‚Äãhelps them and simply share their , sometimes unusual, "stories with languages."  According to the founder of the platform, <i>Andrey Prudko</i> , the goal of the campaign is to promote the study of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãand the service itself.  This is the fourth interview, which takes the service of freelancers as part of its PR campaign.  Earlier in the cycle, the <i>Polyglot</i> team spoke with American singer <i><a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/34">Stereolizza</a></i> , Spanish electronic music singer <i><a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/blog/53">Zhanna Ona</a></i> and Russian actress <i><a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/blog/76">Marina Dubkova</a></i> .  The video interview was conducted via <i>Skype</i> and was published along with the full text version of a blog on the platform site for freelance linguists.  Thus, a PR campaign with famous people is paying off.
