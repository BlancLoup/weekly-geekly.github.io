We present to your attention the creators of historical jewelry and copies of real artifacts - LOM.  In the article we will tell about the company itself, about the origin of the idea, difficulties, victories and how important the correct choice of hosting provider is in the decision-making process. </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Tell about you? </h5><br><p>  In childhood, we did not show any inclination for jewelry and especially for business.  Both received high-quality domestic education and interesting professions, worked with pleasure and achieved corresponding success.  But once a difficult decision was made, we got off the rolling rails and started our own business.  We hoped that it would make us happier, freer, of course, better off and let us realize our full potential.  More diverse, our life has become definitely! <br></p><br><p><img width="300" alt="  Inoventica Services.

Lom history - the history in detail"><br></p><br><h5>  Where did the business idea come from? </h5><br><p>  For a very long time we have been engaged in military-historical reconstruction, in particular, the reconstruction of historical costumes and accessories.  It always seemed to us that the reconstruction movement was too close a framework for copies of historical jewelery, we really wanted to offer them to a wider audience, to return them to modern everyday life.  Actually, as soon as we realized that it could be in demand in the market, everything began to turn. <br></p><br><p><img width="300" alt="  Inoventica Services. Lom history -   " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee7/885/bc2/ee7885bc238f81c94995e62b4da8c084.jpg" height="200" title="Successful customers of Inoventica Services.

Lom history - the history in detail"><br></p><br><h5>  How to start? </h5><br><p>  From scratch.  In the most literal sense.  We store our very first catalog - there are not even a dozen items in it.  We can hardly last a month with our starting capital now in Moscow.  The development was very gradual, but it made our small business more stable, and the decisions made were very conscious and balanced. <br></p><br><p><img width="300" alt="  Inoventica Services. Lom history -   " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e21/b84/49d/e21b8449d3926d7c46729fcd1ab09934.jpg" height="200" title="Successful customers of Inoventica Services.

Lom history - the history in detail"><br></p><br><h5>  Who are your customers? </h5><br><p>  Our first clients were our hobby colleagues - members of the historical reconstruction movement.  They are still with us, we are only expanding the range of special thematic products for them.  Reenactors very strictly assess the degree of reliability of products, their compliance with historical prototypes, so popularity among this audience is our special pride. <br></p><br><p>  The same important clients for us are people who may not even be interested in history at all, but open to new things, appreciating original, non-standard ideas.  Historical decorations are unique, but universal at the same time.  By and large, all those who wear jewelry are our customers.  To this we strive. <br></p><br><p><img width="300" alt="  Inoventica Services.

Lom history - the history in detail"><br></p><br><h5>  How were you looking for the first customers? </h5><br><p>  The most banal free ways: social networks, participation in various exhibitions and events.  We still can not afford paid advertising, so we continue in the same spirit.  Only added, as it is now fashionable to say, loyalty programs.  We appreciate loyal customers and try to make them feel it. <br></p><br><p><img width="300" alt="  Inoventica Services.

Lom history - the history in detail"><br></p><br><h5>  What problems did business face then and now? </h5><br><p>  ‚ÄúIndividual entrepreneurship‚Äù - just two words, but this concept seems to include everything!  We had to understand the most unexpected activities and objects, and to understand very well and quickly, because the microbusiness is very sensitive to trifles.  In Russia now, in principle, there is no market for small business services, an infrastructure that would allow concentrating directly on the chosen lesson and not splashing on related problems like budget lighting of shop windows or layout of directories.  Such services can be found, but they are too expensive and not of high quality in the sense that you still need to figure it out yourself. <br></p><br><p>  There are technological difficulties: the production base for a long time was collapsing in the country, now it is felt even at our level, it is difficult to maintain consistently high product quality.  The instability of commodity prices also affected.  What can I say, in general, the situation in the country is not the most inspiring.  But you can not lose heart!  Diligent and hard work has repeatedly helped us out of the most difficult situations. <br></p><br><p><img width="300" alt="  Inoventica Services. Lom history -   " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/63e/feb/e86/63efebe8661efef75a1ff65872f68c42.jpg" height="243" title="Successful customers of Inoventica Services.

Lom history - the history in detail"><br></p><br><h5>  Does the site help solve them? </h5><br><p>  The site is very easy to work with customers, in order and was created.  In the future, you plan to convert it into a full-fledged online store, but even now, in the format of a website, it helps us a lot.  It is easy to direct the client to the site, where he can get acquainted with the assortment, find the address of the showroom. <br></p><br><p>  On the business card you do not print the address of the page on the social network.  The site is necessary for any business that works with the end user. <br></p><br><p><img width="300" alt="  Inoventica Services.

Lom history - the history in detail"><br></p><br><h5>  Who designed the site? </h5><br><p>  We used the Wix service and made the site ourselves, it turned out to be very simple. <br></p><br><p><img width="300" alt="  Inoventica Services. Lom history -   " src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0b/2ff/be1/e0b2ffbe1ab409ec1084f39f0b74732e.jpg" height="208" title="Successful customers of Inoventica Services.

Lom history - the history in detail"><br></p><br><h5>  How many customers come through the site? </h5><br><p>  Complex issue.  Since orders are not made through the site, we do not have exact statistics.  Many come to the showroom to try on and see things, it is not always possible to track which of them found us on the site.  Activity is and its dynamics makes us happy. <br></p><br><h5>  What are the criteria for choosing a hoster? </h5><br><p>  Simplicity and clearness of service.  And, of course, not only at the stage of purchase, but above all in further exploitation.  I do not really want to understand some subtleties, there is simply no time for this.  Stable work, simple and clear personal account, notifications about the need to pay for services, operational support service - what else do you need ?! <br></p><br><p> <img width="600" alt="  Inoventica Services.
