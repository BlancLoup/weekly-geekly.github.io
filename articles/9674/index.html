  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The rule that changed my life</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Not so long ago, I realized a very important thing that saved me a lot of nerve cells and improved my relations with the outside world.  Let me explain with an example: <a name="habracut"></a>  - the chief yelled at me, with which it is absolutely not fair.  I sat in front of the computer, angry and hatched plans for revenge.  The boss seemed to me the embodiment of evil, a man who takes pleasure in oppressing others.  Here he stands on the balcony, drinking coffee and talking to someone on the phone.  Probably tells his wife how he successfully started the morning spoiling the mood of half the office.  Eh, if I were in his place I would not allow myself that for anything.  Why?  Imagine - I am an entrepreneur, invested a lot of money in a new direction, hired people, an office, spent a lot of strength and nerves, but no sense.  There is no profit and that's all, but there‚Äôs still tax.  I go to the office - who drives tea in the kitchen, who plays solitaire, someone is not at work at all, the phone is ringing, they don‚Äôt pay attention, or maybe an important client calls it?  Wow, his teeth creaked from indignation.  Here, take at least this, sits a site with jokes reads: <br>  - You promised to finish the program yesterday, where is she? <br>  - I did not have time, it's just that the server is shorter ... <br>  - You always have some excuses, you use the fact that I do not understand anything about it! <br>  - No, I was going to finish yesterday, but the light was cut off ... <br>  - So it was necessary to finish before he chopped off, and not read jokes!  You will not receive awards!  And clean the workplace, otherwise you‚Äôll have frogs here soon! <br>  Went to the balcony to drink coffee (I went to bed at one o'clock, I got up at 6 am) and call the bank, talk about deferment of loan repayment.  After all, you were lucky with the collaborators, you and the newest technology, and the office near the subway, to get it was more convenient, and the Internet is the fastest, and they only think how to do nothing but get paid.  Vaughn, sitting sulking, and knocking on the keys, I suppose I complain to my friends that the boss is an idiot. <br>  Um, it turns out interesting details.  It turns out the head does not dream to spoil my mood, he just wants his business to work.  But it could still be more attentive, not interrupt and listen to what he is being told.  Although I could not mumble, but it was normal to explain to him that yesterday the server fell and had to restore it half a night, but I fixed everything, almost finished the program, and now I just decided to rest for 10 minutes, drink a seagull, read the news on the Internet.  Yes, and on my desk, and the truth is what the hell is going on. <br>  And then the situation can only get worse - the next time, if the server falls, I will not bother with it during off-hours and deliberately go home at 18.00, the boss, seeing my attitude, will fire me, I will destroy all the files that I only have access to and hang the virus on the accountant‚Äôs computer, and then, uh, it's even scary to think, and the third world can start. <br>  The moral is simple - in a conflict situation, try to put yourself in the place of another person, and perhaps you will understand that this is not a monster, but a person like you. <br>  Try to recall your last quarrel and apply this method, well, how, was it really worth fighting? </div>
