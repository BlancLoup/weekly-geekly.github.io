Like all organizers, I do it for the soul and for my own pleasure.  And since the main organizer on Habr√© does not have a personal account, I decide to take the liberty to promote this festival a little. <br><br>  In addition, in this topic, I would like to show the connection of the IT world and photography, because not many realize that these worlds overlap so much, combining the creative and rational in a single whole. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  So PR. </h6><br> <a href="http://www.alternatyvy.org.ua/"><img src="http://amg.org.ua/banners/alt09/alt09_220x220_ru.gif" alt="Alternatives" align="left"></a>  ‚Äú <b><a href="http://www.alternatyvy.org.ua/">Alternatives</a></b> ‚Äù is a youth photo-festival that includes a competition and free master classes with the participation of professional photographers. <br>  The festival organizers are young people working in different IT companies, mainly programmers, project managers and marketers who come together every year to organize a photo-festival for young people.  Last year, the Kiev Photo Fair Directorate also became a co-organizer of the festival, thanks to which the exposition of the best works takes place within the framework of this international photo exhibition.

      And for the first time the festival "Alternatives" was held in 2006, when all its organizers were still students.  At that time, the organizers did not have any experience or major resources for the festival, but the idea was to do something not only interesting, but also a developing youth photo, which almost disappeared after the perestroika period.  This idea was shared by the first partners of the festival (by the way most of them continue to help the festival even now) and the only youth photography festival in Ukraine was born that way. <br><br>  Today, photographers from 17 to 25 years old from all countries of Central and Eastern Europe can take part in the festival.  During the festival, a photo contest is held, the winners of which receive valuable prizes from partners, and 60 finalists have the opportunity to showcase their work to more than twelve thousand visitors of the Kiev Photo Fair. <br><br>  Anyone can submit their work for the competition until April 30, 2009, simply by filling out a form and sending the work through the competition website.  This option is very convenient, as usually photographers themselves need to print a photo and send it to real mail, which not only takes more time and effort, but also can lead to loss of work during shipment. <br><br>  In addition, the festival also has a social part - this is the holding of free master classes.  This year, the IT company GlobalLogic, which provided its corporate club and a full set of equipment for master classes, became the technical partner of the festival, thanks to which more than 500 people were able to visit them.  By the way, very famous in Ukraine photographers responded to the invitation of the organizers to conduct a master class, some of them have world names and are participants in many photo exhibitions around the world, in particular the biennale in Germany and Venice, photo exhibitions in Switzerland, Brazil, Canada and the USA. <br>  Most likely, in the end of April or in the middle of May there will be the second part of the master classes, to which some well-known photographers have already been invited as presenters. <br><br>  Here are some photos from the master classes: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/73a/754/6bb/73a7546bbad82af6efcc28908055e6ea.jpg" alt="Master class by Alexey Abramov.

Although I recently proposed to expand the list thanks to voluntary donations, as it should be a non-commercial project.  Therefore, all those who wish to help both financially and non-financially - <a href="http://blog.alternatyvy.org.ua/ru/how_to_help/">welcome</a> :) <br><br>  And those who, like me, do not know how to take good pictures, <a href="http://www.alternatyvy.org.ua/gallery/">can simply look at the works of the participants</a> who have already been sent. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/56397/">https://habr.com/ru/post/56397/</a></p>
