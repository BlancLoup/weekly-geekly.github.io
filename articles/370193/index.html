  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Emercoin vs Ethereum and comparison of private and public blockchains</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Emercoin is not only one of the world's leading digital currencies, but also a distributed trusted information system.  On the basis of the Emerging blockchain platform, many projects have been created that have proven their profitability and success - just complete this article to the end, paying attention to examples of projects implemented on the basis of Emer.  Over the past year, the Emercoin team has repeatedly received proposals to create either new public blockchains based on the Emergency platform platform or private blockchains on the same platform.  But neither one nor the other idea can be called successful.  The Emer team boldly states that the private blockchain is originally a mertorn-born project, and the forks (their own public blockchains on the finished platform) are not very promising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7e4/6ae/788/7e46ae788f634245a9447d694a109aec.png"><br><br>  Read more about this in the article by Emercoin CTO Oleg Hovayko, written specifically for the cloud mining blog <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D286116">HashFlare</a> on Geektimes. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Private and restricted blockchains </h1><br><h3>  History reference </h3><br>  Private blockchains have been around since 1980.  One of the first mentions can be found in Bruce Schneier‚Äôs Applied Cryptography, Section 4.1, on Surety Technologies‚Äôs time stamp system.  I wonder if anyone knew about the existence of the blockchain before reading this article?  And if for almost 40 years no one in the world has succeeded in creating private blockchains - you have to be a big optimist in order to count on a different result.  Do not think that everything will be easy and simple for you.  Let's try to figure out why we are not aware of successful projects of this kind.

    <h3>  Private blockchain to hide information </h3><br>  The idea: to create a private blockchain, transactions in which will be available only to a limited circle of participants. <br><br>  Solution: the blockchain is, by definition, an open database, and each node in the network has its full copy.  Open data access is required to verify, add, or reject new transactions.  Thus, an unencrypted copy of the blockchain is stored with each network participant.  It is necessary for the system to ‚Äúleak out‚Äù in one place, as the entire transaction database, along with its history, will be completely merged.  And the wider the network, the more people have access to the blockchain, which means that the chance that the blockchain will be compromised increases. <br><br>  To ensure privacy, you need to restrict access to information, that is, to make a server that will give only the necessary information on requests and only verified clients, and not everything and everyone.  And this is not a blockchain, but something else. <br><br><h3>  Private blockchain for exchanging money within a limited community </h3><br>  The idea: to create a private financial blockchain, in which only privileged participants will have access to the coins. <br><br>  Solution: it is technically possible to create such a solution.  Transactions will be signed by some kind of certificate issued by the authorization center.  Consequently, a centralized system is formed, access to which is controlled by the target audience.  The compromise of this center will automatically lead to the compromise of the entire network, which again levels the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe blockchain.  And such a compromise is a reality: remember the history of the company DigiNotar or sold in the markets of the traffic police base, the tax service. <br><br>  And it is obvious that an effective solution will be the base of a centralized server with regular backups, when the owners of the server can control the participants. <br><br><h3>  Public blockchain with miner restriction </h3><br>  The idea: to create a public blockchain, which everyone has access to, but not all can mine (mint) new coins, but only verified agents. <br>  Solution: theoretically it is possible, but it will be necessary to somehow restrict access, for example, by means of certificates or digital signatures.  And here there are several problems: <br><br><ol><li>  Based on the fact that the compromise of the authorization center leads to the compromise of the entire network, since the complexity of mining is low, we will inevitably face the fact that those who receive a certificate will be able to attract external mining power.  And if they turn out to be much stronger than the current capacity of an artificially limited network, then certificate holders will be able to organize attacks, cancel transactions, and double spending.  Essentially the same as in the previous example. <br><br></li><li>  A dishonest legal network participant may attract external mining powers - and the result will be the same.  And the more such legal participants, the greater the chance that someone will be unstable. </li></ol><br>  In general, such a potentially vulnerable architecture can only be used to build a financial network to pay for school lunches within the same school, and nothing more. <br><br><h3>  Manifest public blockchain </h3><br>  The idea: to create a blockchain currency for a particular country.  At the same time, it is necessary to give the central bank the following opportunities: <br><br><ul><li>  to print money in any quantity; </li><li>  block other people's accounts; </li><li>  withdraw money from foreign accounts. </li></ul><br>  Solution: if you create such a control lever, then sooner or later, it will be used. <br>  Management sanctions or abuse of authority, there is always a reason.  For example, owning the appropriate keys - will transfer into your account a billion coins, and run away to another country. <br><br>  And it turns out that the credibility of such a blockchain will not be higher than the confidence in the corresponding central bank.  More precisely, even lower, because blockchain transactions are non-cancellable. <br><br>  In general, attempts to make a limited blockchain lead to the fact that, along with public access, public trust flows from it.  A dummy remains from the blockchain - something like a dried shell from a cicada.  That is, in such a blockchain participants will have to drive from under the lash.  The threat of simultaneous collapse will be constantly present. <br><br>  Historical experience confirms these theses.  Only open and public blockchain is successful.  Blockchain without limits. <br><br><h3>  Own public blockchain against public blockchain Emer </h3><br>  The idea: to make a fork, that is, another blockchain on our technologies, but with other coins and independent of us. <br><br>  Solution: the creation of a fork is initially a rash step, but not everyone can be persuaded.  Therefore, sometimes, for a fee, Emercoin makes forks. <br><br>  The board consists of three parts: <br><br><ul><li>  for the fork itself; </li><li>  for the creation of infrastructure (seeds, explorer, pool, checkpoints) </li><li>  for maintenance - support both infrastructure and continued development of the system. </li></ul><br>  The financial success of such forks is small.  It is no better and no worse than countless hosts, abandoned Bitcoin forks, of which there are hundreds.  Examples offhand: Copperlark (CLR), Joulecoin (XJO), Photon (PHO).  Attempting to make a new fork is like drawing a green circle and trying to sell it at the price of Malevich‚Äôs Black Square. <br><br>  The history of the Auroracoin (AUR) coin is also indicative.  The organizers of the project made a payment system with a large pre-mein.  Artificially supported the stock price corresponding to the Icelandic krone, and distributed coins to all residents of Iceland in the hope that people would use these coins along with kroons, and a crypto-economy will appear in a single country.  We did not have to wait long for the result: people immediately sold their coins for kroons, thus emptying the course support fund, leaving the project organizers to manage the discounted coins at their own discretion. <br><br>  The meaning of creating your own fork is to initially deposit coins into your pocket for free, and then raise the price and get super-profit.  Other reasonable reasons are hard to find.  People will start using these or other cryptomonettes only at the moment when they completely trust the system.  And for this, several conditions must come together: <br><br><ul><li>  historically confirmed success of the project; </li><li>  the economy that uses these coins for some purpose; </li><li>  fully public blockchain without restrictions; </li><li>  the scattered distribution of coins in the masses; </li><li>  the ability to analyze the code on the subject of "bookmarks"; </li><li>  the ability to build nodes independently from the source; </li><li>  fundamental absence of privileged financial participants. </li></ul><br>  Naturally, Emer has these properties. <br><br>  So, you decide to create your fork and a new coin.  Consider the pros and cons of this step.  Compare the use of your coins with the coins of Emercoin: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Act </th><th>  Own coin </th><th>  Emercoin </th></tr><tr><td>  Creation of coins and infrastructure </td><td>  Worth the money and time.  Payments are non-refundable </td><td>  Free and already </td></tr><tr><td>  Support </td><td>  Worth the money and time.

Blockchain Emer can be used both for storing and shipping credit units (coins), and for non-monetary services. <br><br>  Emer is often compared to the Ethereum platform.  They focus on smart contracts, going beyond the usual payment system.  Emercoin is not a direct competitor to Ethereum.  Our goal is industrial applications where reliability and stable work are first required, and only then untested experimental innovations.  Consider the differences between Emer and Ether: <br><table><tbody><tr><th>  Property </th><th>  Emercoin </th><th>  Ethereum </th></tr><tr><td>  Smart contracts on turing-compatible code </td><td>  Not.  The inability to manage deferred payments.  The impossibility of arbitrary malicious code, increased reliability. </td><td>  There is.

We will not dwell on the differences, but focus on unique services specific to the Emer. Platform. <br><br>  The following non-monetary services have already been created and are in commercial operation.  This distinguishes the Emer platform from many other platforms that mostly trade in promises. <br><br><h3>  Emercoin Services </h3><br>  EMCSSH is a worldwide public key infrastructure for managing distributed networks. <br><br>  Thanks to the storage of public keys and access control lists, the administration of networks in the blockchain is more secure and convenient.  This completely eliminates the possibility of the common man-in-the-middle (MIM) hacker attack, and the problem of the ‚Äúunified administrator‚Äù is also solved. <br><br>  Publications: <br><br>  <a href="https://cryptor.net/kriptovalyuty/pod-kapotom-emercoin-chast-3-emcssh-infrastruktura-publichnyh-klyuchey-vsemirnogo">Under the hood Emercoin.</a>  <a href="https://cryptor.net/kriptovalyuty/pod-kapotom-emercoin-chast-3-emcssh-infrastruktura-publichnyh-klyuchey-vsemirnogo">Part 3. emcSSH.</a>  <a href="https://cryptor.net/kriptovalyuty/pod-kapotom-emercoin-chast-3-emcssh-infrastruktura-publichnyh-klyuchey-vsemirnogo">Worldwide public key infrastructure</a> . <br>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/hashflare/blog/263750/">Emcssh - simple digital key management</a> . <br><br>  Applications: <br><br>  <a href="http://hashcoins.ru/">HashCoins</a> - management of an array of servers in their data centers. <br>  Emercoin - project infrastructure management. <br><br><h3>  EMCSSL + InfoCard.
