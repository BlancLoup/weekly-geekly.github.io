  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Using MS Word to manage materials in Wordpress</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uc/wg/vb/ucwgvblwfashrb_vzzsn3nldohw.jpeg"></div><br><br>  Today, to promote a website through SEO (Search Engine Optimization - setting up a resource for search engine results), you need to make high-level materials.  Content must be unique, useful and optimized for search engine requests. <br><br><ul><li>  Uniqueness helps to be seen by search engines. </li><li>  The quality (literacy, structure, design) and the usefulness of the materials is assessed by both readers and search engines (the time spent by the user on your page is interpreted by search engines as interesting content for the public). </li><li>  Optimization is needed because  All of the above will not work if you do not get into the top 10 of the issue at least for some search queries. </li></ul><br>  The right way to meet all these criteria is to create copyright material specifically for your site (you can write yourself, you can order from agencies).  I went the way of writing articles in my own hand and in the process of writing I developed for myself a convenient instrumental scheme, which I want to talk about. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Wordpress </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/893/de8/bd5/893de8bd57b8411e9718eaf47c30b3c3.png"></div><br>  My site on Wordpress, because  its popularity is growing and it is already a standard CMS.  At first I wrote the lyrics right there.  Over time, I felt how uncomfortable it was to type texts on the web: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  the editor itself slows down, it happens that the browser crashes and I lose data, sometimes hosting is tupit; </li><li>  in the SEO process, you need to monitor the number of words, check the spelling, check the occurrences of keywords (no more than 2% per word), and this all requires additional plug-ins that affect the speed of Wordpress; </li><li>  I also needed to keep a history of changes, because  painstakingly created content needs to be protected and versioned, and this also loads the CMS. </li></ul><br><h2>  MS Word </h2><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d8/c3c/32f/8d8c3c32f4c94bc386695ef4b6b12547.png"></div><br>  The thought immediately came to mind about using MS Word as a tool for writing materials.  Here and spell check, and language, and independence from the network and it is convenient to give the materials for correction if necessary.  It is convenient to do color-coded keywords in order to see the current SEO text optimization, which should not be displayed in the published material.  MS Word file is generally a standard of document circulation - it is much easier for it to find any powerful tools depending on needs. <br><br>  The advantages of using Word for me are: <br><br><ul><li>  Reducing the load on the CMS (disable versioning and the minimum set of plug-ins for Wordpress). </li><li>  Increased reliability of storage of materials due to the use of backups, clouds, etc.  means. </li><li>  A rich toolkit, especially useful to me: <br><br><ul><li>  spellchecking; </li><li>  counting the number of all and keywords; </li><li>  comments; </li><li>  review of materials; </li><li>  view differences from previous versions; </li><li>  Writing convenient macros for auto-correcting text. </li></ul><br></li><li>  Higher availability of our materials: local storage, preservation in any type of cloud and the ability to work with the material in the absence of the Internet. </li></ul><br><h2>  Automatic transfer of materials from MS Word to Wordpress </h2><br>  First, through Copy / Paste, I transferred the materials of the articles - Wordpress specifically supports this <a href="https://ru.support.wordpress.com/microsoft-word">kind of transfer from MS Word</a> , which they are talking about officially.  Then, separately inserted the title, removed links to articles that were not yet written, inserted pictures, added categories, keywords, SEO attributes.  Sometimes when copying, words were lost (bugs, where without them) and I had to carefully check the entire text again. <br><br>  After several such iterations, I got bored, tried to make a publication from Word itself, he was also imprisoned for such actions.  By the way, the Internet is full of material on how it is done.  But in this case, it retains all the color markings and all the same problems as above remain.  I started searching for Wordpress plugins that would conveniently import docx documents.  I tried several - but in fact they only make analogs of manual Copy \ Paste. <br><br>  As a result, I made my own <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/seraphinite-post-docx-source">plugin for Wordpress</a> , which automates all of the above actions - and it‚Äôs convenient to work with pictures and do markup. <br><br>  Here is an example of formatting the text that I use: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6a/4c4/679/a6a4c46799ea461c949775a8f0248132.png"></div>  Zoom <br><br>  Key words are highlighted, comments are used, there are links to future unpublished materials.  Links to other related articles are known to contribute both to SEO promotion and ease of navigation by the end reader. <br><br>  All materials for the site are stored in a structural form in Dropbox.  I make pictures with links instead of embedded ones so that MS Word does not distort the quality of the source when resizing. <br><br>  Now it‚Äôs too lazy to copy each article separately in Wordpress - I want to publish in bundles.  Those.  I worked, changed a few articles and made a general upload to the site (commit to CMS).  I will think about the creation of tools. <br><br><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  In fact, it turned out a whole approach to managing the site materials.  I keep the source code where it is convenient, I modify it with a standard and very common toolkit and when ready I automatically publish it in the CMS. <br><br>  I would appreciate any comments and advice - maybe I did not find something or missed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311420/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311420/</a></p>
