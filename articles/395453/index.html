      For the money that it is sold as an intercom, it makes sense to buy it just as a tablet.  This can not afford to produce only in one country.  Hence the disappointing assumption of ‚Äúgolimom China‚Äù, and you will not have to wait for useful applied functions?  But we are not a computer company, so we will continue the main research from the point of view of home security, which he somehow fell under the description of. <br><br>  <b>He is alive!</b> <br>  I do not know how that guy felt that he was loading the security OS, when there were no cameras on it yet, but I almost dropped the tablet from my hands, having looked into distant space.  I, who since the days of CCTV are professionally engaged in video surveillance, it is difficult to surprise with the image from video cameras, but this action is impressive!  At least at the beginning of the download, when the system self-tuning occurs: dozens of types of structural video detection flash on the screen, scanning images of the observed objects.  And then, when <i>a small video with some unusual moment caught ‚Äúby the hand‚Äù is suddenly born from the video stream in front of your eyes.</i>  Like you attend childbirth.  No, it looks more like an easel that paints without an artist, such as the surrounding landscapes themselves fall on the canvas.  (Let's leave a video demonstration for an article about video analytics.) <br><br>  In general, the initial self-tuning mode can be turned off, but the developers apparently knew that they would be skeptical about the device - they turned the insides to the show.  Only they did not think that the dust in the eyes of a specialist causes even more skepticism: it looks fancy, the score "5" from Spielberg.  Lana, have some coffee and continue ... <br><br>  <b>I found a thief!</b> <br>  Turning around for a pre-cooked cup, I once again discover that it is empty.  Dub ... minutes have not passed!  Who is so brave in our office that you dig up my divine drink?  I tolerated a couple of weeks, but it‚Äôs time to go to Bublikov - he doesn‚Äôt respect me the most.  Sorry, let us leave personal, we will continue to analyze what the video analyst stated in the tablet intercom is analyzing, sorry for the tautology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/987/88a/539/98788a539f5248dc89bb1d884e0f2863.jpg"><br><br>  We look at the screen: In the cell where the coffee was standing, everything was already stolen before us!  But on the Video Analytics Panel, the video with the movement of the hands of that very moment constantly revolves, like, no, no longer tyril, but just culturally poured, my coffee.  I am defining, because my hands are from a girl.  Double click on them - the video unfolds to the full camera view ... <br><br>  And a beautiful girl!  Sorry, it was personal again about our current topic: the ‚Äútablet phone‚Äù did not just record the movement in the visibility of the cameras, he identified and brought an event into a separate panel that he considered new or unusual (then we‚Äôll return to these terms in the video analytics article).  If I had only recorded it in the archive, I wouldn‚Äôt even go there, but here, right in front of you, the same movie is constantly spinning on the screen, as the girl takes my coffee (by the way, I don‚Äôt mind).  Everything is clear at first sight!  Like love, sorry, spring again, or summer?  Wow! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/313/277/e18/313277e187244686a261a03e1ed523eb.jpg"><br>  <i>Sorry for the mess on the table!</i> <br><br>  In addition to showing live cameras, a tablet video intercom (LDPE, omit the name) holds up to 1000 recent events on a special scale with scrolling.  Despite the mess in my workplace, at a glance you can understand what is happening around and happening.  The latter is very important for security, because the present time is always lost time, <b>no one NOW will stand in front of cameras</b> for you to be noticed and call the police.  It is more important to see the preparatory activities that occur only briefly in front of the cameras, so it is unlikely to notice them even with a careful look during a long look. <br><br>  <b>Cut, zoom and slow down!</b> <br>  The rapid movement of the LDPE not only recorded and looped, but also slowed down twice to examine in detail fine motor skills.  If you take out a wallet from your pocket in a second, then on the LDPE you can see slowly and in detail what kind of somersaults draw dexterous fingers.  But this is trivial compared to the fact that not the entire 2 megapixel camera is shown, on which this hand is difficult to notice, but only that part of the screen where this unauthorized action takes place.  Naturally, this zone unfolds in the entire camera when you click your finger on it - and you already see the video in the full camera view. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/231/8d4/53b/2318d453bbb14fef9f81d1495133028b.jpg"><br><br>  Such a technology, which the manufacturer called " <b>sculptural video surveillance</b> " (such as cutting off all unnecessary), is cool not only to attract attention, but also to save space on a small screen.  As is also true for large monitors, instead of a 16-megapixel camera compressed into a matchbox, you are shown the same box, but with useful and understandable information. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/744/78a/160/74478a16089c46e98eb44be2f02831f8.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Do not go into the settings, trust the car!</b> <br>  In fact, I have not yet looked at the insides - video processing technologies demonstrate themselves without touching.  I asked the person who connected the cameras, did he set up the video analytics and is it difficult?  "Well no!  The manufacturer does not recommend changing anything, ‚Äùhe heard in response.  Oh, this is always the Russian "yes, no"!  That's what he said? <br><br>  Nevertheless, there are a lot of settings for all sorts, you need to spend a year on their description.  But at the beginning of the manual, it is engraved: " <b>This system does not require any settings</b> , except for connecting cameras and choosing a good view of their review. All its settings are under the administrator's password and are intended for those who wish to expand staffing capabilities and have the appropriate security qualifications for this. <b>video analytics algorithms are based on self-learning!</b> ... When you first connect may be some inaccuracies srabotok eventually algorithms adapt to the rhythm of life on your site. in this case, you are always  You can change the severity level of video analytics in one direction or another by changing the position of the slider "Severity". <br><br>  <b>Many cameras, and what!</b> <br>  When you open the door to a friend or neighbor, you can see only the front part of it in an ordinary intercom.  And on the side - a couple more uninvited guests who will enter with him.  Now there are models of classic intercoms, to which two and four cameras can be connected, but they are only viewed by switching.  Considering that the video signal is not initialized immediately, you will not be able to do this when your close people are waiting for you.  For security purposes, <b>it is very important to view the entire area in which the caller to your door is located, at least from two sides - at an angle of 90 degrees: front and side</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f14/af4/aa6/f14af4aa6d5c4aed9a4a27e6d9484dfb.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8aa/2f7/982/8aa2f7982385439d8969e1b638337dea.jpg"><br><br>  Moreover, the <b>security is not the current time, but the previous one</b> .  Ordinary intercoms are activated only by the call button and do not provide any video analytics for analyzing the history of the ‚Äúpreparatory‚Äù events. <br><br>  <u>To safely leave the apartment or house, you need to view the entire path of movement from a private dwelling to a crowded place.</u>  <u>Most crimes are committed right here, near you and far from witnesses.</u>  <u>In an apartment building, this is the staircase near the elevator (in both directions), the entrance to the staircase, the staircase in front of the apartment on both sides.</u>  <u>In a private house - all the way from the front door to the gate with adjacent corners.</u>  <u>In general, you need at least 4 cameras, and in the cottage more.</u> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c31/593/e30/c31593e3016f422580d2a8a0b891e9d1.jpg"><br><br>  Ordinary intercoms are also limited by resolution.  The old CCTV format is inferior to megapixel cameras.  If in the narrow entrance he is somehow justified, then on the territory of the house - just powerless.  In general, I already want to drive a nail into the vividness of video intercoms supplied to our market.  In almost all of them, the screens are completely wide (9x16), and the cameras for them are standard (3x4).  The stretched image distorts the already non-super image.  How did this get used in Russia? <br><br>  If we discard all the intelligence of LDPE, then this is already just an excellent video intercom, because it <b>connects any cameras, including high resolution ones</b> .  At the same time, not only all possible and impossible aspect ratios are available, but also all kinds of panoramas, clippings, and overlays.  You build the interface for your loved one.  <b>It is possible to show a long wall or passage not by a set of disparate cameras, but by a single video window - a panorama, which greatly simplifies understanding!</b> <b><br></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f6f/417/8e3/f6f4178e35da40c7836f262ab6d2e301.jpg"><br><br>  At the same time, we know that cameras often capture more than half of the useless screen area: at the top of the sky, at the bottom of the grass, on the left is someone else's garbage bin.  In the "Tablets" interface, it is possible to cut only useful areas for viewing.  This saves space on the screen, and saves your attention to useless areas.  You're not going to count the clouds, are you?  And they usually fall into a holistic resolution, especially a multi-megapixel camera. <br><br>  Summarizing what was said, the <b>small screen covers a large area and only in the case</b> , as our admin put it. <br><br>  <b><a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ip-concierge/blog/275426/">Safe to leave the house, so you want</a> !</b> <br>  Again, the usual intercom shows the camera only after pressing the call, at the exit - the screen is black.  Of course, you will say that you can turn it on.  But you will not do this every time before leaving, this is the way a person works.  The tablet in the regular functionality is a non-fading screen.  Of course, it is possible to configure the inclusion of the event - if there is something important for the past, for example, half an hour - in this case, before opening the door, you see the included screen and the latest events on it.  But what's the point of putting it out at all?  It consumes a little, shines only as a light in the hallway (so as not to miss the door to the toilet at night), does not make noise, does not irritate - so, a small picture on the wall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71e/f3e/5f2/71ef3e5f215046cba6fbace76f80a7b3.jpg"><br><br>  But passing by, with one glance you plunge into the history of important events: who approached the door for the past 24 hours, how much the daughter returned from the disco, with whom the son came home ... A whole series of problems can be calculated and solved even <b>at the stage of their conceiving development</b> .  One stumbling stranger nearby is an accident.  Several similar cases in the last period - you are herded.  In order to find these moments, and most importantly, to tie them together, there is a ‚ÄúOperational Panel‚Äù in the Tablet.  And it is necessary to talk about it separately, this is a storehouse of information, as a simple movement of the finger you can build a criminal pattern (in the next articles). <br><br>  Even without doing anything, when you exit you will clearly see the entire history of recent events around your home or throughout your entire outing.  No one will stand in front of the cameras, but no one will be able to hide without passing in front of the cameras.  These moments are hidden - and there is the most valuable thing in this implementation of video analytics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73b/da7/7e6/73bda77e670e4d1a876c10be8bea494e.jpg"><br><br>  Hanging the screen right in front of the entrance door, you can get all the information with a random look while you unlock the lock.  No unnecessary movements and research - everything has been done for you for a long time! <br><br>  <b>Safe to get home, do not die with ustatku!</b> <br>  Who would have thought that the action of the stationary system extends to the approach from the outside.  Special mobile application " <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ip-concierge/blog/276096/">GEO-alarm</a> " determines that you are coming to the house, and warns you of the potential danger of dropping video clips of recent workings, if any. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/640/539/20c/64053920cfdf4786b89c7546447959b0.jpg"><br><br>  If they don‚Äôt exist and the phone doesn‚Äôt bother you, you know for sure that no one has broken into your house, hid at the entrance, and is not waiting for your appearance.  Funny  Alas, according to statistics, 80% of murders occur in or near their homes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ad/844/ddc/4ad844ddcd774e2fa05bd5acee615f1b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>And done under the Russian bandos!</b> <br>  It‚Äôs impossible to tell all the functions of this portable device, you have to spend your whole life.  And it was no joke, the Russian guys sculpt security algorithms for more than a decade.  They are distinguished from China by a mentality - designed ‚Äúfor their own‚Äù villains with a Russian gangster soul, not a single overseas vehicle catches them.  And, especially, the Chinese cameras-eyes for glass doors. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06d/3c7/874/06d3c78743d34004b682ee10ac9c647c.jpg"><br><br>  The criminal situation in Russia can grow from scratch, and not only during long preparations.  In such a device, behavioral logic is integrated, capable of analyzing people's behavior and responding adequately enough, moreover, in a dynamic mode that is always adjusted to new conditions.  What does it mean?  For me, the fact that she is always ready to stop, if she sees that the attacker stops his criminal actions, and vice versa, she is always ready to fight back if the bad guy did not understand the warnings. <br><br>  According to its setting, it is simple to stupid: you simply select the devices listed in the base, give them human formulations from the already prepared list, insert the already prepared conditions for their implementation - and <b>all in the spirit of the drop-down menus, where you just need to make a choice from the proposed description</b> .  But such programming is simple only from the point of view of computer use, it is necessary to understand how the crime behaves and how it differs from the passerby, i.e.  A good forensic expert is required who will develop a threat model. <br><br>  Well, we exaggerate a little, for example, the ‚Äú <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/ip-concierge/blog/276942/">chain</a> ‚Äù algorithm described in the previous article is quite simple - at least, as stated by local readers.  Incidentally, there was a question: how to organize a reaction if you were attacked in your own apartment.  In the tablet intercom just have the answer.  If such circumstances are revealed, he can independently explain to the villain that how much, even if the owner is already sitting tied up and with a gag in his mouth.  To say in a human voice that everything is recorded.  Prove it by showing the record on your monitor.  Additionally, turn on the TV - and there to show that there is no doubt.  Read a sentimental lecture on how bad it is to be a bad boy.  Activate self-defense devices.  AND‚Ä¶ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/12d/69a/234/12d69a2345934a0096832585072e1d6e.jpg"><br><br>  If anyone is interested, in the next article we can describe in more detail the user language of behavioral logic.  Vote down! <br><br>  <b>The real intellect!</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/591/647/363/5916473639664d5181dad6a50c5bd96c.jpg"><br><br>  Well, it would be foolish to write such a long article if at the end there was not a bit of advertising that is allowed to "regular customers".  Only about intelligence - it was not an advertisement, it is really real. <br><br>  If you can‚Äôt program anti-crime algorithms or don‚Äôt want to delve into all the intricacies of criminal life, which turned out to be by chance - well, you just live in Russia, at your service around the clock - <a href="http://ip-concierge.com/">Ipikonsier</a> .  Constantly or on an alarming event, a real person with real human intelligence will monitor problem situations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bae/290/c60/bae290c609034b1b85ad2bc7d7a916b8.jpg"><br><br>  If necessary, he will inform your authorized persons or to ‚Äúwhere necessary‚Äù that you need emergency assistance, enter into negotiations with attackers (the tablet has speakers), hold anti-criminal measures (the tablet has access to coercive devices). <br><br>  If you need to open the door to an unfamiliar plumber, first press the button - Ipikonierzh immediately connects to the situation in question and will follow both: on cameras and on video analysis.  At night, the same tablet intercom can be used to monitor the car at home.  At your entrance or on your site will always be quiet and calm, if Ipikonierzh takes up the cause.  Well, of course, not immediately, in one of the articles we will tell you how the tenants pasted in their porch pictures of hooligan elements that were revealed by our operators.  After a couple of months (not long), the ugliness stopped.  And they stopped stealing apples in the collective garden after ... <br><br>  <i>We hope we still have a lot to say, but the promised video analytics is next in line, and, if you wish, behavioral logic.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6bc/657/0fe/6bc6570feb2f4b898efd50297e39cac9.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395453/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395453/</a></p>
