This was announced in October by the Minister of Health. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/282254/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/48a/813/efe/48a813efec094ecd8449f93ceb1c2f58.jpg"></a> <br><br>  For me, the news about a medicine that effectively prevents HIV infection came as a surprise - as I think it will be for many of you: everything that most of us know about HIV is still exhausted by Zemfira's line ‚Äúyou have AIDS - and that means we will die ".  And even this news itself, although dated October 21, passed unnoticed in runet.  On "Giktayms" - the first exclusive material on this topic in Russian. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By medical standards, Truvada is still practically a startup: the drug was developed by Gilead Sciences and approved for use by the FDA in 2004.

    <blockquote>  Tenofovir / emtricitabine, known under the trade name Truvada, is a combination of two antiretroviral drugs used to treat and prevent HIV infection.  On July 16, 2012, the Food and Drug Administration recommended the use of the tenofovir / emtricitabine combination for the prevention of HIV infection. <br>  - <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580/%25D1%258D%25D0%25BC%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">Wiki</a></i> </blockquote><br>  Reading such news, first of all you expect a dirty trick: not in a lottery, but in cards, and did not win, but lost.  But if this is a conspiracy, then global: Numerous studies show the high effectiveness of Truvada in HIV prevention.  The 2012 article states that the risk of HIV infection <a href="http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/4/151/151ra125">is reduced by 76‚Äì99%</a> , depending on the number of pills per week (maximum effectiveness is achieved with daily intake).  The Washington Post last year <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2015/09/04/in-new-study-hiv-prevention-pill-truvada-is-startlingly-100-percent-effective/">cited</a> three more studies in which the effectiveness of Truvada ranged from 86 to 100%. <br><br>  The drug is used in the health care of several countries, including the United States, Canada, France and South Africa.  Israel, at the very end of October of this year, <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4871075,00.html">announced</a> the launch of a pilot project, similar to the Norwegian one, by its results, a decision will be made on withdrawing and not bringing the program to the national level.  However, the situation is not everywhere unclouded: for example, the decision of the Ministry of Health of England to refuse to purchase Truvada caused <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-3504875/Charities-slam-NHS-England-U-turn-plans-roll-HIV-wonder-drug.html">an uproar in the midst of charitable organizations</a> . <br><br>  The head of the Israeli HIV Research Center Kaplan, Professor Steger, <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4871075,00.html">cites the</a> main argument of opponents of the free distribution of Truvada: <br><br><blockquote>  This is an ethical and philosophical question: should society pay for sex without a condom? </blockquote><br>  However, he also notes: ‚ÄúThe same can be said about smokers with lung cancer.  We do not have to prevent it, but it would be worth a try. ‚Äù <br><br>  In Norway, the struggle of lobbyists to become the first country in which Truvada is distributed free of charge among risk groups - gay, bi and transgender - took two years.  But now their example should push other countries.  At the same time, this is not even news about ‚Äúthey have the money for this‚Äù - in the end, as Business Insider <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/norway-offers-hiv-drug-prep-free-2016-10">writes</a> , ‚ÄúHIV prevention is cheaper and safer to treat it‚Äù, and the same professor Steger <a href="http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4871075,00.html">remarked</a> that, although the cost of prevention can reach thousands shekels (multiplied by 17 $ at the current rate) per month, the treatment of the carrier during the life can cost millions. <br><br><h2>  What about us? </h2><br>  I think many have heard the news of the announcement of an HIV epidemic in Yekaterinburg.  After clarifying the information, it turned out that this is not entirely news: the situation itself was long ago - now only public attention has been attracted to it.  In fact, the epidemic threshold of 1% <a href="http://gtrk-omsk.ru/news/219589/">has already been</a> exceeded <a href="http://gtrk-omsk.ru/news/219589/">in twenty regions</a> . <br><br>  In general, across the country, the <a href="http://www.rbc.ru/politics/25/10/2016/580f3d3f9a794787b7008782">number of people infected with HIV has</a> reached 1 million.  Since 2006, Russia has seen an annual increase in the number of new HIV infections by an average of 10% per year, according to the government.  At this rate, the epidemic threshold for HIV incidence will be overcome nationwide in 4 years. <br><br><h2>  A spoon of tar </h2><br>  Of course, like any medicine, Truvada has side effects - not only <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2584%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580/%25D1%258D%25D0%25BC%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD">physiological</a> , but also social: as it spreads, more and more people <a href="http://www.straight.com/life/804901/sex-workers-worry-hiv-prevention-drug-truvada-raises-spectre-clients-refusing-wear">refuse to use condoms in principle</a> , although these pills do not protect against other sexually transmitted diseases. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398835/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398835/</a></p>
