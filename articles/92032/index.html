  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sinking ship</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Generally, it happened historically that my feelings for the Palm company are very warm.  And, unconditionally warm.  Apparently this means that for me, Palm is already in history.  We are all pleased to remember different Commodore, modem times and watching the first high-quality porn movie in the network.  Somewhere in the same semantic row there are also devices that were once released on the company's conveyors.  I remember my first Zire, brought from Germany, its damage and headache associated with its repair ... old toys. <br><br>  However, a large and aggressive business is not at all like digging in a sandbox.  And Palm, trying to be reborn, again burns like a phoenix.  Talented, recently hired workers are leaving their posts, which clearly indicates only one thing - Palm begins its run down in a spiral.  And the landing is unlikely to be soft, no matter how hard <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm,_Inc.">John Rubinstein</a> hoped. <br><br>  Two weeks ago, the company lost its marketing director; today, the person responsible for cooperation with operators has left his post.  All this, of course, is not yet critical, but the first bell has already been heard and the viewers are beginning to slowly slow down for the performance.

      The company's debts and the inability to raise turnover to the expected level forced Palm to view takeover as the only way to keep the brand.  And even Rubinstein dropped one not very positive phrase: ‚ÄúI could start in October with Verizon, make a shorter exclusive contract with Sprint and the world would be completely different today.  That is, it is easy to say such things. ‚Äù  The current CEO of the company literally signs his own inability to change the state of affairs, he is well aware that the word ‚ÄúI can‚Äù does not work in the past tense. <br><br>  Of the four potentially interested in buying Palm companies in the audience today there is only one left - Lenovo.  Strongly refusing to give any comments during the negotiations, but <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/technology-media-telco-SP/idUSHKU00226420100423">HTC‚Äôs position</a> seems to me much more reasonable: ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt find enough points of contact, the deal wouldn‚Äôt bring mutual benefits.‚Äù  To tell the truth, it seems to me that neither Lenovo nor Huawei will see anything good in such a perspective.  What remains?  Slow death to the fanfare of financial results and the hooting of Apple, Microsoft and Google fans? <br><br>  All this is nothing more than food for thought.  Facts are not enough for conclusions, and the conclusions themselves would be too far-reaching.  Still, it's nice to think about something in the past tense and, obviously, not for me alone. <br><br>  via <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5523650/palms-execs-are-jumping-ship-as-fast-as-its-potential-buyers%3Futm_source%3Dfeedburner%26utm_medium%3Dfeed%26utm_campaign%3DFeed:%2Bgizmodo/full%2B(Gizmodo)">Gizmodo</a> &amp; <a href="">ArsTechnica</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/92032/">https://habr.com/ru/post/92032/</a></p>
