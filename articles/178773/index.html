All of us, unwittingly, became living witnesses of how <nobr>the ‚Äúdrug‚Äù</nobr> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158367/">site was closed about the game EVE Online</a> (which described the use of fictional chemicals to fictional characters), and <nobr>for ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù -</nobr> innocuous humor, like an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175205/">article from Absurdopedia</a> or <a href="http://lleo.me/dnevnik/2013/03/18.html">Kaganov's work</a> (and in the so-called In the real world, under the pretext of child suicide, the death note manga in the Sverdlovsk region is <a href="http://www.e1.ru/news/spool/news_id-385971.html">withdrawn from the sale</a> , although the entire region is named after one of the organizers of the Emperor‚Äôs murder of children, but nobody cares about it, <nobr>‚Äúextremism‚Äù is</nobr> national  non-targeted anti-alcohol propaganda (# 1568 in the Federal <a href="http://minjust.ru/ru/extremist-materials">List of Extremist Materials</a> ).  As for "child pornography" (in fact, intended for fully adult pedophiles), then the need to combat its <i>consumption</i> on the Internet (instead of fighting its <i>production</i> in the real world, inevitably associated with the actual corruption of real children, for whom unlicensed distributions on the Internet just represent a direct economic threat, deprived of funding) is not quite obvious - <nobr>and the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/147653/">question</a></nobr> asked about this to the minister turned out to be ignored. <br><br>  The heart-rending cries of indignation caused by the closure of several sites for reasons that are not controversial have remained unanswered.  Promotion of the repression flywheel continues - now not only websites, but also people will be closing.  Where it leads?  I think that the pursuit of fictional works, similar to the above-mentioned cases of fantastic ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù and painted ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù, will continue.  This can be successfully guessed not only by extrapolating the events that have occurred, but also by drawing an analogy with foreign countries.  Old-timers Habrahabr will certainly remember that the consequences of arbitrary and non-public replenishment of the black list (the contents of which are hidden from society under the pretext of non-propaganda) I discussed at Habrahabr <nobr><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/54957/">in the summer of 2009</a></nobr> using the example of Australia.  And it came true, although not in full.  And now about how this arbitrariness may look like when it begins to resort to real prison terms, I suggest looking at the example of another country in the southern hemisphere - New Zealand.  There, only recently <a href="http://russian.rt.com/article/7857">released from prison</a> (but still under threat of <b>ten years of</b> probation) a citizen who posted on the Internet <nobr>only</nobr> anime about the sex life of fictional (and only partially human-like) characters - elves and fairies, which, thanks to the peculiarities of Japanese animation the eyes, large heads, etc.) and the peculiarities of the Japanese voice acting (subtle voices, bright emotions) seemed to the experts to be ‚Äúsimilar to children‚Äù.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  And it's good that we are talking about at least the image of sex, although between fictional (painted) characters.  And what can happen when it comes to the experts that almost any (even the most everyday) action in the anime can undergo so much eroticism that it becomes some kind of metaphor (symbol) of sex?  A symbol can be quite obvious or not particularly obvious - it means that everything will depend on the good or bad will or prejudice of the expert in court.  Kiss on the lips <nobr>in "Sekirei".</nobr>  Kiss the ring on the hand <nobr>in "Rozen</nobr> Maiden".  Brushing teeth <nobr>in "Nisemonogatari".</nobr>  Haircut <nobr>in ‚ÄúDansai</nobr> Bunri no Crime Edge‚Äù.  Any fan of anime (and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150007/">as a result of the survey,</a> up to one third of Habrakhabr participants will be recalled) will easily recall a <nobr>couple of</nobr> examples of the same kind. <br><br>  The sad thing is this: the aforementioned New Zealand pursuit of painted sex is overshadowed by the aforementioned Sverdlovsk pursuit of painted suicide.  This news is closer to us than New Zealand - and therefore more significant.  A well-known writer (and oppositionist) Chkhartishvili in his work ‚Äú <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B8_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D1%2583%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE">The Writer and Suicide</a> ‚Äù managed to acquaint the Russian public with such a Japanese phenomenon <nobr>as a <b>syndrome</b></nobr> <nobr>(‰∏≠) -</nobr> double suicide of lovers, made under the pressure of circumstances.  Experts are left to add up two and two in order to, if they wish, find, for example, a failed synju through self-sinking of water lovers in the anime ‚ÄúYosuga no Sora‚Äù (and not even <nobr>in ‚ÄúToradora!‚Äù),</nobr> As well as a failed self-immolation in love <nobr>with ‚ÄúAku no</nobr> Hana.  If the legislation continues to insist that only information that cannot harm the fragile psyche of juvenile silly people should get on the Internet, then the courts, of course, will not forget that in today's world, double suicide is more dangerous because it gives such a couple confidence in eternal unity and in mutual fidelity and in unintelligible love that family life could never give, full of almost daily opportunities for quarrels and for disappointments in each other. <br><br>  Finally, I will answer this question: why do I think that the persecution of fictional works with non-child stories on the Internet will begin with the pursuit of contemporary Japanese culture?  <nobr>First,</nobr> because <nobr>‚Äúit has already begun‚Äù</nobr> in the Sverdlovsk region (and in New Zealand), which means it can continue - for example, in the plot of ‚ÄúDeath Note‚Äù we see such repeated instances of involuntary suicide under the influence of supernatural power, the analogue of which easily found in many other Japanese animes, including very exciting stories (Code Geass, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, Chaos; Head, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni, etc.).  <nobr>Secondly,</nobr> ‚Äúproof by contradiction‚Äù: it seems quite obvious that behind the Internet publishers of the Russian classics with a gloomy and tragic finale (Dostoevsky‚Äôs ‚ÄúDemons‚Äù, Tolstoy‚Äôs ‚ÄúAnna Karenina‚Äù, Ostrovsky‚Äôs ‚ÄúThunderstorm‚Äù) queue - in accordance with the famous poem Niemler. <br><br>  Between these two milestones (first and last) there will be a place for many dozens, not even hundreds of sites - and, therefore, for criminal cases against their owners.  Hope for salvation can only those who in advance attended to follow the neoclassical <a href="http://blog.micromarketing.ru/advice/9-point-5-rules-fot-it-business-in-russia/">rules of a safe <nobr>IT-business,</nobr></a> or at least the tactics of the Elusive Joe. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178773/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178773/</a></p>
