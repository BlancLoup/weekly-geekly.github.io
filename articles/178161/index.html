  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Install 3 systems on 1 disk with shared loader</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This story is a special case of the jungle of knowledge that you have to wade if you wish to work freely with several OS on one disk.  Facts show that there is no order in this discipline, and new components introduce, probably their new problems in the order of installation of operating systems.  Perhaps this will give enthusiasts who have not had such experience, a general view that the installation of the OS will not always be simple and unambiguous.  However, the drama in this case is less than in the cases of telecoms, SOSPs, PR and Sberbank.  All one way or another, but solved. <br><br>  There is no set of instructions on how to do the installation - they are all there, already written and scattered across forums and blogs.  By keywords and links you can find everything you need.  The bottom line is that there are no clear instructions.  There are fundamental rules for the construction of partitions on computer disks, standardized back in the 90s.  Depending on the novelty of the bios and the system, problems will always be introduced into a known order, and it is important to be able to search for solutions, approximately knowing the general state of affairs.  With this approach, links were given, and most importantly, how vaguely everything is configured! <br><br>  It so happened that the <b><a href="http://www.3dnews.ru/mobile/640011">Acer Aspire One 756</a></b> subnotebook (Sandy Bridge Celeron 887), originally purchased almost without an OS (Linpus without X installed), had the following operating systems installed (in order of installation): <br>  1) WinXP 32 bit - from an assembly of approximately 720 MB; <br>  2) Win7 64 bit - from some assembly about 2 GB in size; <br>  3) Xubuntu 13.04 64 bit - from a fresh distribution for 800 MB; <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Not all bootable flash drives work </h3><br>  The laptop is quite fresh in time to market (approximately April 2012), and now (in 2013) its newer versions on the Ivy Bridge processor are on sale.  The novelty of solutions and BIOS, support for only new OSs, most likely led to a sum of problems that are practically not observed when working with other computers and laptops.  The difficulties of installing systems through bootable flash drives are noted by many, who did not have the system installed right away and had to look for options.  An example of this notebook is a bright case of such problems, most likely related to the features of the bios of some models.

      All systems booted from boot flash drives, and there was some problem with this, because not all of them could be installed.  At first, many flash drives during installation caused the laptop to hang up as soon as any keyboard key was pressed.  Therefore, the first system installed the one (Win XP), which for some reason was able to boot from a flash drive (visible as a USB-CDROM as opposed to USB-FDD and USB-HDD on other flash drives).  Probably, everything would work from a real USB-CDROM, but buying it for the sake of installing the system is somehow illogical if there are flash drives for this. <br><br>  A laptop, like every device, has its own characteristics.  For example, the memory visible in WinXP was only 2.6 GB, not 3.25 (video memory only takes 128 GB of RAM, so why the system does not see 3.1 GB is a mystery).  In general, for this laptop model, Acer has not released drivers for Win XP and for Linux - only Win7 and Win8.  Drivers were collected in parts as updates for devices included in the computer.  Driver selection took at least 3 days.  As a result, drivers in WinXP could not do something: <br>  1) did not feel the power of the battery - never.  Therefore, the computer was blind to razarayad. <br>  2) the sound disappeared when leaving hibernation.  Therefore, it was necessary to reboot for the appearance of sound (perhaps, the selection and updating of system drivers and sound would correct the situation). <br>  3) the mentioned visible memory is 2.6 GB. <br>  The rest worked: Bluetooth, a well-working touchpad with a lot of settings and without failures, WiFi, webcam and microphone, sound, SD-reader. <br><br>  Initially, the laptop was a Linpus system without a graphical shell.  The disk was split in two and WinXP is installed in the upper part.  The system is installed temporarily, because the amount of available memory for a 32-bit OS was initially insufficient for all applications. <br><br><h3>  Not all Win7 / Win8 assemblies are installed. </h3><br>  With this bouquet it was impossible to stretch for a long time, so at the first opportunity Win7 was put on the second half of the disc as a system supported by the manufacturer.  There were several installation attempts - Win8 first - at the end of the installation a cheerful message that the system could not be installed and should be reinstalled.  And so - 4 times in a row.  With another build by another author - the same (build - also trimmed, 1.9 GB).  But it‚Äôs good that the flash and the way to form the boot record (via Ultra-ISO), which does not hang the computer at the very beginning, are found.  True, those who hung were also formed via Ultra-ISO.  The difference was in the media and their chipsets, and, perhaps, in the choice of the type of copying (USB-HDD with or without plus). <br><br>  Well, with the existing build Win8 (Optim, 1.7 GB) did not work.  We try Win 7 x86 Optim of the same author-collector.  Interestingly, the symptoms are the same - hang up at the end of the download and please reinstall.  Well, for this "iron" is not preserved in the distribution something important.  We take another build - the same Optim, but x86 + x64 (and in the end it was necessary to install x64) - 1.9 GB.  At this time, somehow managed to install.  Total, from several compact assemblies worked one, but there was no need to search and release a large flash for installation.  For the flash, it will be important that the assembly has a system recovery mode - it helps to restore the MBR. <br><br>  After installation, 80% of the drivers worked, but less than half worked well - the video was recognized as a standard monitor, although it could work with a nominal resolution and low speed.  WiFi Atheros caused the biggest problems - only the newest driver version 10 for Win7 x64 came up.  Almost all the drivers had to be downloaded from the network and installed, using both the official support site and some others.  The driver list had to read which of them work under Win7x64.  Sometimes the information was wrong, and the search for the driver continued.  So, for 7 hours, we managed to assemble and install all the drivers for this OS.  The touchpad continued to work very well in this system, which, as we know, is a rarity for touchpads (due to the drivers and their support).  Everything in the system began to work absolutely correctly.  6 GB memory is normally readable (2 + 4 strips, one strap is upgraded).  Although it is also somehow strange, a lot of it is taken by the system - about 1 GB, not counting the programs visible in the task manager.  Perhaps this is necessary, and perhaps there are hidden expenses in excess of video memory, as was observed in WinXP.  But there it was very critical, and in x64 - not very.  Memory can be expanded up to 8, and up to 12 GB, and up to 16. <br><br>  But now, apart from Win7, which has begun to see both disk partitions, you need to install Linux 26 (Ubuntu) on the remaining free 26 GB.  Necessary for specific development tasks, despite the fact that, most likely, there will be some problems with the drivers after the ideal work of Win7. <br><br>  The hardware power of this computer is small - there is a 2-core Celeron, showing in tests the performance of about 60% of the power of average normal laptops.  He is a subnotebook, so you have to pay for compactness and weight.  Catch up the performance will be due to the SSD, which requires a low - 7 mm for this subnotebook.  Therefore, the installation of systems are preliminary, and they may have to be repeated on the SSD. <br><br><h3>  Xubuntu 12 with no flash set, but Xubuntu.13 - no problem </h3><br>  Just on the day of the Linux installation <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/177897/">, Ubuntu 13.04 was released</a> , which was selected in the Xubuntu distribution (800MB).  Unlike the previous attempt to create a bootable flash drive on the previous Xubunu 12, it was launched and installed on a laptop, and the previous one was launched on a stationary computer without problems, but hung at the first press of the keyboard in this laptop.  Probably - this is the problem of supporting the new "iron".  In the new version, the EFI format appeared in the distribution kit, and it was he who could work on the laptop, and the USB-HDD, as usual, could not see in the same boot menu (yes, one flash in the boot device selection menu was seen in 2 options, in 2 lines, and this was observed in the 13th Xubuntu and was not observed in the 12th). <br><br>  What we have with Xubuntu: <br>  1) screen brightness control - is displayed, but the brightness is not adjustable. <br>  2) with WiFi pickup, power, sound and BlueTooth - order.  SD-reader - also automatically mounted. <br>  3) Xfce system settings management is much poorer than in Gnome 3 in the standard package.  Something has to be installed for convenience, but these are parts of the system. <br><br><h3>  Access to 3 OS systems </h3><br>  But the question arose how to now make all 3 systems accessible from the boot menu.  2 systems learned to boot using the <b>EasyBCD</b> loader quite easily.  After installing Win 7, it alone appeared at first when the system was booted, without alternatives.  Its bootloader simply wiped out the WindowsXP MBR (Master Boot Record).  EasyBCD has MBR recovery mechanisms for a number of popular systems.  A few mouse clicks and a few test reboots - and the principle of forming the menu in this program is understandable, although it cannot be said that the interface is simple.  It is somewhat confused by the fact that the program can do a lot, and these advanced features (write your own Grub4dos-based bootloader) need to be reflected. <br><br>  But after upgrading to the 2nd partition of the new Linux system, this bootloader couldn‚Äôt pick up the newly created system as well.  It was probably because the installation process involved creating an MBR for Linux with further installation after a reboot, and under the conditions of 3 partitions and 3 systems, it turned out that I required the presence of a bootloader immediately, and also built in EasyBCD.  Direct transition to the Linux partition showed that there is no boot loader.  The solution was found on the other, unexpected side.  I just started looking for ways to restore Ubuntu.  <b>Boot-Repair</b> program was found to restore Ubuntu boot from Ubuntu Live CD - it was useful to erase a broken (for some reason) Grub2 installed Linux and put the new Grub on top of all the bootloaders. <br><br>  Now there are 2 boot loaders on the disk, which, of course, is unnecessary.  But it is already good that all 3 systems work.  Now, after trying to install Linux into the EasyBCD bootloader via Grub2, we get a successful boot of this bootloader.  By saving EasyBCD in the MBR, we get the desired menu from 3 systems.  With 3 systems it is already possible to work independently, see all their files and develop them by installing programs. <br><br><h3>  Results </h3><br>  In contrast to the trouble-free cases of desktops, which install systems from flash drives and flash drives, and often their hardware is more fully supported at the driver level, budget notebooks may encounter problems that are absent from other computers.  This must be borne in mind when working with the configuration of such laptops. <br><br>  Why there is no desire to understand and make full instructions, full-fledged loaders?  There is a suspicion that we have to contend with individual manifestations of the dampness of bios, which are found more often than cheaper laptop models.  For a good installation, you need to build your bootloader based on Grub4dos (and these are dozens of commands), and at the same time figure out how to build a Grub2 configuration for Linux ‚Äî that is,  become a downloader specialist, learn 1-2 small specialized languages.  Undoubtedly, for this business there are enthusiasts who have passed and will say that it is simple and interesting.  But, unfortunately, it takes a lot of time, when the tasks of using the systems set their own, completely different tasks, and the resource of time and enthusiasm is limited.  It is easier to take and try several well-known installation options and stop at a working one. <br><br>  This is the everyday routine of the user who decided to work with several systems at once.  On specialized forums on systems (OsZone, Ru-Board, ...), dozens of pages are given to problems and solutions in installing systems.  The new "iron", unfortunately, also introduces difficulties in this process.  What worked on desktops yesterday, for some reason, ceases to work (bios, new solutions, new OS) on some laptops.  Some old development ( <a href="http://symon.ru/usr/rus/about.shtml">SyMon</a> ) does not develop.  The search for a solution resembles a walk in a dark forest and a stop on the first successful occasion. <br><br>  References to different cases of installations of several OS. <img src="http://st.habrate.ru/pixel.gif"><br>  * <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EasyBCD">EasyBCD</a> - different OS loader from the Windows partition;  <a href="http://we-it.net/index.php/soft/optimizaciyainastroykaos/104-ustanavlivaem-neskolko-operatsionnykh-sistem-easybcd">Install several operating systems (EasyBCD)</a> (.04.2012); <br>  * <a href="http://savvateev.org/blog/17/">Making a bootable flash drive using grub4dos</a> (June 29, 2010) <br>  * <a href="http://greenflash.su/Grub4Dos/files/links.htm">Links to download grub4dos</a> <br>  * <a href="http://www.unixdoc.ru/index.php%3Fmode%3D2%26podmode%3D1%26arcicle_id%3D62">Install and configure the GRUB bootloader</a> (Unix / Linux) <br>  * <a href="http://www.tux.in.ua/articles/3109">Restore GRUB bootloader in Ubuntu / Linux Mint</a> , <a href="http://ubuntovod.ru/soft/boot-repair.html">Boot-Repair - Recover Ubuntu boot</a> . <br>  * <a href="http://help.ubuntu.ru/wiki/%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_grub">GRUB recovery</a> <br>  * <a href="http://alltheinternet.ucoz.com/load/all_the_download/all_the_download/installjacija_multibuta_bootit_ng/21-1-0-450">Installation of multiboot BootIt NG</a> (04.06.2011) - one of the alternatives of multiboot. <br>  * <a href="http://www.rmprepusb.com/tutorials/grub4dos">GRUB4DOS GUIDE (with videos) - how to make a multi-boot drive (+ examples)</a> (Last updated: 9 March 2013) <br>  * <a href="http://www.cyberforum.ru/drives/thread517901.html">What is GRUB4dos and what it is eaten with, or how to make a bootable USB flash drive</a> (.03.2012) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178161/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178161/</a></p>
