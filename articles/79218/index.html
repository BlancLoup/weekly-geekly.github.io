      I wanted to send documents as a conductor, I thought faster and average reliability, but no, there are much worse links ... <br></blockquote><br><br>  For some reason, 99% of the population of Russia (and, most likely, the whole Earth) got the impression that regular mail is slag, but commercial companies that have nothing to do with mail at all are cool and salvation.  That they, having taken money from a commercial tax, will surely deliver a bag with your precious something to the other end of the Earth, avoiding brakes and hemorrhoids, for which these 99% of the population hate ordinary mail. <br><br>  And only a measly one percent knows that brakes and hemorrhoids are the prerogative of just these, vaunted commercial offices, whose name is DHL, Fedex, UPS, TNT. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  They are not mail!  NOT-POCH-TA! </h2><br>  I don‚Äôt know if all countries have such orders, but in Russia, in Thailand, and (judging by the victims ‚Äôreviews) in the USA, all the staff that arrive from abroad through transport companies settles at international customs terminals, which are only nearby. from major international ports (air, sea, etc.). <br><br>  ‚ÄúNo, well, this is correct, according to the notions, why is this here?‚Äù <del>  goof </del>  potential customer of the company for the delivery of goods.  And this is what the "transport company" ‚â† "postal operator".  I would even say ‚â†‚â†‚â†. <br><br>  As soon as customs does not give the go-ahead and decides that the parcel should be taxed, the difference between DHL and mail is immediately clear (and this happens how often customs officers are such customs officers, this is one of the most muddy professions of this world). <br><br>  Regular, state mail, will deliver you the package straight home (or invite you to pick it up at the post office), and you will pay the fee on the spot.  And that's it!  Everyone is free, everyone goes about their business. <br><br>  The transport company will contact you by phone or email, and tearfully, sympathetically <del>  hanging you noodles </del>  will open your eyes to the inadequacy of customs officers who do not give your package a move.  They will make an offer that is impossible to refuse: assistance in completing the necessary documents for customs clearance.  It is impossible - because to fill out the papers yourself, you need to arrive at the customs terminal (from Uryupinsk to Moscow, for example).  Naturally, for such a generous service, the company will ask for a coin - a mere trifle, only a few tens of dollars.  Some small eGay bought bedset, on which you wanted to save 50% of the price, immediately starts to cost more than if you bought it in a stall across the road. <br><br>  The previous paragraph painted that there are hemorrhoids when using fast delivery from DHLFedexTNTUPS.  And now - about speed.  What, you think, overpay, so at least for 4 days the package will receive?  Like, ‚Äúyou have to pay for the service,‚Äù capitalism, like?  Hell no!  While your coveted IPoop 3D is in the dirtiest corner of the customs terminal, the valiant employees of the transport company will let things go on the brakes with all their might: get lost, ask for time to figure out every child's question (as if you have one, yeah), show a minimum of independence.  By the four days of delivery, without fear, you can add at least two weeks to resolve all issues and final delivery of the package.  4 days = 3 weeks!  Almost Einstein paradoxes of speed ... <br><br>  Actually, we could probably put a big, fat <strong>‚úû</strong> on such services, however, these companies sin not only by brainfacking during customs clearance - they also lose, confuse, deliver in a bad way.  What is worth only a fresh story of my friend, quoted at the beginning of the note! <br><br>  So the game is not worth the candle, the notorious ‚Äúmuch higher‚Äù service ‚Äúfor money‚Äù is nothing but mass hypnosis. <br><br><h2>  My disrespect westerners </h2><br>  There is a popular opinion that ‚Äúonly we can have this, but TAM - no way!‚Äù Here is an approximate line of thought: <br><br>  <em>‚ÄúThe Post of Russia is shitty, they don‚Äôt know how to work, it‚Äôs impossible to use the service, it can only be with us.</em>  <em>This is in the West, mail is super, there people bought today - received it tomorrow.</em>  <em>So, you need to use something western for delivery.</em>  <em>Let's say DHL.</em>  <em>Or even American Fedex.</em>  <em>Oh!</em>  <em>Not delivered, bastards!</em>  <em>Well, it's a Russian branch, this can only be with us.</em>  <em>It's time to dump! ‚Äù</em> <br><br>  Naturally, the closest distance from which the holders of this opinion saw how THEM was 3 meters from the TV screen with the next Hollywood series.  For it is not necessary to go far - complaints from the residents of TAMA <a href="http://www.complaintsboard.com/bycompany/fedex-a438.html">are easy</a> .  After all, from scratch forums with the name <a href="http://www.dhlsucks.net/">dhlsucks.net</a> do not appear! <br><br><h2>  Small FAQ </h2><br>  <em>- If not DHLFedexTNTUPS, then what?</em>  <em>Is it really ordinary mail?</em> <br>  - Well, almost ... Use <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EMS">EMS</a> - express mail service, which is provided all over the world by local postal operators. <br><br>  <em>- The seller from Hong Kong said that DHL is very good and fast, and EMS will be very expensive and inconvenient!</em> <br>  - Lying, son of a bitch.  Most likely, he just does not want to bathe and is trying to persuade you to the version that is more familiar to him.  After all, what does the seller need?  To sell goods, get money, and all this - quickly and without steam.  He will never see your subsequent problems with customs clearance, delivery, receipt, and even if he saw, he is not responsible for them.  Therefore, if tomorrow it will be more convenient for him to offer to send a pigeon iPod, he will offer. <br><br>  <em>- American seller asks: "What is EMS?"</em> <br>  - Everything is different from people ... In the USA, the name EMS is not common.  Their mail is called USPS, one of the options of which is Express Mail International (the same EMS).  By the way, they have a whole bunch of other types of delivery that you still have to deal with.  Here, for example, what and how much is offered for the delivery of a kilogram <del>  heroin </del>  Shipping from USA to Thailand: <br><br> <a href=""><img title="usps_services" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/85c/f8f/855/85cf8f855b389e78cf18fe182ee0b414.png" alt="usps_services" width="480" height="411"></a> <br><br>  <em>- I am trying to track the cargo according to the url, which the sender gave me, it seems that the parcel is frozen at the border!</em>  <em>Oh god, why didn't I choose DHL!</em> <br>  - Since EMS is a decentralized system, then each country has its own local tracking system.  For example, after the cargo has left the United States, you need to track the parcel on the Russian EMS website. <br><br><h2>  Interesting - from commentators </h2><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/malek/" class="user_link">malek</a> : Regular mail will invite the post office to pay a fee (at this time the parcel is in customs), after which it will continue delivery.  At least this is how EMS delivery to St. Petersburg works. <br><br>  Another important difference lies in the amount of this duty.  Upon delivery by regular mail or EMS, 30% of the amount exceeding 10,000 rubles (which is less than 10,000 is not subject to duty).  That is, for goods worth 12,000, you must pay 30% of 2000, which is equal to 600 rubles. <br>  Upon delivery by other DHLFedexTNTUPS, duty is imposed on everything above 5000, with 30% taken from the total cost.  That is, for the same parcel worth 12,000 will have to pay customs to 3600. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/wott/" class="user_link">Wott</a> : A couple of years ago I was constantly confronted with DHL + customs - various engineering samples came to us. <br><br>  It was a complete pi *** q!  The imposition of their services during customs clearance for sickly money, delaying the process, as a result of which money accumulated in storage, permanent tupizm and ignorance of the subject area, because of which the customs clearance could be 2-3 times more expensive. <br><br>  In general, having tried various options - we had our own customs specialists, worked with partners in customs clearance, used the services offered by DHL, it was decided that it was cheaper, in many ways, to send an employee on a business trip and go for some ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù with TC than to have permanent this hemorrhoids. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote> <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/mokaton/" class="user_link">Mokaton</a> : I ordered a couple of devices from different vendors from Hong Kong to St. Petersburg.  Orders were made with a difference of about 10-15 days, I ordered both via EMC, because I know about hemorrhoids with DHLFedexTNTUPS.  But the first order pushed through and got off for the weekend, from which the seller sent his own account via DHL, saying that he had made a mistake and paid for it.  Well, I thought cool, come quickly!  She arrived quickly, indeed, having rounded half of Europe.  But then katavasiya began.  The manager from DHL called me, give me your mail, I will send you the docks, I gave them, I filled the docks in electronic form (they have a plain English letter written in the body of the letter, they say, do not print this letter on paper, so you save nature or the forest! Well, I did not print, but I entered all the data straight into the Word.), I sent it back.  Waiting for the day, the second.  No answer.  I tried to call me on the phone that they gave me, either they don‚Äôt answer or they drop me.  I waited some more.  So a week has passed.  Then the girl calls me again, they say, send us the documents again.  I was a little furious, but said nothing and sent again.  Again, I wait for 2 days, I do not dial up to the manager, but I leave an angry message through the operator and call me back in a day and say that I have not sent everything, I still need passports and my autograph scans.  Itit-bash!  And at once it was impossible to say what I was answered to say, I'm sorry, I forgot.  Sent.  A week has passed again.  Once again I can not get through.  I am writing an angry message through the site to the service of quality control, after a couple of days the building manager calls.  department, very adequate girl.  I once again had to send all the documents to her, then I had to forge a bit of a statement from the bank, because there was not enough information about me.  Vobschem all quickly done and then she re-sent me to the managers of physical.  individuals.  Ohhh, another week has passed!  I have already received the second parcel, which was traveling only 8 days by EMC.  And then finally, DHL deigned to make customs clearance of my package and deliver it to me!  As a result, I received 2 devices at once in one day - from EMS in the morning and from DHL in the evening. <br>  Then, after a couple of days, I received a call from the Quality Assurance Manager and asked to excuse their company for such a long service.  To which I replied that thank you for having done this, but I will never use their services again. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/navion/" class="user_link">navion</a> : Fedex in Russia does not deal with customs in general, and if the price of the cargo exceeds the duty-free limit, it is not accepted for shipment.  <i>From the author: read - if the seller has specified Fedex, as the only supplier, you simply will not be sent an expensive item.</i> </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/79218/">https://habr.com/ru/post/79218/</a></p>
