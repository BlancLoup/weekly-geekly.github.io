My name is Svetlana and from today I am responsible for blogging of the company ‚ÄúBK Soft‚Äù.  But I will not write about the company itself, but about its product - the new SaaS-service SolverMate. <br><br>  Honestly, I do not know why it was me who wrote to write about all the technical features on such a professional resource.  First, I am a philologist without any IT education.  Secondly, philologists even though they are dealing with literature - but still mostly artistic ... Thirdly, my only programming experience is the zodiac horoscope on BASIC at school, when the programs were recorded on audio tapes.  And it‚Äôs absolutely unrealistic to repeat it today - and not only because I couldn‚Äôt find those tapes during the day with fire - I just don‚Äôt remember how it is done at all :)

      <b>So, SolverMate.</b> <br><br>  The full name of our SaaS solution is the customer support system with integrated operational management tools for service delivery.  It is long, but without an English-Russian dictionary it is more or less clear that SolverMate is a computer assistant, like Chip and Dale.  In our office, by the way, everybody loves such a comparison - and moreover, for all connoisseurs of the animated series, we decided to make a <a href="https://chipndale.solvermate.ru/auth/%3Fone_click%3D32%26signature%3De0ee892a34cf7944286f0b56f728addcdb72f82e">‚Äúspecial demo version‚Äù</a> .  In it, anthropomorphic chipmunks and the team will save those in need with the help of more advanced tools: using phones, computers, the Internet and, of course, our SaaS solution :) <br><br>  As I already wrote - SolverMate is designed for service companies to facilitate their work on servicing users.  I will try to briefly list the main functional advantages: <br>  - absolutely anyone who is more or less computer-wise can work with the program <br>  - you can work with the program from almost any device connected to the Internet from any place and at any time <br>  - the program allows you to set tasks and track their execution <br>  - the program is so smart that it allows you to distribute the load and automatically prioritize <br>  - if necessary, you can integrate the site with the customer base <br><br>  All this together, on the one hand, significantly reduces the operating time of a service company with one client, and on the other hand, it speeds up the solution of user problems (my colleagues even counted - acceleration can be from 20 to 40 percent, here). <br><br>  Well, now the information is more authentic - about what tasks service companies will be able to solve with the help of SolverMate. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Action desk</b> <br><br>  Indeed, the employee‚Äôs desktop, only very active, because it automatically distributes the tasks needed to complete the task, manages the schedule, tracks the execution, redistributes the tasks depending on the load and deadlines, schedules visits - in general, does everything necessary to always in business ... <br><br><img src="http://solvermate.ru/upload/habr/actiondesk.png" alt="Actiondesk"><br><br>  <b>Customer service</b> <br><br>  This is, in fact, a complete customer base of the company.  It can be filled manually.  If the client fills out a call on the support site, then the client base is filled up with its data automatically. <br><br><img src="http://solvermate.ru/upload/habr/client.png" alt="Work with clients in SolverMate"><br><br>  <b>Registration of appeal</b> <br><br>  In the event of a problem or the need to order a new service, the user only needs to go to the site and write a short message or send an e-mail to the support service.  Almost immediately, this appeal will appear on the ActionDesk operator. <br><br><img src="http://solvermate.ru/upload/habr/send.png" alt="Sending calls to SolverMate"><br><br>  <b>Processing incoming requests</b> <br><br>  In general, the message will appear on the desktop though - but this does not mean at all that the operator should drop everything and begin to deal with the newly submitted application.  The program itself will figure out - when he needs to do it.  That is, on the basis of the service level agreement of the ordered service, it will automatically determine the diagnostic period and the term for addressing the request.  And on the employee's ActionDesk, all operations are sorted by decision time - so that each client will receive his share of attention on time. <br><br>  <b>User account</b> <br><br>  Each client has his own personal account - in which he can see how the service company works with his application.  The list of references contains the following information: number, registration time, description, and status of work.  In which case (changed his mind or fixed himself) the user can cancel the appeal or add a comment to it. <br><br><img src="http://solvermate.ru/upload/habr/my_tickets.png" alt="Personal account in SolverMate"><br><br>  <b>Operational management</b> <br><br>  This is the one I like the most.  Because I always have a lot of tasks - and I often miss their deadlines.  Although I write and rewrite my little notes.  And I bring some tasks to the outgluck.  And I make notes in the desktop calendar.  It helps, but rarely.  And SolverMate - this seems to be my case.  Because I will be able to schedule the execution of any task, indicating not only the deadline for the work, but also the deadline before which it is not even worth thinking about this problem.  Especially for some reason, I don‚Äôt want to remember the constant duties that need to be carried out day by day always, they seem so tedious.  But if it is necessary, it means it is necessary, here it is the task that now hangs before my eyes, and even someone is watching me, maybe Big Google? ... <br><br>  <b>Work with information</b> <br><br>  It‚Äôs not necessary to know everything - it‚Äôs enough to know where you can look.  The universal search string allows you to quickly filter lists of documents by system (which values ‚Äã‚Äãare automatically the field values ‚Äã‚Äãof documents) and custom tags.  By the way, tags can be set absolutely for any object. <br><br><img src="http://solvermate.ru/upload/habr/search.png" alt="SolverMate Search"><br><br>  <b>Interactive Reports</b> <br><br>  This is a service, rather, for management, and not for ordinary employees.  If the director is stuck in a traffic jam, he may, for example, have fun by looking at color diagrams showing trends in support service activities (deterioration, improvement of service quality) based on the average number of open and expired calls per day (week, month), number of open and closed hits per day (week, month) over time. <br><br><img src="http://solvermate.ru/upload/habr/business_dynamic.png" alt="Reports in SolverMate"><br><br>  I think that for the first time I told more than enough.  In the next post, I‚Äôll probably dwell in more detail on the existing tariffs - well, or about something else, which you ask me about and what will be more interesting for you than tariffs. <br><br>  Yes - I forgot to say that now all the tariffs are open for free access for 30 days - so you are <a href="http://www.solvermate.ru/%3Fref%3Dhabr">welcome to test</a> .  But I want to warn you that there is one nuance - SolmerMate works with Mozilla Firefox, Safari and Opera, and does not work with Internet Explorer (at least until May).  Perhaps there are other ‚Äúnuances‚Äù in the program - so if you find it, please write to me personally. <br><br>  I say goodbye to this and, as my boss says, let Ctrl-F5 be with you!  True, I don‚Äôt really understand what it means - but from a philological point of view it sounds beautiful;) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88027/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88027/</a></p>
