  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New in the life of the application</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The process of implementing any idea from idea to direct implementation of it is always not as simple as it may seem at first glance.  Any idea has a certain life cycle - the birth, investment in form, development ... At each stage, the idea itself can lose something and acquire something new.  The life cycle of a mobile application, despite all its technicality, is no different from other more spiritual and ephemeral projects.  The world is growing and changing around, and if you want to be successful - change with it. <br><br>  What specifically can influence the decision to change the concept of a mobile application, or even make some adjustments to an existing product? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Undoubtedly, the facts.  In our case, these can be the measurements of key indicators carried out by the marketing service. <br>  For example, take an indicator of the number of active users in an application.  You are actively engaged in the promotion of the finished application, and it seems like there is a certain stable influx of new users, but, for some reason, the number of active users is not growing.  As a result, you cannot gain a critical mass sufficient for self-development of the application further. <br><br>  The question arises: why and what to do?

      Perhaps, an intuitive user interface is not enough - this problem is not the most terrible - a good designer can help in solving it, ready to embody the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa manager.  Perhaps - the user does not understand the main feature of the application.  And here is more difficult - if not hooked - why?  Were the findings of market research correct?  Does the target audience need these functions?  There can be a lot of questions. <br><br>  <b>In this case, you should pay attention to:</b> <br>  <u>1. How well was the marketing research done?</u> <br>  In this case, you should not save and use the services of dubious organizations.  Marketing research is the beginning of beginnings - true and up-to-date information will give you an idea about the market you want to enter, about the product, what it should be.  Building a business idea initially on the wrong foundation, it is impossible to achieve the results that you want to get in the end. <br>  <u>2. Revise the conclusions that were taken on the basis of marketing data.</u> <br>  Information gathering and analytics are different.  Even on the basis of current data, completely wrong conclusions can be drawn.  Do not be lazy, and reconsider everything again. <br>  <u>3. Once again make sure that you are not mistaken with the target audience: gender, age, other social characteristics, interests.</u> <br>  The target audience is, strictly speaking, those who will use your application, and possibly pay for it.  Knowledge of your customer, as well as knowledge of your product - the basic rules for the seller. <br>  <u>4. To analyze the marketing plan, the channels and means used in promotion with the interests and habitat of the target audience.</u> <br>  Do you advertise there?  What form of feed do you use?  It is important to track each placement channel - in the future you will be able to understand which channel is effective and which one is not - specifically for your product.  This will help save both time and money for promotion in the future. <br><br>  So, if everything is correct, and, as a rule, it happens rarely, you can move on.  And look for the reason in the very essence - the main user script.  As an example, I will give the <a href="http://bit.ly/106oCIw">application</a> that we are working on now. <br><br>  The main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe application was to watch the movement of friends on the map online.  The idea itself is interesting.  We determined for ourselves the target audience, its interests and channels of promotion rather quickly. <br>  However, 2 months after the beta launch, we ran into a problem - with a constant influx of ‚Äúfresh blood‚Äù the number of active users does not grow, but remains at the same level. <br><br>  Began to look for the cause.  And this is what we have come to: a new application, but to maintain interest, you need friends - otherwise, who should you watch on the map?  Friends are not tightened into the application as quickly as we would like (we will touch on this topic later).  And here the question arises: what should the user do in the application while he has no friends online?  How can the application be useful to him now? <br><br>  Making a decision on this issue, we came to the conclusion that we need to come up with a new chip that will help keep the user in the application at this stage. <br><br>  <u>For us, the solution to the problem was to provide the user with</u> information about discounts and special offers in the institutions closest to him, as well as informing about upcoming youth activities within a certain radius from the user.  This idea never arose before this, since when creating an application they simply did not take into account the significance of the fact that the user may temporarily have no friends.  Agree, it is difficult to imagine a person without friends.  But!  Everyone has different phones, they all use different applications, and therefore intersection with friends in the same application can be problematic. <br>  By holding the user with information about discounts and special offers, we will achieve the main goal - an increase in the number of active users of the application and gradually reach the critical mass.  When a user has friends, this functionality - information on special offers - fades into the background, giving way to the main user scenario. <br><br>  By making this decision, we did not want to make major adjustments to the concept of the application, and, in our opinion, we managed to do it. <br><br>  The adoption of such decisions depends directly on the project management.  It is quite possible that in our case you would have taken another decision, suggested another idea.  The correctness of a decision, confirm or refute the time, or the results of the same Google Analytics. <br><br>  PS release of the application - in June 2013. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179903/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179903/</a></p>
