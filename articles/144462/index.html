For several months now we have been thinking about how to test our commercial projects?  Travis CI is great for Open Source, but at the moment it does not support closed repositories on Github.  Josh Calderimis on the February toaster promised me that ‚Äúsoon anytime soon‚Äù they would support private repositories, but this has not happened yet.  We even tried to raise our own CI server based on Cruise Control and Intergity, but spat on this case, because  there were some difficulties with setting up, and there was no time to figure it out.  In general, is it necessary to say that I clicked "Answer" without thinking? <br><br>  So, what is this CircleCI?

    <h4>  Interface and Settings </h4><br>  First of all, I logged in via Github and saw something like this interface: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2d5/14f/c6c/2d514fc6cd1c5cbb22745ad89a2dc860.png"><br><br>  At first glance, everything is simple: in the sidebar on the left, in the ‚ÄúAvailable Projects‚Äù section, all projects (including private ones!) That my account has access to are listed.  Putting a check on the project, I can transfer it to ‚ÄúFollowed Projects‚Äù and CircleCI will start tracking it. <br><br>  The project settings interface is very austere, but it allows you to make all the necessary settings.  We, for example, it looks like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/282/c8a/0b1/282c8a0b16633352d145824eff6e172d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9c2/b98/0c1/9c2b980c188f87c3ee2d0181bb886345.png"><br><br>  As promised, the tests began after a couple of mouse clicks.  CircleCI keeps track of all commits to the marked repositories, and as soon as a new commit appears, it launches a build.  As a result of the build, an email is sent to the email.  Tracked branches can not be selected, here‚Äôs how Allen Rohner, one of the service creators, commented on it: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a problem.‚Äù</i>  <i>If we didn‚Äôt have to test the branch</i> <br><br>  In general, it is logical. <br><br>  In the project settings, I also found the opportunity to create a token to use the service API, but for some reason at that moment I could not create a token.  The description says that the API provides full read / write access to the account and you can do whatever you want with it.  A more detailed description of the API is not yet available; perhaps it is not yet planned to be shown to the general public. <br><br><h4>  Cost of </h4><br>  Well, yes, and you thought it all for free?  CircleCI offers a 14-day full-featured trial, as well as various tariff plans: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/424/529/c72/424529c72f92de3f43339e882c3e837c.png"><br><br>  In general, the essence is as follows: from $ 14 per month for each developer (read - an account on Github) for the simplest plan without parallel tests and with a support by email.  More expensive plans differ in the number of parallel tests and the level of the caliper (funny, apparently I managed to grab a plan for $ 14, and then it cost $ 18, which you can see in the screenshot). <br><br>  There is also a plan for those who test ‚Äúfrom time to time,‚Äù where there are no subscribers.  fees, and for each build take $ 1.  I honestly can not imagine how this should work.  Perhaps there builds will need to be initiated manually. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  Separately, I want to mention the level of support that I had guys.  They responded to all my questions asked via the interactive form with lightning speed, within a couple of days made a number of improvements to my request and helped with the project settings: they told me which version to update Selenium, how to make the correct version of ruby ‚Äã‚Äãand the database adapter and etc.  In general, it is clear that the developers are directly interested in their product having success and the most positive impressions remain from its use.  Due to the fact that communication takes place directly with the developers (as long as there are not many customers, probably), everything is very efficient and of high quality. <br><br>  The service is in beta stage, so apparently it is not necessary to judge it very strictly for the time being, but I really like what I see.  Everything is quite simple and at the same time very convenient.  As far as I heard, the UI update is planned in the near future.  For our purposes, the service is 100% suitable and I hope that someone else will find it useful. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/144462/">https://habr.com/ru/post/144462/</a></p>
