Our team is already checking the sound and typing badges.  Our speakers draw their presentations and hone their wording.  And I will talk about how we will contribute to the acquisition of superhuman programmer abilities of our participants. <br><br>  It seems to me that the success of the developer lies in three things: <b>practical professional knowledge</b> , <b>high life energy</b> and <b>continuous education</b> (did everyone notice that to stay in place you have to run?).

      How we managed to include these benefits into the participant‚Äôs basket - read under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You will learn a lot of new things from the world of ASP.NET by listening to reports, talking to speakers and peers.  In other words, immersed in context.  And the concentration of practical professional knowledge precisely in ASP.NET promises to be high. <br><br><h3>  More about reports </h3><br>  ASP.NET platform is on the verge of global change.  <b>Andrey Shelehin</b> (Tinkoff Bank) will tell about them.  Which ones are the most important?  How will they influence the development process?  Should I be afraid and how to prepare?  In the report, you will learn about the new development of technology and the opportunities that will emerge with the release of ASP.NET 5 (vNext) and Visual Studio 2015. <br><br>  In the report ‚ÄúDeployment in ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET vNext‚Äù, <b>Andrei Leskov</b> will tell why Connected consider ASP.NET MVC Dependency Injection as an effective solution for reducing the complexity of business logic.  How it helps to deal with the typical problem of increasing complexity as the development of web projects.  How this solution prevents slowing down the pace of development.  Also from the report you will learn what is new for DI appeared in ASP.NET vNext. <br><br>  <b>Evgeny Agafonov</b> (ABBYY) will talk about how to use Omnisharp, how to put CoreCLR, ASP.NET under * nix.  That is, it will demonstrate the capabilities of cross-platform development on ASP.NET vNEXT. <br><br>  Under the hood of one of the most popular projects in the world - MSN.com - <b>Alexander Belotserkovsky</b> (Microsoft) will drop in.  From the report you will learn about the architecture of MSN.com (what you can share).  Will consider the Azure services that are used in the project.  In particular, why was the cloud document-oriented Microsoft Azure DocumentDB database chosen as one of the data storage elements? <br><br>  About how to develop an online version of a text editor will tell <b>Roman Reshetnikov</b> (DevExpress).  Using the preview version of the new product, the RTF web editor ASPxRichEdit, it will tell you how high responsiveness to user actions was achieved and the performance was maximized.  You will learn how to develop this product, what problems you encountered, and what testing methodologies were used. <br><br>  <b>Artem Kolomeets</b> from Kaspersky Lab will talk about approaches to designing infrastructure for services and services for infrastructure, as well as examples of how to combat the complexity of infrastructure planning.  How these solutions allow you to deal with problems in the deployment of services on the combat environment, the complexity of management, increase safety and reliability. <br><br>  From the ‚ÄúASP.NET Internals‚Äù report by <b>Vitaly Baum</b> (bright box) you will learn how the two main letters mVC - Controller and View work.  How requests find necessary Action.  The life cycle of objects when querying.  What is View, how is the view drawn for the frontend.  How to write your ViewEngine. <br><br><h3>  About prizes </h3><br>  The possibility of continuing education and high life energy is provided by our sponsors. <br>  Each ASP.NET Day participant has a chance to win one of two prizes. <br><br><h4>  <b>Annual plus a subscription to Pluralsight courses worth $ 499</b> </h4><br>  This is <b>one-year</b> access to 11,150 hours of study in 3,700+ programming courses from <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a> . <br>  A ‚ÄúPlus‚Äù means the ability to download code samples, pass tests and receive certificates. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/13d/9a3/34d/13d9a334d89b427f82d87aa8da305cab.jpg"><br><br><br><h4>  <b>Everything you need to experience Ballmer Peak</b> </h4><br>  <b>One box of</b> Queen Mary beer in Burton Ale style from our sponsor <a href="http://victoryartbrew.com/">VICTORY ART BREW</a> will be played. <br>  And now we are negotiating with the venue, so that two kegs of another brand of beer will end up at the afterparty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c43/f75/dcd/c43f75dcdbfb42a19648b090f5133231.jpg"><br><br><br><br>  More than 160 people from 130 companies where development is underway on ASP.NET have already registered. <br>  Hurry up to join colleagues. <br><br>  Please note that a <b>special price</b> is valid until February 22. <br>  <b>Wholesale discounts</b> are valid when purchasing two or more tickets. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.gosharp.ru/ASPNET2015"><b>Sign up now!</b></a>  Free places are getting smaller every day. <br><br>  See you at the conference! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/250773/">https://habr.com/ru/post/250773/</a></p>
