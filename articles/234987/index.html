  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A little creative - calendar with antipatterns</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br><br>  Fasting increased frivolity, for Friday. <br>  I want to tell you about antipatterns that crystallized in our company.  Just For Fun. <br><br>  Every time the developers / installers / circuitry used a repeating email, it was fixed and listed.  When the list grew and almost 12 excuses appeared in it, we had the idea to make our calendar with antipatterns (since excuses illustrate how not to think and do, we equate them to antipatterns).  To do this, we had to master the layout of the calendar and for each anti-pattern "give birth" to the corresponding picture.  Layout was done in LaTex, and the pictures - in inkscape, in svg-format.  In general, it turned out quite open-source'no.  But the post is still no longer about the technical implementation, but about the anti-patterns themselves.  Who cares, welcome. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At first I will describe our anti-patterns, with pictures.  All of them, for the most part, illustrate the misunderstandings between managers and performers.  That is why I zapulnul post in the hub of project management.  I think many will see something familiar.

      I just want to say that the anti-patterns themselves and the pictures for them are just a joke, we did not try to offend anyone. <br><br>  Go! <br><br>  Number one: <b>"The task had a low priority"</b> <br><br>  Otmaza arose when they began to actively implement scrum.  It seemed that no task should be solved if it has a lower priority than those who took on the work for this sprint.  Sometimes it was funny, because  the low priority task was actually important and interfered with higher priority tasks.  At the same time, the project owner was not informed, but at the end of the sprint it turned out like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d70/dde/c81/d70ddec814d94d0192858ddf53d2af20.png"><br><br>  Number two: <b>"we had no tool!"</b> <br><br>  This is a favorite otmaza installers.  Surprisingly, the presence of a blank check for the purchase of virtually any instrument did not solve the problem.  The picture turned out cruel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dc6/f2b/fe3/dc6f2bfe30204115836b5fc632e6dcac.png"><br><br>  Number three: <b>‚Äúthey will say to do - we will do it!‚Äù</b> <br><br>  Here is a man sitting and waiting to be told that this should be done.  Are you sure that this is obvious and you just need to start doing it.  A bit intersects with the antipattern "there was no command to do it."  But it always sounded in that form. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc4/15e/24a/bc415e24adb54a608fa0e7b19cd4e972.png"><br><br>  Number four: <b>"we work</b> . <b>"</b> <br><br>  Terrible phrase, which had been heard from the head of the questions relating to the optimality and rationality of what is happening on his site.  I had to write ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6b9/82a/484/6b982a484b5948939d7a6560eb4abff4.png"><br><br>  Number five (my favorite <b>anti-pattern</b> ): <b>"Everything is ready, but you need to remove it</b> . <b>"</b> <br><br>  Until now, often hear and even sometimes pronounce.  When a bunch of brenches are made from a trunk, and from these bricks a working system is established.  And it seems that everything is ready and at least immediately - in production, but no - you must first remove it.  The comicity of the situation is that putting off is not always such a simple and quick process, followed by testing again, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/645/529/a3b/645529a3bab24a17881a27094e6900e0.png"><br><br>  Number six: <b>"We always did that."</b> <br><br>  We did it crookedly and we will do it crookedly, because we always did that.  How long? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bac/443/e7a/bac443e7a0e34c8dafdfa60ec47557ac.png"><br><br>  Number seven: <b>"It is exactly what was asked for."</b> <br><br>  Some people like to turn off the brain at the time of performing some task.  He is dedicated to this anti-pattern.  And some others think that others think the same way they do.  So it turns out ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d24/c54/ae0/d24c54ae0d9d4ba098369fa8a5950b09.png"><br><br>  Number eight: <b>"There was no command to do this"</b> <br><br>  We recorded it when we saw that our colleagues were ready to sit and waste time, waiting for the command.  It seems to have outlived this.  Now, when the tasks end, they themselves come up and talk about it (although I don‚Äôt remember something, that the tasks have ended recently).  Well, or independently decide that this should be done. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e26/c5f/1f0/e26c5f1f0e5e4bb6b06ffa429b89ad21.png"><br><br>  Number nine: <b>"This needs to be planned."</b> <br><br>  I think many have noticed that there are little things that are easier to do at once than to plan, because they are little things.  And when we are told that these little things need to be planned (yeah, write in backlog, put priority, and go) - we write it down as an anti-pattern.  We did not invent a picture for this anti-pattern.  It turned out this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68b/c0f/7b6/68bc0f7b64004ca6ada951482f604a13.png"><br><br>  Number ten: <b>"It needs to be worked out."</b> <br><br>  Fresh anti-pattern.  We noticed behind ourselves that we often say that ‚Äúthis must be done‚Äù.  So we must take and do, and not talk.  The picture turned out appropriate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a6a/d96/d2c/a6ad96d2c16743ab866eb20e1c11e768.png"><br><br>  Number eleven: <b>"I know nothing - there was no letter"</b> <br><br>  It is used when communicating in real life after a long corporate correspondence.  It is very convenient - it is quite difficult to prove that the letter really was: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ab/93a/0e3/2ab93a0e35dc4ea2ae895a7cae51138d.png"><br><br>  When the pictures were finished, they laid out a calendar in LaTex and released a small edition for distribution within the company and gifts. <br><br>  The source code of the calendar <a href="https://github.com/yapavelkurochkin/cal4fun">is laid out in github</a> .  For a successful build, you will need the Tikz package, since the calendar itself (dates, numbers, etc.) is done with it.  With a little effort from this calendar, you can do any other, you are welcome!  In the same place, in the pdfs catalog there are collected versions - see README. <br><br>  Great weekend to everyone! <br><br>  PS: And what antipatterns are observed in your companies? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/234987/">https://habr.com/ru/post/234987/</a></p>
