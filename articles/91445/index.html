  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Copyright vs culture</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  After reading here different opinions and views on the problem of copyright, I want to suggest a little speculation about this thesis: " <b>Copyright as a factor interfering with the development of culture</b> ." <br><br>  But first, let's still define a little copyright itself.  All articles on this topic occurring in the internet, you can easily shorten to two opposing points of view: <br>  1. I am an author or I earn money on authors, and I demand that everything be banned, closed, taken away, and not let go.  And it is better to plant immediately.  So that was untapped. <br>  2. I am a consumer of the authors, I will use and will use torrents, and if anything, another Emule will take their place and nothing will come of it.  In general, hands off the pirate harbor. <br><br>  At once I want to say, from my point of view, the topic in this section is clearly bloated.  There is a simple conflict of interest which essentially rests on the only factor - cost.  And there is nothing to complicate.  As soon as the conflicting parties come to an agreement on the cost, all this will resolve itself. <br>  I want to talk about the fact that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcopyright is already the fourth is a significant brake on the development of culture, science, and no matter how pathetic it may sound, civilization as a whole.  Starting from the simplest - children in school learn from textbooks.  A textbook is a book, and it has an author.  Do you think that it is more profitable for the publisher to reprint an existing circulation or launch new textbooks?  To which (oh horror), the right may be from another publisher.  Not to mention the fact that a good author‚Äôs textbook, I personally recently bought about genetics, for the money, to put it mildly, not at all student.  I think there are quite a few students who buy one textbook for two or three, because it‚Äôs hard to give one and a half, two or three thousand.  and considering how many textbooks are needed ...

      The existence of "copyright", at least inhibits the spread of cultural objects.  Creations of the authors do not arise from "nothing".  The author is also a person - a carrier of culture, he was born and grew up in society, absorbing the very objects of culture - on songs that fanatel, on films that he adored, on those books that were available to him.  On ideas and scientific concepts that could draw from society.  Would he be able to create his creation if he takes it all away? <br><br>  <b>Any actions aimed at limiting the spread of the works of authors limit the development of culture in general.</b>  <b>Conversely, the more open access to all this, the more likely new creations, new ideas will appear.</b> <br><br>  And this is just the top of the problems that the concept of ‚Äúcopyright‚Äù brings to our lives.  I think it is worthwhile to think about the need to redo the concept as such, and not to talk about torrents.  I want to emphasize that I respect the concept of ownership as such, including the right of the author, to dispose of my work.  It is possible and necessary to think up how the author can receive a decent reward for hard work, but WORTHY, and not use it as an opportunity to shake unlearned money from all.  But now it is not the authors who are mainly engaged in this, but those who are on the alert in time.  I would have nothing against it, you have to be consistent - the market means the market, if it did not affect much more global things.  I do not care in what cultural environment my child will grow when I have one, and the children of my friends. <br><br>  Profit, thirst for money should not stand in the way of the development of science and culture.  In the meantime, only those have real levers of influence on the situation, as it is not ironic who are interested solely in their own advantage. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/91445/">https://habr.com/ru/post/91445/</a></p>
