The Office Portal contains the following new features:

      <br>
    <ul><li>  More modern and intuitive web interface <br></li><li>  Improved wizards to simplify the setup of connecting external systems <br></li><li>  New visual editors DTL (Data Transformation Language) and BPL (Business Process Language) <br></li><li>  New Business Rules Editor <br></li><li>  Ability to use version control systems for Ensemble components being developed and customized in the Management Portal, including BPL business processes, DTL transformations, record resolver mappings, business rules <br></li><li>  Ability to restrict access to user interface components.  A set of predefined roles controls access to Ensemble functions.  Additionally, you can flexibly configure access to the Management Portal by modifying existing user roles or creating your own new roles. <br></li></ul><br>  The new version also allows you to avoid duplication of web pages in different areas, simplifying installation and reducing the time to update versions for systems with a large number of areas. <br>  For more information about changes to the interface and how to use Ensemble in the Management Portal, see the <a href="http://docs.intersystems.com/documentation/ensemble/20121/pdfs/EGMG.pdf">Managing Ensemble</a> document. <br><br><h2>  1.2 Detailed security model in the Management Portal </h2><br>  In this version of Ensemble, additional roles have been added that allow more flexible control over access to the various components of the Management Portal and to the various functions of Ensemble. <br>  If the preset roles do not allow to realize the conceived security model, it is possible to add additional roles or redefine the behavior already existing in order to obtain the necessary level of security. <br>  If you are upgrading Ensemble, see the ‚ÄúNew Security Model for Management Portal‚Äù document for more information on compatibility. <br>  For more information about the security model, see the ‚ÄúControlling Access to Management Portal Functions‚Äù chapter in the <a href="http://docs.intersystems.com/documentation/ensemble/20121/pdfs/EGMG.pdf">Managing Ensemble</a> book. <br><br><h2>  1.3 New implementation of business rules </h2><br>  In the previous release of Ensemble, business rules and routing rules were separated from each other and were XML files. <br>  Both types of rules in the new version are defined as classes inherited from Ens.Rule.Definition, and the sets of rules are described in the XDATA block. <br>  This change will allow working with business rules as well as with other components of products (classes, compilation), including transparently including business rules in the version control system.  In addition, support for nested rules and nested conditions has been added to the XML rule definition.  In addition, the graphic editor of rules has been completely reworked, which added support for these features. <br><br><h2>  1.4 Version Control for the Management Portal </h2><br>  The hooks of the version control system, which until now have only been built into the Studio, have been added to the hooks from the Management Portal.  Thus, in this version, for Ensemble components that are customizable using visual editors in the Management Portal, it is now possible to connect a version control system. <br>  For more information, see the ‚ÄúConfigure Source Control Settings‚Äù section of <a href="http://docs.intersystems.com/documentation/ensemble/20121/pdfs/ECONFIG.pdf">Configuring Ensemble Productions</a> . <br><br><h2>  1.5 Record Mapper (Recorder) </h2><br>  A very common method of data exchange in information systems is files of records of a certain structure, which contain either fixed-length fields or delimited fields, as well as nested fields. <br>  The new Ensemble tool, the Record Mapper, allows you to describe the structures of file records and to create components for reading and modifying such files. <br>  Record Mapper automatically creates stored classes, the set of properties of which reflects the structure of file records specified by the user in a convenient graphical interface. <br>  Pre-installed business services are read from such files, and business operations allow you to write to them in a format defined by the developer. <br>  See also the <a href="http://docs.intersystems.com/documentation/ensemble/20121/pdfs/ERECMAP.pdf">Using the Ensemble Record Mapper</a> document. <br><br><h2>  1.6 Record packet processing </h2><br>  The Record Batch Handling mechanism associated with the Record Mapper allows you to manage the processing of file records.  Due to this functionality, batch output of records to one or several files is possible depending on various conditions, for example, taking into account the time of receipt of records.  See also the ‚ÄúBatch Processing and Handling‚Äù section in <a href="http://docs.intersystems.com/documentation/ensemble/20121/pdfs/ERECMAP.pdf">Using the Ensemble Record Mapper</a> . <br><br><h2>  1.7 XML Virtual Documents </h2><br>  Prior to this release, Ensemble had two ways to handle XML documents: <br>  1. Mapping the XML document to the corresponding Ensemble objects, which can then be processed using the DTL transformation mechanism.  This is a powerful and convenient XML processing tool, but not very effective for large documents with a complex structure, in which only a small part of the fields are processed. <br>  2. Processing XML as a stream using XPATH or XSLT to read and modify the document.  This is a powerful approach, but technically complex and requires the presence of certain skills of the programmer. <br>  The new version has a third processing option - virtual XML documents.  With this approach, Ensemble allows you to work with XML documents as streams, but at the same time use the DTL editor and routing rules.  This is a simpler way than working with XPATH or XSLT, and less expensive than mapping XML to objects. <br>  For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.intersystems.com/documentation/ensemble/20121/pdfs/EXML.pdf">Ensemble XML Virtual Document Development Guide</a> . <br><br><h2>  1.8 Notifications (alerts) of performance monitoring </h2><br>  In addition to the existing types of notifications in the new version of Ensemble, you can set the performance parameters of queue processing and message processing time for the system.  If the queue becomes too long, or the messages are processed for a very long time, the system will be able to send alerts to administrators.  For more information, see the chapter ‚ÄúSetting, Processing, and Monitoring Alerts‚Äù in the <a href="http://docs.intersystems.com/documentation/ensemble/20121/pdfs/EMONITOR.pdf">Monitoring Ensemble Productions</a> documentation section. <br><br><h2>  1.9 UDDI API support </h2><br>  The Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI) specifications define a registration service for web services and for other electronic and non-electronic services.  In this release, Ensemble comes with the EnsLib.UDDI package to use the UDDI register API.  For more details, see the EnsLib.UDDI.Base entry in the Class Reference. <br><br><h2>  1.10 Cach√© 2012.1 Features </h2><br>  Ensemble 2012.1 runs on the Cach√© 2012.1 kernel.  Accordingly, the release of Ensemble 2012.1 also includes all the changes that came with the version of Cach√© 2012.1. <br><br><h1>  Other improvements </h1><br><h2>  2.1 DeepSee Panels </h2><br>  The new Ensemble monitoring dashboards are implemented using DeepSee Zen components.  The appearance of the panels has improved, new possibilities for Ensemble data visualization have appeared.  For more, see the Adding Business Metrics to Dashboards section in the ‚Äú <a href="http://docs.intersystems.com/documentation/ensemble/20121/pdfs/EDAS.pdf">Using Dashboards in Ensemble</a> ‚Äù section. <br><br><h2>  2.2 ebXML Messaging </h2><br>  Ensemble extends ebXML support.  In particular, additional message patterns have been implemented to support interaction with the English National Health Service (English National Health Service). <br><br><h2>  2.3 Sequence Manager (HL7 Sequence Manager) </h2><br>  HL7 Sequence Manager now allows more than one sequence in production.  For more, see the ‚ÄúHL7 Sequence Manager‚Äù section in the ‚ÄúElements of a Routing Production‚Äù chapter in the <a href="http://docs.intersystems.com/documentation/ensemble/20121/pdfs/EDH7.pdf">Ensemble HL7 Version 2 Development Guide</a> . <br><br><h2>  2.4 Creating a project in the Studio, containing all the modules used in the Products </h2><br>  The ability to create a project in the Studio of products helps when exporting / importing products from one system to another.  This new functionality allows you to automatically include in the draft scheme HL7, as well as the various classes referenced by the elements of the Products.  See also the ‚ÄúUsing Studio in Ensemble‚Äù section of the <a href="http://docs.intersystems.com/documentation/ensemble/20121/pdfs/EGDV.pdf">Developing Ensemble Productions</a> documentation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/139837/">https://habr.com/ru/post/139837/</a></p>
