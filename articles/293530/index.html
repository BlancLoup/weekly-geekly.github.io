To get rid of it, you put all your strength into exploring what the next step should be and who you need to make an impression on. <br>  But if you only think about increasing the amount of work ahead and the number of people you need to make happy, you can doom yourself to failure or burnout in advance ... or even to both options at once.  To succeed after promotion, you need to go beyond the usual strategies, and do something unusual.

      Here are three unexpected truths that significantly increase the chances of success and continued career growth. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">1. You need to determine what you will no longer do</font> </h2><br>  This is elementary arithmetic.  The more time you give to one area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity, the less it remains to others.  So, in addition to defining the <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/dostigayte-bolshego-sokrashchaya-chislo-obyazatelstv/">terms of reference</a> for a new place, you need to figure out what you will not do anymore.  This can lead to a reduction in the number of projects for which you are responsible: the creation of reports, models or proposals will turn into a simple observation of them.  Accepting the transfer of some direct responsibilities to another manager.  And the appearance of an assistant will allow you to respond to fewer emails. <br><br>  Finding out what you will not do is very important for the following reasons: <br><br>  1. This will help determine when it is worth shifting tasks to others, rather than performing them yourself. <br>  2. This will give your subordinates the opportunity to take responsibility for their own work. <br>  3. It will force you to seriously engage in new things. <br><br>  At first, you will cope with unfamiliar tasks worse than duties in a previous position.  If you do not become discouraged and hold on to the familiar territory of the old place and master the necessary skills, you can really improve the level of professionalism. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">2. You should be more dependent on other people.</font> </h2><br>  Yes, you have been promoted through your skills, hard work and potential.  Tempting (especially if you are still not sure that you will increase) may seem like a huge amount of work.  After all, I want to show the leadership: you are able to do everything yourself (and with high quality!). <br><br>  The only problem is that with each boost, your dependence on others will increase, not weaken.  Therefore, you should take care of creating a team in the office that can perform part of your duties.  Such a redistribution will allow you to do a higher level of strategic and managerial work. <br><br>  Also need support outside the office.  It's about hiring a janitor, nanny, cook, or someone else who performs routine tasks.  This will enhance the ability to recover when you are out of work.  This also includes the search for mentors or trainers who can help in improving <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/chislo-rabochikh-chasov-v-nedelyu-dlya-naibolshey-produktivnosti-35/">managerial</a> skills, ranging from <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/chislo-rabochikh-chasov-v-nedelyu-dlya-naibolshey-produktivnosti-35/">managing time</a> to creating interpersonal relationships and everything that is between these two disciplines. <br><br>  You have never done the work that you are now.  Therefore, lack of confidence in their actions is the norm.  However, you will never succeed if you do not master the skills necessary for prosperity at this level. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">3. You must maintain your internal priorities.</font> </h2><br>  The higher you rise in an organization, the greater the importance of the base.  You need to sleep no less, and more - and be stricter to yourself, to make it a priority.  <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/zdorovyy-son-4-soveta-ot-kosmonavtov/">Neglect of sleep</a> significantly reduces your abilities: control over emotions, decision-making and productivity.  You cannot afford to donate this to the next level. <br>  You need to exercise more, not less - or just make a stable schedule of physical training, if you are already in good shape.  Regular activity will improve health, improve mood and energy levels. <br><br>  It is necessary to give family, friends and just rest more time, and not to give up such moments.  This will give strength to withstand the stresses associated with the ups and downs in the business, and create the feeling that life is not only work. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/splochennost-komandy-uspekh-ili-porazhenie/">‚ÄúTeam cohesion: success or failure?‚Äù</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293530/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293530/</a></p>
