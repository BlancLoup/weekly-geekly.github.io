      Went by chance with a child in the library to play.  I saw the poster before, but since I have an Oculus Rift at home, I was not at all interested.  Well, what can they surprise me? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First, a few words about the Danish libraries.  Libraries have long ceased to be a place where they take to read books.  I would say that now it is not even its main purpose.  Mostly people come there to use the Internet, print, copy.  In addition to books, you can take CDs with music, movies (but not the newest), console games (for 2 weeks, give a maximum), and board games. <br><br>  There is a children's corner, with books and toys for the smallest and with modern consoles, for the older.  This is how it looks like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9c7/fad/39b/9c7fad39b12d73b625bca7a031bffb19.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Xbox one</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a27/ad4/e97/a27ad4e97bb59fd80e2bb95e519008ee.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>PS4</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a16/1b6/a74/a161b6a74cac25a087d06f74e7814977.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Wii U <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/36a/69d/1a2/36a69d1a2a8d590843c6a5639e689b38.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>iPad and Nintendo DS</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd3/341/6d3/fd33416d3d4f0ad6970d91ba0719b375.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>For some reason apart, Xbox360 with Minecraft always on</i> <br><br>  In short, with the times. <br><br>  Here you go.  I go, it means, with the baby in the library, and here I am met here is such a machine: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad0/fe9/f56/ad0fe9f56c2417056fdf31a3b2b82684.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  But it is, flowers.  A few more steps, and my jaw dropped.  Here they are berries: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5eb/5a2/b21/5eb5a2b215b882c16aeb8019e4f30153.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Coolest Spectrum with a built-in tape recorder.  I've never seen anything like this. When I read the word Kempston Joystick, I almost shed a tear. <br>  UPD: wise <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/quester/" class="user_link">Quester</a> tells you that the Amstrad CPC is no Spectrum, but its partially compatible counterpart, released at the same time, as a direct competitor.  On the same Z80, with the same games, but there is no direct compatibility. <br>  Go ahead: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ca/61a/676/0ca61a676806ccfb287f53ac05ef72dd.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Commodore 64. Live it was not possible to meet.  As I understand it, the post-Soviet space was of little distribution, unlike the Spectrum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/249/1ff/ca0/2491ffca0f974fdbc4f1efd1ebc74908.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nintendo Entertaiment System.  Dandy.  I also saw the original one for the first time.  In my childhood, not far from home, they opened a rolled 8-cue ball.  It was quite expensive - I did not often manage to beg for rent money, and only for great services in school and at home.  When, nevertheless, this happy day came, I, naturally, did not close my eyes all 24 hours of rent. <br>  A middle-aged uncle was sitting at the box office and playing games, and around the day, children were crowded all day long - they watched him play.  Part - at the counter, part - on the street by the window.  From there it was completely difficult to see, but it did not stop anyone.  All working day could stand.  From life was! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3ca/e18/18a/3cae1818a3a55fee5279207d8b30feb2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And the last hero is Sega Mega Drive.  16-bit.  A dream ... As far as she seemed unattainable abrupt ... She was not at the box office.  She was only one of my classmate.  Once I tried to get him for money to give me a rental for two days, when his parents left somewhere.  To school, of course, did not go.  He had a "Dune"!  Ordos, Harkoneny ... True, there was no memory card, so it was impossible to save.  Remember this amazing joystick control?  Soldiers are allocated only one at a time ... and the minimap cannot be used.  Selected - and drove to scroll to the other end of the field.  Then - next.  Repeat until victory.  In general, I passed it. <br>  Now, when I think about it - it's terrible, unhappy children.  Parents were allowed to play some time before bedtime.  You put this dune and shparish.  And here - ‚ÄúTen o'clock!  Turn off and sleep! ‚Äù.  Ahhh!  And turn it off to start all over again the next day.  And since there were only a couple of cartridges with games - replayability was - oh-she-she!  Only when the ancestors left somewhere, could the toy be passed to the end. <br><br>  So, something I digress.  In the library, the kids were interested and played with pleasure in all these unprecedented echoes of such a distant, for them, era.  After all, the oldest thing these children could play was the Xbox360 and the computers on Prescott.  Modern consoles were empty, and kids were crowded around the old ones.  Nice damn it!  Especially popular was the Dandy with a pistol and shooting ducks.  Probably everyone reading these lines knows what it is. <br><br>  Oh yes.  There was also the Oculus Rift, for which there was no queue either.  All at once tried and everything.  In the end, more adults are having fun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b7f/5f3/d29/b7f5f3d29ab249c63f588ecee2441114.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There were still board games, but few played in them: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a0d/aad/98c/a0daad98caf6e0e7d5418e437cb1538b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d1/973/fb7/0d1973fb799abf617c7e6c117e657f2e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f35/252/701/f3525270168d168b1bc6b3ee228860b2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <s>After the event, there was a locker from which you can rent old consoles.</s>  No, this locker is standing there all the time, and, apparently, stood somewhere in the far corner before.  I asked, they just did not throw out the prefixes from the old times, and they give up until they break. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5d9/36f/a99/5d936fa997252ddce1138c8f22415417.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  That's all.  In my opinion, a great promotion.  It is doubly remarkable that it is not carried out by private enthusiasts, but by organizations supported by the state (although, of course, most likely, enthusiasts simply pushed the idea where they should).  I would like this to be possible not only in socialist Denmark, but also in capitalist Russia :) <br><br>  Thanks for attention. <br><br>  Until! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363581/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363581/</a></p>
