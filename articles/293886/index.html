Online store on Joomla 3 with 1C: Enterprise integration</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Before making an important decision, buy an online store and start your business on the Internet, I suggest that you start to stop.  Think carefully.  And weigh all the financial indicators. <br><br>  According to the specifics of my work, (and I work as a 1C specialist in the implementation of 1C configurations: Trade Management, 1C: Manufacturing Enterprise Management 1.3, 1C: Small Firm Management, 1C: ERP Enterprise Management 2.0), and having a lot of experience in implementing 1C configurations on trading and industrial enterprises, I know 1C: Enterprise well with all its consequences. <br><br>  In this article I want to make a comparison of the cost and help aspiring businessmen to reduce their future costs several times, and also get a lot more than they initially offer us in the market.

      <br>
      I conducted an audit and considered what costs are required to open an online store on a well-known platform. <br>  1C-Bitrix. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why 1C-Bitrix?  Because it is the only system where site integration with 1C is supported right out of the box. <br>  Honestly, this amount is very surprising.  Consider the cost of an online store on the principle: CMS + website template + 1C: Trade Management 11.1 + 1C integration with CMS. <br>  Site content, hosting, template styling, etc.  We will not evaluate, because  This is additional work and you can either do it yourself, or hire people, or not do it at your discretion. <br><br>  We consider. <br><br>  Costs for 1C-Bitrix: <br><br>  1) Initially, you will need to buy 1C-Bitrix edition.  The most suitable and economical option - <a href="https://www.1c-bitrix.ru/buy/cms.php">1C-Bitrix: Small Business</a> <br>  The editors included 31 module.  Basic online store.  Cost: 28 952 rubles. <br>  Description: <br>  ‚ÄúOpen your online store at minimal cost.  Place any quantity of goods in the catalog, manage discounts and delivery.  Integrate the store with 1C and Yandex.Market. ‚Äù <br><br>  2) A good template online store on Bitrix: from 9000 to 19900 rubles.  Example: <a href="http://marketplace.1c-bitrix.ru/solutions/dw.electro/">marketplace.1c-bitrix.ru/solutions/dw.electro</a> <br><br>  3) The main delivery <a href="http://armexbs.ru/price1/">1C: Trade Management 11.1</a> - 17400 rubles + two client licenses 6300 x 2 = 12600 rubles.  Why two?  In the main delivery 1 license + 2 is additionally purchased.  We get one license for the manager, the second for the manager, and the third for the warehouse or accounting, at your discretion.  If anything, you can always buy more. <br><br>  3) To be honest, I am not familiar with the details in 1C-Bitrix, but some offices (which I found on the Internet) offer assistance in setting up 1C and 1C-Bitrix synchronization.  This joy costs from 36 000 rubles.  and includes: <br><br>  1. Audit of 1C-Bitrix and 1C platforms regarding the possibility of typical integration out of the box.  4 500 rub. <br>  2. Setting up integration with 1C using standard exchange mechanisms from the 1C side and the site, setting up parameters for importing and exporting items.  7 500 rub. <br>  3. Setting up integration with 1C from the site, setting parameters for importing and exporting orders.  Setup of integration on the side of 1C.  7 500 rub. <br>  4. Configure real-time data exchange.  4 500 rub. <br>  5. Consultation of a 1C specialist on technical issues related to integration settings and the public part of the catalog during the operation of the solution (after completion of work on the stage (s) of paid integration).  Minimum package - 3 hours.  4 500 rub <br><br>  I forgot to clarify: we are considering only licensed software.  Other options are not provided, and I do not advise you to eliminate unnecessary problems with copyright law. <br><br>  Total: 114,852 rubles. <br>  Space money!  And this is still without content site and without hosting. <br><br>  And now we consider the alternative. <br>  Oddly enough, as an alternative, I will take the world famous <a href="http://www.joomla.org/3/ru/">CMS Joomla</a> . <br>  For the work of the online store on CMS Joomla we use the free online store module " <a href="http://virtuemart.net/download">VirtueMart</a> ". <br>  As characteristics of the online store, I have taken the CMS Joomla 3.x + module VirtueMart 3 + module integration of the site on Joomla with 1C. <br><br>  As a module for integrating Joomla with 1C, the modern IT services market offers many options.  Most of them are based on the fact that some additional code is embedded in the ‚Äú1C: Trade Management 11.1‚Äù configuration, which, according to the developers, does not affect the overall configuration work, and you get a good exchange with the site in return. <br>  As a 1C specialist, I can tell you that with this ‚Äúembedding‚Äù the code into the configuration, there is a so-called ‚Äúwithdrawal from support‚Äù process, about which all 1C-nicknames like to talk. <br>  "The configuration is removed from support" - this means that the next update of the 1C program you will definitely encounter problems, errors, and other head hemorrhages.  Do you need it? <br><br>  I do not, and therefore I will take the module easier, which is built into the root of the site and works on the principle of a standard script: <a href="http://site-with-1c.ru/index.php/forum/dobro-pozhalovat/1-vyshel-novyj-modul-integratsii-joomla-3-x-c-1c">Joomla 3 and 1C integration module</a> <br>  The cost of this module is about 5,000 rubles.  The developer upon purchase offers support and updating of this module. <br><br>  So, we consider: <br><br>  1) CMS Joomla 3.x for the work of an online store - 0 rubles, because  This CMS is freely available and distributed free of charge. <br>  2) VirtueMart 3 module for e-commerce automation - 0 rub. <br>  3) <a href="http://joomla-zone.ru/shablony-virtuemart/shablon-jz-shop-10-jphoneshop">Template</a> online store for VirtueMart 3 - from 1900 rubles.  up to 5,000 rubles <br>  4) The main delivery of <a href="http://armexbs.ru/price1/">1C: Trade Management 11.1</a> - 17400 rubles + two client licenses 6300 x 2 = 12600 rubles. <br>  5) The integration module Joomla 3 and 1C - 5 000 rubles.  Setup according to the instructions.  No extra costs. <br><br>  Total: 36,900 rubles. <br>  Savings: 114,852 - 36,900 = 77,952 rubles.  Or 3.5 times cheaper! <br><br>  At the same time, the joint work of the online store on Joomla 3 with 1C: Trade Management 11.1 is similar to the work in 1C-Bitrix: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c7d/22a/a8e/c7d22aa8ea5a46f98e59059e67b56085.png"><br><br>  In addition, for CMS Joomla, there are many additional modules and plug-ins (both paid and free) that will extend the functionality of your site to not modest heights.  At the same time, free hosting is also suitable for CMS Joomla. <br>  And in 1C-Bitrix, everything is much more expensive. <br><br>  Conclusion: For any business, the most important and important thing is the quickest return on investment in a short time.  On the software, you can significantly save money during the initial opening of a business, while significantly reducing costs and obtaining the necessary functionality to complete the work of the company. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293886/</a></p>
