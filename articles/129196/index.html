Today I would again like to talk about inter-tasking interaction, but only about one specific mechanism - Persistent Publish / Subscribe (PPS, sustainable publishing / subscribing service).  Just want to note, this is a new kind of interaction in QNX Neutrino, which appeared only in version 6.5.0.  The PPS technology is not implemented in the microkernel, and a special manager with a speaker called <code>pps</code> is responsible for the operation of this mechanism. <br><br>  PPS has proven so reliable, convenient and easy to use that it is used in new solutions and products, such as, for example, <a href="http://www.qnx.com/products/reference-design/freescale-reference-design.html">Smart Energy</a> , QNX Car and even a <a href="http://www.kpda.ru/BSP/PlayBook">BlackBerry PlayBook</a> tablet. <br><br>  In this article we will get acquainted with PPS in practice, it will be told about the features of the technology, and at the very end it will be shown that PPS is a real cosmopolitan among the mechanisms of inter-task interaction, and many programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãsupport it out of the box. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  What is PPS for? </h4><br>  Using PPS allows you to simplify the construction of systems consisting of many components.  In the future, these components can be modified, supplemented and even deleted without altering the entire system as a whole and without changing other components.  Different development teams that develop applications using different technologies and programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãcan develop components that will interact with each other without any knowledge of each other. <br><br>  The main advantages of PSS over other methods of inter-task interaction: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Weak binding</b> - allows you to easily change the set of interacting components. </li><li>  <b>Greater flexibility</b> - the interaction can be built not only according to the classical one-to-one scheme, but also one-to-many and many-to-one. </li><li>  <b>Saving data between reboots</b> - no need to worry about saving the current data, just place them in the PPS object and the <code>pps</code> manager will do everything for you. </li><li>  <b>Language independence</b> - many languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms already support PPS, and if necessary, you can add this support.  Components implemented in different programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãcan easily interact with each other. </li></ul><br>  Most likely, if the system already consists of three or four components, and in the future it can be changed and expanded, the use of PPS will be the right step. <br><br><h4>  What is PPS? </h4><br>  PPS is pretty simple.  These are files in which objects with their properties are displayed.  They are not even displayed, but they live right there.  Only one object is stored in one file.  Any process can read and write such a file, if the POSIX access attributes allow it.  You can work with PPS from the program in almost any language, since  to access objects, use the usual functions <code>read()</code> , <code>write()</code> , etc.  Probably enough tediousness and, perhaps, it's time to start practical exercises. <br><br>  The first step is to start the <a href="http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.5.0/index.jsp%3Ftopic%3D/com.qnx.doc.neutrino_utilities/p/pps.html"><code>pps</code></a> manager: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># pps</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  The manager, of course, has command line arguments, but for us there is nothing of principle.  Anyone can read the description in the reference manual.  When performing all the following exercises, we will assume that the <code>pps</code> manager is already running.  Now let's try to create some object, for example, <i>figure</i> : <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># touch /fs/pps/figure</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  It's all.  Now the object can be read: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># cat /fs/pps/figure @figure</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  So you can see the name of the object.  The object has no properties yet.  You can add them, for example, <i>form</i> : <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># echo "form::square" &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/figure # cat /fs/pps/figure @figure form::square</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  You can add another property, for example, <i>color</i> : <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># echo "color::red" &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/figure # cat /fs/pps/figure @figure color::red form::square</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Be careful, the following command will delete the object and create it again with one property: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># echo "color::green" &gt; /fs/pps/figure # cat /fs/pps/figure @figure color::green</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Hope you know the difference between&gt; and &gt;&gt;.  Any property or several properties of an object can be changed or added at any time: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># echo "color::blue\nform::circle" &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/figure # cat /fs/pps/figure @figure color::blue form::circle</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Any property of an object can be deleted: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># echo "-color" &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/figure # cat /fs/pps/figure @figure form::circle</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  If the object itself is no longer needed, then it can be deleted: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># rm /fs/pps/figure # cat /fs/pps/figure /fs/pps/figure: No such file or directory</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  I think that Habr's readers are literate enough people to understand the meaning of the examples and rewrite them in their favorite language. <br><br>  And now, it seems to me, it's time to explain the meaning of the name PPS - Persistent Publish / Subscribe. <br><br><h4>  Persistent </h4><br>  Service PPS during operation stores data in RAM.  But at the same time, PPS ensures that data is stored between reboots in non-volatile storage.  Typically, data is stored in the file system on disk or flash-memory.  If necessary, the developer can organize the preservation of data on non-standard media. <br><br>  At startup, the <code>pps</code> manager recovers data from non-volatile storage.  You can specify various data recovery modes using the <code>-l</code> option: <br><br><ul><li>  Download the names of objects and directories on request; </li><li>  immediately load the names of directories and objects, but load the contents of the objects upon request; </li><li>  download all when you start the manager. </li></ul><br><h4>  Publishing </h4><br>  We already know enough about this <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129196/"><sup>1</sup></a> .  You just need to open the file to write and write and delete the attributes of the object: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs pgsql">sprintf( ppsobj, "-color\n" ); // <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">Delete</span></span> the "color" <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">attribute</span></span> <span class="hljs-keyword"><span class="hljs-keyword">write</span></span>( ppsobj-fd, ppsobj, strlen( ppsobj ) );</code> </pre> <br>  It is probably worth noting that several processes can simultaneously open the same object for writing and change attributes.  This can be useful if different processes are responsible for different attributes. <br><br><h4>  Subscribing </h4><br>  On the subscription, we also already know something, but not all.  You do not think that PPS is so simple and trivial.  Yes, there was a dog somewhere.  And she rummaged in the subscription.  There are subtleties of a subscription, such as, for example, blocking reading and delta mode.  Consider some of these features. <br><br><h5>  Blocking read </h5><br>  By default, reading from a PPS object file is non-blocking.  This is common behavior for other file systems.  It is made specifically for standard utilities to behave as usual.  The easiest way (but not always the best) is to get object changes in a timely manner, this is a blocking read.  To open a PPS object in the blocking read mode, just open the file with the qualifier <b>? Wait</b> . <br><br>  Let's conduct a bold experiment and in one console we will change the properties of the object, and in the other we will follow these changes.  To do this, you need two consoles.  If the Photon graphical environment is running, then everything is simple.  If the work goes on in the text console, then switching between them is carried out using the key combination Ctrl + Alt + n (here n is the key with the number 1, 2, etc., and not the F1, F2 function key as in Linux, for example).  And so, we create an object: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># echo "color::green" &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/figure</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  And in the second console, open it in blocking read mode: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># cat /fs/pps/figure?wait @figure color::green</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Note that the <code>cat</code> utility does not terminate, but is blocked by reading.  Now in the first console, type a couple of commands: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># echo color::red &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/figure # echo color::white &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/figure</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  In the second console, the output continues: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">@figure color::red @figure color::white</code> </pre> <br>  Especially clearly do all this in Photon, when two consoles before his eyes.  You can exit <code>cat</code> usual Ctrl + C. <br><br>  You can switch the reading mode on the fly.  The following C code illustrates this feature: <br><br><pre> <code class="hljs lisp">flags = fcntl( <span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-name">fd</span></span>, F_GETFL )<span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">; flags |= O_NONBLOCK; fcntl( fd, F_SETFL, flags );</span></span></code> </pre> <br><h5>  Notification of new data </h5><br>  There are two ways to get new data from PPS in a timely manner: <br><br><ul><li>  Open an object in blocking read mode. </li><li>  Use the QNX notification mechanism <code>io_notify()</code> or the <code>select()</code> function based on it POSIX. </li></ul><br>  Using the <code>select()</code> function is preferable because  allows you to change the properties of several objects. <br><br><h5>  Subscription Modes </h5><br>  There are two subscription modes: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>full</b> , when the subscriber reads all the properties of the object when the object is modified;  and </li><li>  <b>‚ÄúDelta‚Äù</b> , when only the properties of an object that have changed since the last reading are read. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d7f/e67/d2a/d7fe67d2a57b4793a8d42949e1dd0631.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>1. Full and "delta" PPS subscription modes.</i> <br><br>  It should be noted that in full mode the object is always read in its entirety with all its properties that exist at the time of reading the object.  This means that if between readings the same property was changed several times, then the last change will be read. <br><br>  In the ‚Äúdelta‚Äù mode, on the contrary, the subscriber receives all changes in the properties of the object, i.e.  Nothing will be missed <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129196/"><sup>2</sup></a> .  To open an object in delta mode, you must specify the qualifier <b>? Delta</b> after the object name. <br><br>  The following example shows the reading of an object in delta mode.  On the first console, create an object: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># echo "color::red\nform::square" &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/figure</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  On the second console, subscribe to it in delta mode: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># cat /fs/pps/figure?delta,wait @figure color::red form::square</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  Change the color: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># echo "color::green" &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/figure</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  We observe changes: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">@figure color::green</code> </pre> <br>  Change the shape: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># echo "form::circle" &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/figure</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  We observe changes: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">@figure form::circle</code> </pre> <br>  We change two properties at once: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># echo "color::red\nform::square" &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/figure</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  And we get one change: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">@figure color::red form::square</code> </pre> <br><h4>  Server mode </h4><br>  The PPS object may have a server, i.e.  such a process that is paramount among publishers.  It is also called a critical subscriber.  To open an object in server mode, you must specify the <b>? Server</b> qualifier.  The remaining subscribers become clients. <br><br>  If any of the clients changes the property of the object, only the server will receive the notification and change of the object.  The client identifier (number) is also added to the object identifier, for example: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">@figure.1234</code> </pre> <br>  If a new client subscribes to an object, the server receives a notification with a plus sign (+): <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">+@figure.1234</code> </pre> <br>  A similar notification arrives if the client unsubscribes from the object, only with a minus sign (-).  If the server wants to respond only to the client, then it must record the object with the client identifier, otherwise all clients will receive a notification.  In fig.  Figure 2 shows the interaction between the PPS server and client. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/677/ac5/c65/677ac5c65feb9789ba79e0dfe7b5d8bf.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>2. PPS server mode.</i> <br><br>  It is difficult to show an example of server operation using only command line utilities, so, in case of interest, it is proposed to develop it yourself, for example, in C. <br><br><h4>  PPS support in various programming languages </h4><br>  The main programming language in QNX is C. But other languages ‚Äã‚Äãand platforms are supported.  Will they support PPS?  Yes, they will.  For a strategic platform like Adobe Flash, there are extensions and classes for working with PPS.  And what about other languages? <br><br>  As it was possible to be convinced from everything that was told in this note, for interaction through PPS it is enough only to be able to open files, read from and write to them.  For comfortable work, you will need an implementation of the <code>select()</code> function.  That's probably all the requirements.  And these requirements are met, for example, by Python.  Do not believe?  Yes, there is nothing easier, let's boldly create two PPS objects using the following commands: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment"># echo "form::triangle\ncolor::green" &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/figure # echo verb::runs &gt;&gt; /fs/pps/action</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  In another console, run the following Python script: <br><br><pre> <code class="python hljs"><span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">#!/usr/qnx650/host/qnx6/x86/usr/bin/python import select action = { "verb" : "stop" } figure = { "form" : "circle", "color" : "black" } sentence = { "action" : action, "figure" : figure } f1 = open('/fs/pps/figure?delta', 'r') f2 = open('/fs/pps/action?delta', 'r') while 1: r, w, e = select.select( [f1, f2], [], [] ) for f in r: d = f.read().split() for a in d[1:]: k, v = a.split( "::" ) sentence[ d[0][1:] ][k] = v print figure["color"], figure["form"], action["verb"]</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  In the first console, we will try to change the different attributes of the <i>figure</i> and <i>action</i> objects, and in the second we will observe a change in the output.  Try to play yourself, you should get something like the following output: <br><br><pre> <code class="bash hljs">green triangle runs green circle runs blue circle runs white square runs white square stops</code> </pre> <br>  The Python script is quite simple and serves only to illustrate the possibilities of working with various programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãwith PPS.  There is no so-called anti-fool.  But pay attention to how simple the program is.  Wow, you don‚Äôt have to do anything special to interact with each other.  Personally, I really liked the PPS technology. <br><br><h4>  Additional materials </h4><br><ol><li>  <a href="http://www.kpda.ru/QNX6/PPS">PPS technology</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.kpda.ru/Publications/PPS">Sustainable QNX Publish / Subscribe Service</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.qnx.com/developers/docs/6.5.0/index.jsp%3Ftopic%3D/com.qnx.doc.neutrino_pps/about.html">QNX Persistent Publish / Subscribe Developer's Guide</a> </li></ol><br><hr> <i><a name="ref1"></a></i>  <i><sup>1</sup> It is worth noting the server mode, which is considered separately.</i> <br><br> <i><a name="ref2"></a></i>  <i><sup>2</sup> In the event of a restart of the operating system, changes accumulated in the delta mode will be lost.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129196/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129196/</a></p>
