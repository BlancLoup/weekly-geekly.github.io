  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Happy Birthday, Habr ‚ù§</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr!  I know you for a long time - since 2008, when I, then still never an IT specialist, opened you up for some crazy link.  Do you know how it was?  Opened, did not understand, closed.  Then you began to fall more and more often, I looked at it, read it, a year later I went to the IT sphere and ... a spark, a storm, madness.  Today I want to confess my love to you and tell about our friendship :-) <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/794/f3f/982/794f3f9826b8e122d9f4273c1f81eb83.png"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  How I met your Habr </h2><br>  I worked as an analyst in a telecom company (a nickname - from there) and one of my functions was interaction with programmers: I wrote and carried them the TOR to create complex reports and even individual working applications for the commercial department.  The dialogue was hard and was usually supported by a kilogram of gingerbread, cakes and chocolates, because I looked dumb with an economic education, and the programmers did not drink beer. <br><br>  I read books on development and analysis, parsed code fragments (I was interested in SQL) in order to at least somehow speak with developers in the same language.  At that time, IT was not yet such a rapidly growing trend, and there was no immersion on Wednesday.  Then I started reading Habr - first completely, then on the selected hubs and tags (yes, I was the one who reads the tags).  And spun.  I went to study in a two-year school of software development and, although I did not become a programmer, I understood the topic from the bottom, I defended my thesis with my real program and became equal with these creepy ASUs.  So equal that he became the holder of the most complex ERP implementation by the sales department in terms of sales.  It was a tense, wild year, but I managed to do it - largely because, thanks to Habra, I plunged into the depths of many issues, learned to read the comments, skimmed what plurality of opinions was in IT (oh!).

      It is July 29, 2011.  My friend could not get an invite, could not cope with it and the head of the development department.  Their articles were rejected one by one.  I said: "I bet, will I get an invite?" And sat down at my first <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/125360/">article on technical tasks</a> .  On August 1, 2011, a UFO extended its beam to me and took me aboard its plate - Habr.  It is a pity that the dispute was of interest, could get a box of chocolates. <br><br>  In general, for the most part I read Habr, sometimes I tried to write news with some kind of analytics, all attempts were successful.  I became a testing engineer, I mastered many valuable skills again by the usual method - according to articles from Habr.  It was cool, but money is better than money - and I returned to commerce.  It is time to learn Habr from the other side. <br><br><h2>  Habr corporate </h2><br>  I wrote to the blogs of several companies as an author (including the blog of the one where I worked).  I will not go into the details of what and how - this is not particularly interesting, there are many of these.  I better tell you what the shock and awe Habr causes in most companies :-) <br><br>  First of all - Habr effective.  If you try properly, you can solve any problem: from collecting leads for sales to building a personal brand manager and finding the best employees from the entire industry (well, or just suitable).  But this is a thorny path that can only be followed by paving one‚Äôs own rut.  If you copy someone or behave the same way as in other venues, it will be a fiasco, bros. <br><br>  Yes, Habr is scary.  Especially if you poke in the water, not knowing the ford. <br><br><ul><li>  If you lie - you will certainly be exposed and this will be an indelible shame.  I can not be sure, but I think there are companies that, in principle, are shaken or, on the contrary, have grown because of Habr. <br></li><li>  If you do not know the topic you are writing about, but you want to enter the trend, it will be painful. <br></li><li>  If your blog is about advertising and press releases without any valuable or useful information, get ready: you will be shipped the minuses. <br></li><li>  If you are not ready for an adequate response to criticism in the comments, to a weighted dialogue with the most terrible trolls - you will drown even the best material in the world. <br></li><li>  If you do not understand what your audience is - pass by or try to learn and learn, the benefit of Habr himself gives the opportunity for this.  Nothing is a mystery, analyze, read, watch videos and understand. <br></li></ul><br>  Observance of these simple rules guarantees a stable plus under the corporate posts of your company (and it‚Äôs easier to live with them, these are just signs of general adequacy).  Moreover, almost any company can find its audience and write cool.  Fortunately, there are enough examples. <br><br><h2>  The most valuable in Habr√© is users </h2><br>  But everything would be wrong if it were not for your people, Habr.  Trolls and helpers, the smartest and ‚Äúmost intelligent‚Äù, the grammar of the Nazis, techno-Nazis, nerds and ironic sinuses, top-class specialists and beginners, bosses and subordinates, PR people and HRs, legends and novices from the Sandbox. <br>  ‚ÄúHabr, in fact, is the most real self-regulating community that copies our behavior in reality,‚Äù - this is how I would like to continue my text, but it is not.  I know the real users of Habr who are silent and introverts in life, and on Habr√© have a couple of thousand comments, I know just wonderful and intelligent guys who are behaving on Habr ... er ... a little bit disorderly.  And this is good - because many of us may be a bit different on Habr√©, write about topics that can not be talked about, discuss with those who can not meet in life.  Habr is a small life :-) <br><br><h2>  I love Habr for ... </h2><br>  ... fruitful discussions and interesting comments. <br><br>  ... informative and versatile, for a different level of information on all IT issues. <br><br>  ... those blogs of companies that give cool information for which you do not need to pay: read without limits, apply, take ideas. <br><br>  ... hard discussions in which you hone the skills of dialogue and the ability to use sarcasm, but not mate and insults. <br><br>  ... constant and dynamic development, for dialogue with users - have many such Internet projects passed its ten-year milestone?  And Habr and 20-year-old will pass. <br><br>  ... his team, which we know little and rarely see, but it invisibly always with us and makes Habr steeper and more modern. <br><br>  ... all his logic, uniqueness and openness. <br><br>  Habr, I wish you not to be that, but to change with the times, keep your best endeavors, be different and cozy, diverse and united. <br><br><h3>  Habr, I love you! </h3></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/453522/">https://habr.com/ru/post/453522/</a></p>
