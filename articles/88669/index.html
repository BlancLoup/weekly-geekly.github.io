Due to some reasons, I faced the need to find a good program for ‚Äúrestricting‚Äù children from ‚Äúbad‚Äù sites. <br>  In this topic, I would not like to talk about the need to control children on the Internet - <u>this</u> is <u>what each parent decides for himself</u> .  I would like to help those who nevertheless decided to attract specialized software to help.  For when searching for the necessary program, I spent a lot of time, and the solution was on the surface. <br><br><img src="http://www.bg.ru/pix/article/238/8257/deti_1.jpg"><br>  <i><sup>Photo taken from the expanses of the "Internet".</sup></i>  <i><sup>() photos: Sergey Leontiev</sup></i> <br><br>  I am interested in asking for Habrakat ... <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      So, as I wrote above: it became necessary to find a program of the so-called ‚ÄúParental Control‚Äù, ‚ÄúInternet Filter‚Äù.  One of the conditions was: ‚Äúfree program‚Äù.  The deadline for finding the necessary software was small.  It should be noted that everything is not as simple as it seems at first glance. <br><br>  If you score in Yandex-Google-Bing, etc.  request ‚ÄúParental Control‚Äù (well, or similar), then 90 chances out of 100 that you stumble upon a good overview of these programs two years ago on the popular site ixbt: <a href="http://www.ixbt.com/soft/parentalcontrol.shtml">Utilities for parental control of sites visited by children</a> . <br>  The article is not bad, but this is not what we needed.  Let's briefly explain why: <br><br>  <strong>Crawler Parental Control</strong> - no longer exists, its development has ceased and links to downloads have been removed. <br>  <strong>KidsControl</strong> is a good program, but the price is 870 rubles.  If you put on a home computer, it may fit.  Yes, and the last update of the program was oh how long ago. <br>  <strong>ParentalControl Bar</strong> is also an ‚Äúold man‚Äù, already forgotten by the developers.  IE8 - kills through time.  Yes, and nothing prevents to run another browser.  The default black and white list is missing. <br>  <strong>Spector Pro</strong> - in contrast to the above - is not abandoned.  But the price of $ 99.95 repels. <br>  <strong>CyberMama</strong> is an abandoned project.  Yes, and can not filter sites. <br><br>  The computer was already groaning from the control programs installed on it.  And already preparing to sleep, I stumbled upon one of the forums on the <strong>Internet Censor program</strong> . <br>  Having visited their website, the thought arose: ‚Äúand how much does it cost ?!‚Äù.  But immediately I saw: ‚Äúdistributed for free.‚Äù  Already not bad. <br>  I looked at the main features on the site - they satisfy the request.  The primary list of "good" sites is, you can add your own.  There are opportunities to switch the "rigidity" of control.  Updates.  Simple interface, etc. <br>  Went to the license agreement - meets the requirement.  You can set as you like, and anywhere. <br>  I decided to test it. <br>  The result pleased more than. <br>  Initially there is an excellent verified list of trusted sites.  Test polazil on the Internet - even somehow not very much felt the presence of the program.  But when trying to ‚Äúget to where it is not necessary‚Äù, or ‚Äúto jump out what is not necessary‚Äù - the program gladly reported in a beautiful form: ‚Äúaa-yay‚Äù. <br><br>  It is strange that the link to this program never jumped out to the ‚Äúpopular‚Äù requests for parental control. <br>  Let's go now to the program itself. <br>  It is located on the official website of <a href="http://icensor.ru/">Internet Censor</a> .  It is worth noting that the site looks quite nice eye. <br>  The site contains instructions both in Video Format and in pictures.  Will be able to put any housewife. <br>  After installation, we are greeted by the welcome screen of the program, asking to enter a password (it starts up during installation): <br><img src="http://icensor.ru/soft/help/3_pass_enter.JPG"><br><br>  After entering, we will be greeted by a quite friendly and intuitive interface: <br><br><img src="http://icensor.ru/soft/help/3_ui.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://icensor.ru/soft/help/4_upload.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://icensor.ru/soft/help/4_options.JPG"><br><br><img src="http://icensor.ru/soft/help/4_proxy.JPG"><br><br>  In general - lyapota.  All the necessary settings that may be needed - are available. <br><br>  Now let's see how friends with antivirus, in the list of "friendship": <br><br><blockquote>  The line of current products Kaspersky <br>  Outpost Security Suite Pro <br>  Symantec endpoint <br>  Esed NOD32 Smart Security 4 <br>  Dr.  Web Security Space <br>  Free avast!  4 Home Edition <br>  BitDefender Total Security 2009 <br>  PC Tools Internet Security 2009 <br>  Mcafee internet security <br>  Panda Global Protection <br>  Trend Micro Internet Security Pro <br>  AVAGA FireWall <br>  ZONEALARM Internet Security <br>  Kerio Personal FireWall </blockquote><br><br>  Which is very good. <br><br>  In general, the program can be described for a long time.  If there is a need, then you can read and download it here: <strong><a href="http://icensor.ru/">Internet Censor</a></strong> <br><br>  <b>The most interesting</b> <br>  The program is absolutely free.  Developers - domestic.  Updated well.  It has an alert for mail, etc.  The site is pleasant to the eye.  Help system - at the level.  There is even a recommendation to use this program from the Public Chamber of the Russian Federation.  But about her very little information on the Internet.  Most links to commercial products, often with a lack of Russian language. <br><br>  <b>Afterword</b> <br>  I will not say that this is "not advertising."  Hurry even she herself.  Only completely free and based on the usual enthusiasm. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/88669/">https://habr.com/ru/post/88669/</a></p>
