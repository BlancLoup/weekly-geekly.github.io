  <section class="page js-page"><h1>YaC 2014: Yandex's main technology conference for those who really need it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, I am Bobuk, and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/194276/">traditionally</a> on Habr√© I tell about YaC.  Only three days left before the end of <a href="https://yandex.ru/yac2014/registration/%3F_openstat%3Dc2l0ZTtjYW1wYWlnbmhhYnI7cmVnaXN0cmF0aW9uO2hhYnI">registration</a> at <a href="https://yandex.ru/yac2014/%3F_openstat%3Dc2l0ZTtjYW1wYWlnbmhhYnI7bWFpbjtoYWJy">Yet another Conference 2014</a> .  Perhaps you remember that last year it became the biggest conference about hardcore technology in Europe.  But this time we decided to do everything even more seriously.  Hardcore and technology will remain, and they will even become more, but the people we call will be selected much more strictly (and they will be less). <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/239663/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ba5/e76/9a0/ba5e769a02af46168e18285714d561e8.jpg"></a> <br>  We have previously tried not to miss any marketing bulshit from IT companies and now we are trying even more in this regard.  YaC is a place where you can come and get new knowledge, and most importantly, share what you have gained over the past year.  And it always worked very well.  But the conference still got a lot of people who came just like that.  For example, sometimes SEOs, which we overlooked, broke through, very young guys, students.  The latter always really want to learn something new, but so far they can not give anything in return.  Therefore, this year we decided to approach the selection of participants much stricter. <br><br>  We have three mechanisms by which people this year fall on YaC.  At first, we manually selected and invited people familiar to us, who are known for certain that they are terribly interesting and can be of great benefit to everyone at the conference.  Now we have reached the second stage, when it is possible, as before, to fill in the questionnaire and submit an application.  After registration closes on October 10 at 11:59 pm, people who can share new knowledge will be algorithmically selected from your questionnaires.  And, yes, if you did not fill out the questionnaire, but only filed an application, then with very high probability you will not get anywhere.

      If you are a person from the list below, this does not mean that you will definitely be interested in YaC: <br><a name="habracut"></a><ul><li>  <b>Seoshnik</b> .  This conference is not even about searching, but about technology. </li><li>  <b>Webmaster</b> .  This is not an event about the creation of sites. </li><li>  <b>Journalist or blogger broad profile</b> .  It makes no sense to come to people who write about life in the city or fashion trends.  And even beauty bloggers, despite the fact that they have recently been called Apple.  If you write about technologies and understand that you will help your readers navigate the conference reports, understand what will be of interest to them, then watch the broadcast or come, having previously accredited the <a href="">press service</a> .  By registering through the standard form, you can not pass our selection algorithms - they are focused on specialists. </li><li>  <b>Specialist incomprehensible profile</b> .  Here is a typical PHP programmer - this is a super-wide profile programmer, that is, not an expert in anything.  I‚Äôll clarify now that this is a typical programmer, because there are normal PHP programmers.  They are simply very few. </li><li>  <b>Recruiter and HR employee</b> .  We never called them. </li><li>  <b>Employee Yandex</b> .  With them we followed exactly the same principle as with external people.  We have a very tough restriction for our colleagues who can go to the conference this year.  If in the past years we tried not to limit them, then this year they are the same conference participants as everyone else.  They also need to fill out a questionnaire to prove that they will benefit the conference itself, and not just themselves. </li></ul><br>  People who are not prepared, who poorly imagine the world of modern technologies, simply have nothing to do on YaC.  Speaking directly, there is everything for programmers.  And mathematicians.  At the same time, I sincerely believe that the system administrators to whom one of the visiting schemes is dedicated are programmers like everyone else.  These are people with a technical cast of mind, who often program, but just not many people admit this.  So system administrators are no different from programmers globally.  Unless they have a lot of interesting knowledge in specific areas. <br><br>  Previously, the conferences had such a ridiculous problem: the same person wanted to go simultaneously to several sections that went in parallel.  We have now developed an intellectual scheme for visiting YaC, which allows a person to work out a route through the conference.  Roughly speaking, we know which reports are most interesting for system administrators and people with a similar mindset.  And the program for them includes some reports related to programming more than if they were sections only about administration.  This is not just a separate room, it is a route, written as a schedule, according to which you can move between different rooms and always stay on the reports you are interested in. <br><br>  We have developed <a href="https://yandex.ru/yac2014/program/%3F_openstat%3Dc2l0ZTtjYW1wYWlnbmhhYnI7cHJvZ3JhbTtoYWJy">six such schemes</a> and want to set up an experiment.  In general, we are just trying to make the conference as technological as possible.  For example, in past years, they refused to hand over paper trinkets and other handouts, because this is a completely useless thing that accumulates among people in the garbage disposal. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d8e/c66/b31/d8ec66b314914321b10ece0c2cdf2191.jpg"><br><br>  We understand that people from other cities will find it very difficult to get to YaC.  We tried to facilitate this task by personally inviting people who we have known for a long time and whom we really want to see at the conference.  Unfortunately, since we want to choose the coolest audience, we will, in fact, send invitations at the last moment - a few days before the event itself.  This greatly complicates the arrival of people from other cities - especially from Vladivostok, but now it‚Äôs cheap to hand over the ticket, and you can buy it in advance.  If you want to come from another city, you need to take a special approach to filling out the questionnaire.  If you have filled out an application, but at the same time know about yourself that you are not a very technical specialist, then you most likely did it in vain.  There are probably no such people on YaC.  At least, we will do everything on our part so that they do not get to the conference. <br><br>  If you understand why you go to YaC, and realize that the participation of the conference will benefit both you and other participants, <a href="https://yandex.ru/yac2014/registration/%3F_openstat%3Dc2l0ZTtjYW1wYWlnbmhhYnI7cmVnaXN0cmF0aW9uO2hhYnI">register and fill out a questionnaire</a> .  If you do not receive an invitation, but consider that we have underestimated your motivation, then you will have another chance to get to YaC - after we decide on the guest list, you can buy some very small part of the tickets.  This is the third selection mechanism.  We believe that it will also be useful - the person who buys the ticket, realizes why he does it and what he will receive from it.  And all the money raised from the sale will go to educational projects for schoolchildren. <br><br>  We stopped aiming at the maximum of the audience and decided that it was much more interesting to call only supercontext participants to the site itself, and invite everyone else to watch the broadcast.  She will go live.  Moreover, its viewers will see a part of the material that will not be on the court.  We tried to do something like a mini-channel for the time of YaC: with live interviews, with the presentation of reports, with everything that we like so much.  In addition, you can <a href="https://yandex.ru/yac2014/on-air/">subscribe to the notification</a> of the start of the broadcast.  We hope that participation in the conference at home or at work at our own computer will not be the same as before.  Frankly, most modern conferences either post the video heavily after they are held, which is very unpleasant.  Either it has funny problems with broadcasting when it is not working or is in Chinese, which is also not very clear, because many of our people in the country still do not speak Chinese well. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/239663/">https://habr.com/ru/post/239663/</a></p>
