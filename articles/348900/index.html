In today's compilation there are 4 startups that can change the global healthcare industry as early as 2018. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  <a href="http://www.geneticimmunity.com/">Genetic Immunity</a> </h2><br>  The American biotech company Genetic Immunity is developing and commercializing a new class of therapeutic vaccines (‚Äúimmune therapies‚Äù) for the treatment of chronic diseases like HIV, human papillomavirus, as well as cancer and various types of allergies.  The purpose of vaccines is to strengthen the human immunity, making it more resistant to incurable diseases and reduce the destructive effect, if the disease does occur.

      The company's main product, DermaVir vaccine, has passed a series of rounds of clinical trials that confirmed the fact that it can kill HIV-infected cells.  At the moment, the company is preparing an ICO to finance work on obtaining the necessary licenses and approval of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the introduction of vaccines on the market. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.mediledger.com/">MediLedger Project</a> </h2><br>  Launched by LinkLab and Chronicled, the MediLedger project states that its main goal is to unite the efforts of drug manufacturers, retailers and wholesalers to create a tool that simplifies the distribution of prescription drugs and makes the process transparent. <br><br>  The project works in accordance with US regulations (in particular, the Drug Supply Chain Security Act, DSCSA).  The project team uses the blockchain to build an electronic system to search for and further control the distribution of drugs that are sold only by prescription.  It is planned that the largest pharmaceutical companies, as well as organizations at different stages of the drug supply chain and medical institutions, will become nodes of the system. <br><br>  Throughout 2017, project participants worked out the conditions for participation in it, which could satisfy various market players.  Now that this work is complete, 2018 should be a period of active development. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://www.simplyvitalhealth.com/">SimplyVital Health</a> </h2><br>  The team launched in February 2017, the project SimplyVital Health creates its own electronic audit trail ConnectingCare.  This system combines data from medical organizations.  As a result, doctors can get access to information stored in the blockchain of patients who, for example, simultaneously visit different doctors in different clinics (for example, an oculist in one, a dentist in another). <br><br>  Smart algorithms of the system generate recommendations for more efficient use of the capabilities of different clinics, so that the treatment of the patient becomes more convenient, while maintaining the benefits of medical organizations.  Within the system, clinics receive rewards for working together and achieving positive results. <br><br>  In addition, the project team is developing its own Ethereum fork called Health Nexus, a ‚Äúsharpened‚Äù protocol for the needs of the healthcare industry. <br><br><h2>  <a href="https://robomed.io/">Robomed network</a> </h2><br>  The Robomed Network project is a decentralized medical network designed to improve the effectiveness of patient care.  Patients and hospitals are united in a single system through a smart contract, which prescribes the treatment paths and the desired results.  Thus, the patient here pays only for the result of his treatment, and not for the medical process itself - as it has always been in the field of insurance and paid medicine. <br><br>  According <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-healthcare-2017s-successes/">to</a> Coindesk, approximately 9,000 patients are connected to the Robomed network, 30,500 medical organizations providing services for a total of $ 2 million. <br><br>  And what interesting medical startups do you know? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/348900/">https://habr.com/ru/post/348900/</a></p>
