      In this connection, the financially-planned side of the psto business in the vending business. <br><br>  Who needs it - welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Counting money </h4><br>  As expected, the main thing in drawing up a vending business plan, like any other business, is taking into account future imminent costs and expected incomes.  The income from each of the vending machines consists of the following key parameters: <br><ul><li>  Cost of service for the consumer </li><li>  Cost of service for the operator </li><li>  Number of service users per day </li><li>  The number of days in the month when the device is available </li><li>  for users (for example, in the case of installation of the machine in a place where visitors are not daily - in business centers, through passage enterprises, etc.). </li></ul><br>  Costs <br><ul><li>  Rental price (fixed amount or percentage of income). </li><li>  Electricity costs (per month) </li><li>  Taxes (default is income tax (STS). </li></ul><br><h4>  Profitability in the examples <br></h4><br>  <b>Soda machine</b> <br><br>  The average cost of the machine fits into the price range from 100 to 150 thousand rubles.  Calculations show a fairly quick payback of the devices - from five months. <br><br>  Specific figures for autonomously working gas-water gun with 19-liter tanks will look as follows: <br>  So, the initial cost: <br><ul><li>  the purchase of an automatic machine - 150,000 rubles (the average cost of such an automatic machine is from 100 to 150,000 rubles) </li></ul><br>  Monthly expenses: <br><ul><li>  rent (including electricity costs) - 5,000 rubles; </li><li>  transportation costs - 1,500; </li><li>  UTII - 1,500; </li><li>  refilling of CO2 cylinder - 300; </li><li>  machine maintenance - 1,000 rubles. </li></ul><br>  The cost of the product is as follows: 200 ml of soda without syrup cost us (rounded) at 1 ruble, with syrup - 3 rubles, with double - 5 rubles, a plastic cup costs 1 ruble (for a detailed calculation, see <a href="http://veq.ru/catalog/equipment-analitika/doc/746/">here</a> ).  If you set the price for 5, 10 and 15 rubles, respectively, for a glass of drink, then you get a profit: 3 rubles from a glass of water without syrup, 6 and 9 rubles - with single and double syrup.  Selling 100 glasses a day without syrup, 100 with syrup and 50 with double, we get 1350 rubles of profit or 40,500 rubles a month. <br><br>  250 servings of drink per day is a mid-annual rate;  while in the summer, small queues of thirsty people constantly gathered around soda machines, which gives an average figure of 1 cup per minute on a hot day or ~ 600 servings per day, then in the winter under the roof of a store you should not count on its former popularity.  So, 250 sold servings daily minus the monthly overheads give us - 31,200 rubles of net profit per month remains, which ‚Äúdiscourages‚Äù the value of the gas-water machine for those same 5 months. <br><br>  And I think it is not necessary to explain that some sums from the example can be significantly adjusted by life circumstances and local authorities. <br><br>  Other examples of calculations - on the example of a <a href="http://kopirkin.ru/calculator.html">copy machine</a> , a <a href="http://bahilkin.ru/content/view/41/54/">boot selling machine</a> , a <a href="http://pit-start.ru/content/view/20/34/">car self-service</a> automatic machine, you can look at the links - despite the fact that this is the manufacturer's website, there are quite convenient cost calculators that nobody forbids using for their own selfish purposes;) <br><br><h4>  The main point </h4><br>  How can you significantly influence the magic of numbers in your business plan?  By and large, there is only one way - and this is the main law of the vending business: a thoughtful choice of location.  Two key factors for a successful choice are the search for synergy and concern for convenience for consumers. <br><br><h5>  Synergy </h5><br>  Some types of machines may be an additional service in relation to the installation site. <br><br>  For example, <a href="http://www.autosberkassa.ru/">Avtosberkassa</a> provides instant payment services with the receipt of a bank receipt - this service will be useful in almost all state institutions or universities, or the <a href="http://pit-start.ru/">Pit-Start</a> mentioned above, a self-service for tire inflation, filling windshield fluid and cleaning the vehicle interior - for gas stations in a competitive place can be an advantage. <br><br>  According to the experience of some operators, it is possible to even agree on the free placement of such machines, because  they will also attract customers or serve as an additional factor in their retention for your landlord.  Perhaps it does not mean necessarily, but a thoughtful choice of the place to install the machine is a key moment of the success of the entire business. <br><br><h5>  Convenience </h5><br>  Take the machines, designed to meet the needs of hurrying people, for example - for the sale of printed publications.  Pay attention to where the devices are installed in the Moscow metro?  Not always in sight, and meet the buyer last - when the newspaper, most likely, already purchased.  You will not put them on the aisle either, since it will be inconvenient for the buyer to make a purchase.  On the other hand, this problem has been solved by automatic machines for instant payments - they really stand at every turn and this does not prevent their active use.  Therefore, in the case of a point that will stand in the way of hurrying people, it is necessary to think carefully about the location of the vending machine for selling newspapers. <br><br>  Another factor is shyness or secrecy.  You will never see a condom vending machine on the street or just hanging in public in a public place - for the same reason that this kind of vending generally exists and develops successfully: people sometimes hesitate to buy condoms - even in pharmacies, not to mention , to do it in plain sight.  In this case, a large cross point for the machine - rather evil. <br><br><h4>  And instead of an afterword </h4><br>  This post is the fourth and the last in a series of introductory materials on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/tag/%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%2520%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%2520andorro/">vending them.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/tag/%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B3%2520%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%2520andorro/">Andorro</a> . <br><br>  Actually, we conducted the familiarization work among the habraneselena - and we did it quite successfully: for three posts - 300 comments, 230 pluses in karma, approval from habrayusers is priceless;) Thank you for being with us, and I hope I managed to burden your memory amount of amusing and possibly even useful information. <br><br>  Good luck to everyone and plus in karma!  :-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/77592/">https://habr.com/ru/post/77592/</a></p>
