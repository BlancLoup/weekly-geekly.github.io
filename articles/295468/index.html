How to get there?</i></b>  <b><i>Search shows airplanes only as far as Mexico City.</i></b>  <b><i>Before SJD I can not even find a transplant (AWAD).</i></b>  <b><i>Next flight of a local company?</i></b>  <b><i>What are the difficulties, risks, schedule, cost, pr?</i></b> <br><br>  The search is worth airport Los Cabos / San Jose Cabo / SJD.  This is an international airport that accepts not only American, but also European and Russian flights.  On the 28th of August I flew from Moscow to Mexico City and then the ticket cost me 49,000 RUR, and Los Cabos was 52,000 RUR by IBERIA.  If you wish, you can fly to Mexico City and for $ 60 fly to SJD by local airline Volaris - flies every 4 hours.  I did so, I had plans in Mexico City) There are no difficulties and risks, everything works like in the USA.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b5/78c/699/3b578c6997e94fe99a14d0507eba57f5.jpg"><br>  I recommend the search engine airline ticket Trip.ru. <br><br>  Be sure to specify ¬± 3 days when specifying dates in the search - this is how you will find the best price, as it may not turn out to be cheaper on the fixed dates of the tickets! <br><br>  For example, on <a href="https://www.trip.ru/flights/searches/27f1eb7cc97c4484b98a3cb1cbb2ca09">this</a> search for November 16 - December 16, you can buy a KLM airline ticket round-trip, Moscow-San Jose Cabo-Moscow for 70,335 rubles. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f16/74a/06b/f1674a06be6046dc96cb79bbc80b7847.png"><br><br>  <a href="https://www.trip.ru/flights/searches/27f1eb7cc97c4484b98a3cb1cbb2ca09">www.trip.ru/flights/searches/27f1eb7cc97c4484b98a3cb1cbb2ca09</a> <br><br>  <b><i>2. Judging by the map, the house is located outside the city.</i></b>  <b><i>Around the desert.</i></b>  <b><i>So for everything you need to go to the city?</i></b>  <b><i>Supermarket, restaurant, gym, school, etc. So?</i></b>  <b><i>What's next, what's not?</i></b> <br><br>  Google maps have not updated their photos from the satellite of this area for a long time.  Around the same freshly built cottage villages, like ours.  We walk to Costco (the Russian equivalent - METRO) on foot for large purchases and to OXXO for beer and ice cream.  It is 15 minutes on foot on the sidewalk.  Gym, dance studio, restaurants there. <br>  On the next street (after three houses) there is a university ‚ÄúUniversidad de Tijuana‚Äù - there is also a high school there. <br>  The city center is exactly 10 minutes by bus, a little earlier - Walmart with many other shops, banks and a food court.  The bus is modern, runs every 15 minutes.  I prefer to go to the store MEGA - it is like the Russian ‚ÄúAlphabet of Taste‚Äù. <br><br>  Location of the most popular shops in Cabo San Lucas.  Distances are small.  CaboHub walk to Holiday Inn Fitness Club in 14 minutes. <br><br>  Places: <br><br>  Costco is a wholesale supermarket in the style of METRO CASH &amp; CARRY.  There is a food court and free parking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b69/274/fb5/b69274fb5166427fb3029ae4f609c844.jpg"><br><br>  Holiday Inn Fitness Club - fitness club.  There is a dance studio, Banorte Bank, a restaurant, a bar, a Blockbuster multimedia store, and free parking.  Separately, it is worth noting the presence of OXXO - a small store where you can buy little things, pay for a phone or other services. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/632/3c4/b68/6323c4b68cc3402e9c28fb4d3f2feb20.jpg"><br><br>  The University of Tijuana - here is only a department of the university itself, where there are undergraduate programs, courses, college and high school.  Learn in English and Spanish.  These are our neighbors across the street. <br>  Refueling.  There is a pharmacy and a store with buns, beer and cigarettes. <br>  Walmart is a very large store in the style of GIPPO / CROSSROADS.  There is a HSBC bank, a VIPS restaurant, a pet shop, an electronics store and a dozen others.  Free parking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/786/e6d/649/786e6d64935943a9914ebbfdb92caf46.jpg"><br><br>  Chedraui is a very large supermarket for the home.  10% cheaper than Walmart and they are very proud of it - even exhibiting prices from Walmart alongside their prices.  There are banks Bancomer and Banorte.  Free parking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6a5/e1c/39f/6a5e1c39fa5146dc88b4ee04f1e81773.jpg"><br><br>  Mega is a large and very high-quality supermarket.  In terms of purity and quality of products - ‚Ññ1, better than Russian.  I prefer to buy there, let it continue.  For 15 minutes more on the way, in my opinion, there is no role here.  Free parking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b13/750/67b/b1375067b51b4deda6e2bf9beaf14f25.jpg"><br><br>  Soriana is a huge shopping complex in the style of Russian Mega.  There is a grocery supermarket, Coppel - a supermarket for the house with furniture and household appliances, popular clothing stores, restaurants, food court.  Free parking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ca/969/e87/0ca969e87980493eb23e2b1ad59e9162.jpg"><br><br>  Cinepolis - cinema and other entertainment.  Movies are in English and Spanish, you need to choose on a schedule.  Located in the same Soriana.  Free parking. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/68b/0cd/8b8/68b0cd8b862c46f385169dc91af4159f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a36/4a4/4fb/a364a44fb0014833aad1e43f65bf4cad.png"><br><br>  <b><i>3. What about transport?</i></b>  <b><i>I understand there without a car in any way?</i></b>  <b><i>I think you have to go 2-3 times a week to the city?</i></b>  <b><i>How much is a rental car for a month?</i></b> <br><br>  Travel around the city and near the city costs $ 0.8.  In another city - San Jose or Todos Santos - $ 2.  Airport - $ 5.  The house is 7 minutes walk to the bus stop.  Without a car is quite possible - I live without a car. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b43/765/914/b437659140784921b733da64c54d7ac5.jpg"><br><br>  Chevolet Aveo rental costs $ 35 per day. <br>  We will have a car!  We buy a jeep for our hub.  With a jeep this question disappears by itself. <br><br>  <b><i>4. Is there any difficulty with buying a local sim card?</i></b>  <b><i>what tariffs?</i></b> <br><br>  Buy a local SIM-card is not a question - a passport and a prepayment of $ 7.  The connection here is prepaid, as in Russia and Belarus.  Calls to the US are the same as calls to Mexico, there is no roaming between the states of Mexico.  A minute of conversation costs $ 0.12;  SMS is $ 0.06.  3G / LTE Internet Limited - you need to buy packages: from 10 MB for $ 0.3 to 2 GB for $ 25.  Starbucks / McDonalds / Burger King type cafes always have free WiFi. <br><br>  Tariffs for cellular communication can be found <a href="http://telcel.com/portal/personas/amigo/detalles/recarga_amigo.html%3Fmid%3D1114">here</a> .  Prices in pesos (MXN), which are also denoted by the dollar symbol $.  Divide by 16 to get the price in dollars. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/078/0b3/16f/0780b316fb074747b9ec66411cd8ff12.png"><br><br>  <b><i>5. Language.</i></b>  <b><i>How hard is it to communicate without knowing Spanish?</i></b>  <b><i>Is there a language school nearby to learn Spanish?</i></b> <b><br></b> <br>  Most locals speak English, or understand the language.  Not fluent english, but you can communicate.  For 1.5 months here I had language difficulties only with gas tankers in the house - they did not speak English at all. <br>  There are 3 Spanish language schools: <br>  Spanish in Cabo - <a href="http://www.spanishincabo.com/">www.spanishincabo.com</a> <br>  Columbus School - <a href="http://www.columbus-school.com/">www.columbus-school.com</a> <br>  Sham Rock - <a href="http://www.shamrock-school.blogspot.com/">www.shamrock-school.blogspot.com</a> <br>  At Tijuana University, I was recommended the last one - Sham Rock.  I haven't checked it yet, I don't know. <br>  We also have Minerva Ballesteros - she can be your Spanish tutor! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f8a/3ea/f98/f8a3eaf98be5402ea7ec235e989004dd.jpg"><br><br>  Follow the development of the project on the pages of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/CaboHub-startup-hub-in-Mexico/591656730981771">Facebook</a> , <a href="http://vk.com/public99860882">VK</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/CaboHub_com">Twitter</a> , <a href="http://ru.cabohub.com/">website</a> and write your thoughts and suggestions in the comments, or to our mail <a href="">cabohub.com@gmail.com</a> <br><br>  Life is too short to spend on a gray city far from the center of world innovation.  Let's create the abode of the future together! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295468/</a></p>
