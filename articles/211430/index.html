The ambulance uses OSM programs and they need address information in the village of Krasnokholm and the two nearest villages.  They sent address plans of the village and villages, and after some correspondence even permission from the administration to integrate address plans into the OSM. <br><blockquote>  Quote: "To the head of OpenStreetMap, Moscow" </blockquote><br>  On the evening of January 22, the information was <a href="http://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php%3Fpid%3D393309">posted</a> on the OSM forum.

But the mappers did not stop there.  The ‚Äúshock wave‚Äù of enthusiasm in the vicinity of the village and the villages clarified the roads, contours of the forest and rivers, sheds, single trees, land use areas, power lines, etc. <br><br>  On the 23rd evening, I could not find what else to draw in the village.  I drew only a couple of tracks to the north. <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúStunned, for the first time in my life I wanted to take part in a sofa cartopat, and it turned out that they had already eaten the whole cake :(‚Äù literan </blockquote><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThe day before yesterday was emptiness, today is already a garden city‚Äù Zverik </blockquote>  On the second day, the drawing was polished to a shine. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f95/1cc/580/f951cc5803fd606440aa3dae96cc52d1.png" alt="image" title="It was"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f65/59f/097/f6559f097c745d0759d0472a8d5aa04d.jpg" alt="image" title="It became"></a> <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúTom had a great time all this time, doing nothing and having fun, and the fence was covered with lime in three layers!

Be sure to read this chapter of the book. <br>  The title of this article is Tom's rephrased keyword phrase. </div></div><br>  The result of the work - a printed map with marks of unclear places will be given to a local medical assistant, <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAnd she will, as far as possible, sign that yes how.  Of course, it is not good to strain the doctors, but they themselves also need it ‚Äù(c) ErshKUS </blockquote><br><h2>  Video clip </h2><br>  Following the results of shock rendering, it was decided to make a video. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/bnvNEfMOORU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256&amp;usg=ALkJrhiL5KwuAuBBagazDBNjhfuUjdYqAA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Unlike <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/161975/">last time</a> , to create this video, it was necessary to shovel a much smaller amount of information.  It turned out that one <a href="http://gis-lab.info/projects/osm_dump/">dump from the GIS-Lab</a> area (RU-ORE-140122) and ten <a href="http://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/day/000/000/">daily</a> OSM <a href="http://planet.openstreetmap.org/replication/day/000/000/">diffs were sufficient</a> . <br>  The same processing scheme was used: <br><ul><li>  Filtering and sorting data homemade program </li><li>  Homemade render in SVG </li><li>  Convert to BMP via <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/">ImageMagick</a> </li><li>  Build video in <a href="http://avidemux.sourceforge.net/">avidemux</a> </li></ul><br>  Additionally were used <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://maperitive.net/">Maperitive</a> to create a starting frame (state of the map at noon on January 22) </li><li>  ImageMagick for fade in / out </li></ul><br>  An option was considered to render all frames in Maperitive or equivalent, but there is no highlighting of fresh changes, so the appearance of houses and other minor changes would be almost imperceptible.  In addition, it would be necessary to pull out all versions of all relations from the database. <br><br>  A set of OSM data can be <a href="http://ge.tt/1qz5GlI1/v/0">downloaded</a> (relation there is not all). <br>  Video without music is <a href="http://ge.tt/1qz5GlI1/v/1">uploaded as a file</a> (25 MB) under license CC-BY-SA 3.0 <br><br>  Felis Pimeja <a href="http://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php%3Fpid%3D394897">posted</a> his ani-gifs from episodic screenshots of mapnik. <br><br><h2>  Guess the melody </h2><br>  For this time, a track has been selected for music, which I have not been able to identify for 7 years.  Maybe someone from the audience or YouTube mechanism will tell me.  If you know what kind of music - write, please. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  In my opinion, the story of the rapid rendering of Krasnokholma perfectly demonstrates the advantages of OpenStreetMap: <br><ul><li>  If there is a source of data, information can be entered very quickly and at the same time it will immediately be available to everyone </li><li>  To fill in the data, sometimes a rather simple request ‚Äúdraw, please‚Äù </li><li>  OpenStreetMap is already used in the regions, despite the availability of commercial cards </li><li>  Discrepancies in the source data can be clarified on the ground and corrected in the database </li></ul><br>  UPD 2014-03-01 <br>  The world mind won, the music is identified, it <br>  Lily - It will rain quietly (instrumental) <br>  Thanks Erelen for the tip </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/211430/">https://habr.com/ru/post/211430/</a></p>
