In fact, it often happens to me, but the conversation is not about that.  The conversation was about which smartphones are more reliable than others. <br><br>  It turned out that the most recent research dates back to <a href="http://www.fixya.com/reports/phone-manufacturers">2013</a> , followed by <a href="https://www.squaretrade.com/cell-phone-comparison-study-nov-10">2010</a> .  And these studies were carried out by Big Serious Companies that have access to Big Data. <br><br>  The source of the data for the common man is obvious: the experience of the same ordinary people.  Driven by this idea, I opened the famous w3bsit3-dns.com forum and plunged into it headlong. <a name="habracut"></a>

      The story itself about how I filled up the tablet in Google Docs, of course, will not be interesting to anyone, so I‚Äôll frankly say that I took the number of pages in the discussion of the device (which, theoretically, is proportional to its popularity) and the number of pages in the discussion of the device‚Äôs marriage (what , theoretically, inversely proportional to the quality of its manufacture), and then divided the second by the first and got some abstract marriage coefficient.  Actually, it took much less time than trying to force a scatterplot in Google Sheets and LibreOffice Calc to display point captions.  As can be seen from the following graph, which is not a scatterplot, these attempts ended in complete failure: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2c/2c9/25f/c2c2c925fefb472a81a056673d55e700.png"></a> <br><br>  By the way, I had to throw out the Samsung Galaxy S6 from the table, because its reject rate was seven times higher than that of the smartphone following it, which unequivocally indicates an error (and again reminds that this reliability assessment method is not too far away from sticking a previously extracted nostril into the sky). <br><br>  In general, the results are a bit different than what I expected.  There are big doubts that the data on different platforms can be compared with each other: perhaps the high reject rate of Apple products is due to the fact that paid users a lot of money is much more demanding and not ready to put up with even minor flaws, and the leadership of smartphones on Windows Phone It can be explained by the fact that the topics devoted to them are mostly filled with holivars, and not with the responses of the owners.  In any case, we see a noticeable drop in quality in the latest generation of the iPhone.  Under Stalin, this was not. <br><br>  Nevertheless, the results among Android smartphones are quite entertaining.  Frank Zopo-type Chinese suddenly show very, very good results (although, of course, they can have a crooked firmware and slow down a lot, but this is no longer a marriage), the more eminent Chinese in the face of Meizu are not too far behind them, the Japanese from Sony clearly see the failure in quality in the region of 2013-2014, which is being actively eliminated, Koreans in the face of Samsung and LG frankly grieve. <br><br>  I hope this schedule, even if it smells slightly coffee grounds, will help someone choose a problem-free smartphone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/396167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/396167/</a></p>
