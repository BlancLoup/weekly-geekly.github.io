For my part, I will try to keep up to date. <br><br>  Next, the story itself: <br><br>  ‚ÄúOn Friday, June 25, at about 19.00, going to my website instead of my website, or rather to my website‚Äôs address, I saw a bunch of child porn and full links to SMS alarms, immediately checking the code for the main page - everything is fine, the system administrator calls - check DNS at RU-CENTER (in which the domain name registrar was served by wab.ru), I climb into the RU-CENTER control panel and ... I don‚Äôt find my domain there, I check it and see only other people's DNS.

      Calls to RU-CENTER followed, only operators who have access to the database are on the line to see where the domain has gone, but they cannot connect to anyone - all the staff have gone home and will be only on Monday ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  After two hours of chipping on the phone, I‚Äôm trying to get an answer - come tomorrow at 10.00, try to figure it out. <br><br>  In the morning I am at RU-CENTER and find out that yesterday at about 12.00 a person came to them, introduced myself, presented a passport (fake) in which my data was a series and number, but the photo of that unknown person was not my signature, after that he wrote application for the transfer of the domain vab.ru under the service of the registrar of domain names REG.RU, signed the necessary documents and deleted. <br><br>  Literally an hour and a half later, this unknown subject in a company with a certain city of Gaidai announced to REG.RU, where they sat for some time in the waiting room waiting for confirmation (which was delayed) from RU-CENTER about the transfer of a domain (according to reliable data, an unknown subject behaved calmly but the town of Gaidai was very nervous and several times called RU-CENTER with a request to speed up the transfer of the domain). <br><br>  <b>After confirming the transfer of the domain from RU-CENTER, an unknown subject, who again presented himself and presented a fake passport, writes a statement about the transfer of the domain to the ownership of the city of Gayday, which in return provides him with a receipt for 3 million rubles.</b> <br><br>  But I learned all this later, and Saturday at RU-CENTER I was told only one thing: the domain was transferred to another registrar and they could not do anything and at the same time asked if you had another document proving your identity other than your passport. <br><br>  I tried to call REG.RU, but there was Saturday and Sunday weekends and there was only a duty operator on the line, who again did not know anything. <br><br>  I talked with friends and acquaintances who could help everyone in this issue with only one conclusion - on weekends nothing can be done except to write a statement about the theft of a domain in the Economic Crime Department (Department for Combating Economic Crimes), which I did. <br><br>  On Monday, June 28, the first five days of the struggle for the domain began, first we go to REG.RU, there with surprised people review all my documents (including rights, passport and military ID) and answer that any data on the fact of the transfer of the domain to another to the person, as well as about who owns this domain now, they will provide only at the request of the DAEC, we are going to the DAEC, my application is still in the office, I am looking for the head of the department and ask to quickly transfer my application to the operas, and the slow and cumbersome state machine  on, the opera began to collect documents to initiate proceedings, and my friend and I, to speed up this process, rushed around Moscow for 5 days, collecting the necessary documents and yet not all the documents were collected, and even after I got a lock on Tuesday, June 29 on the same day, Gaidai wrote a statement on the same OBEP, that the domain belongs to him and he does not understand the reasons for the blocking and his statement also had to be attached to the case, and this is just too much time, but I hope that next week, the case will be transferred to the investigation and the process will go faster  e. <br><br>  For myself, I have so far made one conclusion that it is very easy and quick to steal a domain in the RU zone, and indeed in any zone that is served by Russian registrars, but to return (according to our laws) it is MUCH MORE or by decision of the investigator or by court . " <br><br>  <b><a href="http://setka.mobi/achtung.php">Original appeal and some details</a></b> <br><br>  <b>But what was found on the Internet:</b> <br>  "Dear users.  In connection with the generation of multiple rumors spread by non-formakers, I want to clarify the situation.  The former site owner Nikolai Podgursky contacted me and offered to purchase this project.  A rather large amount was announced.  However, considering the payback, I came to the conclusion that the project will pay for the investment.  After the negotiations, I agreed to buy this project for the amount announced.  However, after transferring the data to me and receiving money, an unknown person (I assume that the former owner himself) deleted all the contents of the site and hung up the alarms there.  Because of this, the rumor went that the site was hacked.  We managed to deal with the situation in a fairly short time.  The site was cleared from alarms and in the near future we will start restoring the services.  Yours faithfully New administration WAB.RU ¬ª <br><br>  In general, we get a very confusing story. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98269/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98269/</a></p>
