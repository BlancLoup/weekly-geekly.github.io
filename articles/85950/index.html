  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Freedom or fear. Make your choice</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today on Habr√© for me was an interesting mix of articles - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/my_business/55116/">wolf days</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/arbeit/85875/">the butterfly effect</a> .  It seems different such articles, and both hooked, forced to think.  And at first I couldn‚Äôt put the thoughts together and understand what unites these seemingly different articles.  And after a while it dawned on me - freedom of expression. <br><br>  This is a very important factor in the life of every person.  This is precisely what we lack - we are always afraid of something - that there is not enough money, that friends will not support, that society will judge.  We live by the laws that the majority sets, and we cannot become ourselves, because we are afraid of this mass - this majority. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Two thoughts inspired by different articles - one about the fear of being condemned by the majority, the other about trying, risking, changing your life and being successful, because finding your freedom, the one in which you are comfortable and collectively one.  And everyone had these two thoughts, but not everyone tried to listen to them and accept them as a guide to action.  We do not do small things and great accomplishments, because we are guided by the fear of condemnation, we cannot get our own cherished freedom of expression.

      I remember how I was afraid to write myself on a habr - I always thought that there were evil bearded men sitting there who would definitely tell me, a student girl, that I was wrong or I was writing obvious things.  My boss argued with a colleague that he would be at the forefront of the rating and achieved this.  But he is 26, and I was only 21, and besides, he is a candidate of technical sciences - his opinion is authoritative.  Of course, he was in the top ten, and I realized that I had nothing to confront with a habr. <br><br>  I remember how I studied at the institute - dreamed of my own business and understood that these were just dreams.  Making money for your business is very difficult, and a loan is a long-term bondage.  That we are so smart and talented we will always work as an uncle, because first you need to get dressed, buy a car - and then the family is on the way, children, you need to work and earn money on them, and not take risks and start your own business. <br><br>  And that's all.  Dreams were broken on the harsh everyday life.  My account was not created, although my acquaintances had invites, I worked for the boss and seemed to be happy.  Nearly.  But something was undermining me, I wanted to do and create, I wanted creative freedom, freedom of expression.  I looked around and saw companies that earned hundreds of thousands, although they were open recently, I saw young designers and photographers who chose their own way.  It was on the one hand.  On the other hand, there were parents who were talking about working at a bank, friends who complained about a salary of 10-15 thousand and dreamed of a mortgage.  It all came down in one line of my rails and I understood - you need to make your move.  One, quick and risky - to drop everything, to open a business - within a month everything happened.  And nothing - the earth did not stop, poverty did not come, the world did not collapse and remained the same.  Nothing has changed except my sense of self ‚Äî my freedom. <br><br>  This is a difficult choice - we want fewer problems, but we have more than enough desires.  It is much easier to say that the world is imperfect, and forget about its aspirations.  Why we remember the students, as the most fun and carefree time in their lives.  Because then it seemed to us that everything would surely turn out for us, that all the doors were open.  And nothing has changed since that time, our attitude has changed.  We are afraid of society, and in fact most of those whom we are so afraid only look scary or experts or something else.  The majority simply creates an image, looks like - and nothing more behind it.  And let them laugh, let them scold or try to offend - it only proves that you are remembered, that there is something in you that others do not have, since you call such attention.  And in general - what do you care about someone you do not even know.  And friends and relatives - they want to protect you from defeat and thereby inflame your fear.  But most of them have never tried and will not try to start their own business, and will continue to complain about low wages and poor leadership.  They are just like you are afraid to take risks, increasing your fear with yours.  Trying to change your life is an important attempt.  It can be different - move to Moscow, open your business, learn a new profession, start an independent life, or just write an article on Habr.  This attempt is important in that it allows you to look at the situation in a new way, try yourself in a new role and get rid of imposed stereotypes.  And this is very important. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85950/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85950/</a></p>
