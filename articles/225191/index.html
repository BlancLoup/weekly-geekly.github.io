Thanks to the IPO, the company attracted less than expected, but this is certainly a great success of Chinese social media resources.  Therefore, it is worth making a small overview of the existing Chinese social Internet resources.  Of course, he does not claim absolute completeness and objectivity, so feel free to write your additions and comments.

      Platforms and services, which will be discussed, have both a desktop and a mobile client, unless otherwise specified. <br>  It should also be remembered that many foreign resources, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and partly Wikipedia, are <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ifree/blog/238379/">blocked in the PRC</a> ; therefore, local residents use their Chinese counterparts, often not knowing about the existence of the originals.  In addition, everywhere there are lists of ‚Äúbad words‚Äù (mostly bad politically), input of which is blocked, or the activity of such users is carefully monitored.  By China, of course, we will have in mind its mainland, not counting Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, where the censorship of the Communist Party does not work. <br><br><h3>  Social media categories </h3><br>  There are different categorizations of social services.  Here we will analyze them so as to draw an analogy with Western services. <br>  Of course, each service, in addition to the main functionality, has many side capabilities, so for categorization we will focus only on the main purpose of this or that site / application. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Messaging (IM) </h5><br><h5>  Mobile networks </h5><br><h5>  Music Video </h5><br><h5>  Blog platforms </h5><br><h5>  Microblogging </h5><br><h5>  Social networks </h5><br><h5>  Forums </h5><br><h5>  Reviews and Reviews </h5><br><h5>  Electronic commerce </h5><br><h5>  Tourist sites </h5><br><h5>  Dating </h5><br><h5>  Business network </h5><br><h5>  Light Blogging </h5><br><h5>  Share photos and pictures </h5><br><h5>  Video sharing </h5><br><h5>  Encyclopedic sites </h5><br><h5>  "Social Shopping" </h5><br><br><h3>  Messaging (IM) </h3><br>  It is quite difficult to clearly categorize IM services due to their rapid growth, aimed only at mobile users.  Here we will try to break the purely mobile services and universal networks.  As a "reference" service we take Twitter (controversial moment). <br><br>  <b>QQ IM [ <a href="http://www.imqq.com/">Q</a> - <a href="http://www.imqq.com/">Q</a> ] - <a href="http://www.imqq.com/">www.imqq.com</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/895/37a/d01/89537ad015a7e000594de811f92bd4be.jpg"><br><br>  Tencent QQ is the main and most famous (hereinafter, in China, of course) messaging service.  Initially it was a desktop text messaging platform.  In the future, it acquired functionality (similar to ICQ), and went to mobile phones.  With it, you can not only exchange messages, but also plan events, make video and audio calls (including group calls), listen to music, play games.  There is even its own payment system for games and services - <i>QQ Coins</i> , as well as a microblogging service (only people who you explicitly allow it can read posts).  It is also worth noting that there are no third-party clients, the protocol is closed, and directly from the application interface you can complain about spammers or propaganda personalities. <br><br>  At the beginning of 2013, QQ (desktop and mobile versions) has 200 million active users with 623 million registered accounts. <br><br>  <b>Feixin  ‰ø° [feixin] - <a href="http://www.webim.feixin.10086.cn/">www.webim.feixin.10086.cn</a></b> <br>  Feixin is a platform from the operator China Mobile (you can draw an analogy with a VoIP messenger from Megaphone, for example).  Appeared on the market earlier than WeChat (mobile application from the same Tencent company), but failed to gain popularity of the latter.  This service for 2013 has a 100-million monthly audience, although it is not used too actively. <br><br>  <b>Aliwangwang ÈòøÈáå Êó∫Êó∫ [Ali Van Wang] <a href="http://im.alisoft.com/">im.alisoft.com</a></b> <br>  This is the messenger for Taobao trading platform.  Used to communicate sellers and buyers.  In China, it is customary to communicate with the seller before purchasing goods (you can bargain for free shipping, or knock out a discount), and sellers like to duplicate notifications and send advertisements to old buyers through personal messages, so they use the service quite actively. <br><br>  <b>Baidu Hi ÁôæÂ∫¶ Hi [Baidu Hi] <a href="http://im.alisoft.com/">im.baidu.com</a> /</b> <br>  Of course, the largest search service in China also has its own messenger.  This is not the most popular means of communication, but it reflects the desire of the giant to strengthen its presence in all major Internet areas. <br>  Mobile networks <br><br><h3>  Mobile networks (analog WatsApp) </h3><br>  <b>WeChat ÂæÆ ‰ø° [weixin], [Weixin] <a href="http://www.wechat.com/">www.wechat.com</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9f7/452/eab/9f7452eab61055e9cd71930f2392ee9c.jpg"><br><br>  This is the most dynamic platform of Tencent.  At present, the monthly audience of active users is about 355 million, with about 100 million registered outside of China.  In addition to sending messages, voice and video communications (including "Internet radio mode"), the application can install games (and share the results with friends a la Google Play Games), has a built-in similarity of Instagram (called ÊúãÂèã- ‚ÄúCircle of friends‚Äù for photo sharing), allows you to join communities or subscribe to company updates (community QR codes are posted everywhere).  The application itself is free, has built-in purchases - for example, sets of emoticons are sold. <br><br>  <b>Yixin Êòì ‰ø° [Y-blue] <a href="http://im.alisoft.com/">yixin.im</a></b> <br>  China mobile together with NetEase are also fighting for this niche.  The difference from WeChat is that the user of the application can send text messages not only to the same users, but also to any cell phone number. <br><br>  <b>Momo Èôå Èôå [Mo Mo Mo] <a href="http://www.immomo.com/">www.immomo.com</a></b> <br>  This is a purely mobile application that is positioned as a means to find friends, in fact being something like a dating site (with a known purpose).  The application uses geolocation to search for other users around and send messages. <br><br>  <b>Laiwang Êù•ÂæÄ [Lai Wang] <a href="http://www.laiwang.com/">www.laiwang.com</a></b> <br>  This is a messenger from the Alibab group of companies - with the help of it, the company is trying to enter the market of mobile messaging systems.  Today, it lags behind WeChat (main competitor) in the number of users and the amount of embedded services. <br><br><h3>  Music Video </h3><br>  Services for streaming video and listening to music are very popular in China.  There are several analogues of YouTube, which make good money on a rather intrusive advertising. <br>  Chinese users do not feel completely deprived of the lack of YouTube, and at every corner you can meet people who watch videos and TV shows from their mobile devices and computers. <br><br>  <b>Youku ‰ºò ÈÖ∑ [Yuku] <a href="http://www.youku.com/">www.youku.com</a></b> and <b>Tudou ÂúüË±Ü [Tudou] <a href="http://www.tudou.com/">www.tudou.com</a></b> <br>  These two services are the most popular in China.  Since 2012, both platforms are owned by Youku.  The interface largely copies YouTube. <br><br>  Users have the ability to upload videos of arbitrary length and share with friends.  Portals have partnership agreements with the majority of copyright holders in China, so they regularly upload fresh content to their pages. <br>  True, one cannot but make a reservation: there is very strict censorship on political topics, therefore all content is constantly moderated (both automatically, with a list of "bad" words, and manually).  The same applies, vince, and all other Chinese services. <br><br>  <b>Sohu ÊêúÁãê ËßÜÈ¢ë [Sohu] <a href="http://tv.sohu.com/">tv.sohu.com</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/470/ce9/6f5/470ce96f543ab619dc0e0f96f71c3e27.png"><br><br>  A similar service, also very popular in mainland China.  Even icon design copies Youtube. <br><br>  <b>Xiami ËôæÁ±≥ [Syami] <a href="http://www.xiami.com/">www.xiami.com</a></b> <i>(not to be confused with Xiaomi - phone maker)</i> <br>  Alibaba music service introduced in 2013.  A very popular music platform among young people. <br><br>  <b>PPTV - <a href="http://www.pptv.com/">www.pptv.com</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bdb/b06/8cf/bdbb068cf05b02f0165767fd185e7954.jpg"><br><br>  Famous p2p video viewing application.  The repertoire is practically unlimited - starting with the Korean TV series (extremely popular in China), ending with the novelties of Hollywood (content licensing is a separate issue). <br><br><h3>  Blog platforms </h3><br>  In China, there are many copies of Google‚Äôs Blogger (completely blocked in China). <br><br>  <b>Blogbus - <a href="http://www.blogbus.com/">www.blogbus.com</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d88/a98/6ba/d88a986baa93f6049d1167c59dfc9f1f.jpg"><br><br>  Known paid blog platform. <br><br>  <b>36kr 36 Ê∞™ (Krypton) <a href="http://www.36kr.com/">www.36kr.com</a></b> <br>  A platform for sharing information on startups.  Here young entrepreneurs receive information on the latest trends in the IT sphere. <br><br>  <b>SocialBeta - <a href="http://www.socialbeta.com/">www.socialbeta.com</a></b> <br><br>  This platform in some way copies mashable.com.  Here you can find a lot of information on social services and IT. <br><br>  <b>Sohu blog ÊêúÁãê ÂçöÂÆ¢ [Sohu Boke] <a href="http://www.blog.sohu.com/">www.blog.sohu.com</a></b> <br><br>  Sohu blogs are popular among Chinese Internet users. <br><br>  <b>Sina blog Êñ∞Êµ™ ÂçöÂÆ¢ [Xinlan Boke] <a href="http://blog.sina.com.cn/">blog.sina.com.cn</a></b> <br>  Well, the most popular blog platform is Sina Weibo. <br><br><h3>  Microblogging </h3><br>  Twitter a la Twitter is incredibly popular in China.  Of course, there are some differences here - for example, for the Chinese, the restriction of 140 characters is not such a problem, since in this volume, using hieroglyphs, one can fit much more information than in alphabetic languages. <br><br>  <b>Sina Weibo Êñ∞Êµ™ ÂæÆ Âçö [Sina Weibo] or [Xinlan Weibo] <a href="http://www.weibo.com/">www.weibo.com</a></b> <br>  Sina became a public company on April 17, 2014.  Her most famous service is Sina Weibo, an analogue of Twitter.  Daily in the service published about 100 million entries.  There is an opinion that Weibo can lose ground with the advent of WeChat, however, it should be borne in mind that almost all active users of the Chinese network have an account on Weibo, and it is too early to write it off. <br><br>  <b>Tencent Weibo ËÖæËÆØ ÂæÆ Âçö [Tensun Weibo] <a href="http://reg.t.qq.com/">reg.t.qq.com</a></b> <br>  A similar service from the company Tencent, much inferior in the audience to its competitor from Sina. <br><br>  <b>Sohu Weibo ÊêúÁãê ÂæÆ Âçö [Sohu Weibo] <a href="http://t.sohu.com/new_index">t.sohu.com</a></b> <br>  Another microblogging service from the major search engine Sohu.  In popularity also lags behind competitors in the market. <br><br>  <b>NetEase Weibo ÁΩëÊòì ÂæÆ Âçö [Wang and Weibo] <a href="http://t.163.com/session">t.163.com</a></b> <br>  Microblogging platform from popular Chinese resource 163.com <br><br><h3>  Social networks </h3><br>  Social networks are analogs of Facebook, Vkontakte, etc. The first in China has been blocked since 2008, at the same time similar Chinese services have received an impetus to the development. <br><br>  <b>QZone (QQ Á©∫Èó¥) <a href="http://user.qzone.qq.com/787195984">qzone.qq.com</a></b> <br>  The QQ Zone network is part of Tencent‚Äôs services.  If you have an account in QQ IM, you can use the network immediately.  There are groups, embedded microblogging, photo albums, the ability to listen to music and watch videos. <br><br>  <b>Renren ‰∫∫‰∫∫ ÁΩë [Ren-jen Wang] (‚Äúnetwork of many people‚Äù) <a href="http://www.renren.com/">www.renren.com</a></b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e70/92b/4ed/e7092b4edc8da5b2df99a18cea6bcf04.jpg"><br><br>  Renren - like Vkontakte, started by copying Facebook.  However, unlike the domestic service, in many respects the copying (with Chinese characteristics) continues to this day. <br><br>  The service also helps in finding friends by place of residence, study or work.  Of the features, it should be noted that the network positions itself as a ‚Äúsocial network with real names‚Äù, and since the target audience is residents of the People‚Äôs Republic of China, registration is possible only with a hieroglyphic name (and no longer than ordinary Chinese names - transcription of a long Russian name like ÂºóÊãâÂü∫Á±≥Â∞î, for example, the system will not accept), and in the ‚Äúplace of birth‚Äù section only Chinese provinces are listed. <br>  Today, the popularity of the network is declining, but the audience is still approximately 194 million people, of whom a third visits the network from mobile phones.  The main audience - schoolchildren and students who, after graduation, go to other networks. <br><br>  <b>Pengyou ÊúãÂèã ÁΩë [Pengyu Wang] (‚Äúnetwork of friends‚Äù) <a href="http://www.pengyou.com/">www.pengyou.com</a></b> <br>  Pengyou is another popular Chinese social network.  Today, the audience is about 200 million users, the emphasis is also placed on real names and on adding real friends.  As in Facebook, users can subscribe to company pages. <br><br>  <b>Kaixin001 ÁΩë [Kaixin-van] (‚ÄúHappiness Network‚Äù) <a href="http://www.kaixin001.com/">www.kaixin001.com</a></b> <br>  Kaixin 001 is owned by Oak Pacific Interactive, the owner of Renren.  The success of the network is not least due to copying flash games from Facebook, thanks to which the network has gained a reputation for playing the game. <br><br><h3>  Forums </h3><br>  Forums (which in China are called exclusively "BBS") are very popular. <br><br>  <b>Tianya Â§©Ê∂Ø [Tien-i] (‚Äúthe end of the world‚Äù) <a href="http://www.tianya.cn/bbs">www.tianya.cn/bbs</a></b> <br>  This forum provides BBS services, a blog platform, microblogging, a photo and video exchange platform.  The forum is one of the most popular in mainland China, even politicians and officials resort to its help. <br><br>  <b>Liba ÁØ±Á¨Ü ÁΩë [Liba-van] <a href="http://www.liba.com/">www.liba.com</a></b> and <b>KDSlife <a href="http://www.kdslife.com/">www.kdslife.com</a></b> <br>  These two forums are focused on the Shanghai audience - here the events of the city are covered, the local residents communicate. <br><br>  <b>Autohome Ê±ΩËΩ¶ ‰πã ÂÆ∂ - <a href="http://www.autohome.com.cn/">www.autohome.com.cn</a></b> <br>  As the name implies - a forum dedicated to automotive topics.  Photos are published on the auto-theme, announcements about buying or selling, news from the world of the automotive industry. <br><br>  <b>Maopu Áå´ Êâë [Maopu-wang] <a href="http://www.mop.com/">www.mop.com</a></b> <br>  Mop.com is one of the most popular Chinese forums.  Known as an interactive music portal, as well as the local homeland of memes and Internet slang (compare with Lepre). <br><br>  <b>Baidu tieba ÁôæÂ∫¶ Ë¥¥ Âêß [Baidu Teba] tieba.baidu.com</b> <br>  Part of the search service Baidu.  It is an online community for discussing certain issues (there is a certain similarity with the ‚ÄúMail.ru answers‚Äù). <br><br><h3>  Reviews and Reviews </h3><br>  Chinese consumers actively leave comments about certain goods and services.  Below are the services that allow you to leave such reviews and share with other users. <br><br>  <b>Dazhong Dianping Â§ß‰ºó ÁÇπËØÑ [Dazhong Dianping] <a href="http://www.dianping.com/citylist">www.dianping.com/citylist</a></b> <br>  This service helps in finding restaurants, bars, shops, fitness centers and other establishments.  Here users can rate places and leave their impressions of the visit.  You can search through the choice of the city and category, or through the usual search field. <br><br>  <b>Douban Ë±ÜÁì£ [Douban] <a href="http://www.douban.com/">www.douban.com</a></b> <br>  Douban began as a review service for books, films, and music in 2005 (known analogues are Imhonet, kinopoisk).  Today, the service has become a very popular social network.  The most famous among the educated urban population (students and white collar workers).  As of 2013, the number of registered users is about 72 million with a 200 millionth attendance per month. <br><br>  A noticeable difference from other social networks is that it is not necessary to have an account to use its resources.  In other words, ratings for films, books and music are accessible to ordinary visitors, and after registration recommendations and social functions become available. <br><br>  <b>Gewara Ê†ºÁì¶Êãâ ÁîüÊ¥ª [Gavala Shenho] ‚Äã‚Äãor [Guevara Life] <a href="http://www.gewara.com/">www.gewara.com</a></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c8/61d/f74/0c861df7473cd075350054bbb519e964.gif"><br>  In addition to ratings and ratings, the platform allows you to book tickets for cultural and sports events (concerts, championships), as well as movie tickets.  <i>Yes, the site is called Guevara, without Che, but about him</i> . <br><br>  <b>Douban movie Ë±ÜÁì£ ËßÜÈ¢ë [Douban Shipyin] <a href="http://movie.douban.com/">movie.douban.com</a></b> <br>  Service from Douban, sharpened on movies (the functionality is similar to Guevara). <br><br>  <b>Xiachufang ‰∏ã Âé®Êàø [Shachufang] (‚Äúcooking in the kitchen‚Äù) <a href="http://www.xiachufang.com/">www.xiachufang.com</a></b> <br>  Site dedicated to cooking.  Recipes, tips, information about products - everything is here.  There are both desktop and mobile versions.  To the credit of the creators of the portal, the interface for the Chinese Internet looks clean and concise.  <i>The author of the original article says that the site will help to avoid eating a rat in a Chinese eatery, because with it you can cook at home.</i>  <i>Given the monolingual nature of the portal, for a foreigner this is a questionable utility advice.</i> <br><br>  <b>Jiepang Ë°óÊóÅ [Jie-pan] (‚Äústreet‚Äù) <a href="http://jiepang.com/">jiepang.com</a></b> <br>  Jiepang copies the functionality of Foursquare - you can cheek and share with friends, create interest groups.  Mobile application is present on iOS and Android. <br><br>  <b>Liuliu ÈÅõÈÅõ [Liu] (‚Äúwalk‚Äù) <a href="http://liuliu.co/">liuliu.co</a></b> <br>  This is a newly emerging mobile (iOS) social network for pet owners - love dogs and cats share photos of their pets, can organize joint walks, and also look for new owners or partners for mating for them (no matter how funny it sounds). <br><br>  <b>M-time Êó∂ÂÖâ ÁΩë [ <a href="http://www.mtime.com/">Shiguang</a> Wang] <a href="http://www.mtime.com/">www.mtime.com</a></b> <br>  Movie review portal, an analogue of IMBD blocked in China. <br><br><h3>  E-commerce </h3><br>  Online shopping in China is incredibly popular.  At least 300 million people make online purchases, with a total of 618 million users.  Alibaba is the largest player in this market, but it also has competitors. <br><br>  <b>Taobao Ê∑òÂÆùÁΩë<a href="http://taobao.com/">taobao.com</a></b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17d/e0f/e78/17de0fe789de811076611469c90056c9.jpg"><br>  All known Taobao - the largest trading platform in the likeness of eBay, belongs to Alibaba.  Both large companies (mainly on the special section Tmall.com) and private individuals act as sellers - the threshold for entering the business for the Chinese is rather low, which, however, is accompanied by extreme competition.  Not a small role in the popularity and availability of making online purchases is played by an over-developed network of fast delivery services - low prices for deliveries in the country plus high speed of order fulfillment.  The payment system is also well built, in which the seller receives money for the goods only after confirmation of receipt from the buyer - until this point, the payment system is retained by the Alipay payment system. <br><br>  <b>Jingdong ‰∫¨‰∏ú [Jingdong] JD.com</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/113/a34/e0a/113a34e0afb3a1582e6e2c47293f04bf.jpg"><br><br>  JD.com (formerly 360Buy) is the second most popular site after Taobao.  First of all, it is a B2C-platform with well-established logistics.
