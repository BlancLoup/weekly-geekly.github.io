  <section class="page js-page"><h1>10 things on the Internet that are furious, or why the Web will really die</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A post in support of ‚ÄúAbout the demise of the old dirty Web or the Legend of the life-giving sensor‚Äù ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/96115/">http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/eCommerce/96115/</a> ).  It seems to me that the author is clearly underestimated, and he‚Äôs just a mega-brain.  Guys remove your blinders.  No need to demand from a person who intuitively displays trends to tell how he does it.  This by itself is obtained when the amount of information on any issue exceeds a certain level.  As a former political analyst, I understand this perfectly. <br><br>  The author argued that next to the Internet there will be a new Internet, on tablets and set-top boxes.  Internet on closed systems, the monetization in which will occur on a completely different from today's scheme.  I will call this Internet VIP Internet.  And the reasons for its occurrence lie not only in the evolution of "hardware" and "software", but also in consumer dissatisfaction with today's Internet.  Below I will describe 10 things that annoy me as a user of the global network and the presence of which, in my opinion, is a prerequisite for the emergence of an alternative to WWW. <br><br>  By the way, now a way to solve any of the problems listed above can become a business idea. <a name="habracut"></a>  Approximately broken, the numbering is arbitrary, many points are interdependent and interdependent.

      1. <b>Viruses.</b>  How many times has the number of viruses increased over the past year?  Somewhere I heard a figure that in 400. But even five years ago I did without antivirus, or it could be updated once a month, and even more rarely.  And now?  Everyday!  Moreover, half of antiviruses are ineffective.  Already, I would give the money that goes to the purchase of antivirus licenses to subscribe to the VIP Internet.  If he was safe. <br><br>  2. <b>Spam</b> .  In fairness, I will say that if you regularly and consistently "complain about spam", then even mail.ru can work more or less decently.  But this does not remove the problem.  And how much spam in social networks?  And in the comments?  It is impossible to read.  Will there be spam, for example, on the network on the iPad?  I strongly doubt that this means plus for VIP Internet and closed networks. <br><br>  3. <b>Richmedia</b> .  For such an ad would have hit the monitor on the "face".  When the entire screen is suddenly closed by the advertisement, and the little cancellation cross is tiny (God forbid, it doesn‚Äôt run away from the mouse), emotions start to overflow.  I do not want to see it.  Who to pay for this to happen? <br><br>  4. <b>Pornography</b> .  I was looking for cartoons for the child.  I drove something like "Shrek download online", etc.  Easy open links to sites offering such services.  Guess, advertising and pop-up windows of what kind they are filled?  If I had a wife, my ears would turn red.  In the free access of such things should not be.  Fee - please.  And in good quality.  At the same time you can check this area. <br><br>  5. <b>Scammers</b> .  Consoles the idea that people who make a fake website that collects money for the treatment of a child will burn in hell forever.  But I would like them to live poorly in this life.  And this means that there should be no place for such things in the network.  In the VIP-Internet such sites should be completely eradicated.  The state can fork out for it ... <br><br>  6. <b>Lack of adequate paid services</b> .  Continuation of the story with ‚ÄúShrek‚Äù (see p. 4).  Offer to download a movie in good quality for 40 rubles.  I agree, where to pay?  And, here: ‚Äúsend SMS to number XXX‚Äù.  We assume that there is no point 5 and try to send it.  "Mistake".  One more time.  "Mistake".  Well, the third, according to tradition ... Damn, already enrages !!!  So what is on other sites?  In short, the situation is the same.  Ah, I have a tele2, so it does not work!  What a pity!  Why there are no electronic versions of films at the price of a normal divide?  I would buy, saving on gasoline and time.  I hope in the future, there will be such a service on the VIP Internet. <br><br>  7. <b>Search rubbish</b> .  God forbid, if you are looking for "Ivanov", or Avangard company.  Ready for X million pages?  The algorithms of search robots in secret (we do not need mortals to know how they work), how they are looking for is not clear.  Even SEOs have made their contribution: get not something that more corresponds to the request, but what the search robot found faster.  And another bonus - you will be still on mail.ru to receive contextual advertising in accordance with requests.  I wanted to make a surprise for my wife - I looked for something on the Internet.  She comes into her box - she is full of links.  ‚ÄúYou were looking for perfume?  Here they are in bulk. "  And if you look for a cure for hemorrhoids?  And not at home, but in the office?  With the search you need to do something.  There are projects, I know.  The issue is investment.  And it seems to me that they will come to VIP-Internet faster. <br><br>  8. <b>Screaming headlines and affiliate links</b> .  ‚ÄúSemenovich was killed!‚Äù, ‚ÄúWe will never see this actor!‚Äù, ‚ÄúEveryone was waiting for this smartphone!‚Äù  And ... it turns out they were killed in the clip, the actor just left the country, but about the smartphone - in general, the press release of the manufacturer.  Personally, I haven‚Äôt clicked on these links for a long time, but their abundance on sites is simply amazing.  And on serious information sites.  Attention distracts terribly and does not correspond to reality.  Do we have a little yellow press?  Another "yellow Internet" need?  The following is associated with this item: <br><br>  10. <b>Surface and informational vacuum</b> .  The Internet, like any other media in terms of non-specialized sites, is extremely superficial.  Like any other media, the Internet is created by journalists, and, unlike serious media, where anyone does not take, there is almost no entry threshold.  Plus the specificity of monetization.  As a result, information nonsense, advertising, "hot" news.  Professionals, of course, sit on their sites.  And what to do if you are saved from TV on the Internet?  News on the first channel (and everything else) have long been seen? <br><br>  And the last little things: <br><br>  9. <b>Registration</b> .  Why register permanently!  Zadolbali already!  Let my computer be registered somewhere.  I went with him, I can see who I am and what I am.  Well, ok, I also registered the OS.  That's right.  So much time will save.  Oh, and also here: <br><br>  <b>Protection from robots</b> .  Yandex, damn it!  I am alive, alive!  Although if you constantly change the layout and abracadabra to type on the keyboard life will be reduced, that's for sure.  Why such protection is needed - it is clear (again, spammers, scammers, viruses).  Is there an alternative to www?  I doubt it.  Let's hope evolutionary die. <br><br>  <b>findings</b> <br>  All these things make the Internet less convenient and even insecure.  However, they cannot be cured in the existing environment.  Bans and draconian measures will not help - throw out the water along with the baby.  At the same time, it is time to evolve the Internet.  These processes are inevitable, everything becomes obsolete.  Obsolete and the Internet.  It is in our selfish interests to understand as soon as possible where and what is moving in order to get ahead of the mega-monsters of the industry at the expense of its mobility and take its rightful place in the sun.  It is desirable among these monsters. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96591/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96591/</a></p>
