  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Experience of transporting a computer on the plane</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I flew many times on airplanes, and several times, in particular, carried a computer with me.  In some cases, it was only a system unit, in another part of cases - a system unit with a monitor (NEC, 23 ", with a leg). <br><br>  I thought that this experience might be interesting to someone else, who might also want to go somewhere, and perhaps also take a computer with me. <br><br>  If we are talking about carrying a laptop, then everything is easier - just put it in a bag and put it on your shoulder.  Immediately we will talk about a large, desktop computer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Carry-on or luggage? </h1><br>  I tried to carry the system unit in hand luggage, but I can not say that it is convenient.  It is difficult to place it on the plane (especially if other passengers also have a lot of things), and if you are carrying something else in your carry-on baggage (I also had an electric guitar in my case), then it will obviously be hard for you.

      Plus there is one more nuance - you have to carry it without a suitcase (the suitcase in which it fits will be too large).  And this is also not very convenient, besides, when you arrive, the customs may be interested in your system unit, and request a fee. <br><br>  Therefore, it would be better to carry the system unit in the luggage. <br><br><h1>  Suitcase </h1><br>  First of all, you should choose a good suitcase.  Be careful, measure the exact dimensions of the system unit, and make sure that it fits inside the suitcase.  I have encountered such cases when the size of a suitcase is indicated, but this is the size of the suitcase itself, and not the space inside it.  Therefore, before buying it is best to measure the inner space of the suitcase yourself. <br><br>  Should I buy a suitcase in the store, or buy used?  Personally, I think it's better to be used.  Firstly, there is likely to be a significant difference in price.  You can buy for the allocated amount of money a bad new suitcase, or a good used one.  And to buy a good new one, respectively, it will take much more money.  However, there is another nuance here - if the suitcase does not look new, then this is only a plus.  The fact is that when baggage arrives at the destination airport, it folds onto a moving belt, and I have never seen it checked somehow, people are taking off their luggage or not.  This means that if your baggage looks good on the outside, then someone might want to steal it.  In addition, customs may want to additionally inspect such baggage, and, possibly, to ask you for a fee for transporting a computer. <br><br>  By the way, one more thing.  Sometimes it happens that someone has the same suitcase as you have.  Therefore, when you remove the suitcase from the tape, then read the tag on it and make sure that it is really your suitcase. <br><br>  In addition to the size of the suitcase, pay attention to the frame.  Keep in mind that things will not be folded neatly - they will be thrown, they will be thrown at each other, including they will be thrown on top of your things.  It is better to choose a suitcase that has a frame on all sides, in particular, from above.  I drove a system unit a couple of times in a suitcase, which was soft on top, as a result, dents appeared on the system unit, and the lid stopped closing in the usual way (it still closes, but you need to press it in several places for this). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/953/7a3/afe/9537a3afe59f6eb1ca842b7390b0b939.jpg" alt="System unit"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7b1/fb1/a3f/7b1fb1a3f5428a709853d8ed7ab275de.jpg" alt="System unit"><br><br>  However, the motherboard and other equipment remained in order - due to careful packaging. <br><br><h1>  Packaging </h1><br>  The main purpose of packaging is to make sure that there is no empty space between the internal components of the computer and the walls of the case.  The easiest way to do this is to stuff more clothes inside.  If you fly with your wife (or girl), then finding enough clothes to take with you will not be a problem.  Make sure to fill the inner space of the system unit tightly enough, but at the same time, be careful with some clothes - for example, anything made of wool can hit the chips with static electricity, and lightning, buttons, and other items of plastic or iron clothing, again, can damage internal components - so make sure that such parts do not come into contact with the chips. <br><br>  Similarly, you need to fill the space between the system unit and the walls of the suitcase.  But here it is already easier - because you do not risk damaging the internal components.  You can even use something more rigid than clothes (for example, cardboard boxes, or something else). <br><br>  Winchester makes sense to pull out and carry separately in hand luggage.  Moreover, it does not take up much space. <br><br><h1>  Monitor </h1><br>  If, in addition to the system unit, you are carrying a monitor, then you should take it with you on a plane, that is, carry it in your hand luggage.  It should be wrapped in something that does not damage the screen (I used the packaging in which it was originally in the box), and after that it can be even in several layers with something else (t-shirts, towels, sheets, and etc).  In the case of my monitor, it also made sense to unscrew the leg and carry it separately, in the luggage - because it weighs about 7 kg and takes quite a lot of space. <br><br><h1>  Weight </h1><br>  When packing things, watch the weight.  Usually there are formal restrictions for baggage and for hand luggage, but in reality hand luggage is often heavier and larger in size than allowed in the rules. <br><br>  That is, on regular flights you can usually carry a lot of hand luggage.  But on the charter or low-cost may require compliance with formal rules. <br><br>  An important point, which not everyone knows - if you fly together, the maximum weight of the baggage is added up.  This means that if the weight limit is 20 kg, then for two it will be 40 kg, and these 40 kg can be arbitrarily distributed among the bags.  However, there is another limitation - one bag should not be more than 32 kg in weight (this is a limitation of the loaders, they refuse to lift things heavier than 32 kg - although it seems that for a separate surcharge you can still agree).  Thus, it is possible, for example, to carry two bags - one 32 kg, and the other 8 kg.  However, here it is necessary to understand that these are the rules of those airlines where I specified it.  For reliability, it is worth clarifying the rules for the airline you are flying to.  By the way, if the airline is not Russian, but they have a Russian partner (and its phone number is listed on the airline's website), then there is a chance that the Russian partner will give you completely different information.  Therefore, if possible, it is worth contacting representatives of this airline. <br><br>  Thus, we see that it is not so difficult to transport a computer by plane.  It is enough to get the necessary information and prepare, and then you will have to pack your computer, and then pull it out of the bag, unpack and assemble it in a new place. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/140670/">https://habr.com/ru/post/140670/</a></p>
