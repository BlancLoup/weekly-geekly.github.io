  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Rise of the Machines: Five Office Professions Threatened by Robots</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For years, people thought robots would take their bread.  Researchers at the University of Oxford in 2013 <a href="http://www.futuretech.ox.ac.uk/future-employment-how-susceptible-are-jobs-computerisation-oms-working-paper-dr-carl-benedikt-frey-m">estimated</a> that by 2033, 47% of all work in the United States would be performed by machines.  Other experts are confident that technology creates highly skilled jobs, rather than replacing workers.  But big data and the development of machines allow them to perform high-level cognitive tasks. <br><br>  Some <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/02/25/5-jobs-that-robots-already-are-taking/">office professions</a> are under threat.  Moreover, even the need for live doctors can be reduced.  Under the cut - five examples. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f3e/c8a/51f/f3ec8a51fb3eee6f81a38e8b7071016b.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Financial and sports reporters </h4><br>  The journalist collects information, interviews, answers the questions who, what, where, when, why and how, and records the results - this is a daily routine.  But if this information can be found, read and understood by the car - it has the potential to become an excellent reporter.

      The Associated Press in June 2014 began <a href="http://blog.ap.org/2015/01/29/automated-earnings-stories-multiply/">creating corporate income reports</a> using Insights software and data from Zacks Investment Research.  After eliminating errors, the process has become fully automated. <br><br>  The sports department of the Associated Press automated reporting on events with a small audience.  So the publication saves the time of live reporters who can take more interesting activities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3b1/b36/86c/3b1b3686cec688bac919543924582385.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Internet sellers </h4><br>  Natural language software from Persado determines which letter subject is most likely to find a response. <br><br>  The company worked with clients such as Citi Financial Conglomerate and clothing manufacturer Neiman Marcus.  The system analyzes messages and creates formulations that will trigger a positive emotional response.  The machine tests thousands of formulations to find the best versions.  As a result, letters with automatically generated topics are twice as often open as those written by a living person. <br><br>  Great potential is in purchasing advertising systems.  Instead of selecting sites for a living person, software, using billions of pieces of information about potential customers, targets advertising using the most appropriate resources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ca/3a9/a9c/9ca3a9a9cc2c9a9ec300e6f9d4fc1180.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Anaesthesiologists, surgeons and diagnosticians </h4><br>  You may not trust your <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/246374/">health to the applications</a> , but you can entrust the preparation for the examination with the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303983904579093252573814132">automatic system</a> from Johnson &amp; Johnson - the US regulator has already approved it for sedation before colonoscopy and other manipulations.  The person is still needed, but one specialist will be able to work with several machines, so the number of anesthesiologists per clinic may decrease. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bfd/be1/5e0/bfdbe15e08b624541becd74002e8a43a.png" width="350" alt="image"><br><br>  The IBM Watson supercomputer, widely known for its victory in the American counterpart of Own Game, <a href="http://www.qmed.com/news/ibms-watson-could-diagnose-cancer-better-doctors">defines lung cancer better than humans</a> : in 90 percent of cases, versus 50 - among doctors.  A supercomputer can <a href="http://www-935.ibm.com/services/multimedia/MSK_Case_Study_IMC14794.pdf">monitor</a> patient health <a href="http://www-935.ibm.com/services/multimedia/MSK_Case_Study_IMC14794.pdf">much better</a> , and get much more information about tests in real time.  The company launched <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/ibm/blog/250903/">the Watson for Oncology program</a> : Watson asks questions and makes assumptions using data from the latest oncology medical research, a patient's medical record and symptoms.  A doctor needs to sleep, eat and spend time with his family. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/uBFZZxAyOzc&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgrqFkefX66bwcuFbqWk8NIkHCAGg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Surgeons are already using <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/vc/blog/239473/">robotic systems</a> as assistants in minimally invasive interventions.  For the time being, the surgeon often performs the main role - for example, he controls the da Vinci robot.  But some operations are already performed independently by the robots: in 2012, in nine hours, Da Vinci <a href="http://newsland.com/news/detail/id/1061649/">performed a heart operation</a> through a three and a half centimeters hole.  Surgeons followed the operation, ready to take over control - but it was not needed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7be/3a7/ef9/7be3a7ef93f173367fe3ac4ca80f112b.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Lawyers and legal advice </h4><br>  For successful work in court, a lawyer must shovel a huge amount of materials for each particular case - especially in countries where a case law is used.  Traditionally, this task was laid on the shoulders of young lawyers, graduates of educational institutions.  Now this responsibility can be performed by software. <br><br>  Systems use syntactic analysis and keyword recognition, scanning emails, texts, databases, scanned documents to find all the information you need for a particular case.  It is possible that in the future, Watson will be able not only to diagnose patients, but also to help lawyers. <br><br>  The most highly paid lawyers are those who are able to predict the arguments of opponents, who are able to assess the possible outcome of the case, knowing past decisions and the particular features of a particular judge.  At the University of Michigan and the University of South Texas Law College, a statistical model was created that was <a href="http://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2014/using-data-to-predict-supreme-courts-decisions/">able to predict the outcome of seventy-one cases</a> before the US Supreme Court. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ec/1f0/b70/8ec1f0b70dd7c9137e4458132e189a02.jpg" width="400" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Financial analysts and advisors </h4><br>  Predictive systems, big data and growing computer capacities allow you to create tools for analyzing and predicting the success of investments.  A vivid example of this is the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/10528/">system of Thomas Thurston</a> , which predicted the <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/10654/">growth of Snapchat</a> , <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/245230/">Uber</a> , and Airbnb.  The simulation is so successful that Tom earns it with his help - in the firm Growth Science, which sells forecasts to large investors, and invests itself.  Another example is SigFig, which takes risks into account and uses algorithms to diversify investments. <br><br>  Automated advisors push out living professionals from the market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e3/f11/7b2/9e3f117b247f3dc939b504dd36a42b38.jpg" width="600" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365165/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365165/</a></p>
