    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  we: - Alex, is your official purpose of the visit to the RHS - promotion of AI8? <br>  AM: - well, drink, if possible. <br><br>  shergin: - Why won't AI8 support esvege? <br>  AM: ‚ÄúWe have been rewashing the whole engine for a year, this is already a big job, and you also want the eswege ...‚Äù <br>  shergin: - well, the opera does not break down to add eswege and rewrite a lot of code. <br>  AM: - well, then they are simply smarter than us :) <br><br>  munchhausen: - here you click everything on the camera ... <br>  AM: - yes, I enjoy photography (draws a non-microsoft business card with a link to the photo blog <a href="http://www.okewlus.com/">www.okewlus.com</a> ).  And my wife is professionally engaged in shooting interiors.  She even published some of my pictures in magazines. <br>  munch: Is this a profitable business in the states? <br>  AM: - perhaps not as profitable as programming in Microsoft :) Even if I worked half-time, I would get more than if I was engaged in photography all the time. <br><br>  munch: - what is your interesting lens. <br>  AM: - this is a lensbaby, a historical thing.  The first purchase in the world, made through the eighth Internet Explorer.  When he was still not finished writing. <br><br>  munch: - where are you staying in Moscow? <br>  AM: - My mother lives here. <br>  munch: - and how long have you been in the states? <br>  AM: - from the 92nd, as I got into Microsoft.  He went there with his wife, she is from St. Petersburg. <br>  munch: where did you study? <br>  AM: - I graduated from the Novosibirsk State.  the university. <br><br>  shergin: - how many people are approximately employed in the development of AI8? <br>  AM: - no one will tell you the exact numbers, I can only say that about the same, <br>  how many are busy developing firefox.  We have a lot of remote teams. <br>  Script engine, for example, is made in India (or China - I do not remember what it said - munch).  In our office, there are about 50-100 people in the main AI8 team. <br><br>  shergin: - What do you do as an architect most of the time? <br>  AM: - I invent something and try to do it, if it turns out - I give it further to the developer. <br><br>  we: - who designs you? <br>  AM: - in Boston, perhaps there is not a single designer who doesn‚Äôt have anything from Microsoft in the portfolio. <br>  we: - it is not referring to advertising, but to the design of Microsoft products, interfaces, etc. <br>  AM: - for this we have a special department, we do not outsource such things. <br><br>  we: - What is your version control system in the AI8 project? <br>  AM: - we bought Perforce and we customize it to fit our needs. <br><br>  munch: Do you have a lot of new friends during your stay in the states? <br>  AM: - Of non-Russians, only one person I can call a close friend.  He is black, but very Russian in spirit.  Still, it makes you know about yourself the difference of education, mentality, different cartoons that we watched in childhood, <br>  different culture, different songs that sang, different books that read, etc. <br>  In general, people treat me very well. <br>  For example, they love working with me.  I believe that I create a good working atmosphere in the team. <br>  I like to make cocktails and on Fridays I sometimes arrange a cocktail party for my colleagues. <br>  shergin: - at home? <br>  AM: - No, in the office.  In a special place where you can do it. <br><br>  In short a clear kid. <br>  It leaves the most positive impressions. <br><br>  UPD: boys, I understand everything, but why twist karma?  Shakes you something?  Or I offended anyone not in the case? <br>  UPD2: my respect to those who did not give twist) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/25035/">https://habr.com/ru/post/25035/</a></p>
