  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Mail.Ru will release a phone under its own brand</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Mail.Ru portal has announced plans to release a branded mobile phone with pre-installed software from Mail.Ru.  The project was called the working name of Meilofon.  The appearance of a new model on the market is planned in the first quarter of 2009. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The mailofon will combine a wide range of communication capabilities and high-speed mobile Internet access.  The device is equipped with two cameras, one of which is designed for video conferencing, GPS-navigator and WiFi-adapter, supports 3G networks, and is also equipped with a special software module that provides a continuous Internet connection in GSM networks. <br><br>  The name of the partner company Mail.Ru, which took over the creation of the hardware, is still kept secret, but it is known that it is one of the world's leading manufacturers of mobile phones.  The first 3D models and even prototypes of the future apparatus have already been created.  Currently, about $ 15 million has been invested in the project. <br><br>  The appearance of the mailofon, developed in collaboration with the designers of Kidrobot, a company specializing in the production of designer toys, will not leave users indifferent.  Each device will be accompanied by six ‚Äúskins‚Äù (interchangeable panels) of the original design, developed on the basis of studying the preferences of Blogogove@Mail.Ru users, who also have the opportunity to change the design of their diary on the web.

      In the future, clean do-it-yourself panels with special markers for painting will go on sale, and Mail.Ru users will have the opportunity to create their own author skins.  The company plans to hold competitions for the best replacement panel design among young designers. <br><br>  However, the main highlight of the new phone will not be an eccentric appearance, but a unique software developed by the company.  It, according to the creators, will combine the advantages of social networks on the Internet and cellular networks, allowing to determine the location of the object with an accuracy of 50 meters. <br><br>  One of the already known services is mobile dating, which will allow you to find an object that is suitable for the given parameters in the maximum geographical availability and literally go ‚Äúcloser‚Äù to it using a GPS navigator.  Mobile module for the social network MoyMir@Mail.Ru will not only find out the current location of close friends, but also carry out a geographical search of former friends by school, university, work colleagues and neighbors, with whom life has separated the user for a long time. <br><br>  The decision to create your own mobile device model was made in connection with the Mail.Ru course to maximize the ‚Äúmobilization‚Äù of portal services.  Currently, the mobile portal wap.mail.ru already has Mail, Search, social search service Answers, Videos, Blogs, Music, Poster, My World World Network, Dating, Weather, Horoscopes, Postcards, Chats and Games.  In addition, there is a mobile version of the program for instant messaging Mail.Ru Agent. <br><br>  Mail.Ru plans to support its loyal users: mobile network operators are negotiating preferential rates for users accessing the mobile services of the portal from Maillophone.  Perhaps at the initial stage of Mail.Ru, the full payment of mobile Internet traffic will go to users of its device. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe mailofon will probably become the first precedent in the Russian market when the company, initially focused on business on the Web, is working on creating a mobile device adapted to its services,‚Äù commented Mail.Ru CEO Dmitry Grishin.  With the release of the new device, Mail.Ru users will not only be able to be online regardless of their location, but will also receive an innovative device with unique functionality. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22720/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22720/</a></p>
