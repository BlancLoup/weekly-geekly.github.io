And I like constructive, so in this post I decided to highlight the program of the Ministry of Education and Science <a href="http://www.spbstu.ru/f2h/index.asp">‚Äú5 per 100‚Äù</a> , according to which <a href="http://www.spbstu.ru/news/2013_07_09/2013_07_09.asp">15 participating universities</a> have already been selected and which should lead to ‚Äúnot less than five Russian universities enter the first hundred of the world's leading by 2020 universities according to the world ranking of universities ".  So that the order of financing was clear: <b>in 2013 the</b> total budget of the project will amount to <a href="http://xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8/3503"><b>9 billion rubles</b></a> (that is, approximately 600 million rubles each for the participating university for this year, with the possibility of transferring the unspent amount to the next year).  The amounts are large, so I propose to jointly think about ways of effectively spending these funds - it is possible to promote / implement the most interesting proposals.

 <i>For example <a href="http://xn--80abucjiibhv9a.xn--p1ai/%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8/3503/%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BB/2381/13.07.07-%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D0%25A1%25D0%259F%25D0%25B1%25D0%2593%25D0%259F%25D0%25A3.pdf">SPbGPU application</a></i> <br>  The main indicators (2013 ‚Üí 2020): <br><ul><li>  <b>QS rating</b> (did not participate in the rating ‚Üí 97) <br></li><li>  Number of articles in the Web of Science and Scopus with the elimination of duplication on 1 <abbr title="scientific and teaching staff">NPR</abbr> (0.11 ‚Üí 0.2) <br></li><li>  The average citation rate for 1 <abbr title="scientific and teaching staff">NPW</abbr> , calculated on the basis of the articles counted in the Web of Science and Scopus databases, with the exception of their duplication (13 ‚Üí 20) <br></li><li>  The share of foreign professors, teachers and researchers in the number of academic staff, including Russian citizens who hold PhDs from foreign universities (1% ‚Üí 5%) <br></li><li>  The proportion of foreign students enrolled in the main educational programs of the university (considered taking into account students from CIS countries) (10.5% ‚Üí 15%) <br></li><li>  The average score of the Unified State Exam of high school students taken for full-time education at the expense of the federal budget for undergraduate programs and training programs (74 ‚Üí 78) <br></li><li>  The share of income from extrabudgetary sources in the structure of income of the university (47% ‚Üí 60%) <br></li></ul><br>  Additional indicators: <br><ul><li>  The annual volume of R &amp; D per 1 <abbr title="scientific and teaching staff">NPR</abbr> (0.35 million rubles. ‚Üí 1 million rubles.) <br></li><li>  The share of young professionals, teachers without uch.  degrees (up to 30 years old) and young scientists (Ph.D. - up to 35 years old, Ph.D. - up to 40 years old) in the total number of <abbr title="scientific and teaching staff">CPD</abbr> (19% ‚Üí 25%) <br></li><li>  Number of international RECs created in cooperation with international high-tech companies (14 ‚Üí 24) </li></ul><br><br>  Universities will not retreat from these indicators.  The most important indicator that will determine the fate of university managers, faculty members and the continuation of funding is a place in the ranking. <br><br><h3>  What is the motivation? </h3><br>  As I wrote at the beginning of the post, for 2013, 9 billion rubles were allocated.  In subsequent years, the allocated funds will depend on the revenue part of the budget of the Russian Federation, but most likely it will be no less sums. <br>  Why does the title include "catch-up game"?  Since  there is an understanding that not all universities will be able to pull out the declared programs and satisfy the conditions of the competition, therefore their part of the money will be released and redistributed to other universities participating in the program. <br>  At the end there will be only <strike>one</strike> five! <br><br><h3>  Who are the judges? </h3><br>  As an international rating for assessing universities, the <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings">QS</a> rating was chosen as the most acceptable.  It means that some ratings are very conservative, for example, in the Shanghai rating, as far as I understood, one of the important indicators is the number of nurtured and teaching Nobel laureates.  It is clear that such figures significantly increase by 2020 is almost unreal ... <br>  The QS rating will be updated on September 10 and in the new version we will see more Russian universities, incl.  <a href="http://spbstu.ru/">SPbGPU</a> . <br><br><h3>  What will universities do on this big money? </h3><br>  Since  competitive selection for the 5 in 100 program was held in a hurry, now the universities are given a little time to finalize their programs (based on indicators from competitive bids).  Therefore, at the moment there is an opportunity to make constructive suggestions: how can the allocated money be used to improve the quality of education and the research process in a single university, so that the rating indicators will increase. <br><br><h3>  Subtotal </h3><br><br>  In my opinion, the ‚Äú5 in 100‚Äù program seriously activates the competition of universities throughout Russia and contributes to the fact that our universities will be more quoted abroad.  A definite / <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART">SMART</a> long-term development guide and an <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D1%2583%25D0%25BB">incentive</a> for this development appeared, which is good news. <br><br>  On this, this excursion into the program "5 in 100" is over.  If you have questions - ready to answer in the comments.  And if there are specific ideas, how to ensure an increase in the above indicators in a single university, I will try to bring the most interesting ones to the management of my university and take them into consideration (specific idea = what + budget + which indicators improve).  Primarily interested in the ideas of the scientific part. <br><br>  PS It is a pity that you have to publish an article in inactive time.  I hope she still finds her interested reader. <br><br>  PPS Jokes on the topic ‚Äúalready thought of us without us,‚Äù ‚Äúall drank,‚Äù etc.  I ask to keep with me / save for another post.  Better advise more suitable hubs. <br><br>  UPD.  Thanks for the message in PM about broken links.  Corrected. <br><br>  UPD2 (09/10/13).  According to the published QS rating, St. Petersburg State Polytechnical University hit the Top500 universities ( <a href="http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2013">rated by Russia filter</a> , <a href="http://ria.ru/society/20130910/962077678.html">RIA Novosti</a> ). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/192476/">https://habr.com/ru/post/192476/</a></p>
