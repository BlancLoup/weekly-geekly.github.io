As it became <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/246778/">known</a> last March, the democratic candidate Mrs Clinton‚Äôs US presidential candidate for e-mail correspondence did not use her own mail server, but her own.  After it became clear that state secrets were also passing through an unprotected server, a remarkable scandal broke out, as a result of which Clinton became a figure in the investigation of a special Senate commission and was forced to give explanations to her careless actions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The story actually turned ugly.  Republicans insisted that in March 2015 the investigation fell into the hands of intelligence and as a result it became clear that Hillary Clinton‚Äôs server contained at least 1,200 letters with state secrets, however, whether they were made available to unauthorized persons.  Moreover, the content of the two letters turned out to be so serious that even a high-ranking intelligence officer Charles McCullough, head of the investigation, was forced to obtain special permission to view them, since the information in the letters had the highest privacy status - Special Access Program (SAP). <br><br>  Fox News <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/01/19/inspector-general-clinton-emails-had-intel-from-most-secretive-classified-programs.html">describes the</a> status of SAP as one that exceeds Top Secret, and access to it is determined by the need-to-know principle, since disclosing the content of such documents implies a significant risk to the source of information.  At the same time, no one knows exactly how many letters with SAP access were on the server, since the investigation deals only with randomly selected files.  McCullough says that the Secretary of State (at that time) Hillary Clinton could not understand what kind of secret information she was dealing with.

      Interestingly, in September last year, Edward Snowden <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/261932/">spoke</a> on the same topic, who, like no one, knows well the principles of the work of the secret services - he was in solidarity with the commission investigating the Clinton case.  "If ordinary State Department officials or the CIA ... sent out details about the embassy security system, which probably were in her [Hillary Clinton] letters, about personal meetings and conversations with government and foreign officials, such employees would not only have to lose their work, but, very likely, would have to be responsible for this before the law, ‚Äùhe noted. <br><br>  As a result, Hillary Clinton had to make public excuses.  She apologized to the members of the Democratic Party, because the proceedings could interfere with her presidential campaign, and explained that, in her opinion, she did not violate the protocol of working with secret correspondence, because at that time the letters were not secret.  Along the way, another curious circumstance became clear.  It turns out that the US Department of State has some difficulties with how to exchange secret information on the Internet, because, unlike the CIA, many officials do not have access to special secret postal services and are forced to use ordinary ones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/356988/">https://habr.com/ru/post/356988/</a></p>
