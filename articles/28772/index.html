  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We use social networks for personal gain</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Someone uses social media for communication, someone for entertainment, someone just has nothing to do. <br>  But there is another option - the use of social.  networks for selfish commercial purposes. <br>  A pair of case studies under the cut. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Example one is a search for people.</strong> <br>  Not so long ago, I was preparing to shoot a short video for an advertising agency site. <br>  In addition to questions about finding a studio with a chromakey, an operator, and all the other staff, the question arose of finding a girl of model appearance for shooting.  Familiar for this role is not suitable - not the type, but to look for a girl through the agency for such a low-budget project would be waste. <br>  And here, against the background of universal hysteria about social networks, it occurred to me to "try my luck" on the website of my classmates.  I think that almost everyone knows that on this portal there is such a graph as a ‚Äúplace of work‚Äù.  Without thinking twice, I create an account, go to the community, type in the search form the word ‚Äúmodel‚Äù, and voila - that's the result!

Well, let's go look! <br><br>  Click in the first available link. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/42f/b3a/456/42fb3a45661b9f3fadd4737e18ff32d4.jpg" width="300" height="219" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  And here are our girls. <br>  After reviewing more than two hundred questionnaires, selecting about 30 girls who are suitable for our survey, I make up a general text with a proposal for cooperation - a description of work, a budget, and a timeline.  I am sending a message and am waiting for a result that did not take long to wait - after 2 days we had already met with one of them and agreed to shoot. <br><br>  Total: <br>  1. 200 viewed profiles. <br>  2. 30 requests. <br>  3. 6 positive feedbacks. <br>  4. 1 girl invited to shoot. <br><br>  To say that the model fee was several times lower than if we worked through an agency, I think it is not worth it. <br><br>  Conclusion: <br>  Unusual use of familiar tools leads to positive results.  Do not be afraid to experiment! <br><br>  <strong>An example of the second is point communication with the target audience.</strong> <br>  Not so long ago, I worked in a marketing communications agency and led several PR projects. <br>  One of the projects was the communication support in the Internet of the economic conflict of a very famous Russian corporation.  The target audience, to which we needed to convey our opinion, is mainly political scientists, economists, insurers and lawyers. <br><br>  As part of the PR campaign, a non-standard course was invented, again using the notorious classmates. <br><br>  We developed a provocative image with which it was necessary to pinpoint people from our Central Asia. <br><br>  The scheme of work was similar to the previous case - in the ‚Äúplace of work‚Äù column we selected the companies of interest to us, a virtual character was created where our image stood on the place of avatar and our company specialist spent 2 days visiting to the employees of these companies.  Naturally, people were interested, firstly, in a non-standard avatar, and secondly, upon closer examination, it was understood what was depicted there.  As a result, in almost all the companies that we ‚Äúprocessed‚Äù in this way, our image reached the people we were interested in and even a few media outlets wrote a note about our course. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/152/629/4d5/1526294d5b44985a3de689132e514212.jpg" width="450" height="284" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Bottom line: with minimal cost, we conveyed our message to the Central Asia we are interested in and once again initiated the discussion of the conflict from the point of view we need. <br><br>  <strong>General conclusion.</strong> <br>  Even the usual rolling tools can sometimes be used very non-standardly, but very effectively.  The main thing is to understand the effectiveness of a specific tool and the possibility of using it to solve a specific task.  Simply put - no need to shoot a cannon at sparrows and vozdushka at elephants - you need to be able to calculate the effectiveness of a particular step, but at the same time not be afraid to experiment. <br><br>  Successes on all fronts! <br><br>  With respect. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28772/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28772/</a></p>
