The huge popularity of this rather difficult for an unprepared reader, the book has become a big and pleasant surprise for us. <br>  String theory claims that we live in a ten-dimensional Universe, but only four of these dimensions are accessible to human perception, the other six dimensions are collapsed into an amazing structure known as Calabi-Yau diversity.  Legendary Chinese mathematician Shintan Yau, one of the discoverers of these amazing spaces, argues that geometry is not only the basis of string theory, but also lies in the very nature of our Universe.  Reading this book, you and the authors repeat the exciting path of scientific discovery: from a crazy idea to a complete theory. <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://www.piter.com/book.phtml%3F978545900938">The book on piter.com</a> (now the next print run is over, the new one is in the print shop, you can do pre-order <a href="http://www.piter.com/book.phtml%3F978549600247">here</a> ) </li><li>  <a href="http://elementy.ru/bookclub/book/359/">The book on the site Elements</a> </li></ul><br>  Well, at the end of the publishing house <b>"Peter"</b> congratulates all readers of Habra on the upcoming New Year and once again reminds of his habr-gift - a <b>free e-book</b> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/piter/blog/162161/">¬´HTML5.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/piter/blog/162161/">Developer's Guide</a> .
