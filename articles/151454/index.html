  <section class="page js-page"><h1>3 sides of the coin or why the user is against automation</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Having worked a little in the field of introducing automation software, I began to increasingly encounter problems when the user simply changes his mind and no longer wants to automate his enterprise.  In this post I decided to consider the 3 most common reasons for refusals from automation (and of course I also want to know your opinion and will be happy with all comments). <br><img src="http://g2.delfi.ua/images/pix/file1450056_380500_pveq1m.jpeg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. <b>When the bosses are only FOR</b> !  The most common, as I see it, type of refusal is when the bosses are for automation and transparency in the affairs of the company, but employees are against.  In my opinion, in this case, the employees of the company simply do not want to open all the cards to the management, this is often the case with sales people.  In this case, of course, it is very convenient to keep the entire database of customers and correspondence with them, for example, in the mail.  Of course, the manager will not require a password or hack your mail to make sure how things are going with a particular client.  Naturally, such people are always trying to put pressure on their bosses, in order not to use automation programs or, say, conventional CRM. <br>  <b>Bottom line:</b> managers most often reject a proposal for automation due to the pressure of operating personnel. <br>  2. <b>Mercenaries!</b>  That's what I call all excuses like: ‚ÄúI was disappointed in the programs of this type‚Äù, ‚ÄúI prefer foreign analogues and I wait until the Russified versions come out‚Äù or what I like more ‚ÄúYou know, I watched many <a href="http://www.megaplan.ru/">Megaplan</a> types besides <a href="http://www.prostoy.ru/">your complex</a> , <a href="http://www.teamwox.com/ru">TeamWox</a> , <a href="http://www.terrasoft.ua/">Terrasoft</a> , <a href="http://www.amocrm.ru/">AmoCRM</a> and others, but never found what I need.  So I decided to hire programmers to write a special program for me. ‚Äù  No, well, are you serious ??  I do not understand such people, how long does it take to write something better than the listed programs?  In general, it is almost impossible to convince such people. <br>  <b>Bottom line:</b> 60% of such people abandon automation systems (it is likely that they return to programs or automation services after a certain time). <br>  3. <b>We are lazy!</b>  Such cases appear less and less often, but they still exist.  When you just work and train a few weeks user, already with him on ‚Äúyou‚Äù and just like old friends, a brilliant phrase is born from his mouth: ‚ÄúI realized that all this is difficult, I will not automate my enterprise‚Äù.  Brilliant!  I do not argue that at first it is not so easy, because before you start work, you need to build a chain of how everything will work in the program, terrible tortures and torture await users only at the beginning, then as it should be, the work will go on.  Maybe I, of course, do not know something, but is it possible to build the whole chain from order management to customer bases and accounts in a program in a couple of hours? <br>  <b>Bottom line:</b> As often happens, most users return to working with the program.  This is approximately 50-60% of all these cases. <br>  That briefly described everything that disturbed my mind.  As for me, automation programs are very useful, the convenience of transparency of work saved me more than once when I needed to see what you did, say, a year ago or with which client you worked and what the result was.  Still, it is better, even in case of failure, to read the boss‚Äôs curse in the comments, than to listen to everything alive, and keep your nerves both yours and others. </div>
