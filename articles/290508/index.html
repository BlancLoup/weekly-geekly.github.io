  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lead generation as an alternative way to monetize a site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello! <br>  For those of you who are engaged or planning to develop media resources, Oleg Khriyenko continues to share tips on their monetization.  This time it will be about lead generation. <br><br>  You can design a site for several years, sharpen it under a media or context, and then still come to the conclusion that all the work done was not worth the effort.  On the resource, advertisers do not want to be placed even under the conditions of a preliminary test period, and contextual advertising brings in not enough money to recoup the costs invested in the content.  But after all the traffic is still there and this is not schoolchildren.  Maybe there is still an opportunity to increase the income of a resource without even greater investments in its processing and development? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The lead selling model (applications for the services of potential advertisers) comes to the rescue.  Simplified, it looks like this: you host some kind of creative, which encourages the participant to make an appointment / get advice / call the window measurer, etc.  People leave a request for the service, the advertiser processes it, and you are paid some kind of fixed reward. <br><br>  If you possess at least minimal common sense, you can easily turn your resource into a lead collection machine. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <h4>  We determine our capabilities </h4><br>  Carefully review your resource again.  Write down all the pages of the project that have at least some constant traffic and try to answer the question - what services may be most in demand by your readers. <br><br>  As an example: <br><ul><li>  Article about problems with appearance -&gt; cosmetology or plastic surgery </li><li>  Legislation and legal advice -&gt; paid legal advice </li><li>  Old wooden windows -&gt; installation of glass packages / restoration of windows </li><li>  Pregnancy Symptoms -&gt; gynecologist consultation </li><li>  Engine problems -&gt; auto workshop </li><li>  Sick gums -&gt; dentistry </li><li>  List of drug treatment centers -&gt; services of a narcologist </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/677/f3a/493/677f3a493cea454392007956cde8a1e2.png"><br><br>  Next, you need to carefully analyze the failure rate of each article.  Given these data, identify the number of potential customers for each service, based on a conversion of 1% <br><br><h4>  Pricing </h4><br>  After we have decided on our potential, it is necessary to understand the prices and understand how much all this is profitable.  Write the average check in front of each of the services.  Decide whether the service is a one-time service, or whether the person will apply for it again and again.  The higher the average check and the more frequent the repeatability, the higher the possible price on your part. <br><br>  Register the maximum (within reason, so that on the other side the potential advertiser does not immediately hang up) and the minimum price for himself.  This is, firstly, your benchmark for bargaining, secondly, will give you the opportunity to calculate your income <br><br><h4>  Fines and Landings </h4><br>  We now turn to the most difficult - the mechanics of lead generation.  It is worth saying how not to get leads: <br><ol><li>  With banners </li><li>  With links in the text leading to the landing page </li><li>  With the help of special news from the editorial board with recommendations of a service. </li></ol><br>  Your main competitor is the context.  You can not use the same mechanisms as in contextual advertising, and rely on great returns.  The advantage of lead generation on your side lies in the fact that you can use non-standard advertising inventory, which will give a result higher than the standard scheme with an ad in contextual advertising, leading to the landing page. <br><br>  <i>This does not mean that you should not make a landing too and buy ads in context.</i>  <i>If you have agreed on a decent amount with the advertiser and feel the gift of an arbitrator in yourself, why not try?</i> <br><br>  Here are a few rules according to which you must act: <br><ul><li>  The service offer must be intrusive </li><li>  A person should not immediately understand what is being offered to him.  Play on the paternalistic dream of most Internet users about the Internet as a stock of free services and advice </li><li>  At the end of the way, reveal the cards and tell them what the user will get (unless they have already agreed with the advertiser on the low quality of the leads) </li><li>  Constantly hint at the advantages of a professional approach against solving a problem on your own (you can treat your teeth with folk remedies for a long time, but still it‚Äôs better to go to the dentist if you don‚Äôt plan to soon become a new icon of punk movement) </li></ul><br>  Do not be afraid to copy or immediately reject the decisions of competitors.  The best lead generation mechanism is the one on which you would ‚Äúlead‚Äù yourself. <br>  Good examples of lead collection scenarios: <br><ol><li>  Widget with the offer of a free consultation from a doctor on a medical site.  After the user enters his question in the online chat, the robot doctor reports that, unfortunately, this question cannot be resolved online and offers to make an appointment at his clinic out of turn. </li><li>  In articles about protein diets, an extensive block is inserted with an ‚Äúexpert opinion‚Äù about the possible consequences of this diet.  The person who uses this method for weight loss, after reading, finds symptoms in himself and wants to find out what he should do.  At the end of the article, our expert urges not to self-medicate, but to immediately fill out an application and get advice in his nutrition center on how to lose weight and not kill health. </li><li>  The insertion of comments from the ‚Äúexperts‚Äù into the articles with the proposal to immediately sign up for this service expert (button with the text ‚ÄúSign up for a consultation.‚Äù) </li></ol><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/489/dd8/fe1/489dd8fe192748579002f252e5ab62e7.png"><br><br>  It is worth considering that lead generation does not harm contextual or display advertising, therefore, you do not need to think about possible losses when changing the priority source of income. <br><br><h4>  We are looking for an advertiser and work with him </h4><br>  After you have prepared and tested the script, understood your potential and decided on the list of services - it is time to find a potential advertiser.  Do not be afraid to tell him about their methods.  On the contrary, he should know them in order to optimally receive applications on his side. <br><br>  It is worth considering that the applications work best while they are ‚Äúhot‚Äù.  That is, if the advertiser cannot immediately respond to the application, it is better not to even start working with it, because there will be eternal debates about the quality of the leads. <br><br>  The process of selling itself is extremely simple.  You find a potential advertiser, offer him free testing for a week and connect him to your lead collection system.  If all your predictions and tests turned out to be true, the advertiser will get good leads and after bargaining will agree to work with you on a reimbursable basis. <br><br>  In principle, ‚Äúhappy end‚Äù, however, may not happen if you do not take into account the following points: <br><ul><li>  Lida need to filter.  Do not allow spam and substandard applications on your part (it is best to manually filter through freelancers) </li><li> Lida must be controlled both on the side of the advertiser and on his side.  The advertiser must be able to access the list of leads on your server if he has a failure in the account on his side </li><li>  You need to negotiate exactly on the application, rather than on actual customers (do not take responsibility for the work of someone else's sales department) </li><li>  Advise the advertiser how to increase the return on your leads, help to customize their work and the work of sales managers. </li></ul><br><br>  Actually, that's all!  Good luck in monetizing sites! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290508/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290508/</a></p>
