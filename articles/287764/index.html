  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review blogs ‚Ññ47. In the blogging world</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://crazyhamster.livejournal.com/197568.html">crazyhamster.livejournal.com/197568.html</a> <br><br>  <strong>Special offer: buy two copies of "Computer News" for the price of two!</strong> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong>You took a pigeon by the wings and thrust a three-liter into the can ...</strong> <br>  She died down, played, sounded the <a href="http://content.tut.by/">ceremony of awarding the</a> best content projects, and I just have my fate written to express my opinion on the occasion.  Let's start with the fact that the blog contenders for victory was surprisingly small - only 15 pieces.  Perhaps the ignorance of the Belarusian bloggers about the contest played a role.  I myself feel guilty about this, so it turned out that the release of the blog review, which spoke about the possibility of submitting applications for the competition, appeared on the last day of the contestants' admission.  And many bloggers, even learning about the contest, could no longer participate in it.  We continue by expressing our bewilderment about the winners in the nomination ‚ÄúBlogs‚Äù.  I am not going to dispute the first place of the " <a href="http://www.seobaby.net/">Lady in Search</a> " - a charming, but at the same time "in the subject" blog.  I would give the first place to others, for example, to myself, but, thank God, nobody called me on the jury.  But the second place ‚Äú <a href="http://blog.blog.tut.xn--by14-cqa5329b/">Blog about Belarusian blogs and bloggers</a> ‚Äù for me personally looks strange.  As well as the fact that the third was not given to anyone.  Alexey Skalaban, the author of ‚ÄúBlog about ...‚Äù, already occupied the second place last year in the same nomination with his project ‚Äú <a href="http://inf.by/library">Librarians of Belarus: Library Blog</a> ‚Äù.  No, I do not mind for the namesake of another prize, and I am not jealous of him for what he also writes about blogs.  It just seems to me that ‚ÄúBlog about ...‚Äù is actually not a blog.  This is such a news site, but not a blog.  It‚Äôs just that TUT.BY needs to advertise its own services, and Alexey‚Äôs blog just happened to be placed on a blog service not yet launched (by the way, surprisingly) from a megaportal.  That is, the organizers kill several birds with one stone - the prizes, it seems, are distributed, but remain in the family.  And this can be said about other nominations.  Although I never condemn TUT.BY.  If ‚ÄúComputer News‚Äù held a competition for the best IT journalist in Belarus and did not leave all the prizes in the editorial office - there would be no limit to my surprise.  My only regret is that other, as it seems to me, more worthy blogs have not been marked.  And in general, compared to other nominations, ‚ÄúBlogs‚Äù looked somehow rather poor.  I really wanted to talk about all this disgrace with both Alexei Skalaban, and Artyom Gerasimovich (a member of the jury, who just fooled blogs), and Alexander Oakley, but could not attend the afterparty (which for some reason was called a banquet), and during the ceremony they were allowed only to yawn, and not to talk through crawling.  However, we are trying to discuss this topic in <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/belblogs">Google Groups</a> and I ask you to also join our debate.  And by postscriptum I want to worry about the statement of Yuri Ziser that, in his opinion, all these social networks and Web 2.0 are a soap bubble and do not represent anything significant.  True, he later added that his colleagues did not share this opinion.  I hope that soon Kirill Voloshin and Sasha Chekan will overthrow the manager, sharpen him at the dacha somewhere near Myadel, and lead TUT.BY to the full and final Web 2.0 themselves!  Well, or at least Web 2.1.

      <strong>I will smile like a Buddha ...</strong> <br>  The next paragraph I will dedicate to moaning over the reproduction of blog services by budding all over the Bynet.  Soon Belarus will be ahead of the rest of the world in the number of services for maintaining and creating your own blogs per capita.  What for?  How are people going to return funds invested in it?  There are already at least four purely Belarusian projects, so the fifth one arrived in time - <a href="http://byjournal.com/">byjournal.com</a> .  Above the <a href="http://www.bybanner.com/article/4575.html">press release</a> about the discovery of byjournal.com, even my cat Waffle laughed.  Just look at the original features offered to us by the new service: ‚Äú <em>Writing to a blog is not easy, but very simple! Just enter the text in a special field and click a button. All your notes will be sorted by the date they were published. You can use RSS to display updates on the blog and comments</em> "And so on ... If it had appeared at least four years ago, we would all breathe together:" Wow! "- and crouched in a respectful curtsy.  However, today you won‚Äôt be surprised by the WordPress engine, and you won‚Äôt be lured to yourself by transferring banal functions.  Taking this opportunity, I want to appeal from the pages of the newspaper with a request to all Belarusian developers who are going to launch another blog service for the masses in the near future: ‚ÄúIf you are so unbearable, then make a clone of some fresh start-up, which so far has only one thing, Yes, and that in English.  And forget about blogs, there are already very, very, very many of them.  Please, I beg you! ‚Äù. <br><br>  And now about the good.  About a good blog - <a href="http://www.ui.by/">www.ui.by.</a>  Belarusian blog about various IT-trivia and usefulness.  And the blog is collective, at the moment there are three people in the authors, but, as I understand it, the authors are not limited by anything.  There are not many notes yet, but judging by the start, there are a lot of interesting things ahead of us.  Yes, and now you can read some interesting articles, for example, " <a href="http//www.ui.by/2007/04/03/user-interface-evaluation-by-non-experts/">Evaluation of the user interface by non-specialists</a> ."  Honestly, it's nice to find projects that were created not just ‚Äúwe had a blog anyway‚Äù, but with a soul. <br><br>  <strong>Watch yourself, be careful ...</strong> <br>  In the United States, a " <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6540385.stm">blogger code</a> " has been developed, setting self-censorship on the web.  From now on, according to the author of the initiative, users should independently abandon the use of offensive language, slander and even respect the copyright and the right to privacy.  The blogger‚Äôs codex was developed by network old-timers Tim O'Reilly.  To the realization of this idea he was pushed by a harassment with threats, unleashed on blogs with respect to programmer Katie Sierra.  The woman was even forced to close her blog and abandon the network communication.  Sierra spoke in detail about the abuses she had experienced from ‚Äúmorally flawed‚Äù network users.  The affected issue has highlighted from the new side the eternal philosophical question about the degree of human freedom.  Now this first ‚Äúcode of laws‚Äù for the online community should be evaluated by other bloggers who can even make proofreading to it.  The same rules apply to attempts to spread libel on blogs, as well as materials that violate copyrights or the right to privacy.  However, the Codex bloggers themselves caused a double reaction.  In particular, opponents of this initiative explain their position by the fact that the presence of a special freedom in the blogosphere is its main difference.  In the end, this is not a school library and not the media in the usual sense. <br><br>  PR Partner PR agency was the first in the history of Russian PR to offer its customers to use a new tool - the press release 2.0 - when working with the media.  In press releases of version 2.0, in addition to company news, which forms the basis of the message, journalists receive concentrated information from several independent sources on the topic of the release.  Publications are provided not only a look at the news message from within the company, but also the views of other market participants.  In addition to the "body" of the news and already boring quotes from company representatives, the press release 2.0 from the PR agency PR Partner contains such sections as links to recent media reports on the topic, links to corporate blogs and podcasts, to the online community of the company's clients.  There is an element of interactivity in the new press releases - the opportunity to ask the speaker through the Internet, links to his biography and a photo on the corporate website - <a href="http://b2blogger.com/pressroom/release/1882.html">b2bloger.com</a> reports.  Even if you do not pay attention to the pretentious "first in history", the fact and trends are quite remarkable - the ideas of Web 2.0 are beginning to be applied in everyday life, they become clear not only computer freaks, but also ordinary business people.  It is very interesting, what can end up from such a symbiosis. <br><br>  <strong>Lesha Kaletsky</strong> <br><br>  <a href="http://kv.by/index2007150602.htm">Published in "Computer News" (‚Ññ15, 2007)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/287764/">https://habr.com/ru/post/287764/</a></p>
