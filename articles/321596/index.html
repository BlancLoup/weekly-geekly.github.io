Dmitry Tsimoshko, director of information technology at Century 21</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fd/492/19a/4fd49219aa074b2eb46c13283c46921a.png" width="300" align="left">  We continue to ask specialists about the mode of work and rest, professional habits, the tools they use, and much more. <br><br>  It will be interesting to find out what unites them, in what they contradict each other.  Perhaps their answers will help to identify some general patterns, useful tips that will help many of us. <br><br>  Today our guest is Dmitry Tsimoshko, director of information security of the international network of real estate agencies <a href="https://www.century21.ru/">Century 21</a> .  He has been working in IT for about 10 years.  He has taken a career path from an ordinary IT specialist to the director of a large division in an international company.  Dmitry is currently subordinate to more than 10 people - system administrators, developers, programmers, layout designers.  Information technology has been keen on since childhood. <a name="habracut"></a>

      <b>What do you do in the company?</b> <br><br>  I plan and distribute tasks among subordinates, control their implementation.  In emergency situations (a CRM system has departed, the site does not work), we promptly react and solve problems within an hour.  Another important task is to increase the base of counterparties that help to solve IT problems.  At the moment, there are about two hundred such partner companies. <br><br>  <b>One word that best describes how you work:</b> <br><br>  Only forward (smiles). <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you spend on work?</b> <br><br>  10 hours. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  7 o'clock. <br><br>  <b>How do you have breakfast?</b> <br><br>  I love to have a hearty breakfast.  These are mainly proteins - beans, meat, fish. <br><br>  <b>What are you doing on the way to / from work?</b> <br><br>  Outside of work, I also work most often: calling and texting on business issues. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  "Bitrix24".  I‚Äôm not happy with him, but this is the least awkward todo manager we‚Äôve tested in the company. <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can't you do without?</b> <br><br>  Google services are the most flexible and allow you to edit documents with the whole team.  In general, Google - the leader in online services, in my opinion. <br><br>  <b>What kind of task manager / issue tracker / repository do you use in the company?</b> <br><br>  Depending on the task, this is Bitrix24, a Google spreadsheet or a tasker inside a CRM system. <br><br>  <b>What other tools and software do you use at work?</b> <br><br>  We use Windows, there is no need for other software yet. <br><br>  <b>Does the company have internal projects?</b> <br><br>  We have several projects - telephony, unloading system.  We also developed a geo-positioning system, in Russia there are practically no analogues.  This is a service that allows you to determine the geolocation of both Russian and foreign addresses.  Our real estate agent logs in and selects the location of the object.  The service is updated automatically. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when you work?</b> <br><br>  When distracted by non-working issues, especially during discussions. <br><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  I will especially highlight a few books that I read at various times - Scrum, Agile, Deadline, ‚ÄúFrom Urgent to Important‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to feed cats‚Äù.  I recommend this literature to colleagues from the top echelon of programmers. <br><br>  <b>What do you prefer: electronic reading rooms or paper books?</b> <br><br>  Nothing replaces paper books. <br><br>  <b>What technique and why do you prefer at work and at home?</b> <br><br>  Laptops due to flexibility and availability.  I have several at home and at work.  The brand is absolutely not important. <br><br>  <b>What do you listen when you work?</b> <br><br>  Your colleagues (smiles). <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  Note from the back of the monitor "busy" (smiles). <br><br>  <b>What kind of professional advice for the future can you give yourself?</b> <br><br>  Laying unforeseen risks while planning, not forgetting at the right time the need to refactor projects and always have a plan B in large projects with a high degree of uncertainty. <br><br>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  The most important thing is to create a team that suits you, fulfills the business requirements, participates in the analysis of the problem, asks questions and offers solutions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/321596/">https://habr.com/ru/post/321596/</a></p>
