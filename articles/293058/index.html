Some business owners, having given up the task to an outsourt, act according to the principle ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù.  And they remember contractors only when the time comes for the monthly report.  Unfortunately, SEO doesn't work that way.  Search promotion gives the result only if the advertiser and the agency act as a coordinated team.  It becomes effective when the customer is ready to accept the recommendations of specialists, to implement them in time, without disrupting the deadlines.

      <br>
      Here are some of the most common mistakes that customers make when contacting an agency for search engine optimization. <br><br>  1. Breaking deadlines.  The customer implements the recommendations of the optimizer within six months with a minimum period of one month.  At the same time, the issuance of search engines often changes and how quickly the recommendations will be implemented depends on whether the site improves or worsens its position in the top. <br>  2. There is no perfection in the world.  The client refuses to implement the recommendations on the site, because he is confident in his ideality.  Unfortunately, this is often not true. <br>  3. Reluctance to listen to professionals.  The customer does not implement the recommendations of the optimizers, because he is sure that he knows better how to help the development of the site.  In this case, the question remains: why was it wasting money and time on an SEO agency? <br><br>  Having dealt with the errors, let's consider the example of four cases, what results can be achieved if the optimizer worked professionally, and the client listened and executed all the recommendations of the agency. <br><br>  <b>Case ‚Ññ1: Young people everywhere we have the way</b> <br><br>  Young sites are not easy to get in the list of responses of search engines to the user's request.  For example, the TOP-10 topics "taxi service" includes mastodons, the age of the domain of which varies from 3 to 10 years.  Taking a place in the TOP in this case is also hampered by the policy of search engines.  This can be seen in the example of Yandex, which, according to most popular requests, issues primarily its own services, for example, Yandex.Taxi or Yandex.Market.  They are traditionally occupied by the first lines of search results and no other resource can reach them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/241/b81/d2d/241b81d2d43c48b6b76a888cff233531.jpg"><br><br>  However, all is not so hopeless.  The task of ‚Äútaking out of the darkness‚Äù of search queries a young taxi service site seemed to us somewhat ambitious.  We started with the fact that they began to gradually increase the reference mass in order for the resource to be highly ranked by search engines.  Reference mass is a collection of all external links placed on third-party resources and leading to the site being optimized.  It is an important factor in ranking search engines: the more links, the higher may be the position of our "ward".  By the way, the old sites pay attention to this factor is not necessary, since the volume of their reference mass and so large. <br><br>  Also, when promoting the site, we took into account the seasonality of search queries - this helps to maintain traffic and high conversion at any time of the year.  It is a mistake to assume that users, for example, in the spring and summer request the same thing.  In the spring, they can search the search engines for "taxi", "order a taxi" or "a taxi in Moscow."  And in the summer, when the holiday season begins, the query ‚Äúa taxi to the airport‚Äù becomes more popular.  Tracking changes in search queries and strengthening the most popular ones in time is an important moment in work.  Otherwise, it turns out that, for example, in the spring the client‚Äôs site is at its best, as attention was paid to seasonality.  And with the arrival of summer, if time does not strengthen the requests corresponding to this time of year, the position of the resource decreases. <br><br>  The work brought results - for 12 months, the website of the taxi service was visited 16 times more often than before the promotion. <br><br>  <b>Case ‚Ññ2: User requests as a category of goods</b> <br><br>  Compliance with the requests of users in search engines is the "pledge of health" of any promoted site.  For example, a person writes in the search box: ‚Äúbuy a red bicycle‚Äù.  If there are a lot of such requests, then this is an important signal for action for the optimizer, which deals with the online store selling bicycles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ad/b8f/449/0adb8f449e734a6793c19111f95f45a5.jpg"><br><br>  In our case, it was an online brick store.  It was in accordance with the requests of users that the sections of the site were named: ‚ÄúHand-molded bricks‚Äù, ‚ÄúFacade tiles‚Äú under brick ‚Äù,‚Äú Tools for cleaning bricks ‚Äù.  And in the names of goods - included the names of sections, for example, "Facing brick Markinsky brown 1NF" from the category "Facing brick". <br><br>  In addition, commercial ranking factors were introduced for all products ‚Äî indicators characterizing the reliability of the online seller: product price, payment options, delivery information, assortment, contacts.  As a result, the attendance of the resource for the year of promotion has increased by more than 6 times. <br><br>  <b>Case ‚Ññ3: Quantity is not an indicator of quality</b> <br><br>  Some business owners mistakenly believe that the main thing in website promotion is to take a place higher in the search engines.  In fact, it is not.  Of course, the first position, for example, in Yandex, speaks about the status of a business, but for the optimizer it is more important to first bring visitors to the client‚Äôs site, who will later become buyers, and only then raise the resource. <br><br>  When the site of elite kitchen interiors turned to the agency, we began by defining its target audience.  It is pointless to drive a crowd of users to a similar resource - having seen on it kitchens for 200-300 thousand rubles, they are unlikely to buy them.  Therefore, instead of working on traffic, we focused on conversion, that is, we tried to turn the maximum number of site visitors into buyers. <br><br>  After the client began to receive orders, we started to work on raising the status, using for this ‚Äúhigh-frequency‚Äù and ‚Äúmid-frequency‚Äù requests - that is, those that are most often set by users in the search process.  They do not give much traffic, but raise the site in the TOP.  As a result, the business received both customers and online status: one of the top 3 Yandex on the main key requests. <br><br>  <b>Case ‚Ññ4: Ponaheli</b> <br><br>  Earlier, Moscow agencies promoted the sites of their clients, both in the capital and in other cities, if the companies had representative offices there.  They simply tied to the address and telephone number of the office optimized for Moscow TOP, for example, in Samara, and due to this they occupied high places in the local TOP.  As a result, the regional search engines were filled with Moscow companies, whose budgets at this level are extremely difficult to kill. <br><br>  We initially went the other way.  Our client, a company selling ventilation systems from Nizhny Novgorod, has representative offices in different cities.  But for him it was important to promote the site in the TOP of his native region.  Therefore, we acted with the exact opposite: we optimized the Internet resource, first for Nizhny Novgorod, and only then for other cities, including Moscow. <br><br>  Already in the first 11 months of work, the attendance of the client‚Äôs site increased almost 12 times.  And here also Yandex carried out the reform, changing the rules of geolocation of each specific site.  As a result, Moscow companies can no longer use the same resource for promotion in several regions.  They have to create a separate website for each city, in the TOP of which they want to get.  We also found the changes to be the same: TOP Nizhny Novgorod was cleared of capital companies, with the result that the client received a greater amount of search traffic. <br><br>  Thus, a well-coordinated teamwork of the client and the agency and the joint definition of the goals of search engine optimization helps to bring the site to the top search engines, helps to increase the conversion rate and, consequently, increase the number of sales and orders. <br><br>  Author: Evgeny Moiseev - Co-founder of Kokoc Group </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293058/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293058/</a></p>
