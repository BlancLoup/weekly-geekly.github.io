      The fact is that just the other day, the ‚ÄúHappy Farmer‚Äù, the most popular on the Vkontakte social network, simply changed the design and demonstrated new game models.  Regular customers of the game did not like these changes.  Moreover, this resulted in a stream of endless battle, according to eyewitnesses, in a frank mate towards the owners on the official forum of the company.  Special activists have created their own VKontakte groups, such as ‚ÄúWe will return the Old Happy Farmer‚Äù, in which they urge to massively remove the game application from their pages.  The number of which in a few days has grown to several thousand members.  The decoration of the groups resembles the wall of a military campus, with posters and slogans, chronicling events ... But all this would remain a child's play if it were not for the money invested by people.  It turns out that some very avid players spend up to 5,000 rubles a month!  (according to the participants themselves).  In our country, in the outback, people live on such a salary ... The amounts spent on the purchase of services are quite large, however, as the dissatisfied people themselves found out, in fact, they are not obliged to do anything in return for the money spent!  Actually, you can change the order of service tomorrow, and the money spent today will go into void. <br><br>  Having rummaged around the net, I discovered that similar events had already unfolded about a year ago, when furious SF users tried to judge and even called for the physical destruction of the creators of the game.  The reason then was the "reset" game accounts.  What led to the actual financial losses of players who invest a considerable amount in the purchase of services. <br><br>  Recently, it has become fashionable to pursue pirates, bribe officials, police officers, in the end.  But for some reason, they close their eyes to the fact that spheres are ripening and developing, which were not taken seriously before.  They already earn big money, but are not responsible for the product and services.  And oddly enough, despite the "ephemeral" virtual product, casual users already consider it as a direct damage to property. <br><br>  Perhaps, there will be people more knowledgeable in such questions who will give a more concrete assessment of the specific situation and the situation as a whole?  What are the obligations of a person taking sms for "supermetla" in an online game? <br><br>  PS I read the comments, and I understand that I made a mistake by making a strong emphasis on Farmer.  Nevertheless, I will clarify and add - I wanted to say that in our life (if not personally in your life, but in the lives of others), the virtual more and more often takes on the character of the real.  I can make the same requirements for an e-cow bought for SMS, as for a live one bought on the rural market (with certificates and vaccinations).  As said in one famous film: ‚ÄúWhat is reality?‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/87608/">https://habr.com/ru/post/87608/</a></p>
