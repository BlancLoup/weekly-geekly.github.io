It is enough to compare the indicators of the "dialers" that we all used just a few years ago, and it will become clear - there is a catastrophically low standard day.  Manufacturers have a different approach to solving the issue.  Someone focuses on energy-saving technologies in the "hardware", others allow you to discolor the screen, turning a new smartphone into something like an e-book.  In turn, the current flagship of the <b>Highscreen</b> lineup offers our attention the simplest and most reliable way to stay in touch - a high-capacity battery.  Let's see what else can serve as a competitive advantage of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/789/23f/dc9/78923fdc903b4042ab1b358588116ac8.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Unlike Ice 2, Zera U received a box of standard ‚Äúindustrial‚Äù cardboard, which schematically shows the internal structure of the smartphone.  Such packaging is familiar on most Highscreen models, and in times of total savings, vendors pay attention only to the atypically large dimensions of the container for the device.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36d/8d6/197/36d8d619739c4814a700c462d5f985f8.jpg"><br><br>  It turns out that the manufacturer put in the kit not only the phone itself, a set of necessary documentation and a charger (5 V, 1 A).  At your disposal as many as two batteries!  The capacity of the main one is 2000 mAh, and the additional one is as much as 4000 mAh.  Due to the fact that the thickness of the batteries is almost doubled, each of them has its own back cover.  In addition, while the smartphone is used with one battery, the second can be charged in the complete docking station, which is very convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/848/b9e/ffe/848b9effe4cd4847925f51d16c431e37.jpg"><br><br>  The use of high-capacity batteries predictably affects the weight and size characteristics.  A modest 8.8 mm is converted to 13.5, and the weight of the device increases from 135 to 185 grams.  The length and width of the device do not undergo any changes - all the same 133.9 x 70 mm.  According to this indicator, Zera U can be recorded in almost standard five-inch smartphones along with Google Nexus 5. The screen area is 79% of the front surface, protected by third-generation Corning Gorilla Glass. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa7/4e0/069/fa74e006982c45e7bb2669ae0acbff38.jpg"><br><br>  Moreover, the glass covers not only the display, but the entire front part of the device, creating associations with devices on the now forgotten OS MeeGo (Nokia N9).  No logos, unnecessary elements, and even more buttons - a smooth black surface, only occasionally broken by the blinking of the light indicator, signaling the missed notifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/734/652/1e1/7346521e15804a8a840d448a208331d7.jpg"><br><br>  Standard Android OS controls are implemented in the form of touch buttons that are removed by pressing a small shortcut on the right side of the panel.  The hardware power key and the volume rocker are located on opposite sides and are equally convenient for both left-handers and right-handers - there are no complaints about the ergonomics of the solution.  Is that the headphone jacks and charging for some reason located on the upper end and very close, but we rarely listen to music while charging the device, is not it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/995/890/0ad/9958900ad0cd4631a55f9df49bab4e7f.jpg"><br><br>  The front phone is just sleek and very practical due to high-quality oleophobic coating.  If you switch to the consideration of complete rear covers, then it is impossible not to pay tribute to the pragmatism of engineers.  The ‚Äúback‚Äù is made of matte plastic with a soft-touch coating, which completely eliminates the chance of dropping the device from your hands, even in the version with a high-capacity battery. <br><br>  In short, despite the inconspicuous color scheme, the Zera U came out distinctive and comfortable, and the tightly knit body and good build quality make it possible not to worry about backlashes even with regular replacement of batteries. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/716/f82/200/716f8220089f432bab4839ae7c01aa3d.jpg"><br><br>  The main consumer of electricity, as you might guess, is the display.  Full HDD-matrix with a high pixel density (441 ppi) is made by IPS OGS technology and has excellent viewing angles.  In addition, there is no air gap between the glass and the display, due to which the image is clearly distinguishable even on a bright sunny day. <br><br>  Another noteworthy feature of iron is the Wolfson WM8918 chip, which significantly improves the quality of music playback in headphones.  You can also count on the ringing speaker, but you can experience a truly clear and rich sound by plugging in your headphones or headset.  At the same time will become available and listening to FM-radio. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0c/7f0/9c4/a0c7f09c4f7c453e92c5e813a2f507f4.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/653/74b/da1/65374bda193d47348a2b9678c6ace0af.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b73/c03/242/b73c032429974061a5b1d27c60e22efb.png"><br><br>  The software device is not corrupted by any shells, we have a clean Android 4.4.2 KitKat.  Is that in the sound settings you can find and turn on the "improvers" BesAudioEnh and BesLoudness, and the screen properties contain the item ClearMotion, aimed at improving the smoothness of the picture. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/673/31e/603/67331e6031e146e1a135e36c951ea702.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e85/ec1/e9b/e85ec1e9b2d5413591f120dd6f988882.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9a5/6f3/61f/9a56f361fc824e0694114bc67c06f130.png"><br><br>  Regarding the upgrade to Lollipop, so far nothing is known, but the status of the flagship of the family imposes certain obligations, so there is hope. <br><br>  The performance of the smartphone is provided by an overclocked eight-core MediaTek MT6592T processor running at 2.0 GHz in conjunction with 2 GB of RAM and a Mali-450MP4 graphics accelerator.  Due to the lack of ‚Äúbells and whistles‚Äù in the interface, it‚Äôs a sin to complain about performance - you can easily enjoy any fresh games, whether Asphalt 8 or Dead Trigger 2. Of course, there are no lags in the system interface, windows and screens switch instantly.  A few words about all your favorite stability - for all the time of use, the device has never hung up and rebooted of its own accord. <br><br>  For connoisseurs of benchmarks, we did tests in several popular programs, the results are available in screenshots.  In addition, in Epic Citadel, the device went out at 52 frames per second with a working resolution of 1800x1080 in the ‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù mode. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/344/52f/ccc/34452fcccd2848a5bda1c1c339e07827.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a1/4fa/b4b/1a14fab4b34545c0a7128a13e0983c8f.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/771/10c/2c9/77110c2c9d2a4ca0b06fcd3c3bc887fb.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1e8/d92/9fe/1e8d929fe9dd4715bd8fa5f976ad0263.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d2c/a74/4cc/d2ca744cc88940f09067ba08d7f7a7c6.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5af/077/01e/5af07701e196414d9513d8bda5e2310a.png"><br><br>  Games and programs can be put on both 16 GB of internal memory (the user can use about 11.5 GB) and on a supported microSDHC card.  After spending a few minutes of your time, you also get 128 GB in the popular cloud storage 4Sync, so you can not worry about storage space. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ac/d7e/e33/8acd7ee3357b4e169cfc37dfb1bdddee.jpg"><br><br>  A little about the most important thing - the telephone functions.  At your disposal are two slots for SIM-cards, and one of them is the microSIM form factor.  The radio module in the device is one, so both SIM cards can work simultaneously only in standby mode.  The distribution of responsibilities between the cards is implemented by standard means, and you can always choose which operator to use for calls, and which for data transfer over 3G or text messaging. <br><br>  The interlocutor is heard well, problems with setting up the connection are also not noticed.  Due to the widespread use of smooth glass, rolling on the side faces of the device, you can keep the phone near your ear without fear of scratches and irritation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2c/fbf/3a9/f2cfbf3a9957425589e6c29c8d32685d.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7b6/8db/705/7b68db7052a548508f89eb0acde03102.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b4b/1ac/74e/b4b1ac74e27c43d39b3725ebe7a90716.png"><br><br>  In addition to supporting voice communication and data transmission over 3G, Zera U has a standard set of interfaces for communication with the outside world: Bluetooth 4.0 + EDR, Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, GPS (with A-GPS support) and USB-OTG .  The latter allows you to connect external storage media (flash drives and hard drives), view and transfer data if necessary. <br><br>  In the meantime, there is no data, it is worth creating them, and for this we turn to the built-in camera.  In a compact version, it is somewhat issued from the body, and when using an extended battery, you can not worry about the safety of the lens - it does not appear at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b28/fe9/ed8/b28fe9ed8c334c91b9dd3578ab415074.jpg"><br><br>  In the presence of a module of 13 MP and a front camera of two megapixels of resolution.  The interface looks standard and is supplemented by a mode selection carousel.  The button to activate the HDR mode is taken out separately, which is good news.  Most of the pictures from the phone will surely be taken in the ‚Äúautomaton‚Äù, but for those who want to delve into the settings there is freedom - there is a set of scenes (portrait, landscape, sunset, etc.), as well as ISO settings, white balance and other characteristics (sharpness, saturation) that can significantly affect the final image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72f/c79/69c/72fc7969c1124e8ea0bc326b17ed3eb5.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/967/45f/ba9/96745fba9355442a8201d7a628483bfc.png"><br><br>  Not forgotten and simple filters (sepia, negative and others), along with support for geo-tagging.  Of course, the device can shoot panoramas, but this is not limited to this.  Scrolling through the available modes, you will find ‚Äúlive photos‚Äù, followed by a short video recording, and even the implementation of a three-dimensional image of a single object taken at different angles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a8/404/f9c/3a8404f9c344475f901f616f4bd60723.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/382/1c1/394/3821c13944c9424aa7989ec262146d3a.png"><br><br>  However, the most in demand in the spring will probably be HDR mode, and a separate button here is very helpful.  Generating a photo with an extended dynamic range does not take much time, but it is desirable that the objects in the frame do not move, otherwise there is a risk of getting a double image.  Another handy little thing about working with the camera - the activation of the shutter voice according to the word ‚ÄúCapture‚Äù or ‚ÄúCheese‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a58/a58/7c3/a58a587c371049059094c84941bc61e0.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/011/6e9/fe0/0116e9fe049148cf8192009d9846248b.png"><br><br>  Video device writes with a resolution of 1920x1080.  The resolution of the clips received from the front camera - 640x480.  Auto focusing and adjusting the exposure when shooting video work, but the white balance is better to choose in advance if you decide to shoot indoors. <br><br>  Below are examples of photos taken by the device in various conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb6/1ab/48b/fb61ab48b82c4a7d9fb8b7fc96a2946a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df4/248/892/df424889283245178b871a44939c705c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/727/0d4/67d/7270d467d47244afbe17d5464ff06d6d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e87/efd/eac/e87efdeac8504c35a20a0fbee6e90a21.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/840/c01/49d/840c0149d5bc4c28b31d37d4e3355af4.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/841/754/9a1/8417549a18f748619ee1463901f78c42.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06d/716/feb/06d716feb5a14b2d8d9434de6ac90e75.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/270/cf7/5c5/270cf75c58734c65824436fa63cae97a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b6/96f/3f6/9b696f3f6f7149bf885bc7d22eb2a29d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a1/036/864/1a10368646914b1facd4723f64767952.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f33/320/5d9/f333205d99bd4808aca24f3cf1f18a66.jpg"><br><br>  Original photo on <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/612o6idx50ihay4/AABkLyyNSk7ce7JZlp55CxF1a%3Fdl%3D0">Dropbox</a> <br><br>  Pictures from the front camera: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1d4/0d7/872/1d40d7872f4d4a939462e538c676e676.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/265/53e/974/26553e97436d4154ac0cd25c266cfac6.jpg"><br><br>  Whatever it was, resources are needed for any activity, and in our case it is a banal battery capacity.  How does the device, allowing to change the power supply ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù?  It is clear that with 2000 mAh in the presence of FullHD-display and a powerful processor you should not build the illusions of eternal life.  One day of moderate load, up to three hours of the screen turned on, and the device will be asked to charge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdc/2a6/f72/bdc2a6f72888448bbab28e48880147e3.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d47/022/340/d470223407e14d65b1d195cf728309fe.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fcb/b59/e1c/fcbb59e1c6cf44e09e00047b4fa505ad.png"><br><br>  Quite another thing - twice the large capacity.  Here boldly count on a couple of days of battery life, which is especially valuable for travelers and all others who need to stay in touch.  In the end, a free battery can always be charged while you are using the device for its intended purpose, and at the right moment it will help you out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/861/171/a08/861171a080bf4977960910e7d73fb37a.jpg"><br><br>  Zera U will certainly be of interest to those who appreciate a practical and well-adjusted approach on the principle of ‚Äúnothing superfluous‚Äù.  The standard interface of the Android OS, which does not require habituation, convenient controls, good sound and reasonable modularity - what else do you need from the device for every day? <br><br>  The recommended retail price for <a href="http://shop.highscreen.ru/catalog/smartfony/highscreen-zera-u/">Highscreen Zera U</a> is 18,990 rubles. <br><br>  Technical characteristics of Highscreen Zera U <br><br>  ‚óè OS: Android 4.4.2 (KitKat) <br>  ‚óè CPU: 8-core, 2.0 GHz, MediaTek MT6592T <br>  ‚óè GPU: Mali-450 MP4,700 MHz <br>  ‚óè RAM: 2 GB <br>  ‚óè Memory for data storage: 16 GB, slot for memory cards microSDHC (up to 32 GB), 128 GB of cloud storage 4Sync <br>  ‚óè Screen: touch, multitouch, IPS OGS, 5 '', Full HD (1920x1080), 441 ppi, glass Corning Gorilla Glass 3 <br>  ‚óè Cameras: main - 13 MP, autofocus, flash;  frontal - 2 MP <br>  ‚óè Network: GSM / GPRS / EDGE, UMTS / HSPA + <br>  ‚óè SIM cards: 2 (microSIM / SIM) <br>  ‚óè Interfaces: Bluetooth 4.0 + EDR, Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, USB-OTG <br>  ‚óè Navigation: GPS, A-GPS <br>  ‚óè Radio: FM tuner <br>  ‚óè Sensors: accelerometer, light and proximity sensors, magnetic field sensor <br>  ‚óè Batteries: removable, lithium-ion, 2,000 mA * h (3.7 V; 7.4 Wh * h) or 4,000 mA * h (3.8 V; 15.2 Wh * h) <br>  ‚óè Dimensions: 133.9 x 70x8.8 / 13.5 mm (thickness at 2 000/4 000 mA * h) <br>  ‚óè Weight: 135/185 g (at 2,000/4 000 mA * h) <br><br>  Delivery set of Highscreen Zera U <br><br>  ‚óè Smartphone <br>  ‚óè Instruction <br>  ‚óè Stereo headset <br>  ‚óè Micro USB cable <br>  ‚óè USB adapter for 220V network <br>  ‚óè Additional cover <br>  ‚óè Docking station <br>  ‚óè Two batteries </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374959/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374959/</a></p>
