  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Cloud Connect Chicago 2012 - Day Two</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi Habr! <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed3/fed/c6a/ed3fedc6a9bbc02aa6185acac784e435.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br><br>  In a previous <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/151224/">article,</a> I said that the <a href="http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/chicago">Cloud Connect</a> conference had begun in Chicago.  Judging by the reviews, the Koffer itself is quite interesting for the public, so I will try to lay out what I learned and understood.  So‚Ä¶ <br><br><h5>  Second day </h5><br>  From eight in the morning breakfast began and what we call networking.  People meet up, people communicate, tell each other their expectations, plans - this is very interesting.  Since  on the second day, the real reports were already appointed, and not just the seminars, there were much more people in the lobby, which could not but please.  <i>The report will be pictures, sorry for their quality ...</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h6>  Cloud Security Threats, Challenges, and Landscape </h6><br>  At 8:30, I went to a report on <a href="http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/chicago/cloud-computing-conference/cloud-security-and-risk.php%3Fsession_id%3D11"><b>Cloud Security Threats, Challenges, and Landscape</b></a> .  The report was conducted by <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/pete-lindstrom/1/105/676">Pete Lindstrom</a> and told everything that was possible in the clouds in safety.  We reviewed the main topics: <br><ul><li>  How can I easily translate the application to the clouds </li><li>  What are the risks of cloud computing? </li><li>  How we can improve cloud application security </li></ul><br>  What you need to pay attention to in the security issue: <br><ul><li>  Cloud risks </li><li>  Cloud architecture </li><li>  Application Threats </li><li>  Application Vulnerabilities </li></ul><br>  What increases the risks? <br><ul><li>  adding users </li><li>  adding administrators </li><li>  adding open ports </li><li>  adding new applications / services to the system </li></ul><br>  You should also pay attention to reducing the cost of attacks (for example, if the software has become popular, it has become cheaper to break it - many people are doing this).  Increasing the rights of users in the system also significantly affects the risks.

      What lowers the risks? <br><ul><li>  deleting users </li><li>  closing ports </li><li>  deleting administrators </li><li>  stop applications / services in the system </li></ul><br>  Increasing the cost of attacks and revising the rights of users in the system are also very important for reducing risks. <br><br>  It was told a lot about all sorts of user cases and possible options for protecting applications in the clouds.  It looked like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/40e/9d9/7d0/40e9d97d0b29649963ff8dab6a6dd82f.jpg"><br><br><h6>  Tuesday keynote </h6><br>  After the first series of reports, a long session of <a href="http://www.cloudconnectevent.com/chicago/cloud-computing-conference/keynotes.php">Tuesday Keynote began</a> - very, sometimes not very interesting people spoke, mostly heads of companies and leading experts in the field of cloud technologies.  They talked about their experience in building clouds (Google, Rackspace) and about the directions that their companies will develop in the near future. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/71f/e96/c79/71fe96c79c9cb78934f9691e9b3a2087.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h6>  EXPO </h6><br>  At the exhibition, I talked to the Racksapce traders.  I know a lot about them and used their OpenStack, so the conversation did not have a consulting character. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ddf/04a/046/ddf04a046144b710b2d98e6fde49dc38.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Stand EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL was sad and the consultant even during the conversation stuck into your iPhone and reluctant to answer questions <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/53d/efa/82c/53defa82c0be29d7c014d5a1fe7817b0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Compuware - the company engaged in performance tests and optimization had a gorgeous booth and very friendly and active consultants.  Prior to this, one of their representatives was leading at yesterday‚Äôs seminar; this made it possible to easily communicate with the guys and ask them some questions that interest me about performance testing. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f9/886/c13/7f9886c13da51fc053d245d9109917fc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Datanational company, which deals with the DR procedure for everything, received a question from me, which they promised to answer tomorrow.  ‚ÄúHow easy and simple is it to make Oracle RDS DRs in another region?‚Äù Was my question.  This is really a pain in ass for many people.  In general, I doubt that they are in the subject. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/dab/1c2/f02/dab1c2f0253f7284ab36fe324dc911dc.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  One of the discoveries for me was the company Zadara.  They provide a very interesting service - fast drives for AWS EC2 interns.  Next to the Amozon data center in the EAST region, they have a cluster of SSD drives that provides 5k + iops via iSCSI or nfs.  True, interesting ?! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e3d/575/9fc/e3d5759fce9c13b58e6f0a5dd6717474.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h6>  Beyond EBS </h6><br>  Dave Wright told a story about how AWS outstripped its competitors by several years, creating and implementing EBS technology.  The evolution of EBS was shown: <br><img src="http://image.quickblox.com/f8b6f622b241cc876b5eb3166275.injoit.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The rest of the industry is 3-5 years away from EBS and looks like this: <br><img src="http://image.quickblox.com/4326262efab635cb49d3ee37d4a3.injoit.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Much has been told about the effectiveness of data warehousing, and of course advertising their product - storage based on flash drives. <br><br><h6>  Automating Cloud Applications Using Open Source </h6><br>  The guys from BrightTag told ‚ÄúSuccess Story‚Äù about how they created a product to manage resources in the clouds.  And the band cloud is absolutely unimportant. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8c5/747/fa1/8c5747fa11738bbec36f775da793dd8e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Their software can manage resources anywhere, is especially important for private clouds, where sometimes there are no concepts of auto-scaling and a load balancer.  The guys write OpenSource to earn money on: <br><img src="http://image.quickblox.com/842e6c840730026581a1219b7e5f.injoit.png" alt="image"><br><br><h6>  Afterword </h6><br>  The second day of the conference was more interesting: presentations, kinotes and an exhibition ... But, of course, it seems the most important thing that can be expected from this event is networking.  There are a lot of people here who have no idea about the clouds and came to listen and find out what it is.  When you have already eaten a dog on the most distinguished cloud technologies, a little can surprise you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/151368/">https://habr.com/ru/post/151368/</a></p>
