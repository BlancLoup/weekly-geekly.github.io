For some reason he thanked for this post, he also noted that he has no interest in the personal lives of other people, despite the fact that this is written in the news.  Although it is recognized that he joked with friends using samopisny spyware.  It has nothing to do with antivirus, it has already stopped its development and support. <br>  The technical side could not be discussed due to the language barrier, the only thing that he told me was that there is a server (php, ajax, js), on the server Muskul is a client written on the dotnet, the project development stage is alpha.  He did not answer questions about the situation with work due to NAT and about the protocol.  But he gave a link to the video where you can see the work of the program. <br>  <a href="http://vimeo.com/28194023">vimeo.com/28194023</a> <br><br>  With the help of good people <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/isden/" class="user_link">isden</a> and <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/users/merlin-vrn/" class="user_link">merlin-vrn</a> , who helped me with questions, I spoke in more detail with Rufat and with his consent publish our correspondence: <br><blockquote>  Okey.  I am using .NET for Windows client.  Browser control (server) is PHP, AJAX, JS <br>  We are developing this project.  And dont add now security methods. <br>  This project is not a hacker tool. <br>  This project client software notify connected PC.

According to the news portal mir24.tv, a schoolboy from Baku named Rufat Mammadov created ‚Äúa unique program, which has no analogues in the world‚Äù.  With the help of this program, it will be possible to control any computer, anywhere in the world with just a telephone <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/070/3b0/d96/0703b0d96bc6d2f127d8db515fbc59e2.jpg" alt="Program"><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúAny person using the phone can turn on an unlimited number of computers and ask them different commands.  In this case, the distance does not matter.  Even for a thousand kilometers you can control a computer or track its work. ‚Äù </blockquote>  Rufat Mammadli <br><br>  It is also reported that the American communication company has already become interested in the young talent and its program, and not only became interested, but immediately signed a contract for a year. <br><br>  As for prices, it is known that access to 5 PCs or less will not cost anything, from 5 to 50 PCs - $ 4.99 per month, and an unlimited data plan will cost $ 699 per year. <br><br>  Original news: <a href="http://mir24.tv/news/hi-tech/8263764">mir24.tv/news/hi-tech/8263764</a> <br>  There you can see a video report. <br><br>  The site shown in the report is here: <a href="http://loupse.com/">loupse.com</a> <br>  What's interesting is that any user can easily log in and manage two computers at once: one of them is in Berlin and the other in Dubai.  Unfortunately, there is no feedback and no one knows what is happening with these computers.  But of course, we all understand that this is just a stub, and not a hoax. <br><br>  <b>upd.</b> <br>  Just now paid attention.  Look at the ip. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/deb/268/7f9/deb2687f936c883b13fc6107a90827b7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>upd.</b> <br>  The site ‚Äúfixed‚Äù and now the control panel, as well as registration, are no longer available.  A direct link is issued 404, when you try to access through the navigation menu - an alert "under construction". <br><br>  <b>upd.</b>  In the course of the search, it turned out that that ‚ÄúAmerican communication company‚Äù was the venture investor of Exoventure Associates.  An agreement was signed with Rufat and his associate from the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus. <br>  <a href="http://news.lent.az/news/140881">news.lent.az/news/140881</a> <br>  And earlier it was reported that our heroes won third place at the IX International Olympiad in ICT, held in Turkey, for the Quick Check program, which allows you to "control a computer from a distance." <br>  <a href="http://www.infocity.az/%3Fp%3D5366">www.infocity.az/?p=5366</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.ebiko.org/Kazananlar.aspx%3Fp%3D209">www.ebiko.org/Kazananlar.aspx?p=209</a> <br><br>  <b>upd.</b> <br>  I contacted Rufat and we will try to clarify how the situation really is. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/198244/">https://habr.com/ru/post/198244/</a></p>
