Last week, masks-shows burst into the Kharkiv company Zfort with all the consequences: no one was released, the director was taken away, and so on. <br><br>  Unfortunately, masks-shows, by themselves, in Ukraine are no longer out of the ordinary.  Everyone understands that this is one of the ways to earn money <s>for the New Year's children for gifts</s> .  In particular, some companies even give instructions on how to behave in such a case.  And I would very much like this to be the end of this place, but no. <br><br>  Today there was an official letter to the director of the company Zfort describing the situation. <a name="habracut"></a>  Looking ahead, please read this letter, if possible, detached.

    <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">I quote it as a quote.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><blockquote>  <i>Hello!</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I must say, I am aware of all the idiocy that is now happening in the company.</i>  <i>Unfortunately, things went worse than you could imagine.</i>  <i>And I understand that I am obliged to inform you about what is happening.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Many of you personally know me, and I hope for many years of work with you I have earned your trust.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I will briefly outline a picture of affairs.</i>  <i>The company is a banal raider seizure.</i>  <i>Nothing new and surprising in our reality.</i>  <i>The company has been growing by 40% per year for the last 3 years, and this is very attractive for these people.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Of course, they do not understand, and will not be able to understand that the main thing in the company is people.</i>  <i>This is a community of developers, managers, and customers, and to try to influence it by force is absurd.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The run was very well organized and planned.</i>  <i>They had a floor plan, my photo from Skype, and many other data.</i>  <i>During the search there was a huge number of violations, I was under serious psychological pressure, not allowed to contact anyone, including a lawyer.</i>  <i>But this was not enough - drugs were thrown at me (well, not a corpse :)).</i>  <i>Because of this, I had to urgently leave Kharkiv because of the threat of detention for the time this issue was resolved.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But these guys are just performers.</i>  <i>There is a customer, part of you saw him.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>They demand from me a simple one - to redistribute shares in the company without my consent.</i>  <i>Only after that promise to remove the criminal case.</i>  <i>Then there will be a meeting of the founders - and they will deprive me of the post of director.</i>  <i>Then there will be an audit over the past years of activity, and new criminal cases will be ready for me - after all, the ‚Äúright‚Äù people will do the audit.</i>  <i>Everything is very simple and "legal."</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I know that the new management has already entered the company and distributes its instructions.</i>  <i>This woman is my wife, whom I divorced.</i>  <i>It is in collusion with the "customer", and they both benefit from a raider seizure, this is a kind of revenge on me.</i>  <i>Already yesterday, she signed the act of my absence from work in order to take advantage of herself.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>It is very sad, but it went over to the side of the raiders.</i>  <i>I already know that he was promised the post of director.</i>  <i>As they say, ‚Äúin our time it‚Äôs time to betray, it‚Äôs not to betray, but to foresee‚Äù (c) c / f Garage.</i>  <i>I ask you not to listen to his explanations on the situation, as he fully obeys the raiders and is financially interested.</i>  <i>Nevertheless, he is a very experienced manager and his instructions on project management must be listened to.</i>  <i>I will give an assessment of his personal qualities upon returning to Kharkov.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>The same woman put pressure on% First Name Last Name 2%, including threats in the last two weeks.</i>  <i>I ask everyone to support him as much as possible.</i>  <i>I wonder, in the future, if someone, for example, decides to leave the company, will they also throw drugs and threaten him to stay?</i>  <i>I will do everything so that such a guide never appears in our company.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In spite of everything, I really ask everyone to remain calm and continue working.</i>  <i>For some reason, I believe that this guide as it came in and will fly out like a cork from a bottle in the near future.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>I want to thank everyone for the support and collaboration that was provided last Wednesday.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Support me in the comments!</i>  <i>By the way, if this post is removed from the blog, it will be indicative.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>Thank!</i> </blockquote></div></div><br>  For my part, I want to say that my colleagues and I thought on this example on how realistic it really is to squeeze out the IT business of 300 people.  It turns out that if this is an outsourcing company that has many small customers, then everything can be.  It all depends on how well the end teams are integrated with their customers.  The better integrated, the less their work will be disturbed. <br><br>  Moreover, it will not be possible to take and leave everyone from work at the same time.  If several hundred people leave, then the IT-labor market will become sharply saturated with the corresponding consequences.  And because of their inertia, not everyone decides to take such a step.  This is not to mention the psychological (well, if only this) pressure on such employees. <br><br>  And if in this particular case the business is pressed, it turns out that no one is insured? <br><br>  <b>UPD:</b> After the post was published, a variety of comments started to flow to me about the fact that everything is not as simple as it seems.  And the letter can be another level of manipulation of public opinion.  For the time being, it is difficult for me to give any objective comments on this issue, I will cite below just one more link with a discussion of some past events of the company at the Kharkiv Forum. <br><br>  Therefore, to all who are interested, I advise you to familiarize yourself with the events personally (videos, twitter, forum) and form your opinion, which I don‚Äôt want to influence in any way. <br><br>  <b>UPD2:</b> Having collected some additional information, incl.  and from insiders, it turns out this.  The current director, apparently, never was the owner of the company.  And it seems like, initially the company belonged specifically to his wife.  And everything that happens is the result of home fights.  It's dull enough, isn't it?  It is especially unpleasant to attract law enforcement agencies to the current situation instead of a peaceful settlement of the problem, if there is one. <br><br>  It is completely incomprehensible how to deal with this all.  Therefore, just in case, I decided to remove the names / surnames from the citation letter, so as not to form an accidental misconception about people. <br><br>  <b>UPD3:</b> A more detailed analysis shows that we are not talking about raider seizure (in the classic sense of the word).  There is no third party to whom the business suddenly begins to belong.  More, the situation is similar to not dividing a business with rather rough and ugly methods.  Regular employees continue to work in the same mode.  What happens at the same time in top management can only be speculated.  On the sim and you can disperse. <br><br>  What conclusions can be drawn from this? <br>  1. Regardless of how it all ends, the company's image for the coming years is very badly damaged.  What is sad. <br>  2. There is still no need to worry about the IT sphere in terms of raiding.  There is no full precedent. <br><br><hr><br>  Company in Habr√©: <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/zfort" class="company_link">Zfort Group</a> <br>  Administrative profile of the company in Habr√©: <a href="https://geektimes.ru/users/alexzfort/" class="user_link">alexzfort</a> <br>  <a href="http://forum.mediaport.ua/read.php%3F5,926367,927031">The letter itself (repost) and some chronology of events</a> <br>  <a href="https://twitter.com/search/realtime%3Fq%3D%2523ZFort">Chronology of events on Twitter</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGLjtmZBjoYg">Video masks show part one</a> <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DIhakkESZ4kA">and part two</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.kharkovforum.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D2714660">Discussion at Kharkiv Forum</a> <a href="http://www.kharkovforum.com/showthread.php%3Ft%3D910568">and more (2010y year)</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160441/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160441/</a></p>
