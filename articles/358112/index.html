These tasks are set to "implement the breakthrough scientific, technological and socio-economic development of the Russian Federation, increase the population of the country, increase the living standards of citizens, create comfortable conditions for their living, as well as conditions and opportunities for self-realization and discovering the talent of each person." <br><br>  Among the tasks, some are related to science and technology industry.  In particular, the authorities have once again sent an order <b>to switch to domestic software</b> .  There is good news for scientists.  For example, it is planned to create an advanced infrastructure for research and development, innovation activities, including the creation and development of a <b>network of unique scientific installations of the megasysans class</b> .  In addition, Vladimir Putin is demanding "to ensure the attractiveness of work in the Russian Federation for Russian and foreign leading scientists and promising young researchers." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Among other things, until 2024, the government is obliged to achieve the following goals: <br><br><ul><li>  Acceleration of the technological development of the Russian Federation, an increase in the number of organizations implementing technological innovations, up to 50% of their total number.  (Note: the share of organizations implementing technological innovations in Russia was: in 2012 - 9.1%, in 2014 - 8.8%, in 2016 - 7.3%, <a href="http://www.gks.ru/free_doc/new_site/business/nauka/pril4/11.xls">source</a> ). </li><li>  Providing accelerated introduction of digital technologies in the economy and social sphere. </li></ul><br>  By October 1, 2018, the government should develop (adjust) national projects (programs) in 12 areas, including on science and the digital economy.

      When developing a national program, the government should ensure: <br><br><ul><li>  the presence of the Russian Federation among the five leading countries in the world in research and development; </li><li>  the attractiveness of working in the Russian Federation for Russian and foreign leading scientists and young researchers; </li><li>  A faster increase in R &amp; D costs from all sources compared to a country's GDP growth. </li></ul><br>  The government must ensure the creation of an advanced research and development infrastructure within a six-year period. <br><br>  To stimulate innovation, it is planned to create and develop a network of unique scientific installations of the ‚Äúmegasiens‚Äù class. <br><br>  At least 50% of the instrumental base of leading R &amp; D organizations, the creation of world-class research centers, including a network of international mathematical centers and genomic research centers, and the creation of at least 15 world-class scientific and educational centers based on the integration of universities and scientific organizations and their cooperation are planned. with organizations operating in the real economy <br><br>  According to the national program ‚ÄúDigital Economy of the Russian Federation‚Äù, the government should ensure the achievement of the following goals and targets in 2024: <br><br><ul><li>  an increase in domestic spending on the development of the digital economy from all sources (by share in the gross domestic product of the country) by no less than three times compared with 2017; </li><li>  the creation of a sustainable and secure information and telecommunications infrastructure for high-speed transmission, processing and storage of large amounts of data that is accessible to all organizations and households; </li><li>  <b>the use of primarily domestic software by government agencies, local governments and organizations.</b> </li></ul><br>  To this end, Russia will create a system of legal regulation of the digital economy, introduce civilian circulation based on digital technologies.  It is planned to create a global competitive infrastructure for transferring, processing and storing data primarily based on domestic developments, ensuring information security based on domestic developments in transferring, processing and storing data, as well as creating end-to-end digital technologies primarily based on domestic developments. <br><br>  In addition, for the draft national road construction program, the government should ensure the following task: <br><br><ul><li>  introduction of automated and robotized technologies of traffic management and control over the observance of traffic rules; </li></ul><br>  Thus, science and the digital economy are listed among the priorities for the development of the country for the next six years.  In addition, the world's leading scientists are planned to move to Russia.  Apparently, they will work on projects "megasiens". <br><br><blockquote>  <b>Note:</b> When commenting on this material, please follow the rules of Habrahabr.
