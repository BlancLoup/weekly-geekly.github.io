You have developed a couple of mobile applications and even put one of them in the AppStore.  Now you want to develop your ideas, take your knowledge to the next level and build a real product that people will use and love.  You want to create your own company. <br><br>  Creating your own company and products requires you to have knowledge and conduct activities in a variety of business areas, including: marketing, UX / UI, development, finance, and more.  Entrepreneurs, who have years of experience in creating companies, say that they still learn something new every day.  Obviously, you cannot immediately become an expert in all these areas.  You will need tremendous patience and perseverance to learn over the years.  You will gain experience only when you try again and again (and again!) To achieve the goal.

      However, there are things that could help you accelerate your learning and make the process of creating your own company and product development much more efficient.  I would like to give you four tips based on my own experience - something that I should have known myself before starting work on start-ups, corporations, creating my own products and companies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  1. Find yourself a great tutor. </h4><br>  I think that this is the most important and most important piece of advice that I could give to everyone (regardless of whether you are 19 or 59), who begins his entrepreneurial path.  On the way, you will meet with a huge number of questions, you will know various difficulties and dilemmas.  The best way to cope with them is to ask the advice of someone who has already encountered similar situations.  You will have a lot of questions: when to launch a product, what features to add, how to talk to investors and what to focus on. <br><br>  I would not advise you to try to get money from investors and patrons.  Try to get advice and feedback from entrepreneurs, investors and people involved in marketing.  Build relationships with them, and in the end you will find a personal mentor for yourself.  The one who has already passed this way, who has done what you have to do.  Mentor, to whom you could freely contact and ask questions.  Someone who would help you walk the path to entrepreneurship, who believes in you and your ideas. <br><br><h4>  2. Build relationships. </h4><br>  To succeed and explore your industry, get more knowledge about your products and most importantly about your customers, you need to build strong relationships with people who care and who share your interests and aspirations.  Attend web development and mobile application development, marketing, development, UX design and entrepreneurship workshops.  Get involved in communities like <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a> and <a href="http://growthhackers.com/">GrowthHackers</a> .  Meet people there, cooperate!  Do not be afraid to ask questions and write comments.  Participate in hackathons!  You can go there alone and meet new people there or go with friends. <br><br>  I managed two events for young entrepreneurs, and I was pleasantly amazed at how much they learn, how they find friends, what great products they create.  One of the events is called <a href="http://hackgeny.com/">Hacking Generation Y.</a>  This is a hackathon for young entrepreneurs.  Such meetings are very popular, and you may find these hackathons not far from you, but I am sure that other similar events are held in your area.  They provide an excellent opportunity to meet people who could be your future co-founders, mentors.  In addition, thanks to such meetings, you can create your own ideas and products, share them with people who could give you real feedback, help you learn and create something worthwhile.  Another event called <a href="http://mobilechallengejunior.com/">Mobile Challenge Junior</a> will be held in six locations around the world (I will be the head of the Tel Aviv hackathon). <br><br><h4>  3. Do not stop creating and experimenting. </h4><br>  Another tip that I could give to anyone who creates products: keep working, keep building.  Creating a product is like conducting an experiment or a series of independent experiments.  You need to define a goal or assumptions about what exactly you would like to learn from this experiment, implement it, and then analyze and continue.  If you continue this cycle of creating things and analyzing them, then you will understand that creating products is something in which you can become better, and thanks to this, your creations will constantly improve. <br><br>  When I talk about creating products, I don‚Äôt mean only the development of an application or the creation of a company website.  It can be anything related to your business.  For example, your blog post, Facebook, Twitter ads, or even a meeting with a potential user or investor.  Continue to make changes, approach the ideal through new cycles in your code and development.  And always be ready to learn and improve not only your product, but also yourself and your team. <br><br><h4>  4. Read <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">The Lean Startup</a> book by Eric Ries. </h4><br>  Frankly, I love to read.  I read mostly literature on psychology and business, but I learned about the book of Eric even before I started creating products and building my own company.  This is a source of knowledge, to which I return every day to make certain decisions regarding product and business.  I believe that every ambitious entrepreneur, regardless of age, should read this book. <br><br>  Do not forget that creating a business and a product is an adventure.  This is a long road with victories and defeats.  Be prepared for the fact that she will bring excitement, anger, smiles, tears.  It's like a roller coaster, so take your best friends with you.  It will be incredibly interesting.  In any case, you will be happy that you decided to ride.  Most people wind up new circles, repeating it again and again. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293710/</a></p>
