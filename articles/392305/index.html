  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In New Jersey, they propose planting zombies with phones for 15 days.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In 2012, seventy-eight thousand pedestrians were injured in the United States, and every tenth of them were injured because of a telephone.  From 2004 to 2010, the total number of accidents involving pedestrians distracted by phones increased threefold. <br><br>  Smartphones can bring to the hospital.  And last week in New Jersey a bill was proposed, according to which pedestrians staring at smartphones would be planted for 15 days and fined $ 50. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2c1/eb5/fc9/2c1eb5fc99b140a0ddbe9506529dae01.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the Chinese city of Chongqing, in order to protect the health of smartphone users and other people, they organized a special lane like a bicycle.  Only people with phones often do not pay attention to the markup.  In Utah, people who write something in smartphones on the move have been <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/story/2012-05-15/texting-while-walking-illegal/54979480/1">fined $ 50</a> since 2012.

From 2009 to 2013, the number of victims increased by 15% to 4,735 people.  If we talk about injuries - about two million pedestrians got them because of the phones. <br><br>  According to the Safe Kids Worldwide survey, about 40% of all adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18 said that they were either shot down or almost hit by cars, cyclists, or motorcyclists.  At the same time, 47% of them listened to music, 20% spoke on the telephone and 18% wrote something. <br><br>  People who are distracted by the phone, more often than others ignore the traffic lights and forget to look around at the transition. <br><br>  Not only drivers with a phone in their hands are dangerous.  The same rule applies to pedestrians.  That is why such <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/246292/">"walking dead" are</a> offered to scare with new laws in order to protect their own life and health. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> <br>  In February 2015, more than 1600 people took part in a survey on Geektimes on the use of a smartphone at crossings and during walking.  14% crossed the road with a smartphone in their hands, and 53% used a smartphone while walking.  Below are the same two questions again.  I propose to see how our behavior has changed over the past year. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/392305/">https://habr.com/ru/post/392305/</a></p>
