  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Programming Philosophy 3 - Chichikov and Programmer</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Where did you find the philosophy of Donald Knut?  The academic community is 20 crazy scientists, 2,000 Chichikovs, 20,000 bureaucrats and a million children.  The whip is Chichikov.  In the west, even a mad scientist knows how to be a media person; in our country it is ‚Äúvulnerable people, we must be very careful with them, in the best sense of the word.‚Äù  Can not connect two words, are offended by the questions.  Therefore, in our science only Chichikovs are visible, they distribute and receive awards, become directors, establish laboratories, saw grants, attach their own.  They communicate with the press, however, also with difficulty, - a scoop.  And in the west it is a developed class, they know how to work with the press, position themselves, colonize, occupy niches, establish religions.  It is almost impossible to find the person who read ‚ÄúThe Art of Programming‚Äù or ‚ÄúSpecific Mathematics‚Äù - those who consider Knut for authority are too stupid to read them, and those who are smarter - read better books.  Apparently, therefore, Knut paid 2.56 for every typo found, in the hope that at least they would read it.  All of his, if I may say so, books are a copy-paste of algorithms from Stanford journals, diluted with clumsy humor, the person just took up the topic on time.  And the "kids" from science read what adult uncles give them - bureaucrats and Chichikovs.  So it turns out that the bureaucrats have no brains, the Chichikovs have brains, but no conscience, crazy scientists are vulnerable people, they are offended. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Breathing when pronouncing the names, memorial plaques, my teacher was a wonderful person, status books and portraits in the study, cakes for the daughter of the professor, quotes and drawing in scientific journals - this is all academic originating.  This is where the Knut Bible was written.  He subscribes in Chinese characters and tells that he learned to program from the books of the Soviet Ershov, and does it all at every opportunity, methodically and accurately.  Pumping authority among the Aborigines.  The man is prokhavan.  Have you seen the sectarians of preachers from California on the far channels of the TV?  The whip is their relative, literally.  Numerical analysis of the Bible, lectures "Lord and Aichi".  And what's creative, the Bible - The art of programming is an associative array, this is California, baby.

      I'm not saying that it is good or bad - to be like Whip, I just see - SHARE.  It is necessary to read his books or not, everyone‚Äôs personal matter - I respect the free choice, and I simply state: everyone has it, no one reads it.  Sometimes they sit and dream in a beautiful pose, like a young lady with a volume of Byron.  Which, by the way, is also not bad, especially if tea, cakes, pleasant music.  Knut‚Äôs older comrade, Martin Gardner, is another matter - he graduated with a degree in philosophy, subtle gentlemanly humor, books were praised after reading, and not before, - they develop intelligence.  Mad scientist of the western sample. <br><br>  "Where is your evidence?"  And did you, dear reader, come to mind to study his figure?  Can you bypass the jams of authorities in your mind?  As Munchausen said: ‚ÄúIf the garden had grown, I would have said so - the garden, but if the tree had grown, then why should I lie?‚Äù By the way, my first computer was assembled from matchboxes according to the Gardner‚Äôs book, the boy didn‚Äôt I wanted to sell so many boxes, I had to ask adults. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a9/f83/4b2/2a9f834b24124c779fb76305045dc787.jpg">  <i>Donald Knut as Vasil Vyshivanny (Archduke in Embroidery).</i> <br><br>  Books on programming, in general, it is the tenth thing.  It is best to learn, first: from living people.  Just find yourself anyone who can program and learn from this person in a row.  You can look him in the mouth, run for a beer, carry a chair behind him ‚Äî it won't lose anything ‚Äî it's a sensei.  Even if in life is not a very pleasant person, a hunchback with a smell, or a loser.  And it is not necessary to learn a particular language or technology, but simply all that this person can and can show and tell on his fingers, it is interesting to show.  This is imputed knowledge, tone of voice, manner of sitting at the screen, you simply connect and absorb.  For starters, this is the best, but it also works for masters such as Lasseter and Miyazaki. <br><br>  Secondly, you need to program a lot.  Women can not program, can not sensitively connect to abstract activity.  When all screens are retina, and best of all fluffy, and the code will blink and breathe while displaying on its ‚Äúface‚Äù, everything that happens inside will not be torn away from the code.  But the inability to ‚Äúcling to the screen‚Äù is a scourge and an experienced programmer, when everything is concentrated in the head, a look at the screen does not excite a backlash, the sensitivity is turned off: the pain begins and the thought slips off.  Need a deep involvement, sticking.  You can simply put the child to the screen, it will stick, but an adult should be aware of his / her sensitivity.  Hence the desire to stick to the computer in general, even though the blogs read and jokes: the plan is this: to remain at the screen at any cost.  But this is not enough, it is necessary to immerse yourself in the programming process, set the current and feedback, the cycle ‚ÄúI edit, run, look at the results‚Äù should be started, the iteration should go, stop the iteration, and the train of thought will arise.  The stream of Mihai. <br><br>  And third: free browsing, this is the basic skill of a programmer, they used to walk around the walkers and libraries, the same thing now, but on the Internet: if you need to understand how pseudo-random numbers are generated, you just look on the Internet.  A child of 12 years old can already do this.  To be able to find the reference, tutorial, source code.  This is the most important skill of the modern person, the ability to find something concrete in the network, and the ability to deal with distraction, it is also SOS.  SOS, this is the syndrome of distracting conditions (or boobs), Shiny Object Syndrome.  SOS is a problem of our hyperinformation society, which was hunger for information even twenty years ago, I remember collecting stickers from foreign beer quite seriously, and now it has already become hyperinformational.  The problem of changes in the psyche with the transition to hyperinformation was discussed by Soviet scientists in the transfer of the Obvious Incredible to the silent 80s.  Developing a filter in the mind, the ability to maintain focus in the chaos of distracting objects.  And this is just the beginning, - we live in times of a quiet, slow, inaccessible Internet, we are waiting for the information singularity, stock up on valerian and the skill of free browsing. <br><br>  Well, the books should be read off-topic, but by people ‚Äî choose a highly intellectual and / or author you like, and read, learn how he thinks, how he sees.  For example, the Stroustrup book is terrible as a textbook on C ++, but the book is beautiful, it shows how the developer of a programming language and an experienced programmer think. <br><br>  In society, the programmer is a stranger.  Among officials, managers, accountants, customers, users - this is an alien, Alien-3.  He flew in from the planet "Science", where the roots of the profession are from, and only there, on the planet of the programmer, could they understand him.  But, in fact, no one is waiting for a programmer there either; a programmer in the scientific community is at the furthest periphery, not even a student.  The student is at least a well-known element, a ‚Äúchild‚Äù in the scientific community, it is sharpened to be nursed about it.  But the programmer emerged as a class somewhere on the outskirts of science, and lives there, no one knows how or what.  At one time, the proletariat came into being - people came from the village and began working in factories growing like mushrooms.  They began to live somewhere there, something is there, a completely new environment - urban neighborhoods for the working masses.  A programmer lives physically among all, but he is not of this world, he is of the world of science.  But in the world of science he has no place.  At first glance, modern science "is organized by the authorities."  But this is a false picture. <br><br>  All science is born of correspondence and the creation of interest clubs.  A community of enthusiasts.  Crazy scientists.  The history of science is p2p: people find each other, learn a nice gait.  Meaningful social circle, rhythmic correspondence, algorithmized process.  Found a house made of three hundred year old oak in the village of Charlibordo, - wrote to others: gracious Mr. Sarlvatore, I inform you that the oak can hold on for 300 years in the wet sandstone on the Adriatic coast.  The Lord took into account, brought in their notebooks, distribute further, retweet, favorites.  Dear Sir Karl, I am sending you a letter from our friend from Charlibordo, he tells you some curious information about the local oak species.  Mesh network.  Before it became noticeable to people, and ‚Äúgiven money‚Äù to it, the system worked autonomously for centuries.  Mostly parasitic on merchant mail traffic.  Traders noticed, began to sponsor, especially those who helped count profits faster, improved ships and wagons, and other trade technologies were pumped through innovations. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f2d/c64/bda/f2dc64bda0a04641a480c954a8403c95.jpg">  <i>The Hanseatic gentleman with his devices and documents feels himself in the 21st century, although the 16th is outside.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c74/18c/a9d/c7418ca9d4874b25b58dfdab1a732957.jpg">  <i>The Internet for 500 years before the Internet, the map of the Hanse.</i> <br><br>  Mr. Salvatore sits for two days, considers profits for his nabob, the remaining five days study stars, write, write treatises, write students to the gymnasium, talk about the essence of being.  This is how a university emerges, several types of people immediately come to it.  First, these are pupils of a merchant, nephews, basically, he sent them to study arithmetic, the second: survivors, people who lived side by side and just cut through, that they ‚Äúgive something‚Äù, you just have to put in wise words in time, you look for students will be accepted, or even as a scientist, they will be fed.  Chichikovs.  Thirdly, they are dreamers, ‚ÄúMikhail said that he was learning that in St. Petersburg they were learning, got on a fish wagon and went‚Äù - a mad scientist.  A scientific community is formed, in which there are a lot of people, but it still keeps on Mr. Salvatore, Sir Carla, and some new Michael Mikhailo is catching up.  Everyone has their own university, in which he has no one to talk with, and they correspond with each other.  Still.  Everything else - scientific journals, bureaucracy, academy of sciences, exams, diplomas, doctoral dissertations - this arises later to somehow streamline incoming youngsters in order to speed up the development of new types of guns for the state and adding machines for traders.  This is not a science, it is a scientific periphery.  Science is the correspondence of mad scientists. <br><br>  Since there is no place for programmers even in this periphery, they are on the periphery of the periphery, we can only get ourselves.  A similar problem was solved a hundred years ago, the proletariat appeared, a new class, there was no place for it in the system of that time.  What to do with it, how to control it, it was not clear how to live on its own, it is also not clear.  People have new skills, intelligence is ten times more powerful than the peasants: the ability to live in the city, to exist autonomously - outside the community.  Pumped supermen at the time, were able to read, count a little.  Lenin believed that they should be given power as the most intellectually advanced.  In the west, we have found a simpler way: well, if you are smarter and you need a more complicated lesson, please: consume.  As it turned out, consumption is able to fully occupy the mighty intellect of the proletariat and all its derivatives - clergy, service workers.  There was nothing to make a fuss with a new social formation.  Moreover, the brains of the proletariat was not enough to carry on with the gentlemen.  They showed a tape recorder, they gave a foreign car, they passed their proletarian state with giblets in two years.  Most likely, programmers basically will live under the roof of shopkeepers and bureaucrats, and they will be controlled further through consumption, only by super-consumption corresponding to the increased intelligence.  But there are some programmers, special ones. <br><br>  A programmer who has mastered a critical mass of skills and concepts, high-level algorithmization, is already becoming a nuclear reaction, and it will be very difficult for the establishment to contain it, an example of microsoftware, google and apples organized by programmers seems to hint.  Programmers alienated from trade, from science, from everything - they themselves can become a force, but for this they will have to use the technology of crazy scientists.  The ability to create branched horizontal networks, communicating with each other as sirs and signors were already able hundreds of years ago.  But with whom to correspond and build adult relationships? <br><br>  A person called me on Skype and said: "I am invisible on Skype, they just constantly call me and ask how are you, I'm tired of being distracted by nonsense."  Familiar picture?  Let's say you have 200 friends - school friends, relatives, people from the yard.  You drink, hang out, personal contact, smiles, hugs, walks, long conversations - this is your first level of social communication.  But one day you find out that no one is interested in your main topic - lambdas on Haskel, or startups - there‚Äôs no one to talk to, then you start looking for such people outside your circle.  Go out into the intellectual space.  On contact with highly organized life forms.  Alien meets Predator.  The second level of communication arises if there are several such aliens in your life, a network arises.  A proven combination is a communication in the first round, intellectual in the second.  Your personal question: how much do you want to limit communication in the first level, and how much time do you want to spend in outer space of the second? <br><br>  Do you feel that you are growing dull, in your twelve-thirty-forty, feeling that life ends?  The man is weak, the community is strong.  For example, you pick your program, slowly, for years, slower, and life will pass, but all of a sudden I am interested in you once a month - how are things going, dear sir?  And you have me.  And all at all.  There are many participants and they know each other's topics, a community arises and an electric current arises in it, in your heads, you sit down to write code and suddenly you realize that all community members are mentally with you, they are in your subject, you feel the desire to work in order there was something to show in the next conversation or meeting, and they feel the same thing.  The feeling of feedback and resonance.  All science, culture and aristocratic politics were built on this principle of moral support and common motivation.  Sincerity and maintaining joint intelligence at a certain level, joint expansion and a sense of the meaning of being, group security, and even an elementary withdrawal from loneliness and stagnation, and the ability to equal each other and learn.  This is the highest light.  Programmers can create such a community.  The question of some detachment from the first round is easily solved, many simply break off the old ties that pull down, but this is not enough and not even necessary.  The main thing is to connect to the second level, search for equal, other programmers with similar views, vision. <br><br>  At the first level of communication, you can behave half consciously, be distracted by emotions and burn time, and at the second level of friends - you HOLD, you personally, all together and individually, try to ‚Äúkeep yourself in society‚Äù - this is the second level.  Talk on business and on maximum intelligence.  To be "on top".  Usually rare, well-designed e-mails provide an opportunity to keep the bar of intellectual communication higher than the sit-in in Skype.  The desire to simply turn on Skype or get together in person is the hope that once you are among smart people, something clever will come to your mind.  Sometimes it comes, but the discipline of correspondence has been tested for centuries.  Skype is likely to be the same people as you, a bunch of zamylennyh and tired and confused.  And if they are at the level, and you are not?  Then what for you they need in their stupefied state?  The level of intelligence changes every half hour. <br>  Although sometimes catch languages ‚Äã‚Äãon Skype also awakens thought and motivation.  There is such Marinesku, the creator of one of the ‚ÄúAmerican Habrs‚Äù - InfoQ, the entire business leads virtually, there is no office, he writes a lot and talks about when it‚Äôs more convenient to use chat in virtual collaboration, and when emails, when special software, where Skype, how to establish a communication flow when spread across the planet. <br>  A person teaches us advanced things; at the same time PR is a typical ‚ÄúAmerican programmer‚Äù. <br><br>  A community is also a PR driver and access to other communities.  The whole history of Europe is free communities that communicate with each other.  Polisny world since antiquity.  A network is not only completely uniform, equal-level connections, it is a set of connected small centers. <br><br>  In the intellectual sphere, it does not matter - who first created aspirin or who, in fact, first invented radio - all that matters is, only who first wrote about this to the community, and the community picked up the idea, transmitted it to other communities.  And who else will catch her?  Do you think people are sitting somewhere and waiting for you with your brilliant idea, program?  In Skolkovo what?  Well, it would be cool, but only Skolkovo is the periphery of science, the bureaucracy created around the Chichikovs and, if we are lucky, a couple of crazy scientists.  Creating software and community is two sides of the same coin.  Someone, like Durov, will be able to create software for a ready and waiting community - students and graduates, and then the whole country.  There is a ready request for a technology or a project, but the real work and the real untapped fields are areas where you create both community and software.  This is not only business, but also the creation of human society as such.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The more communities, the higher the whole society, country, planet in the civilizational dimension.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For example, as a mental experiment, try to organize all the residents of the conventional high-rise building so that they perform basic algorithms to ensure that no one in their house ever offends anyone, does not rob, does not rob, in the elevator and the staircase would be clean and not written matt words. This is just an example, a scientific task on social algorithms and a potential niche for software. What a market of unsolved problems in our country and in the world in organizing people for a reasonable joint activity, even the simplest one. And it seems to be that complicated, it's just an intercom plus the principles of the social network, everything is algorithmic. Several functions are written, alarm, general collection, commit subbotniki, karma-reputation, vertical organization, horizontal, tracking of children's safety, tracking of suspicious personalities,running water pipelines - in order to turn a high-rise building into a safe and pleasant place, you need a code, an order, as for one site selling pizza on an angular. But you need to get out of the plane, to see the social dimension of algorithms.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It often happens like this: the guy wrote on the forum "Guys have an idea, let's muddle up the project," a startup, crowd-mining photos, library development, a warcraft clone, but that doesn't work! The public was created according to the principle - they installed software, whoever he wants, read it - this is not yet a community, it is a flock of monkeys. You can not organize a pack of monkeys. What does work? You can only find ONE person imbued with the same idea, the same level as you yourself, and hold on to it for years, resolve grievances and misunderstandings, enduring all the problems, developing a common language, discussing topics on intellect, and look for the third and then the fourth . It works. Americans often write that three is enough for a project to take off. You can not put a forum, bugtracker, create a repository, the main page, draw a logo in the inkscape, come up with a name and sit waiting for a miracle.Called lay and waiting for an orgasm. Miracles do not happen - you need a rhythm of communication, not a productive thing, but a rhythm of communication. Therefore, we must recognize each other by walking and hold each other and keep the level.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Here people put phpBB or more fashionable (best yet) Discourse and think that they have a community.</font></font> And why? ,       ,   ,  ,  ,   , , ,  .        ,   ,    . ,      ,         ,    ‚Äî  .       ,    ,   , ,   ,   ,  ,   ,  ,      ‚Äî     ,    ‚Äî  ,  ,        .              ,               .  ,    ,   .   ?  ,    ,      .             ,  ,          ‚Äî   ? <br><br> <b> </b> <br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/254531/">6:   </a> <br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/251793/">5:   </a> <br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/249839/">4:  ¬´¬ª</a> <br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/247619/">3:   </a> <br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/247363/">2:   </a> <br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/247251/">1:  </a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/247619/">https://habr.com/ru/post/247619/</a></p>
