  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Screw Surf: the future of communications - the robots</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  My last <a href="http://blogs.cioinsight.com/knowitall/content001/vint_cerf/">question to Vint Surf is</a> about the future.  What does the person who helped create the Web think about the future of technology and the prospects of the whole society, which is built around the Internet.  What will it be like in 20 or 50 years? <br><br>  ‚ÄúThis is a really difficult question,‚Äù said Surf.  ‚ÄúTwenty years ago, the commercial Internet access service was almost not delivered, and the WWW technology existed only in the head of Tim Berners-Lee, maybe there was some kind of program code, but it was not widely distributed,‚Äù he said after all this warning. still began to reason. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ‚ÄúLooking into the future, we can say a few things.  There will be significantly more access to the network.  No matter where you are, you will always have access.  This becomes a very important factor, because the concept of a distributed platform (cloud computing) becomes profitable for everyone only if you have access to it at any time when you need something, and in any volume.  I see a lot of usefulness in the distributed platform and expect it to be more and more accessible. <br><br>  What else do I expect in 20-50 years, and what I‚Äôm pretty sure about is the way we interact with online systems and even local ones.  Today, these are keyboards and mice, but I think that in the future, real interaction will become quite normal, including conversation and communication with gestures.

      If I have relevant devices constantly on me, then the location is constantly monitored, at least my device knows it, so my questions to it may concern local information, for example, where is the nearest restaurant? <br><br>  I also expect much more interesting types of interaction, including tactile.  Not just tachkriny, but the possibility of tactile interaction with remote objects.  Small robots, for example, which in fact are the embodiment of your body (instantiations of you) and controlled from a distance, give you what is called telepresence.  This is a big step forward compared to the kind of video telepresence that we are used to seeing now. <br><br>  This type of small robots is different from ordinary autonomous robots with their own "artificial intelligence".  Telepresence robots are not autonomous and have no intelligence, but they can sit in a meeting for you, allowing you to virtually attend several meetings at the same time, move there, talk to people and interact with things, see everything around, like ordinary people. ‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39090/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39090/</a></p>
