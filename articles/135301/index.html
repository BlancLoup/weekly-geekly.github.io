The goal of the project is the sustainable development of a civilization without conflicts. <br><br>  Jacques was born in 1916 and managed to catch the Great Depression, then received a good education and became known as an industrial designer and architect.  In recent years, he is committed to telling about a somewhat fantastic project of his dreams.  Just a couple of days ago, Digital October hosted his lecture (direct teleconference) about this project. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/77f/c23/8fe/77fc238fe2b3c91a7a2cf9b6dee67e90.jpg"><br>  <sup>Jacques in his creative lab</sup>

      <b>Here are the main points:</b> <br><ul><li>  The political system that worked well 50 years ago is now outdated. </li><li>  Most of the modern systems we owe to the Romans.  But they had a different society. </li><li>  We have already produced a huge knowledge base.  We need to develop it, and not to count money. </li><li>  Here are the calculations of what should be the city, the system of relationships, etc. </li><li>  Integration will be slow and smooth, but it needs to be done. </li><li>  The first thing to start with is to change the education system. </li><li>  The second is the transition to some form of government similar to communism. </li><li>  The third is the consistent automation of all routine processes, including government work. </li></ul><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Overview </h3><br>  Jacques began with a brief insight into his project.  Among other things, he noted that one of those things that need to be changed in the future is language.  The fact is that it is also outdated: depending on the context and cultural baggage, it allows you to perceive the same data differently <i>(approx. Orwell with his newspeak at one time summed up a fairly large base for why such a language is needed)</i> .  The new system will have a new language, and without a high level of interpretation.  For comparison, the language of mathematics and technology is a language that does not depend on cultural baggage, this language is the same.  Engineers understand each other well.  Technical documents will be read equally anywhere on the planet.  Communication in everyday language is very much tied to the context. <br><br><h3>  About politics </h3><br>  The political system worked well 50 years ago, but now science has made it completely outdated - and it is about to change our social life.  The Venus project is a new social system. <blockquote>  I do not believe in the beauty of a monetary economy.  I believe that most of the social vices are a consequence of the monetary economy. </blockquote>  Resource economy will have a higher efficiency.  Over time, a change in the economy will lead to a change in human behavior. <br><br><h3>  Pro population </h3><br>  Our planet can withstand only a certain number of people.  If we continue to develop as we do now, then disputes, conflicts, and so on will continue.  A small number of countries control most of the natural resources - this leads to war.  The easiest way from the point of view of humanity is to agree that natural resources belong to the whole world to all countries. <br><br>  But while we can not do it.  As long as we have police, military and other similar forces, as long as people live for themselves, there will be no civilized society.  If such a community is formed, it will show a good pace of improvement in welfare, so all the "breakaway" sooner or later change their mind.  Jacques does not consider himself a utopian.  Even what he is designing now will seem to be a straitjacket for our children.  The task is to move for the better, step by step, creating something ideal that seems optimal at the current moment and changing plans as the scientific, technical and social base grows. <br><br>  Here is an example: in the future there should be no cars - only well-designed public transport.  Such a system, for example, should work without any traffic lights at all.  Over time, all transport systems will be automated.  The same goes for other city systems.  The more time we have to design, the more we can automate. <blockquote>  Sooner or later we automate the government. </blockquote><br><br><h3>  About cities </h3><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2c5/b43/033/2c5b4303353f0c2d542b33ef30913480.jpg"><br>  <sup>This is the city of the future on today's projects.</sup>  <sup>All decisions about his device are made on the basis of scientific analysis.</sup>  <sup>Designed by Jacque Fresco, <a href="http://www.thevenusproject.com/">www.thevenusproject.com</a></sup> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c9a/3e2/455/c9a3e2455b8715c642c370fafd68508a.jpg"><br>  <sup>The device of the city: the outskirts are residential areas, then scientific centers, then tents of cultural objects, the center includes schools, shops, the core of transport systems, an intercity transport terminal, etc., the center itself is a common information terminal, a kind of oracle that performs prognostic function.</sup>  <sup>The city assumes the maximum use of geothermal sources, high-rise construction and other technologies <i>(approximately similar to the cities inhabited from ‚ÄúDysfunction of reality‚Äù)</i> .</sup>  <sup>Designed by Jacque Fresco, <a href="http://www.thevenusproject.com/">www.thevenusproject.com</a></sup> <br><br>  The current system is built on limited resources, but you can begin to act - for example, design cities - based on the available and available resources, using some kind of technocratic solutions.  Jacques shows his city project: ‚ÄúThe whole city can be a park.  You do not need, for example, to make kitchens in every house - you can make common restaurants. ‚ÄùThe profession of a waiter will also go away - for example, if you are diabetic, you will be offered only those dishes that you can. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5c/428/559/a5c428559ae117fa9e8ecbf1025cf38c.jpg"><br>  <sup>‚ÄúThe first kitchen factory in the USSR was opened in the spring of 1925 in Ivanovo-Voznesensk.</sup>  <sup>Many processes of cooking, as well as washing dishes and cutting vegetables and bread there were mechanized.</sup>  <sup>She served eight canteens at the factories of the city. ‚Äù</sup> <br><br><h3>  Control </h3><br>  One of the basic tenets of culture is freedom of choice.  However, there is now such a system (at least, Jacques speaks about the United States), in which people are chosen to maintain the existing order.  That is why the state places great emphasis on loyalty: without loyalty, it is difficult to keep the system unchanged.  Jacques believes that this requires revision: you need not ‚Äúlisten to the user‚Äù, but work as a system architect, putting forward perhaps unpopular, but useful for society and the planet as a whole solution.  Today, most people do not have loyalty to countries - and this is normal. <br><br><h3>  About the Terminator and Technocracy </h3><br>  Jacques says that the fear of cars comes from Hollywood.  We see cars kill people - and this creates fear.  Over time, we will be able to design more powerful machines.  Do not be afraid of the fact that cars can be more than a man, because it happened a long time ago.  Jacques does not believe that cars will experience emotions or have their own goals.  They can just work perfectly without interruptions. <br><br><h3>  About eugenics and education </h3><br>  Outstanding abilities are the product of social education.  It's nice to think that you were born a genius, but you can bring up a genius.  Genes define a lot, but circumstances - the social environment - often mean more.  Jacques for natural processes and motivation.  He tells how he taught the children to read: he read aloud, and then, at the most interesting place, yawned and said that he was tired.  When the son asked what was next, he said: ‚ÄúWell, if you could read, you would have already disassembled it yourself.‚Äù  Society should act in much the same way, motivating the participants, rather than forcing them. <br><br><h3>  About communism </h3><br>  Communism painted a similar picture of a brighter future, but did not give a solution to the problems.  No religion, no philosophical course offers solutions to specific problems.  Communism did not cancel the money, the police - he promised people a job, but not a creative one. <br><br><h3>  And finally - another illustration about the project. </h3><br><blockquote>  Imagine that golden rain started.  You collect gold dust and accumulate it in your closet ... and the golden rain does not end, and the dust becomes nowhere to go - it devaluates!  In the city of the future "Venus" there is no sense to accumulate anything - everything should be in prosperity! </blockquote><br><br><h3>  About Jacquet </h3><br>  Jacques is like an old professor, loves specifics (‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like my answer, just say: DON'T ANSWER. You don‚Äôt need this politeness here‚Äù), it doesn‚Äôt like the patent system, the army and a number of other things that it considers hopelessly outdated.  Soon he will be 96 years old: he does not want to ‚Äúsit in a chair and wait for death‚Äù, instead he tries to keep up to date with everything that happens in the world. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e0b/f73/22c/e0bf7322c6905fb09e5fa53d35d1144e.jpg"><br>  <sup>No, this is not the character of ‚ÄúIron Man‚Äù, but Jacques Fresco in his youth.</sup> <br><br><h3>  To learn more </h3><ol><li>  <a href="http://knowledgestream.ru/event-08.html">Video lecture in Russian and English + discussion</a> . </li><li>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D4%25F0%25E5%25F1%25EA%25EE,_%25C6%25E0%25EA">Jacques Fresco on Vicky</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thevenusprojectmedia">YouTube channel</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://www.thevenusproject.com/">Project site</a> and <a href="http://www.thevenusproject.com/ru/get-involved">how to become a member</a> . </li></ol><br><br>  <b>PS</b> In our <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/digitaloctober/blog/">corporate blog</a> , there will be regular reviews of such lectures with the text ‚Äúbased on‚Äù the video. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135301/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135301/</a></p>
