  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kiyosaki I: Computer version of the game Cashflow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I think many have heard about the books of Robert Kiyosaki.  And, again, many probably read both the book " <a href="http://lib.rus.ec/books.html/Kij%27osaki_Robert_i_Lechter_She%27ron_Bogatyj_papa_Bednyj_papa.html">Rich Dad, Poor Dad</a> ", and <a href="http://www.johntreed.com/Kiyosaki.html">devastating materials</a> about the works of Kiyosaki.  The identity of Robert Kiyosaki, the incompatibility of his books and reality, the usefulness / usefulness of the literary works themselves, I want to consider in the following parts of this series of articles (if, of course, the good will of haboobschestvennost). <br>  I totally want to devote the same part of the cycle to a rather low-lit part of the Kiyosaki training course, namely to his game ‚ÄúCashflow‚Äù or in the Russian translation - ‚ÄúFinancial Flow‚Äù. <br>  I'll start with a few quotes from the book ‚ÄúRich Dad, Poor Dad‚Äù already mentioned above. <br><blockquote>  The game ‚ÄúCASHFLOW‚Äù is intended to give each player personal feedback.  Its purpose is to give a person a chance to choose.  If a person, a player, pulls out a card with a drawn boat, and the boat turns into debt, the question arises: ‚ÄúWell, what can you do now?‚Äù What is the most reasonable thing to do in this situation?  The goal of the game is to teach players to think, to <b>find a way out of any situation</b> . <br><br>  I saw thousands of people playing this game.  Those who got out of the ‚Äúrat race‚Äù faster than the others were people who understood what was behind the numbers and had a creative financial mind.  These people recognized the possibility of several financial actions.  Those who played ‚ÄúCASHFLOW‚Äù longer in time were people who did not understand the numbers, did not realize the power of investment.  Rich people are very creative and always risk prudently, consciously. <br><br>  I watched people, and I watch people who play ‚ÄúCASHFLOW‚Äù and complain that <b>cards that give good opportunities do not come to them</b> .  So they have to sit doing nothing.  I know similar people in real life.  They sit, and you can sit and wait for a lifetime.  It is as if sitting in a car and waiting for the green light to come on at the traffic lights 5 miles ahead before moving off. <br></blockquote><br>  Having intrigued you, my reader, I will not keep you waiting - you can <a href="http://ifolder.ru/5191939">download the game</a> ( <a href="http://drop.io/cashflow">mirror</a> ) right now, interrupting this boring reading, so those who read the book at one time, but could not find the game, would do that.  If this small clue is not enough for you, I suggest <a name="habracut"></a>  read more. <br>  The cashflow version presented by reference is the so-called demo version of the computer version of the casflow board game.  Those.  Kiyosaki with someone else once developed a cashflow board game, like "Monopoly", then made a computer game based on it, and then a demo version of this software was created for popularization, without videos and animations (which I, who played the full version of cashflow 101 only seems to be a plus, because you can play 7 times faster and hold more parties at the same time, but 101 apparently allows you to get more into the leisurely rhythm of the board game, and in real life where everything happens slowly :-)). <br>  So Cashflow is a game that should help anyone who feels, or is confident that, in life, he "does not receive good cards", to become a person who can "find a way out of any situation."  And, I can say, the game successfully copes with this task.  It is easy to win once by chance in cashflow.  For this you just need luck.  To win constantly, or at least in 8 cases out of 10, and in the rest to get second place - you need something more than luck.  We need a strategy, understanding and approach. <br>  But even a complete bummer who even too lazy to set a goal to win can learn from the game: <br><ul><li>  financial reporting basics </li><li>  learn to distinguish liabilities from assets </li><li>  learn to determine what free money is and how it appears </li><li>  feel in their own skin how loans work </li><li>  feel with your own hands the real estate market, stocks, startups </li><li>  see that the "rich" specialists are no sweeter than the poor </li></ul><br>  The gameplay offers a kind of simplified model of the real world, its financial and investment slice, in which events of various types constantly arise: <ul><li>  opportunity deal (deal).  In the game this happens, if not at every turn, then at every second step - every second cell is a potential deal.  There are big (big) and small (small, up to $ 6000) </li></ul>  the remaining cells (every eighth) are divided among themselves: <ul><li>  salary (yellow - a positive effect on the balance) salary, charged on passing through this cell </li><li>  unexpected expenses (scarlet, or pink-red) </li><li>  Market - market events like changes in interest rates on loans, increased demand for real estate, etc. (blue) </li><li>  and finally lilac - large fin.  Trouble (as contrasting to yellow) is dismissal and the appearance of a child.  As I understand it, the amount of trouble was reduced from three to two, and one cell was later replaced by the orange cell, ‚ÄúCharity‚Äù </li></ul><br>  The speed of movement is regulated by the die roll. <br>  Thus, the probability of 1/12 to make serious troubles, 1/2 - to get on the deal, 1/8 - to get to the market, 1/8 - make unforeseen expenses, 1/8 - play for nothing, i.e.  just get on the payroll cell, and 1/24 - to get the opportunity of a charitable act.

      The player constantly, at every second step, offers for deals of various degrees of profitability are poured in, and the player must decide which ones to carry out and which not.  In addition, transactions can be put up for auction or sold directly to another player. <br>  The goal of the game is to get out of the rat race, i.e.  accumulate enough passive income (passive income) to cover fully its expenditure part of the fin.  reports  In this way, a player can leave his current job ‚Äúto his uncle‚Äù and completely free his time. <br>  Thanks to this, he enters a new world, a world of large transactions, and a big business where he already either realizes his dream, or engages in pleasant, very relaxed investing in large, always profitable assets, without the need to fill out financial statements (accountants do it for you: - )). <br>  Who is the first to realize his dream, or he has got a VERY lot of passive income - that is considered the winner.  The game can end as with the first released from the outer circle, and with 2-3 exited, which is set in the settings. <br><br>  I will not deprive the inquisitive and creative mind of the habra people to independently figure out all aspects of the game, only from non-trivial: <ul><li>  a bank where you can take any loan at any time is called by pressing the piggy bank at the top </li><li>  credits are given there </li><li>  You can write off the expenses with which we already come into the game, and credit card debts can only be written off all at once. </li></ul><br><br>  As a goal to be achieved, I suggest the following - to be in time to reach the outer circle first in 8 out of 10 cases with 4 computer opponents, with a randomly chosen initial specialty (you can basically click back and forth until you get ‚Äúexpensive‚Äù or ‚Äúpoor "A specialty that can be used for training with a given amount of money). <br>  If you have three sessions in a row, 10 games (for example, 10 games every day), you managed to achieve this result - I can congratulate you, you took your first step towards financial literacy and how the hell do these familiar ones work and still surround us money :-).  Why 8 out of ten and no less than the second?  Because in real life, loss will mean either the usual hopeless, constantly financially limited existence, or credit bondage.  Therefore, it is worth a little longer to play, and learn to win at least in this simple financial simulator. <br><br>  For those who cannot cope with finding a solution, I will give several spoilers in the third part of this cycle.  You have time to find it yourself - dare.  Enjoy your <a href="http://ifolder.ru/5191939">game</a> ( <a href="http://drop.io/cashflow">mirror</a> ), and be successful! <br><br>  PS In this topic, I am ready to answer any questions regarding the game, clarify ambiguities, clarify inaccuracies, advise and help in every way to help anyone who started playing with my submission to this game.  Feel free to contact me - I will help :-). </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/19911/">https://habr.com/ru/post/19911/</a></p>
