  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The fourth galaxy is here</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good afternoon, Habr! <br><br>  Two weeks ago, Samsung unveiled its new flagship smartphone GALAXY S4.  This event was preceded by a large-scale advertising campaign aimed at ensuring that everyone and everyone knew about the announcement of the novelty, except perhaps for the <s>dead of the</s> lazy.  Many assumptions and speculations, rumors and real leaks about the gadget passed through the media over the past six months, reaching a peak in the last couple of days before the announcement.  And, finally, on March 17, the presentation with fanfare and fanfare took place at Radio City Hall, which in New York was a grandiose show with actors, orchestra, surprises, and large-scale visual effects.  In general, everything is as it should be. <br><br>  It should be recognized that we were somewhat late with the announcement of the new flagship on Habr√©, but, to date, the network still does not have a single detailed review of the device (not counting the blitz reviews from the exhibition itself).  Now, when, finally, all passions have subsided, the excitement and all announcements have died down, we would like to soberly and balancedly describe the new smartphone, as well as draw parallels, track the continuity and compare the capabilities of Samsung's predecessor GALAXY S III and its follower - GALAXY S4.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/6b2/775/f16/6b2775f162de998317e6ed4faa9a7f8c.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  <font color="ffd800">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DESIGN</font> </h2><br>  Samsung GALAXY S3 was so successful in terms of the appearance of the device that Samsung decided not to deviate much from the given conceptual direction, while working on the design of the GALAXY S4.  Any user will know the rounded edges of his body and the lone ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button at the bottom of the smartphone instantly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/33f/91d/b30/33f91db303f1a74bbc7b46b254e0de43.png"><br><br>  The texture has changed a bit, the edge around the screen has diminished, the edges are decorated a little differently ... There is nothing more to say here.  ;) On the screen we will stop separately and in more detail.  The 3rd generation of the Galaxy possessed a glossy plastic casing, and in the 4th it was replaced by textured polycarbonate. <br><br><h2>  <font color="60ff00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">DIMENSIONS</font> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5c0/f6d/955/5c0f6d955c710cf16dcca1ea58c17956.png"><br><br>  One of the key points in the novelty is the size of the device, which not only did not increase (despite the fact that the iron in the smartphone is much more powerful), but on the contrary: the case became thinner by almost a millimeter (it was 8.6 mm, it became 7.9 mm) and lighter (it was 133 g, it became 130 g) than its predecessor. <br><br><h2>  <font color="00a8ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">SCREEN</font> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fda/c50/d95/fdac50d956172ef0b4b22789eba945b9.png"><br><br>  As for the screen, then Samsung has fully met the expectations of the audience: GALAXY S4 has a 5-inch Super AMOLED display with a resolution of Full HD (1080x1920).  GALAXY S3 could boast of a 4.8 inch Super AMOLED screen with a resolution of HD (720x1280).  The density of the screen of the new flagship is also impressive - 441ppi.  The frame around the screen has become even thinner - and this is noticeable even with the naked eye.  Other advantages: black-black color (no glow in the dark), maximum viewing angles, very bright and juicy colors.  At the same time, this screen is 25% more economical than conventional Super AMOLED matrices.  It is also worth noting that GALAXY S4 was the first to acquire a new protective coating for the screen from Corning - Gorilla Glass 3. The main advantage of the updated version is the improvements at the molecular level, which are called Native Damage Resistance (NDR).  Compared to its predecessor, the latest version of Gorilla Glass managed to achieve a three-fold increase in protection against external influences, but even if a scratch does appear, it will be 40% less noticeable.  Also, Gorilla Glass 3 is two times thinner than its previous version.  Well, another no less pleasant "bun" is the ability to work with the screen in gloves. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff0000">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">CAMERAS</font> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/91d/b43/6dd/91db436dd00c4dd2ca3406c6e51cf0d6.jpeg"><br><br>  Cameras are an important and integral part of any modern smartphone: many, many users of mobile devices prefer their individual compact cameras.  Samsung GALAXY S4 will please the main 13-megapixel camera, complete with autofocus and LED flash.  On the front is a 2 megapixel camera.  Both cameras have the function of recording Full HD-video at a frequency of 30 frames per second.  GALAXY S3 was equipped with weaker cameras: 8-megapixel rear and 1.9-megapixel front. <br><br><h2>  <font color="9000ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">PROCESSOR</font> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0db/321/a71/0db321a71dee0324e029d411f983d6ba.png"><br><br>  The international version of the Samsung GALAXY S4 will be equipped with the Samsung Exynos 5 Octa 5410 processor, which integrates four Cortex-A15 cores with a clock frequency of 1.6 GHz, four energy-efficient Cortex-A7 cores with a clock frequency of 1.2 GHz, and One of the best graphics accelerators on the market for mobile devices is PowerVR SGX 544MP3.  For some markets, a different smartphone version will be released, built on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 quad-core chip with a clock frequency of 1.9 GHz and Adreno 320 graphics. The S3 predecessor "thought" with a 1.4-GHz quad-core Exynos 4412 processor. <br><br><h2>  <font color="ff9c00">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">MAIN TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS</font> </h2><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e2/fbe/0af/7e2fbe0afd8b40c5b77e71fd26c04055.png"><br><br>  The new smartphone has onboard 2 GB of RAM, from 16 to 64 GB of flash memory and a slot for microSD cards, Wi-Fi 802.11 a / b / g / n / ac, NFC and Bluetooth 4.0, GSM, HSPA + and LTE (all frequency), GPS / GLONASS.  The battery capacity is 2600 mAh, which is 500mAh more than it was in the GALAXY S3.  This resource should be enough for an enlarged screen, a powerful processor and a more voracious 4G for a day or more.  The battery itself is removable, so you can carry a spare with you if you are thinking of traveling for a long time.  In addition to the usual accelerometer, light and proximity sensors, compass and gyroscope, Samsung has equipped its new flagship with a variety of different sensors, including an atmospheric pressure, temperature and humidity sensor.  It is also worth noting the infrared port that turns the smartphone into a universal remote control and the ability to connect external displays via MHL 2.0. <br><br><h2>  <font color="0c00ff">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">NEW FEATURES AND FUNCTIONS</font> </h2><br>  Samsung GALAXY S4 is equipped with Android OS version 4.2.1 "out of the box."  Upgrade to Android 4.2.2 will occur in April, immediately after the release of the smartphone.  Also in the presence of an updated interface TouchWiz Nature UX.  The most interesting and useful innovations in the functionality of the smartphone will look in detail. <br><br>  <b>Samsung KNOX.</b>  It includes a security enhancement package at the level of the Android operating system called Security Enhanced Android (SE Android) and unified application management.  KNOX offers a ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù solution for mobile devices, which separates the business problem from the personal space at the file system encryption level.  In this way, both corporate and personal information, data and applications are protected against information leaks, viruses and malicious attacks. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a2a/6a3/c1a/a2a6a3c1a75b0a501f12a69555ded58f.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Dual Camera</b> allows you to take photos and shoot video, using both cameras simultaneously. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/656/692/aa0/656692aa0b71b56ef97f3fb59917eb9c.png"><br><br>  <b>Dual Video Call.</b>  With this feature, you can make and receive video calls, also using two cameras simultaneously. <br><br>  <b>Sound &amp; Shot</b> allows you to take a photo with which the soundtrack will remain. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/56a/d71/5fc/56ad715fc5c7f0dc6f7efd7d4c3fe1bb.png"><br><br>  <b>Drama Shot</b> makes it possible to take a series of photos in a row and combine them into one image. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/396/45a/92f/39645a92f86954d60e8b6bf2fc4646d9.png"><br><br>  With <b>Group Play,</b> you can share music, photos and games to other GALAXY S4 smartphones that are nearby, without the need for mobile networks or a Wi-Fi connection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7d1/0d5/bbd/7d10d5bbd9aee3eb29a870d14ba461dc.png"><br><br>  <b>Story Album</b> will make from your photo gallery a complete life story in the manner of a timeline on Facebook: using geolocation, notes and weather information.

This function is probably familiar to you on the Samsung GALAXY Note II smartphone, but there it worked only with the S Pen, and in the GALAXY S4 it will also respond to your fingers.  With Air View, you can activate previews of videos, photos, emails, and appointments scheduled in S Planner without having to launch the appropriate applications ‚Äî just drag your finger to the screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f0a/019/826/f0a01982666ae131f1854aa75ea2a4c2.png"><br><br>  <b>Air Gesture</b> gives you control over certain functions with specific gestures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba2/b46/9dd/ba2b469ddbe431f96cf9baa38b327003.png"><br><br>  The <b>Smart Pause</b> function is built into the media player of the smartphone.  When watching a video, it pauses playback if the user looks away from the screen.  To resume viewing, you just need to look back at the device screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/21f/fc9/49f/21ffc949ff7b4012c0c99cf1a3b7e355.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Smart Scroll</b> allows you to scroll through lists, web pages or bulk emails with a simple eye movement and a slight tilt of the smartphone away from you. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/68b/d0d/000/68bd0d0004d3f5381e6c4bf24da47f49.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>S Voice Drive</b> is a kind of ‚Äúhands-free‚Äù for controlling a smartphone using voice commands if you are driving. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/78b/b31/551/78bb31551a8e3f560f90bd163d11e359.png"><br><br>  <b>S Health</b> monitors the health of the user based on a systematic daily analysis of information received from several sensors built into the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/032/0e0/902/0320e090290892f27e95d00036156bef.png"><br><br>  <b>Optical Reader</b> is used for automatic recognition of text, the content of business cards and QR codes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d3f/bb1/07c/d3fbb107c39b9fd8948eaeac69946310.png"><br><br>  <b>S Translator</b> provides instant translation of words, letters, messages and chats in 9 different languages, and also supports voice input. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/06f/887/206/06f887206b3fa3d0f4bfb7dc7366d7d7.png"><br><br>  <b>WatchON</b> turns a smartphone into a universal remote control for a TV, multimedia center, Blu-ray player and even air conditioning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/132/ee2/e4c/132ee2e4ca3124f26f649534b64610f6.png"><br><br>  <b>ChatON</b> is an international mobile messaging service that allows you to chat with friends one by one and in groups.

In addition, it is logical that the market of fitness accessories is becoming more appetizing, even for companies that previously had only a small or indirect relation to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/dc1/13d/447/dc113d4473d46b0d8004dcdcca1d2565.jpg"><br><br>  Samsung has not become an exception, having seen a lot of potential in a new niche, so GALAXY S4 is designed to become a loyal assistant to its owners in the fight for healthy lifestyles, monitoring the state of vital signs and maintaining vitality (S Health function).  And all this can be done using a new smartphone in conjunction with a variety of additional accessories. <br><br><h2>  <font color="E97784">‚ñå</font> <font color="000000">ACCESSORIES</font> </h2><br>  Samsung has taken into account all the wishes of the audience and prepared in advance many interesting accessories and useful products in addition to the new flagship.  Almost immediately after the announcement of the Samsung GALAXY S4, the attention of the thirsty supplement audience presented a variety of accessories for a smartphone, including traditional protective covers and original accompanying gadgets, including a gamepad joystick (gamepad), special scales and a heart rate monitor.  All this variety will be on sale immediately after the launch of the new product itself. <br><br>  First of all, it is worth mentioning the traditional accessories: a <b>headset</b> , classic <b>Flip Cover flip covers</b> in a variety of colors to suit every taste, <b>slipcases,</b> and <b>an extra battery with a charging dock</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/be7/feb/ac4/be7febac4d735e8b33096324f563050d.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>S View Cover</b> is a proprietary Samsung protective case designed specifically for the GALAXY S4.  Its difference from typical folding covers lies in a small window that appeared at the top, and through which you can keep track of time or various notifications without having to open the cover of the cover.  In addition, through it, the name and number will be visible when an incoming call is received, which can be answered by pressing the ‚ÄúHome‚Äù button, also without touching the case. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/bbf/70e/566/bbf70e5668d80fde8703bf3313f3c551.png"><br><br>  <b>Protective Cover +</b> - the so-called "hard" cover.  It is made of thermoplastic and leaves open only the screen of the smartphone - everything else is protected from bumps and scratches. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a5c/541/3e8/a5c5413e8ec1b3ada08b7b4680ed7c7c.png"><br><br>  <b>Included with this extra battery</b> is not only a spare battery, but also a charger / holder in the form of a docking station with a lid, which is installed at a convenient angle to support the GALAXY S4.  In addition, at the top of the charger there is an LED indicator that displays the charging process and changes color when charging is complete. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/7e8/fcf/4ff/7e8fcf4ffddd69c515b9b7b6844943e3.png"><br><br>  The GALAXY S4 has a long-awaited wireless charging feature.  In honor of this event, Samsung has released a <b>wireless</b> Qi <b>charger</b> and looks like a mouse pad.  It can be conveniently located near the workplace or on the bedside table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/c38/791/97f/c3879197f26139617f796a824c4f24cf.png"><br><br>  And this gadget is designed to please the gaming part of the audience: the new accessory is a convenient and painfully familiar design joystick aka gamepad, which, by the way, can work not only with GALAXY S4, but also with any smartphone whose screen diagonal is 4 to 6.3 inches.  Connecting to a smartphone via Bluetooth, and the gadget is equipped with a full set of gaming input tools: two analog sticks, a cross joystick and a lot of buttons.  As a result, we have a full-fledged portable console on the Android OS without the need to purchase a separate device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4b/b29/233/b4bb2923350cdd3d86f69744e938b82d.jpeg"><br><br>  Especially for the S Health app, Samsung has released a number of additional accessories.  Bracelet <b>S Band</b> can count steps, total distance traveled, calories and even follow the sleep process.  In a word, the owner of the accessory will never be left unattended - it can be worn without taking off around the clock, because it is protected from external influences and can even dive under water to a depth of 10 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e72/5be/bb9/e725bebb90d99f0d2eacccfad6b9a76e.jpeg"><br><br>  A real-time heart rate monitor monitors the user's heart rate and sends readings to the S Health app. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/71b/ea1/739/71bea17397210592470024d4adee63ed.png"><br><br>  <b>Body Scale</b> scales, like a heart rate monitor, will send information to a smartphone via Bluetooth.  The smartphone, in turn, will give its owner advice on weight adjustment.
