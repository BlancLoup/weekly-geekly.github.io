Having eaten pizza around the corner of the trade and entertainment complex, we again walked along the graffiti road.  We also walked along the second floor of the city (yes, this is Helsinki - a high-rise city, cyber punk iz n0w!) And found even more masterpieces.  Patiplace under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Filmed graffiti on a better camera. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ek/6u/pz/ek6upznalfcz6i1gu60ju6clvng.jpeg">

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vs/yw/op/vsywoppzyy8ovmihlw9qvbqrbqk.jpeg"><br><br>  Please note that these grandmothers in hand.  Immediately understand where you are and what you =) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_p/u2/rf/_pu2rfte2op9pgbsff1cvboysgo.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ee/cs/np/eecsnp1opbru_lqt6nxr9l0zdl0.jpeg"><br><br>  This is an elevator to the other floors of the city.  It is curious that trees grow on the upper floors.  And not very frail sizes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-g/uq/vu/-guqvuzieihnvq_udfml52rlnjc.jpeg"><br><br>  I must say that the pizza has fallen in price.  Every year the price tag, expressed in euros, is cheaper.  Well, do not eat we came here.  So finally we got it. <br><br>  Entrance to the Mesukeskus trade fair. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bv/3z/ys/bv3zys0-douubjwsgkmehyiecpm.jpeg"><br><br>  We pass on and go down to the holy of holies: paaaaatypleis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pr/zr/vk/przrvkkfbm5zn2i6mbb5fetc95s.jpeg"><br><br>  Stand of the Finnish Army.  BTR of course - credit!  I wanted to climb on it already, I already found with my eyes where to put my foot on it, but I remembered that it was not a mockup, but a fully working machine, which drove into the hall under its own power.  I should have asked for permission, but I didn‚Äôt understand what the political situation was, so I didn‚Äôt want to draw attention to myself. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/i2/aj/5x/i2aj5xtbjkwtj0ahyivbecqwski.jpeg"><br><br>  It looks like a platform for playing tournaments.  There were several such sites.  Played in CS: GO, Rainbow Six, Overwatch, Dota 2. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ek/6m/6e/ek6m6e6qacebmi2fh5to2-blwqq.jpeg"><br><br>  On the left - a deflated gaming PC, with water cooling, two vidyukhi and everything it should be.  What is on the right?  - also comp!  New type of system unit.  This is the stand of some company that develops and sells such toys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qs/hx/8u/qshx8u_d-nbs0sspfejeidfnhee.jpeg"><br><br>  There were also stands with laptops, behind which you could just stand and play.  They have a lot of games preinstalled, like in the good old days of computer clubs.  But this is not a novelty of this party.  In Helsinki, in many stores, you can first try out the equipment before you buy.  In the shops of mobile devices, sometimes they even make a special chillout corner where you can easily make a favorite tablet before you buy it without haste or stress. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gm/z4/xs/gmz4xs68jryljw1vlciftyjz0x0.jpeg"><br><br>  At the entrance there was some ad for a set of betta testers for some kind of game there.  At first I thought it was a queue there.  Then it turned out that people, having reached their turn, turn some wheel and get something there.  I still do not understand what it is.  But the queue was consistently day, and by night, when the halls were empty, this queue became even longer. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jc/qz/hq/jcqzhq694saeew27lfa34pyhzzc.jpeg"><br><br>  Oh, but this is generally the beauty of beauty!  Pay attention to the cubic monitor, suspended from the ceiling.  This is a chill out area where you can lie down and relax.  But do not just lie down.  Here they test for those who want a special pillow, in which the speakers are embedded.  You connect with a pillow with your blue tooth and watch YouTube for example.  In addition, the pillow can vibrate and massage.  But for me personally, boards with nails hammered into them are closer.  Do not rely on us, samurai, such calf tenderness. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/id/vg/5c/idvg5cy-cmayqamzl_bxh_2hgz8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mr/q4/uy/mrq4uynct7hwltmjekeolouqbyk.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4z/qr/ie/4zqrie1bp_v6k4szn7zehlgcy-a.jpeg"><br><br>  And this is the area where all kinds of PC-shny devices for sale were sold.  Mice, headphones, video cards - all top and at a discount of 30%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/m2/ww/q-/m2wwq-7rfujitvy4vprwprexfwi.jpeg"><br><br>  This - merch, all sorts of football and blouses with the logos of the festival.  There was also a super-sewing machine, where the girl embroidered any logo to order. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rs/cg/mj/rscgmjuy7kq8k1omqbxsj7ivqwg.jpeg"><br><br>  This is the stand of the Finnish School Game Deva.  Very cool school need to say.  Graduates at the end of doing real games, and the school helps students in the promotion of these games.  And I must say this a little more than regular Tetris.  Of course, unity, and yet the games of local graduates are very close to what can be seen here, for example, on the YouTube channel of the gamedev.ru guest, Comrade Ducat-a: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMr6jfAPZnNORCRp__S-tLA">‚ÄúDucat - Indie Games‚Äù</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/c7/ei/0t/c7ei0thplwxyf0uzjqejtvvzcdq.jpeg"><br><br>  Well, vibro-pillows in the cillout zone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7b/u2/h7/7bu2h7ynbm76egaxcfsnr2xb-xw.jpeg"><br><br>  Smiles, right? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ev/xb/rj/evxbrjfyudtkwc4xvybtxgo2alo.jpeg"><br><br>  Piles of cheap nishtyak, piles.  I bought myself a Finnish-made mouse, Roccat.  I must say, they are doing better and better every year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/d6/pm/ba/d6pmba9mbj1dr2q33ouznoiotxo.jpeg"><br><br>  Sewing machine for stripe logos. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sl/4l/bi/sl4lbi1ezlaalyqxlxkbapnu5dm.jpeg"><br><br>  This is what the infodesk looks like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j1/jd/ou/j1jdouoaaxhjobv2hybw8ainybq.jpeg"><br><br>  Allow me, I will not comment on this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oy/do/ws/oydowsgfni1rj42msjrotlgkk6w.jpeg"><br><br>  Next to this place I found an interesting picture.  Two girls somehow sexually greedily unpacked the box with the hero from OverWatch, and the guy took it off, apparently, for the video blog.  Figure for coloring, as in Soviet times.  And yet, one more time ... _girls_, a pretty witch of appearance, with a desire and genuine interest, unpacked the box with the hero OverWatch.  Well, I ... well, I am always very happy at such moments, and I think ... about my own.  Fotkat these things did not, not in the zoo. <br><br>  And in the photo just stand the Finnish army. <br><br>  Oh yes, everything was right there, close by, was the stern.  They sold food there.  I must say, the portions are very large, and it costs only 7 euros.  And do not go anywhere.  And of course, very tasty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3k/p0/x7/3kp0x7i4o3hnborm3noryppggoa.jpeg"><br><br>  Seminar room.  The presentation is on the monitor, and the narrator is on the right, in the dark, at a special table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jf/me/t0/jfmet0zp6qpgc7vl7m3wm9nvrso.jpeg"><br><br>  A table with some kind of microcircuits, spare parts, and there somewhere there was still a 3d printer ... This is a stand of some kind of self-made.  For some reason, always remember <a href="https://habr.com/users/easy_john/">easy_john</a> looking at this stand.  I myself do not understand this. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xj/fp/ge/xjfpge_bnn4uf6ivvcfjzi9grtm.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/9c/fq/6v/9cfq6vbofhfepjv8qz5n0bgey98.jpeg"><br><br>  Retro computers and slot machines.  In the comments, I was asked to take a picture of retro in more detail.  I photographed, I will post in the report for the day of the third. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ue/o3/wx/ueo3wxduqxkinjjiuadrvmuxjw4.jpeg"><br><br>  Geeeeeem fight.  I love this thing very much. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pf/qq/dr/pfqqdrn2zgdbxk1u8bltlkkr4p8.jpeg"><br><br>  Of course, all the exhibits could sit and play. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rb/0x/9n/rb0x9nq8gnxsdcwpoafl4kau_b4.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-o/ex/uw/-oexuwqksug1kgbbwrbgycbz8tq.jpeg"><br><br>  And this is a stand with a racing simulator.  Last year there was a whole tournament for them, a specially equipped section.  This time there were only 4-5 such gaming machines.  I rolled on it.  To be honest, not very much.  The chair works somehow very poorly, the steering wheel has almost no feedback, the pedal stroke is unrealistically large.  In general, the car in this slot machine, I did not feel.  Although there were several other models of this machine.  Or my machine was set up like this.  However, very cool.  Especially for those who come here with children. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5t/pl/aw/5tplawgnysl-9xs5dh5_decvy9i.jpeg"><br><br>  And here he played a very good psyambient, in this zone.  I did not understand what is there, but it looks like an old computer club.  And the flower curtains apparently should have been even better to set up a visitor to this zone for the deepest nostalgia.  Um, did the flowery curtains in Finnish computer clubs really exist?  Quite possibly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ky/cv/gd/kycvgdemhbrkel6bzuvoblj2zyo.jpeg"><br><br>  Yes, there were T-shirts with heroes from Quake.  Now I sit and think, but why didn‚Äôt I buy it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xk/b8/so/xkb8socv97dcilhcdzytb1gxmgk.jpeg"><br><br>  A mountain of souvenirs and all sorts of goodies.  Art books, swords, board games, books, caps, key chains, toys.  But that toy that I wanted was not.  Neither Tux (the Linux penguin logo) nor the Beasty (imp FreeBSD logo imp) was here.  It's a pity.  This is a serious shortcoming, in my opinion. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/is/qc/9r/isqc9rxlmkikn9cto9v3pmqlzd8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7v/as/is/7vasisk815b__0uwiwyw-upkzsw.jpeg"><br><br>  Hockey area.  Soviet youth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xl/xf/ae/xlxfae6l6ocxspphnedful-7tqg.jpeg"><br><br>  Here one could sit and play Sonya.  Everything is free and unlimited. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gc/kx/py/gckxpywvvxr9ywioyth5blc-ayw.jpeg"><br><br>  Well, where do without dancing.  By the way, cool zone to cling girls.  Here such smart ones came that for each of them you need a separate photo session. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ej/aq/l6/ejaql6pi1gkl92hbhf5qtzmbapm.jpeg"><br><br>  And that's it.  Demos will be in future releases.  I plan to post a photo for the third day, then a detailed discussion of the demos themselves, well, and if I have enough, then all sorts of advice regarding a trip to Fink and a stay at the party place.  Wait for the next issues. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/420331/">https://habr.com/ru/post/420331/</a></p>
