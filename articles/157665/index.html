  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 in Moscow</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Yesterday I was at a joint presentation of Nokia and Microsoft in the SHELK loft, I saw a cut of two Steve bosses: Elop and Ballmer.  I was counting on being able to get a test device, but, alas, I couldn‚Äôt get it yet.  I think it might just be to buy the Lumia 920 the other day, but I‚Äôll see if I‚Äôm not promising yet, because a couple of eBay purchases are already planned: a stick and mini stadia for a smartphone - they are much more relevant to me now.  Anyway, I managed to take a couple of photos on the Lumia 920 and for comparison on the Nokia 808 PureView, and throw them into my laptop.  I can confirm that the user part of the Lumia 920 disk appears in Win7 as an external flash drive.  But first things first. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f91/839/974/f918399748f0718ea316b72b40dd1661.jpg" alt="image">

    <h4>  Szveskaya Chronicle </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6be/830/710/6be830710c02c4924a913e829b1cc10f.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  So, at about half past five in the evening it-journalists and friends of Nokia and Microsoft began to flock to Savinsky in the SHELK loft. It is noteworthy that at the entrance they did not give out any badges, that is, at a party through cardards of various levels and face Someone from the organizers knew by sight.  No rush about the expected arrival of VIPs, I personally did not notice.  The hall in which the presentation was to take place was closed, but the doors of the reception hall were wide open.  Here they drank, ate and talked for the future of the it-industry journalists and company employees.  Overall it was very spacious, pleasant and productive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/001/355/072/001355072e3424eb5b25f1d565945583.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9fd/d1f/246/9fdd1f246321aa2eaed914d62ca63c17.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a59/a7b/834/a59a7b8342c3d967218d44e4334347e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1eb/a9e/27f/1eba9e27fd1dcff6258c016e8b464a8e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/205/204/15b/20520415bd6d89b332447fe493b6a0fb.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/978/828/7b6/9788287b61d3adbff4ca576232d70613.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5aa/15a/409/5aa15a409c7cb7f9ffbd870d8d228ca4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4a/753/325/b4a75332583a785745bae047f832279c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Official part </h4><br>  And then they called everyone into the hitherto closed hall, where the official part of the presentation began.  Some quite ordinary Stephen Elop and Stephen Ballmer appeared on the scene, they introduced each other, and then for a long time, and as always, the head of Microsoft spoke very actively, talking about all the advantages of the new mobile OS.  After it was replaced by Stephen Elop, who was sitting at the time of his colleague's speech on the sidelines with some kind of absolutely calm and even ordinary expression on his face.  During the Nokia CEO's performance, Ballmer was already standing aside and studying the guests standing in front of the stage.  Then they solemnly shook hands and with the red and yellow Lumia 920 for a minute they posed in front of cameras invited by cameras and smartphones. <br><br>  At this, the official part ended and Nokia and Microsoft employees came on the scene and showed and told the audience about the new mobile OSes, new Nokia flagship smartphones, as well as several applications for working with the camera.  At this, the official part was completed and in the hall several demo zones started to work, in which Nokia and Microsoft employees showed novelties to those who wanted it.  In one of the demo zones I recorded this video: <br><br>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHieiMHXd2eU">www.youtube.com/watch?v=HieiMHXd2eU</a> <br><br><h4>  Short test </h4><br>  At some point I was able to lend Lumia 920 for a while and, going out to the balcony with her, take a few pictures first on her and then on the Nokia 808 Pureview.  That's what happened as a result.  Installations in both cameras were automatic. <br><br>  Lumia 920: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/718/29d/46d/71829d46d492cf2abc0c6b6569859194.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nokia 808 Pureview: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/40f/0fd/049/40f0fd04992ab736bffc2844577804a0.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Lumia 920: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a58/23b/aac/a5823baaccf0bebd433fd918ad49b345.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Nokia 808 Pureview: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5fa/db3/d69/5fadb3d6933d02cc483271d83d9e4187.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I will not impose conclusions, but, as it seems to me, the 808 camera is not much inferior to 920 by sensitivity. I expect to check the rest of the camera parameters when I have a device for a longer time.  However, even without a detailed test, it‚Äôs obvious that, as a Lumia 920 smartphone, a few better heads than the 808. But I‚Äôd hardly change my N9 to Lumia 920 ... <br><br>  PS: all photos, except for those that are labeled in the test as Lumia 920, taken on the Nokia 808 Pureview!  I do not cease to admire this machine! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/157665/">https://habr.com/ru/post/157665/</a></p>
