      And all this in one phrase, separated by commas.  (in one word, with a small letter - it would be too pretentious, right?) <br><br>  <a href="http://msado.livejournal.com/1993863.html">I</a> don‚Äôt remember the <a href="http://msado.livejournal.com/1993863.html">text</a> about investors, everyone who doesn‚Äôt remember - can go reread, for transparency of the worldview ;-) <br><br>  I look and see the following picture: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Marketing in start-up projects is undervalued like hell.  Right critical.  Startups continue to believe that catching up traffic will be enough.  And on SMM-it.  The fact that the same fb got out just on the marketing component, and not on the functional, they ignore.  Why the project platform brand, they do not understand, and at the same time do not understand what the brand platform. <br><br>  (To be fair, a significant part of already-living companies also do not understand and is very surprised why the ceiling is so close) <br><br>  It usually turns out to be explained, but this is quite a lot of work for which there is usually no money.  As for meaningful advertising.  Soft threesome at home do realistically, the design is worse, with the rest of the program. <br><br>  2. The investor gave the first piece of money and forgot.  He ALREADY got a share, which means that, from his point of view, he can change the rules of the game.  And it begins, I will not give money until you do this, this and that, but the fact that it is garbage on vegetable oil - this is more clear to me what to do, I won what money I earned, even if they were inherited by my wife. <br><br>  And time is running out, the project was supposed to start being advertised yesterday, it was even watched by the first couple of thousands of people who came from Habr and Facebook, and somehow there was no time to argue, it was easier to bend over.  At this point, the project comes the final extinguish the light. <br><br>  3. And vice versa.  If the project has marketing, then the investor‚Äôs interest in it is definitely poher.  And the interest of a startup as an investor is also.  A start-up in general often forgets that he, stsuko, is also an investor.  And these are separate interests and a profession. <br><br>  So, traffic, registrations and even the notorious manifest are all cool, but for an investor it is hellishly important that the project look terribly cool.  Because it immediately reduces the risks.  If everything goes well with you and you raise millions - the coolness itself will, yes.  And if not?  And if not, then it would be better if you looked fucking awesome, but just haven't flown up yet.  Then he will sing beautiful songs to some investor easier and merge with minimal losses.  And to defend this interest of his generally speaking it would be necessary.  Because this is a chance to get a new investor and new money, and, which is also cool - YOU ARE ALSO INVESTOR, right?  Think for yourself. <br><br>  In short, the startup has no money for marketing - this is just an excellent path to the valley of death.  And it is realized very often there, inside. <br><br>  So here. <br><br>  A million rubles is not so much what amount, but in general many people are going to take 51% from a poor start-up for it and demand to return it in half a year with a turn.  Leaving yourself a stake, yes. <br><br>  It did not seem sensible to us and we found a financial partner who is ready to just lend our work.  The nominal amount is up to a million, but generally speaking under certain conditions it can be 2 and 3 million, depending on the details. <br><br>  This is certainly not a panacea and, strictly speaking, these are quite decent risks for the same startup.  But for my taste this is a good solution in several situations at once, some of which I have already written above. <br><br>  I will stupidly quote the zhzhshiechka, so as not to write it all again from scratch: <br><br>  - 1. For startups. <br><br>  1.a Make a pilot project without money is quite real.  2-3 people at the same time and the founders and performers, programmers, designers and all that.  But then, when the project is formally launched, all you can do is tell all your friends about the project on Facebook, LiveJournal and VKontakte.  And in general, everything.  Then you need money, and money with a certain minimum threshold, otherwise you will not dial the frequency (ask me what I do if you do not understand) and advertising will not work. <br><br>  Now you can come to us and everything will work out. <br><br>  1.b The investor does not live.  This happens, I have seen several cases directly when an investor, having received a seemingly share, forgets that he received it in exchange for obligations and begins to set additional requirements, saying that he will fulfill these obligations only when they are fulfilled and so on. .  And the project is worth it.  And time is ticking.  And this is blackmail, yes.  And it is not very clear how to fight without killing the project. <br><br>  Now you have a clear solution.  You start the campaign as you need, and with the investor you begin the process of returning his share, on the basis of unfulfilled obligations.  You have lost the subject of blackmail, you can cope without it.  Maybe in smaller amounts, so be it, but in any case, you have a tool to steal. <br><br>  2. Small business in a competitive surge. <br><br>  You have your own business, and you have missed the market a little.  Sales have risen, there is no money, and if not advertised, then everything will get worse and worse.  Every day. <br><br>  No problem, come.  A well-made advertising campaign will save you in most cases. <br><br>  3. Smeared budget. <br><br>  Basically, you have money for advertising.  The problem is that you do not have the entire budget at once, your turnover allows you to pull it out in a few weeks a little, and you should advertise now. <br><br>  Great, you are our client, the solution we have organized will allow you to start before you save up the necessary amount.  Right tomorrow, if that is critical. <br><br>  4. Underfinancing. <br><br>  We often encounter a situation where people really want to make a site with us, for example.  But they lack a little.  And they are forced to somehow cut their desires, we are spinning with them with some partial solutions. <br><br>  Now this is not necessarily so sad.  You can simply get the missing amount and all <br>  - In short, there is such a topic that giving a share is not always a good decision, sometimes it is easier to credit, especially at the finish line. <br><br>  Why do we have, and not take a loan from the bank?  Generally speaking, I do not claim it.  We will make several visits, and if I‚Äôm really sure that our financiers are making conditions better, easier and cheaper than going to the bank directly, I will say so.  So far this is not obvious to me.  But, nevertheless, I believe that we have made a good decision, which will be useful to many.  And it will be useless and even harmful for someone - I understand that very well too. <br><br>  So it goes. <br><br>  Do not forget to put a plus sign, iron and someone else will read and rejoice.  Or will rebel.  You never know chokak. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/137068/">https://habr.com/ru/post/137068/</a></p>
