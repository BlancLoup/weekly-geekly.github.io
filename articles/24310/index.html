According to some estimates, 1/4 of the published books on financial management in Japan are published in the Manga format and have an annual turnover of $ 2.4 billion. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.danpink.com/">Daniel H. Pink</a> built his reputation at the beginning of the 21st century by releasing 2 business books ‚ÄúFree Agent Nation‚Äù (2001) and ‚ÄúA Whole New Mind‚Äù (2005).  In a rapidly changing global economy, these books explore ways and give recommendations for those who seek to decide who he is in life, in a sense, encouraging a permanent change of job, joining different peer groups and much more, using the current term, we can say - analyze your ‚Äúsocial network‚Äù. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The Adventures of Johnny Bunko: The Last Masterpiece by Daniel H. Pink and Illustrator Rob Ten Pais, from <a href="http://www.mcad.edu/">Minneapolis College of Art and Design,</a> consists of 160 pages and only 35 words per page.  The <a href="http://www.penguin.com/">Penguin</a> publishing group published Mangu Johnny Bunko in the beginning of this month, with an initial print volume of 75,000 copies.  As the title suggests, the book acts as a guide to popularize your professional growth and career advancement, but only in the area that most closely matches your talent or passion.

      Meet <a href="http://www.johnnybunko.com/">Johnny Bunko</a> , a young office worker, or speaking plain Russian, <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD">office plankton</a> , which presses a chair against the floor of a certain Boggs corporation.  Johnny Bunko, of course, hates his job, feels that he is stuck in his development, he began to suspect that what he thought he knew was all just an illusion.  But cherishes hopes that he still manages to escape from this stupefying little world.  99%, that this story is about you.  You have already perfectly mastered the art of drinking coffee, sending faxes and answering phone calls, hanging around at Odnoklassniki and other dumb services.  Surely, like Johnny, many of you did everything that your parents, teachers, friends told you. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://socialtrend.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/johnnybunkopage.jpg" width="525" height="400"></a> <br><br>  But, one night, Johnny‚Äôs stinging, tough, wise, and beautiful professional consultant comes to the rescue ‚Äî Diana, from whom he learns, six basic rules that will help him competently lick and hit his CEO by preparing himself to start building his own company. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WtRNiMZsTro%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgy-KIyGHqOzx7CXf6vwz6k-H5Ziw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://socialtrend.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/johnnybunko-page5-300x229.jpg" width="250" height="160"></a> <br><br>  Six basic tips: <br>  1) There is no plan; <br>  2) Forget about your shortcomings; <br>  3) Perseverance conquers talent; <br>  4) All this is not yours, but the client; <br>  5) Make mistakes; <br>  6) Watch and memorize. <br><br><blockquote>  Most people have no idea about their future career.  Only athletes and artists are more or less definitely aware of their future, but even in their case, everything changes.  For the rest of us, change happens despite our good intentions and hopes in the opposite.  Published books about careers in the US are already coming out with outdated information.  Today the world is different.  Employment agencies and newspaper ads are no longer playing such a leading role as before, most people are looking for employment information on the Internet (Craigslist, CareerBuilder, Monster, etc.).  The reader will receive from the book that can not take out from the Internet and that eludes Google-ing. </blockquote><br><br>  The promotion of the book by Johnny Bunko is also given great attention.  Daniel H. Pink has planned a tour of colleges in cities such as Boston, Chicago, Baltimore, Seattle, Austin, where he will be giving interviews and negotiate.  Participation in the exhibition <a href="http://www.bookexpoamerica.com/">BookExpo America's</a> .  And of course, the promotion of the brand Johnny Bunko will occur through the sale of noodles of the same name.  Download 23 pages <a href="http://junogrove.com/Barb/JohnnyBunko23SAMPLE.pdf">PDF</a> . <br><br>  Many reputable Western publishers have long understood that readers need to provide information graphically, and in a format that the book can fit in a coat pocket, and the time to read does not exceed more than two hours. <br><br>  For example, the publisher Harvard Business Press, launched a series of <a href="http://discussionleader.harvardbusiness.org/ceomemo/">Memo</a> books <a href="http://discussionleader.harvardbusiness.org/ceomemo/">for the CEO</a> , each of which has no more than 125 pages.  And just Manga and comics in general, like nothing else, can best use the potential of literature without fiction, and are suitable for this purpose.  This is a very powerful communicative way to tell a story, bring a business idea or hand out tips on any topics to people who have a limited period of time to concentrate. <br><br>  via <a href="http://socialtrend.ru/johnny-bunko-vezuchij-i-upryamyj-ofisnyj-plankton/">Social Trend</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24310/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24310/</a></p>
