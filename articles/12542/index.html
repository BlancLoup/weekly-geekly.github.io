Combinators from moving ...</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Internet in Russia, as a business environment, has been developing very rapidly lately.  The possibility of the Internet draws attention to a large part of the business.  This causes the inflow of more and more money into the Internet industry in the form of investments in the creation and development of Internet resources working for business development, budgets for strengthening the positions of websites on the Internet and for Internet advertising. <br><br>  As it happens everywhere and always, where there are banknotes, there are also people who are looking for ways to get them without straining at all, often just misleading those who do not know the features and specifics of the Internet. <br><br>  Today we will try to talk about such "experts" who build their combinations on such a concept as website promotion (SEO) in search engine results.  This is true for many site owners, and considerable budgets are spent on such events. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, we want to warn everyone against falling into the hands of such pseudo-specialists, and we are also saddened by the fact that the negative experience of working with ‚Äúcombinators‚Äù simply hurts the reputation of these professionals.

      It all develops according to the old, proven scheme.  According to which the priests still mocked Adam Kozlevich and according to which the same fortune tellers and other ‚Äúshamans‚Äù, specializing in quick weaning of money from the ‚Äúvictim-client‚Äù, act. <br><br>  The number one challenge here is always to scare a potential ‚Äúclient-victim‚Äù.  For people ignorant, the spells go on the theme ‚Äúyou are not working properly ... tomorrow your site will disappear from Yandex ... only we can save you, but for this you must, of course, pay ..‚Äù.  Familiar, is not it?  Not everyone will realize that he is simply being deceived and, as they say, ‚Äúthey are well-behaved with money‚Äù, allegedly for an emergency rescue of the situation. <br><br>  There is no need to go far for examples.  Recently, a number of companies practicing ‚Äúshamanism‚Äù from the Internet have stepped up their activities in the search engine optimization market.  The clients of almost all the largest agencies of St. Petersburg fell under their blow. <br><br>  As a rule, ‚Äúochmurezh‚Äù is built according to the following scenario.  A pseudo-specialist calls the company's office with a story about terrible misfortunes that Yandex will soon bring down on the head of the unfortunate website owner (site ban, the disappearance of their search). <br><br>  And all allegedly due to the fact that I work with his website well, just creepy "non-professionals."  Speech on this topic plentifully gives away unambiguous lies against those who work with the owner of the site.  At the end of pretentious speech, naturally, the call should be ‚Äúsaved‚Äù with the help of the exceptional capabilities of the ‚Äúcombinators‚Äù, who alone in this world can correct the karma of the site and mend holes in it with their own ‚Äúcosmic‚Äù methods and spells. <br><br>  Moreover, some site owners are called by seven!  once a day, allegedly from different companies (although legal entities, as a rule, are really different), in the hope that if, like in that parable, a person is told several times that white is black, then he will begin to doubt himself and the correctness of their perception of the situation. <br><br>  The main calculation is naturally made on the fact that not everyone is well versed in the principles of search engines and, therefore, they can be impressed by a speech generously sprinkled with professional jargon ‚Äî indexing, a search robot, a ban, a citation index, etc.  However, few people realize that the set of terms of the ‚Äúcombinators‚Äù sometimes does not even have an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat they themselves mean. <br><br>  Each "combinator" learns the most simple "mantra" to which, in his opinion, the client-victim must surely bite.  One of these spells is getting into the cherished ten of Yandex.  Shamans on this topic, ‚Äúpseudo-specialists‚Äù do not even bother to check the real positions of the site (or maybe they just don‚Äôt know how?) And tell the site owner a long time about what benefits await him when they hit the top ten of the same Yandex.  While painting the sky with diamonds to the site owner, they do not even suspect that the site of the person to whom they paint paradise on the Internet has long been in this cherished top ten. <br><br>  It is of interest that the ‚Äúcombinators‚Äù really have a very vague idea about the technologies of website promotion.  Calling at random and anywhere, they sometimes get on people knowledgeable in these matters.  What really professional community thinks at the same time can be found, for example, on professional websites: <br><br>  <a href="http://forum.searchengines.ru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D153609">forum.searchengines.ru/showthread.php?t=153609</a> <br>  <a href="http://forum.searchengines.ru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D124607">forum.searchengines.ru/showthread.php?t=124607</a> <br>  <a href="http://forum.searchengines.ru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D124140">forum.searchengines.ru/showthread.php?t=124140</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.seowrite.ru/%3Fp%3D28">www.seowrite.ru/?p=28</a> <br>  <a href="http://spbpro.ru/showthread.php%3Ft%3D1008">spbpro.ru/showthread.php?t=1008</a> <br>  The list goes on and on, but even so much becomes clearer, isn't it? <br><br>  The complete incompetence of these "quasi-specialists" from the promotion can be easily seen by simply visiting their own websites.  Alas, of course, at first it is difficult for a non-professional to figure out exactly what to pay attention to.  But even with the slightest awareness of what is "website promotion" to understand this is easy. <br><br>  Let's take a closer look at how these people with a wise look are broadcasting that it is simply misleading the client victim and discrediting all those who are really professionally working on the path of website promotion (believe it‚Äôs not easy, and ‚Äúshamanism‚Äù) . <br><br>  So, on the website of one of the companies in question, it was written that the Citation Index is a key factor in ranking sites for issuing Yandex according to highly competitive words.  In fact, even newcomers to optimization know that the TCI is a fairly arbitrary value and affects only the position of the site in the Yandex.Catalog. <br><br>  On another site there is information that you can get into the database of a search engine on a paid basis, which is also a complete absurdity. <br><br>  Here are the main ‚Äúpearls‚Äù of unfortunate optimizers and shamans-promoters. <br><br>  1. Registering in directories and buying links can lead to a site ban. <br><br>  Registering in catalogs, as well as buying links, are not black / gray methods.  Accounting for external links is one of the fundamental principles for ranking the majority of search engines and, accordingly, does not entail any sanctions on their part. <br><br>  2. Soon, Yandex will change the algorithm and will no longer take into account external factors. <br><br>  To say in advance when Yandex will make the change of the algorithm, and especially, how to say what exactly the new algorithm will be - no one can, except the employees of Yandex. <br><br>  3. Remove the site from the ban is $ 5000. <br><br>  Ban (exclusion from the index) from the site can only be removed by correspondence with the Yandex support service, but not for money. <br><br>  If you only trust in such "specialists", then the effect of their work is simply unpredictable.  Well, if they do not cause much harm to the site and everything will result only in lost money and time.  True, the lost time will allow the competitor sites to become stronger, which is also a damage, because  in order to "catch up and overtake" will have to go to more substantial costs. <br><br>  Here are some simple tips that can help you communicate with "pseudo-specialists."  Dear site owners!  First of all, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with such an archival document as the License to use the Yandex search system (Yandex.ru) <a href="">rules.yandex.ru/termsofuse.xml</a> You can find all basic Yandex requirements here.  Do not violate them and there will be no sanctions from Yandex.  Professionals working in the field of website promotion know these rules as ‚Äúour Father‚Äù and strictly follow them.  After you become familiar with what Yandex regards as a violation, it will be much more difficult for ‚Äúcombinators‚Äù to continue their ‚Äúfoul play‚Äù. <br><br>  Find out from the caller - by what highly competitive inquiries the sites that his company deals with are already in the top 10 of Yandex. <br><br>  If you are told that in the near future, Yandex will have a change in the algorithm - ask where this information comes from? <br><br>  If it is claimed that registration in directories is a black optimization method and because of this the site can be excluded from the search engine index - ask to send a link to an authoritative website or an optimization textbook in which this information will be written. <br><br>  In the case of such calls: <br><br>  if you are already working with any company that professionally maintains your website: We recommend that you find out the following data: the company name, the name and surname of the caller, contact phone number, and then transfer this data to the agency with which you cooperate. <br><br>  If you have no experience of cooperation with any professional organization, take some time, make inquiries, ask for recommendations, ask to familiarize you with successful projects. <br><br>  Choosing a contractor for such an important component of online business, as the promotion of the site, be careful!  Remember that website promotion is an extremely important process and, if it is conducted poorly, it can lead to disastrous consequences.  Work with real professionals! <br><br>  Material prepared: <br>  Information and Consulting Center "Ladoga" </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/12542/">https://habr.com/ru/post/12542/</a></p>
