Having considered several offers on the Internet, I stopped at the proposal of DH 150r.  per month for (499). <br><br>  <i>1 day.</i>  I found a box with a fare, having traveled 4 Euroset salons.  All the necessary actions were taken in the salon, they said that the connection would work in a few hours. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>2 day.</i>  The phone did not work referring to the lack of funds in the account.  <b>1</b> call to Euroset, all questions in the CG, they said that it would take up to 3 days to activate the number, this is already a mismatch.  <b>2</b> calls to the central heating center were switched several times, they were told to call back in the evening, some kind of base had fallen off.  <b>3</b> call to the CT number promise to include, do not see the monthly fee.  <b>4</b> call to Euroset, where is the monthly fee?  We all listed, goodbye.  <b>5</b> call to DH, telling the whole story again, they offer to send a check by fax, in the absence of a fax at hand, I send you an email. <br><br>  <b>3 day.</b>  Oh happiness!  Phone earned.  Here I make a mistake, finally placing a number on the site.

      <b>4 day.</b>  Mastering the service, stumble upon the detail, it turns out they take off with me at 110p.  every day, taking off immediately for 3 days 330r.  <b>6</b> call to the CG, the body on the phone says that this is a fee for a subscriber number, and 150 rubles.  per month is the monthly fee for the room.  Having rummaged in words the body got confused and began to mumble, put the phone down so as not to injure the psyche any further.  <b>7</b> call to the CT, I'm lucky, I communicate with a more literate person.  He managed to find out that I had another subscription plan with a subscriber almost 30 times more!  They offered to write to the complaint department.  What a secret department does not have phones.  Wrote, attaching scan scan and contract scan.  For supposedly put 3 days. <br><br>  <i>5 day.</i>  In the evening I find that the phone did not work in the morning.  Having turned on the necessary tariff, I have to write off another 500 rubles.  besides 110r.  for the previous day, the debt reaches 1050r.  and the number is turned off.  <b>8</b> call in the CT, again telling the whole story first, then kicking along the line 5 times, each time having to check the mat, tell it all over again.  As a result, they asked to call back after 10:00 pm, the base fell again.  <b>9</b> call, again a story, again stupidity, no one needs anybody any more, they offer to write letters to the secret reclamation department.  Posted <br><br>  <i>6 day.</i>  Passed in vain.  4 calls to nothing lead.  Spent 3 hours a night. <br><br>  <i>7 day.</i>  <b>14</b> call, talked rudely, do not hesitate in expressions.  Gave a number, someone who can do something.  Half an hour of dialing, the number is dead.  <b>XX</b> call again the story on the raised tones, again a number, such as the one that before this is not the one, this more trump card.  <b>XX</b> call a trump number, gave the number VASSCHE STOPUDOVYY!  <b>XX</b> last call, the woman answered, told me tired and long, then hung on the phone for 5 minutes, promised that after 10 minutes everything would work.  Do not lie. <br><br>  I think not for nothing that he wrote. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/57479/">https://habr.com/ru/post/57479/</a></p>
