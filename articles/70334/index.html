  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Learning to lead - setting goals</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Working at executive positions for a certain time, I brought out for myself some criteria of a good and not very good manager, or even not a manager at all. <br>  For many, a management position is above all a salary increase, and no more.  But to be a good leader is not so easy. <br>  Responsibility greater than its employees is assigned to the head.  Decision-making.  Different protections, whether projects or budgets.  Different kind of reporting. <br>  But let's order. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <i>‚ÄúA successful person gets into the habit of doing things that losers do not like.</i>  <i>He may not like it either.</i>  <i>But he subordinates his feelings to the goal.</i>  <i>(Gray)</i> <br><br>  I will not describe the whole methodology of the leadership line, I will only tell you about the main points. <br><br>  A good leader must be able to correctly and well formulate a goal.  What is a well-formulated goal in my understanding:

      - Clear, clear, unambiguously interpreted. <br>  - Achievable, realizable. <br>  - Measurable degree of achievement. <br>  - Limited in time. <br>  - Approved and "charged" for achievement. <br>  - Is developing. <br>  - Implementation depends primarily on the subject of the goal. <br><br>  Having learned how to formulate a goal in front of your employees is no guarantee of success. <br>  The second point in the manual, you must correctly receive feedback from the employee.  Those.  in simple terms, you assign a task to an employee, he listens to you attentively, perhaps asks questions, you answer them, and at the end your employee should tell you what he ultimately understood from you, and you should already evaluate whether in his head on the picture was drawn, if everything is correct.  So it remains to be easy - to control the employee.  This whole art really is.  If you interfere too often with the work or your control seems too tough for the employee, the motivation to complete the task may come to naught, which of course is not desirable.  Therefore, after we have set the task, received feedback, we set the control points, i.e.  Those moments of time when we ourselves will check the progress of the task, or the employee himself will report.  In what form should be a report - you decide. <br><br>  At first glance, everything seems so simple.  But in any business there are pitfalls, and as nowhere in the manual, the so-called human factor most often works. <br><br>  If you are too hard of a leader, then the staff will surely be afraid of you, but behind your back will speak nasty things.  And most likely they will look for a new place of work.  If you are too soft, your credibility will simply drown in the eyes of your employees, they will simply understand that you, as a manager, are not worth anything.  In both cases, nothing good will come of it. <br>  Therefore, you need to learn to be in the middle, between a tough and loyal leader. <br><br>  But we have moved away from the topic. <br>  Any tasks can be divided into groups.  Eisenhower principle. <br><br>  Tasks are divided into four groups: <br><br>  1. Important, urgent <br>  2. It is important, not urgent. <br>  3. It does not matter urgently. <br>  4. No matter, not urgent. <br><br>  Let us consider each group separately, which tasks, which group we can put. <br><br>  1. Important, urgent - in this group are placed: <br><br>  - Crisis situations <br>  - urgent problems <br>  - Projects with a pending deadline <br>  - Hot issues <br><br>  2. Important, not urgent - in this group are placed: <br><br>  - Planning <br>  - Training <br>  - Relaxation <br>  - Prevention <br>  - SP Activity <br>  - Search for new features <br>  - Work with staff <br>  - Team building <br><br>  3. It does not matter, urgently - in this group are placed: <br><br>  - Turnover <br>  - Some phone calls, letters, meetings. <br>  - Reports <br>  - Some meetings, meetings. <br>  - Favorite affairs <br><br>  4. It does not matter, not urgently - in this group are placed: <br><br>  - Routine trivia <br>  - Some letters, calls, meetings <br>  - Idle and pleasant pastime <br><br>  How to use it? <br>  For myself, as for a manager, I started four trays, which I called: ‚Äúimportant urgently‚Äù, ‚Äúimportant, not urgent‚Äù, ‚ÄúNo important urgent‚Äù, ‚ÄúNot important, not urgent‚Äù.  And on small stickers, wrote tasks, and put them in trays according to their group.  And every day when I came to work, I first looked into the tray - ‚Äúit‚Äôs important urgently‚Äù and it worked exclusively when there were no stickers left in the tray, I switched to the second tray, etc. <br>  The most interesting point in this is that each time re-reading the stickers, some of them changed trays, from ‚Äúit is important not urgent‚Äù for example to ‚Äúimportant urgent‚Äù and vice versa. <br>  As practice shows, I just threw out stickers from the tray ‚Äúno matter not urgently,‚Äù once a month. <br>  In this mode, I achieved a 30% increase in the department‚Äôs performance, which is not a little, given the efforts I spent. <br><br>  Here dear habravchane, please do not judge strictly, this is my first topic, I hope not the last, in the future I plan to develop this topic, not only from the position of the head, but also from the position of the employee. <br>  Sound criticism is welcome. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70334/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70334/</a></p>
