The operator decided to present the most expensive on the facade of the giant pavilion in Sochi: the faces of its subscribers in the form of huge bas-reliefs of 6x8 meters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bf9/32e/ac2/bf932eac2be4de0b3000bda3ff843afd.jpg"><br>  <i>Olympiad with a <a href="http://faces2014.megafon.ru/">human face</a></i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  The MegaFon Pavilion in the Sochi Olympic Park is an interactive high-tech construction with dimensions of 25x25x15 m, one of the walls of which will be fully provided for installation in the form of successive 3D-models of human faces. </blockquote><br><h4>  Idea </h4><br>  The author of the project is the famous London designer Asif Khan.  One of his most famous works is the Coca-Cola pavilion project at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London ( <a href="http://www.dezeen.com/2012/07/20/coca-cola-beatbox-by-pernilla-asif-2/">The Beatbox Pavilion</a> ). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3c0/659/5b9/3c06595b9b43100f1982d35e59a14172.jpg">

      In life, he turned out to be the nicest person with whom I managed to have a word at the official presentation.  The task that faced him was to demonstrate a new level of openness and technology of the upcoming Olympics, achieved thanks to the capabilities of modern mobile Internet.  The experience acquired by MegaFon, including on <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/megafon/blog/190064/">providing telecommunications to the Universiade in Kazan</a> , makes it possible to call this event the <b>first social networking olympiad</b> - none of the previous Olympic games had such a level of mobile penetration on the one hand, and such demand for mobile Internet with another. <br><br>  According to Khan, he was looking for a way to express MegaFon‚Äôs mission - communication and transfer of emotions, and the company's innovative approach to business, which means dynamics and willingness to change.  The starting point was the emoticons - that is, smiles in our opinion - the easiest and not requiring translation method of transmitting emotions over a distance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d22/90a/6e4/d2290a6e4a450b263cf512491d6828c3.png"><br>  <i>In the MegaFon logo, Asif saw a smiley - and smiled</i> <br><br>  This led to the idea to make the main element of the design of the pavilion "MegaFon" the faces of real people - fans of the Olympics.  Khan compares his project with the famous Mount Rushmore in the United States: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/529/819/ba1/529819ba120ac48097c43d65b89098d0.jpg"><br><br>  Only if the American presidents are carved into the rock for centuries, then the special construction of the wall of the pavilion "MegaFon" allows you to represent more and more new faces during the entire time of the Olympic Games. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba7/b9b/24e/ba7b9b24e6555075533137c982bf5ab9.jpg"><br>  <i>Face to face: Asif Khan and his idea</i> <br><br><h4>  Technology </h4><br>  Having issued this idea, a Londoner turned to a Swiss digital company iart;  and they jointly came up with its embodiment.  For some specific tasks in the workflow, existing software from Agisoft and Coolux is used, but most of the software components for the system in iart have been developed specifically for this project. <br><br>  11,000 pistons, pulled out of the wall by electromotors, will create and modify embossed portraits of special fabric continuously.  For the installation of such a number of elements required a solution is not too heavy for the pavilion and quite simple to manufacture.  Examining a large number of different materials, the Swiss stopped on aluminum, from which the pistons for installation were made. <br><br>  Pistons are equipped with LEDs that allow you to make the image both white and color.  For the pavilion "MegaFon" stopped on a color variant of persons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8f2/390/525/8f23905255aa14a3288851b887293592.jpg"><br><br>  The coating material used is a mixture of 24% elastane, the most elastic fabric from the manufacturer of underwear, and 76% polyamide - industrial plastics.  Each 3D model that appears on the facade is processed according to an algorithm that ensures that the stretching of the fabric does not exceed 200% to prevent its rupture.  The total weight of the structure is 170 tons. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/596/c02/6b1/596c026b1dbdf59ad7d33426d72132bf.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  In total, 170,000 portraits of various people should be replaced during the Olympics on the facade of the MegaFon pavilion.  And this person can be every MegaFon subscriber. <br><br><h4>  How to get on the wall </h4><br>  Literally, from today around the country, photographic boxes specially made for this occasion, where any subscriber of the company can take a three-dimensional photo for a projection on a barrel in the Sochi Olympic Park, begin their tour. <br><br>  The procedure for shooting is no more difficult than an instant photo in automatic machines.  Before going inside, MegaFon‚Äôs staff will register you with faces2014.megafon.ru (FMO, phone number, mail).  The voting booth itself also looks like a tent of an instant photo: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/11d/ad9/254/11dad925467148577c4f766d530fcd48.jpg"><br><br>  Inside a small screen on which instructions appear, and touch-sensitive control buttons.  It is impossible to get confused: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12e/749/ba0/12e749ba095e648cb2ddf7f94da02306.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/176/cc3/00e/176cc300e070598728847c8f154e6688.jpg"><br><br>  There are three attempts to choose the most liked photo.  After sending it passes moderation (matching the size, the presence of interfering parts) and is added to your personal page on faces2014.megafon.ru.  On the passage of moderation and adding a photo the participant receives an SMS-notification. <br><br>  When photographing a participant, 5 cameras are used, on the basis of the image from which the three-dimensional model of his face is calculated.  At the same time, computing nodes perform the calculation of a set of such models, which are then transferred to the central network storage of data. <br><br>  The processing of the photo on the example of the famous skater Ivan Skobrev: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/619/175/1d7/6191751d7b94a6b5ea4e66ce22178cb6.gif"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/137/211/cb6/137211cb61aa2d90b8f0f1aefe5effb5.gif"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f70/e83/4f9/f70e834f9fb617e2bec875bc648d3a18.gif"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/598/f97/edb/598f97edb63c4bd7fca315d85a798698.gif"><br><br>  And here is the result on the wall of the pavilion: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc0/fcb/dd8/bc0fcbdd84ae5c9d9bd553f793d1ad2e.gif" alt="image"><br>  <i>Doesn't this <a href="">remind</a> you of anyone?</i> <br><br>  For the time being, this is only a layout - since the pavilion is still being built, and it will be fully ready in January.  At the same time, even those who will not go to the Olympics will be able to see their eight-meter profile on the facade of the megaphone pavilion in the Olympic Park: on January 28, 2014 the project participants will be sent information about the exact time of your portrait appearance on the facade, which you can watch live on the website faces2014.megafon.ru.  Also there will be available a 20-second video with this magical moment, and, of course, the opportunity to share it in social networks. <br><br>  And each registered participant of the promotion will be able to take part in the competition for <a href="http://faces2014.megafon.ru/">faces2014.megafon.ru</a> .  The three winners will first appear on the interactive facade of the pavilion and will be able to see it with their own eyes, since they will receive a trip to Sochi for the Olympic Games. <br><br>  Now the miracle booths are sent on a monthly tour of the country: it will be possible to use them in the offices of MegaFon by tracking dates on a schedule: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/730/097/80d/73009780dd8423e8890dc94a598cbc1c.jpg"><br><br>  - or on <a href="http://faces2014.megafon.ru/">faces2014.megafon.ru</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/646/edd/d26/646eddd2615f544315d334e2c18701b0.jpg"><br><br>  In Moscow it will be possible to catch booths <a href="http://faces2014.megafon.ru/contest/schedule">until December 6 in GUM, and until December 25 - in Gorky Park</a> .  Come on in! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/204046/">https://habr.com/ru/post/204046/</a></p>
