One of the key steps in this direction is the translation of the site into foreign languages.  In this post we will share with what it is worth starting localization, what to consider and what pitfalls to expect. <br><br>  According to the <a href="http://abbyy-ls.ru/csa_cant_read_wont_buy">international consumer purchasing preferences</a> survey conducted by <a href="http://www.commonsenseadvisory.com/">CSA</a> (the leading analytical organization in the market of linguistic services and technologies), the more fully the product is described in the client‚Äôs native language, the higher the probability that it will be bought. <br><br>  <b>Little about terms</b> <br>  Strictly speaking, sites are not translated, but localized.  Localization is not just a translation from one language to another.  This is a complex adaptation to the culture and realities of the market, as a result of which the texts on the website, graphics, multimedia, layout - everything looks as expected by the target audience.  That is why it is very important to take into account many nuances, including those that at first glance may seem insignificant.  For example, to think about the length of words in the target language (they are shorter in English than in Russian, and longer in German) at the interface design stage.  For example, the ‚Äúexit‚Äù and ‚Äúexit‚Äù are not so different, but the German ‚ÄúBeenden‚Äù and the Chinese ÈÄÄÂá∫ are already pulling the puzzle for interface designers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>The quality of the translation site</b> <br>  The site is the face of the company.  Users do not have the opportunity to try the product.  The attitude to it is born on the basis of UX and the perception of the text - informative, presentation style, literacy.

      There are two banal truths in the translation.  First, everybody - even exclusively qualified specialists - sometimes makes mistakes.  Secondly, if two people discuss the quality of the translation, they will definitely have different opinions.  Therefore, when localizing sites, the role of a formalized quality assessment system is very large, which takes into account the ‚Äúfrequency‚Äù and ‚Äúweight‚Äù of errors for a certain amount of text, and also calculates the final assessment. <br><br>  The evaluation process is as follows: the specialist studies the translation and fixes the errors in a special form, classifying them simultaneously.  After that, using a special formula, it calculates the ‚Äúquality index‚Äù in the range from 0 to 100. With a three-step technological scheme (translator, editor and proofreader) recommended for localizing websites, software and marketing materials, this indicator should be no less than 90. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28a/b77/77a/28ab7777aabd40e5806a8d3b0c97d969.png"></div><br><br>  <b>About artists</b> <br>  The first rule of localization: translators, editors and proofreaders must be native speakers of the target language, residing in the respective country.  At a minimum, at the stages of translation and editing it is crucial to involve carriers. <br><br>  The performer must know the specifics of a particular area.  The seller of coconuts on the Philippine beach is a native speaker of Tagalog, but hardly understands the device of telecommunications equipment.  Contact translators and editors who have the necessary experience.  They know the terminology, know the industry competitors, and are able to ask the right questions that can help you improve the site or product description. <br><br>  <b>How to prepare a site for localization</b> <br>  In the ideal case for localization you will need: <br>  - Terms of Reference for a localized version of the site, <br>  - the source of the site in a specific format (about this below), <br>  - terminological glossary (a list of key terms in the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof the original and translation), compiled by you alone or with the participation of the contractor, <br>  - well-established interaction with those who develop and maintain your site. <br><br>  If you apply to a translation company, then localization specialists will help you with the preparation, but in general, modern automation technologies allow you to independently build an efficient and cost-effective production process. <br><br>  <b>TK for translation</b> <br>  Basic TK describes what to translate, for which audience, into which languages, for what period and in what format the result is needed.  Since, based on it, the cost of translation is considered, decide which content you need to translate, and which not.  For example, it is possible to do without an archive of news over the past years: its localization can be expensive, while it will give far less advantage in the new market in all cases. <br><br>  Sometimes it's hard to separate the important from the unimportant - for example, if we are talking about large Internet resources and tens of thousands of pages accumulated over the years.  Translation companies in such cases analyze the site map, make a detailed calculation of the volume and cost of all sections and pages.  This report helps to understand where a lot of content has accumulated, and make an informed decision about what to translate, and without what you can do. <br><br>  <b>Sources</b> <br>  Having source files (html, xml, doc, xls, or others) simplifies and reduces the cost of localization, as well as saves strength and nerves - you are sure that the performers will not translate anything too much and will not forget anything. <br><br>  Throwing a link to your site with a note ‚Äútranslate to Wednesday‚Äù is not the most effective way to set a task, although it also works.  It is better to specify what exactly to translate, and give access to the CMS site so that the performers immediately work with the source files. <br><br>  Keep in touch with the localization team and discuss with them the key components of the project.  As a result, you get the files in the right format and encoding and easily embed them on the site.  Or it will be done by performers, if you agreed with them and gave access to the CMS. <br><br>  <b>Source Preparation Board</b> <br>  The performers translate faster and better if the source texts are written in a good language and are finished in terms of meaning.  So, give translators the final version of the text, which you will no longer rule on your side, since updating the source code slows down the process and leads to additional costs. <br><br>  <b>Site Chief</b> <br>  Contact with the team that created the site, understands its logic and is engaged in its support and content is very useful - it can be both full-time developers and third-party contractors.  Artists will be able to discuss with them issues arising in the localization process, clarify controversial issues and get access to linguistic testing (about it below). <br><br>  <b>As happens in life</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5f/f35/0e8/b5ff350e84804f868558df3d73bf0939.png" align="left" width="400" height="555">  Assume that deadlines are tight, translation is needed as soon as possible, but without compromising quality.  In this case, help modern technology.  For example, the <a href="http://www.smartcat.pro/">SmartCAT</a> solution helps to organize parallel work of several specialists: several translators can work on a project at the same time.  They will not interfere with each other: the technology will help each performer to reuse in real time what others or he himself has already translated.  The editor starts working without waiting for the project to be fully translated.  This helps to maintain the unity of terminology and style and accelerates the implementation of large projects several times. <br><br>  If there is no time or budget for a high-quality three-step translation (when a translator, editor and proofreader work on it), the regional partner for whom the translation is being prepared can help with reading: he understands the product.  In this case, you can make a translation without a media editor, but with a proofreading check to avoid typos, errors and other shortcomings. <br><br>  If you need to translate marketing texts to launch the product, we strongly recommend that you additionally use the rewriter editor.  He adapts the translated text and correctly places the accents.  Other works may be required: redrawing images, changing the page template, etc. <br><br>  We also advise you to do a <a href="http://abbyy-ls.ru/services/localization/brandchecking">linguistic verification of the brand name</a> .  It helps to find out whether the translated name of your company or product hides negative shades of meaning, because of which consumers in the new market will not want to buy your product and use your services.  In an amicable way, this should be done at the very beginning, when you only enter the market of this country.  But if suddenly you missed this stage, do not forget to do it even now. <br>  In our practice, there have been cases when, after checking in dozens of languages, it became clear that for some regions it was necessary to change the name.  For example, one brand bore the name of an animal - a hamster, which causes negative associations in the minds of Arab users. <br><br>  <b>Machine savings</b> <br>  Whether or not a machine translation stage is included in the localization depends on the complexity of the source code, budget, time margin and quality requirements for the result.  For example, if you need to translate a large array of the same type of information, and time and budget are limited.  Machine translation is often used by large e-commerce platforms where descriptions of thousands of products are placed and there is user-generated content (reviews, comments).  For them, this is justified: in the photo, buyers understand what kind of product they are offered, but often there are also sets of disjointed words. <br><br>  Machine translation is suitable in cases where the text is simple and unambiguous (suitable for large companies with a strong competitive advantage, when, for example, the low price of goods outweighs the quality of translation).  But for this technology is usually customized - they ‚Äútrain‚Äù a specific machine ‚Äúengine‚Äù for certain texts from a given area, adding accumulated glossaries and <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%258F%25E0%25EC%25DF%25F2%25FC_%25EF%25E5%25F0%25E5%25E2%25EE%25E4%25EE%25E2">translation memory</a> bases on the topic.  Then the editor works on the result of such a translation: in the industry, the process is called post-editing, and the specialist is called the editor. <br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://coub.com/embed/5ed0t%3Fautoplay%3Dtrue%26maxheight%3D315%26maxwidth%3D560%26muted%3Dtrue&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhK0o3Az4BUDA-cyW4EVGgj5TSxkA" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" autoplay="true" width="560" height="185"></iframe><br>  <i>Translator works with machine translation</i> <br><br>  <b>Linguistic Testing</b> <br>  This is the final stage of localization and an important component of quality control.  Localized files are uploaded to the site, then its screen behind the screen is reviewed by the expert tester according to the approved plan.  He evaluates translations in context, monitors that there is no truncated and untranslated text, studies the correctness of the display of fonts, additionally checks the text for grammatical correctness, recording all comments in a special form (bug report).  Further, the necessary edits are agreed with the customer and entered into the working files. <br><br>  Unfortunately, localization is usually needed ‚Äúyesterday‚Äù, so customers skip this step.  But, as practice shows, it saves a lot of time, which is then spent on additional edits and approvals, when it turns out that the button text does not go along the length, the font is displayed incorrectly, or the translation does not match the context. <br><br>  If the site is large, and time and budget are limited, we recommend linguistic testing at least selectively, highlighting the key pages.  Or do it on your side, if you have partners or acquaintances who know the product and know the language well. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/28b/87b/f36/28b87bf36f7f4cceb372becb896399d1.png" width="400" height="385"></div><br><br>  <b>What to do if the localization budget is small, but you still need to translate the site</b> <br>  Save on localization will help: <br><ul><li> Automation technology translation process.  A whole class of programs, CAT-tools (Computer-Aided Translation - automation systems for the translation process), help reuse previously translated words and phrases and facilitate the work of translators.  This is not a machine translation, but texts created by a person (professional translators).  CAT systems use cumulative translation memory and a project glossary.  It is important that translators use the most current linguistic resources.  For example, in the <a href="http://www.smartcat.pro/">SmartCAT</a> platform, they are immediately available to all participants in the process, which is especially valuable when several translators work in parallel on a large project. <br><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://coub.com/embed/5eamh%3Fautoplay%3Dtrue%26maxheight%3D315%26maxwidth%3D560%26muted%3Dtrue&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgbfgc5iD2am2VWDoRAK_--iYF6hg" allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" autoplay="true" width="560" height="224"></iframe><br>  <i>Parallel work of several translators on one text</i> <br></li><li>  Calculation of the cost of localization according to the original text.  The pieces of code and other service information will not be included in the statistics, and the cost of translation will not increase after it has been completed, which is sometimes what dishonest contractors suffer. </li><li>  The organization of work in parts.  If the site is large, contains many descriptions of products or services - break the work into stages.  First translate the most critical pages that will allow you to start attracting customers in the new market right now.  Gradually expand the volume of content as sales in this market grow.  This approach will also make it possible to gradually accumulate the translation memory, which means that all subsequent texts can be translated faster and cheaper, while maintaining the unity of terminology and style. </li></ul><br>  <b>And finally: what is not recommended when preparing the site for localization</b> <br>  These are the most basic recommendations, the list can be supplemented in each specific case, but it is also useful to get acquainted with them - both those who are already planning to localize their website in foreign languages, and those who are not going to new markets yet.  Not worth it: <br><ol><li>  Write long, ponderous phrases filled with participial and deactivated phrases.  Write easier, use verbs, do not contact users on "You", follow the <a href="http://siliconrus.com/2014/12/what-about-text/">precepts of Maxim Ilyakhov</a> . </li><li>  Use impersonal treatment.  In some languages, they are not used, as are additional forms of politeness.  So feel free to abandon them. </li><li>  Use one phrasing scheme for each language version of the site.  For example, for phrases with variables of the form ‚ÄúThere are X days left until the end of the subscription‚Äù.  In Russian, depending on the number, the case and the number will change: days, days, day.  In other languages, a preposition or phrase change may be required.  Both the placeholder and the colon matter: for example, in Turkish the phrase will begin with a number. </li></ol><br>  If we have forgotten something or you have your own secrets that have helped you successfully localize your site, write in the comments.  If you want to share your successful / unsuccessful experience of localization with the readers of Megamind - write too, let this post be the most useful for everyone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/290742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/290742/</a></p>
