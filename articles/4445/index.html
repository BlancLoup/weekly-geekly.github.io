  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet: audience, social network and community</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <font>1.</font> Let's try to complete the topic ‚Äúsocial networks and the Internet‚Äù, at least <br>  some intermediate result. <br>  <a href="http://internet.ru/columns/2006-08-14710">Initially,</a> our task was to define a web service intended <br>  to create, maintain and develop a social network.  I wanted to create <br>  theoretical model of a special entity in the Internet - ‚Äúsoc.  network on-line.  To view different <br>  applications of its use for example in <br>  <a href="http://wklim.ru/2006/08/16/meynstrim-v-poiske-20-ischem-ne-infomatsiyu-a-avtora/">social search</a> or in <br>  <a href="http://internet.ru/columns/2006-09-14709">collective</a> <a href="http://internet.ru/columns/2006-09-14709"><br></a>  <a href="http://internet.ru/columns/2006-09-14709">work</a> . <br>  As a result, those who responded to my definition, <br>  <a href="http://wklim.ru/2006/09/17/opredelenie-sotsialnoy-seti-redaktsii/">expressed</a> many of their formulations and descriptions of properties <br>  social network.  And all were convincing from their grounds.  But this <br>  the multiplicity only hid the subject of the study, rather than highlighted it. <br>  <a href="http://pat.iatp.ru/cgi/htconvert.pl%3Fberners-lee.txt">Tim Berners-Lee</a> <a href="http://pat.iatp.ru/cgi/htconvert.pl%3Fberners-lee.txt"><br></a>  <a href="http://pat.iatp.ru/cgi/htconvert.pl%3Fberners-lee.txt">about the Internet</a> : ‚ÄúThe Web will be so widely used that it can <br>  serve as a credible mirror of how we work, play and communicate (socialize) " <br><br>  Insofar as <br>  "Soc.  network on-line "there is <br>  reflection of the real social network and is secondary to it, then <br>  unsatisfactory attempts to define through the description of the properties of existing <br>  already available sites with the need <br>  leads us to consider the social network as real interactions of people in <br>  society. <br><br>  <font>2.</font> At the time of dialectical materialism widespread <br>  had the definition of a person, given by Aristotle not in "Metaphysics": <br>  "Man is a public animal."  Yes, we are all human, we are all human, and <br>  Therefore, we strive to unite with our own kind and separate from others.  it <br>  it is true, as it is true that it happens in a different way. <br>  As a subject of study, a ‚Äúsocial network‚Äù is being developed in <br>  sociology.  We will not go into the subtleties of disputes sociologists, they themselves admit <br>  what not <br>  came to a consensus, but let's take everything in common: a <b>social network is one</b> <b><br></b>  <b>of the types of relationships of people with each other,</b> called some <br>  researchers coordination. <b><br></b>  This type of relationship <b><br></b>  <b>differs from: 1) unrelated set</b> where there are no relations, and <b><br></b>  <b>2) a hierarchical organization</b> where control exists.  The network is not a group of unrelated people, but <br>  unlike hierarchical relations in a network there are no heads and subordinates, a network <br>  rests on personal desire, not on formal necessity and official <br>  responsibilities. <br>  It is worth noting as a certain multitude of people who are not <br>  the researcher himself identifies on some common basis (for example, drawing up <br>  outwardly marketers generalized portrait of the target audience).  Man is the only thing <br>  an animal that has an earlobe, but people are not humanity precisely because of this <br>  sign.  And from this fact it does not follow that everyone will buy earrings for themselves. <br>  <a href="http://pat.iatp.ru/htm-pat/18.html">Patarakin Evgeny Dmitrievich</a> <br>  : ‚ÄúPeople do not become a community because they look the same <br>  series ... For example, partners play at the table in <br>  cards, and the rest can discuss this game, but they can not at all <br>  influence.  Community of Practice ... denotes public education, <br>  whose members are involved in joint activities and communication is <br>  necessary condition for their cooperation. " <br>  In addition to these non-network forms of existence of a group of people, we find some <b>forms</b> <b><br></b>  <b>very similar to a social network: 1) an audience and 2) a community</b> .  In the first <br>  In this case, people are united by a common subject of their attention, but not among themselves.  In the second - <br>  the group not only enters into communication, discusses something, but also acts, i.e. <br>  the object of attention in this case becomes the subject of a collective application of forces. <br>  Interpersonal event in addition to communication in the community becomes - real <br>  joint activities in a common subject area.  But communication must <br>  be otherwise  when it is, but there is no communication - this is an organization where <br>  there is an order and execution. <br>  With the audience and the community, the social network has common features, but to <br>  it is necessary to distinguish it as an independent entity.  Such an <b>essential feature of a social network is communication</b> .  His (trait) <br>  presence distinguishes the network from the audience, and the exhaustiveness of the relationship to them <br>  distinguishes the network from the community where communication enters as needed but not <br>  sufficient sign. <br>  Here we come to the main thesis of the article: <b>social network -</b> <b><br></b>  <b>it is an unstable form of existence of a group of people between the audience and</b> <b><br></b>  <b>by the community</b> . <br>  The Internet, networked by nature, has become a must and <br>  nutrient medium for the entire network: from wires to consciousnesses.  Evolution <br>  The Internet as a cultural universal phenomenon is as follows: <br>  Internet audience (the Internet itself as an object of attention) joining the network <br>  interaction with each other (the Internet as a means of communication), finds <br>  a real common subject for the application of collective forces, forming <br>  real-virtual community (the Internet as a study).  And technology only <br>  drawn up to the pressing needs of consciousness, as can be used <br>  and for other purposes. <br>  The term ‚Äúsocial network‚Äù should be distinguished from another - ‚Äúnetwork community‚Äù: in <br>  The first connection is the goal, for the second - a means.  Social network can become <br>  network community, and may not be. <br>  Three phenomena: audience, social network and community correspond to three <br>  such as sites: library, community and office.  About this next time.
