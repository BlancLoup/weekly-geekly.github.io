Just try to find out whether Russian companies can get into this business? <br><br><h3>  A bit of history: the beginning of specialization </h3><br>  Initially, companies engaged in the manufacture of semiconductors, were created in accordance with the IDM model (integrated device manufacture, in Russian is closer within the meaning of "integrated manufacturer").  This means that the company itself is engaged in the development, production and sale of finished products.  The most striking example of the successful implementation of the IDM model is Intel, based on the dawn of the development of microelectronics as an industry. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The wide coverage of all stages of product manufacturing was due to the fact that at the initial stage of development of the electronic industry the general directions of development of technologies and end devices were not yet clearly defined.  Each company adjusted the technology and design (design) for their specific products. <br><br>  With the development of the industry and the standardization of technological processes, it has become possible to use technology for several manufacturers.  Some design rules (design) could be used for production at several factories.  An important step was the introduction of CAD (Computer Aided Design, or EDA in the West), which also allowed to develop (design), regardless of the manufacturer of semiconductors.

      Since the 80s, it has become possible the emergence of new business areas and relevant models of companies.  Fables companies (lack of own semiconductor manufacturing facilities) were engaged in the production of final products, placing orders from external manufacturers.  The rejection of the complex and expensive production of semiconductors allowed fabless companies to avoid large capital expenditures, and focus on the development of final products.  One of the clearest examples is the company Xilinx (USA), founded in 1984.  The company began only to develop (design) and sell integrated circuits (specialization in FPGA \ FGPA types) circuits, placing production at third-party semiconductor plants.  Fables - companies can have various specializations and activities (design, packaging, commercial electronics assembly). <br><br>  And finally, in the second half of the 80s, companies specializing in customized semiconductor manufacturing began to appear, and foundry ‚Äî companies. <br><br>  Foundry companies, as a rule, do not engage in design (design), concentrating on the manufacture of plates and testing of the resulting product. <br><br>  The advantage of foundry is that it sells power for manufacturing, and the customer of integrated circuits (a fabless company) may not be afraid that the foundry will start selling products on the market independently.  Foundry can adjust and improve the technology to the needs of the customer, can also offer flexible conditions in terms of production volumes and timing.  The advantage of the foundry of companies over IDM is a more optimal management of production business processes, which allows us to offer a lower cost of manufacturing plates.  Foundry - manufacturers that mainly focus on custom-made semiconductors are called pure-play foundry. <br><br>  The most striking example of pure-play is TSMC (Taiwan), founded in 1987.  The company was originally created under the custom manufacturing of semiconductors. <br><br>  Of course, there is no absolute separation.  When they talk about attributing a company to a particular model, it‚Äôs rather a matter of building a business model as a whole.  Companies can combine different business models, varying over time with each component.  Moreover, companies can also temporarily ‚Äúplay‚Äù those other roles in relation to each other. <br><br>  For example, Samsung Electronics (one of the main companies in the Samsung conglomerate) is an IDM company.  But at the same time, Samsung Electronics is a foundry company and offers itself for custom manufacturing of wafers using SOI technology up to 14nm (1).  In particular, for IDM of the company STM (France-Italy) Samsung is one of the suppliers of plates (2).  Samsung is also foundry in relation to the firm Apple, making schemes for it. <br><br><h3>  Players in the Foundry market: a small cake and not equal to all </h3><br>  The total world sales of integrated circuits and components in 2014 amounted to more than 300 billion dollars.  (3).  These are the total sales of IDM, fabless and foundry companies.  If you look at sales of only foundry - companies for 2013, then it amounts to $ 42 billion (it also includes 3 IDM companies that provided services in the direction of foundry).  The 13 companies in the TOP-list cover about 91% (or 38.9 billion dollars) of the total foundry market. <br><br>  The everlasting giant of foundry services, TSMC, has reached $ 19.85 billion, which is half of the total market.  TSMC offers customers the most advanced technological processes, up to 10nm, and at an affordable price.  An alternative to advanced technologies - only Samsung, which also begins to play in the market foundry services.  Although Intel is a recognized technology leader, it is not yet an active player in custom manufacturing semiconductors.  But the company is beginning to look closely at this business: in 2015, the company announced the direction of foundry services, and announced several customers, such as Altera (today, a division of Intel), Achronix Semiconductor, Tabula (defunct), Netronome, Microsemi and Panasonic (7).  It can be expected that in the next few years there will be some redistribution of the market between technological IDM giants and leading foundry companies. <br><br>  6 leading companies (TSMC, GF, UMC, SMIC, Samsung, Powerchip) showed sales of over a billion dollars.  per year, and in total it is more than $ 31 billion, or almost 75% (4).  The technological level of these companies allows them to get access to the most profitable orders, they have no competitors.  They remove the main ‚Äúcream‚Äù of the market in the range of technologies from 45nm and below (this is more than half of the semiconductor market in monetary terms). <br><br>  On all others, there are only 11 billion dollars.  How do other companies do business and due to what have they not yet fallen victim to TSMC pressure? <br><br>  Consider a few foundry - companies whose annual turnover is less than $ 1 billion. <br><br>  Conditionally foundry ‚Äì companies can be divided into two types.  The first are ‚Äúold players‚Äù who have been on the market for foundry services for more than a decade.  Typically, these companies have the level of technology from 130nm and above, and offer typical processes with various specialized options (high voltage, analog). <br><br>  VIS (Taiwan), X-Fab (Germany), Tower Jazz (Israel), Dongbu HiTek (South Korea), AMS (Austria), Integral (Belarus), HHGrace (China) can be attributed to the first type. <br><br>  The second type is the ‚Äúnew wave‚Äù companies that have entered the market relatively recently, and some of them offer new technologies that classical foundry companies cannot offer (primarily MEMS, Optronics).  The most famous examples are Teledyne DALSA (Canada), MEMSCAP (France), LETI (France), IHP (Germany), IMEC (Belgium). <br><br>  The large IDM companies that also want to play on the foundry market stand apart (for example, Samsung, which has already been mentioned). <br><br>  All types of foundry companies make money in two main ways.  The first is the sale of capacities for the manufacture of plates for the customer.  The cost of the plate depends on the volume of the order (the more - the cheaper), the timeline for loading the productions by time (one-time order or long-term multiple), the terms of order execution (urgent or not), the level of technology (the ‚Äúthinner‚Äù the technical process is - the more expensive the plate ).  At present, the cost of the manufactured plate with a diameter of 300 mm using the CMOS 28nm technology is about 6 thousand dollars.  (eight).  Over time, as the supply of new technologies, the cost of the plate on existing technologies decreases. <br><br>  The second source is the sale of space in MPW (Multi Project Wafer).  Not everyone needs a separate set of photo masks for individual use (small design centers, universities, the need for a small number of samples).  In addition, when launching pilot projects, especially in the case of ASIC and analog applications, there is a risk that the project will have to be redone, and these are additional expenses, and considerable ones (a set of photo masks for 65nm technology costs about $ 1 million) (9) .  In these cases, the foundry offers customers to buy only part of the area on the photomask, it turns out that the purchases are ‚Äúchipped‚Äù.  The area for placing working projects on a photo mask is about 30 x 20 mm (depending on the service information of the factory itself).  Customers are offered a minimum area (usually from 2mm2).  After the batch of plates is removed (‚Äúshuttle‚Äù), the customer receives the agreed number of crystals (possibly a plate).  The cost of the area depends on the level of technology.  For example, UMS (Taiwan) offers, using 180nm technology (MOS RF), a minimum area of ‚Äã‚Äã5x5mm at a price of about 16 thousand euro (data from 2016).  AMS offers a price of about 1,300 euros using 180nm technology (CMOS HV) (the minimum area is 7 mm2).  (10.11).  Source - EUROPRACTICE. <br><br>  The ratio of profits from mass orders of plates and "shuttle" differs from company to company.  In particular, TSMC plans to launch in 2016 approximately 100 different technological options for approximately one batch (‚Äúshuttle‚Äù) per month.  If you take the maximum number of plates in a batch of 25 pieces, it turns out about 30 thousand.  plates per year (1200 ‚Äúshuttle‚Äù per year x 25pl).  On the background of the total TSMC capacity of approximately 9 million plates per year (equivalent to 300 mm diameter plates) 30 thousand.  plates is less than 1%. <br><br>  In other companies (especially small ones), the share of MPW may be greater, but the number of launches of the shuttle itself will be much smaller (compared to TSMC).  In particular, at X-FAB (judging by the launch schedule) in 2016, an average of one launch of the shuttle is scheduled each month.  This is about 300 plates per year (against the background of the company's capacity of 72 thousand plates per month, equivalent to 200mm plates).  This is about 1% (not much more than TSMC). <br><br><h3>  Classic foundry companies from the "past" century </h3><br><h4>  VIS: Under the wing of TSMC </h4><br>  Vanguard International Semiconductor Corporation (VIS) (Taiwan) was founded in 1994 in the famous Hsinchu Science Park (Taiwan Silicon Valley).  Initially, the company focused on the production of DRAM memory.  Production capacity was about 170 thousand.  pl \ month with a diameter of 200mm.  But as a manufacturer of DRAM memory, the company did not go into business, and in 1999 the company began to be involved by TSMC as a co-executor of orders (TSMC is one of the company's investors).  In 2000, the company officially transformed from a DRAM manufacturer with a foundry company.  In 2007, the company acquired the production facilities of Winbond (Taiwan). <br>  Today the company employs about 4,700 people, the annual turnover of the company (2013) is about $ 713 million.  The level of technology from 1 micron to 0.15 micron.  Capacity - about 110 thousand.  plates per month (6).  Development per person about 151 thousand.  Doll <br>  Specialization - high-voltage technology expressed (High Voltage, Ultra High Voltage, Bipolar CMOS DMOS (BCD), Discrete, SOI (Silicon on Insulator), Logic, Mixed-Signal, Analog, High Precision Analog, and Embedded.).  (five) <br>  We can say that TSMC uses this company to place orders for low-end technologies (HV-processes) in order to free up its capacity to produce more mass orders. <br><br><h4>  X-FaB (Germany): Gradually and slowly </h4><br>  Historically, the company maintains its lineage from a semiconductor "plant" in the city of Erfurt since the GDR (the headquarters are now located there). <br>  The main owner of the company (61% of the shares) is the Belgian Xtrion NV (formerly a subsidiary of the Belgian Elex NV).  The number of employees is about 2500 people worldwide. <br>  At present, the company's revenue is about 330 million dollars (2014).  The total capacity of 5 production lines (3 in Germany, one in Malaysia and one in the USA) makes it possible to produce about 72 thousand pl / month (equivalent to a diameter of 200 mm).  The plant in Sarawak (Malaysia) brings the company more than half of its total revenue ($ 180 million). (13) <br>  Production per person per year - 132 thousand dollars. <br>  X-Fab has technology from 1 micron to 0.13 micron, and specializes in the manufacture of analog and digital-analog circuits (analog \ mixed - signal).  The company offers HV, BCMOS technology, as well as SOI (silicon-on-insulator).  In early 2016, the company announced a process based on SiC technology. <br>  X-Fab also offers custom MEMS products (14).  The company also offers its capacity for continuous production (outsourcing), by transferring technology from another fab to its own.  The site has information that over the past 15 years, the company has thus transferred 60 technologies under 30 specific customer products (15).  X-Fab focuses on the automotive sector, military, medical - where a low percentage of failures and increased requirements under operating conditions are required. <br>  The company has a local design center in Voronezh and a representative office, Microdesign (16), for subsequent manufacture based on X-FAB facilities.  Domestic design centers also use X-FAB to make their designs.  In particular, Zelenograd ‚ÄúMilandr‚Äù indicated X-FAB as a manufacturer of digital-analog circuits (17). <br>  This is one of the direct competitors of the domestic foundry-direction both in terms of technology (Micron up to 65nm, starting Angstrem-T up to 90nm), and in potential applications (military and public sector). <br><br><h4>  Dongbu HiTek - find yourself </h4><br>  In 2013, the company was in the top ten of the pure-play foundry by annual revenue (570 million dollars). <br>  Dongbu HiTek (included in the Dongbu South Korean chaebol with a turnover of about $ 30 billion, (2014). (18). <br>  In the 90s, the company tried to find itself in a niche of GaAs and DRAM-memory, but without success.  Currently positioning itself as a pure-play foundry (so far the only one in South Korea). <br>  The company has two factories (both located in South Korea), with a total capacity of about 96 thousand.  PL \ month (equivalent to a diameter of 200mm).  The level of technology is from 90nm to 0.35¬µm.  Types of technologies - digital CMOS, analog CMOS, HV, BiCMOS (for LED drivers), BCD, Flash, CMOS sensors (CIS), RF options. <br>  Development per person (about 2 thousand workers) - about 285 thousand.  Doll. <br>  About 13% of the company's revenue for 2013 came from the Chinese market (Dongbu has several representative offices in China), due to orders from fabless companies.  Korea‚Äôs giant domestic market provides companies with only about 40% of revenue, and most customers are small and medium (all large ones use foreign foundry). <br>  At the beginning of 2015, the Chinese foundry-company SMIC showed an interest in purchasing Dongbu (19) amid the difficult financial situation of the company (the company had a loan payment of more than 200 million dollars in 2014). <br><br><h4>  Tower Jazz - active promotion </h4><br>  The company was founded in 1993 (originally Tower Semiconductor), with the involvement of technology from the American company National Semiconductor.  Thus, the first line of the company in Israel. <br>  In 2008, as a result of the merger, the company acquired the production facilities of the Jazz Semiconductor company in California (200mm line), changing its name to Tower Jazz. <br>  In 2014, a new company (joint venture) was organized in cooperation with Panasonic - TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Co.  (TPSCo).  51% of the shares of the new company belong to Tower Jazz, 49% - Panasonic.  Thus, at the disposal of the new company, 3 semiconductor manufactures in Japan became available, from 45nm to 0.35¬µm.  The mission of the new company is to gain access to the market of Japan (and Asia) for making orders for IDM and Fabless companies.  In essence, this is a bold attempt to occupy the niche of the foundry destinations in Japan. <br>  In 2016, the company acquired production facilities in Texas (USA). <br>  Today, the company has 4 factories, 2 in Israel and two 2 in the USA. <br>  3 manufactures in Japan (as part of TPSCo) are also available for the company. <br>  The total capacity (including TPSCo) for the production of plates is about 800 thousand pl / year (equivalent to a diameter of 200mm).  The company's annual turnover is about $ 500 million.  The number of employees is about 4.5 thousand people.  Production per person per year - about 111 thousand dollars. <br>  The level of technology (including TPSCo) is from 45nm to 0.35¬µm.  The company offers the production of analog circuits, BiCMOS and SIGe BiCMOS, RF options, SOI-technologies, HV and BCD, sensors.  Tower is actively promoting SiGe technology (SiGe Terabit Platform targeting high-speed wireline communications for the terabit age). (20) <br>  The company has more than 300 customers worldwide, including such well-known circuit manufacturers (IDM and fabless), such as Samsung, TI, Avago, International Rectifier.  Tower also offers services for the transfer of production to its facilities, as well as the adjustment of existing processes to the goals of the customer. <br>  The company is also engaged in technology transfer (transfer) commissioned by other companies.  In 2010, the company promoted one Asian company in launching and debugging technology on the production line, the amount of the contract was about $ 100 million. <br><br><h3>  2000s: new wave players </h3><br><h4>  TELEDYNE DALSA (Canada) </h4><br>  Initially, the company was called DALSA (formed in 1980), and was focused on the development and creation of CCD (Charge-Coupled Device, or Charge Coupled Device, CCD) and CMOS sensors.  On the basis of these devices could receive the image. <br>  At the beginning of the 80s there was a period of active development and commercialization of this technology - in the year 89, CCD sensors were used in 97% of all cameras. <br>  In 2006, the company (mainly as an IDM manufacturer) showed revenue of $ 186 million.  with the number of workers about 1000 people.  (21).  At that time, the company had at its disposal production facilities of CMOS and MEMS technologies (75, 100 and 150 mm diameter plates). <br>  In 2012, DALSA became a part (absorbed) by Teledyne Technologies, a large US technology conglomerate (revenue for 2010 was about 1.5 billion dollars), which, among other things, was engaged in the development and manufacture of digital image devices. <br>  The new company became known as TELEDYNE DALSA.  The merger benefited - the company's revenue in 2012 was already 2.1 billion dollars (22).  The updated company focused on two business areas - as an IDM manufacturer, manufacturing of finished products (digital image) and custom manufacturing services for MEMS products (sensors) in a pure-play model.  The main profit comes from the IDM direction - sales in the digital image segment amounted to about 400 million dollars.  in 2014 (23). <br>  The volume of sales of the foundry directions in 2014 amounted to about 35 million dollars.  This is the 4th place in a word ranking of pure-play foundry MEMS directions.  In the first place is STM, with a turnover of MEMS products at 158 ‚Äã‚Äãmillion dollars. <br>  The main market is the Asia-Pacific region (43%).  97% of the total revenue the company receives from exports (only 3% comes from the Canadian market).  In addition to commercial applications, the company supplies its products to the military and space sector.  In particular, DALSA CCD sensors were used in the Spirit and Opportunity Mars Rovers in 2004, and in 2012 in Curiosity. <br><br><h4>  LETI (France), IHP (Germany), IMEC (Belgium) </h4><br>  Ten years ago, these research centers were engaged in semiconductor research, development of new technologies and devices.  And today they provide custom plate manufacturing services.  In europractice and in the MOSIS system, IHP plates (SiGE BJT technology, photodiodes), LETI (photonics), IMEC (photonics) (24,25) plates can be ordered. <br>  Foundry-direction is not static and is constantly changing, adjusting to the situation in the global market.  Someone changes the business model from IDM to foundry, some combine both directions.  Second-tier companies (with annual turnover of up to about 500 million dollars) are forced to flexibly ‚Äúmaneuver‚Äù in the market, in search of niches or under the wing of a large company.  The main markets for such companies are Southeast Asia (even the volume of developed countries is not enough for companies). <br>  Giants such as Samsung and Intel are also looking towards the foundry (Samsung is already active).  Even research centers have embarked on the ‚Äúpath‚Äù of custom manufacturing. <br><br><h3>  Domestic foundry-landscape </h3><br>  In the spaces of the former USSR, the main players of the foundry-direction (current and future) can be counted on one hand‚Äôs fingers. <br>  Belarusian Integral supplies most of its products in the form of schemes for export, including to Russia.  The company both sells ready-made diagrams and products (both an IDM company) and offers customized plate manufacturing (foundry).  The company has three technological lines (100,150 and 200mm).  Integral offers technology levels from 0.8 micron (plate diameter 100 and 150 mm), CMOS, BiCMOP, HV, DMOS. <br>  The company‚Äôs RoadMap has plans to develop 0.18 (200mm) and 65nm (300mm) (26) technology. <br>  The company's revenue for 2015 was less than 100 million dollars.  It‚Äôs impossible to say exactly which direction was received from the foundry ‚Äî there is no open information.  On the example of other companies (Dalsa) it can be assumed that no more than 20%. <br>  Zelenograd "Micron" in its corporate presentation designates itself as an IDM semiconductor manufacturer, mainly in the RFID direction (27).  10% of revenue comes from export schemes (revenue for 2013 amounted to more than 300 million dollars).  At the same time, the company also offers foundry services (the level of technology is up to 65nm, power - 3000pl \ month with a diameter of 200mm).  At the end of April, the company announced new plans to set up production at 55-45nm, at the expense of a loan raised from VEB, 11 billion rubles (33) <br>  Famous Russian fables-companies (design centers) reported on the use of "Micron" for the manufacture of plates.  In particular, "MCST" reported on the order of a small trial batch of microprocessors "Elbrus-2SM" using 90nm technology (28).  "Milandr" and "Elvis" also use "Micron" for the manufacture of schemes. <br>  But again, the presentation shows that Micron sees its development mainly as an IDM company. <br>  There is no open information on the foundry share - there is no direction, it can be assumed that the contribution is small (no more than 20%), by analogy with other mixed IDM \ Foundry companies. <br>  Perhaps, with the appointment of a new head of the company (Gulnara Shamilyevna Khasyanova, Gennady Yakovlevich Krasnikova replaced as CEO of NIIME and Micron OJSC) did the company change something in its strategy? <br>  The most ambitious foundry-project is the launching large plant of the company Angstrem-T (part of the Angstrom group of companies).<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The company is positioning the core business model as a pure-play foundry. Capacity - up to 15 thousand. Month \ month, the level of technology - up to 90nm (29). The project started back in 2007 (financing - VEB loan in the amount of more than 800 million euros), but the start of production was constantly postponed (the last announcement was for April 2016). In early August, after a visit to the enterprise of Dmitry Medvedev, the plant received permission from the Moscow State Construction Control Service to commission the facility. This means that from August of this year, the company can produce, sell products and conduct full-fledged commercial activities. But the real output should be expected no earlier than the end of 2016.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The Russian market cannot ensure the sale of such a number of plates (by the example of foreign companies), and the company does not name potential customers. But at the beginning of 2016, the Angstrom parent company announced its own chip for smart cards (including, potentially, for the cards of the Mir system). Angstrom offers capacities (Angstrem-T) for the production of this crystal (30). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Relatively recently, a new player has appeared - the Moscow company Crocus Nanoelectronics. The company was created as an IDM manufacturer of MRAM memory schemes in 2011 (the main investor of Rosnano announced the amount of investments of 100 million dollars, the total investment of about 300 million dollars). After several years, there is no available and open information on the company's MRAM schemes (customers, volumes, product specifications).</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Today, Crocus also offers contract manufacturing of 200 and 300mm plates, BEOL-parts of the route (without a transistor structure, which is a significant limitation) using technology up to 65nm (31). Power 2000-4000pl \ month. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the end of April in the press it was reported that Micron was considering the possibility of buying the Crocus. The reason, according to the source, is that the state of the asset is not simple. The same source reported on the "pricing" of the company "Angstrom" to "Crocus" (32). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That the coming year is preparing for us ... </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At present, the foundry direction is developed rather weakly in Russia, the export foundry direction is developed very weakly (the internal volume of the market is very small).</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But as you can see, the beginning of the year is quite rich in news about the possible development of the domestic foundry direction. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">By the end of the year, the Angstrem-T line will be launched (to a great extent), and the company's future strategy will be clearer.</font></font><br><br><h3><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Possible development scenarios foundry </font></font></h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Based on the above examples, we can assume the foundry development scenarios. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Let's start with the initial conditions:</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 1. Who are the customers and what is the domestic market? </font></font></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The commercial market is small, customers are few. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is possible to estimate the foundry market domestically at about 5-10% of the finished semiconductor components (circuits) market (about $ 2 billion). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It turns out about 100-200 million dollars. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is for all players and for all types of schemes for all technologies. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In reality, it is possible to cover about 10-20% of this amount. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">We get from 10 to 40 million dollars. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This is not something for several companies - one is not enough. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(you can find fault with such an assessment, but if you know better, I will be glad to see it). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And in the near future we should not expect a miracle. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Therefore, the initially pure foundry of the company must be oriented towards the western (or rather, eastern) market.</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 2. Access to investments </font></font></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">With the reduction of investments in general from abroad, as well as taking into account oil prices, you can forget about private investments of several hundred million dollars. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In the foreseeable future, we should not expect improvement. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There remains the state (or VEB, which is essentially the same), which is already lacking.</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 3. Some limitations on technology and materials </font></font></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Maybe it will be better, but in the near future it will not become much easier. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Rather, it deters potential foreign customers and investors.</font></font><br><br><h4><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Scenarios "domestic foundry" </font></font></h4><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 1. To independently enter the foreign foundry - the market and "fight" with competitors </font></font></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Example: GF company (they were acquired by an Arab foundation, in order to start building a fab in the country). </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plus: real market entry. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Minus: given the lack of long-term and large foreign investments (like Arabic money from the GF) - it‚Äôs no use starting. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Only if you buy a fab abroad, register a company abroad, and find a foreign investor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And after about twenty years to build a fab number at last in Russia. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">True, the "domestic" in such a company will be very small. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The probability of success of implementation: extremely low</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 2. Find a "patron": some large enough company (options are possible - foundry, fabless, IDM), which will use the capacity to accommodate part of their orders (expansion) </font></font></h5><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Example: VIS </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Plus: no need to fight with sharks, just calmly do what the ‚Äúpatron‚Äù will introduce, the problem of investment has been partially solved, the finished market. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Minus: ‚Äúpatron‚Äù will require partial financial and managerial control (complete absorption is possible), some (or some) loss of independence. </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Probability of implementation success: medium (companies are constantly expanding in the search for new suitable production facilities).</font></font><br><br><h5><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> 3. Mixed options (1 and 2) </font></font></h5><br><br><h3>  Sources </h3><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(1) </font></font><a
