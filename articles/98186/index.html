You must agree, because 10 years ago no one dared to dream of such speeds, and even more so about wireless options for connecting to the Internet.  But now he has come so tightly into our life that we do not pay attention to him and cannot but use him.  What is it for?  To the fact that the Internet has given us completely new features that everyone now uses. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Agree, because everyone has happened - promising yourself that you will sit for only a few minutes on the Internet, you were dragged in there by your watch.  All these news, articles, blogs and other joys of the Internet are dragging people down, pinching them tightly with their digital tentacles and preventing them from leaving. <br><br>  Today we can see many different social networks that allow us to be in touch at any time.  The same networks drag us down so that a person just lives on the Internet for days and becomes addicted to it.  Many may say that social networks are evil, but let's think about the benefits they can bring to us.

      First, when mentioning social networks, ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù or ‚ÄúVkontakte‚Äù comes to mind, it all depends on where you live, although now most people use both services, which is really true, I am also among them ... What is added to our life these networks?  Obviously, they help us to find acquaintances or to make new acquaintances.  Moreover, they can be used as storage for a photo or video and share all this good with others.  For example, abroad, many are simply dependent on Facebook, update their status every half hour and communicate only there.  I use it as one of the methods to connect with friends, since we do not have city lines in the city (or rather, they exist, but in a slightly different form than we are used to) and communication is carried out only via cellular communication.  Yes, and free Wi-Fi almost everywhere plays a significant role in this.  It is very useful when chat, and messages are available on the Internet using social.  network.  Many have questions about privacy in relation to these services, now more and more information about a person is concentrated in his profile, so the issue of privacy is becoming more acute. <br><br>  I believe that the well-known Twitter can be a good answer for this.  It would seem that short messages are not very useful, but now this service is wildly popular.  How is he comfortable?  Not least the role played by the notorious privacy - you can choose who will read your messages, and you need a lot less information to create a profile on Twitter.  Another caveat - I often use Twitter because of its simplicity and convenience.  It is much easier for me to quickly write on Twitter than to write on soap. <br><br>  Do not consider this an advertisement, just wanted to describe your opinion about this phenomenon - social networks.  I would also like to hear your opinion on this topic, do you often use it, do they bring some benefit, or vice versa, only harm and eat up precious time? <habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98186/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98186/</a></p>
