  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Corporate immunity: we create a system of centralized management of network security in the company and its branches</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The rules of the game have changed.  Yesterday we specialized in solutions for small and medium-sized businesses, and not due to the fact that we had any technical limitations, but only because the market was dominated by heavyweights in the IT industry.  Our software was simply not viewed by corporations as a comprehensive security solution, although they installed Traffic Inspector to protect individual offices and small units. <br><br>  But since the middle of 2014, due to changes in market conditions and sanctions policies of Western companies, our office has increasingly received requests for the possibility of combining our software and hardware devices into a single solution for corporations.  As a result, we have developed a new product, Traffic Inspector Enterprise - a comprehensive security system for an extensive network running a single console. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/smart_soft/blog/265495/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a20/0db/bac/a200dbbac6ef499aa5e917006b95f7c0.jpg"></a>

      So how did we come to this? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Companies with an extensive network require centralized management of network resources.  We received such a request from our long-standing client.  Solving this problem in trivial ways with the help of our 12-year developments in the field of information security was not possible.  But at the same time, it is forbidden to say ‚Äúno‚Äù to our company in our company - for 10 years we have the ‚ÄúHealthy denial of the impossible‚Äù rule. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0c5aa5">Conditions of the problem</font> </h2><br>  A large enterprise with a distributed branch network needs a set of tools that, together with centralized management, will allow monitoring the network security of remote offices and increasing the efficiency of the staff with Internet access.  At the same time, the system should be simple and quickly mastered by a new operator, follow the same safety rules, be controlled from the head office and solve a number of applied tasks: <br><br><ul><li>  distribution of Internet traffic between users; </li><li>  monitoring the effective work of users on the web; </li><li>  comprehensive protection against viruses and other external threats; </li><li>  generating reports at the request of the parent organization. </li></ul><br>  As the basic elements of the system, we used time-tested modules based on Traffic Inspector and supplemented them with a central console, which is installed at the head office of the enterprise and allows you to distribute security policies to network gateways (located in branches and provide protection and control of network security at remote locations). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/84d/8b0/f81/84d8b0f81a2e9f34da8e3f8d9a152c34.jpg"></div><br><br><h2>  <font color="#0c5aa5">Central management console</font> </h2><br>  The management console is a key component of the system, which is installed in the main office.  Below is a screenshot of the settings for connecting the child server to the managing "brain" when working with the central console: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/bc1/a29/2e9/bc1a292e9c47ddb419314409616c441f.jpg"></div><br><br>  Navigation is very convenient.  For example, this is the list of remote servers of a distributed network: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/66e/7c6/f59/66e7c6f59d6cc18e1af08db2663a8fb1.png"></div><br><br>  The assignment of a certain group of users to the company's servers is as follows: <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9be/097/a8d/9be097a8d59ca364f2c9f497ce99ccf1.png"></div><br><br>  It took us 3 months to implement the prototype.  We created a system that united the branch network of the enterprise into a single security complex, which made it possible to solve all the tasks set by the client.  Below is a little more detail about the main features of <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/products/ti-enterprise/">Traffic Inspector Enterprise</a> . <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0c5aa5">Main features</font> </h2><br>  Using Traffic Inspector Enterprise, you can set up centralized management of users on your corporate network: <br>  You will be able to transmit information between the head office and branches and collect all statistics on users' work on the web in one place. <br><br>  The program provides wide opportunities for centralized distribution of policy for remote branches from the head office. <br><br><ul><li>  Managing user access to the Internet allows you to limit the speed of groups and individual users, as well as set rules for allowing and denying access to resources according to the following parameters: <br><br>  - Lists of IP addresses and / or domain names <br>  - URL lists written using regular expressions <br>  - Contents of web pages <br>  - Type of information (text, media, etc.) <br>  - Resource categories <br><br></li><li>  Transfer to the remote offices of the created objects to configure user access.  These include: <br><br>  - IP networks; <br>  - URL lists; <br>  - Content categories; <br>  - Lists of ports; <br><br></li><li>  Distribution of firewall rules defining allowed and denied connections established through the gateway; </li><li>  Transferring SMTP gateway settings; </li><li>  Transfer proxy settings. </li></ul><br>  The central office can also collect and store various information, including: <br><br><ul><li>  Detailed network statistics on users, user groups.  This includes the analysis of resources visited by users, and data on content filtering and blocked requests; </li><li>  Monitoring the network activity of users of all branches in real time; </li><li>  Storing network statistics for all branches in an external database at the head office. </li></ul><br>  <b>Additional "buns"</b> <br><br>  In addition, useful minor functions are available for the client, which ensure the safety of work on the network and increase employee productivity: <br><br><ul><li>  Protection against viruses spread through the Internet at the stage of passage through the gateway; </li><li>  Spam protection.  Blocking junk mail during the passage through the gateway; </li><li>  Block banners, online advertising, pop-up windows in users' browsers. </li></ul><br>  Bandwidth support: up to 500 Mbps <br>  Support up to 8000 users on the LAN <br><br>  Each client has its own tasks: someone needs control of Internet access, someone needs centralized management, someone needs everything at once.  The advantages of our software solution in its versatility.  It as a constructor consists of reliable and time-tested elements, from which you can create any system for centralized management of network security for a specific request of our client.  We are ready to conduct an online demonstration of Traffic Inspector Enterprise.  To do this, you need to fill out a <a href="http://www.smart-soft.ru/ru/products/TI-Enterprise/">small form</a> on our website. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention, we are ready to answer your questions in the comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265495/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265495/</a></p>
