But we still will tell about 15 successful cases of using push-notifications by Russian sites and groups in social networks. <br><br>  All cases are real.  The information was provided by the guys from <a href="https://pushall.ru/">Pushall</a> (Service, which allows you to receive push notifications both in the browser and on mobile platforms. Notifications can be received even from groups in Vkontakte). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/507/45e/bf5/50745ebf5e3e439b8c1cf58001d9c99d.jpg">

      Before describing the cases, I would like to clarify the situation with push notifications.  The fact is that they are different.  And not everyone understands the difference between them (I myself have been driving into this topic for a long time, but finally figured it out).  And, having run into ‚Äúclean‚Äù push notifications several times, many simply hated this tool.  Yes it's true. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Let's understand the concepts.</b> <br><br>  ‚ÄúClean‚Äù push notifications are such a tough thing.  I went to the main page of the site, and I was almost forced to subscribe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ca/8b8/ec0/5ca8b8ec05dd478e8344a3546279e378.png"><br><br>  I close it, turn to another page, and then the ‚Äúinvasion‚Äù of my personal life continues: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5b/873/8a6/b5b8738a6fc645d094627a3d64b78b12.png"><br><br>  And such a tin goes on forever.  If I click ‚ÄúBlock‚Äù, then this thing will not appear on the site anymore.  And even if I want to subscribe to push-notifications from this site (when I understand that there is useful info on it), I can‚Äôt do it anyway. <br><br><h4>  What is the disadvantage of using ‚Äúclean‚Äù push notifications: </h4><br><br><ul><li>  They are wildly intrusive.  They are the first thing that greets you on the site and pursues until you block them. </li><li>  They are uninformative and incomprehensible.  This is what I can understand from the text ‚ÄúThe Site Requests Permission to Show Alerts‚Äù.  What are the alerts?  How often?  Alerts about what?  Why do they need me?  Many questions and no answer. </li><li>  It is very difficult to unsubscribe from them when a frank spam starts coming to you through the ‚Äúguns‚Äù.  It‚Äôs difficult because you don‚Äôt even know what it is and where to find the Disable / Unsubscribe button.  Some, not knowing how to turn them off, simply discard all browser data and automatically unsubscribe from all other (possibly useful) subscriptions. </li><li>  The problem of unsubscribing is aggravated by the fact that in different browsers and on different devices the process of rejecting such push notifications is arranged differently. </li></ul><br><br>  Here they are, these push-notifications that no one likes, and some even hate.  They spoil the whole impression of the new tool for interacting with users. <br><br>  But the notifications are completely different.  For example, the guys from Pushall make it so that the notifications do not cause hate attacks.  The user has full control of push notifications. <br><br><h4>  How notification control is achieved </h4><br><br><ol><li>  The subscription process is not due to the endless appearance of the ‚ÄúAllow notifications‚Äù window, but by the user‚Äôs request, by installing an extension (plug-in) for the browser or using the Push API (the thing described above, only the request appears when the user wants it) or on other devices by other methods. </li><li>  There is a catalog of all subscriptions and the ability to disable any subscription in one click. </li><li>  It is possible in one click to remove the extension and completely get rid of alerts. </li><li>  It is possible to filter notifications.  Want to receive notifications from the site only on a specific topic - no problem. </li></ol><br><br>  <b>People like to keep everything under control.</b>  <b>And they do not like it when the opposite situation occurs, which is characteristic of ‚Äúclean‚Äù push notifications.</b> <br><br>  Here is an example of the proper use of push notifications: <br><br>  &lt;img src = " <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a6/344/2c3/7a63442c385044d8bc909d6cf7f30ffa.png">  "alt =" image "/&gt; <br><br>  This is the site sohabr.net, which aggregates the information with Habrhabr, Geektimes and Megamozg.  When the user understands that the site he liked, it contains useful information, he presses the button "Subscribe", where he is offered various options for obtaining information.  Push notifications are one of the options.  The user clicks on it and goes to the subscription page: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8d/9b4/64e/a8d9b464e1f24926bffc6f2b30ca200a.png"><br><br>  Everything is simple, unobtrusive and convenient for the visitor.  According to Oleg Karnaukhov (co-founder Pushall), only 10% of users use Push API to receive alerts, that is, even with the inclusion of a button, for people this method is quite inconvenient, and it is easier for them to install an extension for the browser or even use Telegram. <br><br>  <b>Now you feel the difference between correct and incorrect notifications?</b> <br><br>  And do not be so biased with this tool.  Do not like it - do not subscribe.  But at the same time, there will be a considerable number of people who will find this option more convenient than E-mail distribution, tracking updates on social networks, etc. <br><br>  <i>Article in topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/e-mail-marketing/anatomiya-triggernyx-email-rassylok-ves-instrument-za-7-minut/">Bleed E-mail marketing: trigger mailings</a></i> <br><br>  Let us turn to the Russian cases from various fields of activity.  Let's start with online media. <br><br><h4>  Cases Online Media </h4><br><br>  1. Consider the same example of <a href="https://pushall.ru/%3Ffs%3D129">Sohabra</a> , which aggregates information from three sites at once.  At the time of this writing, 260 people were signed to it (although when Oleg threw off my information on cases, there were only 200 people).  With an audience of 200 people, 1,800 alerts were sent daily.  The audience is growing, not decreasing - this suggests that push notifications are convenient for the target audience. <br><br>  The site sohabr.net is directly integrated with Pushall through the API, so when a new article appears, the subscriber immediately receives a notification.  And due to the use of filters, everyone adjusts the flow of notifications to fit their needs. <br>  Conveniently?  Conveniently! <br><br>  2. The unofficial <a href="https://pushall.ru/%3Ffs%3D208">channel site w3bsit3-dns.com</a> .  More than 200 people receive alerts on new news from w3bsit3-dns.com. <br><br>  3. Semi-official <a href="https://pushall.ru/meduza">channel site meduza.io</a> .  Created by official representatives, however, they have not yet unwound it, and have not informed their audience about it.  Medusa passively gained 60 subscribers. <br><br>  4. <a href="https://pushall.ru/rusbase">The official channel of an</a> independent publication about startups - Rusbase.vc.  So far, the channel of push-notifications is practically not being promoted, but even people are gradually subscribing to it.  Now there are already 30 subscribers who receive daily alerts about new articles. <br>  5. <a href="https://pushall.ru/%3Ffs%3D566">The official channel of the</a> site Finanalize.com is a completely new channel, but it very quickly grew to 200 subscribers.  This happened at the expense of E-mail newsletters with the proposal to subscribe to a new channel for receiving information.  It would seem, but why another source of alerts?  But this makes sense: the channel notifies of the trading signals, and does it for free.  For readers of the site - this is important information.  And the speed of its delivery is important <br>  . <br>  6 / And here is the negative case of the same intrusive Iguides.ru (at the beginning of the article I checked their perseverance).  Therefore, the Internet appears questions like How to disable push notifications Chrome from iGuides?  And iGuides itself had to write a whole guide on how to turn off these notifications: there were too many discontented people.  The following is a confirmation of my words: <br><br>  &lt;img src = " <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d09/a3b/e5e/d09a3be5ecbc4f25b6a7d28557592668.png">  "alt =" image "/&gt; <br><br>  Comments in the article show that several days after work, users wanted to turn off notifications ... but did not know how.  And this caused a squall of negativity.  And some comments gained dozens of advantages, which reflected the opinion of site visitors and the ineffectiveness of ‚Äúclean‚Äù push notifications. <br><br>  In general, Pushall has 50 different thematic online media channels that were created quite recently and are just beginning to use this communication tool with the target audience. <br><br>  <a href="https://pushall.ru/%3Ffs%3D672">The channel of our site</a> - <a href="http://boosta.ru/">Boosta.ru</a> - was created yesterday.  And soon I will start actively promoting it for my readers.  Then I will definitely write a positive (I hope so) or a negative case of using ‚Äúguns‚Äù.  In the meantime, <a href="https://pushall.ru/%3Ffs%3D672">subscribe to it</a> .  Alerts will come no more than 2 times a week when new articles are published. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/various/push-uvedomleniya-novyj-kanal-kommunikacii-s-celevoj-auditoriej/">Push-notifications - a new [communication channel] with a target audience</a></i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Case studies studios that translate serials</b> </h4><br><br>  In Russia, they love foreign TV shows and are constantly waiting for the voice of new series.  A number of studios are responsible for the voice acting, there are many of them and among them there are quite large ones with many thousands of audience.  The problem is that there is no exact timetable for the release of voice acting, so users do not know when the new translated episode of their favorite series will be released. <br><br>  And in this case, the notifications were very helpful.  <b>The studio has translated a new series - the subscriber immediately found out about it and went to watch / download it</b> .  At the same time, some studios do not even have their own site, and those that do have no HTTPS, therefore, they cannot use classic (clear) push notifications (since Push API needs HTTPS to work) <br><br>  There are several such studios in the Pushall channel catalog.  Some of them were created by official representatives of companies, some had to be added informally - all for the sake of the user. <br><br>  1. <a href="https://pushall.ru/baibako">Baibako</a> is a large studio, it translates a lot of TV shows and works very closely with its audience.  They are probably distinguished by the best voice acting Doctor Who.  All fans of the doctor, watching the voice only from Baibako. <br>  Now they are signed by 1 995 people.  And the number of notifications per day sometimes exceeds 10,000. Already after 2-5 seconds after sending out, dozens of viewers go to download the voice acting of their favorite series. <br><br>  2. <a href="https://pushall.ru/lostfilm">Lostfilm.ru</a> is the largest studio in the CIS.  The channel was created informally, as it was not possible to reach an agreement with the company's representatives.  But almost 1,600 people subscribed to this channel, and the daily number of alerts is more than 5,000. <br><br>  3. <a href="https://pushall.ru/%3Ffs%3D37">NewStudio</a> - the official channel of another studio.  1,400 people were signed to it, despite the fact that company representatives practically do not advertise push notifications for satay visitors.  The daily number of alerts is more than 3000. <br><br>  The service has many more interesting channels on TV shows (about 20-30 different), for example Jaskier Studio - their voice acting is usually true without any censorship (by the way, their alerts are automated through their VK group).  Or TeamTardis - they were able to gather more than 300 fans of the Doctor who.  They use push notifications when a new episode is released in the original and translated subtitles. <br><br>  Perhaps some of you have a question: ‚ÄúHow do they gain subscribers base, if they do not use‚Äú clean ‚Äùpush-notifications when entering the site?‚Äù.  Further two examples from the guys from Baibako: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f46/453/809/f464538095b54136943bfeeb43056496.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01a/57d/32f/01a57d32ffb8442aa6ccdbfb5c631d88.png"><br><br>  That is how they tell their target audience about the availability of push-notifications.  And it is through such posts that they are encouraged to subscribe to their channel.  This is convenient both for the studio itself and for the ardent lovers of TV series. <br><br>  <i>Article in the topic - <a href="http://boosta.ru/various/push-uvedomleniya-novyj-kanal-kommunikacii-s-celevoj-auditoriej/">Foreign cases of using push-notifications + tips and common errors</a></i> <br><br><h4>  <b>Cases from the world of eSports</b> </h4><br><br>  Projects in the field of Cybersport are another area in which push notifications can soon receive the status of ‚Äúmust-have‚Äù.  Further some examples: <br><br>  1. Hellraises.pro - use ‚Äúclean‚Äù push notifications (intrusive notifications).  Like iGuides, only they also use an additional layer from another site, so turning off their alerts will be even more difficult.  After the subscription is not at all clear whether it works or not.  And it is unclear how to turn it off in case of anything.  There is no statistics, how many subscribers and what is the effectiveness.  The guys chose the wrong strategy "guns".  Nevertheless, this is one of the examples of the use of notifications in eSports. <br><br>  2. Cybersport commentator Vladimir Maelstorm Kuzminov.  Professional commentator Dota 2. Comments on the games as part of StormStudio, and is also the annual official commentator for The International. <br>  He cannot fully promote his channel, as StormStudio is deciding where to use the alerts.  However, now he has attracted more than 60 people and informs them about important e-sports news, the beginning of important games and his own stream. <br>  Many gamers are waiting for matches, and it is important for them to find out when they will begin.  Push notifications solve the problem of awareness.  Therefore, if users are aware of the possibility of receiving notifications, the channel will quickly gain popularity.  Matches on average watch 50 thousand people every day!  And as a rule it is a regular audience. <br><br>  3. Only_smiles - a streamer girl playing Hearthstone.  In just a couple of months of streams, she learned to play at a high level and recruited more than 120 fan subscribers.  All subscribers receive alerts so that they do not miss the stream on Twitch.tv. <br><br>  4. Blazya also plays in Hearthstone.  He was immediately interested in the opportunity to notify his audience.  He spends quite charged streams at different times and it is important not to miss their beginning.  At the moment he has only 21 subscribers. <br><br>  5. 105TV - stream by ARMA.  59 people are now subscribed to their channel. <br><br>  The use of push notifications in the eSports field is just beginning to develop.  Those who are among the first to start using push-notifications in this area will receive a new and very convenient channel of interaction with the target audience. <br><br><h4>  <b>Personal alerts from sites</b> </h4><br><br>  In this category there will be services that notify their users directly through the API.  The service PushAll more than a hundred personal hidden channels, among which there are many channels for internal CRM to coordinate the work of employees.  We cannot write about most of them in this article.  But let's give a few examples: <br><br>  1. Ooo.company - SaaS solution for business automation.  PushAll has built enough flexibly into its system, and now it is impossible to miss any important notification from the service. <br>  At the moment, the activity of their channel is weak, and it can be assessed, rather as a concept.  They even wrote an article about the development and operation of the system with notifications. <br>  2. Onliner.IO - an interesting service that provides monitoring of the social network VK.  He has convenient statistics of visits by time, analysis of musical preferences and can tell you when you can meet a person on the network most often, and how much time he ‚Äúburns‚Äù on a social network. <br>  Push notifications are used to receive alerts when a person enters a site.  If you cannot catch someone online, such push notifications are an interesting and effective solution.  The recipient of the message will be surprised if, 10 seconds after logging in to VK, he will receive a message from you. <br>  3. Freeloot is a new generation freelance exchange.  They are still conducting integration for their innovative task manager, through which it will be possible to receive notifications about order responses and the appearance of a new job for a freelancer. <br>  You can also instantly notify the freelancer and customer of new events, and, therefore, the process of interaction will become more efficient. <br><br><h4>  <b>Still, push notifications are not just user annoyance?</b> </h4><br><br>  Notifications are not so terrible.  The problem with hatred for them is caused by ‚Äúclean‚Äù and intrusive push-alerts and companies that are not good through alerts, but only spam.  So you should not completely write off this communication tool with the audience. <br>  Proper use of push notifications can be very convenient and effective.  And nobody restricts you in use cases.  Do you want to notify about the release of the new series - no problem.  Want to notify about a new article - no problem.  Want to notify about new orders on the freelance exchange - no problem. <br><br>  <b>The most important thing is to do it wisely. The user should be aware of how he will receive notifications, how often and where he can unsubscribe from them.</b>  <b>The user must have a choice of where to receive alerts - in the browser or directly to Telegrams, for example.</b> <br><br>  In many ways, all these questions are solved by the <a href="http://pushall.ru/">Pushall</a> service, which provided information for this article. <br><br>  PushAll is constantly growing the number of supported platforms, devices and channels.  There are more than 58 channels in the catalog with more than 10 subscribers. And 18 channels with more than 100 subscribers. This is more than the number of sites in the network that have implemented pure Push API notifications that only Chrome and Safari support. <br><br>  You also need to take into account that according to the statistics of PushAll - about 80% of users receive notifications through installed add-ons (extension / plugin) in Chrome or Android applications, 10% receive via Telegram.  And only 10% receive alerts using Push API (alerts without installing add-ons), apparently negative experience with this type of alerts affects the motivation to use this method. <br><br>  Prepared by <a href="http://pushall.ru/">Pushall.ru by the</a> blog <a href="http://boosta.ru/">Boosta.ru</a> and the project <a href="http://www.changeagain.me/ru/">Changeagain.me</a> <br><br>  Read also our other popular articles: <br><br>  1. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19126/">They will help you find all the conversion killers - 10 reports in Google Analytics</a> (6000+ views) <br>  2. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19542/">100 ideas for A / B testing.</a>  <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19542/">Part One</a> (2500+ views) <br>  3. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19548/">100 ideas for A / B testing: Part Two</a> (1500+ views) <br>  4. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/19686/">How to find an idea for an A / B test: heat maps and polls</a> (1000+ views) <br>  5. <a href="http://megamozg.ru/company/changeagain/blog/20258/">Get to know your target audience or die: 34 vital questions</a> (2000+ views) <br>  6.
