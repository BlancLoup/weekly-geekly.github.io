Travel agencies are generally closed in batches.  No one thinks about people: many are fired, and even more will be fired in the first half of 2009.  The rest will cut wages.  Experts of the Ministry of Economic Development believe that the first to be hit will be employees of the financial sector, trade, services and information technology.

      Forecasts disappointing.  But <em>‚Äúthe devastation is not in the closet, but in the heads‚Äù</em> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ul><li>  In the minds of those who believed in stability when working ‚Äúon uncle‚Äù: they lost this stability, and now they will have to rely only on themselves and their decisions. </li><li>  In the minds of those who failed to rationally rebuild the company: the money goes through all the gaps, and attention to the issues of effective planning becomes the main factor of survival. </li><li>  In the heads of those who, because of their distrust, destroy business partners: they squeeze goods, slow down transactions, raise prices - and you and your employees suffer from it. </li></ul><br><br>  Today is the best time to finally change.  And this concerns not only the attitude towards risky lending or stable wages: first of all this concerns the attitude towards life and business itself. <br><br>  After all, a crisis is a time for small and flexible;  too flexible to die, but smart enough to understand the importance of the moment.  This is the best time for freelancers and aspiring businessmen.  Remember the 90s - and those who made a fortune at this particular time ... <br><br>  The crisis hits the sore point - the wallet, and the person loses confidence in life.  But for some reason, there are always those who meet the next problems with a smile on their face, anticipating new opportunities: they are ready for changes and know what to do.  Are you one of these people?  Not?  Then we will pull you by the hair out of the swamp and teach you to see the hidden possibilities of this life! <br><br>  For when else, if not now? <br><br>  Meet: <br>  <b>Coworking club ‚ÄúTower‚Äù,</b> <b><br></b>  <b>with the assistance of all participants, current and former *,</b> <b><br></b>  <b>runs for ‚Äúsmall and free‚Äù</b> <b><br></b>  <b>project ‚ÄúPolygon‚Äù.</b> <br>  * and also with the approval and support of Bank24.ru <br><br>  (Unfortunately, the project is limited to Yekaterinburg and the region, but we are ready to support morally and intellectually, if there are enthusiasts in other cities) <br><br>  <strong>Idea:</strong> <br>  ‚ÄúPolygon‚Äù is a kind of training ground for young entrepreneurs: a ‚Äúsandbox‚Äù where you can dig, experiment, analyze results and save experience.  The idea and the person are tested for strength here.  But - with minimal risk, without fear of losing everything because of one stupid mistake. <br><br>  <strong>Your benefit:</strong> <br>  We, as organizers, guarantee participants that we will be able to protect them from total failure, as well as provide support and training.  For those who are just starting, it means reducing the starting (most dangerous) risks.  For those who are already operating, this means a reduction in the ‚Äúprice of error‚Äù: excessive expenses for renting premises, advertising, searching for partners or employees.  And if expenses are less - incomes are more! <br><br>  <strong>How we guarantee it:</strong> <br>  We will provide the participant with a business minimum: equipped jobs, a ready legal entity with an accountant and a lawyer, experience and connections of former and current participants.  If you wish, you can use our base of ideas (containing the experience of the development of about 30 projects).  It is recommended to be included in the collective solution of complex problems - to obtain new knowledge. <br><br>  No expenses for which the participant will go in the process, will not take away from him this minimum.  No solution passed through the experience filter of those who have already traveled this path will be approved if it is truly dangerous.  And only if you do not accept, contrary to the advice of everyone else, such a decision is at your own risk and risk - we guarantee that everything will work out for you. <br><br>  <strong>Format:</strong> <br><ul><li>  Commanders and chiefs will not.  We position ourselves as investors: do not lead, but provide support. </li><li>  Freedom of opinion and thought is welcomed.  The less frames you put yourself, the more options you get. </li><li>  Plagiarism and business theft are excluded.  It is not profitable for us, because we will have to go into details, waste time, and other participants will suffer.  The rest is unprofitable, because those who could be profitable, we do not accept. </li></ul><br><br>  <strong>Our benefit:</strong> <br>  At the stage of ‚ÄúPolygon‚Äù we do not get any profit from you.  All these 3 (6, 12 - how many are needed) months we just help to grow, we invest strength and knowledge.  But after starting your business, when you are ready to leave the sandbox and grow independently, you decide: do you agree to further partnership?  And if you see a benefit in this - we connect more closely and develop the project by joint efforts, receiving a share in the future company. <br><br>  The share is discussed, but not less than 15% and not more than 75%. <br><br>  <strong>‚ÄúPolygon‚Äù is a living confirmation of the fact that someone dies during a crisis, and someone gets on his feet.</strong> <br><br>  Get connected! <br><br>  (Contacts - on the site <a href="http://effman.ru/coworking/">effman.ru/coworking</a> ) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47619/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47619/</a></p>
