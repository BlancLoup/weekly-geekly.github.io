  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to avoid mistakes when ordering a site</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the comments to the topic <a href="http://taisha.habrahabr.ru/blog/38094.html">7 critical errors when ordering the site</a> were wishes to describe not only errors, but also ways to solve them.  Let us leave aside for the time being the brief, project documentation and other important papers and try to create a kind of short checklist that will help to avoid major mistakes when ordering a site.  Every time when you will have doubts that the process is proceeding as it should, once again give yourself the answers to all the following questions. <br><br>  1) <strong>Why do we make a website?</strong>  Prior to the start of work, the most important task that you set for the site should be stated.  This should be one task, it should be specific and measurable.  For example, I plan to increase sales of goods by 25% using the site.  Or, I need a resource that clearly lists our services and provides detailed contact information with a location map.  Or, with the help of the site, I plan to interact with regular customers, carrying out their online support, answering their questions, laying out the necessary documentation and manuals.  All other tasks can also be present, but do not forget the rule ‚ÄúRemember the main thing‚Äù.  In the process of setting the task and creating the site, it is important to periodically check whether this, the most important task is being solved.  This will help constructively discuss problems at all stages, from design to testing of the finished project. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  2) <strong>Do I trust the contractor?</strong>  If you have decided on the choice of web studios, learn to listen to their advice and trust their recommendations.  Most often, the studio is genuinely interested in making a really high-quality project for you, especially if you have clearly set the task.  Finding fault on trifles, imposing your opinion on technical and creative issues is not your task when developing a site. <br><br>  3) <strong>Does the design solve the main task of the site?</strong>  Prior to starting work on the site, its main task should be formulated, examples of sites are given or design wishes are described and the question agreed: is it possible to solve the problem with this design style?  To make it easier for you to decide, try to visit the sites of competitors and check whether it is easy to find the necessary information on them.  If so, how is this solved?  If not, why not?  Ask for advice web studios to learn how to constructively evaluate the design, or trust their recommendations.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      4) <strong>What did I do to ensure that the site visitor found the necessary and interesting information?</strong>  Did I submit it to a web studio or set the task for copywriters?  Remember a simple rule: a website is information designed and structured in a certain way.  I repeat: the site is information.  No information - no site. <br><br>  5) <strong>Whose opinion about the site interests me?</strong>  Do not forget that the site is facing a specific, specific commercial (most often) task.  So try not to pay attention to the opinion of your friend or colleague, especially if they are not supported by specific arguments and you have doubts about their competence in web design.  If you are not sure that the site will be convenient for visitors, order testing in web studios.  It is not so expensive, but it will give you the opportunity to find out how the main task of the site is solved for the representatives of your target audience. <br><br>  6) <strong>Do I understand exactly what a site is?</strong>  The site is a live, changeable and constantly developing tool that you need to solve your problems.  Do not forget about it, so as not to get as a result another ‚Äúmonument to yourself‚Äù on the Internet.  Plan investments in support and development of the site.  If you want to drive a car, it's not enough just to buy it, you will have to pour gasoline, go through maintenance, insure, repair, change tires twice a year, and so on. <br><br>  7) <strong>By what criteria do I rate the work done?</strong>  Forget the word "like"!  In general, the site should not like you, it should solve the problem, as well as be informative and convenient for visitors, no more.  Prepare in advance the evaluation criteria, coordinate them with the web studio, and then the process of monitoring the development of the site and the result will bring you only positive emotions! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/22080/">https://habr.com/ru/post/22080/</a></p>
