  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Hacking Team is back in business: ESET has discovered new spyware samples of the company</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Since it was founded in 2003, the Italian cyber espionage software developer Hacking Team has gained fame by selling its products to governments and intelligence agencies around the world.  The company's flagship capabilities, the Remote Control System (RCS), include extracting files from a target device, intercepting letters and messages, as well as remotely controlling a webcam and microphone. <br><br>  ESET has found previously unknown RCS samples in 14 countries.  The analysis of new samples allows us to conclude that the development of these software tools continues to the Hacking Team itself. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/df/-1/ov/df-1ovwf58iexjtwmqjk0onmmj8.jpeg"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  From Hacking Team to Hacked Team </h3><br>  Hacking Team has repeatedly been criticized for selling spyware to <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2014/02/mapping-hacking-teams-untraceable-spyware/">authoritarian regimes</a> , but it has always denied these allegations.  The situation changed in July 2015, when the company <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/eset/blog/261887/">became a victim of hacking</a> and the facts of using RCS dictatorships were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/06/hacking-team-hacked-firm-sold-spying-tools-to-repressive-regimes-documents-claim">confirmed</a> .  After leaking 400 GB of data, including the customer list, employee correspondence, and spyware source code, the Hacking Team was forced to ask customers to <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/qkv9mp/hacking-team-asks-customers-to-stop-using-its-software-after-hack">stop using RCS</a> and was in a state of uncertainty.

      After hacking, the security community closely followed the company's attempts to get back on its feet.  The first reports of new operations Hacking Team appeared six months later - a <a href="https://reverse.put.as/2016/02/29/the-italian-morons-are-back-what-are-they-up-to-this-time/">new sample of</a> spyware for Mac, apparently used in practice.  A year after the leak, Tablem Limited invested in the Hacking Team, which received 20% of the developer‚Äôs shares.  Tablem Limited is officially registered in Cyprus, but there are indications of its <a href="https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/8xvzyp/hacking-team-investor-saudi-arabia">connection with Saudi Arabia</a> . <br><br>  After completing the study of another spyware, <a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/01/23/guide-makes-possible-peek-finfisher/">FinFisher</a> , we noted two interesting events related to the Hacking Team: a report on the financial recovery of the group and the opening of a new version of RCS with a valid digital certificate. <br><br><h3>  RCS: life goes on </h3><br>  In the early stages of the study, our colleagues from <a href="https://citizenlab.ca/">Citizen Lab</a> , who have been monitoring the activities of the Hacking Team for a long time, provided us with valuable material that enabled us to open a new version of spyware.  Malware is currently used in practice and has a new digital certificate. <br><br>  Further research revealed several more samples of the Hacking Team programs created after the 2015 hack, all of which are slightly modified compared to tools released before the source code was leaked. <br><br>  Samples were compiled from September 2015 to October 2017.  We consider compilation dates to be reliable, as ESET telemetry recorded practical use of samples a few weeks after compilation. <br><br>  Further analysis led to the conclusion that the origin of all samples is reduced to one cyber group;  these are not isolated versions of different developers using the Hacking Team source code merged into the Internet. <br><br>  One of the arguments in favor of this point of view is the sequence of digital certificates that signed the samples.  We found six different certificates issued one after another.  Four of them were issued by Thawte certificate authority to four different companies, two - personal certificates in the name of Valeriano Bedeshi (co-founder of Hacking Team) and a certain Rafael Carnassin, as shown below: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ck/i7/kx/cki7kx5qctms6z3xfq02jjydfsk.png"><br><br>  Samples also contain fake manifest metadata to disguise as legitimate Advanced SystemCare 9 (9.3.0.1121), Toolwiz Care 3.1.0.0 and SlimDrivers (2.3.1.10). <br><br>  Our analysis shows that the author (s) of the samples used VMProtect, apparently trying to make the samples less prone to detection.  The method was used in the Hacking Team programs and before the leak. <br><br>  By itself, the connection between these samples can point to almost any cyber group that modified the Hacking Team fusion source code or the installer, as was the case with <a href="https://www.f-secure.com/documents/996508/1030745/callisto-group">the Callisto group</a> in early 2016.  However, we have collected other evidence that allows us to associate new samples with the developers of the Hacking Team themselves. <br><br>  Versioning in new samples, access to which we received after overcoming VMProtect protection, begins before a leak, continues after it and follows the same patterns.  It is typical for the developers of a company to compile the functional part of Malvari (called Scout and Soldier) consistently and often on the same day - this can be observed in new samples. <br><br>  The table below shows the compilation dates, versions, and certificates of the Hacking Team spyware samples for Windows released from 2014 to 2017.  Reuse of merged source code by the Callisto group is highlighted in red: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hs/c_/jq/hsc_jq600oocntobofxibwsj4_s.png"><br><br>  In addition, our research confirmed that the changes made after the leakage were made in accordance with the Hacking Team's own programming style and are often found in places that indicate a deep understanding of the code.  It is unlikely that a player not from among the developers of the Hacking Team, who creates new versions based on the merged source code, could make changes to these particular fragments. <br><br>  One of the differences between samples before and after a leak is the size of the autorun file.  Before the leak, a copied file of about 4 MB was used.  After the leak, the size was 6 MB - perhaps as a primitive method of protection against detection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gs/lr/-s/gslr-ssuwco27_lpc2nkfiameq4.png"><br><br>  We found some other differences that completely convinced us of the participation of the Hacking Team.  However, disclosing this data may interfere with further monitoring the activity of the group, so we cannot publish it.  Ready to share information with other researchers, the request can be sent to threatintel@eset.com. <br><br>  Spyware functionality largely corresponds to what was in the merged source code.  Our analysis has not yet confirmed the release of any significant update that the Hacking Team <a href="http://www.hackingteam.it/news/2015/07/13/statement-from-CEO.html">promised</a> after hacking. <br><br>  At least two of the studied samples were distributed using phishing mailings.  The malicious executable file was disguised as a PDF document using a double file extension.  Names of bait documents are likely to target potential victims from among diplomatic mission staff. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l7/ej/pn/l7ejpnkog9yiws8scon4pn7797e.png"><br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  Our research suggests that RCS spyware samples, in addition to one exception, are the result of the work of the Hacking Team, and not the reuse of code as in a case with the Callisto group in 2016. <br><br>  At the time of this writing, our telemetry systems are detecting new Hacking Team spyware samples in 14 countries.  We prefer not to name countries in order to prevent incorrect attribution, since the geolocation of detections does not always provide information about the source of the attack. <br><br><h3>  Indicators of compromise </h3><br>  <b>Detection by ESET products</b> <br>  Trojan.Win32 / CrisisHT.F <br>  Trojan.Win32 / CrisisHT.H <br>  Trojan.Win32 / CrisisHT.E <br>  Trojan.Win32 / CrisisHT.L <br>  Trojan.Win32 / CrisisHT.J <br>  Trojan.Win32 / Agent.ZMW <br>  Trojan.Win32 / Agent.ZMX <br>  Trojan.Win32 / Agent.ZMY <br>  Trojan.Win32 / Agent.ZMZ <br><br>  <b>Samples Signed by Ziber Ltd</b> <br>  Thumbprint: 14 56 d8 a0 0d 8b e9 63 e2 22 4d 84 5b 12 e5 08 4e a0 b7 07 <br>  Serial Number: 5e 15 20 5f 18 04 42 cc 6c 3c 0f 03 e1 a3 3d 9f <br><br>  <b>SHA-1</b> <br>  2eebf9d864bef5e08e2e8abd93561322de2ab33b <br>  51506ed3392b9e59243312b0f798c898804913db <br>  61eda4847845f49689ae582391cd1e6a216a8fa3 <br>  68ffd64b7534843ac2c66ed68f8b82a6ec81b3e8 <br>  6fd86649c6ca3d2a0653fd0da724bada9b6a6540 <br>  92439f659f14dac5b353b1684a4a4b848ecc70ef <br>  a10ca5d8832bc2085592782bd140eb03cb31173a <br>  a1c41f3dad59c9a1a126324a4612628fa174c45a <br>  b7229303d71b500157fa668cece7411628d196e2 <br>  eede2e3fa512a0b1ac8230156256fc7d4386eb24 <br><br>  <b>C &amp; Cs</b> <br>  149.154.153.223 <br>  192.243.101.125 <br>  180.235.133.23 <br>  192.243.101.124 <br>  95.110.167.74 <br>  149.154.153.223 <br><br>  <b>Samples signed by ADD Audit</b> <br>  Thumbprint: 3e 19 ad 16 4d c1 03 37 53 26 36 c3 7c a4 c5 97 64 6f bc c8 <br>  Serial Number: 4c 8e 3b 16 13 f7 35 42 f7 10 6f 27 20 94 eb 23 <br><br>  <b>SHA-1</b> <br>  341dbcb6d17a3bc7fa813367414b023309eb69c4 <br>  86fad7c362a45097823220b77dcc30fb5671d6d4 <br>  9dfc7e78892a9f18d2d15adbfa52cda379ddd963 <br>  e8f6b7d10b90ad64f976c3bfb4c822cb1a3c34b2 <br><br>  <b>C &amp; Cs</b> <br>  188.166.244.225 <br>  45.33.108.172 <br>  178.79.186.40 <br>  95.110.167.74 <br>  173.236.149.166 <br><br>  <b>Samples signed by Media Lid</b> <br>  Thumbprint: 17 f3 b5 e1 aa 0b 95 21 a8 94 9b 1c 69 a2 25 32 f2 b2 e1 f5 <br>  Serial Number: 2c e2 bd 0a d3 cf de 9e a7 3e ec 7c a3 04 00 da <br><br>  <b>SHA-1</b> <br>  27f4287e1a5348714a308e9175fb9486d95815a2 <br>  71a68c6140d066ca016efa9087d71f141e9e2806 <br>  dc817f86c1282382a1c21f64700b79fcd064ae5c <br><br>  <b>SHA-1</b> <br>  27f4287e1a5348714a308e9175fb9486d95815a2 <br>  71a68c6140d066ca016efa9087d71f141e9e2806 <br>  dc817f86c1282382a1c21f64700b79fcd064ae5c <br><br>  <b>C &amp; Cs</b> <br>  188.226.170.222 <br>  173.236.149.166 <br><br>  <b>Samples signed by Megabit, OOO</b> <br>  Thumbprint: 6d e3 a1 9d 00 1f 02 24 c1 c3 8b de fa 74 6f f2 3a aa 43 75 <br>  Serial Number: 0f bc 30 db 12 7a 53 6c 34 d7 a0 fa 81 b4 81 93 <br><br>  <b>SHA-1</b> <br>  508f935344d95ffe9e7aedff726264a9b500b854 <br>  7cc213a26f8df47ddd252365fadbb9cca611be20 <br>  98a98bbb488b6a6737b12344b7db1acf0b92932a <br>  cd29b37272f8222e19089205975ac7798aac7487 <br>  d21fe0171f662268ca87d4e142aedfbe6026680b <br>  5BF1742D540F08A187B571C3BF2AEB64F141C4AB <br>  854600B2E42BD45ACEA9A9114747864BE002BF0B <br><br>  <b>C &amp; Cs</b> <br>  95.110.167.74 <br>  188.226.170.222 <br>  173.236.149.166 <br>  46.165.236.62 <br><br>  <b>Samples signed by Rafael Karnasina</b> <br>  Thumbprint: 8a 85 4f 99 2a 5f 20 53 07 f8 2d 45 93 89 af da 86 de 6c 41 <br>  Serial Number: 08 44 8b d6 ee 91 05 ae 31 22 8e a5 fe 49 6f 63 <br><br>  <b>SHA-1</b> <br>  4ac42c9a479b34302e1199762459b5e775eec037 <br>  2059e2a90744611c7764c3b1c7dcf673bb36f7ab <br>  b5fb3147b43b5fe66da4c50463037c638e99fb41 <br>  9cd2ff4157e4028c58cef9372d3bb99b8f2077ec <br>  b23046f40fbc931b364888a7bc426b56b186d60e <br>  cc209f9456f0a2c5a17e2823bdb1654789fcadc8 <br>  99c978219fe49e55441e11db0d1df4bda932e021 <br>  e85c2eab4c9eea8d0c99e58199f313ca4e1d1735 <br>  141d126d41f1a779dca69dd09640aa125afed15a <br><br>  <b>C &amp; Cs</b> <br>  199.175.54.209 <br>  199.175.54.228 <br>  95.110.167.74 <br><br>  <b>Samples Signed by Valeriano Bedeshi</b> <br>  Thumbprint: 44 a0 f7 f5 39 fc 0c 8b f6 7b cd b7 db 44 e4 f1 4c 68 80 d0 <br>  Serial Number: 02 f1 75 66 ef 56 8d c0 6c 9a 37 9e a2 f4 fa ea <br><br>  <b>SHA-1</b> <br>  baa53ddba627f2c38b26298d348ca2e1a31be52e <br>  5690a51384661602cd796e53229872ff87ab8aa4 <br>  aa2a408fcaa5c86d2972150fc8dd3ad3422f807a <br>  83503513a76f82c8718fad763f63fcd349b8b7fc <br><br>  <b>C &amp; Cs</b> <br>  172.16.1.206 is the internal address found in the samples. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352022/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352022/</a></p>
