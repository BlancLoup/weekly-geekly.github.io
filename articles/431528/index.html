The first season of the show, where there were time travels, was shown in a manner different from chronological, and during the subsequent show and release on DVD the order of the episodes was changed again.  On the Internet, fans argued about the order in which it‚Äôs best to watch a show, and the questioner asked if viewers wanted to watch the show in all possible ways, how many episodes would be on their shortest list?  [ <i>referring to a list in which you can find any sequence of episodes / approx.</i>  <i>trans.</i>  ] <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In less than an hour, one anonymous author gave the <a href="http://mathsci.wikia.com/wiki/The_Haruhi_Problem">answer to the question</a> - not a complete solution, but a lower bound for the required number of episodes.  From his reasoning, applicable to any number of episodes, it followed that for Haruhi's first season, which consisted of 14 episodes, viewers would have to watch at least 93,884,313,611 episodes in a row to study all possible permutations.  ‚ÄúExamine the evidence for flaws that I might have missed,‚Äù the author wrote. <br><br>  The proof of seven years remained unnoticed in the mathematical community - it turned out that at that moment only one professional mathematician noticed him, and he did not study it carefully enough.  However, suddenly last month Australian science fiction writer <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/32699.Greg_Egan">Greg Egan</a> proved the existence of a new <a href="http://www.gregegan.net/SCIENCE/Superpermutations/Superpermutations.html">upper limit</a> for the required number of episodes.  Egan's discovery raised an interest in the problem anew and drew attention to the entry concerning the lower bound of 2011.  Both of these proofs are now regarded as significant breakthroughs in the study of the riddle that mathematicians have been researching for at least 25 years.

      Mathematicians quickly checked the upper bound from Eagan, which, like the lower bound, applies to sequences of any length.  Then Robin Houston, a mathematician at Kiln, a data visualization company, and <a href="http://jaypantone.com/">Jay Panton</a> of Marquette University, Milwaukee, independently confirmed the work of an anonymous author with 4chan.  ‚ÄúA lot of effort went into verifying the correctness of this hypothesis,‚Äù said Panton, because the key ideas of the proof were not clearly expressed. <br><br>  And now Houston and Panton, together with <a href="https://people.clas.ufl.edu/vatter/">Vince Vater</a> of the University of Florida, wrote a <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer%3Fa%3Dv%26pid%3Dforums%26srcid%3DMTUwMTUxMjExNDk4NTk5NjY5OTkBMDMxNDgwMTA5ODA5OTYyNzcyNDQBVF9leXJHY19Dd0FKATAuMQEBdjI%26authuser%3D0">formal paper</a> .  In it, they indicated the first author as an ‚Äúanonymous poster 4chan‚Äù. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe strangeness of the situation is that this very elegant proof of a previously unknown fact appeared in such an unlikely place,‚Äù said Houston. <br><br><h2>  Cities permutations </h2><br>  If there are only three episodes in the series, there are six possible ways to watch them: 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, and 321. You can paste them together and make a list of 18 episodes that include each order.  However, there is a more efficient way to glue: 123121321. Such a sequence containing all permutations of a set of n characters is called super-permutation. <br><br>  In 1993, Daniel Ashlock and Janet Tilotson found that when studying the shortest super-permutations for different values ‚Äã‚Äãof n, factorials quickly begin to appear ‚Äî the same values, written as n !, that is, multiplying all numbers from 1 to n (for example, 4 ! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1). <br><br>  If your episode has only 1 episode, then the length of the shortest super-permutation will be equal to 1!  (also known as the good old unit).  For a two-episode series, the shortest super-permutation (121) has a length of 2!  + 1! .. For three episodes (example above) the length is equal to 3!  + 2!  + 1 !, and for four episodes (123412314231243121342132413214321) it will be 4!  + 3!  + 2!  + 1! .. The factorial rule became generally accepted (although no one could prove that it is true for all n), and later mathematicians confirmed it for n = 5. <br><br>  Then in 2014, Houston hit the mathematicians, <a href="">showing</a> that for n = 6 the rule stops working.  The rule predicts that to look at six episodes in all possible ways would require 873 episodes, but Houston found a way to do it in 872. And since there is a simple way to turn a short super-permutation for n characters into a short super-permutation for n + 1 characters, the example of Houston meant that factorials does not work for all n&gt; 6. <br><br>  Building Houston transforms the super-permutation problem into the famous traveling salesman problem, which seeks the shortest path through several cities.  Specifically, super-permutations are associated with the ‚Äúasymmetric‚Äù task of the traveling salesman, in which each path between the two cities has its price (not necessarily the same in both directions), and the goal is to find the cheapest way through all the cities. <br><br>  This transformation is easy to understand: imagine that each permutation is a city, and imagine the path from each permutation to each other permutation.  In the super-permutation problem, we need the shortest sequence of digits in which all permutations are present, so our goal is to go through all permutations so as to add as few numbers as possible to the initial permutation.  We declare that the cost of each path is simply equal to the number of digits we need to append to the end of the first permutation in order to get the second one.  In the example with n = 3, the path from 231 to 312 costs $ 1, since we only need to add 2 to the end of 231 to get 312, and the path from 231 to 132 cost $ 2, because we need to add 32. In such a formulation, the cheapest way is through all cities directly correspond to the shortest super-permutation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c0/835/6d3/0c08356d335194b457b32bcf8eee3c54.jpg"><br><br>  Such a transformation meant that Houston could direct all the possibilities of algorithms for solving the traveling salesman problem to the problem of super-permutation.  This task is known for its belonging to the class NP-complex, which means the absence of the existence of an effective algorithm that can solve it in the general case.  However, there are algorithms that can effectively solve some types of problems, and other algorithms can produce good approximate solutions.  Houston used one of the latter to produce a super-permutation of a length of 872 digits. <br><br>  Since he gave only an approximate solution, it may not even be the most ideal super-permutation.  Mathematicians are now conducting a 3D computational search for the shortest 6-character super-permutation, Panton said.  ‚ÄúWe know that our search will end in a finite time, but we don‚Äôt know if it will take a week or a million years,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúThere is no progress indicator.‚Äù <br><br><h2>  Wrong order </h2><br>  By the time Houston began working, an anonymous post on 4chan had been sitting in his corner of the internet for almost three years.  One mathematician, <a href="http://www.njohnston.ca/">Nathaniel Johnston</a> of Mount Ellison University, noticed a copy of this post on another site a few days after this entry appeared - not because he was an anime lover, but because he entered different queries into Google, associated with super-permutations. <br><br>  Johnston read the evidence and it seemed reliable to him, but he did not waste his energy on thorough verification.  At that time, mathematicians believed that the factorial formula for super-permutations was most likely correct, and when you think you know the exact answer to the question, the lower bound for the estimate is of little interest to you.  In other words, the episodes of the series about super-permutations went in the wrong order. <br><br>  After that, Johnston mentioned a lower bound on a <a href="http://www.njohnston.ca/2013/04/the-minimal-superpermutation-problem/">couple</a> <a href="https://oeis.org/A180632">of websites</a> , but ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think someone paid special attention to this,‚Äù he said. <br><br>  Then, on September 26, 2018, mathematician <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/">John Baez</a> of the University of California at Riverside tweeted a <a href="https://twitter.com/johncarlosbaez/status/1045084142151450624">post</a> about the opening of Houston from 2014, as part of a series of tweets about obvious mathematical patterns that stop working. <br><br>  <i>Note</i>  <i>Trans.: there was not such a big series of tweets, just three.</i>  <i>The other two are also interesting in their own right, although they are not related to this article.</i>  <i>One says that 6 is the most popular distance between two neighboring primes for all primes less than 17,427,000,000,000,000,000,000,000. And then this pattern suddenly stops working!</i>  <i>The second demonstrates the following connection of integrals, trigonometric functions and the number œÄ</i> <i><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/385/43f/bcf/38543fbcff820c1c896d2f424a3ec2ff.jpg"><br><br></i>  <i>But only for n &lt;9.8 √ó 10 <sup>42</sup> !</i> <br><br>  His tweet attracted the attention of Egan, who studied mathematics several decades ago, before his career as a recognized science fiction writer began (his first successful story, by happy coincidence, was called "City of Permutations").  ‚ÄúI have never ceased to be interested in mathematics,‚Äù wrote Egan by mail. <br><br>  Egan wondered if it was possible to create a super-permutation even shorter than that of Houston.  He plunged into the study of literature on how to create shortcuts in the networks of permutations, and after a few weeks he found what he needed.  For a couple of days, he derived a new upper bound for the length of the shortest super-permutation of n characters: n!  + (n - 1)!  + (n - 2)!  + (n - 3)!  + n - 3. It is similar to the factorial formula, from which many members are excluded. <br><br>  "It completely broke the previous upper limit," said Houston. <br><br>  The lower bound of the author of the post on 4chan was seductively close to the new upper boundary: n!  + (n - 1)!  + (n - 2)!  + n - 3. After publishing the result, Egan Johnston reminded mathematicians of the proof of an anonymous author, and Houston with Panton soon proved its correctness.  As in the work of Houston, the new lower and upper bounds approach super-permutations from the point of view of the traveling salesman problem: the lower boundary shows that the path through all cities must pass through some minimum number of paths worth more than $ 1, and the upper boundary creates a special path for each n, using only connections worth $ 1 and $ 2. <br><br>  Now researchers are trying to bring the upper and lower bounds together, and to find a single formula that solves the problem of super-permutation.  ‚ÄúProbably, in the end, people will still solve this riddle,‚Äù predicted Baez.  ‚ÄúNow everything looks good.‚Äù <br><br>  For Haruhi fans, Egan‚Äôs solution gives precise instructions on how to view all the possible options for the order of the first season, using a total of 93,924,230,411. You can start browsing today, or you can wait until the mathematicians can still cut that number.  The lower bound from an anonymous author proves that this cuts will not save them more than 40 million episodes - however, this is enough to start preparing for the second season. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/431528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/431528/</a></p>
