  <section class="page js-page"><h1>B2BX: the economy of ICO and the main areas of expenditure of investors' money B2BX</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  B2BX today is a one-of-a-kind cryptocurrency liquidity aggregator for margin and stock trading.  The aggregator works, among other things, in the direction of the distribution of liquidity by brokerage companies.  It should be noted that B2BX will cooperate with institutional clients.  First of all, these are stock and cryptocurrency exchanges, Forex, stock and cryptocurrency brokers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/oh/rk/ut/ohrkutz-emfzi7mwdzy4sglzlau.jpeg"><br><br>  The platform is currently conducting an initial token allocation (ICO) to receive investments for the implementation of its project.  The company's plans are quite ambitious, and funds are needed to implement all of the plans.  This article describes the main points of the ICO, including how many tokens will be released, how many funds and what needs to be raised. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Why raise funds at all, why not do it yourself?  The fact is that to be able to provide exchange and marginal liquidity, a company must have a whole set of licenses.  B2BX is no exception.  To work in the field of stock trading, B2BX plans to work with a Japanese company that already has the necessary documents.  To carry out transactions with marginal liquidity type, licenses are needed based on CySec, ASIC, FCA.  The total number of company licenses will directly depend on the success of the crowdfunding campaign.

      Obtaining the aforementioned licenses is a very laborious and costly process from a financial point of view, including the payment of mandatory state fees and guarantee deposits, as well as a set of measures to create, prepare and support a corporate structure.  The most financially costly are the following activities: <br><br><ul><li>  obtaining the services of specialized specialists in the field of finance and law in each jurisdiction where it is planned to start the work of the exchange.  Working with specialists is needed for the qualitative preparation of a package of documents for applying for a license and creating an effective business model; </li><li>  company registration in each of the jurisdictions where it is planned to start work; </li><li>  opening of physical offices in these jurisdictions and hiring staff; </li><li>  opening bank accounts in the jurisdictions where you plan to work; </li><li>  company support, including financial services and AML support; </li><li>  license renewal (annual) and the companies themselves. </li></ul><br>  The operation of the platform in several jurisdictions at once is necessary for entering large local markets.  This will allow the company to operate in accordance with the requirements of local law. <br><br>  New employees are needed both to manage the project team and to create and maintain a technical base, including the aggregator itself, a trading platform, and other elements of the technical infrastructure. <br><br><h3>  How many tokens are planned to be released? </h3><br>  The target sales of B2BX tokens is ‚Ç¨ 25 million (about ‚Ç¨ 6 million has already been raised).  For this purpose, 50 million tokens will be issued, of which 40 million are planned to be sold, and 10 million to be left for the company's internal needs (more on this below).  Thus, the value of the token in the sale will be ‚Ç¨ 0.63.  You can buy them for Bitcoins (including fork), esters, lightcoins, DASH, XMR. <br><br><h3>  How is ICO going? </h3><br>  The ICO is a legal entity registered in Hong Kong. <br><br>  After the completion of ICO, the further release of tokens will be prohibited.  All unsold tokens are scheduled to be destroyed within 48 hours after the completion of the ICO.  If the amount collected by the organizers of the ICO is below ‚Ç¨ 5 million, then all funds raised will be returned to the participants within 48 days after the completion of the ICO. <br><br><h3>  Safety of participants </h3><br>  The organizers of the ICO pay special attention to the safety of participants in the primary token allocation.  To do this, in particular, uses a distributed architecture of network services, including a personal account, API, database. <br><br>  For the distribution of tokens will be used the so-called "cold wallets" with the confirmation of the transaction from several participants.  The funds collected during the ICO will be protected by a multi-signature.  Withdrawal from these wallets will be possible only if the transaction is signed by two or more participants.  At the same time, viewing the balance of these wallets will be available to everyone. <br><br><h3>  What about the B2BX token? </h3><br>  After the completion of ICO, it will be free to bargain on all cryptocurrency exchanges that are created as part of the turnkey crypto-exchange service, as well as on several major platforms that are in the top 15 according to CoinMarketCap. <br><br>  Part of the B2BX tokens that are distributed between team members will not be available for trading.  Thus, the organizers plan to reduce the risk of falling the value of the token. <br><br>  In general, upon completion of the ICO, the project team hopes to receive funds that it will use to fulfill its goals, including the active development of the B2BX platform.  The B2BX aggregator itself is already working, in 2017 over 30 new customers are connected to it.  But ICO will allow the project to operate on a much larger scale than it does now, making it available to clients from more jurisdictions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/341410/">https://habr.com/ru/post/341410/</a></p>
