  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to write official documents</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f6/98/f6982db952d99877447fe34f6b43116f.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  Any young developer starting a career in a more or less large firm will sooner or later be confronted with the need to write official documents.  The story usually begins with similar phrases: <br><ul><li>  Already done the job?  Write a report on the work done. </li><li>  Your computer needs to be picked up from the service.  Go, write a receipt and take it. </li><li>  You do not need to upgrade the computer?  Write a memo. </li><li>  When are you planning a vacation?  Write a statement to the personnel department. </li></ul><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  And how to write this?  This is not code in any programming language - this is the text that people will read.  This text even sometimes (oh horror!) Must be written on paper by hand.  Often the writing of such documents is not taught in technical colleges and an understanding of what to do, a person does not have at all. <br><br>  So, the first thing to do is to ask the person who gave you the task if there is a standard template for this document.  Do not hesitate to ask!  First of all, you studied in a university for 5 years in a technical specialty, and not in some kind of documentary or archivist.  This is not your main specialty - to write documents, there is nothing terrible in your ignorance or lack of experience.  Secondly, each firm has its own standards for issuing such papers, which can also change depending on changes in legislation or changes in key figures in the company (chief accountant, director, head of personnel department).  By the way, for the same reason you should not start rummaging around looking for a similar document on the Internet.  Of course, you will find something, but not the fact that it will give a ride to your particular company.  There is nothing wrong with clarifying the current standard if you don‚Äôt know it.  When asked about the standard, you may be given 2 answer choices (we are both satisfied). 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <h5>  1. Here is the standard, hold </h5><br>  Everything is simple.  We take a sample, we write in the same way.  The main thing here is to remember to write the names and dates not as in the sample, but yours.  :) <br><br><h5>  2. And as if there is no standard </h5><br>  At first, the answer is scary.  There is a thought - what to do?  Do not panic.  In fact, it is still easier.  If there is no standard, then no one will say that what is written is not done according to the standard (logical, right?).  So you can actually write in the free form.  Moreover, what is written is likely to become the standard in this company from now and forever.  Therefore, we write something like this: in the upper right, to whom and from whom the document (with full names and positions).  In the center below - the name of the document ("report", "statement", "memo").  Further, the text is absolutely free presentation (well, except that without mats, lies or familiarity).  Below is the date and signature.  Fields - 2 cm on the left and 1 cm from the other sides.  Everything. <br><br>  Tsimes here is that an intelligent person, reading this paper, will read the central part - that is,  the very essence of the document, and he will understand it.  On the design and ryushechki he does not care, and his document will suit.  But a fool or a clerical rat will not be able to blunt a document with the correct hider and footer in any way - for them such a piece of paper is sacred regardless of the internal filling of the text and such a document also suits them. <br><br>  PS Maybe I wrote a trivial, however, the panic of young employees from the inability to do the assigned task - a thing very frequent (and often very destructive).  It would be desirable, that at least from such simple and household trifles as similar papers, it did not arise. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/98073/">https://habr.com/ru/post/98073/</a></p>
