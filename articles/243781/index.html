  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Interview marketer. Typical HR errors</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this publication I will try to reflect on the typical mistakes that employers make during interviews and try to reflect on the nuances that you need to know when offering a job. <br><br>  At the time of this writing, I leisurely was looking for a job as a marketer, an advertising department manager, while at the same time doing my own project.  Honestly, there was no special need for work, because  there was additional income and a lot of time was spent on working with the site, but since the monetization according to preliminary calculations should take at least six months, and I still love the money, it was necessary to have a spare trump card up your sleeve. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I had the experience of hiring people and, accordingly, working with the people I hired.  With job search and communication with employers experience was much less.  Having gone to several interviews, I, frankly, was shocked.  How can you be so careless about recruiting?  So the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwriting this article was born. <br><br>  Hiring an employee who will promote your company - you need to understand that this is a long time.  Also, you should understand that you subsequently work with him.  Remember - you are looking for a person who should cover your rears and bring money, not a person who wants to have an interview and subsequently be a burden.  A job interview is not a matter of self-love.  An interview is an opportunity to evaluate a future candidate.  Your main tasks at the interview are to identify the strengths and weaknesses, assess the level of skills that the candidate owns and how he can be useful to you.

    <h4>  Notify the candidate about the interview at least 2 days in advance </h4><br>  A good specialist always needs time to prepare.  Analyze your company, product or service that you provide.  Identify strengths and weaknesses.  View online activity.  This will give you the opportunity to communicate more specifically on the interview, without chasing the water.  It also allows you to understand how competent the person you are hiring.  If the applicant does not know anything about you, then it is worth thinking. <br><br><h4>  Do not assign several people at one time. </h4><br>  At a minimum, it is ugly and unprofessional.  You will not reveal a person in 5 minutes of conversation. <br><br><h4>  Read and analyze resume </h4><br>  It would not be funny, but in most cases HR simply does not read the summary.  Try to navigate the situation.  Resume should always be analyzed.  See which companies the future candidate worked for.  Do not be lazy to look at these companies, as it is presented on the market.  Often, behind a beautiful name lies a mounting company, whose promotion is at no level.  This will allow you to weed out unnecessary and incompetent candidates, save strength and energy. <br><br><h4>  Attend the interview </h4><br>  Very often trust the choice of candidate HR.  This is fundamentally wrong!  I repeat, you work with this person, set tasks, discuss projects.  If you have a person in direct submission, then you must understand that this is your if not the right, then at least your left hand. <br><br><h4>  Determine who you need </h4><br>  Remember, no matter how cool the specialist is, he will not cover all segments of advertising and marketing.  The field of advertising and marketing is now so vast and multifaceted that it is simply impossible to know and be able to do everything.  It is good if you stumble upon a universal soldier tank, which will compose a sales funnel, write the semantic core, draw a design, and provide advertising companies with an advertising budget, and after work hit the flyer and assemble the banner.  But there are still quite a few such specialists on the market, they are expensive, and they themselves choose an employer.  In the average case, the most correct thing is to assess your weaknesses of the advertising company and look for the person who will strengthen them.  The main criterion - the candidate must be competent, sane and trained. <br><br><h4>  Do not ask idiotic general questions </h4><br>  Like ‚ÄúWhat is marketing for you‚Äù, ‚Äúwhat types of advertising do you know,‚Äú how to promote our company or how to sell our goods ‚Äù,‚Äú how can you be useful to us ‚Äù,‚Äú What is the name of the market where there are only two manufacturers (or sellers ) this product and many buyers. " <br><br>  It is all morally obsolete.  Online a lot of answers to these questions.  If you are looking for a theorist - humanist - balabola - weasel, then yes.  You will meet the blanks that do not give anything.  A specialist such questions simply put in a stupor.  This is a philosophy and such topics are discussed for hours in the kitchen or in a cafe over a glass of whiskey.  I also consider stumbling with terminology a silly idea.  There are a lot of terms now and it is simply impossible to remember everything.  It will not come out of the wonders of a good marketer.  It is much more important that a person understands these processes and can apply them. <br><br><h4>  Do not put idiotic tasks or tests </h4><br>  Very often HR likes to set a task like ‚ÄúSell me a pen!‚Äù, Or ‚ÄúThere are 8 balls, 1 of them is harder, how to figure out which one in 2 weighings?‚Äù. <br><br>  It will not give you anything.  In the 1992 textbooks (!) They write that such questions will help to reveal resourcefulness, ingenuity and analytical thinking.  This is partly true if you are looking for a sales assistant or analyst.  It is also widely believed that a good marketer should be a good sales person.  In my opinion, this is fundamentally not true.  Remember, the seller sells the pen himself, the marketer does so that the pen sells itself and they want to buy it.  In more detail about the reflections on the sale of pens, I will write in another article. <br><br><h4>  Ask THE RIGHT QUESTIONS </h4><br>  At the interview you need to identify the competence of the applicant.  His strengths and weaknesses.  In my opinion, the only way to do this is to ask specific questions related to specialization and future tasks. <br><br>  Examples: <br><br><ul><li>  Car Dealer: Engaged in the sale of cars.  Summer.  There are a lot of winter tires in stock.  How to implement them in the summer? </li><li>  Restaurant or cafe: Opened a new point, attendance is small.  What steps will you take to increase attendance? </li><li>  Network of carwash: Customers began to go to competitors.  How to try to identify the cause?  And what will be the next steps? </li><li>  Online store: What can you say about our website?  Advantages and disadvantages.  What can be improved?  What would you add or remove? </li><li>  Hotel: We plan to introduce additional services.  What would you implement? </li><li>  Construction company: It is planned to share 10% discount for the quarter.  meter.  What advertising tools will you use? </li><li>  With such questions, you must understand how competent a person is in the area in which he plans to work. </li></ul><br>  The second thing you need to identify what skills the candidate possesses.  It all depends on who you need. <br><br>  Examples: <br><br><ul><li>  Sales funnel, describe in your own words what it is; </li><li>  Have experience in conducting promotions?  Tell; </li><li>  What advertising contractors did you work with?  Name a few.  What do they do? </li><li>  Do you know what contextual advertising is?  Are there examples of successful companies? </li><li>  SMM.  What soc.  networks worked?  What functions performed? </li><li>  Are there any skills in working with graphic programs?  What exactly.  Is there any portfolio? </li></ul><br>  Etc. <br><br>  In general, candidates describe their skills in the resume, but from experience I can say that most of them are the same.  Do not be lazy, and go over all the skills to understand how a person is competent in a particular area. <br><br><h4>  Probation </h4><br>  My opinion.  The trial period should be 1 month.  If the employee does not join during this time, then you do not need him. <br><br><h4>  Recommendations </h4><br>  Be sure to call the companies in which the applicant worked.  Moreover, try to call not by the phone numbers that are indicated in the resume, but try to reach the director, department head, and colleagues.  Pay special attention to those companies where there are no recommendations.  Do not be shy.  This will give you a more accurate picture of the person you hire. <br><br>  In fact, the nuances are much more.  Most importantly, during the interview you yourself need a little bit of ‚Äúbe in the subject.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/243781/">https://habr.com/ru/post/243781/</a></p>
