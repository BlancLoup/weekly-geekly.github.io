Now only the lazy never went to Coursera or the Khan Academy in search of something new and exciting.  And after 6 weeks you are already an expert on Peking Opera or Big Data and are eager to share this amazing news with the world.  But when it comes to making a resume, you think: is it worth it to brag? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/632/bb8/b34/632bb8b34b5945c580db52bde2b3cd94.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Worth it!  This is what HR specialists say about online education, its place in the resume and the importance of employee self-development for the company:

    <h4>  <b>Ekaterina Tarasova, HR-generalist PepsiCo</b> </h4><h6>  It all depends on the specifics of the vacancy.  If a candidate applying for a production, engineering position, indicates online courses in a resume - I will treat this with caution, but if the area is humanitarian, for example, marketing, it is positive.  Itself periodically I study remotely, good now there are webinars, where people communicate the same way as in a real seminar. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>Anton Klygin, Accenture Recruitment Specialist</b> </h4><h6>  For me as a recruiter, the online courses passed by the candidate first of all speak about purposefulness, aspiration to self-study, give an additional idea about the directions interesting to the candidate.  In the summary should indicate only those online courses that are relevant to the post. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>Irina Smolyakova, Vice President, Asteros Group</b> </h4><h6>  I still respond with enthusiastic surprise to the resume in which the candidate indicated an online course.  From practice I will say that today this, unfortunately, is still a rarity.  Obviously, among graduates and young specialists, the section ‚Äútraining‚Äù in resumes is reduced to the name of the educational institution, and from established specialists to the list of trainings and internships held in employing companies. The fact is that having a list of trainings in resumes is an indicator of good level, rather, previous employers, than the human desire for development.  Corporations purposefully organize the training of their employees; this is not a person‚Äôs wish, but rather a realized requirement of the company.  With online courses everything is different.  After all, in order to choose a course, pass, pass a test, a person must have a conscious need. </h6><br><h6>  I believe that it is absolutely necessary to indicate the courses taken online in the resume, but you should understand that this does not provide guaranteed benefits for hiring.  Everything depends on the company: someone needs a mature and experienced person who will start doing their job today.  And there are those who value not only qualifications, but also potential;  and here the presence of a person's intention to develop is an indisputable and guaranteed advantage. </h6><br><h6>  People who are able to learn independently are a minority.  And they will be a priori successful.  If you do not think your life without learning and development, then choose the companies for which it is important. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>Svetlana Naydina, Head of the Department of Personnel Management "He Clinic"</b> </h4><h6>  I have a positive attitude to any type of training, especially additional, no matter whether it is connected with a profession or not.  The presence in the resume of completed online courses characterizes the candidate as a person capable of self-organization and striving for development.  The field of activity of our company is medical services, and additional training gives our employees an advantage as additional income. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>Oleg Lisin, business coach at the recruitment agency Staff-Up, owner of the consulting group JUST4BUSY</b> </h4><h6>  Like any education, online courses are always a big plus for a candidate.  But only if the person really learned something, and not just received a diploma for a tick.  I myself enjoyed several courses at coursera.org.  Normal employers evaluate the candidate precisely because he knows how, and not according to where he studied. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>Svetlana Kazarinova, HR Director, Atriniti</b> </h4><h6>  In general, I react well when I see online courses in resumes, for me this is an indication that a person is looking for opportunities to learn and develop.  If his education is limited only to online courses, then I have a lot of additional questions, and I will most likely choose a candidate with a good basic education, supplemented by courses, including online. </h6><br><br><h4>  <b>Lydia Krasikova, training manager, private consultant</b> </h4><h6>  It seems to me that a serious education should be contact.  But this approach is already outdated, everything must be considered individually.  It should be borne in mind that there are very busy people and those who want to study abroad, but they do not have such an opportunity.  I think that it‚Äôs necessary to display the completed online courses in the resume.  At the very recruiter you need to understand, the person really learned something or put it in ‚Äúfor wit‚Äù.  Will he understand this or not, depends already on personal installations. </h6><br>  <b>Conclusion.</b> <br>  Feel free to specify online courses in your resume, this will indicate your desire to learn and develop - this will be especially true for companies for which not only qualifications, but also potential are important.  If possible, indicate those courses that are related to your field of activity, especially if you have a technical specialty.  Online courses should harmoniously complement your basic education, and not replace it.  And finally: those who do not need a kick in the ass, to learn something, in this life will not be lost. <br><br>  Matured for an online course?
