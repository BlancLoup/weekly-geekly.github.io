  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Headphones Arctic Sound P311 - ears on top</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Wires, wires - flowing like water.  At the same time, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi filled all kinds of mobile devices with their antennas.  Wireless mice, keyboards, game controllers, but first of all, headphones.  It was with them that the manufacturers decided to start universal ‚Äúbluetooth addiction‚Äù.  The manufacturer of headphones Arctic Sound, little-known in the Russian market, also did not disregard this niche in the market and introduced mobile headphones with the serial number ‚ÄúP311‚Äù. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/e9/fb/e9fbf1262bc2dff59781fbbfedb28ccb.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For those who do not know, Bluetooth is a wireless standard that provides communication between devices at a distance of up to 100 m. In fact, the range of Bluetooth antennas in most used gadgets is 3-5 meters, maximum 10 meters.  Yes, and this distance varies depending on the obstacles in the path of the signal.

Yes, yes, these guys are able to do the best cooling in the world for top-end video cards and the coolest thermal paste - MX2 ‚Äã‚Äãor MX3.  But you won't be satisfied with some coolers, and therefore, under a subsidiary brand, you saw the headset and speakers. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/61/42/61424ac25b872d38cd344f043dc116f5.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Let's start with the technical characteristics of P311: <br><br>  Bluetooth version: V.2.1 + EDR Class 2; <br>  Profile support: A2DP, AVRCP, HSP, HFP 1.5; <br>  Range: up to 20 m; <br>  In the mode of use: up to 20 hours; <br>  Standby time: up to 400 hours; <br>  Weight: 71.2 g. <br><br>  As can be seen from the design, the P311 differs from the usual headphone wearing style.  "Neckband" (I did not find the best way to call it) interconnects two headphones.  Holding, clinging to the ears, in my opinion, is not the best idea.  But, on the other hand, the manufacturer indicates the main qualities of the product - mobility, lightness and sportiness.  Well, this style of wearing is not new at all and it has a place to be with other manufacturers.  But to get used to the headphones you just have to.  First, the first two days my ears were clearly not comfortable with the fact that they are holding headphones.  Secondly, the plastic spike on the rim is far from ideal and rubs the ears during a sharp movement.  But the benefits seem to me anyway more.  The manufacturer obviously guessed with the weight, the headphones are almost not felt.  If the music in the ears did not play, then from time to time you would check whether they were lost. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/58/94/58944c5dcdd803f6726e042495ff72c8.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Undoubtedly, an important point is ease of use.  Most Russian people, thanks to their mentality, do not read instructions for new devices, preferring to figure it out on their own.  Referring to this type of people, I was not immediately able to connect the P311 with the HTC Legend.  It turns out to connect the headphones with another Bluetooth-device button with the handset you need to hold for 5-7 seconds.  I immediately released it, but the headphones, of course, were not identified. <br>  On the contour of the button with the handset, four more were placed: increase-decrease the volume and the next-previous track.  Simple and convenient, but you cannot grope while listening to the desired button.  At first, I even shot them to turn up the volume, and I switched the tracks on the phone.  But over time, I learned to touch the volume up button. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/ba/66/ba669f867e09536e63c9109b585836a0.jpg"></a> <br><br>  Compactness is another undoubted advantage of this model.  It even has a special case that can be used to store or carry headphones.  But because of its size, I prefer to carry the ‚Äúears‚Äù around my neck.  Yes, and thanks to bending souls a lot of space in the bag, they also do not occupy. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/2e/c5/2ec58e7358f0e66e24e797ffc50f2751.jpg"></a> <br><br>  I have no complaints about the sound quality.  The sound is clean enough, and deep and crisp bass sounds even strange for such headphones.  Honestly expect good quality for $ 40 for Bluetooth headphones I could not.  But now I can say that I know at least one Bluetooth headphone with such a cost that can provide high quality sound.  Also, headphones can still be used to communicate by phone.  But here, for me, one thing remained incomprehensible.  When an outgoing call is communicating, the sound goes through the headphones, but when they call me, in the headphones I get silence, and I have to communicate through the phone.  Why?  It turned out that to transfer the conversation to the headphones, you must press the button with the handset on them.  And if you take the call in the usual way, then the sound will go through a mobile phone. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/f4/7c/f47c78bc6fd2ae3f67c2709841b4dac0.jpg"></a> <br><br>  And in conclusion, I note that for a month of use, I only once charged the headphones.  I do not use them all the time, but they work out exactly the time stated by the manufacturer.  In my opinion, these headphones will be a great gift for the New Year. <br><br> <a title="Habraffe.ru" href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/fe/d3/fed32071dc4352edce2a5f2ddcf6b6f5.jpg"></a> <br><br><img align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/habraeffect/04/46/04469863f3e95126ee5f346f81720d0d.png">  Detailed test headphones and their amplitude-frequency characteristics look in the next issue of the <a href="http://i-zine.ru/">journal "i"</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110418/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110418/</a></p>
