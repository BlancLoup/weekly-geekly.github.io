  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Venue</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Remember the recent series of articles ( <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/108615/">1</a> | <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/109339/">2</a> | <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/110234/">3</a> ) about the production of processors?  Honestly, I was pleasantly surprised by the reaction to these articles - at least every time you write this!  But this is just some material from the lectures of Intel, which I mentioned a couple of times in this blog.  But historically, the audience of Habr is rather biased about the announcements of even interesting events - as a result, those who might be interested in events often don‚Äôt know. <br><br> <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/intel/blog/114638/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d0c/1ed/ceb/d0c1edceb40b585a65ef5f2a410d1fe5.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  By the way, if suddenly uncontrollably wants to visit some IT or near-event event, where will you look for its announcement?  I can give a minute to think about it, but I‚Äôm almost sure that besides ‚ÄúMm ... well, I‚Äôll catch on Habr√©, for example ... or in Yandex ...‚Äù there will be no clearer answer.  Especially if you are not looking purposefully, but according to the principle of "where to go."  At the beginning of the year, blogs were restructured at Habr√© ‚Äî a blog appeared for all, all, and all events.  But ... as practice has shown, they continue to write about meetings and conferences wherever possible.

      But, you see, it would be great to have some kind of secluded place on the network, where there would be actual information about all the industry events - meetings of startups, meetings of amateur MIDs, exhibitions of digital art, lectures on search algorithms and master classes on photography. .  And all this is broken down into categories, with the possibility of choosing your city, with the opportunity to discuss past and upcoming events, with blackjack ... <br><br>  Okay, I will not beat around the bush - I know the address of one such town.  It is called <b><a href="http://theoryandpractice.ru/">T &amp; P</a></b> (Theory &amp; Practice, Theory &amp; Practice) - a project that brings together people who are looking for new knowledge and are willing to share it.  Lectures, seminars, workshops, exhibitions and conferences ... the creators themselves call it all in one word, Edutainment, since any space can be a platform for such an event: a bar or club, gallery or studio, office or cafe, lecture hall or park as a visitor can be anyone. <br><br>  Why did we suddenly decide to talk about this project, and even in the corporate blog?  It's simple - Intel understands all the imperfections of the blog " <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/conference/">Events</a> " on Habr√© and tries to fix it in every way) But seriously, the corporation is not the first day involved in the development of this socially useful resource, and wanted to tell even not so much about exhibitions and lectures how much about the other two sections, representing no less value. <br><br>  <b>Just about the complicated</b> .  Only relatively recently there were only a few articles, but today there is already something to read - <a href="http://theoryandpractice.ru/posts/howitworks">come in</a> and see everything yourself.  In short - T &amp; P lucidly explains the principles of operation of various mechanisms and phenomena that we don‚Äôt even think about in everyday life.  It may be ‚Äúabout the complex‚Äù that is not described in as much detail as in many hours of television programs, but, on the other hand, these notes are read as quickly as tweets or short jokes in newspapers.  What is integral, entropy and Doppler effect ... principles of operation of the printer, microwave, gyroscope, torrents and Wi-Fi - only a small part of what they say "on the fingers." <br><br> <a href="http://theoryandpractice.ru/posts/howitworks"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ea/56c/99b/5ea56c99b4e7c37ab1674baaec1b953f.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  <i>Higher mathematics in my life came in handy only once - when the keys fell into the toilet, I had to twist the integral from the wire.</i> <br><br>  In addition to educational articles about various technologies and phenomena, the site also has a <a href="http://theoryandpractice.ru/posts/visibly-smart">section</a> , named after the new Intel Core processors.  In ‚Äú <b>Smart, and it shows</b> ‚Äù are short interviews with activists of RuNet, the creators of large projects.  I was pleased to read that different smart people think about the same things.  It is logical to assume that over time, stocks of materials are replenished. <br><br> <a href="http://theoryandpractice.ru/posts/visibly-smart"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a11/73a/213/a1173a21320d1aa553e37f0cc0e2b31a.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Enjoy reading! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/114638/">https://habr.com/ru/post/114638/</a></p>
