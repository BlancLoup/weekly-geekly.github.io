  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How clouds change data centers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today, almost every third adult is somehow connected to the clouds.  Our Gmail is synchronized with the smartphone, well, or the photos are uploaded to Dropbox, available 24 hours a day.  It‚Äôs not for me to tell that in modern society, both large and small companies are not far behind users and actively ‚Äúgo to the clouds‚Äù.  In the meantime, cloud technologies are being rebuilt and becoming more and more perfect and widespread, and these are not just words, but there are a lot of facts that have been repeatedly discussed by the habra-community.  At the moment, as the development trend shows, the emphasis on data delivery, work stability and traffic distribution has begun to increase.  Data centers, like other technologies, had to adapt to growing demands and trends through the introduction of new technologies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c29/76c/7e4/c2976c7e4df848dcb0ef0457c75779be.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Cloud computing.</b>  As you know, there are four cloud computing deployment models ‚Äî private, public, public, and hybrid clouds.  Open source projects such as the Open Stack and Cloud Stack create powerful cloud-based APIs for the implementation of various services and platforms.  Most of these technologies continue to evolve and improve.  Cloud computing and related technologies unify cloud architecture.  Today, software-defined technology is more than just a loud term.  This is a way to organize the management of heterogeneous storage equipment at the same logical level.  When there is a rapprochement between the network, storage and computing on the one hand, and software-defined technologies on the other, valuable ‚Äúbuilding blocks‚Äù for cloud data centers appear.

Controls can "bypass" geographic policies, query rules.  SDN (Software-defined Networking) allows you to create a global smart environment.  It is planned that in the future SDN will create more flexible automation of traffic flows.  IT administrators can use the management console without manual hardware configuration.  SDN can also resist DDoS attacks.  You can also create a tunnel with data encryption, even if the attacker steals the data, he will not be able to read them.  Now, SDN helps manage global traffic by logically directing it to the required data center.  These achievements will help to cope with downtime, planning for coping with the consequences of accidents, to increase resiliency. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f0e/bbf/ced/f0ebbfced08f48e094785c413550e8e3.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Overcoming the consequences of accidents / Continuity of production.</b>  Emergency situations can occur at any time, and for any reason.  Clouds will help in this case.  Whether it is an active site or a ‚Äúpay-as-you-go‚Äù service, disaster recovery strategy becomes more accessible.  The GSLB (global server load balancing) and GTM (global traffic management) technologies, like administrators, help users stay closer to their data centers.  They distribute requests and loads on applications based on the user's location, the location of servers, certain rules.  As a result, the user connects to the nearest possible resource.  Even if the connection fails, GSLB and GTM will immediately redirect the user to the next available resource. <br><br>  According to the latest Cisco Global Cloud Index: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f7/14c/5d4/7f714c5d4f43460ead2126524475b813.jpg"><br><br><ul><li>  The annual global cloud IP traffic will reach 5.3 Zettabytes before the end of 2017. By 2017, global cloud IP traffic will reach 443 exabytes per month (compared to 98 exabytes per month in 2012). </li><li>  Global cloud-based IP traffic will increase almost 4.5 times over the next 5 years.  Overall, cloud-based IP traffic will grow by an average of 35 percent from 2012 to 2017. </li><li>  Until 2017, cloud traffic will account for more than two thirds of the total data center traffic. </li></ul><br>  <a href="http://youtu.be/7hcT8T-FmsA">http://youtu.be/7hcT8T-FmsA</a> <br><br>  More data is stored in the clouds and devices are connecting to the Internet.  Projects can provide the user with their services and applications, without having their own hardware.  The reliability of computer computing is growing, which will help in the future to create new platforms and products. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244805/</a></p>
