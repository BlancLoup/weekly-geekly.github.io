It is difficult to say what causes such activity of manufacturers, because in real life, even among people involved in sports, they are rare, and ordinary colleagues in the biological species, and even less.  Perhaps one of the reasons for the regular release of new models is the novelty of the idea itself - the gadget market is oversaturated and in dire need of innovation, and manufacturers have grasped a fresh idea.  However, they cannot be blamed for thoughtlessness, and since new models are constantly being released, it means that this is a demanded product. <br><br>  Today we want to offer you a comparative review of three fitness trackers from different manufacturers.  This is not a choice of the best device, but a review in which we will try to tell about the features and advantages of each model.  And so you have to choose to like. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Functions of fitness trackers </h1><table width="700"><tbody><tr><th>  Model </th><th>  Garmin Vivofit </th><th>  Huawei Talkband B1 </th><th>  Sony smartband </th></tr><tr><td>  IOS support </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  Android support </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Windows Phone Support </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  Activity Data </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Food data </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  Data on sleep </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Stair data </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  Time indication </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  Vibration </td><td>  not </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Alarm clock </td><td>  not </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Water protection </td><td>  up to 50 meters </td><td>  IP57 </td><td>  IP58 </td></tr><tr><td>  Work with heart rate sensor </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  Computer synchronization </td><td>  Bluetooth </td><td>  not </td><td>  not </td></tr><tr><td>  Sync with smartphone </td><td>  Bluetooth </td><td>  Bluetooth </td><td>  Bluetooth </td></tr><tr><td>  Multicolored straps </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td><td>  Yes </td></tr><tr><td>  Working hours </td><td>  1 year, non-replaceable battery </td><td>  6-7 days </td><td>  5-6 days </td></tr><tr><td>  Price, rubles </td><td>  7130 </td><td>  5990 </td><td>  3990 </td></tr></tbody></table><h1>  Garmin Vivofit </h1>  Unfortunately, this bracelet can not be called elegant or beautiful.  The plastic used is a bit rough and tough - a rather utilitarian device.  Alas, but because of the quality of the plastic, the bracelet cannot be worn out for a long time, it can rub the skin.  Vivofit comes in five colors: gray, black, green, purple or blue.  The set comes with two bracelets of different sizes.  At the same time, this is one of the most protected models on the market - with this bracelet you can dive to a depth of 50 meters.  Naturally, dust and dirt are not afraid of him either.

      Like many other fitness bracelets, the main module with electronics is removable.  The screen is made by electronic ink technology, which has a positive effect on the power consumption of the device and negatively on the color rendition - in this case there is no question even of grayscale.  True, there is still a red graphical indicator. <br><br>  By the way, about power consumption - Vivofit has no connector for recharging, it works on a replaceable battery.  In this case, the manufacturer claims that it lasts for a year (!) Of work.  Thanks to electronic ink, you will not have to peer into the screen in the bright sun, but in the dark you will not see anything at all - the manufacturer has not equipped the bracelet with backlight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c8/e46/b5a/9c8e46b5a64f4149801495e7b6c608ca.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9ab/64b/ea3/9ab64bea347a43f9b9d15a486da9724f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09c/6a5/ae2/09c6a5ae22f345b0a3134e1d7954eea6.jpg"><br><br>  The device itself is equipped with only one control, a button.  She is responsible for switching information display modes.  For communication "with the world" Bluetooth 4.0 is integrated into the bracelet.  Also included is a dongle needed to communicate with a PC.  To read data from the bracelet, you must install a mobile application for Android or iOS, or use the web interface.  The fitness app has quite advanced social tools and allows you to follow the sporting achievements of friends. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa7/ae2/781/aa7ae2781a0644479d466ef8ce0d6473.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cfe/0ef/fb2/cfe0effb2a144ec286105696bc913788.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a9/397/e71/7a9397e71011438fa9df825e41aea0c9.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/293/355/54e/29335554e0df43ada44b113a3ab5122e.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f94/303/cd8/f94303cd8444466b8130642f155f73e6.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f79/741/f9f/f79741f9f0664e35aadec2c26cb05b87.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aab/50a/68b/aab50a68b37c42f1872e52bf96463ce0.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ae/8ee/761/4ae8ee761db74015b0c1dce7798e45bc.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b7b/bda/803/b7bbda803ded470388c9d0fe808ac117.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/60e/a19/682/60ea196820294c70bd0be371c1aa1b4e.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c67/a83/606/c67a836063204969bcfd73b11bd6eda9.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/000/cd6/469/000cd64693c949429054bd515732c48e.jpg"><br><br>  For the physical activity shown by the owner of the bracelet, points are awarded.  If the device considers that the host has stayed behind, then the above-mentioned red indicator turns on, as if hinting that it is time to move <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25DF%25E3%25EE%25E4%25E8%25F7%25ED%25FB%25E5_%25EC%25FB%25F8%25F6%25FB">musculus gluteus</a> .  In addition to points, you can display the number of calories burned, distance traveled, pulse rate and steps, time and date.  Unlike many other fitness bracelets, Vivofit not only records the activity of the wearer, but also varies the daily rate depending on the level of previous loads.  In addition to the built-in sensors, the bracelet can use an external heartbeat sensor, usually used for serious sports.  Although there is no need for additional sensors in everyday life <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3da/4c9/1ff/3da4c91ff4c2489c9f125adcb20125d0.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96e/f7a/4d9/96ef7a4d93604aa982ab25344728c809.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2de/937/f70/2de937f70e6d4ca2801cfa191d579741.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Huawei Talkband B1 </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/324/77b/195/32477b1955c342e795e4a34a1819631a.jpg"><br><br>  The Chinese decided to stand out from the crowd, introducing additional functionality in the form of a Bluetooth headset into the bracelet.  Of course, this is not as convenient as the traditional "ear" headset, but if this is not at hand or you just play sports, then you can also use the built-in bracelet.  The device comes in two colors - blue or gray.  The material of the case-strap resembles a soft rubber.  The bracelet is comfortable, lightweight, does not rub the skin and at the same time has a nice design.  The device complies with the standard IP57, so it is not recommended to swim with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/962/51a/aed/96251aaedf164a949b7a5eab306b69bc.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36a/a87/609/36aa87609eb7419eb4872c167bfe5c2b.jpg"><br><br>  The main module containing all the stuffing, in combination is the headset.  It is fixed on the latch, and to extract it, just press the button.  The headset is equipped with a vibrating alert, two microphones and has a noise cancellation function. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c6c/a0a/704/c6ca0a7049864a61b8a07f7ddb369d46.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e2b/0e8/02e/e2b0e802e1f741648714d3672cb52037.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da4/079/7e7/da40797e71ce4ac8b3daa36650386bf2.jpg"><br><br>  The device is charging from USB, and for this you do not need an additional cable - the connector is hidden in the strap.  After 2 hours of charging, the bracelet works up to 7-8 days, the battery capacity is 90 mAh. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/215/03a/94c/21503a94cd004ff5b4eb2227c969f401.jpg"><br><br>  The screen is made by OLED technology, the information is readable under a variety of lighting conditions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b40/611/b93/b40611b932bb42a4909b9d4949235e71.jpg"><br><br>  Corporate application that exists in versions for Android and iOS is called TalkBand.  The bracelet can connect via Bluetooth 4.1 or NFC.  Apart from the built-in headset, the rest of the bracelet functionality is traditional: pedometer, calorie counting, sleep timer, ‚Äúsmart‚Äù alarm clock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75d/8f2/87b/75d8f287bacd4244bf265f45f128205e.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/336/0aa/181/3360aa18137b4266aa061d3849e1240d.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c1e/fad/b35/c1efadb35e6149398d04a91d668f2fd1.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/426/368/8b9/4263688b92984d0ea462402f4ad23237.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Sony smartband </h1><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a17/d75/774/a17d757748944fd0ab9acb7acfc8aafa.jpg"><br><br>  The bracelet is presented in a wide range of colors, for every taste.  The silicone strap is comfortable, the device sits easily and unobtrusively on the arm.  As is the case with many other models of bracelets, there is also a removable module with all the electronic filling.  This must be done every time to recharge the device using a standard microUSB cable.  What Sony can not refuse is the non-standard approach to the creation of their devices.  This company has always had its own style in design and engineering solutions.  Often this is expressed in unique connectors, standards, interfaces.  And it is gratifying that this time the Japanese did not go their own way, but equipped the bracelet with a standard microUSB connector. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d15/b3e/dfa/d15b3edfaa2b46a6a54273f33c1e1aaf.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a2b/766/414/a2b7664145be4b7abde9b6cffb4dadfb.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/843/8c8/0ef/8438c80efeda4ec8b47f6e486234a664.jpg"><br><br>  However, in another Sony anyway stood out.  The bracelet does not have a screen, so you can not get information without connecting the device to a smartphone.  SmartBand is equipped with three LEDs designed to display the battery charge level.  On average, the duration of work is 5 days.  The bracelet has a dust and moisture protection, but you should not swim with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/158/9d9/bad/1589d9badf5b43a38a5aa40e6a369d8c.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edb/a14/5de/edba145de9204e76ad3e7123c21b8f7a.jpg"><br><br>  The bracelet works only with Android devices.  If you plan to use it only in conjunction with a Sony smartphone or tablet, then it will be enough to install only the SmartBand application on them.  To work with devices from other manufacturers, you will have to additionally install a couple more programs - Smart Connect and Social Life.  However, it was not possible to install branded software on some smartphones, in particular, on Alcatel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38a/c63/3b5/38ac633b54f24cb8ac0e70fbf7a22de3.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d9/14c/c2b/0d914cc2b6f74d6b8b2d5e44d8566484.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8cb/0f0/f9a/8cb0f0f9a4fc46b0845f2de38b4c9e48.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the lack of a screen, a bracelet can, through vibration, ‚Äúinform‚Äù the owner of phone calls, new messages and notifications.  Using the application, you can choose which events the bracelet should remind. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fd/de0/371/7fdde03719dc4a8faae8652a4339eeaa.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0fd/fe7/02a/0fdfe702ae6c464d8738040192d46ecd.jpg"><br><br>  In conjunction with the device, you can use the proprietary program Lifelog, although this is not mandatory.  Lifelog collects detailed statistics about the user's activities, including sports and entertainment in the form of listening to music or watching videos.  All this information in a visual video can then be presented as an animated video. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0c2/63f/399/0c263f399ecf4bacbeeca34592ee604f.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3e1/798/58c/3e179858cd954ae29c3daa72760aca0a.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f36/b54/fb2/f36b54fb233c471e966dd60a47a89f51.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51e/daa/5cf/51edaa5cf86b452f84364e54878e8c6d.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5fc/f70/3a7/5fcf703a75a44eaaa269956b2dbee866.jpg"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0ee/471/527/0ee4715273b145d39eb53db8cb2004fc.jpg"><br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1>  As you can see, each device has its advantages and disadvantages.  The Garmin bracelet is made coarsely, but very reliable, has a huge duration of work without recharging and motivates to play sports.  The device from Huawei combines a fitness tracker with a wireless headset.  The Sony gadget does not have a display, it works only for Android, but it has advanced accompanying software that allows you to customize alerts over a wide range.  At the same time, Sony and Huawei have a short duration of work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/233901/">https://habr.com/ru/post/233901/</a></p>
