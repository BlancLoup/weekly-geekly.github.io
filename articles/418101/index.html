  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Etymology of IT terms</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The IT industry originated in America, and we all know that terms from this sphere came to Russian from English.  This is quite natural, as well as the fact that the English words were adjusted to the rules of the Russian language: to code became ‚Äúcodify‚Äù, the bug report began to lean (bug reports, bug reports, etc.), and the verb to google, new even for English, we have turned into ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù, ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù, ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù and ‚Äúgoogle‚Äù (with a change in number, face and time).  But how cookies are related to cookies, and why the Macintosh is in no way connected to the raincoat few people know.  Are you familiar with the etymology of IT terms? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/io/su/ki/iosuki__iyqubtpk4pwk4bbrqge.jpeg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Bit and byte </h3><br>  These terms are used by all, even far from the IT-sphere, users, because the "weight" of the file to download is a crucial parameter.  The term bit created by Claude Elvun Shannon in 1948.  In his article "Mathematical Theory of Communication," he proposed using the word bit, created from two words, binary and digit (binary number), to denote the smallest unit of information.  The word byte appeared later, in June 1956.  His creator‚Äôs name is Werner Buchholz, and he coined the word ‚Äúbyte‚Äù to designate the unit of measure for information during the creation of the IBM 7030. <br><br><h3>  Bug </h3><br>  Many have heard the story of a moth that burned between two contacts in a Harvard Mark II computer relay, which caused a software error.  Then Grace Hopper, who worked with the machine, found the poor guy and removed it, returning the "Harvard" performance, and the find attached to a technical journal, providing with the inscription: "The first real case of detection of a bug."  But in fact, the word bug meant technical problems long before the birth of computers: the same Thomas Edison, who created the phonograph and worked with the telegraph, telephone, and other equipment, called the bug word "minor errors and difficulties" at work.

    <h3>  Cookie </h3><br>  Perhaps the sweetest term.  And he really connected with cookies.  It all started with Unix programmers, who described a small set of data passed from one program to another by the phrase magic cookie.  In 1994, the programmer Lou Mantulli, when creating the Netscape browser, created cookies (or cookies), borrowing the name from colleagues.  In both cases, the prediction cookies were a source of inspiration. <br><br><h3>  Mac </h3><br>  Everyone knows Macintosh OS, but not everyone knows why it is called that way, and where does the apple, because the word "mac" in Russian means "waterproof rubberized raincoat."  It's very simple: the name comes from the word McIntosh, which means a sort of red apples. <br><br><h3>  Python and spam </h3><br>  Think nothing in common?  No, both of these words came from Monty Python‚Äôs popular British show Flying Circus.  Actually, the programming language is named after the show itself.  But the spam appeared thanks to a sketch with the same name.  The couple comes to the restaurant and starts to pick the dishes meticulously, but all the menu items contain SPAM - canned meat.  The waitress lists the dishes available: first, these are the usual names, and then practically "spam with spam, filled with spam."  Sketch just fell on the days of Usenet, where there were annoying advertisers who interfered with communication.  And by analogy with the already well-known and beloved joke, the phrase ‚Äúspamming up the dialogue‚Äù appeared, that is, putting so much unnecessary advertising on it that it becomes difficult to communicate.  So, the word "spam" still means unsolicited and annoying ads. <br><br><h3>  Java </h3><br>  Of all the programming languages, Java has one of the most interesting names in terms of etymology.  Initially, this language wore a laconic name, D, but James Gosling, his creator, decided to rename it Oak (the oak) - the D letter had a lot of associations with school grades.  In America, marks are put in letters, where A is an analogue of our ‚Äúfive‚Äù, and D, you know, is not the most impressive result.  But James did not take into account that programmers at Sun Microsystems Inc.  already used a language called Oak.  James suggested other options, and the method of busting the language gave the name "Java".  Why?  Because in English this word meant coffee, especially the one that grew up on the island of Java, and programmers, they say, drink a lot of coffee.  Why then is the language called "Java" and not "Java"?  Because the name of this language came from English, where it is pronounced exactly as ‚ÄúJava‚Äù.  By the way, many people think that this is an acronym, but one of its creators has denied it.  Java is not an acronym, and each letter of it does not mean anything, however (and here it is unexpected), if you so want to believe that there is a secret in the word, the creators offer the Just Just Vague Acronym option (‚Äúone more strange acronym‚Äù). <br><br><h3>  Oracle </h3><br>  No less interesting is the story of Orakla, a relational database management system.  Initially, its creators worked for the CIA, and the project was codenamed Oracle, Oracle.  Probably, the CIA agents believed that Oracle will give answers to all questions.  The project was completed, but the creators decided to finalize the database and show it to the world. <br><br><h3>  Ubuntu </h3><br>  The name of this operating system is borrowed from African languages ‚Äã‚Äãand means ‚Äúhumanity‚Äù.  Philosophy Ubuntu pays special attention to loyalty to others.  It is interesting that there are no more operating systems that would have such a specific name.  The same Windows and Linux do not carry any philosophical burden. <br><br><h3>  Worm </h3><br>  Science fiction is the engine of progress.  Anything that science fiction writers compose for their works, sooner or later becomes a reality.  So it was with the "worm".  The name for this malware was borrowed from the novel John Brunner "Riders of the Shock Wave", written in 1975 already.  There are some ‚Äútapeworms‚Äù, special programs that spread across the network and delete data.  Naturally, this name did not pass unnoticed: the programmers immediately adopted it <br><br><h3>  Bot </h3><br>  This word is an example of apocopy, that is, truncation.  The term originally sounded like internet robot or web / WWW robot.  But over time, all the excess has fallen off, and a simple and understandable ‚Äúbot‚Äù has remained in use. <br><br><h3>  Log </h3><br>  Despite the fact that in English the word ‚Äúlog‚Äù is a homonym of this word, the ‚Äúlog‚Äù familiar to IT people has nothing to do with logs.  This term has existed since the 17th century, when the word log meant the ship‚Äôs log. <br><br><h3>  File </h3><br>  Why is the file actually called a file?  It turns out that this word is not one hundred years old.  It came into English from French around the 1520s and immediately acquired the meaning of "thread or cable on which documents are attached."  One hundred years later, the word slightly changed its meaning and began to signify neatly collected paper documents, among which you can quickly find the right one.  And only in 1954 the word file came to the world of information technology. <br><br><h3>  Nerd </h3><br>  And finally - why are the nerds called nerds?  This word came into use in the student's environment, but no one really knows where it came from.  There is a version that this is a modified word nert, which was in use in the 1940s and meant "stupid / insane person."  Nert, in turn, could come from nut, which still means "strange, crazy."  For certain, one thing is known: the first time this word appeared in the book of the popular writer Theodore Syuz Geisel ‚ÄúIf I Managed the Zoo‚Äù, and, probably, from there it went to the masses. <br><br>  Learn English with <a href="https://puzzle-english.com/%3Ftid%3Dhabr">Puzzle English</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418101/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418101/</a></p>
