      This is the second part of the advice of Victor, the first <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/18488/">is here</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  I think many people have recently noticed such a ‚Äúkarmic‚Äù environment of the global Internet market and automation, namely, absolute - anti-professionalism in the Internet professions.  How many people are now working online, no one can say for sure, but I think that is not enough. <br><br>  250,000 people?  350,000 people?  500k?  Fingers is not enough for sure! </blockquote><br><h4>  How Much Is The Fish </h4><br><blockquote>  You know, but this does not please me for many reasons, because  most of the people from this giant queue do not understand what they are doing in this obscurantism.  Yes, after a series of feature films it has become fashionable to work on Internet and generally to be connected at least somehow with the global network (especially with social networks), but what happens at this moment with those people who really support technology and do not want to compete with it Pseudo-specialist pasture? <br><br>  In an example: <br><br>  Professional journalism was killed by errand boys, who simply copy and paste everything that others write.  I don‚Äôt propose to cut out these malicious consumers of content, like the ‚Äúguests‚Äù of Moscow deal with the residents of Russia, but I think it‚Äôs time to clean the organizations from non-professional people in their places. <br><br>  Of course, it is very difficult to do this and this will require huge resources, but now imagine what will be the outcome of such actions from all entrepreneurs and business owners?  Users will be satisfied with high-quality content and will be less worried about the fact that their application does not perform the declared functionality, and Internet companies themselves will be able to hold out stronger in the market without additional investments in marketing. <br><br>  What happened to the market today is difficult to name, but the situation is very strange and deplorable.  Virtually any girl who has learned how to type text on the keyboard considers herself a professional in her field and gets a job in any publication.  Any boy who wrote ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù fancies himself a programmer and even more so a developer. <br><br>  If this is only the beginning of a global degradation, then it's time to send money to the SpaceX startup, so that Ilon Musk could build a rocket to move people to Mars. <br><br>  Of course, many will write that this is a very controversial topic and many of these people will become great, but it is hard to believe ... Ask ... for example, Arkady Volozh or Igor Ashmanov.  How did it develop during the first wave of the Internet?  I think that hardly any of them will say that they just "took it and got what they wanted."  Look carefully at these people and their biography.  They were not "clerks" and did not exactly think to get rich immediately. </blockquote><br><h4>  I will give a real example from the organization building </h4><br><blockquote>  In organization A, they hired 1 professional and 5 loafers who can do nothing except how to post "seals" on social networks.  What happens to one pro through time?  Yes, correctly caught!  He will say - "And did not you all go to drink smoothies ... I have nothing to do here."  As a result, a person leaves and falls into the ‚Äújob search‚Äù job search cycle, but what happens to an organization in such conditions, because these 5 loafers think that - guys!  Our time has come and it's time to be the boss.  As a result, for 3 years in organization A there are only lazy people.  Why? <br><br>  <b>1</b> - Lobotryas can not determine the professionalism of the candidate <br><br>  <b>2</b> - Lobotryas afraid that he will be humiliated by mental superiority <br><br>  <b>3</b> - A professional feels that his hunt is lazy and says at once - would you not go to the bathhouse! <br><br>  I am not inclined to depress and mandrazhirovat problems of the common market, but in truth I am afraid of such hrenaten.  After all, now it is in fashion not to be Gagarin of his work, it is not fashionable to be a geek who is afraid to put in a word about his invention.  Now it has become a trend to shout everywhere that we have made such products that Nipple + attracted a lot of money, i.e.  (borrowed a bunch of shekels from everywhere). <br><br>  I am 100% sure that most people who read this post will understand me and say.  Listen, this guy is right!  It's time to act!  Therefore, the main message for those who did not want to delve into this post: <br><br>  The Internet is not an industry or a vacuum cleaner, where everyone can get from the street and without experience.  Here, at a minimum, you need to work hard and earn trust, but the worst thing in all of this is the desire to get rich quickly, which completely kills the guarantee that the contractor will fulfill the directive on time. </blockquote><br>  <i>Editorial note: if you have a desire to participate in the ‚ÄúFounder‚Äôs Tips‚Äù section, write to us at editor (at) megamozg.ru</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/293998/">https://habr.com/ru/post/293998/</a></p>
