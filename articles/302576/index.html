Day 2: Turning dreams into reality (part 2)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aaf/08b/2f7/aaf08b2f7c314f29bcb7592e9e0e940c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>In <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/obzor-seminara-toni-robbinsa-osvobodite-vnutrennyuyu-silu-den-2-prevrashchenie-grez-v-realnost-chast/">previous publications,</a> we have already considered many important moments for personal growth and development, which Tony Robbins spoke about.</i>  <i>And now we offer to understand the <b>types of motivation</b> and important <b>features of teamwork</b></i> . <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Tony Robbins explained that there are two types of motivation: <br>  <b>1)</b> pushing <br>  <b>2)</b> attraction. <br><br>  Pushing is manifested in the fact that you constantly ‚Äúkick‚Äù and connect discipline and willpower <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/5-sposobov-ostavatsya-sosredotochennym-v-mire-polnom-otvlekayushchikh-faktorov/">to achieve the goal</a> .  But will power and discipline are NOT ETERNAL, and as a result you fade.  That is why many people fail: they HIT the result, but it only works for a few days, weeks or months. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"

      <br>
      The key is to use motivation based on attraction.  It manifests itself in the fact that you literally THINK to the goal.  It does not require discipline or willpower, because you WANT to do what is necessary to achieve the goal.  You are changing the DUTY to do this at DESIRE. <br><br>  The fact is that in life there are certain things to which we are drawn, which we love to do.  For example, I like to go to the gym and do the exercises.  For this I need neither discipline nor willpower.  In fact, they are required by me to NOT go to the gym - I literally get sick if I have to skip the workout.  For me, this is an example of motivation-ATTRACT. <br><br>  I am drawn to exercise, because: <br><br>  <b>1)</b> it meets my needs; <br>  <b>2)</b> this coincides with my beliefs / values; <br>  <b>3)</b> I have an attractive dream and an understanding of why I need this. <br><br>  But there is another thing that can ‚Äúpull‚Äù us to the result or goal.  Tony Robbins shared an effective method of creating such motivation-attraction.  We form it using the feelings and sensations that would have arisen if we had already achieved a goal or result, and then LOST what we wanted. <br><br>  The strategy used in the exercise is simple: if we HAVE HAD something, and then it was taken away from us, then naturally we begin to gravitate towards it again.  For example, if you are accustomed to a mobile phone, and one day I say: ‚ÄúNo cellular phones, you should use a payphone‚Äù, then you WILL FIND A WAY to reclaim the device, because you already had it. <br><br>  This method is phenomenal and definitely one of my favorite episodes of the second day. <br><br>  The second day of the seminar ‚ÄúFree your inner strength‚Äù gave a lot of other lessons, impressions and moments.  I would need an eternity to tell in detail about all this.  But I would like to share brief descriptions of some other concepts and ideas. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">The path to prosperity: the basis of emotional fitness</font> </h3><br>  In the review of the first day of the seminar ‚ÄúUnleashThePowerWithin‚Äù I talked about the emotional triad.  Whether you are in the right state or not is determined by whether you have an attractive future (the reason for using your skills) and what your self-perception is (we do not do what we can, but act, guided by our own opinions about ourselves). <br><br>  This episode seemed interesting to me, because in my life there were cases when I KNEW that I SHOULD get the right mood, but my feelings didn‚Äôt correspond to it.  And it always happened because of the absence of one of the two keys mentioned. <br>  One must always have a dream or an attractive future, something to strive for.  Without it, you will just sit back.  Without a fascinating horizon there is no movement.  Your self-perception is usually the sum of beliefs about who you are.  This is how you define yourself.  It is important that the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãyourself and your essence is inspiring, because it determines how you will act. <br><br>  The greatest moving layer of the human person is the need to conform to their own opinion about themselves. <br><br><h3>  <font color="#0071c5">Team strength</font> </h3><br>  Tony Robbins said that the secret of well-being and happiness lies in becoming a team player. <br><br>  Speaking of "team", Tony Robbins meant: the key is to perceive each person as part of his team or family.  It does not matter if we are talking about a passerby serving you in a restaurant as a waiter or as your abuser.  According to Tony, you should acquire two beliefs concerning people: <br><ul><li>  people do everything in their power using the resources they have; </li><li>  There are no mediocre people, there is only an unproductive attitude. </li></ul><br>  You always want to see good in others and understand that they are trying their best to manage the resources available to them.  Moreover, if someone is angry or offends you, you know: this is due to the fact that he is in a NON-PRODUCTIVE CONDITION. <br><br>  Both of these beliefs are important.  Tony notes that most people are miserable and poor because they are focused on themselves.  Power always comes to those who are sincere in their ministry.  The more actively and often you take care of your team, the more energy you have.  Your level of consciousness can be measured by the number of people you care for. <br><br>  <b>Happiness is always a consequence of progress.</b>  <b>Development manifests itself in the form of growth and sacrifice.</b> <br><br>  Who you spend time with, <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/7-povodov-prinyat-izmeneniya/">you become</a> .  If you want to change your life, then you should start with those who surround you, because they affect your essence more than anything else.  If you strive to grow and get what you want, be sure to gather around you people playing at a higher level.  Find a team that will provoke and push you towards development, and not the one in which everything is simple and convenient.  If you feel good and comfortable, you will not grow. <br>  Before I finish, I want to list a few vivid quotes from my journal. <br><ul><li>  Human beings will do more for others than for themselves. </li><li>  The more actively and carefully you take care of your team, the more energy you have. </li><li> Treat well those who do wrong with you.  It <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/chtoby-stat-liderom-dlya-drugikh-stante-snachala-liderom-dlya-sebya/">makes you a leader</a> , not a slave. </li><li>  Keep in touch with humanity.  Everyone is a member of your team. </li><li>  If the people coming to you are tense, it has nothing to do with you, they are simply offended.  Give them a gift or change their mood.  Ask yourself: ‚ÄúWhat is this person going through?‚Äù </li><li>  You can eat or make miracles. </li><li>  Life will pay you as much as you ask. </li></ul><br>  So the second day of the seminar ‚ÄúFree your inner strength‚Äù ends with Tony Robbins and Joseph McClendon III.  It was a great day! <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/10-sposobov-izmenitsya-k-luchshemu-ne-menyaya-svoe-myshlenie/">10 ways to change for the better without changing your thinking</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302576/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302576/</a></p>
