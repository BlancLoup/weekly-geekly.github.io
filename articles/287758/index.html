Molodechno scientists conducted a series of experiments on hamsters and found out that these furry animals absolutely up to the lantern, that over the last week appeared interesting in blogs.  So let's not be like stupid animals, which place in a three-liter jar, and proceed directly to the review. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is the subway for us, except for a convenient means of transportation?  Well, yes, in some respects - a way of life.  How much time do we spend per week on the subway?  And during the time that the train spends in the tunnel, the passengers next to us are getting closer and nicer.  But there is a certain category of passengers, let's call them conditionally "metro-grandmother", which does not become nicer under any circumstances.  So the Mouse shocked <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_metro/2381652.html">tells</a> in the community ru_metro the story of the surrender of the metro station.  Although for some reason it seems to me that such a story could not have happened in the Minsk metro.

      The first Moscow international conference ‚ÄúBlogs, new media and civic journalism‚Äù was held on March 21 at MGIMO (U) of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia, reports <a href="http://www.bel.ru/news/society/2007/03/26/23434.html">Bel.ru news agency</a> .  Journalists from different regions of Russia and Ukraine, as well as from the USA, Korea, Kazakhstan and other countries took part in its work.  According to the organizers of the forum, "the <em>science of the Internet is impossible, since there is no well-established system of concepts. The Internet is constantly revolutionizing and has the unique property of escaping</em> ."  Nevertheless, the conference turned out to be unusually saturated with both theory and practice.  As Dmitry Peskov, director of the Internet Policy Center at MGIMO, noted at the plenary meeting, such an open conference format is not very common for a university of international relations.  In particular, he recalled: " <em>4-5 years ago, our system administrators closed the students access to the LiveJournal</em> ." <br><br>  Blogs further and more resemble the walkers of grannies on a bench at the entrance, seeking to criticize and discuss everyone around, tell about the latest rumors, remember the past and so on and so forth, which is usually characteristic only of the favorite forum ‚ÄúKV‚Äù and me.  So the journalist-girl decided to make fun of the famous bloggers-writers in her article ‚Äú <a href="http://eli-d.livejournal.com/1046.html">Hello, Pushkin!</a> ‚Äù (I hope the editor will not correct the title).  Although the competence of the author, too, can be questioned for the ease with which she puts in serious writers Coelho.  The girl imagines herself to be a great marketer of publishing and tells the public what is worthy of publishing and what is not.  Moreover, this is such a wonderful dexterity of the brain - to smear with plasticine almost all known bloggers.  Even I have such a trick is unlikely to succeed, but I try, believe me.  Here is a quotation from this note: ‚Äú <em>From the vastness of the blogosphere, mediocre grafomanals climb into the big literature, believing that a couple of positive reviews are the desired‚Äú ticket to life. ‚ÄùAlong with serious literature, creative searches of bloggers that represent the value of an eighth-grader‚Äôs diary fall into books showcases and bestseller lists receive awards and regalia. Sometimes deservedly, if we are talking about the literary anti-award ‚ÄúFull paragraph‚Äù solemnly awarded to violators of all norms and rules</em> . ‚Äù <br><br>  The millionth online diary was created on the project <a href="http://blogs.mail.ru/">Blogi@Mail.Ru</a> .  The number of users who have touched the blogging world through Blogi@Mail.Ru exceeds the number of registered Russian users of the popular blog hosting LiveJournal.com twice - they boast to us in numbers in the newspaper <a href="http://www.newizv.ru/news/2007-03-27/66384">Novye Izvestia</a> .  Yes, let it be at least ten times!  Where is the quality?  Have you seen in my reviews at least one link to the blog, which is located on the mail.ru site?  And why?  Because there is not interesting!  Though there are a million of them. <br><br>  " <a href="http://pantherclaw.livejournal.com/342059.html">About star blogs</a> " - in this article (you would not believe it!) We are told about the blogs that famous people lead.  Personally, I was interested in athletes blogs.  It turned out that among this profession there is not only ‚Äúand I also eat into it‚Äù, but also people who know how to form their thoughts in a beautiful text.  And just people who have at least some thoughts.  In addition to links to blogs, in the text, be sure to read the comments - there are many additions.  In addition, there are links to diaries of foreign stars, so you are sure to pick up a blog to your liking. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.blogsticker.com/">Blogsticker</a> website invites everyone to ‚Äúpaste over‚Äù your blog with sticker images - stickers.  Stickers - all the same size - you can choose from different categories and add to the top right corner of the blog.  Themes are the most diverse, including Indiana Jones and The Family Guy.  The sticker leads to a link to the site Blogsticker, which displays a list of all the blogs that host the same.  Similar services are in Pixsy - photo widgets for MySpace, and in Zingfu - photo masks. <br><br>  In the last review, I told you about a bot program that can independently create blog posts and respond to comments adequately.  Of course, the message contained a bit of misinformation and even deliberate misrepresentation.  But here on the following link you will read the story about the real nest of LJ robots, which is still functioning!  " <em>As a wise and subtle man, nl says that it is a sin to produce stupid spam bots. And, of course, he is right. But to me, a blunt and cheeky man, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãplaying with robots seemed interesting. Therefore, I made a nest on PHP for robots With the online interface where the login is started, the Yandex Search line and the response methods and other settings are entered. After that, the bot starts working automatically. It turned out that the most difficult (for a long time) is to get a separate LJ login for the bot. is set up at the moment,</em> "- Leo makes a <a href="http://lleo.aha.ru/dnevnik/2007/03/20.html">shocking admission</a> on his blog  Nid Kaganov.  And indeed, in some comments I have met the actions of the described robots.  And I agree with the author in his concerns about the future of the Internet, which will be flooded with robots.  Artificial intelligence comes from where no one really expected it. <br><br>  As an additional boost to the situation after the previous paragraph, get the next one.  Blogs and other web resources where users are allowed to send messages are increasingly becoming victims of spammers: automatic programs fill resources with links to pornographic sites, including trojanized ones.  Such a warning issued by the British antivirus company Sophos.  In its message, the company gives an example of how the news site forums from the Philippines, Newsbreak, have been filled with 27 thousand links to porn sites.  Now imagine that the robots described above will go to spammers.  Although, I think, spammers already have similar developments, only in the Russian-speaking segment of the Internet they do not apply - we are poor, there will be no return. <br><br>  A few news from the little-known search engine "Yandex".  In the form of an <a href="">advanced blog search</a> from ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù (which is still in the testing phase), now the opportunity has been added to search in friends (friend tape) form item: ‚ÄúSearch in a friend's friends‚Äù.  Moreover, the friend search form <a href="">can</a> now <a href="">be set to your blog</a> .  At the moment, the search is carried out in three services: LiveJournal.com, LiveInternet.ru and Diary.ru.  But, as can be seen from the <a href="">official message of</a> ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù, they are not going to stop at this and ask to connect additional blogs by sending messages about the desire to the address support@blogs.yandex.ru. <br><br>  An interesting statistical study conducted by Yandex.  In February, the algorithm for calculating the Internet index changed at the Yandex.Cities project: the company decided that blogs were a rather important indicator of Internet activity, so bloggers ‚Äôbehavior should somehow be taken into account.  In the process of choosing the appropriate characteristics of the urban blogosphere, there have been many experiments on various resulting dependencies.  As a result, we decided to use the number of posts in blogs from this city for a month, referred to the number of Internet users there, as an indicator of the activity of urban bloggers.  In a study of the blogosphere, analysts at Yandex noted that bloggers are most active in large cities.  Therefore, it became interesting to build the dependence of this metric: the number of posts per capita of the Internet population of the city - on the size of the city itself.  <a href="">The result was a picture</a> where the city‚Äôs population in millions of inhabitants is plotted on the horizontal axis, and the activity of urban bloggers on the vertical axis (the activity of Muscovites is taken as 100%).  It turned out that, on average, the trend is confirmed.  But here two points very strongly deviate from the average picture for cities with a population of less than 2 million people, these points belong to Odessa and Pskov.  Odessa ejection does not cause much surprise: Odessans are famous for talkativeness and love for colorful verbal self-expression.  But Pskov all amazed.  Not a single city of Belarus, unfortunately, is indicated on the graph. <br><br>  I will finish the review with a story about the movement of the homeless.  What do the bums have to do with blogs?  Oh, the most immediate!  They make money blogging!  On this occasion, read the wonderful and very detailed article on <a href="http://www.seonews.ru/article/.publication/245">SEOnew.ru</a> .  Quote: " <em>If you ignore the ideological differences, the" homeless "simply merge in the eyes of the researcher: they earn in the same ways, they host blogs on one platform, read Kiyosaki, criticize prices and economics with politics, in general. Apparently, this is a portrait of a businessman A new wave. How soon will it overwhelm the entire IT and SEO community? It's interesting to watch</em> .
