  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Social network for google</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I voiced this idea in comments, but after detailed deliberation, it seems to me more and more elegant. <br><br>  Obviously, Google already has social networks.  Google Reader, Blogger, Buzz, Picasa, YouTube ... Almost every Google product has a social element.  However, none has achieved success (except, perhaps, YouTube, but you can hardly call it a social network, rather it‚Äôs a video blogging service).  Why is that? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  IMHO, because in order to be introduced into a new social network, users have to make efforts with no visible effect for a certain period of time.  Write to nowhere.  Even if Google receives a Facebook social graph, it will not help him much, because even if the user has 50 Google-friends, he will be too lazy not only to write something on the Google network, but even to check the news there - Why, if 2/3 of them will initially be crossposts from other, still used social sites? 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Thus, for the explosive success of a social network, you need to make it so that a) users fill it with content, without wasting effort on it, and b) that users see it all the time whenever possible.  But Google constantly gets a huge amount of content from its users!  These are search queries. <br><br>  These constructions of two or three words carry a lot of information (as you know, the right question is half the answer).  I suppose everyone remembers a funny game from Google, in which you had to guess the historical face of search queries.  Quite often, screenshots of Google-hints run through various humorous resources. <br><br>  So, on the main Google, from the right edge (where there is now an empty space), there appears a neat ‚Äúyour friends were looking for‚Äù block.  It can even be static, without Ajax - the dynamic page opens with a click.  There - a sort of tweets, only created from search queries.  There is a button search this (in fact - retweet), there is no possibility of a replay, instead of it - comments. <br><br>  Similar requests made in a short period of time are grouped.  if a request is repeated day after day, the user is asked not to publish it anymore (for those who are looking for Google VKontakte).  Naturally, at the time of the request, it is possible to refuse to publish, the default behavior is configurable.  You can even create a subdomain simple.google.com, which by default will not publish anything and where there will be no tape. <br><br>  The policy of franding is aimed at the most rapid expansion of the circle of friends.  When adding a new friend, you must enter the captcha (or even confirm this action by e-mail), but after person A has added person B as friend, B will see the posts A in his tape until he turns him off .  Spammers are eliminated by draconian measures when adding friends - this is not so scary, users do it not so often. <br><br>  Subsequently, you can add integration with other Google services - when the network stabilizes and certain rules are established in it.  The main thing is that Google has been actively writing a huge audience since the launch, competently using its main, most popular service. <br><br>  Naturally, this is crazy.  Naturally, this is another attack on privacy (although all on a voluntary basis).  But - it will be a new word in social networks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/108698/">https://habr.com/ru/post/108698/</a></p>
