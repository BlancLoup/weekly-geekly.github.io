  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About introverts in IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><p>  After I wrote <a href="https://habr.com/en/post/452372/">this post</a> , I noticed that most of the comments turned to the introverted part.  This is all the more surprising that I specifically left this part short enough, considering it not so important for my narration.  It turns out that I was wrong, and this topic just needs discussion.  Well, I hasten to improve. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1 id="disclaimer">  Disclaimer </h1><br><p>  First of all, I would like to say that in the previous post I allowed myself a rather categorical statement against introverts in IT, which caused a small squall of quite constructive criticism in my address in the comments.  Of course, I did not mean that introverts in our business have no place, but only wanted to show what difficulties, in my opinion, they could face in this field.  However, I feel the need to apologize to all those whose feelings I have touched, so I apologize. </p><br><h1 id="a-v-introvertah-li-delo">  Is introverts the case? </h1><br><p>  Immediately I would like to make another reservation.  One of the first and, in my opinion, the most constructive comments said that it was too rough to divide people only into introverts and extroverts.  Very correct words.  The point is not at all in the type of character, but rather in how much a person is ready to contact with others.  At the same time, I deliberately try to avoid using the term "sociable", because, generally speaking, it is not a matter of communication.  It's not so important if we can chat with you over a cup of coffee.  It is much more important that you can be approached in case of need and ask some technical question and this does not get you off track. </p><br><p>  Here I would also like to mention the comments that there is no one to work in the extrovert team, everyone can only scratch languages.  The author of this record makes the same mistake: it too roughly divides people into two groups.  Of course, there are developers who are not able to write anything themselves.  Their code is born only by copy-paste with stackoverflow or typing under the dictation of a colleague.  I do not see such comrades for two reasons: firstly, I hope that there are few such people, and secondly, the problem here does not seem to be sociable at all. </p><br><h1 id="i-vse-zhe-introverty-ili-ekstraverty">  And yet introverts or extraverts? </h1><br><p>  So, after all of the above, I would like to say what I had in mind in my previous post.  As already mentioned, I did not mean that introverts do not belong in IT.  I just wanted to say that uncommunicative people can expect certain difficulties here.  It is important to understand that modern development, as a rule, goes in teams and will have to interact with his comrades in arms.  In different teams in different ways, but often this implies a rather tight interaction.  To this application, I may want to argue a commentator, who noticed that in a small business, as a rule, developers do isolated tasks, which reduces interaction with the team to a minimum.  Here I agree, but only in part.  Yes, this is probably true (I have to admit that I haven‚Äôt been able to work in a small business), however, in my opinion, almost any small business has exactly two ways: to expand if their product becomes popular, or to close otherwise (I know only one exception and it is connected with the severely limited number of consumers).  In both cases, developers risk being in large and tightly interacting teams, either at the same place of work or at a new one. </p><br><p>  It is also important to remember that many developers, gaining sufficient experience, try to occupy more intellectually capacious and highly paid positions of team leaders, architects and others.  Most of them suggest a very close interaction with many people, which can prevent those of us who are uncomfortable with communication. </p><br><h1 id="kogo-zhe-brat">  Whom to take? </h1><br><p>  And yet, is the nature of the applicant important or are only technical skills important?  In my opinion, both are important.  At the same time, there is no ‚ÄúIT-oriented‚Äù character.  All the developers are good and here they are already solving the ‚Äúhard skills‚Äù, however it is important to understand that a pronounced introvert is hardly comfortable in the extraverts team and vice versa.  Therefore, much more important is not so much the character of the interviewee, as how much he will fit into your team.  It sounds trite, but you should not forget about it, because otherwise you run the risk of getting difficulties in the team from scratch. </p><br><p>  I would like to ask developers not to disdain to seek advice from my colleagues (but also not to abuse it) and give such advice when they ask you to.  Often this can save your comrades a lot of time.  Stuffing your own bumps is, of course, a useful activity, but it is not always worth the time spent. </p></div>
