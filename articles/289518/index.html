      This has long been a stereotype that has broken about modernity. <br><br>  Of course, the employee wants to have a decent salary and development.  But today, companies offer something more - from social benefits to entire recreation areas.  Correspondingly, the requests are also increasing. <br><br>  Why does an employer need it?  If a half-specialist is not sitting in front of his pants, but a really valuable worker is to keep him.  Make it work in this company. <br><br>  How to achieve this? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Job</b> <br><br>  <i>Company as a place of professional development</i> <br><br>  <b>Indicate career growth and reward system</b> <br><br>  Often, finding a job, the employee does not understand what the future holds for him in this company.  No need to be a psychic - it is important to understand the prospects for development and ways to achieve the goal. <br><br>  When I got a job, I wanted to be hired and appointed a good salary.  And much less thought about what would happen to me here in a year or two.  How can I get a raise, what salary I will get. <br><br>  It is good when the company has a clear system of motivation, even if only to the main department.  Not ‚Äúin a year or two or five you may grow to be a leading manager,‚Äù but a clear scheme with exact figures and results. <br><br>  For example, we wrote it down in the employment contract and on the stand at the entrance - so that we would not forget. <br><br>  Let's talk about bonuses. <br><br>  An unexpected bonus is, of course, pleasant.  The element of surprise is great, yes.  But what if the bonus system is made more transparent? <br><br>  It doesn‚Äôt matter if they are cash rewards, appliances or cars.  Let the employees know for what achievements they will get a new Apple or a machine of a certain class.  So the employee is more diligently striving for a clear goal. <br><br>  <b>friendship</b> <br><br>  <i>The employer as a reliable support</i> <br><br>  <b>Offer social package and support</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/673/215/e3f/673215e3f44843f3a5906b8cbf970dbd.png"><br><br>  On this subject there is a lot of controversy.  Someone thinks that it is not worth spending the company money on social benefits for employees (there is a salary), someone is in favor of a wide range of social services - after all, it forms a positive image of the company. <br><br>  I am personally for the second option.  Try to become a social support for employees, and you will get a good return.  This may be LCA.  It will be better to be treated - will be less sick.  :) <br><br>  In our company, we offered employees a paid summer vacation.  Trips to Turkey or Bulgaria - flights and accommodation.  It came in handy for them during the crisis. <br><br>  <b>Love</b> <br><br>  <i>Employer and rapprochement with the team</i> <br><br>  <b>Organize corporate and company culture</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cad/ea7/0b2/cadea70b25d040699659b316dfff0e24.png"><br><br>  This item is loved by many.  Corporate parties and holidays are not just a reason to have fun, this is communication with the team.  Such things create a warm atmosphere in the company.  If people like to work together - work becomes more pleasant.  If not, then the matter is no longer corporate. <br><br>  Also try to introduce some interesting culture specifically for your company.  For example, regular trips to the nature, film screenings - whatever. <br><br>  In Intellina we actively support the sport.  We offer free ice hockey training, a fitness club, in the winter - skiing and snowboarding, and in the summer - football.  And in the kitchen with us you can always make yourself fresh juice. <br><br>  There is a lot of room for imagination.  Fall in love with an employee in the company in all respects! <br><br>  <i>What are you doing as an employee?</i>  <i>As an employer?</i>  <i>What is important to you at work?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289518/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289518/</a></p>
