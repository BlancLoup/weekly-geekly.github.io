      <b>07/02/2008</b> Wednesday: calling again ... Tratata, again everything is the same, but this time at the end I was told, yes, I'm sorry, there are some problems in your area, the Internet will be today or tomorrow, if you don‚Äôt show up - call. <br><br>  <b>Today is</b> Thursday, I sit at work and think of how to send them home after arrival and break the contract (the support itself is not to blame for the support, and for this reason I don‚Äôt want to shout at them). <br><br>  <i>Afterword: Neighboring Net has been done by the Internet almost the very first day (06/30/2008), it turned out that the electricians cut the cable and I did it too, I would have done it myself, but I basically refuse C.</i> <br><br>  <b>UPDATED</b> <br><br>  For curiosity, I decided to once again ring out, but I clearly decided for myself that if TP continued to portray the mountain, then Magomed would just score. <br><br>  I find it funny and I laugh hard.  I got a very adequate girl, and I repeated the whole story with my head, noticed 5 times, said that I know what the problem is - I cut the cable (I got up myself checked it is, I didn‚Äôt twist it because I definitely refuse C) , the conversation with her came to an end at about the 15th minute with the award of the cherished bid, went to the second level of support. <br><br>  The young man said that he would check the equipment right now, the equipment check ended on the 25th minute. <br>  ‚ÄúYou know, we found out you have <b>a cable break</b> .‚Äù <br>  - "Yes, laaaadno !!!! ????  Is it true? ‚Äù <br>  -"Yes.  Now let's assign you technicians. ‚Äù <br><br>  Out of money on the phone ... (I do not have a city).  <b>25 minutes (TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES)</b> , talk for about 5 minutes of them, the rest is equipment testing, finding out that I have a cable cut and recording the application text.  Naturally, no one called me back.  Naturally, no one will come, and you need to call%).  Well, this is not at any gate, honestly ... <br><br>  In the end: I refuse, refuse, knowing that I am not proving anything and remain apparently in the cold, but ... And any other Corbiner who reads this right now thinks that he is with whom, but he will not touch him, well, let him lucky. <br><br>  <i>PS</i> <i><br></i>  <i>1. As far as I know, the work of TP services is Service Desk software.</i>  <i>So what, calling from the same number, ask me the same questions?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>2. Do you give a number in the zone of 8-800, or do you think that the Snow Maiden calls the service (8-800 there), but not to Corbin?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>3. Again about the neighbor, I could tell you how everything was there, how he was called back, repaired on the same day and in general.</i> <br><br>  <b>Dear Corbin, filling this topic with many mistakes and misprints, an unknown person corrected them for me (thanks), because I‚Äôm still illiterate, I know that you don‚Äôt give a damn about one of the millions (you don‚Äôt need, you don‚Äôt need to convince me every opinion is important to you), and in general, nothing will change.</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/28436/">https://habr.com/ru/post/28436/</a></p>
