And then - to determine the importance of certain factors when ranking these sites on Google.  In 2013, websites that appear on top SERP pages combine strong social signals.  Among the approximately 50 factors analyzed, the number one on the first place was the number +1 on Google+.  Next on the list are: the number of Facebook fans, the number and quality of backlinks (note, only the third place), the number of friends, likes, comments on Facebook, activity on Pinterest and Twitter, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fec/278/581/fec278581ee2f9fa0731dcdbaf38d187.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Another interesting experiment conducted by experts Tasty Placement.  The company has created 6 sites in one niche.  After performing the necessary on-page-events, the resources began to unwind, using only one social network for each.  After a while, Tasty Placement looked at how this strategy affected the results of the issue.  The site with 100 followers on Google+ has risen by almost 14 positions.  300 +1 helped another resource climb approximately 9 positions.  Promotion through Facebook allowed us to earn about 7 positions.  Twitter was the least effective.

      <u><i>But for high positions in the SERP, it is not enough just to have pages on social networks.</i></u> <br><br>  It is also important: <br><br>  A. Actively develop your pages, regularly add new posts there, increase the number of friends and followers. <br>  B. Strive for the maximum amount of Shera, Likes, comments, reviews. <br>  C. Analyze and analyze again: what people like, what they like and fumble the most actively. <br>  D. To make the whole interactive website accessible to the user and comfortable for him. <br><br>  What tools can help with the tasks listed above?  It is clear that, first of all, these are all kinds of social modules of buttons, comments, polls, and other interactivity on websites.  The most popular in the West is <a href="http://www.addthis.com/">AddThis</a> service, which is also popular in runet.  From the freshest thing that emerged here, in the domestic segment, the <a href="http://uptolike.ru/">UpToLike</a> system.  It differs as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Customization:</b> you can select likes / shera // buttons for following different shapes, sizes, styles, colors, as well as several options for their location on the site.  This is where the visual experiment is described - how the buttons can work depending on the location on the starcher. </li><li>  <b>Many social networks.</b>  The Yandex panel supports just over 10 social networks.  UpToLike works with 29. </li><li>  <b>Functionality.</b>  Buttons can be used for cheers, likes and folloving.  The follow-up function is a fairly new thing for such services, it works great for replenishing groups and social networking pages with new members who come themselves without additional involvement. </li><li>  <b>There is a module of polls.</b>  This is one of the latest updates in UpToLike.  In the near future, the module will be added comments and contests. </li><li>  <b>Statistics:</b> who fumbled, who liked what, who returned from those who shared and so on.  Simple, visual graphs for analysis, you can repackage the content, you can find out what readers like most, what types of materials, what titles, what pictures, etc. </li></ul><br><br>  Unfortunately, there is not a single comprehensive study that would show exactly how the shape, color and location of the buttons affect the number of clicks.  However, some experts during the experiments revealed the most effective formula for themselves and actively use it. <br><br>  For example, Neil Patel, the founder of a number of projects, named by Barack Obama as one of the top 100 entrepreneurs under the age of 30, on his website <a href="http://www.quicksprout.com/2012/10/25/7-social-media-mistakes-that-can-keep-your-content-from-going-viral/">Quicksprout</a> conducted several experiments to prove that the layout of social buttons affects the number of sherov and likes, and find out what same location is optimal.  First, he compared the number of clicks on social buttons located below and above the post.  Buttons on the top got 117% more clicks.  Next, Nil correlated social buttons on top of a post with a dynamic panel located on the right or left.  The panel received 226% more clicks.  Then Neil tested the combinations: dynamic panel + buttons from below and dynamic panel + buttons from above.  The first option received 29% more clicks.  Conclusion: the combination of a dynamic panel and buttons below is the most effective.  At least for the Quicksprout project. <br><br><ul><li>  Also, a number of experts in the American forums shared their thoughts and findings about the optimal button size. </li><li>  If we are talking about conservative media and commercial sites (newspapers, financial sites, real estate companies), then it is recommended to use standard or slightly smaller buttons.  The audience of such resources, even if socially active, is rather conservative. </li><li>  In blogs and information portals it is considered that the larger the button is, the more visible it is and the more likely it is to click on it.  Of course, there should be a sense of proportion, but experimenting is not only possible, but necessary. </li><li>  As for online stores or websites where users are called to a specific action (download, subscribe, etc.), the social button should be secondary to the main action button, but not be lost on the page.  What and can be achieved with the help of customization. </li></ul><br><br>  We make a reservation here that there is no universal recipe for effective buttons.  Everything is individual, and what works for a neighbor will not necessarily work for you.  You yourself will have to identify the formula that will be optimal.  Fortunately, there are suitable tools for this, including the services mentioned above. <br><br>  As for the connection with SEO, social signals will undoubtedly give their profit.  By the way, SEO specialists were the first to notice such links, starting with Google+.  It is clear that in this plane, as always and in everything related to SEO, there are no 100% immutable truths, but there are excellent opportunities for experimentation.  Someone is already experimenting, someone will come to this later, but sooner or later this connection will be exploited en masse, there are all prerequisites for that.  If you want to ‚Äúgrab‚Äù more than the rest - you should probably start.  A simple installation of a new button code ( <a href="http://uptolike.ru/">UpToLike</a> or something else) - and it started: experiments, experiments, and once again experiments, as well as analysis, analysis, analysis. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/205338/">https://habr.com/ru/post/205338/</a></p>
