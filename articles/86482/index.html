During this time I discovered both pros and cons.  Before HTC HERO, I had only Nokia on Symbian OS.  The last nokia was the e71, which I still consider the most successful smart device of all time and I can not but compare some aspects of the Hero with the e71, please treat with understanding!  :) <br>  I also understand that the post of the following content may not be very warmly received by habrayusers, since Android is loved here.  Moreover, this is my first post!  I also love Android, but there is no perfect OS! <br><br>  In this post, I will present thoughts about the most urgent problems of the Android operating system, since there was a lot written about the advantages, and it is not fair to describe the product from only one (good) side to those who have not yet made their choice. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Immediately, I note: HTC Hero as a device is not to blame for almost anything.  It is made beautiful.  Everything that I am writing below concerns exactly Android 1.5, 2.1 on Hero is still not there, maybe something new in the new version.  The sequence of points is not built on importance, but as far as remembered!  :) <br><br>  I'll start.  The first thing that everyone already knows about is that the inability to fully use bluetooth will not be able to either receive or transmit anything.  The most annoying thing is that I laughed so much from this problem in the iphone, and now I ran into it myself!  To the problematic sinzubu, I'll also take a not very good job with the headset.  On Nokia, if I plugged in the headset, all sounds (system, music, games) went into my ear, then just when I called, I played some kind of incomprehensible ringtone (sewn into the headset) only with an incoming call, everything else plays through the speaker.  In addition, if you answer the call with a button on the device, the sound enters the earphone after 5 seconds, before that, it‚Äôs worth talking through the telephone speaker.  The headset turns off very often.  Perhaps the problem is in the headset, but on Nokia all the headsets worked perfectly!

      It‚Äôs very inconvenient that you cannot simply and easily, like on Nokia, choose a ringtone, SMS, alarm clock.  Initially, you can only choose from pre-installed (very much such-to-yourself) melodies, even if the card is packed with other mp3s.  To select a melody that is not from the list of standard ones on the memory card, you need to create special folders where to throw the necessary mp3.  This is not just uncomfortable, but ultra uncomfortable! <br><br>  Alarm clock problem  It's all bad, despite the flawless implementation.  The fact is that it is necessary to check the alarm volume every time, it has the ability to turn the volume down to ‚Äú0 ‚Ä≥ without any warnings.  The probability of oversleeping is 50/50.  And the saddest thing is that it is impossible to check the volume of the alarm with standard tools, you need to install third-party software to control the volume.  For statistics, the alarm sound is cut down about once every 4 days.  Be careful! <br><br>  The problem of loudness in android concerns not only the alarm clock, here it is one continuous problem.  To begin with, the volume settings here are many, very.  Here you can find sms, alarm clock, call and multimedia, and a whole lot more ... But there are volume settings for different functions in different places (quest 1 - find them!), For an orderly arrangement of volume sliders you need to install third-party software (quest 2 - find it)!  Another bad thing is that the volume setting is constantly hanging on the volume rocker.  In your pocket, you can turn down the volume completely randomly.  And if now you are listening to music or playing a game with music, the volume rocker is responsible for multimedia.  In fact, it is very uncomfortable.  I want to set up once at a certain volume setting point for everything as it is convenient for me and forget about it.  Again, as in Nokia ... <br><br>  By the way, the switch to silent mode is not here.  Third-party software is needed ... More precisely, this function is implemented, but how!  Here's how: to switch to silent mode, press the volume rocker downward until the device is muted, hold down the end button and select the silent mode in the menu that appears or go to: settings -&gt; sound and screen -&gt; go to silent mode.  To go back to the sonic mode, you must do one of the options again or install third-party software. <br><br>  Very saddened by the implementation of the copy / paste text.  The most convenient test to copy and paste on Blackberry, there in any window where there is text, the cursor flashes.  Treyk bolom bring him to the right place, pinch shift and copy.  On Symbian, copy-paste is also implemented perfectly.  On Android, it‚Äôs simply not useful.  In order to copy the text, it is necessary in the input field (exactly in the input field) with a long tap to select the item "select text", then try to get to where you are going to start copying and drag to the planned end.  Everything should be on the same screen.  Everything needs to be done without releasing the finger from the screen (and under the finger you can not see anything).  If you release your finger, you will have to repeat everything again, since the text will be copied immediately.  For a note, I have never, in 2 months of using a hero, copied the text normally.  It is long, uncomfortable and painful. <br><br>  The telephone part is made for the top three.  Mainly due to call log.  I am very accustomed (it‚Äôs not just a habit, it‚Äôs so convenient) to open a magazine and see dialed calls in front of dialed contacts.  In android to view the time of the call, you will have to make an additional 2 tapes on small icons.  Another magazine slows down.  Example: I have unlimited and I often get a call for me to recapture and redial.  But here the problem is, the broken contact is indexed in the log only after 3 seconds, if you don‚Äôt wait - type another contact.  For work is not suitable. <br><br>  One SMS can only be sent to one addressee ... Stupid.  Again, there is third-party software. <br><br>  Search.  Generally executed incomprehensible.  In some places (sms, mail) you can search only with a capital letter (by default, input is made with a small one in the contact search fields), or by a certain criterion (or name, or surname), but by what - android decides, it is impossible to guess here. <br><br>  Sometimes SMS messages come to you that someone called when you were out of coverage.  On Nokia, I just pointed the cursor to the number and clicked to call.  Here you will need to make 5 extra tapes ... <br><br>  Work with e-mail done not bad, but with attachments terribly.  You can only send a picture, sound, document ... You do not choose a standard file for Android.  You can add files to the letter only one by one ... <br><br>  If you have not made yourself full access to the system (root-rights), some functions of third-party applications will not work.  For me, such an application turned out to be a program for turning the device into a wifi access point. <br><br>  I do not know why there is still no normal video player for Android, like CorePlayer.  The video does not pull, only very converted. <br><br>  I do not know if this is a problem of a hero or an android, but the device does not support simultaneous operation of GPRS / EDGE and a telephone conversation.  When you call, the Internet breaks.  There are some problems with downloading files. <br><br>  And finally - two small problems of the hero himself: a weak battery (soot it for 3-4 hours) and the location of memory cards under the battery cover. <br><br>  To be completely honest, if I had known about all these problems before, I would have remained faithful with the Nokia e71.  Android today is a very promising axis, but not yet as streamlined and high-quality as some competing, albeit smoothly dying.  Android can now be compared to Chinese cars: with very high potential and very fast gaining momentum.  After a year or two, the android will become the leading OS, just as the Chinese auto industry will start making really serious cars in 5 years. <br><br>  UPD.  I forgot to mention a few more minuses of Andrew.  Install applications only in the device memory.  It is, as it were, not a little, 512 MB, but less than 200 are available for use. This is not enough, I constantly face the problem of lack of memory.  And one more drawback - the inability to take a screenshot on a device without ROOT rights.  In general, ROOT rights solve many problems, but this is a piece of work.  Especially with the Ukrainian firmware number 425. <br><br>  UPD 2. Still sold the hero and bought himself a Nokia e72.  Maybe for someone it's a downgrade, but for me it's a breath of fresh air. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86482/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86482/</a></p>
