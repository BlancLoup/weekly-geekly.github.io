  <section class="page js-page"><h1>iOS Digest number 7 (May 31 - June 13)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/au/as/tf/auastfl_fu2ifbrtu4-ti5nsm6o.jpeg"><br>  <sup>Image source: <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/">businessinsider.com</a></sup> <br>  Astrologers have announced a week of news and announcements in the world of Apple and iOS development.  To tell about everything, one article is not enough, so let's look at the most interesting and those that have not yet received due attention. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Industry news </h3><br><ul><li>  Publishing Business Insider <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-glasses-hints-from-wwdc-2019-2019-6">suggests</a> that Apple, with its announcements at WWDC, has laid the foundation for smart glasses, which it plans to release next year.  This can be judged on the basis of several updates. <br><br>  First, for the third year in a row, demos with virtual and augmented reality are shown at the conference, and this year three new tools were announced for AR (ARKit 3, RealityKit and Reality Composer).  Moreover, this time the stake was made on interaction with people: this is the technology of motion capture, and the possibility of more realistic display of people around virtual objects. <br><br>  Secondly, there are improvements in Apple maps - in the new version there will be functionality similar to Google's Street View, which is likely to be more convenient on smart glasses.  It is assumed that the glasses will work on the basis of a new operating system with the code name "rOS" or "reality operating system".  For a long time something was not new devices, it would be interesting to see how these glasses will differ from those already existing on the market. <br></li><li>  Two weeks ago, Apple <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/05/31/apple-iphone-cellular-limit-increased/">increased the</a> maximum limit for downloading apps via cellular.  Previously, the threshold value was 150 MB, now everything is 200. And after a few days, it turned out that in iOS 13, users <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/06/07/download-any-size-app-iphone-cellular/">will be able</a> to disable the limit altogether.  You no longer have to distribute Wi-Fi from another iPhone to iphone to outwit the system! <br></li><li>  <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650683/apple-tv-xbox-one-ps4-controller-support-wwdc-2019">The Verge</a> reports that iOS 13 and Apple TV will support game controllers from Xbox One and PS4.  This announcement is primarily associated with the recent creation of a gaming service with custom <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-arcade/">Arcade</a> subscriptions. <br></li><li>  If you are not <a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/wwdc-2019-viewing-guide/">sure</a> where to start watching WWDC sessions, then several <a href="https://useyourloaf.com/blog/wwdc-2019-viewing-guide/">guides</a> and <a href="https://habr.com/ru/company/e-Legion/blog/454894/">lists</a> have already appeared, you can take them to help. <br></li><li>  Apple tightens certificate management rules for signing enterprise applications.  In accordance with the new agreements, such applications may be subject to individual checks, and Apple reserves the right to approve or reject them.  Previously, there was a scandal when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/31/18205795/apple-google-blocked-internal-ios-apps-developer-certificate">violations</a> surfaced: it turned out that Facebook and Google used such certificates for applications that collect user data.  Then the Facebook certificate was temporarily revoked, which prevented the company from updating any of the internal applications.  Perhaps a scandal and tightened the rules. <br></li><li>  An updated version of the iCloud application for Windows has been released, it is already available in the Microsoft Store.  And while working on it, Apple collaborated with Microsoft, and the news appeared in the <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2019/06/11/apples-all-new-icloud-for-windows-app-now-available-in-the-microsoft-store/">official Microsoft Windows blog</a> .  Commentators have already appeared on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D20158309">Hacker News</a> forum planning to unsubscribe from Dropbox.  It remains to wait for the official support for iCloud-services on Linux. <br></li></ul><br><h3>  IOS development news </h3><br><ul><li>  If you have already played enough with SwiftUI, then you can practice and try to port your iPad application on a Mac using Catalyst technology.  More details in the <a href="https://www.highcaffeinecontent.com/blog/20190607-Beyond-the-Checkbox-with-Catalyst-and-AppKit">Beyond the Checkbox with Catalyst and AppKit</a> article.  Apple themselves have already (at least a little) used this technology to give an example to the developers. <br></li><li>  Users of the new beta version of Xcode noticed that when creating a new application with SwiftUI, Xcode does not create the Main.storyboard file.  There are quite a few known difficulties in using storyboards: the lack of readability on code review and, as a result, the inability to edit source codes and collaborative editing by several developers.  Attempts have already been made to improve their use: the last time they added the ability to break a massive storyboard and make references to others, but will there be a continuation or will Apple refuse to use them?

    <blockquote>  At our last <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3D455980">Mobius</a> conference, a contest was organized at the VK stand on speed setting up, where iOS developers won in the overall standings - despite the fact that nobody knew about SwiftUI then.  On the next Mobius, it would be interesting to repeat the activity: will the results change if the iOS nicknames use SwiftUI to quickly prototype the interfaces? <br></blockquote></li><li>  In the new version of iOS, work in the background is subject to change.  A new framework was announced with the uncomplicated name <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/backgroundtasks">BackgroundTasks</a> , which allows you to run application tasks that may take a minute to complete.  This functionality will appeal to developers, but it is unlikely to all users - the life of the battery and the entire device will affect it for the worse.  It is possible that the device will be ready to perform such tasks only when it is connected to the charger and with the power saving mode turned off. <br></li><li>  If you use Machine Learning on an iPhone or are just going, then the <a href="https://machinethink.net/blog/new-in-coreml3/">An in-depth</a> article <a href="https://machinethink.net/blog/new-in-coreml3/">look at Core ML 3 is</a> for you, it describes in detail the changes from the previous version. <br></li><li>  Finally, we are looking at <a href="https://medium.com/%40rwbutler/animated-gradients-on-ios-aa117551e533">how to add animated gradients</a> to your iOS application.  The tutorial is pretty detailed, but the main thing with gradients is not to overdo it, otherwise users will run away. <br></li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/455980/">https://habr.com/ru/post/455980/</a></p>
