  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Amazing hosting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently I bought another hosting service in Golden Telecom, a company known to us. <a name="habracut"></a><br>  They have great advertising: <br>  GT&gt; Hosting service allows you to host a full-fledged interactive site <br>  GT&gt; on our servers, use the services of the mail server, <br>  GT&gt; organize a website of any complexity.  24/7 guaranteed <br>  GT&gt; high availability of your website from the Internet <br>  GT&gt; performance and the presence of a large number of additional <br>  GT&gt; services. <br>  Tariff plan: <br>  GT&gt; "Master" - all included!  Domain in the zone ru (com, net, org) and a wide GT&gt; range of additional services and services. <br>  But when the process was already irreversible, I encountered several unpleasant moments. <br>  The money was honestly paid before the new year, according to the assurances of the responsible person, ‚ÄúHosting will be opened immediately after the receipt of funds on our personal account.‚Äù  OK, I thought) <br>  If you believe the payment order, the funds arrived in the last days of December.  And so, I am pleased to start preparing for the new year ... The new year was a success, I safely forgot about acquiring until the 9th. <br>  10 suddenly remembered and decided to check the mail on which access details should have been received.  But it was empty there: (My questions from nic.ru about my domain name, nic answered me with an offer to purchase it) <br>  Calls to the hosting department did not end with anything ... endless long beeps.  just trouble) And literally on Tuesday after my letter to GT, I received the answer "-Today the hosting will be open."  Well, finally I thought), and in vain ... No, I do not want to say that the hosting was not opened to me. <br>  To celebrate, I went in and uploaded the content from the test server.  And I just rushed to change access rights as I ran into another problem. The right to execute scripts is not set :) Fantastic!  550 Primishn Dinayd. <br>  I was also answered by another resource on the same hosting. I called them all day, wrote a letter ... <br>  By evening I phoned and began to ask for help in my ridiculous situation.  The answer was simple: "-We are in the know about the problem and are already solving it" <br>  How long should I wait?  I asked, "We'll try to sort it out next week." <br><br>  Well, okay ... Incredible delight caused me a letter, after which I can not write this topic.  I quote: <br>  - Installed either via FAR - Ctrl-A (xxx x_x x_x), or terminal - the command chmod 755 &lt;file name&gt;. <br>  Chmod supports group file operations. <br>  - And after that they say that they are aware of the problems and are already actively solving them)) <br><br>  as one of my friends says: These are the chela's pies !! 11 (c) <br>  Who faced already similar?  I don‚Äôt want to believe that I‚Äôm so lucky alone :) </div>
