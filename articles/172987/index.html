And, therefore, I decided to share my thoughts on this issue. <br><br><h4>  Megabyte payment, it's the same - the last century! </h4>  The fact is that for a long time operators have been offering solutions that provide fast and inexpensive mobile Internet, and, for modern 4G networks, producing not per megabyte, but more importantly for modern conditions, per-megabyte tariffication of traffic at intervals, tariffs of 2 Gigabytes, without subscription fees, with the ability to use high-speed Internet, while spending a total of 10 rubles per month, and then, and that cooler - the ability to completely free use of the Internet. <br><br><h4>  Formulation of the problem: </h4>  To me, as an advanced GSM cellular user, <br>  I would like to have an affordable mobile GPRS / EDGE / 3G / 4G Internet: <br>  - no speed limit regardless of the amount of traffic; <br>  - without the obligatory monthly subscription fee for communication services; <br>  - with charging by the total volume of consumed traffic; <br>  - with the cost of 1 Gigabyte of traffic not more than 10 rubles; <br>  - With a daily period of write-off of funds in accordance with the calculation; <br>  - with non-tariffable traffic volume up to 50 megabytes per day; <br>  - with guaranteed protection from "accidental" care, in-minus due to overspending; <br>  - with the possibility of linear scaling speed upwards.

    <h4>  Seems incredible? </h4>  Nevertheless, for subscribers of the Central region of the Russian Federation such a task is completely solvable! <br>  In this topic, I will try to dispel doubts on this subject, and propose to solve a simple task related to the savings on the cost of paying for the Internet. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt understand how it is possible for one operator to have such a spread in tariffs for the same 3G Internet with a difference of three orders!  (however, I also don‚Äôt understand how in this situation you can take more than 1 kopeck per SMS message). <br><br><h4>  Disclaimer: </h4>  In this topic there will be a bunch of blatant advertising of two well-known opsoks, therefore, <a name="habracut"></a>  even if, suddenly, for someone this topic will be useless, I ask to be a little more indulgent to me, because to someone, nevertheless, my topic will be of great service and will help to reduce the expenses on the Internet at least a little.  At least, I hope that someone, thanks to my article, will change ideas about the real cost of the Internet without a monthly fee. <br><br><h4>  Mobile Internet lifecycle </h4>  Historically, I always went online via a cell phone, connecting it as a modem to my computer. <br>  There were times when cellular operators for providing access to the Internet demanded besides, actually, paying for traffic (with corresponding rounding), also a monthly fee, and also the connection / disconnection of GPRS services was paid. <br>  Nevertheless, the ability to be connected to the Network for 20 hours gave an indisputable benefit compared to dial-up access. <br>  Oh, what were the times ... <br>  The question of saving money was then most acute. <br>  I had to use the shutdown of scripts, graphics, traffic compression, and even artificially lower the speed of the modem (I usually set 9600 bps). <br>  At the same time, I constantly had to monitor the traffic counter (sent / received) out of the corner of my eye and, sometimes, even when I clicked on the link, when a large file suddenly started to load, I had to pull out the USB cord from the phone (just to prevent the traffic). <br><br><h4>  Freebie, sir! </h4><blockquote>  - Dad, eh, free mobile Internet happens? <br>  - No, son.  It's fantastic! </blockquote><h4>  How much is completely free Internet? </h4>  So, for example, we have 1000 rubles. <br><h4>  Task: </h4>  get a free Internet, well, and preferably, a little more quickly, and that was enough longer (and at the same time manage to keep the entire amount safe and sound, without spending their money on communication services). <br><br><h5>  Advertising: </h5><h6>  MegaFON enables all its subscribers to use mobile Internet free of charge ** <br>  (Information is valid for the Central region until January 31, 2014 <br>  If, of course, MegaFON suddenly, does not change its mind and does not cancel this freebie) <br>  Details on the toll-free number <s>0330</s> </h6>  (Please do not call this number if you are not in the Vladimir region, according to information from a comment to my topic, for this you can withdraw money in the amount of 30 rubles, although I myself called back again - everything works - they tell about the service and its connection rules. Here is the old <a href="http://vl.megafon.ru/bonus/action/arhiv_act/20120604-1706.html">link</a> and the new <a href="http://vl.megafon.ru/bonus/action/xs_v_podarok.html">link</a> on the official site). <br>  That is, having contributed up to 1,100 rubles to your own balance in the MegaFON network, it is possible to use the mobile Internet for up to 320 days. <br>  In this situation, it is possible to completely receive 16 GB of mobile traffic for free with no speed limit (as well as for especially greedy subscribers, at least, as much, but already at a speed close to zero). <br>  ** (By the way, for some subscribers, receiving one month of Freebies will not require any deposits at all, and will be reduced only to sending a single free USSD request to the number <b>* 0330 #</b> , and, all subsequent contributions will be sent only for extending freebies for another month) <br>  In this case, the entire amount paid will not be spent at all, and can be spent by the subscriber on any other purposes. <br><br><h5>  Advertising: </h5><h6>  MegaFON makes it possible to pay for purchases in online stores at the expense of funds in a personal account for any amount within the balance balance * <br>  (the service is available to subscribers of individuals with an advance payment system) <br>  Commission is 1.5% of the payment amount. <br>  Service connection via USSD * 455 * 1 # (free of charge). </h6><br>  In Beeline, however, by depositing the same 1000 rubles to your balance, you can get only 60 days of free Internet, but only 4 Gigabytes will be at high speed (at the same time, slowly pump as much again, will not work, and spend 1000 rubles for something other than communication services will be a bit more problematic). <br><br><h5>  Advertising: </h5><h6>  As part of the ‚ÄúFree Internet Month‚Äù Promotion, after making the first payment in the amount of at least 400 rubles to your account, Beeline allows you to use the Internet without a monthly fee for 30 days * <br>  (The terms of the Promotion apply to subscribers of the ‚ÄúInternet for Tablet‚Äù Tariff Plan and Options ‚ÄúUnlimited for Tablet‚Äù). </h6><br><h4>  Potsony, ATAS! </h4>  But what to do if you need not free Internet, but, paid, but very cheap, and so that the speed does not depend on the volume? <br><br><h5>  Advertising: </h5><h6>  BeeLine has the cheapest mobile 3G Internet in the world with no speed limit * <br>  (the information is valid for the Central region at least until March 25, 2013, provided that Beeline employees do not read Habr, and will not cover this freebie after reading my topic) </h6><br>  That is, in Beeline, with skillful use of the Unlimited Tablet Options, it is possible to pump 60 gigabytes of high-speed mobile traffic monthly for 300 rubles a month. <br><h6>  Connection option: <br>  0674508881 <br>  Disable: <br>  0674508880 </h6><br>  Last year and the year before, <b>150 rubles per month</b> on the ‚Äú <b>Easy</b> ‚Äù tariff plan with the ‚Äú <b>Carefree Internet</b> ‚Äù option <b>enabled</b> could be pumped through <b>30 gigabytes each</b> month at high speeds, but last fall they covered this freebie, however, leaving the possibility use the Internet at the same rates, in terms of Gigabyte (but already with the imposition of twice the amount of consumption of high-speed traffic, that is, with daily use of the Internet, monthly expenses will increase from 150 to 300 rubles, thereby approaching the usual  th "unlimited" at a cost). <br><br>  So, summarizing the above information, you can get this tasty solution: <br><br>  <b>From March 16, 2013 to May 7, 2014</b> <b><br></b>  <b>Get 850 gigabytes of traffic for 4200 rubles.</b> <br><br>  To do this, from March 16, 2013 to April 15 to invest 3300 rubles <br>  And further, from May 15 to December 31, invest the remaining 900 rubles. <br><br><h4>  In other words, we end up with: </h4>  418 days for more than 2 Gigabytes of high-speed traffic daily with a write-off of just 10 rubles per day (in the case of using the Internet), and without debiting any money from the account, if there was not a single Internet connection in a day (or day did not exceed 50 megabytes, when you access the Internet until January 31, 2014). <br><br>  In this case, the average cost of 1 gigabyte will cost only 5 rubles (and this despite the fact that there is no monthly subscription fee). <br><br>  By the way, for this case a two-sim telephone A350 with 3G support for 3000 rubles is ideal. <br><br><h4>  So, how is it possible? </h4>  How specifically to "turn" such an operation, with all the details, I will definitely write in the sequel to this article. <br>  And, now, I suggest the respected Habrayusers to think independently about solving this task. <br><br>  Unfortunately, with regard to the <b>MTS,</b> I cannot suggest the most convenient solution, since the study of their tariffs plunged me into complete dismay.  If, however, someone prompts a similar solution using proposals from MTS, then I will be happy to add other proposals to the article to ensure objectivity of the presentation. <br><br>  If I really helped someone with my advice, then I would like to receive feedback, for example, I can be thanked by replenishing the balance of my mobile phone <br><h4>  8-930-835-90-33 </h4>  for any amount at its discretion. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/172987/">https://habr.com/ru/post/172987/</a></p>
