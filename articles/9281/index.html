Diablo from the first and, a little, the third person in the demonic interiors of London and its underground from the creators of the original Diablo - here is a brief history of the future role-playing hit.  Later summer or early autumn will definitely put the final points on the ‚Äúe‚Äù (H√∂llgate?), And as long as we just collect a welcome wreath of information, weaving in there a couple of sensational news feeds ... <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/eb7/a7b/1a1/eb7a7b1a152d6ddbecf64b0fd1e8df98.jpg" width="250" height="193" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Three brave</b> <br>  Hellgate: London - the debut project of Flagship Studios.  At this point, one could begin to get nervous and exude skepticism if Bill Roper, one of the fathers of the original Diablo, were not at the head of the office.  It is with Diablo that Hellgate is constantly being compared, although the assessment of the upcoming game from the screenshots does not push this to anything.  On the contrary: in the pictures we see a classic first-person shooter, where our hero in urban scenery is fighting against some fiend. <br>  In fact, the shell in Hellgate is more deceptive than anywhere else.  Before us is the role-playing game in the style of Diablo.  At least two thirds.  As we know at the moment, the heroes of three classes will fight against the demonic hordes landing on Earth.  The first is the Templars.  These are harsh guys in high-tech armor, with the same ease owning gas benches, pump guns and God's grace (in the form of healing and protective auras).  The path of the Templar is not easy, but not difficult. <br>  The second in the battle with the ghouls, who settled in the British capital (no, we are not talking about Berezovsky!), Enters the Kabbalist.  The hero of this class is capable of all sorts of magical things, such as turning demons into other demons, turning themselves into demons or temporal invisibility. <br>  Finally, the third type of freedom fighter in London is the Hunter.  It is thanks to him, probably, completely uncompromising fans of shooters will be able to play Hellgate, who are not able to endure role-playing games.  The fact is that for the sake of the Hunter, the developers have changed the rules of the game - having gone hunting, this hero can count not only on the indicators of his skills, but also on trivial dexterity and accuracy.  Playing for the Hunter, the gamer will see how much Hellgate is capable of mimicking an action movie with sabotage elements. <br><br>  <b>Big Bang Fall</b> <br>  The appearance of demons in the British capital is explained by developers with incredible grace and wit.  Exactly five years from today, a portal from Hell will open over London (and even, perhaps, over Big Ben!) From Hell, from where demons will emerge in orderly sounds, to the sounds of fascist marches and tomtoms of cannibal tribes.  After a brief fight with people, uninvited guests will turn into the owners of the Earth, and the remnants of the human race will have to exist in dungeons, catacombs (thanks to the Romans for their construction to the glory of the English people!) And the subway. <br>  Fortunately, among the people there are brave men who are not afraid to put together an order of resistance to the hellish yoke.  Of course, the gamer is automatically assigned to the battle group of these new Crusaders - with all the responsibilities that this entails. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/332/465/0ec/3324650ecbf37193dcdb5f60b54967b0.jpg" width="450" height="252" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  So, in the yard - the year 2032.  The waters of the Thames have dried up; in the Shattered Tower there are "beasts" - mutant creatures created by demons to protect their hellish law and order.  The demons themselves are the top of the hierarchical alien pyramid and rarely appear on the streets of London.  Unless, if some detachment from the Templars, Hunters and Kabbalists really gets closer to its main goal - to close the portal between the Earth and the Underworld.  On other days, the new owners of the planet are idly blissful, preferring that the same "beasts", the energy beings - the Ghosts and the revived dead, are dealt with the unwanted.  The blessing after each skirmish of the last becomes more and more.

      <b>Play, play and play ...</b> <br>  The main concern of Flagship Studios, after the ambitious task of turning the shooter into Diablo, is the implementation of the cunning plan to increase the playability of Hellgate.  Ideally, to infinity.  This difficult task has a dual solution: on the one hand - for the solo mode, on the other - for the multiplayer. <br>  With multiplayer, everything is simple.  For the most part, it will be designed for cooperative cooperation of players against monsters, although the elements of dueling practice and the beginnings of mass wall-to-wall massacre will be left for particularly violent ones.  Most likely, the developers will not deny themselves the pleasure to tickle some players nerves, introducing into play a game mode, similar to Hardcore from Diablo 2 (the death of the hero permanently blocks the player‚Äôs account).  And, of course, the developers will not give up the system of two corridors: for ordinary citizens and those who are not greedy to spend on the account ten bucks a month.  The money guys will be rewarded with numerous bonuses, quite simplifying life among Angloman demons.  Namely: round-the-clock technical support on the Web and telephone, 12 characters in one hand (only 3 will be given free of charge), 40 items in "chests" (twice as many as "common people"), access to game servers out of turn, if any will arise, the right to transfer characters from one server to another, unique weapons, armor and other items that can be sent to other "elite" users by local mail, the right to board the train, delivering the player to remote corners of London, the opportunity to become an officer in the guild as well  the right to buy, own, and enter own guild buildings or premises (simple players may be guilds, but real estate transactions are not available and, moreover, they cannot enter buildings), additional game modes that are inaccessible to the common people, fresh portions of the new content - monsters, objects, game modes ... In general, there is something to think about.  At least on how to find 10 dollars a month. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/877/84e/d0d/87784ed0db111395b59504c5c3218355.jpg" width="450" height="281" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  The joy of solo passing at Flagship Studios decided to stretch using a random number generator.  Tested on Diablo focus developed in Hellgate, it seems to the limit. <br>  Of course, the novelty will randomly generate levels: the city, the catacombs, the underground will be London only in name.  The variety of properties of one hundred types of planned weapons (cold and firearms) will be brought to an insane number of googlion by the same randomizer.  Finally, the randomizer will settle in the hut buildings, a visit to which will improve the character's randomly-taken characterization, his skill or ability.  Thanks to such a heap of pseudochaos, each passage, although it will have a common outline, will become a unique and unique thing. <br><br>  <b>The laptop will pull!</b> <br>  Not so much is known about the technological basis of Hellgate.  It is clear that the game will have a sufficiently powerful role-playing system of parameters, skills and abilities, the choice of which for a gamer will be virtually unlimited.  Model characters and demons will be fully interactive.  The structure of the model will be divided into sections (foot / elbow / shoulder / hip / torso).  Each section has its own collection of items.  When a gamer ‚Äúputs on‚Äù a new item, the game replaces one section with another, checking with its database.  The color component of the object will denote its properties and quality. <br>  The system requirements of Hellgate today seem pretty reasonable.  According to Bill Rouper, the test version goes very well on a Dell 2.0GHz laptop, 2GB RAM, GeForce 7800 Go at a resolution of 1680x1050 with maximum settings. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/9281/">https://habr.com/ru/post/9281/</a></p>
