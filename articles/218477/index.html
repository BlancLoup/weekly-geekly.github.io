But few, for one reason or another, have more than one set-top box.  What to do if you want to watch your favorite channel, if the TV is busy firmly and for a long time?  The answer is in this article. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/874/bc5/807/874bc580788bf3772dd0505dcd348bd7.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  When moving to a new place of residence, first of all, I connected the Internet package and interactive television from Rostelecom. <br>  Rostelecom employees installed their favorite Sagemcom F @ st2804 router and Motorola VIP1003 set-top box. <br>  The connection diagram was originally as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e79/da2/7db/e79da27db1f0415c546baa75f54e5bb7.png">

      On the router, the first of the four available LAN ports was configured as a WAN, the second was set up by a bridge (let's say, the pass-through channel between the first and second ports), and on the third and fourth ports the Internet was heard.  The first port was connected cable from the provider, the second - a TV set-top box, and the third and fourth ports were occupied by two desktop computers. <br><br>  This solution had one very serious drawback: if the router was hanging, then television was also cut short.  It was necessary to restart the router and wait about a minute before establishing the connection. <br><br>  After another hang of the router as an experiment, the set-top box was connected to the network via a switch, bypassing the router: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3d8/3f8/d1c/3d83f8d1c4d54bae84720d868289cc7f.png"><br><br>  Needless to say that television has worked well? <br><br>  One evening I turned on the National Geographic channel, and there, the Megazavody program began.  I wanted to watch this program, but I was kicked out, because my grandmother and grandfather watched another ‚ÄúCop‚Äù series on NTV. <br>  There is only one prefix in the house, but I really want to see an interesting channel.  What to do?  The decision came immediately: ‚ÄúAnd what if you try to set up digital television on a laptop?‚Äù <br><br>  Unfortunately, the TP-Link WR842ND router, which was bought instead of the Rostelecom router that was handed back, turned out to be the first revision and IGMP does not support it.  I was upset, but I found the program <a href="http://borpas.info/iptvplayer">IP-TV Player</a> and the <a href="http://dtvp.ru/">DISEL-TV Player</a> assembly optimized for the North Caucasian Rostelecom based on the original IP-TV Player version. <br><br>  DISEL-TV Player has ready-made playlists adapted to the local Rostelecom.  The format of playlists is m3u. <br><br>  I downloaded and installed DISEL-TV Player.  By analogy with the console, I connected a laptop to one of the free ports of the switch. <br>  The network card via DHCP received the following settings: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3df/7bf/b5a/3df7bfb5a331ed9adea0fee4d1714445.png"><br><br>  As you can see, unlike PPPoE, the subnet mask is completely different.  That is why IGMP router support is needed, the router's ports are configured by a bridge or enabled via a switch. <br><br>  I chose the desired network in the player settings ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8a0/62b/907/8a062b907febeb01d31bbab13b75f485.png"><br><br>  And IP-TV earned: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/94e/851/361/94e85136149d4d3b79328806874eaf52.jpg"><br><br>  Science 2.0 <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9dd/254/149/9dd2541490cafe9bae13c6a59dfcc411.jpg"><br><br>  I was very surprised when even ‚ÄúPlayboy‚Äù turned on, although the 18+ channel package is not connected to me. <br><br>  Even login with a password did not need to drive. <br>  Voice-over: interesting, login and password is needed only for the "interactive" features of the console? <br><br>  And here I am again faced with a nuisance: having two parallel connections, the computer becomes confused where its internet is and stops opening pages. <br><br>  At random, I determined that television is really far and deep, which IP address is in the network settings.  You can specify for example 192.168.137.1/255.255.255.0.  The local network will no longer be defined as a home network, and internet connection will again become available. <br><br>  Do not forget to select the network in the player settings again. <br><br>  If the laptop has no shortage of network devices, then you will need a second network card to watch television on your desktop computer. <br><br>  The final connection scheme is as follows: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/151/400/899/1514008995ace2526999870823a0a842.png"><br><br>  Red indicates the wires needed to watch television on a laptop and desktop computer. <br><br>  And another fly in the ointment (regarding Stavropol Rostelecom): If you turn on the same channel on the computer and on the console, and then close the player or switch to another channel, the television on the console will hang until the same channel is resumed or hangs off in a minute just me. <br><br>  Recently, I began to pick the topic further. <br>  Found the program <a href="http://www.progdvb.com/rus/">ProgDVB</a> . <br>  This program is intended for viewing Internet, satellite and IP television.  There are paid and free versions.  I managed the free ProgDVB 7. <br>  The main reason for the possible difference is the impossibility of recording the video stream in the free version. <br>  With its help, I scanned the range of addresses of Rostelecom television. <br><br>  First start: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e07/cd0/5bf/e07cd05bf35e34de2fcb6718f04e7416.png"><br><br>  Click Channel list -&gt; Blind search (List of channels -&gt; Blind search), drive in a range of addresses and ports, click Start (Start): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0de/633/ff0/0de633ff0a1af522c1fc171b9e03bfd0.png"><br>  <b>Attention!</b>  <b>Scanning addresses depending on the specified range can take a very long time!</b> <br>  I set the approximate address range according to the data from a ready playlist taken from IP-TV Player. <br><br>  The whole range of 224.1.1.0 - 224.1.255.255 did not scan, because during the night the scan reached 224.1.25. *, And the last channel found had the address 224.1.2.254. <br><br>  A total of 264 channels were found in the list, including 2 radio stations (Love Radio and Radio Russia), several designated but non-working channels, several duplicate channels and a number of channels in foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äã(English, French, Korean). <br>  Then I can scan it again. <br><br>  A fragment of the playlist screen shows 2 radio stations, fully repetitive channels, as well as the same channel, but broadcast in different regions: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2a2/410/dc7/2a2410dc79ffd28fc34dc7715892ec25.png"><br><br>  As it turned out, this also happens (do not forget to set it in the ProgDVB settings, otherwise the English track will be included on such channels by default): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ac2/586/cce/ac2586cce6c9b04ad8a825c1dad15188.jpg"><br>  On the Amedia Premium HD channel, plug-in subtitles are also available in Russian. <br><br>  If your television broadcast is multicast, then you can try to set up the television on your computer.  You will need to download the original version of IP-TV Player and get playlists from your provider (they can probably be found on the web) or generate them yourself using the ProgDVB program. <br><br>  Thanks for attention.  I hope this information was useful to someone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218477/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218477/</a></p>
