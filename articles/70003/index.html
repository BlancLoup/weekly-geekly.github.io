During the summer - doubly.  The inexperienced reader of our blog, with good reason, might have thought: ‚ÄúThere is no news on the Gypsies.  It is understandable - everything is on vacation.  Rest all three months.  And during this period, you can be stupid to such an extent that the alphabet is forgotten. " <br>  Well, dear. <br><br>  All those who thought that we can afford to rest all summer, and even in the midst of the Crisis, and even during the election period, and with such leadership - at least naive. <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/53169db0-7ce6-479b-bb08-a39692eb88a7.jpg" alt="stopka"><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      We, dear readers, have worked.  Worked like no dream of the proletariat or the laboring peasantry. <br><br>  Artists, designers, programmers, accountants, director, and even a trio of customers who wandered in the corridor were sent to the fields, to galleys, to construction sites of the country, with the goal of earning at least some money. <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/6fdef6d6-9e4a-46dc-bbc4-1ac21f081ebf.jpg" alt="hand"><br><br>  Just today, everything gathered in the office and put money earned over the summer on the table.  Seeing such a fabulous sum, the workers could not keep the cry of joy! <br>  - Let's buy two packs of cigarettes!  - offered one.  - It will also remain on the lighter. <br>  - Nonsense nonsense!  - objected others.  - It is necessary to buy bread! <br>  - Nonsense!  - the director stopped everyone.  - First of all, you need to write about it to everyone in the blog. <br><br>  It was so.  And if someone does not believe us, let them try to earn at least some significant amount from galleys. <br>  From now on, we will try to write to the blog more often, more thoughtfully and follow the main goal of the whole project: To please you more often and to rejoice more often yourself. <br><br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/1bbbe2f5-8a7a-4198-a44f-5188dc324a46.jpg" alt="pack"><br><br>  And now - the first news: <br>  We are announcing a sale! <br>  Since, as experience has shown from a financial point of view, it is absolutely inefficient to try to sell personnel, and when trying to sell office equipment, sellers start laughing hysterically, we decided to sell something else. <br><br>  And in order to follow the old tradition of doing the opposite <br>  (recall steps: <br>  1. <a href="http://tsigan.ru/Donate.aspx">Start a project, and then look for money on it.</a> <br>  2. To <a href="http://tsigan.ru/bloh.aspx%3Fid%3D36">blind the model from plasticine and only then to think about whether it is needed.</a> <br>  3. <a href="http://tsigan.ru/bloh.aspx%3Fid%3D43">Make an animatic and only then figure out what an animatic is.</a> <br>  4. Itd, itp.) <br>  , we decided not to go the beaten path, and before we made gypsies with maps, we made maps with gypsies. <br><br>  These unique cards can be bought only from us. <br>  And the money received from the sale of this nice souvenir, we will spend on the project itself. <br><br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/8335f115-9749-4272-bb5a-a202a926a14e.jpg" alt="wer"><br><br>  Or, to put it simply, Gypsy cards should help us make Gypsy with cards. <br><br>  Generally: <br>  Fly, do not skimp, buy Painting! <br>  And finally, each of our characters has become a truly Trump Character. <br>  So in order: <br>  Cards from two to ten are not much different from ordinary playing cards. <br><br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/235fcf86-c927-4c3d-8cd2-ff129a76ff50.jpg" alt="2"><br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/a2c9fc62-a9b9-42d8-abe9-4ab50dbdd8e0.jpg"><br><br>  on 4 Jacks - the youngest member of the family, boy Tagar <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/39ecb478-8309-4e20-b014-a17a9b8b52e3.jpg" alt="Tagar"><br>  on 4 Damah - naturally, Zara, she is the only woman <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/ea65424c-d3b2-4e30-9c11-805f7cbbeed8.jpg" alt="Zara"><br>  on 4 Kings - Baro's grandfather, he is the oldest and wisest of all family members. <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/2194b0a4-6f69-4cab-9f93-1ae021bd9d69.jpg" alt="Baro"><br>  on 4 Aces - of course, Gojo, because this is our main character, the most trump character. <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/43fd91f4-2e52-4869-9a41-63a8e6914b3f.jpg" alt="Gojo"><br>  Death appears on two jokers because  she is the most powerful of all the characters <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/116d8b26-def6-4215-af9e-1839eed444f3.jpg" alt="death"><br>  Well, remembering that these are Gypsy cards, we added 4 more cards with Ilo turkey.  This character constantly confuses the cards in the multi, so the cards with Ilo are of a somewhat strange suit. <br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/65f9f50a-263f-4519-bf77-f26e9db3aeb4.jpg" alt="ilo"><br>  In total, we have a standard deck of 54 cards and four cheat cards so that the sleeve is not empty. <br><br><img src="http://tsigan.ru/images/ul/30bad2b5-3db9-4a2d-ba86-6e6ba442d833.jpg" alt="domik"><br>  But seriously: Like any project, we are trying to acquire related products.  Large companies have short films to the full meter, toys and paraphernalia from illustrations.  We have small video postcards and, from today, a deck of cards. <br>  The cards depict the characters of our cartoon.  This deck can be purchased only from us. <br>  Well and, of course, people who donated to our project will not only be noted in the cloud of gratitude, but will also be able to receive a gift of a deck of cards. <br>  <a href="http://tsigan.ru/">The site of the cartoon "Gypsy"</a> <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/70003/">https://habr.com/ru/post/70003/</a></p>
