      Let's take a look at the steps of the stages of the journey: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c90/4cf/0b5/c904cf0b57cd4936955c7896cdad27be.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1) need - need</b> <br>  At this stage we are dealing with a lead. <br>  Lead is your potential customer (appropriate for your target audience) <br>  It all starts with the fact that in the head of the lead, from the very beginning, it is necessary to ripen the need for a specific product / service. <br>  He has to think about what is potentially necessary for him. <br><br>  <b>2) interest - interest</b> <br>  As soon as this need begins to ripen in the head of the lead, he begins to develop an interest in your product / service. <br>  He starts thinking about it more and more. <br>  His logical step at this stage is to start searching for information on the topic of interest to him. <br>  The easiest and fastest way is to search the Internet. <br><br>  <b>The task of marketing at this stage: track - track.</b> <br><br>  Those.  using all possible communication channels to attract the attention of the lead. <br>  To form such an offer (offer) - from which it is not possible to refuse. <br><br>  <i>For example: a</i> company needs to hire a sales manager.  The task is assigned to the personnel department.  First of all, the personnel manager will look for him at specialized portals like hh.ru. <br>  On this portal, he can see a banner ad, which will attract his attention, with an offer of guaranteed manager hiring for a week, for example. <br><br>  The personnel manager will want to click on the banner and get acquainted with this offer. <br>  At this stage, marketing has completed its task: he tracked the lead. <br>  Tracked - it means recorded his click on the banner and go to the site.  For this there is specialized software that can do it. <br><br>  <b>3) visit - visit</b> <br><br>  <i>For example:</i> go to the site. <br><br>  <b>The task of marketing: capture - fix.</b> <br><br>  Fix, i.e.  get lead contacts (his phone, e-mail). <br>  Getting contacts is one of the very important steps. <br><br>  Why? <br>  Let's just take it. <br><br>  In order to attract the attention of the lead, for example, you placed a banner on hh.ru. <br>  For this banner you paid a certain amount of money. <br>  Economically, you need to return these investments and preferably with a profit. <br>  If you do not record the contacts of the leads, you will simply drive traffic to your site in the hope that the leads will call you. <br><br>  The probability of returning your investment in this case is very, very low. <br>  It is necessary to make attempts to increase this probability, and therefore attempts to get contacts of the lead. <br>  No attempt - no result. <br><br>  Here, as in hockey, for example: you do not throw at goal, it means you will never score. <br>  And to score, it is necessary to start to start throwing at the gate. <br><br>  <b>4) learn - study</b> <br>  At this stage, your lead begins to study, i.e.  collect as much information as possible about your product / service, your company, competitive offers, peers, etc. <br><br>  <b>The task of marketing: nurture - to grow</b> <br><br>  Growing up means keeping attention on yourself and developing an interest in your product, removing objections, risks, etc. <br><br>  How can this be done? <br><br>  For this you need to constantly be in sight. <br>  This is also called touch.  touch your lead. <br><br>  Touch is any interaction: <br>  a) sent an e-mail with a presentation of the company <br>  b) invited to the product webinar <br>  c) described the scheme of work with your company (in steps, so that everything was clear and transparent) <br><br>  At this stage it is necessary to increase confidence: <br>  a) to your product / service <br>  b) to your company <br><br>  For the organization of the system of such contacts, again, there is specialized software that allows you to automate the entire process. <br><br>  <b>4) return - return</b> <br>  Return means that at the previous stage of the study, your lead left your site and went to collect information and look for what else is on his subject. <br>  And if you did everything right at the previous stages, then this lead should return to you. <br>  Again, there are different tools for this. <br>  One of these tools: retargeting. <br>  This is when you clicked on a banner (ad) and then you see this ad on almost all other sites. <br><br>  <b>Marketing challenge: personalize - personalize you</b> , i.e.  define a specific lead and its needs in accordance with the criteria BANT (interest, budget, time, authority) <br>  After BANT is defined, the sales team is connected whose task is to make a sale using all the personal information about the lead that the marketing has collected <br><br>  <b>5) buy - buy</b> <br>  With competent collaboration of marketing and sales, the lead becomes a customer by making the first purchase. <br><br>  <b>The task of marketing: thank - thank you.</b> <br>  Thank you for your purchase, leave a good impression, show that the client has made the right choice. <br><br>  <b>6) repeat - repeat</b> <br>  Replay means a second purchase. <br>  Those.  customer return and implementation of a new sale. <br>  It is a well-known fact that selling an existing customer is much cheaper than attracting a new one. <br>  Therefore, it is impossible to forget about our customers, of course, and you need to organize a process for making repeat purchases. <br><br>  <b>Marketing task: recommend - recommendations</b> <br><br>  Make the client advise his friends / colleagues / relatives / acquaintances to contact your company and purchase your product. <br>  This is already a story about high-quality service, solving customer problems, and obtaining their stated benefits. <br>  Only after the client has solved his problem with the help of your product / service and is satisfied, he will recommend you to others. <br>  Here is a client's journey from the moment the need arises to the moment when your client conditionally becomes your promoter and recommends you to others. <br>  The company must clearly understand this path and correctly build its processes in each control point of this path.  Then the result will not take long. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/295858/">https://habr.com/ru/post/295858/</a></p>
