  <section class="page js-page"><h1>PocketBook 360. Book to the road</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Today, e-books based on e-ink displays are doing another round of development.  Manufacturers vied with each other about the imminent entry into the market of <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/gadgets/54946/">color</a> , sensory, two- <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/68936/">display</a> etc.  devices.  However, for most non-geeks, all this is for now only unnecessary things.  The consumer wants to just read.  Lot.  With convenience.  And right now. <br><br>  Fortunately, there are more or less decent reading rooms on sale, not burdened with vicious achievements of the national economy, increasing the amount on the price tag.  One of the last - appeared on sale in September 2009 - PocketBook 360. The thing is interesting, ambiguous from the point of view of positioning, but definitely worthy of attention. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb0/96d/b79/cb096db795ea8b86879ed7b0c492ba4d.jpg"><br>  <i>This is a concept.</i>  <i>Promotional photo.</i>  <i>Review and a few "live" photos of the Pocketbook 360 under the screen.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The PocketBook company has already managed to check out good products.  In particular, the previous ‚Äúhit‚Äù deserves praise - literally the folk reader <a href="http://dinozavr.habrahabr.ru/blog/68656/">PocketBook 301</a> .  The 6-inch display, high refresh rate and convenient control with not too high cost made it a good competitor for readers from well-known manufacturers, such as, for example, Sony.  Actually, in the wake of the relative success of the 301st, PocketBook continues to release new, equally interesting models.  There are plenty of plans, but today there is only one new product - PocketBook 360.

      This is a 5-dyumovy reader that retains all the functional advantages of the previous model (in addition to the ability to play sound).  However, by reducing the form factor, the novelty entered into competition not only with similar models of readers, but also with other portable devices.  Such as smartphones and communicators, budget netbooks and tablet PCs.  Given the possibilities, among which reading books is just one of many, in order to compete with them, the PocketBook 360 mobile reader must have a couple of trump cards up its sleeve. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/008/cfc/04e/008cfc04e7ca945b6e1cab26e3bc1c71.jpg"><br>  <i>This is what Pocketbook 301 and Pocketbook 360 look like next.</i>  <i>The difference is more than noticeable.</i> <br><br>  <b>Design and ergonomics</b> <br>  The dimensions of the PocketBook 360 are 124x145x10 mm without a lid (124x145x12 mm with a lid) with a weight of 146 and 178 grams (with and without lid, respectively).  The reader is compact, looks solid and gives the impression of integrity.  Not only looks: high-quality assembly has left no chance of any backlash, or squeaks, or noticeable gaps between the panels. <br><br>  The style for which the overall design is responsible, as well as such elements as smooth lines and rounded edges of the case, the 360th is also not deprived.  The material used is pleasant to the touch and not easily soiled plastic.  The drawback from the point of view of design is only one: the presence of a cover provided for the safety of the display.  It performs its functions, literally attached with a bang, and practically does not interfere.  But it is simply not needed.  The version with a leather case is much more acceptable, more functional and aesthetic.  And it is possible to score at all in defense, since it is still hard to come up with anything better than <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ebooks/26616/">bags</a> .  ;) <br><br>  The case, however, is: soft and with a magnetic strap fastener of a special "design" that facilitates the process of removing the device.  But it is only suitable for transportation, as it is made in the style of "purse", and not a book.  If PocketBook releases a normal case for this model instead of a cover, then the buyer will be only too happy.  In general, this is the only drawback in terms of design and appearance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2e1/199/91c/2e119991c14945cdb0a856f73ccfa597.jpg"><br>  <i>Cover Pocketbook 360 is needed only for carrying.</i> <br><br>  For ease of use of the device in the PocketBook 360, there is a four-way joystick with a selection button in the center and two large page turning keys.  It is better to forget about the latter, since when designing them, more attention was paid to appearance rather than convenience: a tight turn is pressed with effort and a loud click.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äã"fails," but the buttons are fully duplicated by the most convenient joystick, with which you can control all the functions of the reader, ranging from navigating through the menu and ending with page turning. <br><br>  The upper edge of the device is a slot for MicroSD format cards and a button operating in two modes (hold on / off, short press to lock the control buttons).  The bottom end is a miniUSB connector for communication with a PC.  Headphone jack no.  The reason is the already mentioned absence of the audio playback function in the reader. <br><br>  It is worth noting that the design of the reading room allows you to hold it with both, and one hand.  The main thing is that this is true for any position of the device in space.  PocketBook 360 is equipped with a gyroscope, which automatically rotates the image on the display in accordance with the position of the device.  Hence, by the way, the number 360 in the title. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/706/099/b77/706099b772952a954d55dfffcd68333e.jpg"><br>  <i>Pocketbook 360 is available in two colors - black for boys and white for girls.</i> <br><br>  <b>Display and stuffing</b> <br>  Display in the PocketBook 360 - E-Ink Vizplex second generation.  Resolution 600x800 pixels, size - 5 inches.  Advantages - good contrast and whiteness, high refresh rate.  Disadvantages - the size of the diagonal is too small for the "home" device.  After 10-, 8-, and even 6-inch displays, the five-inch cam looks a bit small.  However, for the mobile form factor is what you need.  And reading on such a little one, considering that he, while reducing the size, kept the technical characteristics of the 6-inch screen used in the PocketBook 301, is simply a pleasure.  Much better than cheap toilet paper, on which the tabloid novels of the endless Marinins and Dontsovs are printed.  And the size of the PocketBook 360 just corresponds to the format of these small, if I may say so, little books. <br><br>  The Samsung S3C2440 AL-40 processor with a frequency of 400 MHz is responsible for the work of the reader.  The user has 64 MB of RAM and 512 MB of internal memory.  The power of the processor and the amount of memory is more than enough for the functioning of the software shell and the execution of all necessary applications.  A built-in half a gigabyte of memory provides the right amount of storage for a good collection of books.  If this is not enough, then microSD cards, the slot for which is provided in the PocketBook 360, are not expensive and are available at any IT store.  By the way, the reader, when connected to a PC, behaves like a real flash drive, is quickly recognized, quickly writes and, in between times, charges the battery.  Which, by the way, is characterized by a capacity of 1000 mAh and allows you to update the display 7000 times. <br><br>  <b>Software and work nuances</b> <br>  The Pocketbook 360 uses the time-tested operating system PocketBook OS.  It is almost the same set of software that was used in the previous model.  The ‚Äúedits‚Äù are only cosmetic: there is no audio player, the interface is improved, the functions of working with the gyro sensor, etc. are added.  on trifles.  The main characteristic of the OS - speed.  The device turns on in about 10 seconds, updates the display in a fraction of a second, quickly opens books and doesn‚Äôt think much over time when processing large files. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3e2/725/16c/3e272516c7aa8d6faf89f9136c11dbdc.jpg"><br>  <i>A simple and clear menu with a large number of functions is an unambiguous advantage.</i> <br><br>  The main menu is a regular list: "Books", "News", "Favorites", "Photos", "Dictionary", "Applications", "Notes", "Calendar" and "Settings".  The names are "talking", so let's go selectively.  The choice of books is the responsibility of the file manager with the necessary minimum of amenities, such as displaying files as a list, extended list or ‚Äúcover,‚Äù viewing folders with attachments at n levels, etc. <br><br>  PocketBook 360 is omnivorous.  From text formats, it works correctly with FB2, TXT, PDF, DJVU, RTF, HTML, PRC, CHM, EPUB, DOC, and from graphic formats (this already applies to the ‚ÄúPhotos‚Äù section) - JPEG, BMP, GIF.  In the "News" section you can read RSS feeds by first rewriting them to the reader using a special program installed on your PC.  "Dictionary" allows on the fly to clarify the meaning of a word.  "Applications" is full of toys, including battleships, chess, etc.  and useful programs.  As for the "Settings", then you can find a sufficient number of options for changing the font, choosing the interface language, setting up the gyro sensor, etc. <br><br>  Separately, you should pay attention to the speed of the device and once again walk through the user interface.  PocketBook 360 smartly turns on, opens files with high speed, and almost instantly updates the screen.  When testing to download an RTF file with a volume of about 3 MB, the device spent an average of five attempts (total) and 14 seconds.  As a result, a full cycle from switching on to the beginning of reading takes no more than a quarter of a minute.  Large-volume PDF files are a nuisance, but within reason.  The interface of the reader is logical and simple, due to the execution of the joystick and convenient functions (for example, operations with pop-up context menu or simple manipulations with fonts) allows you to manage the book without "getting used". <br><br>  <b>Total</b> <br>  So, the asset trumps PocketBook 360 has an excellent design, ergonomics, speed and ease of operation, which are responsible for the proven and functional operating system and a completely modern hardware stuffing.  It only hinders the price, a little more than $ 300.  For this reason, a mobile reader with a small display will be difficult to find its place in the market.  Otherwise, reading this book is a pleasure. <br><br>  <b>Technical specifications Pocketbook 360</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd3/ad0/32a/fd3ad032a4534ff39125f8b4d790d0b6.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Advantages:</b> <br>  Great design, ergonomic <br>  Clear and contrast display <br>  Control of all functions of the reader by joystick <br>  Gyro sensor and automatic image pickup <br>  Long term work without recharging <br><br>  <b>Disadvantages:</b> <br>  Waste cap <br>  Inconvenient "main" page turning buttons <br><br>  The device is provided for testing by the representative of the manufacturer in Belarus <a href="http://pocketbook.by/">PocketBook.by</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75401/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75401/</a></p>
