Cloud solutions provide many advantages, such as greater flexibility for integration with the technologies you already use, the ability to adapt the process more easily in the future, cost effectiveness and ease of use by both staff and customers. <br><br>  If you decide to use the cloud, you should start with two important steps that will allow you to take a successful start and achieve a result that will meet your needs. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Explore the clouds.  Step 1 </h5><br>  The first important step is to create a team of key specialists in your organization who can identify key tasks related to communications, explore various solutions and, ultimately, ensure the successful deployment of cloud technologies.

      Each organization is unique, and the roles in it are different from each other, but in any case, there must be a qualified team that will start with a comprehensive survey and complete the work by successfully deploying the system.  It may seem tempting to create a large committee, but all that is really needed is a team of three people. <br><br>  To effectively accomplish this mission, your team must be well-versed in the current state of affairs, including existing hardware, software, problems, competitive conditions, and take into account the strategic direction and future goals of your business.  In addition, the team should have a holistic view of your company and industry, it should clearly represent the needs of those departments that are affected by the change. <br><br>  In general, this team will determine the requirements and actions, assess how a particular supplier is able to meet these requirements, and ensure successful implementation of the best solution in your organization. <br><br>  Let's take a closer look at what each member of your team should contribute. <br><br>  <b>Ideological leader.</b>  An ideological leader must have a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe task and be a representative of top management, for example, the head of the IT department or executive director.  In addition to understanding the overall strategic goals and objectives of the organization, the ideological leader must have the authority to ensure the implementation of decisions made.  This is not an easy job: it is important not only to involve the entire organization in the work, the ideological leader must have the will to negotiate, break ties with existing suppliers, and sometimes defend the best solutions (even if they are not popular). <br><br>  <b>Technical expert.</b>  A technical expert should have not only a detailed understanding of the information environment and communication systems, but also be aware of new technological alternatives.  Usually this is an employee of the IT department, and he must be an informal expert in technical matters.  The technical expert knows in detail the hardware, software, system layout, contract terms, general requirements, and other information related to the operation of the contact center.  He should also be able to evaluate the solutions offered by partners. <br><br>  <b>Business analyst.</b>  The business analyst is a complementary technical expert.  He clearly understands the process of moving data.  He is knowledgeable about the business processes of the organization, he is well aware of how work processes affect staff and customers.  The business analyst should be able to focus on weak points in business processes and make recommendations leading to the elimination of deficiencies.  An effective business analyst takes into account the interests of both customers and staff, and also understands how the contact center supports other areas, such as sales and accounting.  He may be a contact center manager or a team and may be an ideal candidate to be a project manager, paying attention to details and the current state of the project. <br><br><h5>  Explore the clouds.  Step 2 </h5><br>  The team is ready, the plan for moving to a result that meets the goals of both the company and the department is clear.  For example, are you trying to direct the workflow in such a way as to save time?  Or maybe you intend to increase customer satisfaction?  Perhaps you want to increase the productivity of your operators by optimizing their work scenarios.  Whatever your goals, be sure there is a universal and one wish.  A solid plan based on objective reality will allow you to monitor the course of negotiations with suppliers and correctly evaluate the proposed solutions. <br><br>  In the process of selecting a supplier, consider a few initial questions: <br><br>  Can you explain how your infrastructure works? <br>  How do you control the performance and lifetime of the equipment? <br>  How does your support team work? <br>  Is the chosen solution in your business interests?  What standards of compliance do you support? <br>  How technical specifications fit your needs? <br>  Does the solution support scaling if your business expands? <br>  Is it easy to add licenses? <br>  Is it possible to integrate the solution with existing systems? <br>  How difficult is management and what tools are needed to manage the system? <br>  How will you deploy and support? <br>  Look for a durable, reliable solution, look for suppliers who can offer a plurality of solutions, then appreciate the key differences of each.  In doing so, you will clearly understand each decision, and which of them will best meet the goals and objectives of your organization. <br><br>  Suppliers who, deep down, have not realized your vital interests, may try to sell you ideas and technologies that do not meet your interests or have an abundance of characteristics that will not sustain your budget.  But suppliers who sincerely want to see your success will honestly answer questions and adapt the proposed solutions in a direction that leads to the prosperity of your business. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236369/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236369/</a></p>
