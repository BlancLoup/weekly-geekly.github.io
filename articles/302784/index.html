Pay it by the hour or maybe for the whole project.  Freelancers write, design, advise, advise, pay taxes and glue wallpapers.  Freelance - the only, the easiest way to start a new business. <br><br>  Entrepreneurs use money (mostly <i>not their own</i> money) to create a larger business.  Entrepreneurs "earn" even when they sleep.  Entrepreneurs focus on the growth and proportionality of the systems they create.  The bigger, the better.

      The goal of a freelancer is to have a permanent job without a boss, so that there is a lot of work, so that demand gradually grows and, accordingly, hourly wages, as well as the quality of orders, grow. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The goal of the entrepreneur is to sell the created for big money or to build a "machine for long-term profit", which will be stable, stable and not very dangerous in operation.  The entrepreneur creates a structure that makes changes to the environment. <br><br>  The fallacy is simple: sometimes a freelancer awakens the desire to do business, and he begins to hire other freelancers to work for himself.  This does not change anything.  <i>Administration of freelancers is different from direct freelancers.</i>  Administering freelancers and saving the best projects for yourself creates a problem for you.  Cash payment creates a problem for you.  Investors do not want to invest in you, because you cannot sell if you are a freelancer in your heart. <br><br>  If you are an entrepreneur, it is impossible to succeed by filling in some omissions with your own work, because your work opportunities are limited.  You can not change one.  If the work is such that only you can do it, then you do not create a system - you just hire yourself (and probably underpay, right?). <br><br>  This <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/the-difference-between-a-freelancer-and-an-entrepreneur-seth-godin/">problem</a> appears at many times from time to time, and it is pleasant to think that, having put more efforts, we can solve it - that we can be in both forms at once.  New tools give freelancers more means to achieve goals than ever before, and our culture continues to make us grow right now. <br><br>  The bottom line is that greater effort cannot solve this dilemma for you.  Sooner or later it will become clear that increasing efforts does not change anything.  Travis Kalanik, the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/276852/">founder</a> of the Uber service, does not drive a taxi you call through his system;  Sheryl Sandberg, a member of the Facebook Board of Directors, does not write programs, and Jacqueline Novograc, head of the Social Entrepreneurship Foundation (USA), cannot do every investment every day. <br><br><h4>  But the solution to the problem is surprisingly simple. </h4><br>  <b>If you are a freelancer, then continue to do this.</b>  Evaluate how to do the best job in your area, perfect for the right clients.  Do not be discouraged by failed orders and periodic downtime.  You are a free freelancer and should focus on your reputation and running your own business.  Find funds in the form of assistants and give some orders to the side if you can;  but your work will always be your job. <br><br>  The demand for freelancers is growing, they are earning more and more (and deservedly so).  They develop, becoming more communicative, more capable, more effective. <br><br>  <b>If you are an entrepreneur, then do not hire yourself.</b>  Build a business that works, that thrives with or without you.  It may hit on your ego, but it will be useful for your bank account. <br><br>  You can change the direction of work, have parallel projects, have two "cases".  But we cannot simultaneously fulfill both roles;  freelancing is not the path to entrepreneurial success. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302784/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302784/</a></p>
