(I gasped a bit when I learned that there are <a href="http://www.crowdsourcing.org/editorial/global-crowdfunding-market-to-reach-344b-in-2015-predicts-massolutions-2015cf-industry-report/45376">1,250</a> active crowdfunding platforms in the world.) Since I have a habr defect, I found all the projects in the field of information security (and a couple of projects were suggested by the hackerspace guys). <br><br>  <b>10% is the share of technology startups</b> at Kickstarter (they eventually collected about 118,000,000 dollars). <br>  Yes, crowdfunding is perfectly sharpened on any useless, but cool crap.  Kickstarter collects loot for salad and rubber handles (16 barreled wooden machine gun of the Gatling system), and on other platforms they implement the ‚Äúrule 34‚Äù for space and for the joy of the old Freud type <s>cigar</s> organs.  But there are also hacker projects, some of which are quite serious.  As for ordinary users (flash drives with biometrics), and for professional pentesters (analyzer attacks on third-party channels for iron).

      I propose to evaluate the ideas of the projects (the depth of technical descriptions) and the sense of humor of the developers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Myths and Facts about Kickstarter </h4><br>  I saw with my own eyes how the guys from <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/cubicrobotics/blog/233165/">CubicRobotics</a> updated the page with statistics on IGG every minute.  I also helped a little with the draft <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/231545/">book about Venus</a> , and now I'm carrying out plans to launch a <s>shahid belt</s> project of <s>loyalty</s> belts for the development of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetoception">magnetoreception</a> (the first prototype of which we soldered to schoolchildren <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/261041/">in the camp this summer</a> ). <br><br>  Therefore, I wonder what pieces the campaign on Kickstarter consists of.  I made a selection of projects using the following examples: work with the media, video quality, game mechanics, visualization of awards and goals, interaction with the community, sense of humor, depth of technical descriptions. <br><br>  Independent analysis of projects - a powerful thing.  For example, there is a myth that only gadgets or desktops are successful at Kickstarter.  I found okolokhakerskie projects, tutorials, research, software projects, iron and paper solutions.  Or another misconception that the video must be expensive - I witnessed how they spent 10,000 dollars on the set.  Examples of IB projects demonstrate that you can shoot video both in the studio and on a webcam. <br><br>  During the preparation, I was able to talk a bit with ‚Äúour man‚Äù in Silicon Valley, which helps to ‚Äúhack citizenship restrictions on Kickstarter‚Äù, here he is a real myth destroyer and a specialist in cultural codes.  Who knows why you can not congratulate the girls on March 8 Kickstarter? <br><br>  A record holder in the field of information security collected more than $ 700,000, and another project was notable for attracting 1,200 backers (those who "voted with money") in the first 24 hours.  Russian activity on Kikstarter is as follows: <b>15,000 Russians</b> contributed a total of 3,350,000 dollars. <br><br>  <b>Wednesday</b> is the most active day of the week for Kickstarter users.  Date of the month - 13. <br>  I publish an article on Thursday, the 6th, but in the article I use one of the popular game mechanics - ‚Äústretch goals‚Äù.  This is such a thing, borrowed from the games, when after taking the next height, a new nishtyachok opens. <br><br><h4>  Cybersecurity projects </h4><br><br><h5>  <b>Cybrary MOOC IT and Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSecurity</b> </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/790/008/cb4/790008cb4fe145d597fb9e40f53780c3.jpg" align="left">  <b>Cybrary</b> : The world's first free MOOC (Multi-user online course) about information technology and cybersecurity.  For each.  For any level.  Is free.  Forever and ever. <br><br>  The Cybrary.IT platform offers free MOOCs for IT specialists.  There are now 20 online courses on system and network administration and cybersecurity available for obtaining certification from beginner to advanced levels (Ethical Hacker, CISSP, CCNA, CompTIA A +) and niche skills (deployment of Microsoft Exchange). <br><br>  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Cybrary.IT project is to eliminate financial barriers for IT professionals in constantly improving their skills and make the field accessible to talented professionals from low-income segments of the population. <br><br>  A teacher with a class of 20 students will be able to use additional tools for free, and if you use Cybrary.it for the whole school, you will have to pay from two to ten thousand dollars a year.  For this money, it will be possible to follow the progress in passing pupils' material, organize the activities of several teachers at once, and make up complete curricula from the materials of the site. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a2/2e1/e64/8a22e1e6466b4ab59a478409d0298857.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/789/3f5/01d/7893f501d8c20f8ae390b6f645688283.png" alt="image" align="right">  <b>Chips:</b> filling in advance with the content of your <a href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzWPaANpPISEE_xvJm8lqHA/videos">channel on YouTube</a> , where you can find several demos with teachers. <br><br>  The amount collected, continue to be published on <a href="http://blog.hackersonlineclub.com/2015/06/interview-with-cybrary-co-founder-ryan.html">hacker resources</a> .

For example, the same CYBRARY collected, rather, contrary to, and not thanks to the efforts of its authors.  This is evident in the <a href="http://www.kicktraq.com/projects/1195785519/cybrary-the-worlds-first-free-it-and-cyber-securit/">schedule of fees</a> </li><li>  Flash drives were collected well in past years.  Recently, they clearly go out of fashion. </li><li>  Spy stuff always attracts attention.  Therefore, all kinds of ‚Äúbugs‚Äù will attract more attention than security solutions, especially against online threats.  The goals should be simple and clear: ‚Äútake over the world and not let anyone see their passwords‚Äù. </li><li>  Not always what seems to be true, everyone lies.  If you compare the schedules of fees for Cybrary, JackPair, Webcloak and The Glitch projects, Enigmaze, you can see that the first ones have a broken schedule, with sharp jumps, especially at the end of the campaign, and with a slight excess of a goal (except for JackPair, where they clearly did not calculate forces) sign of boost, i.e.  a sharp injection of large amounts for the "successful" completion of the project.  The authors clearly realized that if they did not throw some of their money through the cards of friends, they would leave with nothing.  The second group of projects has a smooth and organic growth schedule, with a significant excess of the amount of the goal.  It means there was a correct work with the press and the correct hit in the expectations of the audience. </li><li>  The price of a standard lot is important.  Phenomenally high fees at Novena are explained only by the phenomenally high price of prizes.  It is obvious that the cost of this project is the highest.  In fact, it is necessary to compare the amount of fees with the number of project backers.  The second higher, the more successful the project. </li><li>  Video.  Contrary to steadily retransmitted urban legends about the most advanced availability of high-quality video, as often happens, cause and effect are confused here.  High-quality studio video can afford projects that easily can afford to buy a large amount of advertising and participate in numerous exhibitions and conferences.  Therefore, I deliberately omit video analysis in all the listed projects.  Let me just say that the presence of a video within 2-3 minutes should be normal, in which clearly, in English without an accent, the product itself is told and you can look into the honest eyes of its creators before giving them your money.  In addition, in the Enigmaze project at the moment I don‚Äôt watch any video at all.  And its total amount of fees is comparable to Cybrary and The Glitch, not to mention relative to the initial goal amount. </li><li>  For a more accurate analysis, it is necessary to monitor the mention of each project in the press, look at how much the marketing campaign has started before the start of the fees, check for the presence of well-known personalities in the team, and many other factors that directly affect the results of the fees. </li><li>  <b>Kicktraq.com</b> Need to take a lot of parameters and sit down to check.  Kicktraq should be mastered first of all in order to understand on schedule what is going on behind the scenes.  But it is necessary to be able to ‚Äúread‚Äù it - this is the same as the exchange players try to understand the growth / decline trends according to the graphs.  There can not be taught, you just have to do it regularly.  Then googling is connected on the subject of articles about the project, according to where they wrote and what they wrote, you can try to make a picture about the creators, how long they have been promoting the project and what they had before the start of the campaign at the COP.  In general, here reverse engineering, only in terms of investigation. <br></li></ul><br><br></div></div><br><br><h4>  Competition </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fb/b8e/aa5/7fbb8eaa5a67497097f78022b9eb0d48.jpg"><br><br>  Everyone probably has acquaintances who are <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/243787/">conducting experiments with cold nuclear fusion</a> in the garage. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c71/b7e/410/c71b7e41041f43dd84dfe318f4bd1f69.jpg" align="right"><br>  Perhaps they want to bring their project to the crowdfunding platform, or maybe they (like proud hedgehogs) should be kicked for this. <br>  Share briefly the essence of the project (in the comments or on the email alexey.stacenko (pack) gmail.com), for our part, being biased and inadequate, we will give two invites <a href="http://tceh.com/edu/crowdfunding/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_term%3Dhacker%26utm_content%3Ddn%26utm_campaign%3Dcrowdfunding">for the Kickstarter campaign creation course</a> .
