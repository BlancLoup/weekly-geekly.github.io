Having read and heard a lot on TV, radio, internet news about the crisis, I came across a very interesting phenomenon on the Moscow housing market. <br>  It seems that all the media in all the "pipes" shout that the activity of customers has subsided, interest has disappeared, prices are getting cheaper, and so on ... <br>  Plus Luzhkov‚Äôs statement that Moscow will now buy real estate in Moscow at <a href="http://news.mail.ru/politics/2173753/">lower prices</a> . <br>  But as they say, "the head is afraid, and the hands are doing" - A need appeared in the apartment. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Stage 2 - Determining Needs 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"

      <br>
      Here is the characteristic of the apartment: <br>  Not new building <br>  3 bedroom <br>  area&gt; 70m <br>  price to: 5,400,000 rubles <br>  Location: The sleeping areas of Moscow, or near Moscow. (Mytishchi, Krasnogorsk) <br>  And one more condition was the inspection of the apartment after 19.00 or on weekends (as people work on weekdays) <br><br>  Stage 3 - Search. <br>  As a person who knows how to use the Internet, and knowing a little about this issue, I immediately learned that most of the apartments in Moscow (Moscow region) are for sale through the joint base of realtors, immediately bought access to it (I‚Äôll just say that the issue price is 2000r per month). <br>  As expected, my request showed a lot of apartments, agencies and realtors.  Began a systematic review of real proposals that are interested.  They revealed about 20 pieces. <br><br>  And so by the end of the search I determined the place where I need an apartment, as Krasnogorsk or Mytishchi wrote above, but Krasnogorsk attracted more, by the fact that it is located just at the place where clean air enters the Capital city (this is enough to determine just) + right in the same Krasnogorsk infrastructure is being actively developed and the Moscow Regional Government "moved" there.  Mytishchi is an already formed city, with its own working infrastructure, where everything is already built and everything works. <br><br>  Stage 4 - Inspection. <br><br>  This is where the most interesting thing began. <br>  Of the 20 realtors with whom we phoned and made an appointment, on the day of the meeting "responded" (ie, they phoned again and gave an exact confirmation of the meeting) only 10. The rest began to give different reasons not to meet.  2nd They didn‚Äôt take the tube anymore, 3e all the time they were called were in terrible traffic jams and asked to postpone the meeting for tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.  Another 5 people gave false advertisements (either the price did not correspond to the declared one, or the housing did not fit the specified parameters. <br><br>  In general, the impression was that either people (realtors) do not really need ‚Äúreal money‚Äù (because every now and then everyone talks about <a href="http://news.mail.ru/video/2025130/">their lack</a> ), or everything in the economy is so stable that the flow of money from the population is not at all need </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48579/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48579/</a></p>
