  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why Facebook offers are not in a hurry to blow up the news feed?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  When Facebook launched its <b>Facebook offers</b> for pages - I thought that they would really blow up each user's news feed.  But this did not happen, and I will try to suggest why. <br><br>  [the <i>part with the description of what Facebook offers is added later due to the fact that, as it turned out, many people do not know this</i> ] <br>  <a href="http://www.facebook.com/help/184217158375330/">Facebook offers</a> - special offers on Facebook, which business pages with more than 500 likes can offer to social network users.  Offers became available to our pages at the end of September of this year. <br>  For example: get a cup of coffee for free, get a discount on our washing machines, download a free book / program / whatever, and so on.  A person sees in his news feed a special type of publication - an offer.  He sees the avatar of the offer, its name, and bold text "get offer".  When he clicks "get offer" - all his friends will see that he received it.  In addition, they will see it at the very top of their news feeds marked ‚Äúsponsored‚Äù.  Anyone who has received an offer will receive instructions and terms on the mail as he can use it.  For example, come to the cafe and say such a code, or click on the link, enter the code and download our new album for free and so on. <br><br>  To create an offer is very simple.  To do this, click on the appropriate menu item and select the offer:

I will share my surprise about this: when I tested this then new option, in three days several thousand people clicked ‚Äúget offer‚Äù;  saw an offer of more than 90 thousand users - despite the fact that before that the most ‚Äúseen‚Äù was a post with 29 thousand views.  And the massive audience reach is viral.  Organic and paid - somewhere equally and each brought about 3-5 thousand views. <br><br>  Facebook offers have much more powerful viral potential than even polls: as with polls, everyone who received an offer automatically ‚Äútold‚Äù this to all his friends.  But in the offers, plus to this, ‚Äúsponsorship‚Äù was also built in initially - that is, promotion of publication for fans and friends of fans. <br><br>  Why do companies not offer (or offer little) Facebook offers?  I think because: <br><br>  1. It is not free.  Depending on the potentially desirable audience - from $ 5 to "differently".  On the other hand, it is not a pity for paid advertising of money, why is it a pity for offers? <br><br>  2. Snobbery: this is something new, they did not try, and why change anything at all if everything ‚Äúworks‚Äù as it is. <br><br>  3. The option is available only for pages with more than 500 likes.  Who has a cozy cafe in a relatively small town, but the FB page likes, for example, 300 - unfortunately, they cannot offer an offer. <br><br>  4. Companies feel sorry for ‚Äúoffering‚Äù something (giving, making discounts, etc.) to their Facebook audience.  Yes, yes, the same cup of coffee is not free, and a 20% discount is also quite noticeable. <br><br>  5. Companies do not want to bother with the process (for offline offers) - that is, to train employees how and what to do if a person comes for an offer.  For example, a person comes for a free cup of coffee - the barista should be instructed and know what to do, and not look at the visitor with square eyes.  You could see such square eyes, for example, when you came for 4sk specialist - really, it was like that :) <br><br>  6. Company managers simply do not know what it is, Facebook offers. <br><br>  In general, do not take the $ 5-10, try at least out of purely sporting interest, I think you will like it :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/164435/">https://habr.com/ru/post/164435/</a></p>
