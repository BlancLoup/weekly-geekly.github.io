  <section class="page js-page"><h1>What is most lacking in freelancing?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  April is the month. <br>  I quit my job and began to think what to do next. <br>  On the one hand, a lot of freelancing allows for some time not to get a job.  Again, take a vacation.  In the new work, I don‚Äôt think that they will meet me and will give at least a week even at their own expense, because if they are looking for a designer, then he is needed for work. <br><br>  On the other hand, it is better to get settled before the summer, while joining the team, working on extra money and already working full out in the fall. <br><br>  In general, I decided to stay on freelancing, which in practice would be felt, I knew about it only in theory. <br><a name="habracut"></a>  This is what I was most afraid of in freelancing: <br>  1. Something that does not force itself to work. <br>  2. A lot of distractions. <br>  3. Lack of standing orders. <br>  4. Not profitability, without the lack of freelance experience.

      And as it turned out, this had nothing to do with reality.  It turned out to be very easy to get myself to work, a week later I got used to it and worked about the same as when I worked in the office + at home.  At the same time I slept more and finished by 8-9 in the evening.  Fortunately, the summer is still full. <br><br>  And I must say that, after a month, I was even glad that I left for freelancing.  I thought that in principle I do not want to work in the office anymore.  But‚Ä¶ <br><br>  After a while, I caught myself thinking that I could not escape from work at all.  Even when I‚Äôve already finished, I‚Äôm pulling it down to finish something.  I overcame this habit at the beginning of a working day with a schedule for a working day (say 4/5 for projects, 1/5 for developing ideas).  And also helped the paper, on which the idea was sketched and forgotten until the morning.  A lot of useful things for myself, I got it on Habr√© to optimize work at home. <br><br>  - the second moment, due to the fact that the efficiency has increased (and significantly).  I began to make more orders.  Accordingly, less time is spent on training, reading articles in the net, which may come in handy at work. <br><br>  - The third moment, after which I realized that besides the salary, work in the office gives it was said. <br>  Let me explain with examples.  When my wife came home from work, I could sit in her ear and talk without ceasing until she fell asleep.  I went after her around the apartment and something was babbling all the time.  When my friends came to visit me, in my opinion they could not speak a word for the evening.  And the funny thing is when I went for interviews (after 5-6 months I decided to get an office), they could last 2-3 hours. <br>  I'm not exaggerating =) <br><br>  Answering the question posed from the very beginning: ‚ÄúWhat is most lacking in freelancing?‚Äù <br>  I answer: ‚ÄúCOMMUNICATIONS WITH LIVING PEOPLE‚Äù With those who understand you, with like-minded people.  Every day, during the breaks, lunch, on the way home, even during working hours, even if you have a beer right after the work-after-work-at-the-half-hour cup. <br><br>  If someone has their own thoughts about this, I will be glad to hear. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/39888/">https://habr.com/ru/post/39888/</a></p>
