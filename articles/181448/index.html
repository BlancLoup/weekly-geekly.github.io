      Details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  What is a special economic zone?  For those who have not encountered this phrase, I will explain: special economic zones (SEZ) is a large-scale federal project aimed at developing regions by attracting direct Russian and foreign investments in high-tech industries, import-substituting production, shipbuilding and tourism.  Special economic zones are divided into 4 types: industrial, tourist, technological and logistic. <br><br>  We became resident of one of them - the special economic type ‚ÄúDubna‚Äù, in 2011 and, having studied everything in practice, we can tell you about the relationship between the desired and the actual preferences for residents of the special economic zone TVT ‚ÄúDubna‚Äù. <br><br>  The first thing I‚Äôll tell you about is preferences, which are described <a href="http://dubna-oez.ru/about_oez/">to</a> us <a href="http://dubna-oez.ru/about_oez/">on sites at the first acquaintance with the SEZ</a> . <br><blockquote>  The policy of granting state preferences to resident companies in the territory of the Dubna SEZ is pursued: <br>  - prepared office and laboratory facilities <br></blockquote><br>  There are office-laboratory premises, but, judging by <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/nordavind/blog/177671/">our article</a> , not all of them have been successfully designed ... <br><br><blockquote>  land plots with completely constructed entrances and engineering networks - without competition and prior approval </blockquote><br>  Perhaps without contests and prior approval, but everything else is in the future. <br><br><blockquote>  apartments for top managers and leading specialists </blockquote><br>  Sad moment ... The only house is being built since 2011, and now it is not only not ready for commissioning, but also not completed ... <br><br><blockquote>  data transmission channels (up to 20-800 Gbit.s) </blockquote><br>  But the channels are available, although in the spring they were unexpectedly damaged by not quite sober people with an excavator.  We must pay tribute, a couple of days restored. <br><br><blockquote>  tax incentives (payments to funds - 14%, 10 - summer vacation on property taxes, land, income tax - 13.5%) </blockquote><br>  The most HUGE plus, which no doubt everyone uses, and which pleases and attracts residents. <br><br><blockquote>  STZ customs regime - duty-free importation of equipment and materials for own consumption, determination of the country of origin of products based on the depth of processing of products </blockquote><br>  Everything would be fine, but red tape is ‚Äúhigher than the roof,‚Äù because even for organizing a person‚Äôs pass, everything has to be coordinated with customs representatives.  With the introduction of equipment, everything is easy and simple, but for the removal, we have to prepare a dozen of papers confirming that the equipment being removed will not be exported outside our state. <br><br><blockquote>  targeted training of specialists at the University "Dubna" and other universities of the country </blockquote><br>  If the company does not take care of the training itself, no one will take care ... This is the truth of life ... Checked for yourself. <br><br><blockquote>  development of cooperative ties within the country's largest nanocluster </blockquote><br>  The cluster has been around for about a year; they have not yet felt any clear benefits for the company.  Probably, those cooperative relations will develop further. <br><br>  Now I will talk about the social infrastructure of a special economic zone. <br><br><blockquote>  To provide temporary accommodation for invited young highly qualified specialists, 2 apartment-type dormitories have been built at the expense of the budget of the Russian Federation and the local budget. </blockquote>  (at the other end of the city), <blockquote>  polyclinic </blockquote>  (not built, but reconstructed) <blockquote>  Palace of Sports </blockquote>  (very modern and near the special zone), <blockquote>  reconstruction of access roads </blockquote>  (apparently, yes, since the roads are really good, even there is a helipad). <br><br><blockquote>  Specialists of resident companies will have the opportunity to purchase housing on mortgage terms </blockquote><br>  The only pity is that the conditions of the mortgage are almost the same as for the rest, but in the construction of new houses on the territory adjacent to the SEZ, the staff of the resident companies is a priority. <br><br><blockquote>  The design of the school, kindergarten, first residential buildings for specialists of the SEZ resident companies in the adjacent territory is being completed. </blockquote><br>  Attention!  It‚Äôs not the construction that ends, but the design ... It ends ... What would it mean? .. <br><br><blockquote>  Innovative - technological center </blockquote><br>  I must say that this is really a very beautiful and modern building with a refined territory (see the first photo of the article). <br><br>  And now about what no one writes on any site ... And what is really an important advantage when choosing a place for the future deployment of an innovative company - about people who work with residents.  Alexey Stepanenko and his team are the support and support for us, the residents!  For 2 years of our resident, they have become not just our friends, but part of our team!  Thanks to them for their responsiveness, understanding and support. <br><br>  We hope for further prosperity of the SEZ and for the fact that soon all promises made to residents will be fulfilled and this will serve as a pretext for an article describing exclusively the advantages and advantages of residency. <br><br>  PS Historical photos about the creation of the SEZ ( <b>thanks to Klimov Yuri</b> ): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ba8/2ab/583/ba82ab5832bdc0e879907c255ada152b.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05a/590/b41/05a590b41c6701ed68c640de84ac6461.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fab/a26/246/faba2624604b418899412f83c8a15d68.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/a26/af9/c87/a26af9c878dc941c983bfe311967e914.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/181448/">https://habr.com/ru/post/181448/</a></p>
