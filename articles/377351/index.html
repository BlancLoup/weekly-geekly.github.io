  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Domestic projects on Kickstarter / part 6</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, the Scratch World Map is now running on Kickstarter, which is conducting a copyright violation trial, a space RPG, a Battle City game, independent media from the founder Kommersant, a pillow for lovers and a world record in the number of inscriptions on one the beach.  And soon there will be a watch that measures stress, a gadget that combines all discount cards and a mask for comfortable sleep in an airplane. <br><br>  I‚Äôll traditionally tell you about the Kickstarter projects I‚Äôm aware of that are working right now.  It is noteworthy that only one of the six projects has a real chance of a successful completion.  To brighten up the picture, three projects have been added to the selection, which are about to start on Kickstarter and also deserve our attention. <br>  Below I will tell more about each of the projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee0/d8f/cb9/ee0d8fcb98cdc2a9775c5918ea1b9d14.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1831590830/new-media-by-vladimir-yakovlev">New media</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f72/238/51c/f7223851c8304993836443fe7ae91474.png"><br><br>  The project is from the founder of the publishing house ‚ÄúKomersant‚Äù, which has already become the most quickly financed project on Kickstarter in the ‚Äújournalism‚Äù category.  At the same time, New Media is not a crowdfunding, but a charity story.  Indeed, at the moment out of 152 backers, only 57% (87 people) have chosen at least some reward, the rest donate money for free.  And there is nothing more specific in the description of the project than: ‚ÄúI will therefore create media that turns the madmen back into people.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/verge-style/scratchy-map-color-your-world-with-travelling">Sctratchy map</a> </h4><br>  This is a scratch map of the world.  Interestingly, the author of the project Artem Starostenko, this is the fourth project and almost all of the previous ones were successful.  Initially, he was unable to raise funds for the line of leather accessories, then successfully carried out the restart of the project, and last year he very successfully received funding for the line of men's bracelets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dee/f19/333/deef19333d6444da0f62841522aff3cb.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But it is worth noting that the project is temporarily suspended due to copyright proceedings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ba4/df5/ac4/ba4df5ac44bc4d0509e6fa0481a21bb3.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/586060582/connective-pillow-connecting-and-transforming">Connective pillow</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e16/882/ab3/e16882ab35f4464c80522e83960bbc75.png"><br><br>  Connective Pillow - these are two pillows that can be glued together in search of the perfect shape. <br>  The authors of the project position the Connective Pillow as a pillow for two, which will allow you to sleep more comfortably and share your tenderness and warmth.  Actually, these are just two pillows with stickies, one for each, which can be rolled into a strange-looking roll.  In the roll, you can stick your hand, which will allow you to sit comfortably on a pillow together. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/argamedon/hot-armor">Hot armor</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d5/bff/8d8/7d5bff8d805c450488eb43cd249aac14.png"><br><br>  Hot Armor - game from the Ukrainian developer.  According to the author, the project is devoted to events in Ukraine, and in terms of gameplay, the legendary Bomberman and Battle city became sources of inspiration.  The game itself is a tank battles on a fully destructible map with a large assortment of weapons.  The project, of course, is far beyond the well-known World of Tanks, but, for one young developer, it's pretty good.  I saw indie toys and weaker. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1877009925/world-record-for-most-love-declarations-written-on">Sand sign</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fd5/acc/f38/fd5accf3827549fb8c0fe07031845980.png"><br><br>  Sand Sign unites residents of the warm coasts of Thailand and Bali, who are able to make beautiful inscriptions and drawings on the sand.  They can write congratulations on the holiday, a declaration of love, and indeed everything you can think of.  In this case, the guys want to break the world record for the number of inscriptions on the same beach. <br><br><h4>  <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1374663411/nebula-online-an-old-school-hardcore-sci-fi-mmorpg">Nebula Online</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3dc/38b/26b/3dc38b26bcd544b78a80ca3e9bb834e0.png"><br><br>  Nebula Online is an old-game game for real connoisseurs of the topic, in which there will be no subscription fees, free-to-play monetization and an in-game store.  Just buy a game and surf the expanse of space, colonizing new planets.  The game will be released under Mac, PC and Linux, if it receives at least $ 130,000 on Kickstarter (which is unlikely).  The developers themselves describe the project this way: ‚ÄúThe main task for us was to make the game at the junction of two point-click EVE online game mechanics, but with a more dynamic use of the Diablo III combat system.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://emvio.watch/">Emvio</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/059/29f/4eb/05929f4eb913478294261eafcb072ebe.png"><br><br>  This is a watch that shows the level of stress and allows you to adjust it.  The gadget can also measure heart rate, time and physical activity (steps and calories).  The launch of the Kickstarter project is scheduled for March 17th.  More information about the functionality of the clock can be found in <a href="http://geektimes.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%255BEmvio%255D%26target_type%3Dposts">these giktimeopostah</a> . <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://cardberry.com/ru/">Cardberry</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad7/50c/c41/ad750cc4133e029a470606954bbc985f.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Another interesting gadget that is already familiar to habrovchanam.  This is a card that will collect all the discount and affiliate cards.  The guys have already completed a trial series of the gadget and the launch on Kickstarter is scheduled for April.  More information about the gadget at <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%255Bcardberry%255D%26target_type%3Dposts">these sites</a> . <br><br><h4>  <a href="http://sleeper.cc/">Sleeper</a> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59c/052/69a/59c05269a78a470fa09635e964de61d4.jpg"><br><br>  This is a sleep mask that captures the head and allows you to sleep comfortably on long journeys.  It can be used on the plane, bus, train and on the passenger seat of the car.  It looks weird, but in fact, it looks like a really comfortable gizmo that clips the head to the headrest and allows you to get enough sleep while sitting. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br><br>  I want to wish success to those projects that are already running, let them have a second wind.  And for those who are just preparing their project for launch, I hope that my selection of projects will be useful for the analysis. <br><br>  And the latest list of ‚Äúdomestic‚Äù projects on Kickstarter is always available in my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13FYsip4e1yOo4aLgDrdCsJAB6TyNk54_FG8TMKs2GOg/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">google table</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/377351/">https://habr.com/ru/post/377351/</a></p>
