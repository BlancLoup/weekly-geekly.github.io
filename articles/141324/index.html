The service provided by Fixber is cheaper and better than all existing analogues, because it allows you to hire several testers at a reasonable price.  Each tester has a portfolio, and customers can leave feedback on the work done, creating a specialist's reputation.

      A separate story is a search for bugs.  The creators of <b>Fixber</b> say: "whoever <b>finds the</b> bug first, is a prize."  Naturally, there is a monetary reward.  And it‚Äôs guaranteed that more than one person starts to search for a bug, and in the search and elimination of small ‚Äújambs‚Äù before launching, as you know, the number of seekers very much turns into a search quality.  And, as a result, the result. <br><br>  <b>"10" for clarity</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/829/490/d40/829490d40a97c764965a87a4108ef5b2.png" alt="image" align="left">  Startup <a href="http://resumup.com/">Resumup</a> is an application for creating an infographic analogue of a personal resume or job profile.  The creators of the project have relied on the fact that due to the visibility of charts and charts, the information has become much more readable. <br><br>  In the center of the <b>Resumup</b> functional is a horizontal timeline marked with annual serifs.  As for the rest, the division into the headings of the classical resume is preserved: salary expectations (in the not quite familiar form of the hourly rate) knowledge of foreign languages, personal and professional skills, values, hobbies (pretty icons), personality type.  Of particular interest: the definition of the type of personality, for example, a mark on the scale of "extraversion-introversion" or "impulsivity-self-control" with a running slider. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>"10" for prices</b> <br><br><img src="http://bit.ly/HbEgKJ" alt="image" align="left">  Startup <a href="http://www.onlinetours.ru/">OnlineTours</a> is a travel <a href="http://www.onlinetours.ru/">groupon</a> selling packaged tours around the world at very low prices.  Having received investments, the amount of which the founders did not disclose, today <b>OnlineTours is</b> developing faster than all its competitors. <br><br>  <b>"10" for learning</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d94/9c7/9ea/d949c79ea1f43078e35a59464ff94e2e.png" alt="image" align="left">  Startup <a href="http://tutorion.ru/">Tutorion</a> is a platform that organizes and conducts online classes with tutors within the school curriculum, as well as in foreign languages.  <b>Tutorion</b> favorably differs from competitors in the volume of the already attracted audience and in the fact that since the beginning of 2012 it has been a resident of Skolkovo, and this in itself is an excellent recommendation. <br><br>  <b>"10" for the benefit</b> <br><img src="http://bit.ly/HGJMC9" alt="image" align="left">  Startup <a href="http://wallstr.ru/staff/sign_in">Wallster</a> is Groupon for b2b.  The service aggregates the most favorable discount offers for wholesale purchases, supplies and services for business: from office supplies to ordering a business taxi and renting an office.  There <b>are</b> two huge advantages on <b>Wolster‚Äôs</b> side: a very strong team with previous experience in the coupon service and a practically unoccupied niche in the market. <br><br>  <b>"10" for honesty</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d66/733/786/d66733786b0e668b591b04d82eade98a.png" alt="image" align="left">  Startup BotScanner is a tool to determine the number of real unique users of any web resource and the amount of quality traffic.  The most valuable thing in the project is the algorithms that help identify bots and cheating, provide the advertiser with honest data on the number of visitors and adequately plan the advertising campaign. <br><br>  <b>"10" for collective funding</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad7/192/68e/ad719268ea82f0e63c48accbfe33ff59.jpg" alt="image" align="left">  <a href="http://bit.ly/HLIl2r">StartApp</a> is a platform for finding investments and co-investors in mobile applications.  The startup works at the intersection of two megapopular trends today: mobile technology and crowdsourcing.  By registering, any project-idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa mobile application can begin to search for investments, and several community members can invest in the idea in order to share sales with the creator in the AppStore.  The project is fully focused on the Western market. <br><br>  <b>"10" for the salvation of his wife</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/0f9/35d/05a/0f935d05abb9e5a6afbb55dee1c0a3d6.png" alt="image" align="left">  Start-up iPhone application developer SmartProgramPhones launches its first product, <b><a href="http://www.rock-a-round.com/">Rock-a-round,</a></b> to the market.  The plot of the game is not devoid of drama: while a funny primeval man named Barrek was on the hunt, his wife was stolen.  They stole and hid in a cave, and the entrance was filled up with stones.  And now the task of Barrek - to save his beloved in 90 seconds.  On the side of the positive sales forecasts in the AppStore - intuitive gameplay. <br><br>  <b>"10" for being user friendly</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/84b/b4b/333/84bb4b3335af88a7c10823b8652e4fa0.png" alt="image" align="left">  <a href="http://wheely.com/">Wheely</a> is a startup mobile application for ordering a taxi.  Maximum customization of the service allows the user to mark his house, destination, his favorite places on the map, to make a route in advance.  You can order a taxi in advance, specifying the time of arrival of the car, so that later it is not distracted. <br><br>  <b>"10" for fitting</b> <br><br><img src="http://bit.ly/HhumW9" alt="image" align="left">  <a href="http://fittingreality.com/">Fitting Reality</a> is a project of virtual VIP VIP fitting room that works in the popular trend of remote clothing selection based on augmented reality technology.  Using the sensor, the system scans the human body and automatically determines its physical parameters (ShapeID). <br><br>  After analyzing the data and determining the type of figure, the program begins to recommend to the user only those clothes that will fit his unique figure.  Any thing you like you can virtually try on yourself and look at its three-dimensional copy from different sides.  A unique element of the project is the technology of measuring the parameters of the human body with the help of the Microsoft Kinect sensor: clothes are tried on not a real avatar, but on a real person. <br><br>  We would be very grateful for project feedback.  Did you find these projects worthy of being named the best in March? <br><br>  There will be a new month and new interesting startups, so as not to miss them, subscribe to our blog. <br>  And if you want us to write about your project, <a href="http://bit.ly/HVB9Ew">add it to StartupPoint.ru</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141324/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141324/</a></p>
