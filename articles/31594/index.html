    <h4>  SSO Adapter service </h4>  - In order to receive data from third-party servers whose servers are not integrated into the AccessManager, the Portal Server uses the SSO Adapter service.  Services accessed through the SSO Adapter can provide mail, scheduling, address books, etc. <br><br><h3>  Portal Server Desktop </h3><br>  The portal server aggregates and displays information to the user.  What the user sees in the browser is called Standard Desktop (standard desktop). <br>  In addition to the standard desktop, there is Mobile Desktop (mobile desktop) and Voice Desktop (voice desktop). <br><br>  A standard desktop is a web page, the contents of which are located in rows and columns.  The portal server uses two ways to send content to the desktop: <br><br><h4>  Channels </h4>  (channels) - a special area for content, which is a small window on a web page.  The channel consists of: <br>  ‚Ä¢ Provider object (provider) <br>  ‚Ä¢ Configuration files <br>  ‚Ä¢ Data files (data files): XML, HTML templates that can be processed by the channel <br>  For example: <br>  News channel - displays links to news. <br>  Mail channel - displays emails sent to users <br><br><h4>  Container channels </h4>  (Channel Container) - aggregates the channels.  The portal server supports AJAXTableContainerProvider, which allows asynchronous downloading of channel content, provides drag'n'drop functionality. <br>  For example: <br>  Table container (Table Container) - Arranges channels in rows and columns. <br>  Tab container (tabs container) - Allocates channels (most often table containers) to tabs. <br><br>  Supported channel types: <br>  The portal server supports the following channel types: <br>  <strong>Standard Java portlets</strong> (Standard Java portlets) that use the Portlet 1.0 standard defined in JSR 168. <br>  Providers that use proprietary interfaces: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <strong>JSP providers</strong> to compile and run JSP pages <br>  ‚Ä¢ <strong>XML providers</strong> for translating XML files <br>  ‚Ä¢ <strong>Remote portlets</strong> (Remote portlets), which use the Web <em>Services for Remote Portlets</em> (Web <em>Services for Remote Portlets</em> ) WSRP 1.0 standard, is a special protocol for web services used to integrate portlets (special JSR 168) located on remote resources. <br><br><h3>  Portal Server Community Roles </h3><br>  (Roles of users of community services running on the portal server) <br>  There are three types of roles: <br>  <strong>Owner</strong> (Community Owner), <strong>Member</strong> (Community Member), <strong>Visitor</strong> (Visitor). <br>  A community owner can create and delete a community, distribute membership, and also deprive users of their rights to access the community.  Can carry out any operations with content (creating articles, uploading files, deleting, etc.). <br>  A community member can take part in community activities (polls, discussions), create content, see other community members, general information about the community. <br>  The visitor is deprived of all basic rights, can view the content created in the community <br><br><h3>  Services for community users: </h3><br><h4>  Wiki </h4>  - The Wiki container and the corresponding portlets allow the community to work with an interactive site that hosts community content.  Community members can create new and modify existing content (pages, files). <br>  ‚Ä¢ Discussions - Community discussions are a mechanism for sharing information within the community.  There is a subscription mechanism, information retrieval. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Blogs - A blog portlet allows community members to run a web blog. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Surveys and Polls - Members can take part in surveys and surveys.  Format of questions: yes / no, answers by choice, free form. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Searches (Search) - Community members can search by community, portal. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Events and Tasks - Community members can use scheduling implemented using the SunTM Calendar Server software to create, edit, and respond to events and tasks for community projects. <br>  ‚Ä¢ File Sharing (File Sharing) - Members of the community 8566a can share files: create folders, upload and download documents, any other type of information. <br><br><h3>  Portal Server Search Server Robot </h3><br>  (portal server search robot) <br>  The search robot searches, converts and organizes the resources available to portal users. <br>  Search robot functionality: <br>  Extract links to resources and navigate through them (entry in the registry) <br>  Formal description of found resources <br>  Writing resource descriptions to the database (indexing) <br><br>  You can customize the behavior of the search robot using the following actions: <br>  Setting the timetable <br>  Definition of meta search resources <br>  Setting the depth of resource search <br>  An indication of the types of resources that the robot is looking for. <br><h3>  AJAXTableContainerProvider </h3><br>  <strong>Literature</strong> : <br><h5>  Java SystemPortal Server 7.1 Update 1 AJAX Table Container.pdf </h5><br><br>  The provider integrates Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) capabilities into the portal framework.  The container provides the ability to asynchronously download individual channels and portlets on the portal page.  For example, on the page there are three fast channels and one slow.  The container will load the first three channels, and the user will be able to start work without waiting for the full load of the contents of the web page. <br>  Container features <br>  ‚Ä¢ Positioning channels and individual portlets by dragging <br>  ‚Ä¢ Asynchronous interaction by events: collapsing and expanding the channel, deleting the channel from the user page. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Independent update of individual channels, portlets without reloading the entire page. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Editing portlets without reloading the entire page. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Quick and easy add and delete channels. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Customizable appearance of the portal page. <br>  Limitations of AJAXTableContainerProvider <br>  ‚Ä¢ User browsers must have JavaScript enabled. <br>  ‚Ä¢ The container does not automatically add functionality to the AJAX component.  The developer must write the appropriate code in order to use the capabilities of the AJAX container. <br>  ‚Ä¢ By default, the edit mode of channels and portlets is hidden from the user.  The fact is that in an AJAX container the width of the window in the edit mode is smaller, in the similar mode <br>  ‚Ä¢ In another container. <br>  ‚Ä¢ On the portal page you can place only one AJAX container. <br><br>  <strong>Conclusion:</strong> <br>  And so, finally, the portal 7.1 is substantially closer to the existing standard of the portal of all times and peoples, to the portal of the WebSphere. <br>  I want to remind you that IBM is an extremely conservative company.  Now there is an active migration from portals 5.0 to portals 5.1. On Java 5.0 portals, Java 1.3 runs, on portals 5.1 - Java 1.4, and only on portal 6.1 Java 1.5 appeared <br>  And on the Sana portal you can write under 1.6. <br>  In the 6.1 version of WebSphere there is an analogue of AJAXTableContainerProvider, when the portlets are overloaded and react to events independently of each other, while reloading the page is not required. <br>  Unfortunately, 7.1 works only with JSR-168, and IBM portals, in addition to their specification, support the JSR-168 specification. <br>  Currently available is the Sanovsky portal 7.2, which holds both the 168th and 286 specifications.  By the way, IBM approved the specification 286, so it is worth expecting that the company's portals will also work with the native Sanovsky specification. <br>  Together with the IBM portal, you can put WCM-Web Content Manager, this is a kind of CMS in the interpretation of IBM.  If interested, I can tell you what is its originality.  When I had to work with WCM, I was extremely surprised by its architecture, I had never seen anything like it before.  WCM 2.0 sat on portal 5.0, and WCM 5.1 sat on portal 5.1 <br>  The guys decided to synchronize the version of the portal and content manager.  In addition to versions, WCM has undergone more significant changes, but about this some other time. <br>  in addition to CMS'ok for portals, IBM has exactly the same SSO technology.  By the way, because of it, interesting glitches occurred on portal 5.0 (WebSphere Portal Server) and application server 5.0 (WebSphere Application Server): <br>  Suppose you are logged in under the same user from the same browser to the portal, and then to the application server admin console.  When debugging an application, this need often arises. <br>  After entering the admin console, your session on the portal is forcibly killed.  You make changes on the application server (for example, you restart the web service your portlet goes to), switch to the tab with the portal in the browser, and discover that your session is no longer valid. <br>  You re-authorize on the portal, test your portlet, go back to the browser tab with the admin console and find out that the session on the admin console is dead.  By logging in to the admin console, you are killing the session on the portal. <br>  Here is such a strange joint with the general user session on the portal and application server of this portal. <br><br>  In general, portal 7.1 is not much inferior to IBM portals.  The main thing is for JSR-286 to get support, start living, then IBM may have a serious competitor in the field of portal technologies. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/31594/">https://habr.com/ru/post/31594/</a></p>
