  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Scalable solutions for EMV and mobile NFC payments in closed networks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Chip payment cards that use the modern EMV standard, supported by such giants as Europay, MasterCard, VISA, American Express and JCB, are gradually making their way into the wallets of our fellow citizens.  However, companies, as is often the case, face the question of using the most effective solution to introduce a new technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1b/c23/d5c/d1bc23d5c7e646fead0ebfd0871b4ab5.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In order to help companies start using these cards, Gemalto has developed PURE, a platform for launching projects using a white label scheme (under its own brand), which provides card issuers and mobile payment system operators the opportunity to work with EMV. <br><br>  PURE products have been certified by EMV Co., which guarantees a high level of security, even more complete compatibility and reduced costs of fraudulent transactions through the use of microprocessor-based cards with PIN-code authorization.  At the same time, no additional investments are required in creating your own payment system specifications or in your own certification processes.

      The PURE platform supports any EMV-compatible terminals and internal systems (POS or ATM), which allows minimizing the dependence on infrastructure and achieving the highest possible cost-effectiveness and ease of deployment. <br><br>  PURE also integrates the ability to make NFC payments, which may be especially relevant against the background of the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/gemaltorussia/blog/306844/">growing popularity of this technology</a> .  Mobile PURE platform for mobile NFC payments based on secure elements (SIM and embedded elements) or HCE, is already available for mobile payment system operators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/440/101/499/4401014990834e4b9fb8542beb7bfca7.png"><br><br><h2>  PURE Products, Solutions and Services </h2><br>  Despite the comparative novelty of the EMV specification, PURE solutions have already established themselves and at the moment more than 60 million PURE cards are used in the world. <br>  What features distinguish these solutions and allow issuers to quickly deploy the necessary systems, as well as speed up the launch of their products on the market?  Among the features of the platform are the following: <br><br><ul><li>  The ability to work with contact and proximity cards PURE </li><li>  New form factors (stickers and wearable devices) </li><li>  Mobile application that works with embedded secure elements (SIM, HCE) </li><li>  Personalization Services </li><li>  Manage Tokens and Mobile Payment Platform </li><li>  Card Making Solutions </li><li>  Consulting services from EMV experts </li></ul><br><h2>  Rich set of functions and applications </h2><br>  At the technical level, PURE offers developers a wide range of supported specifications and options: <br><br><ul><li>  Support for various card operating systems (Java, MULTOS and proprietary OS) </li><li>  SDA, DDA, and CDA </li><li>  Combined PURE card with PURE application and support for one of the international schemes based on a single microprocessor platform </li><li>  The ability to store data to account for accumulated points or confirm the purchase of a ticket in transport applications </li><li>  The amount of user memory from 8 to 72Kb </li><li>  MIFARE and DESfire emulation cards are available. </li><li>  Compatibility with Common Personalization Standards (CPS) </li><li>  Support for various cardholder verification methods (CVM): with online and offline PIN entry, signature, mobile CVM, verification using biometrics on the card (fingerprint scanning) </li><li>  Compatible with mobile NFC technology (using SIM, HCE or embedded secure element) </li></ul><br><h2>  Spheres of application </h2><br>  Issuers of city transport cards and social discount cards offer more convenient service. <br>  The use of PURE smart cards together with flexible solutions for their manufacture allows implementing new usage scenarios: <br><br><ul><li>  refusal of cash payments and acceleration of payment in urban transport </li><li>  multifunctional city cards for payment of various services, transportation, and access control in a ‚Äúsmart‚Äù city </li><li>  government programs and initiatives aimed at increasing the availability of financial services or creating electronic services using maps or mobile applications </li></ul><br>  Retailers and gas station networks expand the functionality of loyalty cards and fuel cards of their own brands <br><br>  The PURE platform provides banking-level security, which helps reduce fraud through the use of microprocessor-based cards with PIN authorization and mobile NFC applications.  In addition to a high level of security, the PURE platform provides additional convenience to contactless technology, and also supports many other features that increase loyalty and increase conversion rates and allow for more efficient customer retention programs.  Moreover, thanks to the support of EMV standards, the card can also be used in partner networks, for example, in retail, parking and hotels, which will provide additional support for your marketing initiatives. <br><br><h2>  PURE solutions in action </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b4/361/798/1b4361798e43403fadb62b63c74531b2.jpg"><br><br>  In 52 countries of the world, more than 150 PURE-based projects have been implemented, including in Russia - for example, the Gazpromneft network of petrol stations, which has about 1,400 stations in Russia and the CIS, just recently upgraded its loyalty card by introducing a contactless solution to increase usability and level of security.  Along with the basic functions, the introduction of contactless technology has allowed up to 10 times the speed of service at the checkout. <br><br>  In this implementation, Gemalto Optelio PURE dual interface EMV cards are used, the project is implemented according to the white label scheme.  New contactless cards are serviced with the help of modern Ingenico POS-terminals and are supported in the back-office systems of the Gazpromneft gas station network supplied by OpenWay. <br><br>  More than 7 million customers of the network use loyalty cards ‚ÄúWe are on the way‚Äù today.  The introduction of new maps is carried out since the beginning of 2016 and provides a clear plan for the deployment of advanced functionality with the ability to realize additional benefits for users. <br><br>  As expected, the new cards are fully compatible with the EMV standard for bank cards and are accepted on the company's own terminal network.  At the same time, Gazpromneft retains full control over the implementation of this project. <br><br>  The introduction of contactless cards and terminals was an important step forward in terms of increasing service speed, increasing convenience and reliability of service.  Along with this introduction, the company actually laid the foundation for the implementation of mobile payments, and now it will be able to provide support for this service for the fast-growing generation of consumers who actively use smartphones. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308742/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308742/</a></p>
