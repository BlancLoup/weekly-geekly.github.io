Today we want to tell you about the funny desktop that was born in our company.  Please do not take everything too seriously and do not look for logic where it does not belong. <br><br>  Our colleagues, like most IT people, play a variety of a variety of board (and table) games - from Magic: The Gathering to Munchkin and Mafia.  The latter enjoys a special love, mafiosi regularly gather in almost all DataArt offices.  That is why we decided to adapt it for IT realities.  And thanks to Kolya Kharitonov from the Voronezh office, our company has its own command and role-playing game!

Instead, players will have to reincarnate as developers, testers and even HR and give battle to malicious ‚Äúbugs‚Äù.  The role of bugs, it is worth noting, also goes to people.  If you always wanted to feel like an elusive error in the program code - ‚ÄúBagfix‚Äù allows it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebf/c07/999/ebfc079997f5415f9ad64c94e4f41331.png"><br><br>  As in the classic "Mafia", the game is divided into "day" and "night" phases.  During the day, the whole team is looking for bugs, and bugs, of course, hide and pretend that they are looking for themselves.  At the end of the ‚Äúday‚Äù, according to the results of the vote, the code of one of the team members is joyfully cut out (which forces this participant to leave the project), and the rest will have to go through the night, <s>which is dark and full of horrors</s> . <br><br>  It is at night in the game that special server magic is familiar to our brother's IT friend. <br>  The bugs in some unthinkable way spoil the seemingly unrelated code. <br>  The technical leader, devoured by the sharpest dissonance due to the inconsistency of the code with his own sense of beauty, after numerous attempts to sleep, still does not stand up, goes to the computer and is taken for refactoring. <br>  The tester, who suddenly remembered that he forgot to test something, also decides to look for bugs in him only in the back streets of the project. <br>  HR, suddenly catching a promising candidate, immediately drags the developer, under the hot hand, to interview his find.  And even the travel manager cannot fall asleep without planning a sudden departure for someone on a business trip or vacation. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/40c/6ef/1f7/40c6ef1f741f496ba82076ff4e84067b.png"><br><br>  Stressful nights alternate with equally busy days, the team gets rid of bugs, losing people ... And so - either until the project is cleaned out completely, or until the amount of bugs and entropy going through the roof makes the further development of the project impossible. <br><br>  Companies of nastolk lovers have the most varied numbers, so we balanced the rules in such a way that with almost any composition the game will turn out to be tense, exciting and interesting.  The fine line between psychologism and logic, between skill and chance and all the other, familiar to the Mafia connoisseurs, are very carefully kept in Bugfix, transferring the good old board role-playing game to the painfully familiar and familiar world of IT. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/aa8/a05/f37/aa8a05f3762d44619b3c50b434c9495c.png"><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">rules</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h6>  Introduction </h6><br>  Bugfix is ‚Äã‚Äãa team role-playing game created by colleagues from DataArt, based on Mafia.  It uses and develops logic, intuition, memory, theatricality, non-verbal communication, teamwork;  besides, it's endlessly fun. <br><br><h6>  Course of the game </h6><br><br>  Before the start of the game, the leader in the closed hands over to the players one card each with the notation for playing roles.  Each player watches his card without showing it to the others, and remembers his role.  After that, it is recommended to put the card face down in front of you so that it can be clearly seen by the leader and players;  after the "death" card is better to pass the lead.  In the course of the game, this will remove the massive question ‚Äúwho is alive?‚Äù From the agenda.  Other players should under no circumstances see the value of the card.  Accidental disclosure of the card leads either to an instant "death" of the player, or to a restart of the game (especially with a small number of players).  After the change, the alternation of the day and night phases of the game begins: during the day, all actions and discussions are performed openly, at night all actions provided for by the game roles are performed secretly and as quietly as possible.  This is accomplished by asking all players to close their eyes (preferably with a hand, mask, or any other obvious and noticeable method), and then the leader alternately ‚Äúwakes up‚Äù players with the right roles, who silently make their choice, for example, pointing to the target with a finger.  The alternation of day and night continues until one of the conditions for victory is achieved. <br><br><h6>  Roles </h6><br><br>  Players are divided into an unorganized majority (conditionally good, also called red) and an organized minority (conditionally bad, or black) <br><ul><li>  Bug - black player.  Pretends to be a Developer during the day (however, he can be called any other role at his own discretion), at night, in conjunction with other Bugs, chooses one of the red players he intends to eliminate from the game </li><li>  The developer is the main non-status red player, the main instruments of influence on the game are the voice on daytime votes, insight and eloquence </li><li>  A tester is a red player waking up in his phase of the night and checking the status of one of the players.  Reliable information about whether a bug is checked, only he will receive;  convincing the others is his business. </li><li>  Travel manager is a neutral player waking up in his phase of the night and sending any player on a long-term business trip.  The next morning, if the selected player was not saved by Timlid or HR, he leaves the project. </li><li>  Timlid is a red player waking up in his phase of the night and arranging code review for one of the players.  As a result, it eliminates the influence of Bugs (saving the player from dropping out of the project if Bugs tried to eliminate this particular player from the project this night) and neutralizes the Travel-manager (initiating refactoring and thus prohibiting business trips) </li><li>  HR is a red player who wakes up in his phase of the night and attracts any player to conduct interviews.  Attracted during the interview, it blocks its part of the repository, thus saving itself from the influence of the Bugs;  besides, this player obviously cannot be sent on a business trip that night. </li></ul><br><br><h6>  First night </h6><br><br>  On the first night, no game action takes place: the leader simply wakes up all the characters one by one to find out who they are.  Bugs wake up all at once and silently get acquainted. <br>  Day <br>  Players through civilized discussions (sometimes turning into loud squabbles) are trying to establish who among them is a bug, and remove it from the project.  Black players obviously pretend to be red and try to influence the players' opinion in order to shield themselves and slander someone from the red.  In the course goes all the available information: who was killed and in what order;  who as voted in previous moves;  who were killed (if the game rules provide for the disclosure of this information);  who behaves like himself, who supports whom, who supports whom, who is uncharacteristically talkative, who, on the contrary, keeps silent, etc.  After a general discussion, the moderator announces the vote, the victim is elected by simple majority.  In case of equality of the maximum number, there are variations: not to kill anyone, to kill both, to re-discuss and re-vote.  After the player dies (night and day), depending on the variation of the game, the card can be opened unconditionally, remain closed or the choice can be given to the killed player. <br><br><h6>  Standard night </h6><br><br>  The leader alternately ‚Äúwakes up‚Äù players with a certain role, recognizes the objects of their game actions (for example, the acting character can point at players with a finger) and silently gives out game information, if provided for by the role. <br>  If the game variation does not provide for the disclosure of the roles of the dead, the leader continues to "idle" to announce the moves of the killed players. <br>  First, the bugs wake up at the command of the lead, silently consult and jointly select a player who is going to be eliminated from the project.  Having made a choice, they fall asleep. <br>  Then the Travel manager wakes up and chooses who he intends to eliminate from the project.  Having made a choice, he falls asleep. <br>  Next Timlid wakes up and chooses a player who is satisfied with code review.  If he chooses the same player as the Bugs and / or Travel manager, this player is considered saved.  If both the Bugs and the Travel manager attempted on this player, he is still considered saved from both types of attacks.  Having made a choice, Timlid falls asleep. <br>  Following this, the Tester wakes up and chooses a player to be tested, after which he looks inquiringly at the leader.  If a Bug is selected, the presenter nods his head - ‚Äúthis is a bug, yes‚Äù, if the Travel manager is selected or the red player, the presenter shakes his head - ‚Äúno‚Äù.  After receiving the answer, the tester falls asleep. <br>  HR wakes up last.  He chooses a player and draws him to the interview.  If he chooses the same player as Bugs and / or Timlid, this player is considered to be saved, by analogy with Timlid.  However, if the target of the attack is HR itself and he was not rescued by Timlid, both of them are leaving the project: both HR and the player who is involved in the interview.  Having made a choice, HR falls asleep. <br>  After that, the host wakes up all the players, announces the results of the night and initiates a day discussion.  Players are forbidden to speak up before the announcement of the lead, who left the project (if, for example, the retired Tester has time to issue the found Bug, it will not be good). <br>  Victory conditions <br><br>  The victory of the Reds is announced when all the Bugs and Travel manager have been removed from the project.  There are no bugs, business trips do not threaten, and this means that the project is saved. <br><br>  Black's victory is declared when the number of Bugs becomes equal to or exceeds the number of all other players (red and neutral). <br>  Victory Travel manager is announced if there is no one left in the project.  Business trips, yes ... I will send everyone, I will stay alone! <br><br><h6>  Recommendations on the composition </h6><br><br>  The minimum number of players is seven, plus the leader (you can do without a dedicated leader: Bugs to acquaint each other with the blind teams who have killed the player on the first day as the lead).  Maximum - 12-13 people, for large companies you need to finalize the composition of roles. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e16/965/822/e169658223e646b4b0391b2eeeded524.png"><br><br>  The leader can change the composition of the players, guided by considerations of the balance of the game. <br></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Card layouts</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Customize to a convenient size, print, play! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/725/196/f52/725196f52c734710bc7e34b1e9ead4b4.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/52f/e28/76a/52fe2876a309493b8c88709b6dcf180c.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e5d/ee7/83a/e5dee783a8a048c1876ed0516d319021.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e20/2ab/dd9/e202abdd9fb04672acdce9010d26ab7d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/035/7de/e5f/0357dee5f2ba468eaf00393f514de187.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ee/db9/725/1eedb9725dfa49cab8b52efaa8e79372.jpg"><br></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374961/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374961/</a></p>
