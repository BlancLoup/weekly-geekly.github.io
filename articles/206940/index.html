There is such a thing - <b>post</b> - <b>sales shock</b> .  This is when a person bought something, gave the money, got the thing in his hands ... and starts frantically thinking why he did it. <br><br>  In large cities, where shopping is developed, it is not as relevant as in the regions (where there are also slightly less wages).  Therefore, we have one recommended mechanic that helps to remove this shock. <br><br>  I'll tell you now. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Where does this feeling come from after purchase? </h4><br>  Seriously - I do not know.  But what is known: <br><ul><li>  <b>The more thoughtful the purchase - the less strange emotions</b> .  Consciously selected laptop, for which you were sitting with a friend, causes far less such sensations than a similar laptop is 1000 rubles more expensive, bought because the first one was not available. </li><li>  <b>The more expensive the product - the higher the shock</b> .  Fears are added that it does not work as it should, that it is not worth its money, and so on. </li><li>  <b>The less information about the product - the worse</b> .  If the seller told everything and gave a hold-try - it is much better than buying from an online store. </li><li>  <b>The greater the buyer's experience in acquiring different pieces - the less shock</b> .  For example, we have a strikingly different resident in Moscow who buys the game that he already has at home (simply because he needs to visit and visit the house for a long time), and a resident of a remote region who is awaiting the sending of Russian mail for the holidays. </li><li>  <b>The older the buyer, the stronger the emotions</b> .  Perhaps you have seen how grandmothers are very worried after buying a new skillet, for example.  There is still an important point - as a rule, retirees do not have immunity to ‚Äúvparivanie‚Äù, so sometimes they buy completely unnecessary things, and realize this only the next day.  And, by the way, that‚Äôs why we once mentioned in our franchise in our time, that in communication between the seller and the pensioner, you should always leave a ‚Äúwalkway‚Äù for him or you should carefully make sure that the gift is exactly suitable for his grandson, for example.  Here, a couple of extra rubles is absolutely not worth good karma and reputation. </li></ul><br><h4>  How does a person cope on his own? </h4><br>  If the purchase is expensive - he begins to convince himself that he did everything right.  For example, with increased attention reads advertisements in magazines (especially so they do after buying a car).  Climbs to the site with the goods and re-reads the description in detail.  Carefully reads the reviews and enjoys positive.  He tells about the product to relatives and friends (and so calms down).  Just go to bed to wake up in the morning without worry.  In general, at first he agrees with himself, then he lives in a new picture of the world. <br><br><h4>  What are we doing? </h4><br>  We have a rather complicated product: board games.  Everyone likes them, but first you need to understand the rules.  There is such a problem that a person can simply not begin to understand in a difficult game, waiting for someone to help him. <br><br>  The second point is that we must constantly keep abreast of how good the goods are, how well the sellers advise, and generally be aware of what our customers think. <br><br>  Here is what we do in general: <br><ol><li>  <b>On the site we give a detailed description of the goods</b> , necessarily - with the component composition and photos of everything inside the box.  This makes it possible to very accurately know what is being bought. </li><li>  <b>In the store, we must give the person to touch the goods before buying</b> .  Any box can be opened, play directly with the seller, then buy.  In Moscow, there is still a free rental of games, when the box can be taken home to study for two weeks (as a deposit), then return and receive a deposit back. </li><li>  <b>No questions accept returns</b> .  "The game did not fit the wallpaper" and any other reasons within a week or two (depending on the point of purchase and method) - this is absolutely ok.  Open games are not written off in our country, but transferred to a game fund, or donated to charity programs in orphanages, by the way. </li><li>  <b>In stores we hang up the main telephone in the region</b> .  On the site we give mail to everyone, including the founders.  The very possibility of a direct connection gives rise to trust. </li><li>  <b>We try to prescribe in detail what is happening with the order</b> .  This is very important, because if there is a gap between the transfer of money and the receipt, the person perceives it painfully.  The most serious case is sending by prepaid mail, there is such a gap from three days to three months.  Therefore, we taught the robot to inform the buyer about the order status, plus supplied it with a set of instructions.  In particular, he promptly gives advice on when it is better to just call the mail to check that the package is there - and not still have to wait for the notification.  Plus, when the tracking number appears, the operator sends it to the buyer, and the robot reminds you how to follow the order with this data.  By the way, while there is an unresolved problem with bank transfers: if you live in the region and send a transfer on the Sberbank receipt, we will see it only after 3 working days - plus another lag to synchronize data with the order base - and now there is a place for panic.  The person thinks that the money comes at the moment when he gives it through the window - and he begins to worry. </li></ol><br>  And finally, sometimes we make a post-sale call. <br><br><h4>  Call after sale </h4><br>  This is probably the most difficult for perception, but at the time of this call you do not have the task to sell or advertise something.  At all.  Other tasks are to understand if a person doesn‚Äôt need to make a return (and he‚Äôs shy to say) whether everything is in order with the sale, whether any bugs were revealed during the transaction process, plus help with the rules whenever possible and, rarely, tell about the little-known useful options. <br><br>  The call begins with the operator introducing himself and asking if it is convenient to talk.  If convenient - specifies whether you liked the game, and whether they have already played.  If there are signs of dissatisfaction or uncertainty, it tells about trouble-free returns and suggests our nearest point.  It then checks if the rules need help.  If you need to - you can either immediately say something on the phone, or give a tip to the nearest game store, where the animator will help you figure it out.  It happens that a person simply cannot find a company to test a game - also a tip on a game store.  Further, during a conversation, a person can tell about something that he didn‚Äôt like: the operator will clarify the details and transfer the data to the manager, so that this will somehow change the processes. <br><br>  Occasionally, the operator talks about discounts, but only after the person asks or becomes interested.  Sometimes they immediately ask about additions.  But I repeat - this is far from the main task. <br><br>  Until the last moment, the person at the other end of the line does not believe that now they will not begin to tell him about any stock or sell something.  When the operator finishes making sure that everything is in order, and simply says ‚Äúgoodbye‚Äù - this is a little surprising (we were called back several times to tell it).  This is the most wonderful moment.  A person with trepidation is waiting for advertising and vparivaniya - and suddenly realizes that no, they called him simply because they wanted to help (but, of course, we earn from it, because we almost never leave dissatisfied customers). <br><br>  <b>Why do we do that?</b>  Because it helps a lot in keeping customers.  We learned this from merchants in small towns.  There, every seller knows all the people in the area, greets them, talks, asks about things, wonders if everything is alright with his goods, helps.  Yes, he may lose some money on return - but if you compare 5 years of profit from a person from a nearby street with one deal, the choice is obvious.  Such a seller is believed and continues to go to him, even if a similar store opens across the street.  Plus it has excellent feedback that allows you to grow quickly. <br><br>  <b>Who are we calling?</b>  It depends.  In some regions, sellers call everyone every other day (for example, in Donetsk, and it‚Äôs the seller who spoke in the store with the buyer there).  Somewhere - selectively in three or four days, depending on the type of order.  In Moscow, we do control checks on a small percentage of total orders - there is almost no post-sale shock, but we need feedback and control of our processes. <br><br>  Is the mechanic honed?  Not until the end, there is much to develop.  But we felt the most important thing - the absence of any attempt to sell at the time of circulation. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/206940/">https://habr.com/ru/post/206940/</a></p>
