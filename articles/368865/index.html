The logic is clear, why make messengers based on open protocols, so you can not bind users to yourself.  Such projects can exist only within the framework of the Open Source community and good initiative. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff6/25c/405/ff625c405596437abe13a93bb1250025.jpg" alt="Mr. Whoer"></div><br><br>  One of the employees of our company ( <a href="https://whoer.net/">whoer.net)</a> proposed to make his fork Psi + and headed the project, why we needed it and what we did, under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      PSI + is a completely independent client, based on the well-known PSI, which develops within the framework of the existing team and their vision of a convenient messenger.  Some things in it seemed to us not very comfortable and we understand that it‚Äôs not right and counterproductive to demand something from the developers to remake to our taste.  Therefore, we contacted the development team and worked together with them for several months, working on our own client version, which we would like to present to you and propose for use.  This is the GNU GPL open source product, and there will be no commerce.  This is the first build, pre-alpha of what we would like to do.  Work on the client will continue and it will improve until there is an understanding that there is nothing more to improve.  Why do you need it?  Many of us use jabber-clients for business and personal correspondence, we each have hundreds of contacts and we wanted to improve the lives of ourselves and society.  We do not like that there are dozens of different messengers, where everyone pulls a blanket over himself, annoyed by the need to switch between skype, hangout, vibeers, ICQ and telegrams.  We would like to see a single open source XMPP protocol and various convenient clients for it, for taste and color. <br><br>  Now about what has been done so far. <br><br>  1) Strongly reworked work with history, it is now really convenient to use it: <br><br>  - convenient search through the entire contact history <br>  - found messages are shown in the context of the story, and not a set of individual replicas <br>  - Increased the number of messages per page history, now you need to turn over the pages much less <br><br>  As it was: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a0d/e82/9a2/a0de829a2e6d4fb2abff2f53bb5b4eb6.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As it became: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d93/7ba/9ad/d937ba9add414b91ba955af4e1933758.png" alt="image"><br><br>  2) Redesigned the settings menu, something not very important was removed in the advanced settings, something more important moved from the advanced settings to the general menu.  In general, it became more comfortable here.  In our opinion. <br><br>  3) Changed the pop-up menu, by pressing the right mouse button, in the field of the contact list and in the chat field.  Expanded its functionality.  Now often used actions will be performed much faster. <br><br>  As it was: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d7/7c1/065/6d77c1065afe4f72b93184cd586f6905.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As it became: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eaf/a25/8c6/eafa258c673947cfa7afa180cffea0d2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  4) Since  we have a resource about security and anonymity, and the main guarantee of anonymity is the ability not to stand out.  At the start, quite a few people will use the program and the name of the client (this information that any of your interlocutors can see) will sharply distinguish you from the crowd.  In the client, in the advanced settings, there is the possibility of masking under the most popular Jabber clients, by default we installed the PSI client. <br><br>  5) All open tabs, until the client closes, also open after restarting it, it is just convenient. <br><br>  6) Now all messages (including technical ones, such as a request for authorization) associated with a contact from your contact list are displayed in the chat window, previously these were separate pop-up windows with technical information. <br><br>  7) Made a completely portable client build. <br><br>  8) Removed constantly appearing window, with an annoying suggestion to enter information about yourself.  If a person did not introduce it, it means he didn‚Äôt want, why should he remind about it? <br><br>  9) Improved search by contact list. <br><br>  - the search menu is called by pressing the F3 key <br>  - the search filter is not reset after clicking on one of the filtered contacts <br><br>  10) Eliminated the error arising from the launch of 2 clients simultaneously. <br><br>  11) Recycled and significantly improved the work of multi-line tabs. <br><br>  - added the ability to rigidly attach tabs chat, by analogy with the attached tabs in the browser.  This can be useful when you need to remember to talk with the person when he appears online. <br>  - the active chat table is highlighted more brightly - it is convenient when you have a lot of chats open. <br>  - open tabs can now be swapped <br><br>  <b>Attachment of tobacco</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a89/d9a/fc6/a89d9afc65a54e078150dd01f8b30708.png" alt="image"><br><br>  12) In taba, when communicating with your contact, you now see the name of the current group in which it is located.  This is convenient when you have many contacts and dozens of ‚ÄúIvanovs‚Äù, with whom confusion sometimes arose. <br><br>  13) When you change your status, the annoying window no longer appears asking you to describe your status. <br><br>  14) The ability to copy part of the selected URL in incoming messages, and not just the entire URL as it was before <br><br>  15) When you open a chat with a contact, you are immediately shown the last 5 messages (this can be changed in the settings) with it, so that you can immediately find out what you communicated with him earlier. <br><br>  <b>OTR</b> <br><br>  16) Now certificates are automatically generated out of the box. <br><br>  17) OTR is turned on automatically for any chat, if possible by another interlocutor to use it (adjusted in the settings). <br><br>  <b>Phishing Protection</b> <br><br>  18) Added a warning when starting a dialogue with another contact, if that contact uses non-Latin characters in their Jabber ID. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6f6/c8e/97b/6f6c8e97bf564b578d0692f6158ee84d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As well as many small, technical and graphic corrections that were found in the process of working on the product, which prevented the IM messenger from living and using normally. <br><br>  <b>In the near future:</b> <br><br>  1) Improve the work with OTP, check the status of the interlocutor and do not send encrypted messages offline, ask the user what to send encrypted impossible, whether to send the usual. <br><br>  2) Make support and work through TOR out of the box <br><br>  3) Speed ‚Äã‚Äãup the work of history, refuse to turn pages <br><br>  4) Port the client to popular * nix based platforms. <br><br>  5) Release the mobile version of the application, for android and iOS.  Most mobile jabber clients have not been updated for a year.  The situation is not normal. <br><br>  6) Make auto updates. <br><br>  <b>In fantasy:</b> <br><br>  To finalize the SIP connection and bring it to a stable working position, think about the expediency of video communication. <br><br>  Creating your own jabber-server lies in line with your feedback, on the one hand, there are so many different servers and we see no point in creating some kind of own server group, on the other hand, they often work unstable. <br><br>  Client under Win: <a href="">bitbucket.org/whoernet/wime/downloads/Wime-0.1.exe</a> <br>  md5 sum: 2b471cc0db49dbaf15f87ebb007e2aef <br><br>  Portable client under Win: <a href="">bitbucket.org/whoernet/wime/downloads/Portable%20Wime-0.1.exe</a> <br>  md5 sum: ff7f5f91bc606d4e8d91c2861785819d <br><br>  Sources: <a href="">bitbucket.org/whoernet/wime/get/v0.1.zip</a> <br>  md5 sum: a60fc7e756b4c9c756c728807966fb73 </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/368865/">https://habr.com/ru/post/368865/</a></p>
