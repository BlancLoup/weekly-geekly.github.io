This year we extended the acceptance of applications until March 1, which means that every observant developer reading these lines, whether he is a schoolboy or a student, has a chance at the end of spring to tell about his discoveries from the stands in front of thousands of the best hackers and security specialists. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The works of the participants of PHDays Young School will be considered by an authoritative jury composed of representatives of leading technology companies and specialized universities.  Among them:

    <ul><li>  Denis Gamayunov (VMK MSU), </li><li>  Alexey Kachalin (Advanced Monitoring), </li><li>  Peter Volkov (‚ÄúYandex‚Äù), </li><li>  Igor Kotenko (SPIIRAN), </li><li>  Nikita Abdullin (OpenWay), </li><li>  Pavel Laskov (Huawei European Research Center), </li><li>  Ekaterina Rudina (Kaspersky Lab), </li><li>  Yevgeny Tumoyan (YuR RUZC IB YuFU), </li><li>  Alexander Kolybelnikov (MIPT). </li></ul><br>  The organizers of the intellectual competition are not interested in regalia and not in the age of the participants, but in new approaches to various issues of information security.  Take, for example, 13-year-old Ayman Kampuri from Abu Dhabi, who cracked the encrypted messages of British intelligence, or an Australian teenager under the nickname <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/zzap/" class="user_link">zzap</a> , who managed to paralyze Twitter for several hours.  And what can you?  Found a new method of attack or defense - send your draft and become famous without breaking the law. <br><br>  In addition to the competitive aspects, participation in the competition is a good opportunity to see the capital of Russia.  Finalists will receive invitations to Positive Hack Days and full support from the organizers. <br><br>  During PHDays Young School, more than 50 applications from a dozen cities in Russia and the CIS were processed.  At the same time, the research of the participants is already being applied in real life.  For example, in 2013, the work ‚ÄúSystem of two-factor authentication based on QR codes‚Äù by Andrey Iskhakov from Tomsk University of control systems and radio electronics was recognized as the most interesting and promising.  Subsequently, the buildings of the special economic zone of Tomsk were equipped with a security system created by Andrey: electronic passes were replaced by a special identification program for employees' mobile phones. <br><br>  It should be noted that the first day of spring is directly related to programming.  March 1, Seymour Papert was born - a mathematician, expert in artificial intelligence and an outstanding programming popularizer.  Seymour was always sure: it was not a matter of human abilities, but organization of the learning process, he developed the concept of the school of the future, based on natural curiosity, and came up with a system that allows almost anyone to learn programming in the game.  So if you do not know how to program - it's time to start learning! <br><br>  Research abstracts are requested to be sent to <a href="">youngschool@phdays.com</a> with the name and surname of the applicant, the names of his co-authors, their places of work or study in the body of the letter.
