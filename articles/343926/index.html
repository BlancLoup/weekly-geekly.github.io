For example, when everything moves and changes, how to describe its program in five months in the conference announcement?  But although many of the details of the <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/"><b>Mobius 2018 Piter</b></a> will become known later, there are those that we are already ready to tell - and they may be enough to make a decision. <br><br>  To begin, let us announce the date: <b>April 20-21, 2018, St. Petersburg</b> .  The rest is under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  the main thing </h2><br>  Feedback received by us after previous Mobius, say that you like the format of the conference and the level of reports.  Therefore, everything that love the event will continue.  Again, there is a place for Android, for iOS, and for "platform-independent" themes.  The reports will be of a different format (from ‚Äúyou can embed right in your home tomorrow‚Äù to ‚Äúspecific information, but interesting and useful‚Äù).  They will also be labeled with icons meaning complexity, so that different viewers will be able to find suitable ones for themselves.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/1e0/e8c/fbc/1e0e8cfbc50f4a00a962b6dc6813df22.jpg"><br><br>  Like last year in St. Petersburg Mobius, there will be two days - this format allows you to go steadily and let the information digest.  And we will again make sure that you get the maximum from the speakers, and not only on the stage (if you haven‚Äôt been at Mobius before and become interested, read about it below in the ‚Äúdiscussion zones‚Äù section). <br><br>  Will there be something unusual in this case?  Yes, in addition to standard reports, we want to experiment.  We are thinking about two formats that have proven themselves at CocoaHeads meetings - a round table and a quiz.  So in the final program may well be, for example, a round table on Android and a quiz on iOS. <br><br><h2>  Speakers and Topics </h2><br>  For now we are ready to name a few speakers.  Spectators of previous Mobius have already managed to learn and love most of them: <br><br><img align="left" width="220" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tx/bi/ns/txbinsnfvtsgchsmo4_u0gflbl0.jpeg">  <b>Fernando cejas</b> <br><br>  Last year, Fernando, who was then working at SoundCloud, spoke at our conference for the first time with the report ‚ÄúHidden mysteries behind big mobile codebases‚Äù (you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D4Fyk1t1nSok">video</a> ).  And just the other day, he officially switched to IBM to the role of developer advocate - and for the reason ‚ÄúI like to share knowledge at conferences, and now I can do it more actively‚Äù. <br><br>  On the new Mobius, he will speak on the topic ‚ÄúWhat mom never told you about multithreading‚Äù, talking about how to manage multithreading on mobile platforms.  The emphasis is on Android, but the basic information will be platform-independent, so that iOS developers will be able to find something useful for themselves. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="220" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zj/zs/i6/zjzsi6avkydzkigrxytdxpi4dcy.jpeg">  <b>Hector zarate</b> <br><br>  Although we are happy to call reputed speakers with new topics, the list of speakers will not consist of ‚Äúveterans‚Äù alone.  And here, for example, a new face: a Swedish developer from Spotify, naming his post ‚ÄúiOS Cowboy‚Äù. <br><br>  But if it will appear on Mobius for the first time, then it is not new to the world of iOS development: in its <a href="https://github.com/iOSCowboy">iOSCowboy</a> GitHub account <a href="https://github.com/iOSCowboy">, the</a> first repositories are dated back to 2012.  At the conference, Hector will talk about architecture. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="220" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hu/li/cm/hulicmdpkhyn9vjwtkbp09h3jio.jpeg">  <b>Yonatan Levin</b> <br><br>  Jonathan became the clear favorite of the two previous Mobius (for example, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DsBllMIaA8to">report</a> ‚ÄúIPC: AIDL is not a curse word‚Äù received excellent marks).  Only recently the Moscow conference was <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/342636/">brightly concluded with</a> his costumed keyout, and we are already happy to announce that the next St. Petersburg will not do without him.  We will not name the specific topic so far - but it seems that many are already happy just to ‚Äúgo to Jonathan‚Äù, regardless of what exactly he will be talking about. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="220" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wb/u7/qr/wbu7qroflo66zuugxwvhxnvylz4.jpeg">  <b>Denis Neklyudov</b> <br><br>  It is hardly necessary to provide a detailed presentation of Denis to Android developers.  In addition to reports at previous conferences, he is known for his <a href="http://androiddev.apptractor.ru/">‚ÄúAndroid Dev Podcast‚Äù</a> (special issues are usually released during Mobius), and also as the first Google Developer Expert from Russia.  In the case of the recent Moscow Mobius, Denis departed from the usual role of a speaker, instead conducting a separate training (and occasionally participated in keynote Jonathan Levin as Jonathan Levin) - but in the spring in St. Petersburg, he will probably again deliver a report. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="220" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wu/st/th/wustthz2vg9pjn5qyqueynftzj4.jpeg">  <b>David Gonz√°lez</b> <br><br>  David, like Denis, holds the proud title of Google Developer Developer.  So he knows thoroughly many things related to Android, and this will help in his report ‚ÄúAndroid Authentication made simple‚Äù.  What could be more boring for the user than logging into the application?  And can there be something exciting for a developer to work on?  David believes that many developers do not really know about such things as Firebase Authentication or the new Fingerprint API - but in the end do not do something that could improve the lives of users. <br><br><hr><br><img align="left" width="220" src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e7/7f/_k/e77f_kc0trq7xmzghzdprpi6bxa.jpeg">  <b>Kirill Popov</b> <br><br>  In 2016, Cyril told Mobius about the use of Fresco ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DDf9xvmtOD5I">video</a> ), and then his report was one of the most highly rated by the audience.  And now, two years later, he will return to our scene.  We have not yet decided on the topic, but the number of options considers, for example, the use of a GPU - is that interesting for you? <br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Discussion areas </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/or/n-/hh/orn-hhg9ihu2vy8swpwfcqafutm.jpeg"><br><br>  For those who have been on the last Mobius, there will be no surprise in this, but everyone else should know.  In contrast to the usual approach, when the speaker after the speech has time for only a few questions from the audience, we make it so that everyone can ask their questions. <br><br>  How it works: each speaker immediately after his speech moves into the <b>discussion area</b> - a specially designed place with an illustration board, seating and the opportunity to grab a cup of coffee.  And everyone with a report that has raised questions can ask them there with feeling, sensibly, with an arrangement: delving into the nuances and clarifying everything incomprehensible. <br><br>  In general, it becomes clear ‚Äúwhy go to conferences when it is possible to watch and read something on the Internet‚Äù: it‚Äôs not just a one-way flow of information from experts that pours out, but there are detailed dialogues with them. <br><br><h2>  Online streaming </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_x/56/45/_x5645nuvvabspl5p0tb8zsa3cq.jpeg"><br><br>  All conference reports can be viewed online by <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/tickets/">purchasing the appropriate ticket</a> .  Such a broadcast has even a slight advantage over the live presence: if at the beginning of the report you suddenly realize that for some reason it does not fit, it is easier to switch to another room than to run between them. <br><br>  We are making a broadcast not for the first time, but from year to year it becomes only more beautiful.  Here are some recent improvements worth telling: <br><br><ul><li>  Video in 1440p - thanks to this, you can simultaneously display the presentation of the speaker in FullHD, and the speaker himself; </li><li>  Although the broadcast does not have access to the discussion areas, this does not mean that the audience does not ask any questions to the speakers at all.  They can be written in the <a href="https://t.me/mobiusconf">Telegram-chat of the conference</a> - and if there is enough time for them at the end of the report, the trackers will set them; </li><li>  And in the intervals between presentations, when the speakers and participants on the site are removed to the discussion zones, the audience of the online broadcast does not have to be bored, especially for them we make separate content: interviews with speakers and sponsors.  If you wish, you can get an idea about them by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D7pYJbHqiZTQ">recording the broadcast of</a> Mobius 2017 Moscow; </li><li>  The sound quality has been improved, the recording system has been seriously reworked; </li><li>  Many minor technical problems were solved, which most did not even notice, but they were there.  In general, the feeling of watching the broadcast should be better. </li></ul><br><h2>  Call for Papers </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/bz/co/6s/bzco6shdli9ggpb_9qj0t3d5ipc.jpeg"><br><br>  If you think that your place is not only in the hall, but also on the stage, and you are eager to speak at Mobius with a report - now is the time <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/cfp/">to apply</a> ! <br><br>  Previously, did not speak and do not quite understand what it will give you?  You can read our January <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/jugru/blog/319854/">post</a> , where several experienced speakers of our other conference presented their point of view. <br><br>  Not confident in your abilities?  Of course, our Program Committee ensures that only high-quality reports get to the conference, but at the same time it helps to make them better by sorting out the future report with the speaker and refining it.  So, if in doubt, you can apply, and then it becomes clearer. <br><br><h2>  Sponsorship booths </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tz/k4/iw/tzk4iwxzhcj8qbp1_7gcahfjlky.jpeg"><br><br>  We ourselves do not yet know the full list of stands that we will see in the spring at St. Petersburg Mobius, but we can remind you of what happened at the recent Moscow one: there, for example, the Avito company attracted a lot of attention with the Mum's Architect competition.  And now on Habr√© she <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/avito/blog/343642/">continues</a> this competition, and as the main prize she plays just a ticket for the Mobius 2018 Piter!  Probably, in St. Petersburg, too, will not do without an interesting movement - so that during breaks it will be possible not only to torture speakers who spoke with questions. <br><br><h2>  To buy tickets </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tf/fm/mo/tffmmoc6m1pba07wteq-vwtaonk.jpeg"><br><br>  Registration is already open - and now you can <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/tickets/">purchase a ticket</a> at an early bird-price.  And since January 1, they are more expensive.  So, if the information above was enough, it makes sense to decide now.  And if you are not ready yet - you can follow the <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/">site</a> , it will gradually be updated with new names of speakers and reports names. <br><br>  <b>See you at the Mobius 2018 Piter!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/343926/">https://habr.com/ru/post/343926/</a></p>
