  <section class="page js-page"><h1>MTS - Beep. For what I have written off 2000 p., But with a happy ending</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It all started with an SMS that I have debts under other personal accounts issued to me.  When I called and found out what the numbers were (only the contract numbers were indicated in the SMS, not the phone numbers, although it was much simpler), I immediately paid off the debt on one of them, and, as an agreement with MTS, you can only terminate it personally, blocked it for loss, because  he was with ab.  I didn‚Äôt use the board for a year anyway. <br><br>  But on the second number I had questions, because I didn‚Äôt seem to know this number and I don‚Äôt want to give 1900 for what I didn‚Äôt want, after a couple of calls and promises to call me back, I still heard that I bought this number in 2005 ( then I remembered that there was such a thing).  To the question of how a prepaid number with no subscription fee could generate such debt, I was told that it could be paid SMS.  Again, the question of what exactly, when and for what, they suddenly told me that I could only answer this question in person at the office.  The belief that it could always be done by telephone without personal attendance did not lead to anything.  And since  I didn't have the mood to argue then, I scored.  Then I called MTS again myself, but at that moment I was not up to it.  And since  it was Friday, then I safely forgot about it until Saturday, when I saw the empty bill. <br><br>  Happy End - <a name="habracut"></a>

      Another call to the MTS and a successful breakthrough through the first line of the call center to the imputed specialist allowed me to find out within 1 minute that the money had been charged for the service Beep.  In response, I said that since 2005 I had not used the phone, did not turn it on, and in general I had this sim card during the week when my phone was stolen.  The specialist looked, agreed with me, apologized, said that the Beep service was turned on erroneously and submitted a request for a refund to my number and unlock the number, which was soon done. <br><br>  It took about 5 minutes for the whole conversation. Before that, it took me half an hour to clear up. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99580/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99580/</a></p>
