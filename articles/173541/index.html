There is no need to go far for an example, a simple search query of the form ‚Äú <a href="http://goo.gl/jcFcO">car recall due to a defect</a> ‚Äù will give us this result

I was surprised to find that such cases are extremely rare and not all vendors have it, <br><br>  Here <a href="http://www.avlantek.com/news/avlantek/164.html">Sony recalls a batch of Vaio laptops</a> because of overheating and burns to customers or <a href="http://forum.ruboard.ru/archive/index.php/t-66057.html">Toshiba recalls laptops due to a defect in Intel's chipsets</a> <br><br>  If you look closely, such news is extremely rare and not all vendors have this practice. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  My case </h4><br><br>  In October 2012, I decided to purchase an ‚Äúultrabook‚Äù so that it was light, thin and as powerful as possible.  The obvious choice is to take the air from the apple, but the products of this company are not close to me, and their performance characteristics are far from the most vigorous. <br><br>  The choice fell on the flagship ultra asus ux32vd, which only entered the market, because of the excellent hardware and advanced features described in the description, such as fast hibernation from Intel Rapid Storage to the dedicated SSD, availability of a discrete and really powerful video card nVidia 620M with 1Gb and so on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/076/69a/280/07669a28051fae9a2d76bbe90c30e2ed.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  After reading all the available reviews at the time, I did not find much negative, I took $ 1500 and went shopping.  Joy knew no bounds, works unrealistically quickly, checked the battlefield - flies, goes into hibernation in a couple of seconds, the battery holds, FullHD at 13.3 "delivers. A little heated with strong use, but in Siberia it is not a problem as much as 9 months a year. <br><br>  I worked the laptop for a week and died, not quite surely, both screws (SDD + HDD) ‚Äúflew off‚Äù, and as it turned out in fact SSD - absolutely, HDD - at the level of logical errors.  Such a turn of affairs was certainly not pleasing, and I returned the ux32vd to the store after collecting the money. <br><br>  After searching for a replacement from other manufacturers, I did not find anything worthwhile and could not agree to the lack of fullHD, i7 and sluggish graphics card from competitors, decided to wait a bit and went to Thailand for the winter.  There already, I decided to try again, the same model, are there many chances to get a defective thing twice?  Once again googled, there were a couple of similar cases, but nothing systemic.  Ordered 1: 1 the same in the US, but only the most recent revision, and even with Win8 on board.  By the way, they delivered it from LA to Koh Samui in 4 days. <br><br>  It took a couple of months and problems started, Intel Rapid Storage refused, refused to go into hibernation, OS loading and shutdown equated to criminal - from 3 to 5 minutes for each operation (as it turned out, because of an attempt to interrogate SSD and no response).  And soon, SSD dies again, for good.  It was here that, as they say, it ‚Äúdawned on‚Äù that the fool himself, that the model is crude and defective.  By re-googling, I found hundreds (I think there are thousands) of 1: 1 reviews and symptoms for this model that appeared in the last month, practically speaking - by buying this ultrabook you are very likely to encounter the fact that the SSD will die. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bdc/36e/c4a/bdc36ec4a6748fc1dff901a32e58d463.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  What does asus do? </h4><br><br>  Asus, like many other manufacturers, continues to sell and watches the avalanche-like return of the model, but does not stop sales.  In any case, asus offers to send the defective ultrabook to the service center at its own expense (in the US) and promises to replace the motherboard (ssd "soldered" in it) within 2-4 weeks and return the product back.  Brilliant! <br><br>  I absolutely do not understand why, asus does not like its customers so much and shifts the problems of logistics of a defective product (which is $ 100-200 in a particular case) to them to the factory to replace the motherboard.  Although, this is much cheaper than withdrawing the entire batch at the expense of the manufacturer, stopping sales, and yes, for an adult suffering deserved, note, reputational losses. <br><br>  The funny thing is that even the US support for asus, in their offspring, acknowledges the defect, and the support employee agrees that his employer, to put it mildly, is neither good nor ethical.  Below is the proof of chatik without the name of the employee (he's not to blame). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e17/901/98a/e1790198a068b691fc4137322caf8950.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br><br>  There are a lot of words being said today about how the IT industry sets standards for management, marketing, quality of support, customer focus, etc.  Well, I have to admit that so far away. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173541/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173541/</a></p>
