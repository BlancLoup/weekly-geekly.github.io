In this article I will talk about the cultural and ideological origins of the kaizen business model.  In my story, I will mainly rely on the wonderful book of the Japanese philosopher Daisetsu Taitaro Suzuki ‚ÄúThe Basics of Zen Buddhism‚Äú.  The book is magnificent, with an extraordinary heat for the Japanese, the author reveals to the readers the eastern perception of the surrounding world.  We will trace the philosophy of Zen in modern Japanese corporations, which should help us in the future to correctly apply kaizen methods in our work, here I first of all mean kanban. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h1>  What is Zen </h1><br>  Zen is a religion.  Followers of this religion claim that the world is divided into the world of feelings, the world of mind and the spiritual world.  Further, in Zen, it is stated that the mind, which should serve man, takes up too much space in the process of world perception, and hinders the comprehension of the spiritual life.  In fact, the world of feelings, the world of mind and spirit is one, and once a person realizes this, he will be free and reach a state of harmony with the world. In understanding the world, Zen attaches crucial importance to personal experience and has the following features: <br><ol><li>  Neglect of form. </li><li>  The inwardness of zen inwards implies that it directly appeals to the spirit of man <br>  Immediacy is synonymous with simplicity.  When all the fanciful forms of expressing ideas are dropped, one blade of grass replaces the sixteen foot Buddha Vairochana. </li><li>  Poverty and simplicity are combined in Zen, but simply being poor and modest is not yet Zen. </li><li>  Facts and experience are valued in Zen more than images, symbols, and concepts, in other words, essence in Zen is everything, and form is nothing. </li><li>  What could be called ‚Äúeternal loneliness‚Äù is closely related to the essence of Zen.  This is a kind of absolute feeling, detachment from the surrounding world. </li></ol><br>  When all these aspects of Zen are established, we see a certain Zen attitude to life in general.  When he expresses himself in art, he makes up what can be called the spirit of Zen Buddhist aesthetics.  It manifests itself in simplicity, spontaneity, courage, sublimity, detachment from the outside world, depth inside, indifference to the form.

    <h1>  Sumie </h1><br>  Next comes an extensive quotation from Daisetsu Taitaro Suzuki‚Äôs book ‚ÄúThe Basics of Zen Buddhism,‚Äù in which I highlighted the key points for our question: <br><br>  ‚ÄúTo illustrate, let me dwell on Japanese painting, known as the Sumy.  Sumy does not represent painting in the strict sense of the word: it is a kind of black and white sketch.  The ink is made from soot and glue, and the brush is made from the wool of a sheep or badger, and it can hold a large amount of this liquid.  The paper used for drawing is quite thin and absorbs a large amount of ink, drastically different from the canvas used by the artists in oil, and this contrast is of great importance for the artist of the genre of sums.  The reason why such material is chosen to convey inspiration from the artist is that ego inspiration should be transmitted <b>as soon as possible</b> .  If the brush lasts too long, the paper will tear.  The lines should be <b>applied as quickly as possible</b> , and their number should be minimal, <b>only the most necessary lines are applied.</b>  <b>No sluggishness</b> , no erasure, no repetition, retouching, <b>no alteration, no ‚Äúcure‚Äù, no montage are allowed</b> .  Once applied, smears can not be washed away, re-applied and are <b>not subject to further amendments or finishing touches</b> .  Any smear applied after, sharply and painfully stands out due to the specific properties of the paper.  The artist must constantly, completely and involuntarily follow his inspiration.  He simply allows him to control his hands, fingers, and brush, as if they, along with his whole being, are merely a tool in the hands of someone else who has temporarily moved into him.  We can say that the <b>brush does the work itself, regardless of the artist</b> , who simply allows her to move, without making any conscious effort.  If there is any logical connection or reflection between the brush and the paper, the whole effect disappears.  This is how summation is born.  ... The line drawn by the artist of the genre of sumy is distinguished by completeness, nothing can go beyond its limits, nothing can fix it;  it is as inevitable as a flash of lightning: the artist himself cannot remove it;  This explains the beauty of the line.  <b>Things are beautiful where they are inevitable</b> , that is, when they are a free manifestation of the spirit. ‚Äù <br><br><h1>  Sumie and Kanban </h1><br>  If we read the summation technique description, we will notice something in common with the kanban system: <br><br>  <i>Every moment of work must be performed with high quality.</i>  ‚ÄúDoubt in one movement with a brush ruins the whole picture.  In sum - the paper will break, in kanban - the rhythm of the work will be broken, there will be a shortage of individual parts with a general excess. <br><br>  <i>All actions are subject to the general order.</i>  Brush strokes in sumy, each of which individually can mean anything, generally form a common picture.  Each action in kanban in itself does not make any sense, unless one action pulls the other along with it, making up the overall process. <br><br>  <i>It is impossible to copy the</i> picture of sumie, and it is also impossible to copy the kanban methodology from one enterprise to another. <br><br>  <i>It is impossible to draw up a plan in advance</i> , according to which a sheet of paper will be filled in with the Sumy technique.  The artist knows what he should get the result, but he does not know what will appear on the sheet of paper first, and then what.  And in Kanban there is no detailed plan for each link, there is only a general sales plan. <br><br>  <i>Sumie - voplschenie poverty</i> .  Poverty of form, poverty of technology, poverty of material, poverty of content.  This is an extremely economical form of painting.  In Kanban, the principle of economy is embodied in a small amount of stocks, in a tightly linked chain of interaction. <br><br><h1>  Total </h1><br>  Kanban, the same reflection of Zen in material culture, as painting sum.  He also has his own aesthetics.  But, unlike sumy, kanban can be transferred from the Japanese soil to any other.  And in the continuation of this cycle we will talk about the use of kanban in software development. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64089/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64089/</a></p>
