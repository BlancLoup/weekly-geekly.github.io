I think it is no secret to anyone that the huge international exhibition IFA 2012 is now taking place in Berlin, at which many manufacturers show their achievements, new products, long-awaited and awaited devices.  This statement was not an exception for Samsung. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/143/9cc/526/1439cc52617ef17ccecb332ca5957aaf.png"><br><br>  You have already been introduced to Note II, so let me briefly talk about other devices that were shown at the exhibition, but did not have time to get on Habr.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Smart tv </h4><br>  We begin, perhaps, with not the most popular in Habre direction - television.  With the advent of the Internet, interest in TV is not something that would fall - it has changed.  The Internet offered new rules for the game: the content you choose yourself, social networks, freedom of choice, and a huge amount of all sorts of information that varies greatly in its composition and playback / perception method.  Regular television with ‚Äúnews on the first channel‚Äù was forced to respond to the new rules of the game, and Smart TV technologies appeared at various manufacturers ‚Äî enhanced possibilities for interacting with digital content and global networks.  Samsung is one of the pioneers and leaders of this movement, and the latest developments in this field were presented at the IFA. <br><br>  Among the new products that are particularly noteworthy is a special guest - the OLED TV ES9500 with a diagonal of 55 inches and full support for the latest technologies Samsung Smart TV and Smart Hub. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/179/025/694/1790256948f14b60e030585e5a0e2889.png"><br><br>  Excellent picture quality and amazing black depth, coupled with a thin frame and excellent color rendering do not leave competitors any chance - among dozens of similar models on supermarket shelves, this TV will consistently attract glances and cause increased attention to itself.  But its main ‚Äúkiller feature‚Äù is the ability for two viewers to watch two programs at the same time, without any interference to each other.  Thanks to an unprecedentedly short response time and special 3D glasses with integrated headphones, the content is perfectly normal for each user. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/04c/825/cf4/04c825cf4f256bbf5b491b2b75d4b723.png"><br><br>  In addition, I would like to mention the new 75-inch flagship ES9000, supporting the latest developments in the field of Smart TV-content and the game Anrgy Birds, which can be controlled for the first time without touching the device.  Have you ever played "birds" at least half of the 75-inch diagonal?  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b8c/763/96b/b8c76396bdefebc093e3f49385bd7a88.png"><br><br><h4>  Smart photo </h4><br><br>  One of the most unusual devices presented by Samsung at the exhibition was ... a mobile smart camera ‚ÄúGALAXY Camera‚Äù.  This hybrid of the "ultrazoom" and the smartphone has a 16MPix matrix with BSI technology, 21x optical zoom, image stabilizer, support for 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi networks, as well as a huge and truly chic HD display with a diagonal of 4.55 inches.  All this splendor works under the operating system Android 4.1 JellyBean. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/21c/7f9/c77/21c7f9c775ccadbb2f04efd086f02d58.png"><br><br>  In addition to the functionality provided by the Google operating system, the camera is equipped with a built-in image editor and special multi-mode software that corrects the sensor's behavior depending on external conditions and the selected shooting program.  In addition, the camera will get access to the Auto Cloud Backup service and Samsung Allshare, which makes it easy to share and play content and not be afraid for its safety. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/73a/016/e79/73a016e7922e4bf48e47f8c202f73013.png"><br><br><h4>  Smart pc </h4><br><br>  The new operating system from Microsoft was not ignored.  Samsung presented a whole line of devices called ATIV, consisting of tablets, PC-transformers, and smartphones running Windows 8. <br><br>  The Samsung ATIV S is a slim and stylish WP8 based smartphone.  Inside, everything is the same as for ‚Äúadult‚Äù models on Android - a 1.5 GHz dual-core processor, support for various wireless protocols and interfaces, an excellent screen with HD resolution and a diagonal of 4.8 inches, made using HD SuperAmoled technology. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ab9/cea/06e/ab9cea06e6e46d2787b4230fd8933f38.png"><br><br>  Samsung ATIV Tab like you.  perhaps guessed it - a tablet based on Windows RT.  It has a 10.1 inch display, a battery with a capacity of 8200 mAh, full functionality of the new OS, and an integrated Office suite Office 2013 RT Preview. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/05a/4a9/b05/05a4a9b055a45e17d8dc82f0d7c98221.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e30/a5d/d85/e30a5dd855ff7dccbc486ad15177edd2.png"><br><br>  Samsung ATIV Smart PC and Smart PC PRO are transformer laptops that can work both in ‚Äútablet‚Äù and in ‚Äúfull-fledged‚Äù modes.  They are united by a form factor, a 11.6 inch FullHD LCD display, a S Pen, familiar to you from the Galaxy S Note II, a proprietary software package that allows you to make the most of the transformer in ‚Äútablet‚Äù mode, as well as a set of interfaces.  Each device contains 2 USB ports, mHDMI, microSD connector, and 2 additional USB 2.0 ports in the keyboard dock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/72c/935/174/72c93517436bace8854cfebc80de0762.png"><br><br>  The devices differ in the filling - Smart PC contains the latest generation Intel Atom, USB 2.0 ports in the ‚Äútablet‚Äù part and lives up to 14 hours from the battery.  The elder brother of Smart PC PRO is built on the Core i5 architecture, in the ‚Äútablet‚Äù - USB 3.0, and the autonomous navigation time reaches eight hours.  not bad for such a device, is it? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/3d7/6b6/9c2/3d76b69c27d7025bd030c72a41bd99a2.png"><br><br><h4>  Smart desktop </h4><br><br>  Another new product is the new line of AIO monoblocks (all in one) with the most extensive features.  The older device in the line has a 27 "screen with a resolution of 2560x1440, a <b><i>matte</i></b> display made by PLS technology. Inside is the latest generation Core i7, up to 8 gigabytes of DDR3 memory, discrete video from Radeon (model 7850M with two gigabytes of GDDR5 memory), all current wired and wireless interfaces. <br><br>  The younger version is 23.6 "Full HD with a matte finish, i5 or i3 inside, up to 8 gigabytes of memory, a slightly weaker 7690 video card with 1 GB GDDR5 and the same wired / wireless interface. Perhaps a bit later, the performance characteristics of intermediate models will be announced. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/9e1/a77/c7d/9e1a77c7d09cf1d586b93189265ccf66.png"><br><br>  The main ‚Äúkiller feature‚Äù of these solutions is multi-touch input (up to 10 touches) and gesture recognition using an integrated HD camera. <br>  Given the new features of Windows 8 (which will be on board these devices) - it turns out an excellent cocktail of stylish appearance, tremendous possibilities and flexibility in use.  High-tech "stuffing" easily cope with editing photos and videos, games, movies in high definition and any other work, and the compact body and excellent screen quality will make sure that your choice is easier.  :) <br><br><h4>  Smart display </h4><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/632/df4/c18/632df4c186d3a4b3d957a3a58e0698a3.png"><br><br>  Not forgotten and B2B segment.  At the IFA were presented new screens: <b>UD22b</b> and <b>NL22B</b> .  The first is a special 22-inch panel with an aspect ratio of 1 to 1, designed to build a special ‚ÄúVideo Wall‚Äù.  In such a product, the Samsung Direct LED backlight technology was first used, which emits much less heat and consumes significantly less energy than conventional LED systems, and a thin frame of 5.5 millimeters and the ability to combine up to 100 panels in arbitrary order and form (and not necessarily on planes!) allow you to make really amazing video installations.  Included is a special Samsung MagicInfo software that easily allows you to centrally manage all this well-being. <br><br>  The second novelty - NL22b - not just a screen.  This is a whole hardware and software system for presenting products, with a unique feature - a transparent LED-screen.  In the kit, in addition to the transparent LCD panel, - protective glass, mini-PC and speakers - a complete set for an interactive presentation.  It turns out the effect of augmented reality without having to wear special glasses or ‚Äúscan the world‚Äù with a smartphone / tablet camera. <br><br>  Until the exhibition is over, you can watch the recordings from the Samsung press conferences <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ru/unpacked2012/">here</a> . <br>  Any press materials (press releases, photos and videos) are available <a href="http://samsungifa2012.com/">here</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/150631/">https://habr.com/ru/post/150631/</a></p>
