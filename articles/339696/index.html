Knowledge in this case refers to the texts of scientific and educational materials, diagrams, drawings, formulas of 2D and 3D models and other educational and scientific informational content. </p><br><p>  Since we, the members of this community, have the knowledge and skills, and are often citizens of the target state, I propose to discuss: </p><br><ul><li>  The feasibility of the project </li><li>  The need for this project technology like "blockchain" </li><li>  Architecture options and project implementation methods </li><li>  Other thoughts on this </li></ul><br><p>  On what you can put the cat, under which I will leave some of my thoughts and interesting excerpts from the text. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Excerpts of the project</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  As a result of the project, a completely new university network platform will be created, allowing: </p><br><ol><li>  To create and legally enter into circulation a significant in volume, reliable and relevant in content complex of information resources, including the "critical mass" of electronic scientific, educational and educational resources. </li><li>  Provide authors with ‚Äúbarrier-free‚Äù input of knowledge into the system, bypassing the traditional mechanisms for creating and publishing content and offering automatic participation in subsequent chains of circulation of the object of intellectual property. </li><li>  Exclude from the processes of intellectual property turnover for the needs of science and education intermediaries, increasing the rationality of the use of financial resources of universities for information support. </li><li>  To improve the quality of educational and scientific activities by organizing collaboration activities of university staff in creating scientific, educational and methodological materials, putting research data into circulation. </li><li>  Introduce a system of objective assessment of the demand for works of science, literature and art according to a variety of indicators (downloadability, citation, usability, etc.), thereby forming a fundamentally new system of metric evaluations in the university environment. </li><li>  Introduce elements of gamification of the system, linking internal activity to a complex of tangible and intangible rewards, providing deserved reward, transparency and public control over the knowledge that is wrapped in the ecosystem being formed. </li><li>  Introduce effective mechanisms for managing the rights to the results of intellectual activity in universities that comply with the civil legislation of the Russian Federation, and at the same time create a fundamentally new, progressive culture of working with intellectual property necessary to meet the challenges of developing the digital economy. </li><li>  To form an effective system of distributed depositing and recording rights based on blockchain technologies, ensuring the aggregation and legalization of digital content being turned around in a university environment. </li><li>  Create a separate virtual environment on the basis of a system of digital rules that allows not only increasing the transparency and effectiveness of the scientist (teams, collaborations), but also getting the necessary experience and testing practices that will become the basis for the development of the entire national intellectual property system. </li></ol><br><p>  The purpose and objectives of the project: <br>  a) project objectives: </p><br><p>  The goal of the project is to create a digital platform for the exchange of knowledge and copyright management based on the aggregation of copyright objects created in higher educational institutions and ensuring the circulation of such objects and their rights on the basis of technologies of distributed registries. </p><br><p>  The novelty of the project is: </p><br><ul><li>  in the creation of an integrated platform implemented in the vein of the Open Science paradigm, built on a distributed registry combining copyright fixation, depositing objects, a search system and a gratuitous and (or) conditionally free exchange of objects between students, teachers and researchers working in leading universities; </li><li>  replacing the economic institute of mediation with a platform that provides consumers with the opportunity to carry out direct interaction with content producers, including the flexible change of their roles; </li><li>  ecosystem formation, where the system of real and virtual incentives based on the principles of gamification of social systems will be tested as the basis of economic relations. </li></ul><br><p>  b) project objectives: <br>  To achieve this goal it is necessary to solve the following main tasks. </p><br><ol><li>  Develop formats for introducing knowledge (depositing objects) into the system, develop standards for placing new forms for describing digital objects suitable for the production of various objects (including incomplete) intellectual activities created in universities. </li><li>  Organize a sustainable interaction of project participants, including the processes of depositing objects in the depositories of participants and recording the facts of deposit, information about rights, their transfer and use of objects using a distributed registry based on blockchain technologies. </li><li>  Develop a digital platform for sharing knowledge and copyright management (hereinafter referred to as the digital platform, system), including the following functions: <br>  a) placing in a distributed form of knowledge in the format of a complete object, and in the format of incomplete objects (data fragments, texts, models, code, etc.); <br>  b) verification of the authenticity of the committed actions and the accuracy of information regarding intellectual property items, including the fixing of priority without human participation; <br>  c) the introduction into circulation of new forms of describing digital objects created by universities, necessary for the realization of the priorities of scientific and technological development - genetic resources, three-dimensional, information models, etc .; <br>  d) development of models of intellectual comparison and comparison of recorded in digital form objects of law, allowing to determine their uniqueness completely or in separate elements; <br>  e) monetization, including conditionally free use and deferred monetization, as well as the possibility of paying fair remuneration to the best authors from various university funds for incentive payments. </li><li>  To test and implement a gamification module to create a new virtual ecosystem for scientists, in which there are incentives for intensive generation of knowledge, research, services, peer review, and creativity assessment. </li></ol></div></div><br><h3 id="mysli-na-temu">  Thoughts on the topic </h3><br><p>  The state proposes to create a decentralized infrastructure that allows unambiguously establish authorship and access to the content.  There is already a system that it can: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_System">Handle System</a> , on top of which <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_object_identifier">DOI‚Äôs</a> science known to all people works.  Some time ago, the state was interested in creating its own DOI registrar, and even published a <a href="http://s.siteapi.org/808b25df7dd28c9.ru/docs/494d0aa0ed82f57b2dbd27a7b60c699d0148db30.pdf">book</a> about it.  However, the project and the foundation that campaigned for it were collapsed and reorganized, and the current project with the blockchain in the lead role was presented to the people. </p><br><p>  The key question is whether it makes sense to use a blockchain in this context.  To understand, you need to break the system into parts and consider them in more detail. </p><br><p>  The scientific environment creates a lot of data.  A lot of data.  There is no way to store them centrally.  Hence, it is necessary to store distributed.  And distribute distributed.  The torrent protocol proved to be the best in this task, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPFS">IPFS</a> looks very good.  To establish authorship, each object in the system is signed by the author's key. </p><br><p>  The order deals with fragmentation and the possibility of splitting and merging content objects.  For such tasks, git is fine in most cases.  If a separate file can be addressed by its hash in IPFS, then with git we can address to a specific file state by adding a commit identifier.  Of course, commits are signed.  In fact, the commit tree of the repository becomes what we need for the unequivocal establishment of authorship and unambiguous addressing.  However, git does not provide for the transfer of authorship.  Re-signed commit becomes another commit. </p><br><p>  It is this problem, theoretically, it makes sense to solve with the blockchain.  The blockchain exists in parallel with the addressing system and distributed repositories, and stores transactions with respect to the copyright on objects of the system.  The object in this case is considered a specific state (file hash + commit id).  Thus, it is not difficult to find out who created the object and who owns the rights to it. </p><br><p>  However, in this system, the problems of the modern copyright system will be seen in full.  For example: </p><br><p>  Researcher A is working on the best way to extract oil from the earth's interior and publishes draft papers in the system.  Researcher B creates his own designs based on the drafts.  Company P at some point notes that research A gives a strong competitive advantage, buys work A and transfers them to the status of a trade secret or makes a patent.  However, the works of commercial value for H do not have, but they have fundamental value, and value for potential competitors N. Attention, the question: who and how now determines the fate of the works of researcher ? </p><br><p>  Researcher Yu developed and sold some of his work to the company D. However, after the sale he found out that the work can be of fundamental value if you make several changes to it.  Does Yu have the right to make such changes and publish a new fundamental research, if it affects the commercially valuable data that D bought from Yu? </p><br><h3 id="mysli-po-melocham">  Small thoughts </h3><br><p>  Very interesting is the prospect of embedding the content identification system directly in the editors.  So that, for example, Inkscape or OpenOffice automatically register a newly created document after a person. </p><br><p>  There would be no problems with copyright if, instead of competition, enterprises cooperated to create new methods and scientific developments.  It would not make sense to hide these developments and hinder the development of science.  And a blockchain in such a system would not be needed. </p><br><p> Gamification ... what the hell, gamification, if you can make likes.  We are social creatures, we will hurt our foreheads for huskies than for achivki. </p><br><h3 id="eschyo-interesnyh-goszakazov-pro-obrazovanie">  More interesting government orders about education </h3><br><p>  <a href="https://4science.ru/finsupports/Razrabotka-arhitekturi-informacionnih-nauchno-obrazovatelnih-resursov">The development of the architecture of information scientific and educational resources</a> is what was discussed in the epic <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3D%25D0%259D%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F%2B%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B6%25D1%258C">Uneducated Youth</a> .  The state sometimes hears us.  But can not do anything. <del>  Sawed to us. </del></p><br><p>  <a href="https://4science.ru/finsupports/Sozdanie-nauchno-obrazovatelnogo-resursa-dlya-visokotehnologichnih-sektorov-ekonomiki">Creating a resource for the aggregation of scientific and educational content</a> - Also an interesting idea.  Navigating educational channels in YouTube, VK groups and, moreover, individual resources is a non-trivial task.  For sometimes not even cross-links.  The trouble is that in the state system only content creators permitted by the state will gather. </p><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">And if you think</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  why is the state going to aggregate enthusiasts at all, instead of creating a system that would be good even without education enthusiasts? </p></div></div><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Warning: political politics</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h3 id="pochemu-goszakazy---ne-dlya-nas">  Why state orders are not for us </h3><br><p>  Finish on sad.  Government orders, which I have shown, are not bad in their essence.  However, getting them is almost impossible.  I will give a simple example: a startup school, even though I don‚Äôt like them, is given up to 60 days to apply.  Projects for state orders are much more complicated than what comes to start-up schools.  However - 20 days.  That is, to obtain such a state order you need to know about its creation in advance.  Or create an immediate response department, which will only deal with tracking and preparation of applications. </p></div></div></div>
