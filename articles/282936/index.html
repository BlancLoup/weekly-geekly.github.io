The entire content is described by these two words and revealed to us in a hundred recipes on 380+ pages.  Waiting for the release of the final version of Rails 5, this reading is something that is worth the time, the benefit will not need it so much.  But this investment will return a huge profit of knowledge and will allow, as stated on the cover, <i>"to create Rails-applications with inhuman speed</i> . <i>"</i>  And not only Rails, and not only Ruby.  The first two chapters include an abundance of information on working with the terminal and SLE.  Details under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I stumbled upon the sample of the chapter from the book that was still being prepared last summer, became interested and subscribed to the newsletter so as not to lose sight of this work.  For some time there was a lull, I occasionally went to the book site, just in case, but there were no changes.  And now either at the end of the past, or at the beginning of this year, I received a letter, happily informing about the completion of work and a quick publication. <br><br>  In the courtyard May gradually followed April, the <i>book was published</i> .

      Efficient Rails is a <i>collection of recipes for optimizing development workflow</i> , which are not explicitly described in any manuals.  We turn to the content: <br><br>  <i><b>Part 1. Tools</b> - setting up the working environment</i> <br>  <b>Chapter 1. Terminal</b> (improvement of the standard terminal and work with it) <br>  <b>Chapter 2. Git</b> (approaches to working with git and solving non-standard situations encountered in the daily routine) <br>  <b>Chapter 3. Rails Console</b> (Hidden Potential Rail Console) <br>  <i><b>Part 2. Code</b> - methods for optimizing code in Rails projects</i> <br>  <b>Chapter 4. Models</b> (accents are placed on poorly documented parts of working with models) <br>  <b>Chapter 5. Controllers</b> (solving important in the opinion of the author problems related to controllers) <br>  <b>Chapter 6. Representations</b> (the section is obligatory for analysis after reading the documentation or the book a la Agile Web Development) <br>  <b>Chapter 7. Assets</b> (simplifying work with assets in dev-environments and unobvious moments of Turbolinks) <br>  <b>Chapter 8. Working with mail</b> (cool tricks for setting up and testing mail sending) <br>  <i><b>Part 3. Techniques and techniques</b> - approaches to testing and debugging</i> <br>  <b>Chapter 9. Testing</b> (section on setting up a test environment on the example of live Rails projects) <br>  <b>Chapter 10. Debugging</b> (advanced debugging with pry and not only) <br><br>  Most of what is written in the book is recognized in two ways: <br><ul><li>  you really ran into a problem and began to search through the Internet in search of a solution (in a book under 400 pages, just imagine how much time you have to spend to find everything); </li><li>  from more experienced colleagues (sometimes you do not even realize that the difficulty that has arisen has a solution or you do not understand at all that this is not a feature, but a real problem). </li></ul><br>  Therefore, summing up, at least 3 groups of developers are allocated for which the book is suitable: <br><ol><li>  freelancers without direct access to colleagues for the exchange of experience; </li><li>  young professionals who have mastered Rails well on test projects and are working in their first job; </li><li>  experienced professionals, for whom the book will become a fresh look at its own set of tools and techniques for solving problems that have long been formed. </li></ol><br>  And of course, the book will suit curious Ruby developers, regardless of experience or field of activity, allowing you to save a lot of time searching for solutions to optimize the workflow, find weaknesses and see alternatives. <br><br>  Personally, for myself, I discovered a lot of new useful things and learned about other possibilities in familiar tools that I use every day.  For example, zsh and tig are my old friends.  Having learned the basics of the first one and using the second one as a git-log reader, I could not have thought how much the first one hides, and that the second is in fact a full-fledged <i>‚Äúconsole GUI client for the gita‚Äù</i> .  The ideal work with the book, as I see it (and how I use it for myself) - having carefully run through the whole book, proceed to the daily introduction of one unfamiliar technique.  Yesterday I finally cleaned the old branches, today in practice I will compare the differences between the work of tig and git, and tomorrow ... <i>and tomorrow is Saturday</i> . <br><br>  Summing up the story, I‚Äôll note that I‚Äôm <b>not affiliated with the author in any way</b> , I just decided to support such a great book so that you can spend the time saved.  I will not even get any interest on the book sales from this article.  Well, writing a review allowed me to get a promotional code for a discount for the Habra community, because the official price of a book with the current dollar rate bites even for Rails developers.  By the way, I am very grateful to Andrew for such a generous discount.  Even if you are not going to buy a book, <b>be sure to read the <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/efficientrails/efficient_rails_sample.pdf">free chapter</a></b> , it is very useful. <br><br>  <a href="https://gumroad.com/l/efficient-rails/Habrahabr"><b>Buy a book for $ 20 <i>(50% discount)</i></b></a> <br><br>  Author <a href="https://twitter.com/allenan_">Andrew Allen</a> <br>  <a href="https://www.efficientrails.com/">Book site</a> <br><br>  Great weekend to everyone! <br><br>  <i>PS Taking this opportunity, I want to say that we at Mesto.ru are inspired by good code, try to find and apply new approaches to its improvement, and invite those who are not indifferent to join our small, cozy team.</i>  <i>Write in a personal!</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/282936/">https://habr.com/ru/post/282936/</a></p>
