  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IDCEE 2014 Conference Impressions of a non-brand startup</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  October 9-10, in Kiev, the traditional conference of IDCEE (Investor's Day Central and Eastern Europe), which has already become traditional, was held.  Thanks to the marketing genius of the conference organizers, our startup: <a href="http://www.theonlypage.com/">TheOnlyPage</a> took part in this event. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ed/79e/156/2ed79e156ccf372b7175323068a8bc92.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this publication, you will not find a review of startups that took part, nothing will be said about presentations at plenary sessions and events to select the best startups.  Only impressions from 2 days of participation in the start-up alley. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Two years ago, with another startup, or rather with the first incarnation of <a href="http://www.theonlypage.com/">TheOnlyPage,</a> I participated in a similar event: IDCEE 2012. The impressions were the following: all very rich, excellent food, lined up along the lobby tables of a glass of white and red wine.  Opportunity to talk with representatives of incubators and funds operating in Ukraine.

But a letter came from the organizers that funding had been received for free participation, a start-up must be submitted to the competition.  From the free as you give up, submitted for the competition, and accordingly tuned in to participate.  And when it turned out that the competition failed (which and how many startups participating for free were not reported) paid UAH 2786 (a little more than $ 200). <br><br>  The alley of startups was a square room, tightly lined with stands, which for some reason were illuminated from the ceiling with bright colored floodlights of acid colors. <br><br>  Impressions from the work on the avenue of startups are as follows: <br><br>  All 112 participating startups were presented on <a href="http://idcee.org/rus/startups/competition/">the event website</a> in advance and potential investors had the opportunity to familiarize themselves with and aim at visiting specific stands. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d2/9b1/23b/4d29b123b12325ef2c16558354d1e8bb.jpg" alt="image" align="right">  But apparently <a href="http://www.theonlypage.com/">TheOnlyPage</a> did not attract attention, and on the <i>first day</i> , visitors to the stand had to be found on the sidelines of the conference.  As a result, I received a certain feedback from people with whom I have long wanted to discuss <a href="http://www.theonlypage.com/">TheOnlyPage</a> and the prospects for the development of this service. <br><br>  On the <i>second day,</i> startups went in an endless stream, there were a lot of people familiarizing themselves with the service and, to be honest, by the end of the second day I felt just like a squeezed lemon.  Perhaps, in this stream of interest, there was only one potential investor, but he was very well disguised. <br><br>  In general, the event is useful.  For myself for the future, I concluded that it is necessary to prepare for communication not only with investors, but also with start-up friends, to get acquainted with the participants' sites in advance.  And, of course, it was worthwhile to prepare some kind of advertising material about the service and distribute it to everyone. <br><br>  This year‚Äôs conference was very modest in everything.  And only glasses with white wine in the lobby reminded of the past gastronomic abundance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc5/cdd/5f9/fc5cdd5f9a1e1747aa006025c94f9a38.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/240147/">https://habr.com/ru/post/240147/</a></p>
