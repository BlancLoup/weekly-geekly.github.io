I have never been impressed with professional sales books.  They seemed to me very "scientifically" banal, too simplistic schematic and inflexible.  Thanks to this presentation of information in this area, I have always looked a bit down on the concept of ‚Äúsales‚Äù.  It seemed to be something that is lower than me and my aspirations. <br><br>  To some extent, sales are always a manipulation.  There is a product whose value is too high compared to the actual cost.  Therefore, it is important to have the ability to manipulate (control) the attention of a potential buyer to attract him to the purchase of this product. <br><br>  Over the past two years, I realized that I was wrong in my categorical about sales.  It turns out that everything I do is also for sale.  Everything that I was passionate about, everything that I created.  The sale of goods, my services, the sale of oneself occurs according to certain laws and rules in order to be successful in one‚Äôs business.

      Sometimes, it was necessary to manipulate.  Sometimes I sold the services too cheaply just because I wanted to get feedback on the service from the buyer. <br><br>  It was necessary to sell in order to pay salaries, pay rent bills, invest in development.  I was a little desperate, a little scared, but I really wanted to be sure that my plans were being successfully implemented. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We live in a complex world where our basic needs cost money.  And when a person becomes mature, he feels responsible for the basic needs of other people who depend on him. <br><br>  Someone makes their sales one day.  Professionals sell for life. <br><br>  Here are a few rules that I formulated for myself.  I made all these rules from my personal experience without using business literature, therefore, it is quite possible that they will not work for you.  I can not promise.  But I really want to share. <br><br>  I can say for sure that over the past two years I have been able to sell my services from creating new business ideas to developing websites and promoting them more than 60 million rubles.  Here are a few of my personal working rules: <br><br><h2>  Friendly relations </h2><br>  No one wants to buy from a person who does not cause sympathy and respect.  You should like your customers, and they should want to maintain friendly relations with you.  People pay for it to deal with a pleasant and conducive to long-term cooperation person. <br><br>  It sounds crazy enough, but it is.  At times, I hated myself most of all for having to sell my friendship as a prostitute to make money. <br><br>  One day, I came across a client whose company was on the verge of ruin.  I did not like it initially.  At our first meeting, he was too "straightforward" and said that I know my industry very poorly.  But I continued to call him every day, offering my services.  In the end, I made a lot of money thanks to this man. <br><br>  One day, I had to work with a large company to launch their product.  Employees of the company were very unorganized and slow, in their work there was a complete disorder and inconsistency.  All decisions were made for several days at the stage of formation of the contract.  In the end, we have a contract.  Definitely, I didn‚Äôt like these clients and their work style.  The project failed. <br><br>  Hate yourself.  I came across this almost every day.  When I say yes to something I don‚Äôt want to do.  In the end, I begin to hate myself for it, I hate the person who made me say ‚Äúyes‚Äù and do a bad job, disappointing everyone. <br><br>  I made a decision that I should never do this - to spend time and energy on failed projects and on unorganized and unsympathetic clients. <br><br>  Now I‚Äôm doing only those projects and interacting only with people that I initially like myself. <br><br>  The fastest way to lose all your money is to work with people who do not inspire you with trust or sympathy. <br><br>  This follows my second rule ... <br><br><h2>  Say no </h2><br>  When they want to conclude a contract with a large amount with you, it‚Äôs very hard to say no.  But the ability to say "no" is important for several reasons: <br><br>  <b>Alternative cost.</b>  Instead of doing what you don‚Äôt want to do without pleasure, you could free up your time and energy to find something that would be more interesting and profitable for you, that you would like more and be fulfilled by you with pleasure. <br><br>  Alternative cost is a priceless thing in any business. <br><br>  We miss it, as if the best tomorrow, in which one must always believe, does not come. <br><br>  <b>Supply and demand.</b>  If you reduce the offer, saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to everything that does not suit you personally, then the demand for you and your services increases, as well as your profit.  Plus, work brings more fun. <br><br>  <b>Recycling.</b>  If someone paid you 5,000 rubles and you return the same 5,000 rubles to him, this is a failure.  Most likely, you will never again deal with this client.  And it will be the right decision.  In some situations, further cooperation should be abandoned. <br><br>  But there is such a thing as "the prospect of interaction."  Suppose someone plans to pay you the amount of 5,000 rubles, and expects to receive services for 6,000 rubles.  There are circumstances and situations where you should think about this difference of 1 000 rubles, as a deposit that pays you interest. <br><br>  Once, I wanted to make a website for a network of fitness clubs in London (I don‚Äôt want to indicate the name).  I liked them to train in one of my trips.  The client found us himself.  He repeated again and again: ‚ÄúWe cannot afford much,‚Äù and I answered him: ‚ÄúDo not worry about it.‚Äù <br><br>  After all, it is easy to surpass anything when it is your passion! <br><br>  In the end, we made a website with a large number of individual design pages for each club for only $ 1,000.  Then, fitness centers from all over London began to turn to us with a large budget. <br><br>  Now I do a lot of projects done for free.  For any company that I like, I am ready to develop a design for free. <br><br>  For me, it's like a dream that becomes reality.  The benefits of this are always, perhaps, not always financial. <br><br>  The art of selling for me is more than meeting financial needs. <br><br>  People like to receive gifts.  Your recycling, in some cases, is a gift.  Giving and receiving gifts is always positive for any cooperation.  Come with a surplus, and you will acquire. <br><br><h2>  Never take no for a final answer. </h2><br>  This statement, which everyone knows, is usually applied incorrectly. <br><br>  People think what it means to keep up the pressure and try other ways of persuasion until you get a yes.  This is not true.  If you do this, you are blacklisted by the client. <br><br>  Instead, point 1) friendly relations works. <br><br>  Send periodic messages - updates to potential customers, so as not to lose contact after what they said no.  For example, how your business lives, how your services develop, what's new for you.  Not every day.  Maybe once a month.  Maybe once a year.  And who knows, in the end, you will find a joint ‚Äúyes‚Äù with this potential client.  This can happen in two years.  This happened to me repeatedly. <br><br>  Who knows?  You have planted a seed, and in the end, the garden will blossom. <br><br><h2>  Source of valuable information </h2><br>  Once I took part in a major competition for the development of a large corporate portal for a financial organization.  This company is well known in the financial world. <br><br>  At one point, the owner of this organization called me and asked: ‚ÄúWhat should I do?  In addition to your proposal, there is one more, no less interesting for us.  What choice will be the best in our case? ".  He described another sentence to me.  I advised him to choose another contractor, because the second option was more suitable for this company. <br><br>  In this case, it was important for me to maintain the trust of a respected partner, despite the fact that I would lose a large project budget.  Today, the owner of this company is my good friend. <br><br>  I am not sure that we expect joint projects in the future, but I cannot predict this future either.  But I know that I justified the trust of my partner, as a result, he got what was more profitable for him, and I can always count on his respect and support. <br>  Often the best way to make friends and customers for life is to send you a better service or product than yours at the moment. <br><br>  You need to be a source of valuable information, not a source of your ‚Äúproduct of the day.‚Äù  Then potential partners and clients will always be confident in you and will consider you a reliable and reliable source. <br><br>  Trust costs more than a project budget.  Trust creates a bridge that never wears out. <br><br><h2>  Be able to correctly sell everything </h2><br>  You offer not only your services, your offer - these are your employees, your experience, your ideas, your other clients and even (as mentioned above) your competitors. <br><br>  When you are well versed in the entire field of the services you offer, I am sure that people will appreciate this highly.  This is the top of the pyramid!  This evaluates the quality of the service you offer and your qualifications and competence. <br><br>  The main base of the pyramid is when you can give competent advice and share your experience.  Only then do you build real wealth, and do not receive a one-time service fee. <br><br>  Many say: ‚ÄúNo!  My services are so wonderful and the best!  I want to make money even when I sleep. ‚Äù <br><br>  In the long run, your service may not be needed by anyone.  Ultimately, it is important to your ability to serve the customer, your reliability and responsibility, and most importantly, full competence in the services offered. <br><br>  Otherwise, you can build a rather mediocre business.  The ability to serve the client will help you create true wealth. <br><br><h2>  Sell ‚Äã‚Äãa ‚Äúdream‚Äù rather than a service </h2><br>  People see what your service is right now, and not in the appendix to their ideas and expectations of the final result.  What they are interested in is the future.  Will the developed product bring them money? <br><br>  When you meet a client, do not offer your service directly to him, but offer a ‚Äúdream‚Äù.  People make a decision about your offer in just a few seconds.  The dream has infinite value.  Create images of your dreams.  Let the buyer's imagination take possession of the dream. <br><br><h2>  Part with the client </h2><br>  If communication with a client leaves a bad aftertaste, somewhere inside you, or the client has moved from the level of friends to the category of enemies, part with him.  No matter how, but break with him any ties, up to a full refund of money and other means, even at a loss. <br><br>  This applies not only to business and business relationships, but all parties and relationships in your life. <br><br>  A ‚Äúbad‚Äù client spreads like a disease inside you, your employees, your other clients, your competitors, your future clients and even your family.  Always break off relations with such people completely and without any regrets! <br><br><h2>  Welcome </h2><br>  Your best customers are your oldest and most reliable customers.  If you need to increase your profits, expand or build a new business, contact your customers (who are now not only your customers, they are your friends) and ask them: ‚ÄúI need advice.  What other service I can give you, that you would be interested to see and get new in my service or who you know who could be my potential client. ‚Äù <br><br>  Sometimes your client may need some help from you that is not related to the services you provide.  No problems.  Do it.  Your customer may be looking for a new idea or job.  Great, help, if possible, to find the right solution to his problems.  Now he is your customer for life. <br><br>  We have been building our ‚Äúperfect‚Äù business for years.  We plant seeds.  We care for the soil and water the plants. <br><br>  The sun shines, no matter what.  No matter what flower blooms.  The sun is always here, provides value every minute. <br><br>  Be the sun, and you will definitely get yours! <br><br>  I do not know the keywords to make a deal.  I do not go with clients to restaurants and concerts. <br><br>  But I sell for 10 years.  And whenever I am depressed and upset;  I pull myself together and sell each time more and more successfully. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/325864/">https://habr.com/ru/post/325864/</a></p>
