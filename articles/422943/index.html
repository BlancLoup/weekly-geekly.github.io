This topic is very popular now and many have tried to mine at home.  Industrial mining is noticeably different from home mining, if only because you have expenses that you never thought about at home.  In everyday life, it is rare to find private owners with capacities above 15 kW.  That is why we will consider the features of mining for farms with a consumption of over 15KW. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before you start mining, you should decide for yourself what to do with it.  There are two main options: <br><br><ul><li>  GPU mining on video cards. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ly/mg/km/lymgkmn95ntyudmo45p66itlunm.png"><br>  The most universal, you can mine any "currency", but because of the cost of video cards is very expensive.  Also, depending on the selected risers and video cards, periodic freeze is possible.

    <ul><li>  <a href="https://shop.nag.ru/catalog/00006.Servery/27988.Promyshlennyj-majning/27991.Antminer-S9">ASIC-</a> mining on special assemblies. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ra/lk/qo/ralkqomvb6biwmcotzbwkqa-guw.png"><br><br>  This option is tied to the mining of a specific group of "currencies", with the same algorithm.  This approach makes it impossible to choose a more profitable currency, but the price of the farm is significantly lower, moreover, it takes up less space. <br><br>  Some miners are afraid to choose ASIC, since the issue of its repair remains open.  Replacing a burned video card seems to the average person a simpler option. <br><br>  Basically, this problem concerns those who mine at home and have a small number of ASIC.  Since inside, the ASIC consists of several assemblies, the burned-out ASIC becomes an excellent donor for the repair of its fellows.  In addition, major suppliers can supply parts for repair separately.  Therefore, when working with a large number of devices for mining, there is no principal gain from the GPU in front of the ASIC, in terms of repair.  If we compare the performance, then one ASIC is approximately equal to a farm of 6 NVIDIA GTX 1070 or ATI RADEON RX 570 video cards. So, we will use the term Mining Unit (ME).  1 IU = 1 ASIC ~ 6 GPU <br><br>  The first thing you have to do is decide where your farm will be located.  You have three placement options: place the equipment in a third-party data center, mobile data center (MLC - farm made in a 10/20/40 foot container) or rent a room.  Each of the options has its pros and cons.  Briefly on each of the options. <br><br><h3>  Placement of equipment in the data center </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4w/vq/zp/4wvqzpwnvt2nt51fyxjqslwqhny.png"><br><br>  Speaking about the data center, we will keep in mind the professional data center with guaranteed power and access to the Internet, with a properly designed and designed cooling system, as well as security and fire suppression.  Otherwise, you can save a little on accommodation, but you will receive risks to ensure the uninterrupted operation of the equipment and its safety. <br><br>  Plus solution is that all questions on the protection, ventilation, electricity, etc.  immediately resolved.  You only need to monitor and periodic maintenance / repair. <br><br>  The disadvantage of this option is the cost of the service is quite high.  With current profits from one IU, the profitability will not exceed 15%. <br><br>  When choosing this solution, the level of readiness is maximum, you can install equipment and start working. <br><br>  Accommodation in MTSOD <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iu/0n/vg/iu0nvgzrafoumytbkdzbz0unyzk.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1d/jo/rb/1djorbto88honuttbsnvdvn_hda.png"><br><br>  Plus - the autonomy of the solution.  You can transport the farm to another region, where there is cheaper electricity or to a new site, if there are disagreements with the owner of the previous one.  A high degree of readiness - in the case of purchase of MTSOD, you immediately resolved the issue of fire suppression, ventilation and places for placement of equipment.  After 3-5 years, MTSOD will pay off, and due to savings on rent, your profit will increase slightly. <br><br>  Minus - high initial costs for the purchase of MTSOD, less, compared with the room, protection from theft. <br><br>  When choosing the MLC option, you will need to solve such questions as: <br><br><ul><li>  Placement of the container.  The place should have the ability to connect the required electricity. </li><li>  The ability to provide a reliable Internet connection. </li><li>  Ability to provide protection with a quick response time.  The weak point of the container is that you can drive up on a truck and after loading the container in 2-3 minutes, leave.  In this case, the guards, who arrive in 5-10 minutes, will find only an empty area. </li></ul><br><h3>  Room rental </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iz/f8/g0/izf8g0f0n3yvrcade6rhqdyoxlo.png"><br><br>  The benefits will depend on how well you manage to negotiate with the owner of the room.  The main plus is the ease of scaling, since finding a technical room less than 100m2 is hard.  And on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã100 square meters or more, you can easily place up to 1000 ASICs. <br><br>  Minus - you are tied to a specific place, and the owner of the premises, understanding this, likes to raise the cost of rent.  Low readiness, all aspects related to ensuring the operation of the equipment will need to be addressed.  Namely: <br><br><ul><li>  The choice of premises for rent.  In this case, it is necessary to take into account a number of requirements: </li><li>  The premises should be able to provide you with the necessary electrical power with a level of reliability of the first, or at least the second category.  Depending on the size of the farm, it can be from 20 to 1500 kW.  In this case, you need to have two independent inputs.  Given the amount of electricity consumption, to provide all this UPS for several hours is very expensive.  UPS can be 5-10 minutes to smooth the jumps.  So reliable electrical input is very important. </li><li>  The room should be away from residential buildings or have good sound insulation, as the noise from equipment and ventilation will be significant.  As an option, you can consider renting a technical floor, if you make good sound insulation. </li><li>  Organization of the ventilation system. </li><li>  The organization of the security system. </li><li>  Organization of fire extinguishing system.  Special attention should be paid to fire fighting, as we do not have electrical appliances and water to extinguish them.  If a former warehouse or workshop is used, and their area is significant, the gas fire extinguishing system will be ineffective. </li></ul><br>  After you have decided on the method of placement, you must decide who will look at everything: you yourself or a hired engineer.  It should be understood that when ME becomes dozens, something regularly breaks or hangs and you will not be able to look after the equipment from time to time.  The configured system of automatic reboot of equipment (Watchdog) will resolve the issue of lag, but the issue of repair and preventive maintenance will remain.  The more IU, the more often you will have to visit the equipment for maintenance.  After you collect information on prices for each of the options, you can calculate the planned profit and profitability, based on the current yield.  Then you can choose the most suitable option for you, based on the amount of the initial investment.  Also, not only the starting amount of IU will matter, but also the planned amount to which you want to develop your farm. <br><br>  Initial data to consider: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/wb/sp/10/wbsp10xm9xn0fco47bdtgfb3dx8.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q1/0-/0i/q10-0inhhde6jzvc-gtpxpxvoai.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ph/_t/fd/ph_tfdtr6zj0bdfndkbq7bviqp0.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/j3/ay/8s/j3ay8s2lzuuhom4avrey3xevab0.jpeg"><br><br>  As we see from the calculations, the option of renting a room is the most profitable, however, much will depend on the cost of preparing the room and the cost of rent.  This option should be considered when the number of IU from 100 pcs. <br><br>  Just want to note that these calculations are correct for the current complexity and cost of cryptocurrency.  Based on data from the beginning of 2018, the yield per IU falls on average by 2-3% per month.  Therefore, it is necessary to take this into account when forming the final business plan. <br><br>  Based on our calculations, it is clear that each of the options has its advantages, based on the number of IUs.  So, at the stage between home mining and 50 IU, the option with accommodation in a foreign data center is most suitable.  Between 50 and 100 MTSOD is beneficial.  After 100 - the most profitable it makes sense to consider the option of renting, but it is also the most labor-intensive. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/422943/">https://habr.com/ru/post/422943/</a></p>
