I even used q &amp; a, trying to decide: <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/478/">once</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/qa/477/">twice</a> , but I never received a final answer.  I had to conduct an independent study. <br><br>  I decided to share my modest research on this topic with the habrasoobschestvom.  They do not claim to inclusiveness.  But they can bring some clarity to the person who is going to choose cloudy \ vds-th hosting, but who has no idea about the market.

      Since I have not yet taken into account a whole heap of good hosting sites, I will be very grateful for the comments that will allow you to add to this list.  And also in view of the fact that I didn‚Äôt use almost any of the hosting servers listed below, I‚Äôll be happy to put first-hand reviews into the body of the article, if any are left in the comments. <br><br>  The list of mentioned hosting <a href="http://1gb.ru/">sites</a> : <a href="http://1gb.ru/">1gb.ru</a> , <a href="http://www.hostingrails.com/">Hostingrails</a> , <a href="http://www.rackspacecloud.com/">RackspaceCloud</a> , <a href="http://www.mediatemple.net/">Mediatemple</a> , <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> , <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a> (nodding), <a href="http://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a> (nodding), <a href="http://altnet.lv/ru/">Altnet</a> (greetings from Habrahabr), <a href="http://www.justhost.com/">justhost.com</a> (diarrhea rays), <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> , <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/">Hetzner online</a> ( <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D1%258B%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">highlighted server</a> ), <a href="http://www.server4you.com/">Server4you</a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  My initial requirements for hosting: <br><ul><li>  Ability to deploy a Rails 3 application </li><li>  In my application, there are several "robots" tied to cron, so cron is needed </li><li>  In the future, you will need to work with subdomains. </li><li>  SSL is useful </li><li>  Like any startup, I expect both an increase in attendance and peak high loads (such as habraeffect).  I want to hosting could easily withstand them.  Therefore, the sight is in the clouds. </li><li>  If possible, low price.  I am going to host two independent projects on rails 3. For one of them, almost no attendance is planned, the minimum price is among the possible ones.  But I am too lazy to understand the intricacies of the two hosting sites, so under two projects one hosting provider will be selected. </li><li>  Reliability, I want SLA and uptime 99.9% </li></ul><br><br>  Since foreign hosting is considered, the access time to their servers, both from the world and from Russia, becomes an essential criterion.  This parameter was estimated using the <a href="http://host-tracker.com/">host-tracker service</a> . <br>  Access time is the essence of the load time of the hosting home page without any extra weight (pictures, styles, scripts) from all possible servers.  Additive "in Russia" means from the data centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg (Ufa sometimes pops up there).  Additive "around the world" - from the data centers of the world (Europe, America mostly) <br><br>  It is clear that the criterion is not objective.  A lot of factors affect: page size (usually pennies), caching, load at this particular moment.  But, if the hoster did not optimize the main one, forgot to cache or did not balance the load, then what do we need it for the fig?  As for the page size, then, of course, as lucky.  Just in case, I write it in parentheses. <br><br>  To get a general idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe clouds, it is recommended to read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/scalaxy/blog/65228/">this article</a> and / or <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/webdev/75161/">this one</a> . <br><br><h4> <a href="http://1gb.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/877/90b/6b8/87790b6b8b4f3b5378e0d55989beb241.gif" alt="image"></a> </h4><br>  <a href="http://1gb.ru/">1gb.ru is</a> considered as a reference hosting.

The speed to Russia is amazing. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/en/hosting/produktmatrix/rootserver-produktmatrix-special/">Prices</a> : AMD Athlon 64 3700+, 1024 MB DDR400 RAM, 2 x 160 GB SATA HDD (Software-RAID 1) - 29 Euro per month <br><br>  On the topic of hosting turned the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hosting/104475/">controversy</a> . <br><br>  From arguments against: <br><blockquote>  ... These are not servers, but ordinary desktops, and those.  their support is ‚ÄúTajik‚Äù ... <br>  It works until the first little serious fall, not to mention the real performance of such systems, they are not even standing next to SAS.  Not to mention that their backup services are a separate line, and as a result, all the savings with a much lower quality leveled ... <br></blockquote><br>  From the arguments for: <br><blockquote>  But it works with a bang ... <br>  ... 100GB of backup is issued on request in the TP ... <br>  ... I‚Äôve been using hetzner for a long time, I‚Äôm happy with everything, the best price / quality ratio, the guys rent cool servers, I didn‚Äôt check personally about high load projects, but I think if you take three of them from the server and install them on one database, use another as an application server the third is for storing static data - they will withstand any effects without problems ... well, and at the prices their three servers will cost as rent 2 with us. <br></blockquote><br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/lord_daedra/" class="user_link">Lord_Daedra</a> <br><blockquote>  forgot to add one of the benefits of hetzner - there is a script that automatically allows you to reinstall the system <br><br>  It looks like this: <br>  1. go to the client's panel, choose server reboot from the network drive (free or Linux), say the password to the root <br>  2. you go by ssh, backup what you need from the disks, then you command the reinstallation (there is a mini-instruction there), we are asked what to put (debian / ubuntu / centos and like suse 64/32) the editor window opens, it specifies the hostname, sizes and type of partitions on disks and raid (I‚Äôll note about disks separately, you can choose whether or not to use lvm), save the file <br>  3. We look at how everything is formatted and installed after completion - we get a clean servachok (somehow, by analogy, you can, and fryshku, I have not tried) <br><br>  in fact, this is very cool because if something suddenly breaks in the system (hack, for example, or some kind of software failure occurs when updating packages (well, you never know)) or you get to set something up, but eventually you break , but there are backups of everything and everything (and most likely there are backups - after all, they give a place for backups on request without problems) - you can literally fix it yourself in an hour or two without the help of support ... <br><br>  Previously, one of the advantages of vps was that it was easy to reset it to its initial state, whereas the issue of reinstalling on Dedik was usually solved through support and this service is not always free ... <br><br>  that is, in hetzner, all this is really done from 3 at night until 6 in the morning, for example, no one will notice this simple one, in other data centers it may take a day <br></blockquote><br><br>  My conclusions: a dedicated server for the price of virtual without Russian support with an excellent channel to Russia. <br><br> <a href="http://www.server4you.com/"><img src="http://www.server4you.com/templates/images/header-logo.gif" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãtest (13 kb): <a href="http://host-tracker.com/check_res_ajx/5541726-0/">host-tracker.com/check_res_ajx/5541726-0</a> <br><br>  Russia - 0.65 seconds, World - 0.58 seconds <br><br>  On Habr√© was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/page1/%3Ftarget_type%3Dcomments%26q%3Dserver4you">discussed</a> and in the comments the German server4you hoster skipped. <br><br>  There are surprisingly chic <a href="http://www.server4you.com/vserver/vserver-vergleich.php%3Fproducts%3D0,1,2,3">prices on VDS</a> : 3 GHz, 1GB RAM, 25 GB - <b>$ 15</b> .  In my opinion, the cheapest offer that I saw.  Promise 24h uptime. <br><br>  Conclusions: a very cheap server with a decent channel to Russia and with reviews from habravchan. <br><br><h4>  My conclusions are common: </h4><br>  I think about either Rackspace (from $ 11) or Linode.  And never look towards justhost. <br><br>  There are a couple of recommendations in the comments, I recommend to read it. <br><br>  UPD: Added <a href="http://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> , <a href="http://www.hetzner.de/">Hetzner online</a> and <a href="http://www.server4you.com/">Server4you</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/104475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/104475/</a></p>
