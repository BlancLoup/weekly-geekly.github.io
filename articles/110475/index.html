      Also for all those present, Yuri Shkatula and Grigory Buteyko from the <a href="http://www.dataart.ru/">DataArt</a> studio during the report compared the <b>iPhone</b> and <b>Windows 7</b> mobile platforms.  The guys discussed the prospects for the development of mobile operating systems of IT giants, simultaneously catching on Android, with its significant drawbacks in the fight for a place under the sun. <br><br>  About this and much more under the cut. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We are very pleased that the meeting was attended by many people from <b>Habr</b> .  Young guys do not sit back and want to develop, which is good news.  For our part, we will try to help this in every way by organizing such meetings on a regular basis. <br><br><img src="http://img337.imageshack.us/img337/5418/98437688.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Let's go back to the meeting.  <b>Yury Shkatula</b> and <b>Grigory Buteyko were the</b> first to reach the <s>barrier</s> with a report on the opposition to the <b>iPhone</b> and <b>Windows 7 phone</b> . <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZD6e4AkSXGU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhglb913JVd-PkmsFONRXrmn8kcNMw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In fact, it all boiled down to the fact that a completely fresh brainchild of Microsoft on all sides was compared to iPhone, revealing its pros and cons.  As it turned out, <b>W7P has</b> very few advantages, especially as it is now (quite raw, many promises in the next versions). <br><br><img src="http://img213.imageshack.us/img213/8899/31895101.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Against the background of two giants, <b>Android</b> revealed several significant drawbacks.  The lack of uniform standards for devices becomes a real thorn for developers.  Different screen resolutions, different specifications, etc.  For the buyer, this is undoubtedly good in terms of budget, the price starts from $ 250, which allows you to buy a good machine for a little money.  But for developers, such a wealth of various characteristics leads to the fact that writing an application for one smartphone is far from a fact that it will run on another, even taking into account the same operating system. <br><br><img src="http://img529.imageshack.us/img529/2484/40349954.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Thus, ensuring the stable operation of the application on all available mobile devices, in half a year another ten devices will be released, on which the application will work crookedly or not run at all. <br><br>  By the way, <b>iOS</b> and <b>W7P</b> will not have such problems.  With "iPhone" everything is clear, and "Microsoft" for partners producing mobile phones with its operating system, imposes certain minimum system requirements and uniform standards for screen resolution and the number of buttons, thereby greatly facilitating the life of developers. <br><br>  Returning to the confrontation of the <b>iPhone</b> and <b>Phone 7,</b> I would like to express the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe guys.  Despite the lack of innovation and some legendary features, <b>Phone 7</b> will take its place in the market, as well as <b>Android</b> .  This is due to the fact that the market itself is very small and is able to accommodate many more operating systems, in addition to the others considered above (simbian, mayo, etc.).  When the <b>iPhone</b> ceases to be the main luxury for the overwhelming number of citizens, other flagships of its operating systems will stand next to it, which will contribute both to their development and to the development of the iPhone itself. <br><br><img src="http://img42.imageshack.us/img42/8157/87066507.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Having a lot of praise and answering questions from the audience, the guys finished their performance and during the coffee break showed everyone the possibilities of a <b>W7P-</b> based phone brought from abroad.  According to the general impression, people expected more from both the new NFS and the entire OS. <br><br><img src="http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/2892/27213279.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Having rested from an interesting and rich report, all those present were divided into three master classes. <br><br><h4>  Windows Phone Development </h4><br>  <b>Anton Maximov</b> from the <a href="http://www.e-legion.com/">e-Legion</a> company told and demonstrated to all those gathered how to create their own application for this promising platform. <br><br><img src="http://img91.imageshack.us/img91/7691/98681193.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The conditions put forward by <b>Microsoft are</b> very beneficial for those who are able and willing to write commercial applications.  It is expected that sales of these phones will grow rapidly, which means that sales of applications will also grow - it is very important not to miss your chance at this moment. <br><br><h4>  HTML5 iPhone Development </h4><br>  <b>Ivan Chashkin</b> from ‚Äú <a href="http://zenmoney.ru/">Zen Money</a> ‚Äù during his master class immediately explained that to work with the iPhone it is not necessary to have a Mac and write in Objective C. <br><br><img src="http://img833.imageshack.us/img833/3528/76974589.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Zen Mani application - the master case of the master class - is written in JavaScript.  The application could be designed and tested using an <b>iPhone</b> , <b>iPad</b> or via <b>Safari</b> right on the master class. <br><br><h4>  IPhone Development </h4><br>  Alexander Cherny from Mikhail Kechinov Studios talked about the development on Object C. He was counting on an audience of novice programmers who had an idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãObjective C. Together with Alexander, those who wanted could construct a simple toy in XCode and iOS SDK. <br><br><img src="http://img155.imageshack.us/img155/9918/40351605.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Successful <b>iPhone apps</b> hosted on the <b>AppStore</b> can be very profitable for authors.  To do this, you need to be able to develop and ‚Äúget into the jet,‚Äù having guessed the mood of future buyers. <br><br>  At the end of the master classes, we handed out the sheets and asked to rate the speakers and the value of the information. <br><br><img src="http://img10.imageshack.us/img10/6088/60546877.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  On the basis of the data obtained, it can be concluded that the participants highly appreciated the level of training of the speakers, and the information obtained will serve as a foundation for further development. <br><br>  We are pleased that in Petersburg we have like-minded people who support our main idea - the development of skills and skills of developers for the iPhone and other worthy platforms.  Our monthly meetings are aimed at gaining practical knowledge and working out business connections.  The next meeting is expected in mid-January.  We welcome your feedback, we will try to take them into account when planning the next ADC meetings. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110475/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110475/</a></p>
