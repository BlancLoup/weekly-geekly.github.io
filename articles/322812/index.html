      In dreams, many people want not just to get rich, but to become Linus Torvalds or Richard Stallman and create a solution for themselves that will be used by millions of people.  But superstars in the technology world could not have achieved such heights without large teams of professionals, hundreds of people took part in creating the same Linux.  Another dream of a good life is connected with Silicon Valley.  But today, only 8% of all US programmers <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job/">work</a> there (imagine how much this figure will be less globally). <br><br>  The world has changed, and today the need for <a href="http://paulgraham.com/95.html">ordinary</a> programmers who support a huge infrastructure is constantly growing.  Each company has become <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/01/23/why-every-company-is-a-technology-company/">associated</a> with technology, no matter what products or services it produces.  Therefore, the real heroes sit in ordinary offices and make the work of all these companies in completely different fields possible. <br><br><h2>  Learn at school? </h2><br>  Today, in order to become a hero (or a programmer), it is not necessary <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2912410/developer/do-programmers-need-a-degree-in-computer-science.html">to study</a> at a university for many years: 2 out of 3 <a href="https://qz.com/649409/two-out-of-three-developers-are-self-taught-and-other-trends-from-a-survey-of-56033-developers/">developers</a> (according to the results of another study, <a href="https://thenextweb.com/insider/2016/04/23/dont-need-go-college-anymore-programmer">half</a> ) are self-taught.  The younger generation learns to program from school, sometimes even from <a href="http://www.straitstimes.com/tech/coding-classes-for-kids-in-high-demand">primary</a> school.  Some countries even include programming <a href="http://legroup.aalto.fi/2015/11/coding-in-school-finland-takes-lead-in-europe/">included</a> in the compulsory school curriculum, such as Finland. <br><br>  But the number of developers is increasing not only due to graduates of schools and universities.  In this area come people who earn a living in a completely different work.  An interesting <a href="https://backchannel.com/canary-in-the-code-mine-903884eca853">trend has emerged</a> in the United States: programming is becoming a new activity for former miners. <br><br>  The number of mines is reduced, and many workers lose their earnings.  At the same time, it is very difficult to find a replacement with a middle class wage for adult men.  When this happened to Rusty Justice, who had worked all his life in coal mining, he decided not to give up.  He realized the main advantage of working in IT: a programmer, unlike a miner, does not have to physically be close to his place of work. <br><br>  He decided that it was quite realistic to retrain the miners to coders, since many of them were technical specialists, operators and engineers.  And he turned out to be right: there was a huge demand for his courses, and many hard workers gained a new profession.  This led to the fact that programmers were called the new <a href="https://www.wired.com/2017/02/programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job/">"blue</a> collars."  In a world that depends on technology, it is programmers who become the main workforce, since without such hard workers no company can function. <br><br>  In this case, even the age of the pupils is not important.  For example, in 2013, a program was launched to <a href="http://wesleytansey.com/retraining-baby-boomers-to-be-programmers-in-6-months/">retrain</a> coders for the generation of baby boomers.  For many, care in programming becomes quite a <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/ac5afa80-3ce6-11e5-8613-07d16aad2152">conscious</a> decision at an earlier age. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b
