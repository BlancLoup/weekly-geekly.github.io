WhatsApp initially also did not collect from users on the dollar per year.  For companies, free versions of successful products (and their subsequent monetization) are always a struggle.  Developers rejoice, sales managers write resignation statements. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  The joy of the developers </h2><br>  Three months ago we decided to release a free version of one of our products - a callback system for <a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect</a> sites.  A little more than a week ago we launched it - and already in the first three days we received several hundred new registrations.  The development department is happy.  When new products are distributed to thousands of users - it is very inspiring.  The development of free versions is always conducted with a double interest.  Everyone is well aware that the audience will definitely be very large.

      A few years ago, when we first started, there was something free in all our products.  We were very encouraged that products are actively used.  The question of making money was in the tenth place, and the main motivating factor was the monitor with online user graphs. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt know a better way to rally a start-up startup team than to offer it to work on something free that many people might be interested in.  In addition, the popularity of the product (let it free) motivates investors as well.  When the schedule of operators using our free chat site broke the mark of 5,000 users, the investors themselves began to make appointments for us.  At all conferences, I began the presentation with the words that at this very moment thousands of operators communicate with clients on our servers.  The attention of the audience after that was guaranteed to me. <br><br>  For the team that has been working in the company for a long time, launching the free version is a great opportunity to raise the independence of each developer and save it until the moment when you need to solve routine tasks (such as fixing bugs or refining minor functions and so on).  Working on something free is a great time to identify senior developers and executives.  While you are doing the free version, it's easier for you to form a team.  Until now, in interviews with the development department, we show applicants the popularity and high workload of the system - these numbers are becoming one of the main reasons why strong experts decide to work with us. <br><br><h2>  Sales Experience </h2><br>  With the sales department is much more complicated.  The commercial service looks at the free product with hostility and even aggressively.  When we announced that we were starting to develop the free version of <a href="http://redconnect.ru/">RedConnect</a> , one of our most successful sellers wrote a letter of resignation a couple of days later (after a week he, fortunately, took it away). <br><br>  A sales manager sees an enemy in a person who offers the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa free version.  Yes, it can be explained that this will ultimately help to increase the number of applications (and in the end, most likely, will increase sales), but now the manager every day will have to hear from the customers the most terrible words for him: ‚ÄúWe have enough free version‚Äù. <br><br>  The free version is a strong competitor we create ourselves.  The best thing you can do to prevent conflict is to say it honestly.  Yes, this is a competitor with which we have to compete, but we will be able to influence its development, and this gives a good chance of success.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãeducating a controlled enemy, which we will be able to win regularly, testing ourselves in this way for strength, the sales department perceives well.  It should take several months before the sales department is completely reconstructed. <br><br>  The main change that must occur in the minds of sales managers is the emergence of a habit not only to take, but also to give.  It's hard, but in the long run your employees will become stronger.  ‚ÄúIf you don‚Äôt like our full version, we will be able to offer you a free product - it has main functions‚Äù - the need to pronounce this phrase only for the first time will knock the ground out from under the manager.  Previously, he simply had to put pressure on the client, scaring the imminent termination of the license, now he will have to learn how to build a dialogue with the help of less obvious arguments. <br><br>  Anton Chernyatin, CEO of RedHelper </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296432/</a></p>
