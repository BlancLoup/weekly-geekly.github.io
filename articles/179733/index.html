  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How i was point</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I saw the computer for the first time in 1988.  Then all my communication was reduced to games.  Since  I played on the work computer of my native uncle, then the toys were sometimes removed or moved by someone from detractors, most likely by the authorities.  Therefore, I had to learn the basics of the user interface to find and hide toys.  By the time of graduation and before entering the institute, I already knew in which direction I would work.  Around 98-99, I first heard about Fido.  Friends scared me with scary rules when, because of the joint of one point, the whole note was transferred to the RO for months.  A friend also talked about terrible bosses.  These are not some kind of bosses at the end of toys, which you have to kill for a long time with your last strength.  These need a whole evening to appease from the last forces of his wallet, by introducing into their bodies doses of alcohol incompatible with life.  And then, on the verge of consciousness, at the last moment before going into a state of two-day coma, the boss's dying mind will give the last command.  From his mouth, as if on the last breath, a barely perceptible whisper will erupt.  We must catch this moment, learn Zen, detach ourselves from the whole world and listen.  And in silence you will hear a whisper, uttering cherished numbers.  Do not forget them, do not miss them.  After the coma, the boss may not repeat them.  Flashed - so blinked.  When he comes out of the coma, he will remember these numbers, they will burn him from the inside until he writes them in his configs.  And the point during his coma has time to configure all the software.  Many bosses do not help their points with setting up software, allowing the natural evolutionary process to cut off the most mediocre from Fido.  Frightened to the depths of my soul, I went to get acquainted with his boss. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I don‚Äôt remember exactly how old I was, 17 or 19, but it turned out that the boss is not a bloodthirsty, overgrown old man who rapes innocent girls with a terrible laugh, and then drinks all their blood.  It was a bit overgrown, young and cultured IT specialist in the most "classic" of his presentation: a beard, a sweater, glasses, red eyes, IT slang.  Much later, I saw his slightly ‚Äúimagined‚Äù photo on the Internet, on which practically nothing is exaggerated: <br><br><img src="http://www.malomice.org/artykuly/malomiceorg_poroku/images/1.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br>  He introduced himself simply "Glitch."  Other ‚Äúcall signs‚Äù didn‚Äôt respond fundamentally even at work, therefore very few people knew that his name was Galitsky Alexander Vasilievich on his passport.  We went to the pub, where he really hit me with the possibility of absorbing beer.  With his weight less than 70 kg, he also used my ‚Äúentry fees‚Äù and from 3-4 grateful points ‚Äúmembership fees‚Äù.  In total, it turned out 10 liters. It was beyond my comprehension.  WHERE???  He turned out to be an interesting and very cheerful, erudite interlocutor.  He confirmed that he does not tolerate lamers, so no requests from friends and acquaintances will help the lamer to become his point.  Only after his oral ‚Äútest‚Äù did I receive the cherished numbers 2: 5055 / 115.5 and the next day, having got a box of beer, they sat down with another point to set up the software.  There were many settings, even more incomprehensible settings.  ‚ÄúNaked grandfather‚Äù (it seems 3.0) slightly impressed me with the richness of designs in the spirit of dos navigator.  Set up a bunch of batch files to compress mail when exiting gold and quickly connecting with the boss, exchanging mail, etc.  Almost all newbies make textbook mistakes, such as ‚Äúhello, dear areafix ...‚Äù.  My mistake was that I listened to my friend-point and entered the command to the + * and started the key combination to send mail.  For some reason, my friend choked on beer and cleared my throat, my eyes wide with horror, watched how my USR Sportster (aka sprat) cheerfully connected with the boss.  The connection took a few seconds.  When my friend was able to talk, he said in an extinct voice.  ‚ÄúWhat are you doing, this is a classic joke!  So DO NOT DO IT. ‚Äù  In the next couple of hours I could not connect with the boss, he was busy.  A couple of hours later, in two rounds, I received 6 or 7 megabytes, which swung for more than an hour.  Suddenly, the data transfer stopped and a sincere melodic cry ‚Äúpick up the phone, with $ &amp; #!‚Äù Came from the modem.  I grabbed a paired phone and computer terms mixed with navy and military men poured over my wounds with balsam.  In short, my boss explained that such actions are not welcome.  If the list of "eh" does not decrease, then its node will only work for me, receiving mail from uplink half a day, giving me the second half of the day.  After that, he was quite friendly invited to the nearest rifle.  On Friday evening, we met with him and went in the direction of the Gorky library, where the collections are going.  It was around the end of November, and it rained on the street with snow.  I <br>  he doubted that in such weather there would be people willing to drink beer on the street.  My boss reassured that this was garbage and at -30 I had to tusil for several hours.  We came closer and saw 2 groups of people, 60 people each, standing at a distance of several meters from each other and looking at their neighbors rather hostilely.  A familiar chill ran down the back, causing the "buns" and fists to shrink reflexively. <br>  - It is planned to fight, I asked. <br>  - No, it's just that the <b>interpreted ones</b> are <b>just</b> gathering <b>here</b> , see not to be confused.  Ours on the right, their left.  They often interfere with each other, but they have never reached a massacre yet.

      We approached "our" group, which, as it turned out, consisted of smaller groups.  And people constantly traveled from one to another.  You come up with a beer, say hello, call the name-number and you are already yours.  People gathered there extremely extraordinary, enthusiastic and talented.  Such a number of talents per square meter can not be found even in Skolkovo.  Everything is busy, general trips, hobbies, projects.  Life on pointovke raged, sometimes overflowing over the edge. <br><br>  Gradually, I became involved in Fido, a lot of time passed there.  I have never met so many professionals on any Internet forum who are ready to help and really help with advice.  On Habr√© and most technical forums, the question on IT shnuyu topic attracts a huge number of trolls competing in wit.  In the midst of this clowning, a real professional appears from time to time, who can often solve your problem in one sentence.  Then, about a year later, he discovered fahs and gates on the Internet.  The speed of a bad dialup connection was missed.  19200 is the speed that I saw only on holidays.  Usually, above 14400, 12200 or 9600 did not rise.  For downloading this file was very small.  Then I "otmutil" IRISH USR Courier.  This is not a "red" and not a "yellow" assembly, so popular in the late 90s.  This is the ‚Äúwhitest‚Äù of all the ‚Äúwhite‚Äù assemblies.  The boss at the time was also "white", but Canadian production, which was quoted a little less.  There were 2 distinctive signs: the inscription ‚Äúmade in ...‚Äù on the bottom cover of the modem and the ‚Äúlabel‚Äù on the front panel.  The Canadian one was painted simply with paint, the Irish one was convex, made of individual pasted plastic letters.  By convincing "I am the boss, I need more" and pouring large amounts of beer into me already, an exchange was made.  The first pleasant sign of the upgrade was the HST connection.  It was half duplex, but the link kept stable at 16k.  Merry nights began when I adjusted the modem to the line with the instructions for the AT commands.  Reinforced, reduced the signal and the ratio of the receiving amplifier.  I compiled the tables snr, db, far echo, near echo, deriving from them the values ‚Äã‚Äãthat would allow me to maintain stable connection with my boss.  After some time I got hold of a twisted pair, which laid the "last meter" from the shield in the stairwell to the modem.  Another 3 days set up a modem under the new conditions and received in the end a stable 32k.  Yes, yes, from HST immediately to V.34 bis!  It was nirvana. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/179733/">https://habr.com/ru/post/179733/</a></p>
