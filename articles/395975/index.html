And then the authorities kindly decided to finance this initiative for everyone, and <s>instead of working</s> after work, we, with knowledgeable colleagues, began to discuss the necessary characteristics of a two-wheeled friend.  The choice fell on the <a href="http://www.pegasus-bikes.de/fahrraeder-e-bikes/show/tecaro-e8-f/">Pegasus Tecaro E8 of the</a> German company Pegasus, which has been on the market for more than 30 years. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/765/2a3/5da/7652a35da11fbd2a3ffafabcc67444a8.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Since I am a beginner cycling driver and, I confess, the scarecrow‚Äôs distance and the option of using an electric train were not discarded at all, the choice of configuration was appropriate: everything should work out of the box, minimum maintenance costs, maximum convenience.  What was the result?  The box arrived big, with the bike already assembled, it remains only to turn / raise the steering wheel, fasten the pedals and you could go.

      Very unsuccessfully right after ordering a bicycle, I caught a cold and the purchase waited for me at work for three whole days.  Having arrived at the office for business, I unpacked the bike at the same time and decided to ride to the nearest station ... And then I changed my mind and increased the distance to the second station, and there I decided to go home on it immediately, and then ride a little more and a little bit because riding this iron horse is a pleasure.  As a result, after the first trip on the on-board computer, 36 km were shone, instead of 3 planned.  But let's not get ahead. <br><br>  The set included, besides the bike itself, a Bosch 4A charger, a bunch of manuals and keys to the <a href="http://www.axasecurity.com/bike-security/de-de/produkte/schloesser/rahmenschloesser/axa-victory-abz-schluessel-schwarz/">AXA anti-theft lock</a> , which also went to the battery lock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f8/f72/b3f/8f8f72b3f1b84db882849da93dd975ef.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d18/959/964/d1895996407e4226b554c781e16942d0.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/115/573/6bd/1155736bda114a9e9a0e83cb94d1d552.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f3d/ccf/9ba/f3dccf9ba6dc496f94543ea689fc71a9.jpg"><br><br>  The weight of the whole structure is about 25 kg, the weight of the battery is about 4 kg.  Aluminum frame with a rigid fork (I did not specifically take with shock absorbers, because I do not see sense in them at my weight). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a67/737/813/a67737813154432ea7368c1b2cbcc4ee.jpg"><br>  <i>Convenient mounting bags and baskets on the trunk is also included :)</i> <br><br>  <b>Disc brakes.</b>  Another contender for the role of the iron horse was the <a href="http://www.bergamont.com/ru_ru/bikes/archive/2015/e-line-c-n360-harmony-gent/">Bergamont E-Line C N360</a> , but alas, he did not have disc brakes, and the models with them did not fit my budget.  Hydraulic disc brakes <b>Shimano BR-M447</b> perfectly hold the load and do their job, especially since the electric motor helps them, braking reversely.  A really reliable reinforced casing protects the cables from damage, and the frame itself has channels inside so that the cables do not interfere with the cyclist. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/235/92d/79c/23592d79c8524358a2e677a94b8612e4.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09e/3b1/620/09e3b162090d4945b5282cd558722e32.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/51f/6cd/0be/51f6cd0beacb47728d1b5681215c8d5f.jpg"><br><br>  <b>A belt, instead of a chain.</b>  Why belt?  As I wrote above, the task was minimal maintenance during operation and the ability to use public transport without problems, and the belt in this case is best suited because it does not need to be lubricated, it does not creak and does not get dirty. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/049/035/c56/049035c56e314a4b89dc975ffba8e263.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/23c/5ee/217/23c5ee21700d45f188c0f40e122c7072.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/412/a98/2ef/412a982ef77646318d50ef23e9433086.jpg"><br><br>  Transmission.  Shimano Nexus 8-Gang Planetary Sleeve.  She has many advantages, in my opinion, in front of classic bicycle gearboxes: <br>  - One gear switch on the steering wheel, which is very convenient to go to the hand and easily and smoothly allows you to switch speeds both down and up.  True, down switches a little easier; <br>  - Setting is needed only once, unlike bicycles equipped with a drag driver, and no more attention will be required.  And Nexus bushings are also equipped with yellow marks.  To adjust, you need to enable fourth gear and align the labels; <br>  - Plus, it is completely sealed and almost silent.  The Nexus 8 gear range 306% is more than enough to drive around the city, and considering that this is a bicycle with an electric motor, then almost any lift becomes affordable; <br>  - A nice bonus is the ability to leave people on sports bikes far behind at traffic lights. <br><br>  <b>Engine Bosch Active Line</b> .  So we got to the very heart of our iron horse. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a77/7fb/6f2/a777fb6f22364f16a6cab1052e28eda5.jpg"><br><br>  It has a power of 250W, which is enough for a very comfortable ride through the city and rough terrain. <br>  4 modes of operation (Eco, Tour, Sport, Tubro) provide, respectively, 40%, 100%, 150%, 225% pedal enhancement.  You can drive it from 45-190 Km, depending on the mode on the 400 Watt battery and up to 210 on the 500 Watt.  Also, it provides reverse braking up to 5 km / h. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8d5/dc6/0b4/8d5dc60b43c042118742f81e6acf3683.jpg"><br><br>  According to European laws, the maximum speed at which it stops working is limited to 25 km / h, but this can be solved by a <s>programmer with a</s> chip embedded in the engine, however, this pleasure costs about 150 euros.  From personal experience, I can say that I use something higher than the Tour only at the start, if I need to reach the maximum speed, after it is quite comfortable to roll on the Eco / Tour. <br><br>  The on-board computer is not very informative, but displays all the necessary information: <br><br>  Battery charge, engine operation, mileage, current speed, maximum speed, average speed, calculation of the distance that you can still go on the current charge. <br><br>  From the buttons are available on the instrument itself.  The power button of the computer and the engine, the light (backlight, front and rear lights), screen switching and resetting information. On the steering wheel is the engine mode switch, which allows you to quickly and conveniently switch from Eco to Sport at the start. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee5/393/dbe/ee5393dbe2084d169bffe2ae4b6e098d.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/967/e7d/883/967e7d88378f454fb030772cbaacd556.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Battery</b>  I have a 400Wh model (Li-Ion, 11 Ah, 36V), which is fully charged in 2.5 hours, and 50% in 1.5 hours.  For charging using a proprietary charger 4A 36V.  Models for 500Wh at that time were not on sale in the place where I bought the bike, but on the other hand, the difference of 30 kilometers and an increase in charge for an hour did not cost the 200 euros that were asked to pay for it. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  Perhaps enough dry numbers and other things.  I will try to tell objectively what a person feels when riding such a bike.  The first is, of course, freedom.  You can go anywhere and as anywhere, while I have reduced the time spent on the road.  On the other hand, with this money it is quite possible to buy a car or a scooter and still remain on change.  Secondly, this is still a problem of storage and security, which is quite acute, since bicycles are stolen everywhere, and even more so, which can be quickly sold and relatively expensive.  Yes, a good lock is excellent, but the wheels can be dragged off, or they can be simply broken, so everything is very ambiguous here.  Third, it is a question of health and active recreation, which is especially necessary for us, people who spend a lot of time in a sitting position.  Does he decide it?  Not sure, because driving 20 kilometers I don‚Äôt even sweat, but my muscles ache, so this is very controversial. <br><br>  In the bottom line, I can tell you for sure, this is a great bike, the happiness of riding on which you will feel as soon as you start pedaling and you don‚Äôt want to get off of it, even if you have already reached your goal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395975/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395975/</a></p>
