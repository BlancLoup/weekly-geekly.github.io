The nature of power allows a considerable variety of mechanisms, forms and shades, while always leaving loopholes for the continuity of the phenomenon itself.  Is there a big difference - to get 10 years for a joke about the Immortal (during the dictatorship of the proletariat) or for the hentai on the hard disk (during the times of liberal democracy)?  Of course, this question implies a certain generalization and is essentially rhetorical.  However, after observing the course of the history of various countries, you will find that the most wonderful and beautiful form of public administration is being replaced by an even more beautiful and humane one.  At least, it is considered so until the next changes it.  Thus, in whatever era you find yourself in a particular territory, you will certainly fall into the best of all existing worlds.  This amazing in its universality property of the present pushes us to an even greater generalization, compared to which the previous one seems like an innocent joke.  However, I will not deny that such conclusions can easily lead us to fragile soils, where conspiracy theories grow and flourish. <br><br>  Petr Viktorovich drank nectar in small, frequent sips.  Stretching out his proboscis and waving rhythmically with iridescent lemon-lemon wings, he thrust him into the very depths of the flower and with ecstasy he drew in himself the fragrant ambrosia.  It was a wonderful summer day, the sky from horizon to horizon shone with purity, as it had been from the previous evening, and the hydrometeorological center predicted.  Neither rain nor simple wind was foreseen, which sometimes complicated not only pollination, but also marriage games, blowing the dancing couples away from sources of illumination with their impulses.  Summer has turned out to be wonderful - hot and sunny.  From time to time looking around the surroundings with her faceted eyes, Peter Viktorovich admired the endless meadow, dotted with wild flowers here and there.  Many hundreds of friends and girlfriends fluttered tirelessly over the meadow, whose wings, to match the colors, were painted with the most delicate and bizarre shades.  It is enough to sit on a blade of grass and stand still - neither a bird, nor a dragonfly will ever distinguish it from an innocent flower.  But dragonflies, like birds, have long been transferred to these places, and spiders will not be remembered by night, for several years now they are rejected to the very edge of the forest and do not dare show themselves in open space, especially during the day. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Satisfied, Peter Viktorovich turned the proboscis and sat down on a leaf, gracefully spreading his wings to the sides and intending to bask in the sun after a pleasant lunch.  However, the siesta was short-lived, and soon his loneliness was broken by two swallowtails <i>(Papilio machaon)</i> , who, having planned, sat down on the nearest stalk.

      <br>
      - Good day!  - greeted Peter Viktorovich one of the strangers.  - We are to you upon request from the political department. <br><br>  Hearing the last words, Pyotr Viktorovich wanted to wash the front legs together, but he came to his senses in time and politely introduced himself.  It soon became clear that the swallowtails from the political department were well known not only for his name and patronymic, but also for some other details of the biography.  For example, they knew for certain that Petr Viktorovich had not only managed to hand over the current standard of nectar to the Support Bank, but was also considered one of the leaders in delivering nectar in his region, and therefore enjoyed the well-deserved respect of his comrades. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThat is why, my dear, we wanted to invite you for a private, so to speak, consultation in the rose garden,‚Äù said one of the swindlers, apparently the former for the elder.  - If it does not bother you, it would be advisable to go there immediately. <br><br>  Having said this, he cheerfully raised his belly, thus making it clear that he was ready to go at once.  Obviously, there were no objections, so after 40 minutes of flying, Pyotr Viktorovich found himself in a rose garden for the first time in his life. <br><br>  Rosary called thickets of wild roses in the center of the meadow.  Makhaons roared here, and peacock-eyes <i>(Saturniidae)</i> flew in whole squads to patrol the outskirts of the meadow.  Even the greenest caterpillar was aware that nondescript peacock eyes, though they do not collect nectar on their own, but perform an important function - they scare away birds and spiders.  Small specks on the wings remind the enemy of the eyes of predatory mammals and force it to run without looking back.  A squadron of peacock eyes is capable of driving spiders to the farthest holes for a long time and throwing its web into the will of wind and rain.  As practice has shown, this method was extremely effective and, importantly, humane.  It was on their tireless work that universal well-being was built.  Ordinary butterflies, cabbages and limonnitsy, happily donated a small amount of nectar collected per day for the needs of their caregivers. <br><br>  Swallowtails felt much more confident in the rose garden than their ward.  Having made several difficult turns, they sat down on one of the leaves, closer to the stalk, and then folded their wings, inviting Peter Viktorovich to follow their example, which he did on the second or third attempt.  Sitting down and folding his wings, he noticed a third butterfly, which sat at the cutting itself, spreading its wings and almost completely merging with the surface.  She had a little peacock eye.  Noticing her gaze, she folded and immediately spread her wings again. <br><br>  - Hello dear!  - greeted his peacock.  - My name is Arkady Kharitonovich, I supervise your part of the meadow.  You were invited here on my instructions.  We have learned that you are one of the most conscientious nectar collectors, a connoisseur of the area, and all your friends appreciate your abilities.  Given this, I believe, it is quite obvious that we decided to single out you and ask for help in matters of national importance. <br><br>  Pyotr Viktorovich, pleading with pleasure, politely spread his wings to the sides, making it clear that the whole had turned into a rumor. <br><br>  - So, - continued Arkady Kharitonovich, slowly turning over the front paws.  - You should be aware that collecting nectar is extremely important and that it is not going to anyhow.  Nectar should be varied to ensure well-being and the full development of each butterfly.  And for this to happen, it is necessary that all types of flowers in the meadow be approximately equal amounts.  Therefore, it is necessary to pollinate primarily those flowers that are in the minority.  And those that are in the majority, leave for later or completely ignore when collecting.  Given the significant diversity and uneven growth in different parts of the meadow, control over this process becomes a very difficult task.  Do you follow my thought? <br><br>  Pyotr Viktorovich knew all this very well, and so he got a little distracted by a dewdrop hanging from the top sheet, but when he heard the question, he started, quickly pulled back and spread his wings again, showing attention. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThat is why we have to write and distribute flight sheets to every butterfly of our meadow every day,‚Äù continued Arkady Kharitonovich.  - This work is not easy, it requires knowledge of the area, attention and imposes a special responsibility.  I hope you understand that it is as important as it is honorable? <br><br>  Petr Viktorovich immediately nodded, with his whole appearance portraying the utter agreement with this thesis. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThat's wonderful,‚Äù said Arkady Kharitonovich and brought his front paws together.  - We believe you will cope with it in the best way.  From this moment you are transferred to the department of systematization and accounting.  Congratulations.  Consider it a promotion. <br><br>  The department of systematization and accounting turned out to be a small space among the wrinkled grass at the base of the rose bush, densely populated by the workers of the department itself and the cobweb pulled from above.  The web was not the most unpleasant surprise.  As explained to Peter Viktorovich, it was intended solely for the protection of important employees from a potential adversary.  Although it was not recommended to touch it, the spider serving the network did not represent a direct threat to it.  Worse, the wings were supposed to pass when appointed to this post.  They were sawed off by two two swallowtails who conducted it to the place of future work, which brought him to the rose garden.  Frustrations paid off with bonuses in the form of honor, respect and awareness of the importance of the work.  In addition, the department perfectly fed.  All kinds of nectar, even those that could be obtained only in the most remote corners of the meadow and therefore considered delicacies, were available at any time and in any quantity.  Bank of Support provided a full lifetime guesthouse, and it was beautiful.  It was not necessary to fly and collect nectar on their own, it was not necessary to sit on an empty stomach during rain or wind.  It was enough just to go to the dispenser and immediately get what you want.  The work itself was not difficult, the number of employees was quite large, and each accounted for only about a dozen or a half flight sheets requiring filling.  The staff were solid, overfilled butterflies, mostly from the moth family <i>(Pieridae)</i> .  All of them were extremely proud and satisfied with their position.  What in the end can be more worthy than devoting your whole life to working for the good of society?  Moreover, this work distinguishes them from the motley mass of simple workers, for whose well-being they have to do this work.  In addition to the noble distinctive sign, the absence of wings made it possible to comfortably accommodate all employees in a relatively compact area.  Of course, the trapping network, which tightened the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe department at the height of unapproved grass, confused at first.  But after a while they got used to it so much that they stopped paying attention at all.  Moreover, in the fashion game was a jumper, the essence of which was to jump higher than the others, while, of course, without touching the network. <br><br>  Newcomers to skipjack usually didn‚Äôt play, as those who managed to gain too much weight for high jumps didn‚Äôt play it either.  However, some time later, his colleagues began to subordinate Peter Viktorovich, and once in passing he was reproached with excessive caution, which was too much.  It was necessary to prove to everyone that he is no worse than others.  It was not necessary to win for this, but Petr Viktorovich was eager to prove that his appointment was not an accident.  Therefore, and also because he was completely unwilling to repeat this experience, he firmly decided to win.  He did not understand how he managed to jump so high that he caught one of the legs on the trapping net.  Vlip, thought Pyotr Viktorovich.  He tried to free himself, twitching his whole body, but the cobweb spun down, and another paw fell into it.  ‚ÄúCalmness,‚Äù thought Pyotr Viktorovich, ‚Äúthe main thing is calmness.  You need to free yourself, methodically swinging, and then at the lowest point sharply pull the paws, pressing them to him. ‚Äù  The plan was bound to work, and he began to gently swing up and down.  But when the amplitude grew enough for a saving jerk, a shadow fell on him.  A hefty cross spider <i>(Araneus diadematus)</i> , shaggy, with a white cross on its abdomen, appeared from nowhere and now looms right above it.  Instead of escaping, Petr Viktorovich tried to cross himself, losing the initiative and quenching the oscillatory impulse.  Bloody prejudices, he thought.  The paws of the spider lay on his shoulders, the world began to spin rapidly, and, before losing consciousness, he had time to notice his colleagues running away in panic and terror. <br><br>  Marina Ivanovna securely fastened the thread with a sea knot and stroked her belly with weary hairy legs.  The web should have been enough for another 3-4 radial passes through the site.  There were no riders nearby, and this was reassuring.  It seems that it will be possible to fulfill the standard and complete the shift without too much running around, after which you can refresh yourself in one of the dangling cocoons nearby.  Today she had to quit her job three times and hide in hiding places.  The peepholes darted suddenly, but were too slow to get close to Marina Ivanovna before she, leaving everything and rushing headlong under the protection of the net, hid in the shelter.  The constant tension caused by mortal danger exhausted much more than the work itself.  Spider eyesight is not very good.  In order to notice the appearance of riders in time, one had to look with all my eyes.  The correct strategy was considered to run under any sudden blackout and only then to understand what caused it there.  The victims were evenly pulling the web, impersonating themselves, but peacock eyes could easily turn it into a victim without touching the trapping net.  Their long ovipositor entered the tender belly of a spider easily and quickly. <br><br>  Dried ovipositions of peacock eyes were regularly demonstrated to spiders in civil security lessons.  What happened next was not kept secret either.  The spider, in which the rider laid his eggs, became an incubator for peacock-eyed larvae and after a while died, carrying the enemy inside the shelter.  The population has declined sharply, and the spiders were already on the verge of complete extinction, when the Wise Mentors found a salutary solution.  First, it was decided to build shelters instead of ordinary trapping networks, which were a chain of more or less spherical nests.  About a meter in diameter, they were surrounded by a multi-layer network along the outer perimeter.  And although such a form of the web was not particularly effective as a web of prey, it perfectly corresponded to the doctrine of defense and security.  The riders could not get inside the shelter, so the spiders could easily grow and multiply.  Despite this, the possibility of getting inside the larvae of riders, no less dangerous than the butterflies themselves, remained, which put the shelter in danger of being completely destroyed from the inside.  Therefore, the second fateful decision was the internal protection, carried out by the Wise Mentors, who could identify the infected spider and, if necessary, relatively easily cope with it alone.  The most powerful and large individuals became the teachers, who, as a reward, ate the infected brother, thereby saving the nest from a terrible fate.  Thus, the populations managed to survive, although the spiders now held mostly on the edges of the forest, where it was easy to find a frame for a suitable nest.  It is finally glorious days. <br><br>  Having finished the work and after having had a nice dinner, Marina Ivanovna headed towards the nearest entrance to the shelter.  Once inside, she, strictly observing the ritual, went on a physical examination to the Wise.  Approaching at the distance of an extended paw, she crossed herself and greeted the Wise One: <br><br>  - Peace to you, sister! <br><br>  The wisest nodded favorably and allowed her to approach for inspection.  Marina Ivanovna habitually began to turn around her axis, thus giving the Wisest the opportunity to inspect and sniff herself from all sides.  Performing all the gestures, she was calm and even pacified, so she did not immediately understand what happened when the Wise One bit her.  But why?  She is clean before the nest.  The day ended well!  ‚ÄúThis is a mistake,‚Äù thought Marina Ivanovna, after which the poison began to act, and her consciousness faded. <br><br>  Fedor Evgenievich threw back the mosquito net and went into the tent. <br><br>  - Horseradish with two!  - with feeling, he told Semen Viktorovich sitting at the table from the threshold.  Semyon Viktorovich, who was staring intently at a laptop coming in from behind the screen, hemmed, shifted his glasses to his forehead and began to rub his tired eyes.  There was no one else in the tent.  Fyodor Evgenievich pulled up a free chair to the table, hoisted his rather voluminous ass onto it and waited for what else Semen Viktorovich would say.  He, having finished rubbing his eyes and returning his glasses to his place, folded his arms over his chest and, leaning back in his chair, continued: <br>  - There is no court and no.  And there is no article in Nature either.  So it did not work out, it happens.  Tomorrow we collect equipment and shoot.  And so inhaled here.  Moreover, the pass to the zone of alienation ends.  Here not only the birds do not linger, even the higher mammals are almost extinct.  So we go.  Do you want some tea? <br>  Fedor E. negatively shook his head. <br>  - Drink, drink, - said Semyon Viktorovich as if conciliatory.  - Anyway, there is still thirty liters of water left, you have to pour out. <br><br>  And, without waiting for an answer, he rose from his chair, heading for the kettle. <br>  - But how so?  - With bitterness in his voice asked Fedor Evgenievich.  - Two years have ditched on this hypothesis!  Maybe they did not guess with some parameter?  Maybe they just need some additional conditions?  We are clearly missing something important. <br>  - You, as usual, two sugars?  - Asked Simon Viktorovich and threw tea bags with cups. <br>  - Yes, please ... After all, it all fits.  Field butterflies select a part of individuals, deprive them of wings and fatten them for riders who mimic the peacock eye.  And those, in exchange, protect the territory from the only natural enemy - the spider-krestovik.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The behavior of the crosses, their spherical nests, control at the entrance to the nest ‚Äî everything clearly indicates that we have an example of a very complex symbiotic group! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">‚ÄúWell, first of all, not everything,‚Äù said Simon Viktorovich, putting the cups on the table and sitting down. - We have already discussed more than once that giving a part of individuals for infection to riders butterflies can only in the most difficult times in order to support their population. And we are seeing a constant "feeding" of the entire population. And secondly, you just said yourself that the tests for infection of spiders with horsemen are negative. Moreover, one and all. How many trials have we done in all this time? 200-220?</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- 285, - Fedor Yevgenyevich answered sadly. - But we have not tried all the options and conditions. You can even work it out. And then, the conditions for feeding butterflies by riders could have arisen during the Great Emission, when conditions in the zone were much worse and, most likely, the population was on the verge of extinction. What is happening now - work on the old pattern. Although the conditions here, I agree with you, have already changed.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">- What else have we tried? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Humidity, light, acidic environment, alkaline environment, stages of development - under any conditions, the result is negative. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Will they be irradiated with ultraviolet light? </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In all such circumstances, riders easily infect a butterfly, they have whole incubators there, as you have seen. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But no spiders! </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I summarize. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Immediately upon return, we transfer material to biochemists, let them break their heads now. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And we did our job. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps we are missing something. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">I do not exclude this, but we did everything that was required of us. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The field part of the work is finished, being here not only does not make sense, but also very harmful. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This damn combine that just did not produce before the explosion. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's time to go back, Fedor. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">And let's finally have some tea.</font></font></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/395881/">https://habr.com/ru/post/395881/</a></p>
