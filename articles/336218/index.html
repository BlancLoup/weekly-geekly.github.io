One of the obvious options is to find courses for yourself and start actively studying the theory and solving practical problems.  However, this will have to allocate a significant portion of personal time.  There is another way - to turn to the ‚Äúpassive‚Äù source of knowledge: choose literature for yourself and immerse yourself in the subject, devoting it only half an hour per hour. <br><br>  Therefore, wanting to make life easier for ourselves and our readers, we made a short selection of books, articles and texts in the direction of neural networks and in-depth training recommended for residents to read GitHub, Quora, Reddit and other platforms.  It includes materials both for those who are just starting to get acquainted with neurotechnologies, and for colleagues who want to expand their knowledge in this area or just pick up ‚Äúeasy reading‚Äù for the evening. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/neurodatalab/blog/336218/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/96a/bd4/b83/96abd4b83965408b9994c0239ee450fd.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>  <i>/ Flickr / <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/giuseppemilo/12570992595/">Giuseppe Milo</a> / <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/">CC</a></i>
