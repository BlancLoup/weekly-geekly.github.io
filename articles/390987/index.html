I wrote after reading an article <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/264652/">Sony pursues of the author, whose video she used in her video</a> : Alexey has the same story. <br><br>  First, someone bought the <a href="http://videohive.net/item/real-love-story/12112764">Real Love Story</a> video, then used it as the basis for singer Pedro Lima's video (the video is already closed), and immediately after this, Sony Music Entertainment registered the video in ContentID on YouTube and blocked the original. <br><br>  Alexei‚Äôs appeal was rejected by the ‚Äúcopyright holder,‚Äù which is actually the artist himself.

      Under the cut - a chronology of events: the story of how YouTube in controversial situations stands on the side of a large company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/14a/5e0/21b/14a5e021b9359bed40fa30fe5171d737.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  YouTube sometimes blocks videos in a very strange way.  For example, in 2012, a video about the landing of the rover Curiousity was <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/149411/">blocked by a</a> private news agency, and the recordings of Martin Luther King‚Äôs speeches could not be found because of EMI‚Äôs lawyers. <br><br>  In October 2015, I <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/264652/">wrote about the video artist Mitch Martinez</a> , who issued Sony Music Entertainment a license to use his work, and the music company issued this work for his own and blocked the monetization of the original video on YouTube.  <a href="https://youtu.be/ZesruemlCc0">The original video</a> Martinez was published in 2013, and the Transviolet video for the composition Bloodstream appeared only in August 2015. <br><br>  In July 2015, Alexey made a video for the next project.  This is a sand animation in which anyone who buys it can insert their text and get the finished romantic video.  He then published it for sale in his profile on the <a href="http://videohive.net/item/real-love-story/12112764">highway</a> and on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D_yU4elC4iPM">Youtube</a> channel as an advertisement.  Alexey Shamraev sells licenses for his works while remaining the copyright holder.  Someone at Sony decided that it didn't matter, and after using the video for the music video, Pedro Lima demanded YouTube to block the recurring clips - including the original. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_yU4elC4iPM%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiVvzHhE6HGQTi3dkOvdoiBJhaSsw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The first complaint on YouTube received the answer "The right holder reviewed your claim and confirmed your complaint about your video." <br><blockquote>  The only thought was - What kind of nonsense is this happening ?!  I once again wrote this singer on Facebook and said that I would send DMCA complaints wherever they posted this video - YouTube, Apple Store, Google Play, etc. </blockquote><br>  The author turned directly to the musician on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pedrolimaofficial">Facebook</a> , the representative of the singer spoke with Alexey.  She said that their designer bought this video on videohive, and that she could send a copy of the purchase license.  Alexey replied that they could broadcast this video, but they could not act as the copyright owner and block similar videos.  And he pointed out to her the 19th point of the videohive license, which states that <a href="http://videohive.net/licenses/terms/regular">the author of the project retains the copyright, and you are granted a license to use</a> .  The representative of the singer apologized and said that she would soon inform VEVO about this misunderstanding and tell about the results. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/998/9d8/904/9989d8904e5df1639ec369d408d8c5b1.jpg" width="600" alt="image"><br>  <i>Screenshot of video recorded in ContentID</i> <br><br>  There was no response in the next ten days. <br><br>  Alexey wrote to YouTube with a request to remove the video from ContentID due to copyright infringement and the rights of other buyers of the work.  At the same time, the author did not demand to remove the musician‚Äôs video clip.  He attached the documents and one of the original versions of the video to the letter. <br><br>  What are the answers to YouTube? <br><blockquote>  Hello, <br><br>  Thank you for your message.  We received this content under license from Vevo. <br><br>  For this reason, we will not be able to comply with your removal request.  If you wish, you can follow the issue directly with Vevo. <br><br>  Regards, <br>  The YouTube Legal Support Team </blockquote><br>  After that, Aleksey decided to write VEVO directly <a href="http://comingsoon.vevo.com/">on the site</a> - but the page in Russia does not work. <br><br>  On January 18, 2016, videos based on Real Love Story were blocked on another YouTube channel.  On February 13, the video on the PedroLimaVEVO channel was removed from open access, but returned three days later.  There was no response from VEVO at that time. <br><br>  On February 18, the video was hidden again, and on February 24, 2016, a response from YouTube finally arrived: <br><blockquote>  Hi Alexey Shamraev, <br>  Good news!  Your dispute <br>  copyrighted within 30 days <br>  has now been released. <br>  Video title: "Real Love <br>  Story <br>  - The YouTube Team </blockquote><br>  Justice has not yet triumphed, since the video is blocked to this day.  The original video was unlocked automatically after the appeal was not considered for 30 days.  Alexey did not receive any answers, and the video was not removed from ContentID. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/390987/">https://habr.com/ru/post/390987/</a></p>
