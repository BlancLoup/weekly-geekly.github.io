  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Post of Russia and China Post will reduce the delivery time from Chinese online stores to 7 days</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://www.russianpost.ru/">Russian Post</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Post">China Post have</a> concluded a cooperation agreement.  This happened on September 3, when Vladimir Putin visited Beijing on an official visit.  At the same time, the heads of the postal companies of Russia (Dmitry Strashnov) and China (Li Guohua) signed an agreement on the launch of two joint projects. <br><br>  Pochta Rossii and China Post have agreed to launch delivery of postal items by rail as part of freight and passenger trains. <a name="habracut"></a>  ‚ÄúThis decision will contribute to the further growth of commodity turnover between the countries and the development of the transit potential of Russia,‚Äù the official report of Pochta said.  Earlier, international mail from China was delivered to Russia only by air or car.  A trial launch of the new delivery method took place on January 15, 2015, when the first container of correspondence arrived in Moscow from Harbin (China). <br><br>  The partners are planning to finalize the second joint project with the saying name ‚Äú7-day package‚Äù until November 1 of this year.  Such parameters as coverage, marking method and other technical details need to be agreed upon.  "Products from major Chinese online stores will be consolidated at the logistics hubs in China, undergoing priority processing and delivered to post offices in major Russian cities," the company said.

      In total, in the first half of 2015, ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù processed 49 million parcels (import, export and transit).  ‚ÄúFor the first half of 2015, the volume of mail sent increased by 1.5 times compared with last year,‚Äù said Dmitry Strashnov.  Including 39.2 million parcels (this is about 80% of all shipments) arrived in Russia from China.  Figures show that here China is in the majority. <br><br>  China Post is featured in another Russian-Chinese project.  In July 2015, Russian Post became the first authorized postal operator of the largest Chinese online store <a href="http://en.jd.com/ru">JD.com</a> .  Retailer came to Russia in mid-June.  According to JD.com, its products should be shipped from Chinese warehouses to the Post of Russia offices using the China Post. <br><br>  JD.com promises to deliver packages to Central Russia within 7-10 days and within 15-20 days to the regions.  Previously, such speeds were simply unthinkable.  So, in 2012, delivery was delayed for 1.5-2 months.  The new logistics solution of the Post of Russia and the Post of China will set a deadline for delivery of international mail from the time it was received by Post of China to delivery to the addressee of Post of Russia, representatives of the company noted. <br><br>  Despite the fact that courier companies in cooperation with online stores can be more flexible, none of the logistics companies have such coverage as Post of Russia, <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/03/09/2015/55e85d359a79478e6b0b8649">told</a> RBC the head of the National Association of Distance Trading Alexander Ivanov.  In contrast to the Russian Internet sites, the Chinese want to work with the ‚ÄúMail of Russia‚Äù, so now mainly goods from <a href="http://ru.aliexpress.com/ru_home.htm">AliExpress</a> or from catalogs are delivered to the Russian regions, he noted.  Because of this, Russian online stores are losing profits, says Ivanov. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294214/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294214/</a></p>
