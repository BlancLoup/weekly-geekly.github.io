And only then, based on the answers to these two key questions, to think about how to present your product to it. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We have two major areas: <i>b2b (business ‚Äì to-business)</i> and b2c (business-to-customer).  <i>If you come across these definitions for the first time, in other words, who are your customers (legal entity (b2b) or individual (b2c))?</i>  The direction of lead generation also depends on the direction.

      <br>
      Further we answer where we will look for our client?  Where does he live?  When is the best time to contact him?  The Internet space is huge and getting lost there is very simple. <br>  Let's look at an example. <br><br>  <b>Example:</b> You offer foreign language lessons for individuals. <br>  The service is quite popular and you face the question of how to find customers?  What to do, where to start? <br>  And something has become lazy for you to think about how and where to attract them, and then you decide to go to a special agency so that they can do everything for you.  This may be an advertising, marketing, lead generation agency.  If the agency is professional, they will immediately start asking you many questions: what is the portrait of your client, what is your competitive advantage, what territory do you work in, etc.  and as a result, if the agency is good, their services will cost you a pretty penny.  So you can do a little time and effort to do everything yourself, or if you want everything to be done well - contact the <a href="http://speedlead.ru/">agency</a> . <br><br>  So, for example, if you offer English language courses and are in the South of Moscow, the client should have a very strong incentive to come to you from the North, he will most likely find courses closer to him if you don‚Äôt have anything for traveling through all of Moscow . <br>  So do you need Lida for your courses?  Goods running and there is a demand for it.  Where to begin?  (We are now only considering online methods) <br><br>  <b>First:</b> do you have a website where customers will come from, where will they find out about your services? <br>  If not, then you need to order.  The site should be good and most importantly - selling!  (Order yourself a quality Lending Page) prices vary, if we are talking about a quality and more or less unique product, the price for it will be at least 20,000 rubles.  And so boldly cook 30.000-50.000.  A good site is worth it. <br>  If you have a website - great?  Then does he sell?  If not, order a Landing Page! <br><br>  <b>Second:</b> Directly turn to lead generation.  Think <b>where it is more profitable for you to drive the leads?</b>  If you do not want to think - contact the lead generation agency.  But I recommend thinking - it is more useful and cheaper. <br><br>  There are many options.  The simplest is contextual advertising.  This is the first place to start, contextual advertising you should have.  The exception is the sale of any ... nonsense type: the means to increase you know what or the next dietary supplements and means for losing weight.  In 95% of cases, context is what you should start.  At least a minimum!  <i>If from it goes too little traffic?</i> <br><br>  <b>Connect the next channel.</b>  In the case of courses on languages, good traffic comes from social networks.  There are two ways: <b>Targeted advertising and the placement of paid posts in groups</b> .  This is if we are talking about quick ways, in a good way, then you need to create your own group and promote it.  But only then customers will not go soon, from experience it is at least six months, and even more. <br>  Again, prices vary due to a variety of factors, but in order to start properly, prepare at least 20-30 at most. <br><br>  <b>Alternative ways or "free channels"</b> .  I am writing in quotes, as they are conditionally free, but you can do it for free, but in order to make it qualitatively you have to either pay or spend a lot of time. <br><br>  Here I will simply list that we need two things - high-quality content and a platform for its placement, and this can already be anything: Youtube, a blog, a forum, a bulletin board, thematic sites, and so on, which is enough for imagination.  The bigger and better, the better.  Now in detail we do not stop at this, I will write in a separate article. <br><br>  To begin with, this should be enough for you to start - later, as we grow, we also include other sources: SEO, SMM, telemarketing, Viral advertising, Email marketing and so on and so forth.  The benefit of a lot of options. <br><br>  But it is important to remember: ‚Äú <b>Not all channels are equally good and effective specifically in your case!</b>  ‚ÄúSome will be better, some worse, some will not work at all.  For example, it is foolish to launch the sale of refrigerators through Vkontakte! <br><br>  Write questions in the comments.  I will be glad to answer. <br>  Next time I will tell you more about contextual advertising, and then I think about CPA networks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286888/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286888/</a></p>
