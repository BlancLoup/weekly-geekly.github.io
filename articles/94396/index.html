In total, the topic scored about 70 votes, the votes were divided almost equally (but there were 10 more people willing).  What did the author get for this topic?  The author received a letter with the following content: <br><blockquote>  Come, ISVir! <br><br>  Unfortunately, I have to separate you from Habr for 1000 days, blocking your account.  However, on February 13, 2013 your account will be unlocked and you will be able to use it as before.

      Best regards, GUARD. <br></blockquote><br>  To which the author responded and started an entire correspondence, which will be submitted to your court.  The purpose of the publication of this correspondence is to prove the administration‚Äôs devil-may-care attitude to the resource as to thematic and professional, and attention is paid to it, only as a babbler, that the author and I consider unacceptable and not honest with respect to the local users. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Actually the correspondence itself (blue - the administration of Habr, black - the author of that topic): <br><blockquote>  <font color="#000099">Come, ISVir!</font> <font color="#000099"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000099">Unfortunately, I have to separate you from Habr for 1000 days, blocking your account.</font>  <font color="#000099">However, on February 13, 2013 your account will be unlocked and you will be able to use it as before.</font> <font color="#000099"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000099">Best regards, GUARD.</font> <font color="#000099"><br></font> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  What are you guys excommunicating me for no reason?  Mata was not, the people put pluses for both the topic and karma.  You are deleting ... what then is WEB2.0?  Or you take the example of the Russian government - ‚ÄúWe have a democracy, but we do not allow it to be used.‚Äù  The community regulates itself, and there is nothing to intervene, this is not an emergency situation, not a hacking, this is quite a standard topic, which, as I said, people like it, agree with it.  Not good.  Respect with an answer, be so indulgent. <br></blockquote><br><blockquote>  <font color="#000099">The topics on Habr devoted to the discussion of Habr were never supported by us, all the more like yours: ‚ÄúHabr dies, Habr is not the one, Habr will soon be ... end‚Äù well, leave the ranks of the participants, stand aside and see what all these praises are for the project?</font>  <font color="#000099">Write a useful article, show an example to others, this is what Web2.0 is.</font> <font color="#000099"><br></font>  <font color="#000099">Adding a topic is not an argument of its usefulness, especially when the ratio is + 25 / -21 = +4</font> <font color="#000099"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000099">Summary: We see no point in publishing materials like yours on our project, since they do not carry anything useful for the community.</font> <font color="#000099"><br></font> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  Not supported by you?  And what difference are they supported by you?  Habr does not belong to you, so to speak ... you are just servants of the people.  I didn‚Äôt intend to leave the ranks of the participants either, I just urged the community to look at the problem, look directly and try (not to one, but all together) to correct the situation.  I wrote useful articles, very useful, I would even say exclusive material, since  Some of the problems that I described here were not covered on the Internet at all. <br><br>  As for the padding of the topic, what then is the general argument?  Those.  Does the main shit climb, which nobody really likes?  You are carrying nonsense, I probably know your self-regulation system better than yours.  The main thing is how your visitors think, not how you think.  You confused the attitude too, at the time of deletion there were about 70 votes for the topic, and the estimate was +10, which means that I touched the people for living, that was my goal. <br><br>  Thus, it seems to me, I refute your resume and urge to unblock your account with the restoration of the topic. <br><br>  And yet, this topic does not deserve the author's excommunication for 1000 days. <br></blockquote><br><blockquote>  <font color="#000099">Our principles are unshakable since the foundation of the resource and its transformation into one of the strongest communities of Runet.</font>  <font color="#000099">Judging by your response letter, you are not planning to abide by and adhere to our rules and principles, considering us to be service personnel.</font> <font color="#000099"><br></font> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  For starters, you could describe your principles to talk about their steadfastness, because  Only such remarks as ‚Äúnot supported‚Äù, ‚Äúwe do not see the point‚Äù were noticed in the text.  What principles are we talking about? <br><br>  Then it is worth noting that there was no direct violation of the rules, because the absence was not even argued. <br><br>  Yes, I consider you to be service personnel, which does not interfere in the same way to regard you as an administration, creators, and to thank you for it.  However, again, this does not prevent me from believing that the administration, creators, including service personnel may be wrong, I urged you to rethink your attitude to this topic. <br><br>  Unfortunately, you did everything not convincingly, and only in favor of yourself, what moves you?  Most likely fear, fear of rebellion, revolution, but about any principles of speech can not go. <br><br>  What do you think about what I said? <br></blockquote><br><blockquote>  <font color="#000099">I repeat once again:</font> <font color="#000099"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000099">- Topics about Habr√© on Habr√© are never supported by the administration;</font> <font color="#000099"><br></font>  <font color="#000099">- Topics discussing the actions of the Administration;</font> <font color="#000099"><br></font>  <font color="#000099">There are a dozen more items, partly indicated directly in the rules of the site.</font>  <font color="#000099">You were sanctioned on the first point.</font> <font color="#000099"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000099">&gt;&gt;&gt; "Most likely fear, fear of rebellion, revolution, but about any principles of speech can not go."</font> <font color="#000099"><br><br></font>  <font color="#000099">And what kind of revolution and rebellion are we talking about?</font>  <font color="#000099">The most interesting thing against whom is it against the administration or between new and old users?</font> <font color="#000099"><br></font> </blockquote><br><blockquote>  I would like to clarify that ‚Äúnot supported‚Äù and ‚Äúprohibited‚Äù are two different things though.  I did not expect any support from you, just as I did not expect excommunication for this topic. <br><br>  Of course, about the rebellion, too much was said, but it is also impossible to deny some kind of "condemnation" of the administration lately.  I do not divide the user into ‚Äúnew‚Äù and ‚Äúold‚Äù, I divide the habr into ‚Äúold‚Äù and ‚Äúnew‚Äù.  What is going on now?  The main thing is filled with useless articles about workplaces, about how to sleep, work, eat, how to write ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù in PHP, a lot of save-pastes, there is practically no original content!  But not everything is so bad, there are still topics in the "new", but they are not displayed on Habr, because they are interesting units.  Popularization Habra led to a decrease in the quality of content, and I called on people to think about it. <br><br>  And in that I was excommunicated, I see no loss on my part, but I only see that you lost an author who actually wrote technical topics, and not about how to write Hello World, but more profound and professional ones.  In any case, at the moment, responding to your letter, I am driven only by the desire to understand - ‚Äúfor what‚Äù and a little offensively. <br></blockquote><br><br>  As can be seen from this correspondence, the administration completely refuses to listen to the author of the topic.  And excuses some kind of "rotten" phrases. <br><br>  But the problem that the author touched on existed and continues to exist, look at the main one right now, what will you see there?  You will see topics indirectly related to IT, almost ZERO useful information, and every day the situation is worse. <br><br>  <b>I propose to support the author of that topic!</b>  <b>Those who agree with him, plus the topic!</b> <br><br>  And a huge request, if I‚Äôm banned - save this text and publish it again!  We are a community ourselves, we do not need a guide that leads us to the cliff. <br><br>  PS In each letter from the administration there was a signature: <br><br><blockquote>  <font color="#000099">The information in this email and any application is confidential and is intended only for the recipient.</font>  <font color="#000099">This letter may not be publicly distributed or used by anyone other than the addressee.</font>  <font color="#000099">If you are not a recipient, please inform us and delete all copies of the letter.</font>  <font color="#000099">Any copying, public posting or distribution is strictly prohibited.</font> <font color="#000099"><br></font> </blockquote><br><br>  But this is nonsense, the author has the right to publish what he wants and where he wants the information that came to him in the mail. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/94396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/94396/</a></p>
