      A bit of history: the Shopozz.com mail forwarding service originated on the basis of Shopozz.com, a parent company that since 2005 has been helping customers make purchases in stores in the USA, the UK, China, Germany and Europe.  As a result of many years of work, it is understood that we need a separate website designed for independent customers who need fast and reliable shipment of goods from a virtual US address.  Actually, in July, he appeared and immediately earned in full force. <br><br>  But back to the statistics.  The first is the <b>number of shipments</b> .  For clarity, the graph is combined with the dollar rate, which is marked with a red line.  For obvious reasons, we cannot indicate a specific number of shipments - this would be too luxurious a gift to competitors.  But do not be in a hurry to be disappointed, firstly, 250,000 registered users allow us to judge the scale of the transfer (here and further statistics display joint statistics of COM and RU services), secondly, we can judge the dynamics even without specific numbers - and this is the most interesting .  And thirdly, these are the only numbers that we have classified. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0d1/d39/5c9/0d1d395c9d324d3780c35c707bd33727.png"><br><br>  Since July, the number of shipments is kept at a more or less stable level.  There was an expected surge in September, when everyone returned from holidays.  Then, simultaneously with the growth of the dollar, the number of packages began to fall.  It would seem - the fall is not the most disastrous.  However, the experience of previous years suggests that in the period from September to December, the number of shipments should have increased significantly.  We see a clear decline, which allows us to talk about an approximately 40-50% decrease compared to the same period of the last years. <br><br>  It should be noted that a similar situation is observed in other services for sending.  So Shipito, <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/20/01/2015/54be6b2c9a794733d6da46f5">in an interview</a> with RBC, announced a 55% reduction in shipments compared to December 2013, and Dostami.ru stopped delivering cargo to Russia in general.  However, Shopozz has some reason for optimism.  Firstly, the number of items sent through Shopozz.com is gradually increasing - users are becoming more and more active in independent purchases.  Secondly, we see a very active ‚Äúgrowth point‚Äù in the form of shipments from China.  Especially because Shopozz has its own warehouse there. <br><br>  We continue the statistics: the <b>average cost of the shipment</b> - with the exception of October, the average cost of investment is about $ 250 (the October anomaly can be explained by the start of sales of the iPhone 6 and bulk shipments of phones to itself). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0cb/9b6/87e/0cb9b687e6614733b4a31f56161e8586.png"><br><br>  Interestingly, the growth of the dollar did not affect this figure at all.  People both bought the same things for themselves and continue.  In addition, the number of items in the packages has not changed at all - on average, each customer of the service puts three items in one package.  Preliminary data of January is also somewhere within these limits. <br><br>  <b>Shipping Costs</b> : As a rule, most customers chose the fastest shipment via EMS.  This suggests that customers valued speed and convenience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d4d/65c/d13/d4d65cd13eb24aa1b88f8a6ab2351e3a.png"><br><br>  But since November, exactly with the growth rate, users began to significantly save on delivery, choosing cheaper ways. <br><br>  Just a couple of words about the delivery.  The leading cities where packages arrive are, of course, Moscow and St. Petersburg.  Against the background of these two capitals, the rest of the cities noticeably lag behind.  However, in numerical terms, it cannot be said that other major cities receive few parcels.  Quite a lot, but even close is not as much as Moscow and Peter. <br><br>  Now, as for the timing.  As already mentioned, many have ordered delivery via EMS.  The average time is 8 days (guaranteed time is 2 weeks).  Priority Mail - an average of 16 days (guaranteed time - 4 weeks), Shopozz By Sea - 32 days (guaranteed - 9 weeks), Shopozz Avia - 18 days (guaranteed - 4 weeks). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff1/bc7/476/ff1bc74764de4840bc23ea04148483a0.png"><br><br>  I must say that in Shopozz very responsive to the timing.  Therefore, the service has a guarantee - if the parcel arrived later than the agreed date, the user receives compensation in the form of a free shipment of the next shipment.  For the entire 2014, there is only one (I repeat, one) official contacting the support service for non-compliance with the deadlines.  Naturally, the client received the promised discount. <br><br>  As mentioned in previous posts, Shopozz.com calls itself a free mail forwarding service from abroad.  Free of charge is achieved due to the fact that the user pays for sending at the rate of the postal service.  As if he personally came to the post office abroad and sent himself a parcel.  Shopozz itself makes a profit at the expense of volume discounts - with a large number of items, the postal operator makes a discount allowing the service to live and develop.  The second item of income is the provision of additional services for checking goods and photographing them.  Agree, it would be a shame to buy a product (especially if it concerns something used, bought on Ebay), pay a lot of money, wait two or three weeks and get something that was not ordered. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f95/440/2fa/f954402fa7e04745b3e818cc1ff08b1f.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Sample test photo from <a href="http://geektimes.ru/company/shopozzcom/blog/240780/">this</a> post</i> <br><br>  As the statistics show, on average owners of 16% of the packages order the product check service and 14% ask to take a picture of the thing.  Interestingly, with the growth of the dollar, the number of checks fell.  In January, we record somewhere a two-fold drop in these indicators - with the current dollar level, people are trying to save on any additional service. <br><br>  As a conclusion, I would like to make a small forecast for the first quarter of 2015.  By the cost of shipments, it is clear that people are not going to refuse to buy the usual things - if you are used to buying jeans from one firm, you are unlikely to switch to Turkish jeans.  Well, after the December jump in prices, it often turns out again that ordering is cheaper than buying on the spot.  So the ‚Äúaverage check‚Äù of one parcel remained unchanged.  And, apparently, if it decreases in the near future, it is insignificant. <br><br>  But what people really began to save on was the cost of shipping, delivery time (a week or three) and various additional services such as insurance.  Moreover, by the time of shopping it is clear that people have become much more active in purchasing on sales.  The 50% discount, which was quite realistic to catch on ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù, perfectly compensated for the growth of the dollar exchange rate twice.  Those.  the price of goods in rubles has not changed, but the goods at least remained in the same category of availability as they were before sales. <br><br>  In turn, the company Shopozz promises to do everything possible to reduce the cost of shipping goods through the introduction of cheaper tariffs.  Without compromising quality, of course.  After all, Shopozz guarantees its delivery time. <br><br> <a href="http://shopozz.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a5/b7d/d1f/2a5b7dd1f48e41b5b2bb9f52f50d8c28.png"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/365055/">https://habr.com/ru/post/365055/</a></p>
