  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of KPI automation software</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  More than half of top managers and business owners are currently dissatisfied with the current situation in the company for managing employees, constant turnover, dissatisfaction and carelessness of staff.  The heads of departments either silence the problems within the team entrusted to them, or do nothing to solve them, receiving a salary and making a discount on the ‚Äúpermanent crisis in the economy.‚Äù <br><br>  Therefore, the correct setting of business goals, payment by result, the introduction of kpi-performance indicators for evaluating activities for each employee of the company, whether line personnel or tops, becomes a problem and a headache number 1, especially since the business owner most often finds out about the problems in the team almost the last, and he is often very busy to correct the situation quickly and with little blood in a short time.  As a result, the business loses efficiency by 15-20% and sags in time for a couple of months almost always. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  However, not everything is so simple, many companies have already learned how to set annual goals, but this is not enough.  The economic crisis is, by and large, in the head, but in a year a lot can change from the introduction of the new Federal Law to the departure of the key employee responsible for managing projects on decree.  Therefore, the Performance Management methodology is primarily a regular assessment of personnel (there are many methods: assessment centers, assessment 360, etc.), increasing the motivation and involvement of personnel, as well as talent management and personnel reserve of the organization. <br><br>  The second difficulty is to automate the process of collecting, structuring and evaluating information on indicators.  For many large Russian companies, it is still considered normal to ‚Äútake out‚Äù all this huge layer of work on the chief accountant in Excel for 1500-2000 people (a monument to such an employee is the author's opinion).

      Below is a comparative description of software solutions for automating KPI management, not just for calculating monthly bonuses and bonuses, but for transparent and effective control of the activities of all employees of the organization, including management.  These are programs that I know, I once saw a similar review on the site, but unfortunately a long time ago, and the topic became relevant with the arrival of a new manager in the company. <br><br>  There are many software solutions on the Russian market for evaluating KPI personnel, differing among themselves in terms of functionality, methodological depth, and user-friendly interface.  However, it is advisable to consider the most popular solutions.  In the review we will consider such software products as ‚ÄúKPI-Drive‚Äù, ‚Äú1C: Management by Objectives and KPI‚Äù, ‚ÄúHighPer‚Äù, ‚ÄúKPI Monitor‚Äù, ‚ÄúElma KPI‚Äù, ‚ÄúKPI Suite‚Äù, ‚ÄúSucsess Factors‚Äù.  Data for the review were taken from open sources, in particular, from the official sites of developers.  It should be noted that some information in the review may be missing, due to the fact that the developer has not posted it on his website, and getting the demo version is not always possible. <br><br>  From my own experience, I can say that there is a lot of information in the network, but it is fragmented and needs to be structured before it says something to its director.  I will not promote anyone, I won‚Äôt even tell who we chose in the end, just present to you the comparative analysis I created. <br><br>  I will listen with interest to the opinions of experts, experts and those who are not indifferent about performance management trends. <br><br><h3>  KPI-Drive </h3><br>  The <a href="https://kpi-drive.ru/">KPI-Drive</a> solution was developed by one of the first in the Russian market.  Initially developed on a cloud platform and works through a web browser.  At the same time, the external interface of the software product looks somewhat outdated.  The author of the product has developed its own methodology for implementing the personnel assessment system and, as a result, the product's functionality has evolved in accordance with the author's methodology.  Most of the users of the solution are those employees who completed the courses and developed an assessment system using the proposed methodology.  Since the product is built entirely on the author's approach, this is its weak point from the point of view of universality (the use of personnel assessment methods, which are widely used in Russian enterprises), and adaptability.  In addition to the functionality of accounting performance of quantitative and qualitative indicators, well developed functionality for managing employee benefits: payroll, taxes, etc. The solution involves the collective work of employees with the system to coordinate goals and summarize the results.  There is no mobile version of the solution.  There are no visualization tools, no open information about the availability of automated data loading tools.  There is a kind of report designer.  The site provides reviews and feedback on the implemented solutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/th/ug/4k/thug4kqr6iaazezwh5b48iurbmq.png"><br><br><h3>  1C: Goal and KPI Management </h3><br>  Software <a href="http://topfactor.pro/product/management-by-objectives-and-kpi.php">1C: Management by Objectives and KPI is</a> written on the 1C: Enterprise 8.3 platform.  This is one of the competitive advantages of the solution, since the platform has found wide distribution in companies in the post-Soviet space.  The solution can be integrated with other accounting systems on the platform of the same name.  In the system, you can independently design various methods of personnel assessment (KPI, tasks, standards), automate regular assessment procedures (typical business process and setting alerts).  Interactivity is realized through the use of personal user accounts, which can be configured in accordance with roles and rights.  Personnel and service functionality includes: the calculation of premiums, the formation of ratings, dashboards and graphs by indicators, report designers for business analysis.  The interface is provided by the 1C: Enterprise platform and is familiar to most users working in the b2b sector.  It is possible to use the WEB-interface and work "in the cloud", the mobile version is missing.  There is a developed functionality for automatic data collection: data collection through a com connection, exchange of xml packages, connection of external data sources - seamless integration with most popular DBMS.  There is information on the implemented solutions among both medium-sized and large companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ey/ty/a5/eytya5loq_0pkq9bbyxiferdrfq.png"><br><br><h3>  KPI Monitor </h3><br>  The <a href="http://www.kpi-monitor.ru/about/overview">KPI Monitor</a> product is patented and entered into the register of Russian software (as well as 1C: Target Management and KPI), as part of the import substitution program.  The solution is more positioned as a business intelligent (BI) tool.  As a consequence, the solution architecture focuses on working with quantitative data (KPI), the functionality allows the use of multidimensional data analysis and interactive visualization.  The program has ample opportunities to consolidate quantitative indicators, convenient and friendly interface.  The development of the functional within the framework of the EPM concept allows the solution to top management and financial services for financial planning and forecasting.  For solving performance management tasks, it is possible to launch a ‚Äúreporting company‚Äù, collect assessments of competencies, but there is no possibility to agree on an action plan (tasks and projects).  Also to the advantages include a mobile application.  The list of buyers includes large companies, in particular, banks.  There are special conditions for the acquisition of educational institutions. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ki/z_/oz/kiz_oz2hoz-1keywvrn9fimjb6a.png"><br><br><h3>  Highper </h3><br>  The <a href="http://highper.ru/">Highper</a> solution has very limited functionality and a somewhat outdated design, despite the fact that it has appeared relatively recently on the market.  On the other hand, a simple KPI calculation tool may be needed by a small business, since it does not require significant initial setup costs.  The assessment model allows you to use both quantitative criteria, manage tasks, and apply evaluation sheets.  There are several pre-configured reports; graphical visualization tools are missing altogether.  There is a function of reminders: for the establishment of a fact to the system administrator or about the invincibility of filling in evaluation sheets.  There is the possibility of loading data from MS Excel, 1C (for sn), csv, xml. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/me/ss/xg/messxg6qbcuq_7cljjzeahwska0.png"><br><br><h3>  SAP SuccessFactors </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.successfactors.com/en_us.html">SAP SuccessFactors</a> - refers to a complex HRM-systems, so this review considers the module Performance &amp; Goals.  The solution is developed on a cloud platform and is a web portal for coordinating goals and organizing the process of evaluating employees in an organization.  It is possible to set goals, cascade them around the organization, track current performance statuses.  A high degree of interactivity due to the provision of interaction on one site, the use of a mobile application.  For the evaluation process, routing can be configured, integration with e-mail is implemented for sending reminders and timing messages.  The goal calibration process allows you to identify the best and worst employees in the company, ample opportunities to visualize the dynamics of the execution of goals and a large selection of personnel forms and reports.  It is possible to adjust the reward according to the size of the personal contribution to the success of the company.  Based on the available information on the developer‚Äôs website, it can be concluded that there are large-scale projects with big business (mostly not in Russia).  At the same time, investment in the implementation of the project with this product will be among the highest.  In addition, access to the solution may be limited on the territory of Russia, in connection with the requirements of the law to store personal data on servers hosted in the Russian Federation (now the data center is located abroad). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yy/v7/8n/yyv78numbksn-vlslzfmpcr1u8k.png"><br><br><h3>  Elma KPI </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.elma-bpm.ru/product/kpi/">Elma KPI</a> is an automated system that allows you to build a map of the company's strategic and operational goals, and then decompose them to individual employees.  To create matrices of effectiveness, both quantitative and qualitative indicators are used.  There is a designer for setting up business processes, but there are no templates for conducting evaluation sessions, while the internal communications function is well developed: you can leave comments, send messages.  There are no facilities for managing payroll, only one report on labor costs was found.  There is a constructor through which you can configure control panels, many filters and data sorting capabilities.  The program has an application in the App Store for iPAD.  The solution has a large variety of data collection mechanisms: measurement of embedded business processes, direct requests to databases, data collection from websites, data collection from email, integration with OLAP cubes, etc.  There are no published embedded solutions for this module of the system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sp/bo/ts/spbotsyrrhfzwnyeeek39tiuxge.png"><br><br><h3>  KPI Suite </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.kpisuite.com/">KPI Suite is</a> positioned as a software platform designed to organize employee collaboration.  The developer offers finished products (modules) developed on this platform, including for personnel evaluation.  The main focus of the decision is on the organization of interactive work of employees, data visualization using information panels.  There is a project management, risk management, strategic panel in the form of a classic BSC-card.  No information was found about the ability to generate reports.  Also, there are no tools to support typical performance management processes and alerts.  The supplier declares support for loading data from various DBMS using intermediate tables - windows.  Very modestly presented information on implemented projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ty/hc/kn/tyhcknvmiijqngnnwvenpyckshm.png"><br><br><h3>  findings </h3><br>  In order to present all the collected information, a comparative table was finally prepared with the evaluation of software products for each of the criteria using a five-point scale.  Such information will help save time and effort during the decision to choose a software product and launch an automation project.  However, you need to understand that the project implementation of performance management in small, medium and large businesses will have its own characteristics and priorities.  Industry specificity also imposes its own requirements and limitations.  For this reason, the final score for each decision is not shown in the table.  To make the right decision in each case, you need to understand which of the criteria must be taken into account and with what weight. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-e/x-/0y/-ex-0ygbthqbkoprdu4qindjdsc.png"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/352418/">https://habr.com/ru/post/352418/</a></p>
