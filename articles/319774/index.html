  <section class="page js-page"><h1>IDEA is time to dig in?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this article I want to raise the topic of aging companies and the eternal question: what should simple users do?  On the example of IDEA.  With graphs of degradation and decay. <br><br>  Those who are interested in theory, I advise you to read the recently published remarkable article " <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315924/">Biological background of the degradation of companies</a> ."  I want to discuss a very specific situation, as an example of when good things start to give an unpleasant smell. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This story began for me with the fact that a serious IDE appeared on the market for my beloved Python - this is PyCharm.  In JetBrains, apparently, they realized that they are good at doing IDE, and all IDEs are somewhat similar, and, in general, why not capture this interesting market a little more than completely.  Anyway, as a result, in addition to IntelliJ IDEA, many wonderful IDEs were born: PhpStorm, PyCharm, RubyMine, WebStorm, AppCode, CLion, DataGrip, Rider - this is a modest list from the official site, and, according to rumors, JetBrains does not plan stop. <br><br>  I want to note that I consider PyCharm not only the best, but also in principle the only sane IDE for Python to date.  And I think that I was very lucky that this product was born.  What a joy to forget about all the crutch IDE and short editors, and go to PyCharm!  When everything works out of the box, it gives a wonderful sense of concentration.  You bow over the code, like an old watchmaker, and with all the thoroughness and scrupulousness you immerse yourself in your task.  And nothing distracts.  And not too lazy to reach out for the right tool, when everything is at hand.

      While I was doing my own business, growing professionally, JetBrains was also growing, and very active.  And if the ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù of one person is a more or less well-adjusted and understandable process for everyone, then the growth of a company is a big challenge.  The transformation of a small cohesive team into an organization of hundreds of people is a very risky business.  And in the end, even if the growth is successful, as a rule, nothing remains of that small team.  The company loses its soul.  Old ideological employees are tired of the same type of tasks and even partially run up.  New come for a high-paying place in a stable and successful company, and on their background, ideas are becoming less and less.  It becomes difficult to manage a company, bureaucratization begins, standardization of processes, and so on.  New goals and strap requires attracting (or growing) marketers.  The bosses are less involved in development and more and more in management.  New, ambitious ideas and projects emerge, on which the lion‚Äôs share of the most valuable resources is being spent, and old projects turn into silent sad horses pulling the whole company. <br><br>  One of the bad signs for me was the change of icons.  I loved the old icons, they were very detailed and therefore visually well distinguished.  But someone decided that flat minimalistic icons are now in fashion.  Then the IDE icon itself changed, and it became difficult for me to distinguish PyCharm from the terminal in the taskbar.  So marketing came to my tool, and made my work environment more beautiful, but less convenient. <br><br>  The second (I do not remember whether it was before or after the icons) was a bad sign that the licensing policy was changed.  No, I do not mind paying for a good product.  It just became a signal that now more attention will be paid to the company's revenues.  So, less attention will be paid to the quality and my needs. <br><br>  The third warning sign was the increase in releases of major versions.  Again, there is nothing wrong with this, if only the company is willing to release stable releases often. <br><br>  And then, finally, something happened that I was afraid of.  From my tool more and more bugs began to come out.  At first it was like an annoying accident.  Then it became obvious that the bows interest the company more than correcting significant errors.  Then such errors began to be found that already directly speak of the not very high quality of the code (or hands).  And so, today I found out that the inherited attributes are not displayed in the class structure in some cases.  What a shame, I shuffle around, but I can‚Äôt find the right tool.  And for at least six months, and maybe more, no one rushes to fix it.  And all this time I fumbled with my hand, and could not understand why the tool helps less and less and bothers me more often. <br><br>  I do not like to base my conclusions on emotions, and therefore I decided to look for at least some objective facts.  Fortunately, JetBrains has a wonderful <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/">YouTrack</a> product, in which all the moves are recorded.  And there you can create reports.  I created the <a href="https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/reports/resolveRate/create">Resolved vs New / Reopened Rate report</a> for the PyCharm product with the ‚ÄúType: Bug‚Äù filter, and I received such a beautiful graph: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f01/355/748/f01355748b6445f0802fea5b7dc4ef59.png"><br><br>  The schedule is beautiful, but in our case it is completely useless.  At first glance, it doesn't matter: the team works, the bugs open and close.  But it seems to me that, behind this wild scatter, one cannot see the true picture (even there one can turn on the ‚ÄúGrouped‚Äù mode, which clarifies a little, but still does not convince).  The effectiveness of data analysis directly depends on how well chosen the method of data presentation.  To understand this data, for starters, I imported it into LibreOffice. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Simple JS script for exporting data to CSV format in case someone suddenly wants to play with statistics</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><pre><code class="javascript">// Replace ID in URL.

        var output = '';
        for (var i = 0; i &lt; groups.length; i++) {
            var el = groups[i];
            output += el.timestamp + ',' + el.positive + ',' + el.negative + '\n';
        }
        console.log(output); 
    }
);
