Moreover, 25% is the peak load, usually a person tends to think less intensively in order to lower the level of energy consumption of the brain to a comfortable 10%. <br><br>  To do this, the brain is able to "turn off" areas that are not needed at any given time, reducing the blood supply to them (as modern processors can turn off their cores). <br><br>  In terms of ‚Äúcomputational abilities,‚Äù the brain logically consists of several systems (like logical groups of specialized cores of a CPU). <br><br>  We will be interested in two - the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">neocortex</a> and the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259B%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">limbic system</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/439/8f7/2eb/4398f72eb9604a5f85baf1919c6930f0.jpg"><br>  <i>Neocortex is gray above.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>The color and signatures are components of the limbic system.</i> <br><br>  <b>The neocortex</b> is the cerebral cortex, which is responsible, among other things, for rational activity and for creativity ‚Äî the creation of what was not there before. <br><br>  This is potentially the most energy-intensive part of the brain.

The search for logic in intuitive decisions is called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_(%25D0%25BF%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2585%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">rationalization</a> ; in fact, this is juggling - the selection of arguments to a ready-made solution. <br><br>  The human limbic system is 98% close to that of higher primates;  to put it bluntly - in her a program of behavior in the monkey pack.  Hence the similarity of certain types of behavior, studied by the science section " <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25AD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Ethology</a> ".

The existence of most cognitive distortions has been described by scientists, and many have been proven in psychological experiments. <br><br>  Cognitive distortions are an example of evolutionary mental behavior.  Some of them perform an adaptive function, since they contribute to more efficient actions or faster solutions.  Others seem to stem from the lack of appropriate thinking skills, or from the inappropriate use of skills that were adaptive in other conditions. <br></blockquote><br>  The cited Wikipedia article lists a list of 61 typical <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2598%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BB%25D1%258E%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F_%25D0%259B%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B">cognitive distortions</a> associated with intuitive decision making. <br><br>  There are articles about intuition errors in the field of logic and probability theory on Habr√©.

But of course, first of all, top-management sets the ‚Äútone from above‚Äù and selects subordinates to match themselves (the so-called ‚Äúnegative selection‚Äù). <br><br>  But most ordinary employees, under normal conditions, agree to delegate the ability to think and decide to someone else.  Almost everyone is happy when someone wise rules them. <br>  I will give this link here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHxTQifVq8J4">Propaganda as an absolute weapon.</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHxTQifVq8J4">Open lecture by Valery Solovya.</a> <br><br>  Look at it, but remember that it is about typical trends in normal calm conditions.  In general, the theory that only 5% of people are ‚Äúpassionaries‚Äù, and 95% - ‚Äúnone‚Äù - is one of the provisions of the old-unkind <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2593%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">Gnosticism</a> . <br><br>  The difficulty is that if you talk with each separately, then it will be a reasonable person, but ... <br><br>  <b>It‚Äôs not a fact that an organization composed of individual good people will also be good and reasonable.</b> <br><br>  If you do not resist, then over time the company will sink to the limbic level. <br>  Therefore, within intellectual, technology companies, they are consciously trying to stop the drift towards limbic management decisions. <br><br>  Google's battle to preserve intelligence: <br><blockquote>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/240849/">However, management in the technology business is still largely based on confidentiality and retention of power ... This is a non-scientific approach to management.</a>  Yes, there are some knowledge that they are trying to convey, but what is taught in business schools is hopelessly outdated - it's the same as teaching a craftsman to use the tool, without explaining how to do a good thing or another useful tool.  Google is trying to use a more scientific approach ... And this is already much better than what happened before or is still happening in any other place where making decisions about further actions is reduced, let's say, to the <b>skills or vision of individuals, their instincts</b> .  Google has probably tried to allow information to rise from bottom to top, to <b>allow everyone to more influence decision-making</b> . </blockquote><br>  In a small company it is easier to keep the intellect: <br><br><blockquote>  @excoder - <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/292686/">In the Russian Federation, I managed to be a co-builder of the company precisely on such principles.</a>  With the proper level of the barrier from more post-Soviet partners, everything is built and works great and long-running.  The main thing is to hire people with the same vision and mentality. </blockquote><br>  Remember how once, in their early years, Yandex and Google were "corporations of good"?  The growth in numbers has contributed to the regress of the internal environment, but at least they are taking measures against it.

Often it is better for him not to admit a mistake, so as not to undermine his authority or the authority of his superiors, so as not to deprive his subordinates of internal confidence ( <a href="http://www.anekdot.ru/id/-42121005/">anecdote to the topic</a> ). <br><br>  But in the world of the mind, on the contrary, it is foolish not to admit the mistake that everyone already sees, they have already appreciated and made their conclusions.  Obstinacy in error only gives food for additional unpleasant conclusions about the qualities of the leader‚Äôs personality, his professional suitability - ‚Äúhe cannot offer anything sensible, and he doesn‚Äôt listen to those who can.‚Äù <br><br>  Intellectual companies, not limbic, invent the future.  Therefore, those large companies that want to take part in creating the future enclose islands of freedom of mind. <br><br>  An example is the allocation of Sberbank IT at Sbertech.  How is the situation with them now I do not know, but the movement in the right direction was made.  Judging by the fact that <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/317730/">they write on Habr√©</a> , in the R &amp; D units Sbertech and now it works well. <br><br>  About what the alternative is, how it works under an incompetent director, there is already an article entitled ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/297678/"><b>How new managers destroy the companies entrusted to them</b></a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  In this case, limbic patterns of behavior ‚Äúdominance‚Äù and ‚Äúprovision of food‚Äù are realized in the form of quite specific <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/301106/"><b>features of the distribution of the wage fund in large enterprises of the Russian Federation</b></a> . <br><br>  And this is not surprising - since for some individuals biological programs can overpower the voice of reason, then what is the Labor Code for them?  Yes, it is simply zero.  And maybe even worse - his violation may bring additional pleasure from the "dominance". <br><br><a name="p42"></a><h2>  4.2.  HRs are different, HRs are different. </h2><br><br>  The specifics of managing a hierarchical pack of primates and the flat structure of an intellectual company are different.  HR support of these different leadership styles is also a different job. <br><br>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/315872/">Pros recruiting agree</a> that the best specialists, creative individuals who, <i>in pursuit of a really interesting project, are ready to sacrifice even personal well-being</i> : <br><br><ul><li>  complexity, scale, non-standard tasks;  better is what no one else has done; </li><li>  management satisfaction plus adequate colleagues with a sense of humor; </li><li>  the compliance of the company's corporate culture with the employee‚Äôs internal values; </li><li>  the ability to work remotely or flexible working hours; </li><li>  presence in the office of recreation rooms, a gym. </li><li>  " <i>comfortable and modern workplace</i> ".

And from there: <br><blockquote>  <i>There are a lot of people who do not want to work more in "cool" companies with their office rats, but want the warm, family atmosphere of <b>small companies</b> .</i> <br></blockquote><br>  Imagine now the situation when the internal environment of the company was ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù - supported by limbic systems by links of the power hierarchy, and the management style acquired a taste of ‚Äú <abbr title="now they speak politely - I feel (!) we will not work together">I am the boss - you are a fool</abbr> ‚Äù.  Regular hypocritical high-level meetings with rehearsed "team questions", fake enthusiasm and other "brand values." <br><br>  What if in such a ‚Äúlimbic‚Äù company try to implement HR projects and processes that relate to the life and development of ‚Äúneocortex‚Äù companies?  Let's look at specific examples of how top management and HR, who ‚Äúoptimized‚Äù their thinking, will <s>distort and</s> adapt sensible approaches to personnel management. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fa6/6eb/986/fa66eb986244444aa007c2722d1c508d.jpg"><br>  <i>Cargo cult - external imitation in the complete absence of understanding of the essence.</i> <br><br><a name="p43"></a><h2>  4.3.  Flat org structure </h2><br>  The flat structure is a natural device of intelligent, technological companies, because the mind does not recognize hierarchy.  There are no authorities for reason, but he will be happy to study the evidence of his statements of interest.  An intelligent person seeks those from whom one can learn, not those to whom one can obey. <br><br>  But what sad results do attempts to introduce a flat structure in a ‚Äúlimbic‚Äù company bring? <br><br>  The flattening of the organizational structure is supposedly carried out for the sake of speed of passing decisions and reducing bureaucracy.  In reality, of course, first of all for the redistribution of payroll of the middle management in favor of the top management. <br><br>  Vykashivaniya middle management in the form of reductions or demotion and salary leads to this: <br><br>  1. The loss of competence in the company, the violation of the processes of internal learning and knowledge transfer.  This is only the limbic top management can be easily changed at least once a quarter ... <br>  2. At the lower level of the employees, the career perspective and the salary increase prospect disappear (see further the paragraph about grades). <br>  3. After mergers / divisions of divisions and redistribution of areas of responsibility, a number of controversial issues arise, to which the high managers have not condescended.  The speed of decision making on these controversial issues drops to zero. <br>  4. The protective barrier between the islands of the mind and the high authorities with intuitive thinking and corresponding <s>alpha characters</s> possesses leadership skills. <br><br><a name="p44"></a><h2>  4.4.  Grading </h2><br>  The introduction of grades gives an assessment of the objective significance of all positions for the Company ... Gives transparent (sometimes they risk to say - fair) rules for the annual increase in salaries for all employees ... Spaceships ply ... <br><br>  Hmm, so - grading is good for everyone, but needs to be adapted to local conditions: <br><blockquote>  <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/859659">Hay's Orthodox system suggests that employees who fall into a higher grade should receive 30% more than those who remained in the previous one.</a>  <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/859659">However, this does not always correspond to the requirements of reality. ... top managers should receive more than what is programmed by the Hay system</a> . <br></blockquote><br>  Mr. Hay‚Äôs weak theory is that the appetites of local top management should be taken into account according to a different theory ‚Äî a <b>constant increase in needs, a constant increase in detachment from employees</b> . <br><br>  I‚Äôm not exaggerating at all, and here‚Äôs a <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/news/333837-glava-pochty-rossii-nazval-peregretoi-situatsiyu-so-svoei-premiei">fresh confirmation</a> from Dmitry Strashnov, General Director of the Federal State Unitary Enterprise ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù, that the <b>system is</b> exactly like this: <br><blockquote>  There is no ‚Äúopportunity for creativity‚Äù in the calculation of its remuneration, since the relevant acts for calculating the premium are applicable to all state-owned companies. <br><br>  If someone considers that they are incorrect, then it is necessary to change the <b>system (remuneration to the heads of state-owned companies)</b> as a whole and recalculate the remuneration to all heads of state-owned companies. <br></blockquote><br>  By the way, bend the theory of Hay should be for employees, but only in the other direction.  Fork z / n set not <a href="http://hrm.ru/db/hrm/F225C7823BBCA1F5C325772C00534B8F/print.html">30%, as in the method</a> , but more - 60%.  Then we will take new employees for 70% of the maximum rate and tell them that they are not taking them to the minimum, but to the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù value.  The next improvement is to generally cancel the lower limit of the plug, one confusion with it.  The rule ‚Äúa subordinate should not receive a salary above the head‚Äù begins to require manual verification ... well, nothing, we can handle it. <br><br>  Well, that's better.  But still not ideal. <br><br>  Then we will give HR this right - by fulfilling our personal goal of constantly reducing the payroll rate, at any convenient moment, lower grades and remove the line management sign at our discretion, without notifying either employees or their managers.  Exactly so - the right, at one‚Äôs discretion, to reconsider the significance of posts in which they do not understand anything!  To do this, it will be necessary to classify grades from both employees and their immediate supervisors ‚Äî middle managers (or they will still tell their subordinates). <br><br>  Now our way.  Do you feel dominated? <br><br>  Stop, we annually increase the payroll by only 3%.  Somehow little comes out at all.  Well, that is, for top management - a little.  It is necessary for them to introduce the possibility of manual installation of increases in the s / n.  And can bring them to a separate payroll?  No, well, you, we are one team.  It is better to let the wage fund be uniform - and it will not be so noticeable which category is actually ‚Äúgrowing‚Äù in s / n. <br><br>  After that, an even lower percentage of payroll increases remains for all employees ... <br>  Damn, not throwing them at 0.3% each - it will look quite mockingly.  It will be necessary to give managers the opportunity to manually distribute the increase according to their subordinates - to someone 3%, and someone without another compensation will be killed for another year. <br><br>  Now is the triumph of transparent salary calculation and payroll distribution. <br><br>  Only after such improvements, Mr. Edward Hay does not recognize his creation, and from the other world wonders - is <b>it not a lot of honor to call ‚Äúthis‚Äù the term ‚Äúgrading‚Äù</b> . <br><br><a name="p45"></a><h2>  4.5.  Annual bonuses by target </h2><br>  For a start, the quarterly premiums will be canceled and leave annual.  By the way, this is an element of <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BC">Taylorism</a> , a trick of 114 years old, aimed at the working class.  Reasonable employees of creative professions catch it right away: <br><br><ol><li>  The employer will make the annual premium less than the sum of the previous quarterly premiums, since  it will psychologically seem more to you in one piece (I say the same - the manual on manipulating the working class from 1903). </li><li>  The size of the annual award depends on the indicators achieved - it is necessary to reach the next step, the effect of ‚Äúself-squeezing of juices‚Äù from employees arises. </li><li>  If a rule is entered into the collective agreement or in the ‚Äúremuneration clause‚Äù that the employee should be registered at the time of the premium payment and pay the last year‚Äôs premium in April of the current year, then it will be possible to make reductions in the personnel after the year‚Äôs close, but . </li></ol><br>  Already not bad, but we will not stop the adaptation of the process of awarding like that half way. <br><br>  Is it true that a commercial company must first of all take care of increasing its revenue, while cost savings are permissible only to the extent that this does not prevent it? <br><br>  Then let's formulate it like this: We reward according to the results of accomplishing group and individual ‚Äúgoals‚Äù.  Requirements for the ‚Äúpersonal goals‚Äù of employees range from 3 to 5 <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART">SMART goals</a> , aimed at increasing revenues and not directly related to job responsibilities.  Nice, concise.  And it's easier for employees not to be scattered, but to focus only on increasing the company's revenue. <br><br>  That's just forgot about the drivers, accounting, sysadmin office systems, etc.  Their attempts to invent such goals for themselves are something.  Who takes too close to the heart - does not withstand such insanity, is dismissed. <br><br>  Oh, and how then does HR itself set goals for itself - are they somehow sideways in increasing revenues? <br><br>  Elementary, Watson - it is not required by them.  This is an HR project, and they will evaluate the goals of the other employees for compliance with the specified criteria, and not vice versa.  So they will choose any formulations of goals for themselves - who will stop them? <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">In due time I, the young system administrator, addressed to the employee of HR ...</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  - of course, I find it difficult to set goals for my revenue, advise how.  She replied that she had no problems, she had already invented 15 formulations.  She herself doesn't even need so much, and she shares them with HR employees ... <br><br>  Well, I looked at her 15 ‚Äúgoals‚Äù - yes, they were potentially useful for the Company, but none were SMART and none had an effect on revenue ... she just did not understand. <br><br>  My second example is even cooler.    ,    6 ,        ‚Ä¶    SMART-    ,  <b> </b> : <br><br> " <i>      </i> ". <br> -,    ‚Äî       . ,       ¬´ ¬ª  SMART-?   ,       ?     ,   ! </div></div><br> ,           .   ,      . <br><br>     ‚Äî      ,   .     :        , ‚Ä¶    ?           ? <br><br>   HR,     ‚Ä¶ <br><br>        100%   ?   ‚Äî <b>   0,8    </b> .         ,      ,     ,      .   ,        ,       100%-  .     20%       ,     ( ),    -    -   . <br><br>       : -,  ,  ‚Äî        .  ¬´ ¬ª ( 4.3)    ,    ,      0,8      . <br><br> :         ‚Äî    0,8  . ,  -   80%,   - .        ¬´ ¬ª‚Ä¶ ,   ?          ? <br><br>                  80%,   ?   ‚Äî  .  ! <br><br> <b>       .</b> <br><br> ,     ,      .   ,        .        ? ,   SMART    ,        ‚Ä¶              .   ,    ,     ,     ,   ¬´  ¬ª. <br><br>   ‚Äî            HR. <br>  ,     -        . <br><br> ,    ,      ‚Äî     . <br><br><a name="p46"></a><h2>  4.6.  </h2><br>   ,   . ,    ‚Äî   ,   ,   . <br><br> <b>  ‚Äî    , ,   .</b> <br><br> ?    ¬´  ¬ª? ¬´   !¬ª <i>(    HR-, )</i> . ¬´  ‚Äî ¬ª. <br><br>  ,            ?     ?    ,      .     ,   ,   , <b>  </b> . <br><br>     HR ‚Ä¶     ‚Ä¶ ,    ¬´¬ª,  -   ¬´¬ª.    <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2588%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D1%2591%25D1%2580%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0_(%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582)">Big-4</a>     ‚Ä¶ <br><br>   HR-  1  ‚Äî        . <br> ,       ?  ,  ,    . <br><br><a name="p47"></a><h2>  4.7.  ¬´¬ª   </h2><br>    /   30% (   ) ‚Äî  - -      .   30%          .  ,   ‚Äî  ,                ,        30%. <br><br>  30%      3% ,    13%‚Ä¶ , , . <br><br>  :         ,   ,       100% ( 2 ),     /?  ,   . -  30%.   .       ?

Based on the thesis ‚Äúthere are no bad people‚Äù, I will assume that the HR director of the mine went to her position with the thought that she would not only be in charge of her director in violation of the Labor Code, etc.  Probably also thought that something would help the employees in their high positions.  However, at the output we have a co-authorship in the development of the KPI system, which economically forced them to violate safety engineering.  Those.  in fact, we are talking about building a system of their gradual suicide, something like a "Russian roulette". <br><br>  There, the link says that for the sake of increasing shareholder profits, but I doubt it.  In the structure of the company's operating costs, salary savings were unlikely to be more than 0.5%.  The option of redistributing the ‚Äúsavings‚Äù payroll in the direction of top management seems to me more likely ... <br><br>  Figuratively speaking, if top management solves the problem of turning a company into a concentration camp, then first of all they turn themselves into SS men.  Human thinking is flexible, and by the time our Stirlitz has achieved the high position of commandant for success in solving tasks of staff reduction, he will become a real exemplary fascist. <br><br>  Deep inside itself, of course, Stirlitz will have <a href="https://otvet.mail.ru/question/15731251">some sort of excuse</a> .  Something like this: <br><blockquote>  I do everything in my power, within the established framework of orders of the authorities and official duties.  I am the most human part of the top management, and I, in my place, soften as much as I can, the orders of the Fuhrer ... The other in my place would not have done that.  It is for this difficult and nervous work that I get such a deservedly large prize. <br></blockquote><br>  If a person has built a concentration camp over the years, and for the success of construction has become his commandant, then his system of internal motivation, self-justification and encouragement has already been rebuilt to the appropriate tasks.  Why on earth would he now seriously announce the conversion of a concentration camp to a club of equal gentlemen? <br><br>  Purely theoretically, under the immense influence of a certain incident, reminiscent of the temporality of his being, he himself can act in an evangelical way: <a href="http://bible.optina.ru/new:mf:19:21"><i>If you want to be perfect, go sell your property and distribute to the poor;</i></a>  <a href="http://bible.optina.ru/new:mf:19:21"><i>and you will have treasure in heaven;</i></a>  <a href="http://bible.optina.ru/new:mf:19:21"><i>and come and follow me (Matthew 19:16)</i></a> <br><br>  Purely theoretically, dear readers, if his family does not have time to pass to a mental hospital. <br><br>  But how will our director be able to demand the same from his ‚Äúcolleagues‚Äù from top management?  No way - they will try to get rid of him and continue to "work." <br>  But if Shtirlitsa is not substituted, his associates-subordinates, realizing that they haven‚Äôt been able to ‚Äúwork‚Äù for long, will launch an operation under the code name <b>Last Hapok</b> . <br><br>  The power hierarchy of a company will work out solutions that do not fit its spirit.  Even ordinary orders are not executed exactly, and it is impossible to order things related to the internal culture, the internal environment. <br><br>  It is impossible to achieve the execution of the order ‚Äúbe good‚Äù or ‚Äústop corruption‚Äù or ‚Äúrecruit only those who are smarter than you‚Äù or ‚Äúbe smart‚Äù by ‚Äústepping over your ego, correct mistakes made under the influence of your intuition‚Äù. <br><br>  Yeah, everyone ran to become disinterested, smart, honest and loyal. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img width="200" src="https://habrastorage.org/files/633/476/c37/633476c37fe742f78fe3c53c380a1e05.jpg"></div><br>  <i>Finding ways to fulfill an order to improve the internal environment of the Company</i> <br><br>  The top management, who did not cope with the work, recognizes his failure and will start re-introducing grades and bonuses?  <a href="http://www.aif.ru/money/business/43058">Will work for 1 dollar</a> ?

The sweetest thing for ‚Äúdominance‚Äù is the ability to dismiss anyone, without legal grounds, and regardless of any consequences for the Company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41e/aa3/40f/41eaa340fe4c40089475fe33998d98dc.jpg"><br>  <i>Allegorical picture illustrating the domination of the limbic system over the neocortex</i> <br><br>  Will the mind then turn on, will the management decisions made by the ‚Äúinner monkey‚Äù correct?  Hardly. <br><br>  As Gilbert Chesterton said, <i>The point is not that they do not see the solution.</i>  <i>The fact is that they do not see the problem.</i> <br><br>  And indeed there is no problem for <i>them</i> - this Company will be bent, pseudo-efficient top managers will fly to another.  In any case, they <i>have</i> already ‚Äúpostponed‚Äù a certain amount of "retirement".  Therefore, <i>they</i> will continue to swagger, experiment and ‚Äúoptimize‚Äù under the guidance of their <i>intuition</i> . <br><br>  <b>Therefore, one should be very skeptical about the hopes of the Company's turnaround to the mind by the forces of the previous bosses.</b> <br><br>  Recently, another experiment began - on the transformation of Sberbank <a href="http://blog.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/2016/07/06/biryuzovye-organizacii-na-praktike/">into something flat and trendy-turquoise</a> ... <br>  Of course, I wish Sberbank success, but I am plagued by vague doubts ... If the ‚Äúdominant‚Äù individuals, having refused the job title ‚Äúdirector ...‚Äù, retain the levers of redistribution of ‚Äúfood,‚Äù then the initial enthusiasm of the others will soon fade in an atmosphere of hypocrisy. <br><br>  Another example: <a href="http://www.comnews.ru/node/100677">Soldatenkov is again at the helm of MegaFon</a> .  There are many enthusiastic comments below the article ... <br><blockquote>  Apr 28, 2016 12:25  This is a great decision ... Soldatenkov will raise the company, as it was before !!!  I was led to work with him both in the Branch and in GO - this is a real leader and professional !!! <br></blockquote><br>  ‚ÄúIt was, it was, but it passed,‚Äù <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DXG9o1GJrsPk">Sophia Rotaru sings</a> . <br><br><blockquote>  Apr 28, 2016 at 11:06 am  In my opinion, this speaks of new trends in our economy.  Time "effective" managers pass.  They are being replaced, as expected, by specialists.  The slogans that "effective" will cope, not the gods burn pots, lose their mandate meaning.  Private capital does not tolerate inept management, it is not state.  shake treasury ... </blockquote><br>  <i>Private capital does not tolerate mismanagement</i> - sorry, this is on what planet? <br>  And also, by what criterion of skill, the owners are evaluated, we do not know, because we do not know their true goals.  It is not enough, the goal may not be an increase in capital in the company, but <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/283974/">its withdrawal to another place</a> . <br><br>  Let's return from speculation to the facts.  The Chairman of the Board of Directors, who coordinated the strategy of the actions of the former CEO, himself becomes the CEO.  What can change from this?  Think, draw your own conclusions. <br>  Although ... should I be clever here, I <s>would have</s> hoped for the best. <br><br><a name="p6"></a><h2>  6. IT life in limb </h2><br>  I reread the article - it somehow turned out gloomy.  But not so scary in life. <br><br>  First, Professor V. Solovey told us that many people usually like it, and this is biologically natural. <br><br>  Secondly, I emphasize once again.  Intuition does not govern everyone and not always.  If you take a t√™te-√†-t√™te talk, then he will take the arguments of reason, especially if he didn‚Äôt have time to blur his decision.  But if he has already managed to spoil - then more difficult, his ego, his "inner monkey" will justify and defend his mistakes to the detriment of the common cause, to the detriment of the company. <br><br>  Thirdly, IT is usually an island of reason and freedom - the specifics of this work. <br>  It is also usually managed by an IT person who understands this specificity.  Only it is necessary to take into account that not every former IT person adopted by the top management will resist the harmful orders of his boss. <br><br>  If at the competition candidates for the position of Director of IT are asked the question ‚Äúhow much are you ready to reduce the number of IT‚Äù, then any doubts will come to mind about the winner of this competition. <br><br>  So it is generally tolerable, but periodically comes the crap, generated by the limbic hierarchy of the power of the company.  Either personal threats, mass demotions, reformatting of areas of responsibility based on intuition or hidden personal goals, then cuts in premiums. <br>  Oh, again lost to the negative.  Let's not talk about this. <br><br>  You just need to understand that in limbic companies: <br><br>  1. All creativity is either copying other people's notions, or the invention and embodiment of the 1001st method of honestly taking money from the population. <br><br>  2. Everything created by you will periodically collapse, and not in the process of replacement for the best.  The true reason is the desire to correct the so-called " <a href="http://lurkmore.to/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA">fatal flaw</a> " of the existing, i.e.  one of the forms of manifestation of dominance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebf/340/fdb/ebf340fdb4e74c1c9938f79d23370eb6.jpg"><br>  <i>There are two types of thinking.</i>  <i>One of them is creative, and the second is concerned with correcting the fatal lack of someone else‚Äôs work.</i> <br><br>  If pseudo-efficient managers with their idea of ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äúoptimization‚Äù are not shielded from IT, then IT will gradually bend down. <br><br>  The best way out in such a situation is ‚Äúdivorce.‚Äù Those who are not able to have their IT will pay someone else. For example, as <a href="http://www.jet.msk.su/services/it-autsorsing-i-tekhnicheskaya-podderzhka/proekty/autsorsing-obsluzhivaniya-it-infrastruktury-oao-vympelkom/">Beeline already does</a> . <br><br><a name="pz"></a><h2>  Conclusion </h2><br>  ‚ÄúWe wanted the best, but it turned out as always,‚Äù and now you know why. <br><br>  The biological principles of energy saving in thinking set the tendency of the internal environment to slide into relationships, like in a monkey pack, to the loss of a collective mind.  And if in school, the army and the prison it is inevitable and they have learned to live with it, in the sphere of intellectual work this creates unjustified problems.  In such conditions, creativity becomes difficult, and the company becomes uncompetitive in a number of ways. <br><br>  However, this condition does not prevent many companies from existing - the state either finances them for a budget account, or provides protection in another form - limiting access to natural resources by potential competitors, passing laws, etc. <br><br>  By the way, in order to secure a comfortable future and cheap labor resources, these companies are interested in suppressing ‚Äúintellectual‚Äù competitors with administrative levers.  For example, <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/267666/">as telecom operators with third-party messengers are trying to do</a> . <br><br>  But small intellectual companies, inventing something fundamentally new, still win the "colossi on clay feet" under the control of intuits, and change the world. <br>  Some of them then become ‚Äúbig‚Äù ... <br><br><a name="pl"></a><h2>  Additional materials </h2><br>  1. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist%3Flist%3DPLfBdaFbgTkfSK8k5dilvGuuRjr9bNsRKd">Dubynin Vyacheslav - Lectures</a> <br><br>  2. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-kOlIWJ8nUs">V.D.</a>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D-kOlIWJ8nUs">Nightingale - How does the propaganda machine work</a> ?
