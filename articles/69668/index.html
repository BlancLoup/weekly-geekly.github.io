Not cheap Chinese plastic masks, but a genuine Taiwanese technological miracle.  With the help of the new <b>ASUS Eee PC T91</b> , even the evil Megatron can be put to shame: he is ashamed to spin and fold as cleverly as the T91 can.  Our laptop is not familiar with the word "No" - for you it will work in any position.  In addition, the T91 screen responds to the user's touch, and try to touch Megatron!  ) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f26/01e/046/f2601e04656b1074bd483d19966d323f.jpg" width="500" height="334"><br><br>  Today, on my desk, I‚Äôm not afraid of the word, a unique exhibit - a <b>ASUS EeePC T91</b> netbook with a rotating touch screen.

      The <b>ASUS EeePCT91 netbook</b> is one of the first netbooks on the market equipped with a touch screen.  Yes, even in the first model of the netbook, craftsmen managed to insert third-party touchscreens, but in this case we are talking about a serial device. <br>  The heart of the netbook this time was the <b><a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D35466%26amp%3Bprocessor%3DZ520%26amp%3Bspec-codes%3DSLB2H">Intel Atom Z520 processor</a></b> (made on 45-nanometer technology, having a clock frequency of 1.33GHz and 512KB L2 cache) on the <b><a href="http://ark.intel.com/chipset.aspx%3FfamilyID%3D35443">Intel SCH US15W chipset</a></b> , which together consume a minimum of power (totally about 4 watts - against 9 watts <b><a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D36331%26amp%3Bprocessor%3DN270%26amp%3Bspec-codes%3DSLB73">Intel Atom 270</a></b> on <b><a href="http://ark.intel.com/chipset.aspx%3FfamilyID%3D35553">Intel 945GSE chipset</a></b> ).  Having a very low heat dissipation, this solution allowed, according to the designers, to do without active cooling. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bdc/f71/8c8/bdcf718c8a1a2356212d44ff8445e550.png" width="390" height="449"><br><br>  Among other things, the <b>Intel SCH US15W</b> chipset has only one chip instead of the north and south bridges, which made it possible to get an additional gain in the size of the motherboard, and consequently in the final size of the device.  Developers decided to achieve complete silence for the little ones using a 16GB solid-state drive.  But this is not all disk space available to the user - another 16GB is available in the DiskExpander (in fact, this is the second card reader) and 20GB in the EeeStorage.  In total, as many as 52 hectares are obtained. <br><br>  The new <b>Intel GMA 500</b> with 8MB of memory is used as a video card :) To complete the theme of megabytes, I‚Äôll say that we have as many as 1024MB of operational DDR2 memory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/05a/ce0/487/05ace0487337583ce1076ce9cf229ff6.png" width="390" height="471"><br><br>  The laptop comes preloaded with <b>Microsoft Windows XP Home</b> , non-standard wallpaper of which can be seen on a screen with a diagonal of 8.9 "and LED-backlit.  With the network, everything is as usual - Bluetooth 2.1 and Wi-Fi 802.11b / g / n. <br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  In a small box, in addition to the netbook <b>ASUS EeePC T91</b> , are: <br><br>  - AC adapter and power cord; <br>  - User's manual; <br>  - Case; <br>  - Drives with software. <br><br>  At this time, the case is different from those in other trim levels - instead of a zipper, it opens by tilting the top part like an envelope.  There are small leather inserts with the company logo. <br>  I always read the manuals, but a lot of useful information is found, as it turned out, on the device itself. <br><br>  The AC adapter is nothing special - the usual size and bright blue LED. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The netbook has dimensions (in mm) 225x164x25.2 ~ 28.4, weight with a battery of 960 grams and will be available in two colors - black and white.  Both versions are made in glossy plastic, which is quite soiled.  Like all the latest innovations, the surface of the case is made using <b>ASUS Infusion</b> technology, which gives the case some resistance to inevitable scratches and abrasions.  I will add this: this netbook is smaller than the first ‚Äúhedgehog 701‚Äù in size and weight, but surpasses it in screen size and in almost all other parameters.  T91 can be easily lost on the bookshelf. <br>  The designer, who designed the case, decided it minimalistically, without departing from geometric primitives.  The netbook case is rectangular, with clear edges. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f26/01e/046/f2601e04656b1074bd483d19966d323f.jpg" width="500" height="334"><br><br>  On the lid is the inscription <b>Eee</b> (who does not remember or does not know, it is - <em>Easy to learn, Easy to work, Easy to play</em> ), below which is an insert made of metal with fine grinding;  it contains the name of the model and two indicators. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/974/aef/680/974aef6800c3c405626a31d330f6f834.jpg" width="500" height="383"><br><br>  A metal mechanism is attached to this structure, which is responsible for turning the screen around its axis and for tilting it in all directions.  More than 180 degrees the screen does not recline;  thus, having two degrees of freedom, the screen can be positioned almost as desired. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73d/b0e/137/73db0e1374353f041f7a40ade4eb2d46.jpg" width="500" height="277"><br><br>  This can be useful to students and schoolchildren - turned 180 degrees or even removed the keyboard under the screen, hid the desks on the shelf and rolled up slowly, rolling.  Fans of reading will also like such a constructive feature - wrapped the cover of the book and is ready. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c09/72f/dee/c0972fdeeee68a309eaf7d6cfd1f9378.jpg" width="500" height="340"><br><br>  On the reverse side, in addition to 4 rubber feet, an unusually small number.  From the available - a pair of ventilation "gills", a pair of stickers and a system cover on two screws. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b5e/dc1/15a/b5edc115aafe5013677babed1d0c6d39.jpg" width="500" height="314"><br><br>  I did not take it off, but I suspect that there is a memory bar hiding there.  Thus, the battery is non-removable, which is not very good.  On the other hand, on the "belly" there is nothing distracting. <br><br>  Minimalism reigns on the back of the netbook - there is nothing besides the VGA port and anti-theft lock. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e6/1ca/994/9e61ca994473729a1ac1edc181acb8b0.jpg" width="499" height="176"><br><br>  On the left side are the power connector, USB port (2.0) and the so-called Disk Expander (for MMC / SD / SDH cards).  Another card reader is located on the front of the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/868/066/efa/868066efa70fa4a276509a08cc6773e9.jpg" width="500" height="151"><br><br>  On the right side of the netbook is a network RJ-45 connector, another 1 USB port, two jacks for connecting headphones and a microphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50b/15f/b1c/50b15fb1c3869bfb2b8621546eb2cbe0.jpg" width="500" height="165"><br><br>  At the corner is a small metal cap - nothing more than a stylus. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28d/964/1a8/28d9641a85396f6776cb7ca8b1c672c6.jpg" width="500" height="308"><br><br>  He pulls out and moves apart;  it is quite convenient to use because of its size and rough coating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ad/6f5/84b/6ad6f584bc939d425cc5363f613a09bd.jpg" width="500" height="200"><br><br>  <b>Screen</b> <br>  I think now we can talk about the "monitor" part.  Despite the fact that the screen diagonal is only 8.9 ‚Äù, it has the same resolution as its‚Äú older ‚Äù10.1‚Äù brothers - 1024x600 (WSVGA).  In stock LED illumination thanks to which eyes from the image do not get tired at all.  However, the image is not always ‚Äúon top‚Äù - in bright sunshine, you can comfortably use the device only in the shade (at least your own).  The screen is glossy - in the dark pictures you will clearly see your reflection.  And due to the fact that it is sensory, fingerprints are added to the reflections as well as such an unpleasant appearance of artifacts.  Yes, yes, there is a stylus in the kit ... but it‚Äôs so tempting to move along digital interfaces with ordinary fingers!  In addition, the interface for this is more than adapted. <br><br>  Above the screen is a 0.3 megapixel camera, which provides a fairly good image for its class.  On the other hand, for Skype, often more is needed. <br><br>  Under the screen are two buttons;  one (made in the form of a return slider) - turns on the laptop, the second - when pressed normally, switches various interfaces of the device, and when held, rotates the image in increments of 90 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dec/ee4/2a0/decee42a0dd294c9571d50e361502dcf.jpg" width="500" height="321"><br><br>  On the right side there are four indicator points.  By the way, thanks to this opportunity to "spin", the device can find a lot of applications - a regular netbook, a PDA for reading, a photo frame and, perhaps, something else.  Super. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/236/2dc/de5/2362dcde56cfa661d72b086092a39406.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As for the sensory properties - this, of course, is not a Wacom tablet, so there are no hundreds of levels of sensitivity to pressing and tilting here.  I will say more - not even a multitouch.  But this is the first touchscreen among netbooks, which you can find many uses! <br>  It is very sensitive - it can upset what you have to write all the time almost on weight, which is somewhat inconvenient.  Otherwise, there will be unscheduled scribbles under the place of contact between the hand and the screen. <br><br>  <b>Keyboard</b> <br>  The keyboard is quite compact, but a full-fledged layout without a digital part barely fit on a small case.  The buttons are smaller than usual, which is why you will not accelerate much when typing.  Holders of thumbs may also experience some discomfort when printing.  Another thing that didn‚Äôt like it was the right Shift that left to the right, a small ‚Äúslash‚Äù above Enter, the lack of separation of the F1-F12 group of buttons ‚Äî we all used to orient ourselves on the keyboard in the dark along the ‚Äúgap‚Äù between them.  There was no Cyrillic layout in the test sample, but this will be corrected with the arrival on the Russian market. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea2/a43/10f/ea2a4310f3211a5c37bbc4663db2173a.jpg" width="500" height="375"><br><br>  Despite all the above-mentioned "disadvantages", the keyboard is not much different from other netbook keyboards - you can print, even if this takes a little time to get used to.  A little further I will talk about alternative input methods. <br><br>  <b>Touchpad</b> <br>  Well, yes, and what a netbook without a touchpad!  Regarding this model - here the touch panel of sufficient size, with rounded corners, not depressed - there will not be as much dust in the corners as it could be.  The right and left buttons are made with one continuous key. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5fe/96c/b89/5fe96cb89d7f34fb0e0fdb568b82ac14.jpg" width="500" height="396"><br><br>  It is very convenient to use such a touchpad, but almost all the time I used only the screen, having turned the keyboard under it. <br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  The notebook turns on by deflecting the button on the left side of the case under the screen - right after that the blue power indicator lights up.  To say that the device is very quiet - to diminish its dignity.  The netbook works completely silently!  This is achieved due to the fact that there are no coolers inside at all (the new <b>Intel Atom Z 520</b> heats up quite a bit), and an SSD disk is used instead of a regular hard disk.  Thanks to the use of the latter, you can be minimally worried about data integrity, because breaking a flash drive is much more difficult than the fragile mechanics of a regular hard disk.  And yet, I urge to treat any equipment carefully and carefully. <br>  Loading the operating system proceeds quite quickly, which can be seen on the video in this article.  Or, if you're interested, it's about 40 seconds from the moment you press the button.  For some time, there is a launch of an abundant number of programs prescribed in the autorun;  As a rule, many of them are not needed, so if you wish, you can optimize the loading time well by conjuring in the registry editor and services. <br>  The device does not heat up on either side at all, which is also nice. <br><br>  Initially, some functional elements of the operating system are slightly larger than the standard size - the same folding and closing buttons, headers;  This is done for the convenience of using a laptop with your fingers. <br><br>  You can type text on the keyboard, but what if you want to remove it, leaving only the screen in front of your eyes?  Hah ... PDA users already know what to do!  There are several text entry modes to choose from: <br>  - <b>Recognition of entered scribbles</b> .  Those.  you draw a certain abstract form with a stylus or finger and a smart machine immediately offers several options that are most similar to a worm.  You can choose a language, among the symbols of which recognition will occur.  A choice of 15 languages, including Russian.  In addition, you can adjust the speed of input and character recognition, the thickness of the drawn lines. <br>  - <b>Handwriting input</b> .  Very interesting way, but the slowest.  You draw each sign separately and it is inserted the way you painted it.  Thanks to this method, it becomes possible to enter absolutely any characters, a wide variety of characters and drawings.  For writing electronic lectures on technical sciences - the most it! <br>  - <b>On</b> - <b>screen keyboard</b> .  A familiar thing, realized beautifully and conveniently.  Imagine: a resizable regular keyboard, only on the screen - something like Optimus.  Chose Russian and enter the Cyrillic alphabet.  I wanted something else - changed and ready.  With a certain dexterity, this method allows you to type quickly enough; however, the absence of tactile feedback does not make the typing process easy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cb3/41e/c5c/cb341ec5c371308e45020fa6dbffdcf6.png" width="500" height="361"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d44/1cd/e18/d441cde1881152839781ac6b2505f6bf.png" width="500" height="361"><br><br>  Thus, you can enter information inside the T91 in as many as four different ways that will suit almost any area of ‚Äã‚Äãactivity! <br><br>  In normal operation mode, the lithium-polymer battery allows you to stretch the pleasure for about 5 hours - this result is achieved in the power saving mode, with communication modules turned off and 40% of screen backlight. <br><br><h2>  Software </h2><br>  After starting the system, a small tongue is visible at the very top - if you press it with a stylus or any limb, a full pop-up <b>Eee Docking Touch</b> panel will appear at the top. <br>  All programs in it are divided into categories;  I will tell only about the most interesting (if you are interested, you can search the rest in Google, keywords - Eee @ Vibe, Eee Sharing, Eee Storage, Eee Xperience, SRS, Live Update, Super Hybrid Engine). <br><br>  <b>Memos</b> <br>  Sticky leaves - without them, as without a touchpad, it is impossible.  The shell, on the left side of which there are functional elements - a button for creating a new leaflet, a choice of line thickness, an eraser, ink color. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0d4/27f/dbc/0d427fdbcab05e8150936115f5c11df0.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  Further down the center, in fact, is the sheet itself - you can write on it with your finger or stylus, while the sheet can be expanded to full screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d07/ce4/11b/d07ce411b647b269e2c4087f0bb5942f.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  On the right side there is another functional panel, on which there are 3 buttons.  The first (Post to my desktop) sends a list to the desktop;  the second (Send to my friends) allows you to share scribbles with friends via an email program;  and the third button, the last, beautifully removes the leaf. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4b9/8fa/a8b/4b98faa8b16383500566f91d4f415221.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  At the very bottom, under the sheets, there is an entire panel set aside - it is always clear what has already been created, you can always switch. <br>  After closing this application, on the desktop are visible "sent to the desktop" notes that can be made on top of all windows.  They can also be moved, hidden or deleted. <br><br>  <b>Calculator</b> <br>  Initially - just a calculator with large buttons, on the right of which there is a place under the record (the same leaves, only without sending to the desktop).  The choice of two tools - pen and eraser.  A new note created by ‚Äúflipping‚Äù over a corner is cute, but without feedback, of course, not that. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/15a/f8c/f5b/15af8cf5b5e8e4c112aea22ac77c8db3.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  If desired, the calculator can take an engineering look. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/07e/b44/437/07eb44437c319f58ae6cddc9849b9c9a.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  <b>Notepad</b> <br>  The tool that I liked the most and which I would use more often than all the others combined.  Yes, yes, notepad! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/486/812/7ff/4868127ff71beb0bc9bf60ef7be166ec.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  When launching a notebook, the shell prompts you to enter the name of a new document (for example, via the on-screen keyboard) and select a document type ‚Äî an arbitrary sheet where you can write and draw in any order;  or a sheet with "lines", where the text will be entered exactly as we used to.  I almost always chose the latter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/491/f38/087/491f38087dd4b18d4d18fe72bbf8a1c8.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  There are a few more elements to choose from than in Memos.  More precisely - ink, eraser, ink color, input method, tool for moving and highlighting text. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d25/d2d/0f2/d25d2d0f22dac8fa22b2262e31c3d341.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  Above is a finger-optimized panel - creating a document, opening, saving, canceling, sending, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/585/809/831/585809831174f755a38ab49ac2316ab2.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  You can use any of the above input methods. <br><br>  <b>FotoFun</b> <br>  Also a very interesting tool.  This module allows you to interactively view photos - just flipping through them one by one, making also a slide show;  or make a digital photo album. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/006/1ab/fc1/0061abfc14ac7a42f49a93500ba2060d.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  You simply indicate the folder where you have the photos - after a while their thumbnails appear on the desktop, scattered in a different order. <br><br>  They can move, twist, watch.  The photo album is created by pressing the corresponding button - first you need to select the cover, then enter a description of the album;  then choose a photo ‚Äúbefore kata‚Äù and only then do filling in digital pages. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd2/6ac/4a0/cd26ac4a074bf3d08e067f0b3dc189d6.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  You can choose the number of photos on the page, make captions for them, drag and drop frames into pages from the bottom stack, swap, rotate, change the brightness ... in my opinion, entertainment a couple of times, but how spectacular! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0ec/5ba/9d5/0ec5ba9d598a29a6f57f1950d6cfa40a.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  <b>IE toolbar</b> <br>  In fact, this is a small add-on for Internet Explorer, which allows you to control it with your fingers.  In addition, a scroll bar appears to select the scale;  and you can move around the page smoothly with gestures. <br><br>  The next interesting innovation was the so-called <b>TouchGate</b> .  The so-called interface, which can be switched between modes by pressing a button under the monitor screen. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b2f/03e/610/b2f03e610acb8c1dda809cd50a9551a0.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  There are three interfaces to choose from - the Windows desktop, the widgets page and the <b>TouchSuite</b> page. <br>  If we have already accumulated enough with the usual desktop, the other two modes are something new. <br>  On the page of widgets you can display any information - weather, exchange rates, quotes, calendar, time, etc.  - I, frankly, do not like all these ryushechek, but everything is done surprisingly carefully, functionally and beautifully. <br>  On the <b>TouchSuite</b> page (I remind you that you can switch between modes not only with a button, but also with gestures across the screen "right / left") there are the same programs that are offered in Eee Docking Touch.  It is made, apparently, for those who are tired of the standard desktop.  Beautiful icons that can be rotated clockwise or against it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e36/ea6/fcf/e36ea6fcf7a28f945dc66a2519f761c4.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  You can remove or add something from the elements.  Under the "semi-circle" is the slider, which can switch this page to another one, where other, unused icons will be presented;  with the ability to drag them up. <br>  On the same interface, you can make some settings - to resolve the issue with the current date and time; <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c7/098/ef3/8c7098ef39c0ae990d7d93af763517dc.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  find out the battery charge (as well as select the performance mode from the new-fashioned <b>ASUS Super Hybrid Engine</b> program), adjust the volume;  connect wireless and even deal with the mail. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dea/553/751/dea55375182c7d405dbc4d036f8f3823.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  Among other things, you can make an unscheduled screen calibration. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/792/259/ef4/792259ef4568b278c10494da5328521d.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br>  There is also a pre-installed 60-day trial office and Norton 2009. <br><br>  <b>BUT AND THIS IS NOT ALL!</b>  Make an order right now ...) <br>  As a gift to the netbook you get a free shell for the operating system, made specifically for children. <br>  No kidding - it is.  At first you can set up ‚Äúparental control‚Äù - set a password so that you can exit the child mode only by using it.  This shell is <b>called MagicDesktop</b> ;  It is designed for children from 2 to 10 years and it is logical to assume that in it the child will not be able to mess things up with the system of something terrible. <br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In fact, this is just a desktop with a colorful cartoon image, on which all sorts of "children's labels". There are a dozen different applications to choose from, which you can carry away a child ... and what‚Äôs the point of concealing - he got carried away. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e58/867/a92/e58867a92734ea100d754aa7a64f808c.png" width="500" height="292"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">There are just games, there are applications that can work, for example, with a webcam.

This ‚Äúsomething‚Äù is the simplest arithmetic, but nobody will teach them anything. Immediately sent to the "open voyage" - set an example, and we must solve. On the other hand, it can be much more interesting for a child than writing examples of a child on paper.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db4/873/34a/db487334aec173cb7f278cd3cfa0baac.png" width="500" height="358"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">This, of course, not all, but talking about a netbook, and not about childish pranks. Perhaps, I agree that such a device will cause serious interest in children, starting from the very young age ... but I would not dare to give his son from the very start. First, the toy is still expensive to, for example, inadvertently squeeze out the screen or fill the keyboard with saliva. Secondly, I want to ‚Äúpull‚Äù the child away from this ominous blue screen, because of which interest is lost so quickly to many more important things. But, I have to admit, ASUS‚Äôs concern has pleasantly surprised me.</font></font><br><br><h2>  Performance </h2><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">You could already estimate the load time of the operating system - I think this is a very good indicator. But for the sake of completeness, I will cite a few ‚Äúparrots‚Äù from synthetic tests and compare them with some other EeePC models. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So, the Pi number up to a millionth sign in the wonderful program </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">SuperPi 1.5</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> counts in </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">107.609</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> seconds, that is a little faster than two minutes. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/07b/171/faf/07b171faf4eb7eceb7a4691b1cd361f0.png" width="311" height="302"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For comparison, </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ASUS EeePC 1005</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> with an </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Intel Atom 280 processor</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> (1.66GHz) does the same in 89.594 seconds, and </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">ASUS Ares</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> gaming station </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">with an </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Intel Core 2 Quad Q9450</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> processor </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">in 17 seconds :-) </font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">CPU</font></b></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Test </font></font><b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">FreeBenchmark 2.2</font></font></b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">after the math test gave the time 85.24 seconds.

The maximum speed is (Mb / s) 61.8, the average is 54.3 and the minimum is 43.8. Yes, for someone it may be not enough, but it must be admitted that not even every hard disk embedded in netbooks has such a speed. Immediately the speed is constant, and the work is silent. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/2d9/17b/e50/2d917be501d2ff1a3a26088237a8248c.png" width="500" height="444"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, the random access time here will be less than on the magnetic counterparts. </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d50/f68/9ea/d50f689ea279097133e31afbd013b45d.png" width="500" height="444"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Summing up the above, the netbook‚Äôs performance will definitely be enough for such classes as ICQ communication while listening to music, surfing the Internet and writing text in the trial version.
