But before they undressed for foreign audiences.  Yes, Internet sex was developed ‚Äúthere‚Äù, but not with us.  <strong>Now everything seems to be changing</strong> , large companies are coming to our market. <a name="habracut"></a>  Today, as I was able to find out, there are five such projects in runet, but not one of them was done professionally, says the head of Ruskam.  I don‚Äôt know how much this is true, but in any case, the head of this project agreed to get in touch with me and answer frank questions, so I‚Äôm writing about him and not about other projects (by the way, I don‚Äôt know much about it on the network found only video-girl)

      So, all the same, besides the naked women, I was interested in <strong>how it all worked out from the inside, from a technical point of view and a business point of view.</strong> <br><br>  Having written off with the project manager (his name is Sergey, by the way), I managed to find out that: <br><br>  Any adult girl who has a camera, a tripod, a computer, a microphone, headphones and what to see can play the role of undressing.  However, it seemed to me - most of the girls work in studios, that is, they are not sitting at home, but come as a job ( <em>although why ‚Äúhow‚Äù</em> ) to special studios, where she has a working place ( <em>lying down</em> ), and everything is technically equipped.  Sergey does not deny this, and adds that many models work simultaneously on a dozen sites.  And still, preference is given to foreign audiences, because there are well-to-do men there are clients of such a resource, and we still have more teenagers who <strong>really want an aunt to show sisi, but no money</strong> .  So it turns out that further free chat ( <em>free chat, when the girl is dressed, and you can talk with her before you take in private. And if you persuade well, then something can show a glimpse</em> ) it does not work.  But all this, it is worth noting, only my observations as a result of a two-day stay on the site and communication with other users and models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/89a/211/7db/89a2117db1875608d33f74f3412e8d76.jpg" width="450" height="194" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  Today, the cost of one minute of talk is about <strong>$ 2</strong> , of which <strong>70 cents are received by the model</strong> .  The site is only 3 days old, and already 20 registered models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/022/386/ca9/022386ca9ff88d3b816446778e381da2.jpg" width="450" height="422" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  True, Sergei notes that these girls were in the wings, and they did not have to look specifically for them.  And the plans (in a year) are about 2000 models and that one hundred of them are constantly on-line. <br><br>  <strong>So, STOP!</strong>  <strong>And what am I describing everything in my own words?</strong>  <strong>I think it would be appropriate here to quote excerpts from our interview with Sergey.</strong>  <strong>So,</strong> <br><br>  <strong>Sergey, tell us about this business:</strong> <br>  The adult business (adult business from English) in Russia has a huge scale.  People constantly gather at the conference.  There are annual events.  In Russia, I think in this field of activity no less than 100,000 people are employed in one way or another (models, cameramen, photographers, designers, lawyers, etc.).  This is a big business, with a lot of money. <br><br>  <strong>Are you the owner of this business?</strong> <br>  So far, Ruskamz is a hobby and not a business. <br>  Every minute a widow costs us is more expensive than what it costs for a client for a model, for traffic, for visitors. <br><br>  <strong>But you said it was a big business.</strong> <br>  Well, there is still selling video, online sex shops, dvd mail, dating, intimate, Internet TV in the end :) A camera is a new direction. <br><br>  <strong>Well, abroad, as far as I know this has long appeared.</strong> <br>  We have a new one :-) in our company. <br><br>  <strong>Where are you located?</strong> <br>  Who are we"?  Personally, I am now in St. Petersburg, and we have an office in Prague. <br><br>  <strong>By the way, why in Holland and not in Russia?</strong> <br>  because in Russia there will be scoundrels in the bodies that will begin to extort money.  Everything is organized abroad by clients only in Russia, models from the CIS mainly (Ukraine, Moldova, Latvia and so on ...). <br><br>  <strong>Is it difficult to search for models?</strong> <br>  There are plenty of potential models for every second girl between the ages of 18 and 25; Agents will agree to work; there are agents who are looking for models :) Here‚Äôs how to train models yes - you need to be able to <br><br>  <strong>And what conditions and bans you put them?</strong> <br>  Nobody sets anything to the models. They work as they see fit. We don‚Äôt influence it, we just prohibit to bring men into the frame, because they can already pull on porn with men.  Although in Russia there is no article prohibiting porn, nevertheless it does not interfere with initiating criminal cases.  In Russia there is an article prohibiting the illegal dissemination of porn, just as there is an article for illegal business, which means that the article is blanket-that is, it refers to other subordinate acts and there is no act.  That is, any distribution of porn is legal in accordance with the constitution, but criminal cases are initiated.  I myself am now in a criminal case for the fifth month ... or rather not me, but I suffered from the case. <br><br>  <strong>Are you ready to open some trade secrets and tell about the technical part of the project?</strong> <br>  Ready <br><br>  <strong>Only if possible with specific numbers and ...</strong> <br>  But they need to prepare, besides, I now have to go to the meeting.  Let's meet later, I'll think about it for now ... <br><br>  +++++++++++++++ <br>  <strong>That's how our interview ended.</strong>  <strong>More precisely, I hope that is not over.</strong>  Therefore, I kindly request to everyone, if you liked the article, firstly to help get her to the main page ( <strong>plus</strong> ), and secondly, write questions in the kamentah <strong>that I could ask Sergey</strong> .  <strong>What are you interesting in?</strong> <br><br>  By the way, I decided to try it myself ... I tried it.  How it was?  I'll tell you in the second part, along with the answers to your questions ... And I will try to screenshots to put the girls in the work, if it is not prohibited here ;-) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/20626/">https://habr.com/ru/post/20626/</a></p>
