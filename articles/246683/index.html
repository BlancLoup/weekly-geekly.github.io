But that is not all!  We continue the conversation: <b>how to work with traditional marketing techniques on the Internet, what they say about all this in the West, and how to use the salinity card</b> ? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Work with traditional marketing tools (adjusted for Internet reality)</b> <br><br>  Not all principles of traditional marketing and sales psychology can be used on the Web, but some seem designed for this!

      <b>Rule 6 seconds.</b>  People do not realize this, but more often (in 80% of cases) they buy what their eyes fell on in the first 6 seconds of choice.  So show what should be sold as actively as possible.  This can be implemented, for example, using a pop-up window (it may appear 5 seconds after the user has accessed the page). <br><br>  A similar phenomenon is <b>the anchor effect</b> .  Its essence is that the first sentence is perceived as a "starting point" and all further arguments about the attractiveness of other proposals come from it. <br><br>  <b>Cross-recommendations.</b>  Standard trick of personal sales.  Based on the fact that upon completion of the purchase, the person is not just told ‚ÄúThank you, goodbye‚Äù, but offer a related product or service.  So sell much easier!  After all, the person has already bought from you, he trusts you.  It is necessary to strike iron ...!  That is - show related products not only on the page, but also when placing an order. <br><br>  <b>The principle of limitation</b> (or the principle of scarcity).  What is unavailable or seems so, automatically becomes more attractive.  Show that there are few goods left (time counters until the end of the action, limited series of goods, time-limited opportunity to take part in closed testing of goods - all this will help you!). <br>  The cognitive dissonance.  Much can be achieved on its basis!  For example, how would a user of a professional website respond when he saw a window with something like this: ‚ÄúYou are not a real lawyer if ...‚Äù?  Most will follow the link you suggest to find out who, and why, dares to accuse of professional unsuitability. <br><br>  <b>The effect of social proof</b> (it is also called the herd instinct).  If everyone will / have / read - why am I worse?  The confirmation may be the likes of social networks, the number of purchased goods, reviews, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a4/13e/20e/2a413e20e956458189d92e2b3f8e4fab.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>And what about the West?</b> <br><br>  Initially, neuromarketing originated in the West, but is this approach used now?  Apparently - YES.  Here is a recent example.  In one of his recent speeches, Andy Crestodina says that neuromarketing is one of the most effective approaches for those who work with site conversion. . <br>  As an example, he cites the following data: <br><br><ul><li>  McDonald's in their advertising campaigns are constantly talking about billions and billions of customers - what is this, if not the social proof mentioned above?  At the same time, Andy says that it is wrong to place reviews on a separate page, to which a significant part of clients may simply not reach.  Not!  It is much more correct to place social evidence on the most conspicuous places to be seen at once. </li><li>  In Basecamp, an increase in conversion of 102% was noted after they introduced a picture of the person who describes the product to the site. </li><li>  And on the landing page of Google Analytics there is a photo of a woman who is literally happy using this tool.  This image is even more credible because specific data are indicated here (place of work, position, etc.).  Here is another picture from the same series: </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/938/765/64b/93876564b663418d9079cafdbaf2cc2b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Is it possible to automate all this, so as not to study the reactions of people every time?</b> <br><br>  Despite the fact that computational neurobiology and neuropsychology are developing quite actively, unfortunately, it is impossible to automate the process of studying brain activity 100%.  But some things you can trust cars.  For example, the definition of salinity (in other words, the possibility of certain elements of the image to attract attention).  With the help of a special program, you can calculate where the gaze of the person who views the picture will fall. <br><br>  It turns out something like a heat map.  It is clear that the elements to which it is necessary to attract maximum attention should be in the places indicated in the figure. <br><br>  Yes, it‚Äôs not so cheap (usually a few hundred dollars), but if it‚Äôs about a really large-scale advertising campaign with a considerable budget, it‚Äôs better to analyze people's reactions in advance so as not to waste money.  How reliable is this?  Something like this (on the left side is the opinion of the program, on the right side - real people): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/191/d53/649/191d53649ecb4dbe906def6319b52113.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  That is, we repeat: without testing with real people and neuromarketing tools - not enough.  If there is no financial ability to conduct tests with a truly large number of respondents, then the ideal solution is to compare the results obtained with a small group with what the machine issued. <br><br>  <b>Well, how?</b>  <b>Want to try?</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246683/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246683/</a></p>
