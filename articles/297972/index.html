  <section class="page js-page"><h1>London taxi drivers launched a crowdfunding campaign to ‚Äúdrive out‚Äù Uber from the city</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The confrontation of black cabs in London (Black cabs) and taxi service <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uber">Uber</a> , it would seem, has lost its sharpness compared to last year.  The strikes of London taxi drivers stopped.  But maybe this confrontation simply took on a more sophisticated form? <br><br>  A group of sympathetic London taxi drivers are hoping to seize the initiative through the use of crowdfunding.  Artemis Mercer, the wife of one of the taxi drivers, launched a crowdfunding campaign to get a review of the 2012 decision of the authorities.  It was then that the authorities in London allowed Uber to work in the city on special conditions. <br><br>  London taxi drivers and their supporters consider this decision a mistake.  In their opinion, the taxi service is still semi-legal.  Uber and traditional taxi drivers are regulated differently and are not in a single legal field.  The authorities turn a blind eye to the fact that random people are involved in transportation.  And this is a direct threat to public safety. <a name="habracut"></a>

      In addition, the price policy of Uber is reduced, by and large, to the commonplace dumping, London taxi drivers believe.  Well, in the race called ‚Äúwho is cheaper‚Äù the advantage of Uber is obvious. <br><br>  Artemis Mercer plans to collect about 600 thousand pounds (about $ 850 thousand) in the crowdfunding <a href="http://www.crowdfunder.co.uk/Action-for-Cabbies">platform</a> .  This is enough to cover the costs of applying for a review of the decision of the authorities on licensing and regulating Uber.  However, in case of a successful start of the proceedings, supporters of taxi drivers will need additional funds for further legal costs. <br><br>  This amount to be collected in eight weeks.  Then Mercer will be able to file a lawsuit, which, however, will be considered no earlier than June 2016, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/01/18/londons-black-cabs-turn-to-crowdfunding-to-fight-uber/">writes</a> TechCrunch. <br><br>  In November, Uber was able to ‚Äúdrive out‚Äù of three cities in Germany.  Now the taxi service remained only in Berlin and in Munich.  It is worth noting that in comparison with the London colleagues, German taxi drivers were more persistent and quick in their efforts to protect the market of taxi companies from the encroachments of the online service. <br><br>  In London, taxi drivers have been protesting against Uber for four years, but so far without any special results.  As Mercer explains, in London, the taxi market is highly fragmented, companies are divided.  Therefore, these years have gone on to unite in a single desire to repel the "invader". </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297972/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297972/</a></p>
