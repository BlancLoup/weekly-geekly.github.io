This time we will talk a little <s>more</s> than about cellular communication, namely about space. <br>  While the ships plow the expanses of the universe ... oh, not that ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  July 29, 2009 On July 27, 2009, the III International Scientific and Practical Conference "Satellite Technologies in the Service of Railway Transport" (no matter how I wanted, could not attend it) and the exhibition "Cosmotrans-2009", held in Moscow.  The project was organized by the Russian Railways OJSC and the Research and Design Institute of Informatization, Automation and Communication in Railway Transport OJSC. <br>  At the conference, they tried to determine the direction of development of satellite technologies in railway transport, optimize the management of the transportation process, train traffic, as well as ensure the safety of passenger and freight traffic and determine the directions for using GLONASS / GPS satellite data in information management systems. <br>  According to the M2M telematics specialists present, equipping each car with a satellite monitoring system allows you to control the composition and location of each formed electric train.  As part of this task, the possibility of controlling the working time of the personnel of electric trains in real scale (conductors, police officers) is realized. <br>  All this, gentlemen, has been proposed to be implemented on the family of their BusinessNavigator¬Æ systems.  This family includes: <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>BN-Global¬Æ</b> Providing monitoring of the location and condition of vehicles and other controlled objects at the right time at any point on the globe <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>BN-City¬Æ</b> Providing monitoring of the location and condition of vehicles and other controlled objects at the right time, working mainly in the city and region <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>BN-City¬ÆComplex</b> Ensuring monitoring of the location and condition of vehicles and other controlled objects at the right time, working mainly in the city and region for companies with a large vehicle fleet <br>  ‚Ä¢ <b>BN-City¬ÆPersonal</b> Providing monitoring of the location and control of mobile employees at the right time, working mainly in the city and region <br>  If anyone is interested in details, you can view the <a href="http://www.m2m-t.ru/">prospectus</a> <br><br>  At that time, at the CosmoTrans-2009 exhibition, specialists from Russian Navigation Technologies (RNT), who presented their developments for the rail industry based on the AutoTracker GLONASS / GPS vehicle monitoring system. <br><br>  The work of the AutoTracker system is based on satellite communications and is capable of solving a number of urgent tasks at the enterprises of the railway industry.  For example, the AutoTracker system will be indispensable for constant monitoring of the speed and location of trains, which will help to maintain the timetable and reduce the risk of accidents.  It is possible to increase the reliability of transportation by installing autonomous on-board modules on containers.  Thus, it will be possible to monitor on-line the location of the cargo and rolling stock, including  facts of wagging or removal of containers from the train.

      In addition, AutoTracker can monitor, control temperature, and manage railway refrigeration containers and generating sets.  To do this, the specialists of Russian Navigation Technologies have developed a specialized solution with functions to ensure the specified temperature in the container, remotely control diesel generator sets, monitor the state of a number of container and engine parameters ‚Äî coolant temperature, oil pressure, battery charge, level fuel, temperature of the internal and external environment, and more, and informing dispatchers about the parameters outside the permissible limits. <br><br>  The AutoTracker system can also be successfully applied on static objects.  For example, by installing door-opening sensors, you can instantly track unauthorized entry into a car or container. <br><br>  As always, at the conference and at the exhibition, people shared their experience; special attention should be paid to the experience of European colleagues.  If only not to harm. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/66335/">https://habr.com/ru/post/66335/</a></p>
