  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Resource Management: striving for maximum efficiency</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, Habrovchane! <br><br>  It just so happened that I was always interested in all sorts of improvements.  And what could be more interesting than improving yourself?  What if the mind can break one of the rules of cybernetics and get to know itself?  It is human nature to strive for more.  That is why people read ‚Äúsuccess story‚Äù (success stories), drugs for procrastination, and tips like ‚Äúdo as I do and collect a million fans and a billion dollars!‚Äù.  Of course, educated people understand that there are no universal methods, and that the only option is to work.  Some articles of this kind (how to achieve success and other ‚Äúas better‚Äù methodologies) are already so outraged that they began to unite (community <a href="http://xn-----clcksaplxf6byd3cyb.xn--p1ai/">write-code -...</a> ).  Nevertheless, there is some benefit from such articles, tips, stories and methodologies - they make you think exactly.  They are an incentive to decide what and how to do next, they allow you to reflect on your history, your present and your future. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  As you probably know, there is a minimum strategy and a maximum strategy.  The first is aimed at minimizing risks and losses, the second - at maximizing profits.  Either do not risk and trust the flow, or risk, relying on possible profits.  Since the lost profit is much weaker than direct losses, the minimum strategy seems optimal.  But people would not be people without the ability to take risks, experiment, give in to curiosity.  Who does not risk - he does not drink champagne.  In the case of nature - does not evolve to the dominant species on the planet.  However, you need to risk wisely, having previously calculated everything and prepared the reserves and plans both in case of a win and in case of a loss.

      That is why I wrote this note.  I tried to put together all the ‚Äúways to success‚Äù known to me, while reducing them to a minimum.  For the favorite occupation of people suffering from procrastination is to read articles about her treatment.  And these articles are usually written in beautiful syllables, with beautiful pictures and references to authorities ... A miracle, not articles!  Only here the main function is performed weakly.  This is what I tried to fix.  The syllable in this article is far from unpublicistic.  Important things are underlined.  You can, of course, find some useful tips and know-hows (algorithms) in this article, but for the most part this is a compilation.  Its main goal is to convince you to think about your own effectiveness, about how to achieve your goals.  But its meaning really comes down to one thing - <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Lifehack.</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Stop reading this, figure it out in yourself and let's work!  Otherwise, you will read articles about <a href="http://lesswrong.ru/w/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">procrastination</a> , instead of enjoying life! </div></div><br><br>  However, I present to you <div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">annotation</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  Each of us faced a question of time pressure.  Lack of motivation.  Shortage of forces.  Lack of opportunity.  Lack of resources.  Or, in other words, the means, methods or tools to perform any work to achieve any goal.  This note (26 pages) is designed to systematize the very foundation of resource management, systematize the rules of efficiency.  At the same time, do not expect anything fundamental: just combining materials into a single system.  Human Resources, as it is.  I am not a specialist so far in any of the areas that are discussed in this note.  So far, for everything she is dedicated to is my hobby and in one way or another will be reflected in my future profession. <br>  One important clarification: read only if you are aimed at maximum efficiency, if you want to control your own destiny, and not go with the flow. </div></div><br><br>  If interested - here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qlgPilircEORTa7dYjTS25eaS-GFyxFYg5a_gVnStXU/edit%3Fusp%3Dsharing">link</a> .  I do not publish the note here, as CC 3.0 BY implies commercial use, which I would not want.  Therefore, I chose CC 3.0 BY-NC-SA (Of course, this refers to the work, but not to the information contained in it: with it everyone is free to do what he wants).  If it is more convenient for you to print - I recommend doing it directly from the browser: when exporting to pdf / docx / odf, the markup ‚Äúmoves down‚Äù. <br>  Yes, the note is not adapted for the audience exactly Habra, i.e.  Both platitudes and a down-to-earth syllable can occur.  Alas, this is an access fee.  If you have any questions, wishes, etc., please ask at BOS.  Also, the form in google account is open for commenting.  Enjoy your reading. <br><br>  PS The output of this note is dedicated to the victims of the Chernobyl accident that occurred 27 years ago. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/177541/">https://habr.com/ru/post/177541/</a></p>
