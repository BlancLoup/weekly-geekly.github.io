  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Overview of online survey services</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Marketing agencies with their inflated budgets long ago faded into the background, giving way to online survey services.  The benefits of such services are not few.  Firstly, the company's employees are specialists in the industry and understand the needs of their company more deeply than the ‚Äúwide profile‚Äù marketing specialists.  Secondly, having such a tool as an online survey designer at hand, you can quickly launch new polls without tedious approvals and additional costs.  Thirdly, the most time-consuming part of the work - processing the results - is automated.  This does not obviate the need to work out dependencies in the results; however, this task was partially automated by most of the services for online surveys. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The functionality of most services allows you to create complex multi-level polls and differ completely interchangeable functions.  Online survey design settings, adaptability for various devices, etc.  are must have for all more or less serious services. <br><br>  What you should pay attention to when choosing a service for online surveys: <br><br><ul><li>  Is there a trial version? </li><li>  Tariff opportunities for professionals (the cost of the "average" tariff per year) </li><li>  Available survey distribution methods </li><li>  Support </li><li>  Conclusion of an agreement </li><li>  Server location </li></ul><br><h2>  testograf.ru <br></h2><br><ul><li>  On request, trial access to full functionality for 2-3 days. </li><li>  The annual PRO license provides all the functionality of the service (a functional expansion of the next tariff for narrow professional functions is planned, so there will be some limitations on the PRO license).  The number of polls / questions / answers is not limited.  Tariff cost = 24 990 rubles per year. </li><li>  For the distribution of surveys there is email and sms mailing, as well as various possibilities for placing an online survey on your site: embedding, pop-up window, widget, button.  To search for answers from an independent audience, the service has an additional service - a collection of so-called ‚Äúvoluntary respondents‚Äù, i.e.  people who participate in the survey for free. </li><li>  Russian-language support is by email and phone.  In practice, testograf was the only service that could easily be reached.  The email also respond promptly and in the case. </li><li>  The contract, the signing of additional documents (NDA, SLA, etc.), closing documents - anything is possible. </li><li>  The Russian company, the servers are located in the Russian Federation, the law on personal data (FZ-152) is also observed: testograf is registered in Roskomnadzor as the official operator of personal data. </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.google.ru/intl/ru/forms/about/">Google Forms</a> <br></h3><br><ul><li>  The service is completely free and does not limit the number of polls, questions and answers. </li><li>  The functionality is quite wide.  Yes, there are no many professional functions in the constructor, but for a quick simple survey for non-working purposes it is very suitable. </li><li>  You can distribute the survey by embedding it on your website or by self-mailing a link to the survey. </li><li>  Support is not provided. </li><li>  The conclusion of the contract is also not provided. </li><li>  Google, being an American company, has servers in the United States. </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/">Surveymonkey.com</a> <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/"><br></a> </h3><br><ul><li>  To test the service, a free Basic tariff is provided with which you can create a maximum of 10 questions for 1 survey and collect up to 100 answers.  The functionality of the free fare is rather limited. </li><li>  The average professional tariff Advantage will cost 22,788 rubles for the year of use.  This tariff limits some specific functionality. </li><li>  To distribute the polls, we offer the distribution, embedding of the survey on the site, a pop-up invitation to the survey and a pop-up window of the poll itself.  The surveymonkey has a panel of respondents, but it is not suitable for use in the CIS. </li><li>  Email support is promised within an hour, but in fact the answer to the request for support never came.  Repeat request also remained unanswered.  Of course, if you do not consider the answer an automatic letter of receipt of the request. </li><li>  The contract is not provided, there is only an English-language Master Services Agreement. </li><li>  Servers, like the company itself, are located in the United States. </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="https://www.survio.com/">Survio.com</a> <a href="https://www.survio.com/"><br></a> </h3><br><ul><li>  To test the service, you can use the free rate, which allows you to create 5 profiles and collect up to 100 responses to each.  Some highly specialized settings at this rate are not available. </li><li>  Business tariff gives you the opportunity to collect up to 10,000 responses per month for all created questionnaires.  There are some limitations in functionality.  Tariff cost = 25 280 rubles. </li><li>  To distribute the survey, you can use the email newsletter and place the survey on the website by embedding, a pop-up window or a button, there is also a QR code and the ability to share the survey in social networks. </li><li>  Support is provided by email during business hours. </li><li>  The contract is not concluded, an invoice is provided. </li><li>  The survio servers are located in the Czech Republic. </li></ul><br><h3>  <a href="https://simpoll.ru/">Simpoll.ru</a> <a href="https://simpoll.ru/"><br></a> </h3><br><ul><li>  To get acquainted with the designer, a free tariff is offered, where you can create 3 surveys, 10 questions and up to 100 answers for each. </li><li>  The Profi tariff does not allow several employees to work together on surveys, does not allow to customize the design of the survey and change the link to it.  The tariff will cost 5,500 rubles per year, taking into account the promised discount.  Cashless payment is not possible. </li><li>  You can distribute the survey yourself using the link to the survey, embedding the survey or a pop-up window on your site. </li><li>  There are no promises of support, in contacts there are no details, only an email address is indicated. </li><li>  Information about the possibility of concluding a contract on the site simpoll no. </li><li>  Service servers are located in Estonia. </li></ul></div>
