So I decided to probe the soil and make a small plan.  Of course, you can, as in the 90s, start with a tent on the market.  But we still live in the 21st century, so this text will be devoted to the necessary actions to start your business on the Internet. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/91b/58d/f9c/91b58df9cc533c421ecc1591d5d57c44.jpg"><br>  <i>I will make a reservation right away that I do not pretend to complete the consideration of this issue, I will be happy to listen to advice and recommendations in the comments.</i>  <i>We assume that this is an attempt to compile the collected information together for further work with it.</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Site creation </h5><br>  So, there is a task: to organize an online store.  I am not a big expert in business organization, but one thing I know for sure: the Internet is a great space where you can do a lot of things on your own and for free.  :) <br><br>  Free designer online stores - <a href="http://nethouse.ru/">nethouse.ru</a> or <a href="http://www.squarespace.com/">www.squarespace.com</a> - here you are. <br>  Fish place where you can buy dollars for $ 50 to buy a logo and enjoy life <a href="http://mnogologo.ru/designs">mnogologo.ru/designs</a> . <br>  A free website analyzer that will help clean up bugs and other garbage from the site is here (http://seopult.ru/).  Here you have three free tools that have replaced expensive design and development, as well as some minimal basic level of SEO, which is necessary so that the site does not throw surprises further along the course of the play. <br><br><h5>  Content </h5><br>  To be honest, I would be tense and on my own made a description of each product in my store.  It is not necessary to write ‚ÄúWar and Peace‚Äù, literally enough for 300-500 characters on each product page.  But this is something that must be done.

      It is worth remembering a simple rule: one page is one key request for which you will be found in the search.  This does not mean that it is necessary to fill your site with text with keywords such as "heat, end of the world, the war of worlds Z".  But do not forget to write the name of the product 1-2 times in the text exactly as it will be searched for in Yandex.  And in order to find out what and how they are looking for in Yandex, <a href="http://wordstat.yandex.ru/">WordStat</a> will help you.  Very simple tool. <br><br>  If you do not want to strain and write yourself - the regional copywriters will help you.  You can order unique content for yourself at an average price of 70-100 rubles.  per 1000 characters.  Count yourself - let's say you have 50 pages of 500 characters each - that's 25,000 characters.  100 rubles each  per 1000 characters is 2 500 rubles.  Less than $ 100 money, and the effect is significant. <br><br>  For an online store, it seems to me that such trifles are crucial as: <br>  ‚Ä¢ the correct application form, the button "Buy" // "Put in the basket"; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Possibly, discount calculator (if provided); <br>  ‚Ä¢ page of thanks / feedback after the user ordered something, etc. <br>  ‚Ä¢ on the product page, you can fasten the possibility of commenting using social.  nets <br><br><h5>  Soc.  network </h5><br>  When the site is cleared of rubbish and filled with normal content on every page, it's time to socialize.  It is worth having pages in the main social networks - Vkontakte, Facebook, Twitter, maybe - Odnoklassniki.  The choice of social networks depends on the direction of the business.  If you are an advanced Internet user, you can also access additional social networks.  Instargram, PInterest, PinMi. <br><br>  The main thing here is not to overdo it.  On the pages I‚Äôm going to have, I‚Äôll have to post something on a regular basis, communicate in comments, attract people.  It takes time, so do not overdo it with the number of social pages. <br><br>  I would, for example, have gotten myself a Facebook and Instagram.  Facebook because, for my taste, there is a more solvent public.  And Instragram is not so hackneyed by advertising and commercial groups / pages. <br><br>  It's great if some social buttons are placed on some pages of the site.  networks "Share", "Like" and so on. Free plug-ins of these buttons abound.  For example, I like how they are made in Yandex. <br><br>  Especially cool if in the search results your site will look like this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/ed9/8bd/506/ed98bd50607d4e70fb5cdc2c879fe1d6.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Links </h5><br>  About external links.  We must remember once and for all: the young online store does not need a lot of reference mass.  Some minimal - yes, of course, necessary.  But rushing into glanders is definitely not worth at least the first six months - a year.  And when more reference mass is needed and you start exactly to promote the project, then it is better to master article promotion.  You can, of course, and the reference - so it will be 2-3 times cheaper.  But links are unsafe. <br><br>  Major article exchanges such as <a href="http://www.miralinks.ru/">Miralinks</a> or <a href="http://www.gogetlinks.net/">GoGetLinks</a> work well, they have already recommended themselves, they have a huge base of sites for posting articles.  The main thing when working here is to carefully choose sites for posting articles.  The exchanges have been operating for 5 years already, and during this time there has been accumulated a lot of slag, as well as sites that are spinning in link brokers, which means a hidden threat. <br><br>  You can use other services.  They, however, quite a bit, but there is.  The most recent tool in article marketing is the <a href="http://webartex.ru/">Webartex</a> exchange.  It works for about 4 months and is still in beta, but it has a number of advantages for young Internet projects and for not very experienced Internet businessmen. <br>  First, articles here are placed on proven resources, so such articles are quickly indexed and begin to work. <br>  Secondly, WebArtex itself withdraws positions on requests, which is very convenient and has not yet been implemented in any other exchange. <br>  And thirdly, the work with this exchange is automated as much as possible, and this is a great blessing when you are not a pro and not an ac, or when you work in the same stream with several projects.  Well, actually, that is why the system is called the ‚Äúnew generation exchange‚Äù.  In such systems, you can not be afraid to overreact and be pessimized. <br><br>  Pro Webartex came out with such a case: the Kudagou service for 4 months of work raised its TIC from 250 to 1,300. In general, this is very, very cool for a young project (and Kudagou is a young project).  The only thing - for such results, of course, will have to invest.  Well, probably thousands of 20-30 per month - according to my estimates. <br><br>  More about target traffic from search.  As I understood from the latest articles about Yandex Islands, Dublin, and so on. The innovations of search engines are the secret to getting targeted traffic, not how cleverly you can promote a site, but how well you organize everything inside this site.  That is why carefully check absolutely everything before rolling out.  Pay special attention to how the site looks in the search results. <br><br>  If it looks like this: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/121/e98/463/121e98463e7440c3af58f96f3eec2a28.png"><br><br>  or so: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b4d/d9d/598/b4dd9d598cd1e4363a18a1f219da75af.png"><br><br>  Then don't exactly wait for targeted traffic.  :) <br><br><h5>  Summary </h5><br>  Get organized in the headings, descriptions, select the normal favicon, try to make an extended description, quick buttons, try to insert the social button directly into the snippet.  In the issue you can see nothing at all - up to 6-7 site elements.  This is not much and it should be done as it should. <br><br>  And one more thing that I would definitely do if I started my online store and decided to sort it all out myself is AB testing.  Here is a simple, free, Russian-language service <a href="http://abtest.ru/">abtest.ru</a> .  If you don‚Äôt be lazy, you can experiment almost every day (change the location of buttons, items, baskets, new products, etc.) to finally understand which version of the site gives the best conversion. <br><br>  It seems to me that it‚Äôs very cool that now you can start your own business on the Internet for free and without much effort, and if you look into the matter more deeply, the result will be only better. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185358/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185358/</a></p>
