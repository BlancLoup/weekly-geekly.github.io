But most SEO specialists do not pay him enough attention.  Prepared for you a mandatory list of what should be on the item card and detailed information on its optimization. </p><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ez/m7/9c/ezm79cab6doyypbsyyxe5fu91p0.jpeg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  We at AlkoDesign stand for proper and high-quality SEO.  Earlier we wrote about how to correctly <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/447552/">optimize the sections of categories in the online store</a> .  Category sections are not all that an online store consists of.  Its important part is the product.  In this article we collected everything that should be on the product card of an online store, prepared a cheat sheet and a list of life hacks that will make your life easier. <br><br><h3>  Product Name </h3><br>  Of course, where without the name of the goods.  Still, visitors are not Vanga and they should know what they will buy. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"

      <br>
      Specify the name in the H1 tag (level 1 header).  We do not use the words ‚Äúbuy‚Äù, ‚Äúprice‚Äù, ‚Äúquality‚Äù, ‚Äúfast‚Äù, etc. Just write the name of the product.  And that's all. <br><br><h3>  Photo </h3><br>  Without this in any way.  The visitor should not only know what he is buying, but also how it looks.  Agree, few are ready to buy a ‚Äúcat in a bag‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Important rules for posting photos:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Good quality; </li><li>  Lack of watermarks; </li></ol><br>  In some subjects it is appropriate to place several photos from different angles (for example, jewelry or clothing). <br><br>  Do not forget to add alternative text to the images so that the pictures are ranked in search engines. <br><br><h3>  Short description </h3><br>  This is the same text that the user sees immediately after entering the card. <br>  Also, a brief description is often displayed in categories as a description of the product. <br>  You can add ‚Äúin stock‚Äù (text).  Search will index it and bring you extra traffic. <br><br><h3>  Price </h3><br>  Be sure to include prices!  And in local currency. <br><br>  If there is no exact cost (for example, this requires a calculation), then write the minimum cost: from N rubles. <br><br><h3>  ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù button </h3><br>  You understand that you cannot do without this button. <br><br><h3>  Detailed description </h3><br>  This text is written with the title of the second level. <br><br>  An important nuance is uniqueness. <br><br>  What to do with it, if the text, for example, technical?  Nothing.  We do not recommend to reinvent the wheel and grind out what is not. <br><br>  About clothes and household appliances you can make a unique text of +100 characters.  On the screws - is unlikely.  Therefore, we rely on the subject and act on the situation. <br><br>  And if a lot of goods? <br><br>  There is a small trick: insert the name of the product in the text.  Even if the text from the supplier is repeated on all sites (yes, it happens), then the product name will be unique within the site. <br><br>  + Increase the uniqueness of the card, you can use reviews.  Real reviews.  But more on that later. <br><br><h3>  Specifications </h3><br>  As well as a detailed description, we write them with a second-level heading. <br><br>  Again, do not invent a bicycle.  We write in the most understandable and user-friendly form and form. <br><br>  By experience, the most convenient is the table. <br><br><h3>  Perelinkovka </h3><br>  That ‚Äúwith this goods still buy‚Äù.  By the way, you mentioned it in the comments to the previous article. <br><br>  <b>So the rules are:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  Links are placed in the content part; </li><li>  Links must be helpful. <br>  Not just a block with goods from the same category, but really suitable. </li></ol><br><h3>  Documentation </h3><br>  How is documentation related to search engine promotion?  The answer is simple: search engines rank above those sites that have answers to a large number of possible user questions. <br><br>  That is, if you have a technical online store and the user usually asks for a detailed description, characteristics and instructions - make his life easier!  Post this information on the site.  It is desirable in the file and with the ability to download it. <br><br><h3>  Reviews </h3><br>  Feedback is a magical thing. <br><br>  Firstly, they show that the store is used.  The user increases the credibility of the product and the site as a whole. <br><br>  Secondly, reviews (if they are real) are a unique text.  And it enhances the uniqueness of the product card as a whole and has a positive effect on its ranking. <br><br>  <b>Tips:</b> <br><br><ul><li>  remove the captcha to write reviews. </li><li>  set up adding feedback through authorization in the social.  networks </li><li>  make a rating by reviews. </li><li>  Break reviews on cons, pros and comments. </li></ul><br>  This will help users quickly leave a comment and get the full amount of information about the product. <br><br><h2>  Lifehacks </h2><br>  Without life hacking on the Internet in any way.  We also divided them into categories.  Some of them may be familiar to you.  But repetition is the mother of learning! <br><br><h3>  Products that are out of stock </h3><br>  Rule number 1: if the product is not available, then it can not be bought. <br><br>  Rename the ‚ÄúBuy‚Äù button to ‚ÄúOut of stock‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Further:</b> <br><ul><li>  remove the product from the internal search; </li><li>  move it down a category; </li><li>  add a display of alternative products. </li></ul><br>  If there is no product and it is unlikely to appear, do not rush to delete the page! <br>  Carefully read the statistics.  If users are actively logging onto the item card, leave similar items on the page (but do not delete the page). <br>  If the traffic is not going or it has dropped significantly, put a redirect to a similar product or product category. <br><br><h3>  Micromarking of goods </h3><br>  We recommend using the type of micromarking Product. <br>  Remember to include microdata: <br><br><ul><li>  Ratings / reviews; </li><li>  Price; </li><li>  Manufacturer; </li><li>  Currency; </li><li>  Picture. </li></ul><br>  Google's Structured Data Testing Tool will help you verify whether you have designed the markup correctly. <br><br>  Example: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/v9/5q/me/v95qmefcvrvpuag4tehqgk6-wcm.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Example of micromarking: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fu/pa/pw/fupapwr7db1nejrtpwq3grkhmbm.jpeg" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Reviews </h3><br>  Again: reviews - a magical thing. <br><br>  Users love popular products and they want to know what those who have already bought it think about the product. <br><br>  This increases the confidence and uniqueness of the page, increases the loyalty of visitors to the site.  Additionally helps the user to decide: to buy a product or not. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xj/0j/xh/xj0jxhqqyf_m4cxqckz82axkxvu.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Recommendations for getting real feedback </h4><br><ul><li>  Post ALL reviews (even negative ones); </li><li>  respond to reviews: write ‚Äúthank you‚Äù, collect feedback, promise to sort out situations, etc. </li><li>  motivate users to leave feedback: use contests, promotions, etc. </li></ul><br>  As mentioned above, make the process of adding comments as simple as possible. <br><br><h4>  If there are no comments </h4><br><ul><li>  Parse reviews from Yandex.Market; </li><li>  Give the task to the copywriter to rewrite reviews; </li><li>  Write reviews yourself!  And do not forget about the specific characteristics. </li></ul><br>  And here is the cheat sheet: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qf/nd/j2/qfndj2d0eho6wjn_8pqnqzrlf0m.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/450152/">https://habr.com/ru/post/450152/</a></p>
