  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Closed community of freelancers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In this post I would like to consider three problems that from time to time can be found in the work of a freelancer: <br>  - lack of interesting orders and pleasant work of clients; <br>  - loss of money when you can not do the work is not your specialization; <br>  - the loss of money when you can not take another order, but not to whom. <br><br>  I will try to describe these problems and suggest their solution.  So let's go. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I think all freelancers want to work only with interesting orders and pleasant customers.  But for most excellent customers, as gifts for the New Year, are rare.  Therefore, the choice does not have to, because money is needed by everyone and always. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Most likely, you are familiar with the idea: "If I refuse all uninteresting projects and heavy customers, then I can not earn so much money a month."  It is for this reason that we work very often: <br><ul><li>  over routine projects; </li><li>  above orders, where the customer does not need the best solution, but only the speed of implementation; </li><li>  with someone else's ‚Äúsource code‚Äù, with which it is impossible to work without a mat and it is easier to spit and redo everything anew. </li></ul><br>  Many will agree that it is better not to work with such orders at all.  I also hold this opinion.  But how to maintain a constant standard of living is already a question. <br><br><h4>  Ask yourself questions.  What if you are looking for orders not only?  How much would your efficiency and project quality grow from it? </h4><br>  Let us now consider another situation.  A client appeals to you, and he needs a complex of services.  Let's say a turnkey website.  And you do, only the design of sites and can not take over the project completely.  Most likely, such an order will not receive. <br><br>  Or take another example.  You have already done, for example, the design of the site for the client, but he still needs to make a logo (layout, corporate identity, etc.), but you do not understand this.  Those.  A potential order that is very easy to get (the client already trusts you) floats past you. <br><br><h4>  What if you personally knew specialists in other areas who could confidently transfer this project for a percentage of the budget? </h4><br>  Consider the last example.  I think many people have had crazy cramps when you are already doing two, three or four projects at the same time, and you are being asked for a few more clients.  And you would be happy to take them, but you can no longer physically perform them, even if you work 24 hours a day for several months. <br><br>  Customers go to others, and you regret to understand that you have lost the potential profit, for example, by $ 1,000 - $ 5,000.  I think there are few who like to lose that kind of money. <br><br><h4>  What to do in these cases? </h4><br>  I decided to do something like a freelance association that would help its members deal with these problems. <br><br>  <b>What are the advantages of participation in such a community:</b> <br><ol><li>  In addition to you on the search for orders will work and other members of the community. </li><li>  You will be able to receive clients from other participants who, for whatever reason, are not able to do this project. </li><li>  You will be able to transfer orders that you yourself can not do to other members of the community and receive interest from the amount of the budget. </li><li>  You will be able to carry out projects that require not one specialist, but a whole team. </li><li>  In part, this will help to resolve the issue with the search for interesting projects and pleasant customers. </li></ol><br><br>  If you are interested in participating in such an association, please write me a mail at community@webster.co.ua <br><br>  If you have any thoughts or questions on the topic, ask them in the comments.  Hope we can help each other together. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/123540/">https://habr.com/ru/post/123540/</a></p>
