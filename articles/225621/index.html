I decided to make a small list, all of a sudden it will be useful to anyone. Plus about saving disk space and useful programs will tell. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/978/1b1/521/9781b1521e3c12b99e43f2c2397f2b1a.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="640" height="480"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Periphery </h5><br>  Under the pictures, links to places of purchase (ebay, dx) or descriptions on the Yandex.market, if it is easier to buy in Russia.  Most, of course, belong to the class ‚Äúmake a netbook out of the tablet,‚Äù but the fact is that I don‚Äôt need to connect everything at once.  Sometimes it‚Äôs enough just a card reader, sometimes just network cards, etc.  And the netbook has it all hooked up always and sometimes interferes. <br><br>  The most important thing is a specially trained cord with a charge / data switch.  Allows you to charge the tablet from any charger, not just from the mother.  Even from the USB port of the computer.  Although it is better not to mock the device and provide him with at least 1A.

The cover is quite decent, in contrast to the numerous inexpensive universal dimensions of the tablet does not increase much.  Took on ebay.  The clasp is magnetic, when you open the cover, the tablet does not turn on - not an ipad. <br><br> <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/High-Quality-PU-Leather-Case-Flip-Protective-Cover-for-Dell-venue-8-Pro-/121330142449"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/cb6/569/b4b/cb6569b4bcbdb8faaaab7eb981247f9b.jpg" alt="1046377768_706" width="300" height="225"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f55/ba4/6eb/f55ba46eb534b77fb2e48e6d628f4a8d.jpg" alt="1046381659_359" width="300" height="214"></a> <br><br>  Keyboard.  It is necessary, since the tablet was taken as a replacement for the laptop on short trips.  After buying the tablet, I took the first one I got in the nearest store - oclick 840s - I didn't like it.  Small buttons, curve layout.  Impossible to print.  After long readings of the Internet I stopped at Microsoft Wedge Mobile.  Full-sized keys, normal layout, complete keyboard case, working as a stand for the tablet.  Powered by AAA-batteries, automatically turns on when you remove the cover and turns off when you put it on.  Heavy, of course, but the advantages outweigh this disadvantage. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/76e/50b/466/76e50b4661db93a0d4d642a08084c6e2.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="300" height="227"></a> <br><br>  Mouse.  All the same old Bluetooth logitec (v470), which is used since the purchase of the first 10 "netbook in 2008. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ba3/03e/69b/ba303e69b61cb2df400f236fbca7accd.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="300" height="188"></a> <br><br>  Three-port USB hub combined with a card reader.  Stuck directly into the microUSB, you can not use the adapter.  Conveniently. <br><br> <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/5-in-1-OTG-Multi-Function-Combo-USB-2-0-HUB-for-Smart-Phone-Pad-with-Card-Reader-/350943292764"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/08b/3d3/b93/08b3d3b93d02fe8b9f61dfbab784c3a3.jpg" alt="$ _57" width="300" height="300"></a> <br><br>  USB network card  Some kind of nameless Chinese, I didn‚Äôt remember when on dx.com.  I prefer it to stick through the microUSB-USB adapter, because I usually need it somewhere ‚Äúin the field‚Äù, where the hanging hub will be inconvenient.  I do not give the link, because the network card is completely nameless.  It is recognized as something like AT1001. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d22/9ec/5bf/d229ec5bfd0521bfe46ab464a3107057.jpg" alt="OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERA" width="300" height="237"><br><br>  64GB SanDisk ‚ÄúSDSDQUI-064G-U46‚Äù microSDXC UHS-I Class10 memory card.  I thought of using it to install programs, but looking at the speed of the tests, I decided that it was better not to.  Built-in SSD, albeit slow, but still at times faster than a memory card.  Because the memory card - only data storage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1b5/aac/7b4/1b5aac7b4fed3f2d33fb928a10b20b78.jpg" alt="internal drive speed test" width="347" height="316"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fde/804/bd5/fde804bd514b80374e038e48b9d65602.jpg" alt="memory card speed test" width="347" height="316"><br><br><h5>  Disk space </h5><br>  Initially, it was free 11 gigabytes, which quickly turned into 2-3.  Therefore, at the first opportunity I installed a clean Windows (by deleting the recovery partition) and cleaned it a little (but without fanaticism): <br><ol><li>  Reduced the minimum size of the paging file to 300 megabytes (maximum set to 2 gigabytes). </li><li>  Reduced the size of the hibernation file to half the size of the RAM: <br><blockquote>  powercfg / h size 50 </blockquote><br></li><li>  Removed the pre-installed tile programs.  The first command removes the installed ones, the second one disables their re-installation when creating a new user.  The app store has remained, so what you need can be reinstalled. <br><blockquote>  Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers |  Remove-AppxPackage <br>  Get-AppXProvisionedPackage -online |  Remove-AppxProvisionedPackage ‚Äìonline </blockquote><br></li></ol><br>  As a result, on a clean system turned out 20 gigabytes of free space.  Additionally, you can use NTFS compression, since the processor‚Äôs point of view is now practically free of charge.  But all this is already being done in the process of use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2dc/a14/fa6/2dca14fa68ddbbcc8191f814e4e79da8.jpg" alt="free place" width="350" height="400"><br><br>  Of course, one could poshamanit with wimboot, good people have already <a href="http://forum.tabletpcreview.com/dell/62358-wimboot-dell-venue-8-pro-guide.html">written instructions</a> . <br>  Pros wimboot'a - do not have to give up the recovery partition, gigabytes of free space in excess of my results. <br>  Cons - something else shamanism, even considering the available instructions.  Not for the lazy, in general. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e92/83b/fd5/e9283bfd5715c2f49a241e313e126252.png" alt="wimboot" width="625" height="390"></a> <br><br>  After that, I transferred user folders to the memory card - Document, Images, Downloads, Dropbox, Onedrive, etc. <br>  The desktop was left on the SSD, as well as the application folders (appdata) - for there are stored working files, access to which should be as fast as possible. <br><br><h5>  Useful programs </h5><br>  The most useful is <a href="http://www.lovesummertrue.com/touchmousepointer/en-us/">TouchMousePointer</a> .  Virtual touchpad.  It greatly facilitates the work with desktop software.  Plus also free.  Be sure to install. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/206/ae9/22a/206ae922a7c756277edbc79fe5f6f32f.png" alt="twofinger1s" width="300" height="186"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f5a/86c/b75/f5a86cb75f3c929a433e9627a25b8444.jpg" alt="twofinger3s" width="300" height="170"></a> <br><br>  As a graphics viewer (the tablet was also taken under the initial sorting of captured raw) - stopped at <a href="http://www.irfanview.com/">IrfanView</a> .  Lightroom is too bulky for a small screen, but FastPictureViewer did not meet expectations (especially in terms of support).  I am not at all a special fan of this program - I don‚Äôt like the interface.  In the same Faststone Viewer it is more convenient, and with the touch screen it works better (he knows about turning gestures).  But irfanview has almost no competitors in terms of speed. <br>  Although you shouldn't overlook the built-in windows viewer - it has no problems and quite quickly shows thumbnails of the Olympus raws.  So the initial removal of bad frames in it goes, and in irfanview batch processing and minor editing for those cases when something needs to be published / sent.  Well, the skin on the buttons is bigger. <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48b/9dd/3dc/48b9dd3dcd3bf7c29a6f642c904078f4.png" alt="screenshot" width="625" height="390"></a> <br><br>  As the main browser - tiled IE.  I tried firefox, but it slowed down in tile mode.  Therefore, although it is installed, it is used in desktop mode only for <del>  porn sites </del>  pages full of ads - for IE there is no working adblock, flashblock and other useful plugins. <br><br>  The rest is about the same as on the desktop.  MS Office 2013, Potplayer - it has customizable touchscreen support, aTrip and Geosetter to work with a GPS logger, a Steam client.  Well, other programs as needed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225621/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225621/</a></p>
