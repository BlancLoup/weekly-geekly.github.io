He also noted that the company has no plans for the development of the line, despite the fact that Google owns a significant share of the laptop market in the US and the UK. <br><br>  The versions that have entered the market are already completely sold out, and the company has no plans to release it yet.  Initially, Google did not count on mass demand due to the relatively high price of the product (1300-1500 US dollars), although it showed some success.  So, the first Chromebook was one of the first devices with a touchscreen and the first device that demonstrated the ability of Google to create a system of vertically integrated devices that could compete with similar ones from Apple. <a name="habracut"></a>

      However, the corporation does not leave plans for the development of the operating system <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrome_OS">Chrome OS</a> , running the Pixel notebooks.  Also, it does not refuse to manufacture branded laptops, whether Pixel or not, finally.  All that‚Äôs known is that the Chromebook line will not be updated or re-released. <br><br>  Chrome OS is an open source Linux-based operating system that uses the Chrome browser as its main user interface.  A distinctive feature is the storage of data in the cloud without using physical drives for loading.  In addition to the main Google Chrome Apps, it also supports some Android apps.  For the first time, Google announced a project in July 2009, and in 2011 the first Chromebooks appeared from this OS from Samsung and Acer. <br><br>  The Chromebook Pixel was the first Google product under this brand to demonstrate the potential of Chrome OS.  The 2013 model received a dual-core Intel Core i5 processor with a clock speed of 1.8 GHz, an Intel HD Graphics 4000 video accelerator, 4GB of RAM and 32GB solid-state storage.  The main feature of the first Pixel notebook was an aluminum case and a touchscreen display with a resolution of 2560x1770 pixels. <br><br>  A more advanced version with LTE support appeared on the market several months after the release of the first Pixel.  In addition to integrating with 4G networks and operator support Verizon, the new model included an expanded storage capacity of 64GB.  In the year of release, Google sold about 2 million Chromebooks. <br><br>  Two years later, the company released Pixel 2, which was one of the first consumer products with multiple Type-C USB ports.  The youngest device is based on a 2.2-GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor, with 8GB RAM and 32GB SSD storage.  At the same time, the flagship version ‚Äúfor developers‚Äù of Ludicrous Speed ‚Äã‚Äãwith 16GB RAM, Intel Core i7 with two 2.4GHz cores and 64GB SSD came out.  As in the first laptops, the latest Chromebooks have a high-resolution touch screen, a glass track-pad and a wide-angle webcam. <br><br>  In addition to the Pixel flagship laptops, Chromebooks from companies such as Acer, Toshiba and Samsung were on the market.  These more affordable versions were priced at about $ 500 and could not boast of serious hardware stuffing.  Currently, smartphones are manufactured under the Pixel brand, and it is likely that the manufacturer will not stop there. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/402039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/402039/</a></p>
