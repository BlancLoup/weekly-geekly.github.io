As it turned out - the project is new, at first glance, nothing special, but in general it is quite self.  I contacted the creator, asked him to write about his project, about its creation from the 1st person specifically for Habra - publish (in the ‚Äústartups‚Äù did not work - they ate karma): <br><br> <a href="http://yapiligrim.ru/"><img src="http://yapiligrim.ru/i/logo.gif"></a> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      I never liked to stay at home and from school times I often traveled to other cities with friends and with a camera.  About two years ago, the idea to create a site about walks in Moscow appeared.  I like to walk around the city at night, and I also have a friend who knows about every old house in the center of Moscow, knows the stories - it was very interesting. <br><br>  But at that time I had no opportunity to realize the idea.  For many reasons.  Independently create such a site so that it was beautiful, high-quality and convenient, I could not: I do not own design talent, and, in general, had no experience in developing such services, but familiar programmers and designers who could bring the idea to life , at that time was not.  I had to postpone the dream of creating a site. <br><br>  As time went on, the idea developed and was supplemented and went far beyond the community of walking enthusiasts in Moscow.  And so, two months ago, fate gave me a chance, which I took advantage of.  At this point there were some savings, and I realized that it was time to realize my dream and create a service for travelers.  The first thing I did was to work on the concept of the site, came up with the name ‚ÄúI am a pilgrim‚Äù (I chose for a long time, because it was necessary that a domain with that name be free, sound pleasant to the ear and remembered right away) and found a team of great programmers and designers . <br><br>  We worked in dense mode for whole days, and somewhere in the middle of May the service was ready to receive visitors.  I tried to make the service so that people were comfortable and enjoyable to work in it: exchange impressions about their trips, quickly receive feedback on any country, sights, hotel, and everything that is valuable for a tourist;  get advice from more experienced travelers. <br><br>  During the creation of the site, I met and talked with many people who love to travel, and tried to accommodate all their wishes, and also learned a lot of new things for myself.  For example, I have never heard of wine tourism before - it turned out to be very interesting!  And now I try to communicate with each visitor of the service, to find out his opinion, what he liked and what did not, whether there are any difficulties in the work.  For example, it was a revelation to me that, having entered the site, many could not register simply because they did not find the link to the registration (now this has been fixed). <br><br>  Now users of the service can create their own records, read and comment on others;  evaluate both the stories of other travelers and their own (I confess that I borrowed this idea from Habra);  create and communicate in thematic communities;  create photo and video galleries;  write each other private messages. <br><br>  Of course, I will not stop at this, and ‚ÄúI am a pilgrim‚Äù will constantly evolve.  I plan to make it more mobile so that the service is also available from mobile devices (PDAs, smart phones, cell phones), and so that you can not only read the records, but also create new ones - fully communicate.  New features will be added, for example, such as: viewing flight schedules and creating travel itineraries ... <br><br>  In general, a lot of ideas!  I will be grateful to everyone who expresses his ideas and passes judgment on the current state of social services.  network.  In any case, thanks in advance.  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/27130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/27130/</a></p>
