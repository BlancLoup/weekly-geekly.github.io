Moreover, performers still borrow ideas from musicians of different ages, styles and levels of fame. <br><br>  Today, we remember many rock and pop songs that are familiar to us, which somehow work with classical material.

    <h3>  Because the band The Beatles and Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata </h3><br>  Some musical decisions of Beethoven are so widely replicated and recognizable that they are used everywhere (from advertising to background music to the cinema), and they are constantly referred to by other musicians.  One of these references was made by cult performers from a completely different era, the Beatles.  Because of their song, they use the part of ‚Äú <a href="https://youtu.be/4Tr0otuiQuU">Moonlight Sonata</a> ‚Äù. <br><br>  Only lose it backwards. <br><br>  Here is the "version" of The Beatles: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WeH-vLMfYYw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  It is believed that this is John Lennon's idea - once he heard Yoko Ono playing Sonata and asked him to play it the other way around.  Of course, this is not a literal ‚Äúretelling‚Äù of Beethoven, but the melody of The Beatles song is based on the inverted structure of the first part of the Moonlight Sonata. <br><br><h3>  Never Forget by Take That and Tuba Mirum from Verdi‚Äôs Requiem </h3><br>  Perhaps one of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_Forget_(Take_That_song)">most popular</a> songs of the British band Take That - Never Forget.  At the very beginning of the song, you can hear the melody from the ‚Äú <a href="https://youtu.be/FcFrImouGg8">Requiem</a> ‚Äù by Italian composer Giuseppe Verdi. <br><br>  "Take That Version": <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yoO_1FFr56k" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  The Italian composer wrote this part of the Requiem for bass and choir.  In the song Take That, by the way, the choir is also used - the intro is performed by the boys choir from the city of Henlan (Henllan Boys Choir). <br><br><h3>  Exit Music (For a Film) by Radiohead and Prelude ‚Ññ4 by Chopin </h3><br>  Radiohead not only used references to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/feb/23/poles-collide-jonny-greenwood-penderecki">avant-garde composers</a> in their work, but also inspired by classical music.  For example, in several tracks from the album A Moon Shaped Pool there are references to classical composers: for example, in the track Glass Eyes - to the <a href="https://vimeo.com/167565773">Strings in the style of Debussy</a> , the sound of which exists as if separate from the keyboard and voice. <br><br>  In The Numbers - to Stravinsky. <br><br>  Another "classic" work by Radiohead is the well-known composition <a href="https://youtu.be/50rlHVe6g9Q">Exit Music (For a Film)</a> from the OK Computer album.  The melody of Exit Music (For a Film) is based on Chopin's Prelude 4: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HiwPzHJ-Pic" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><h3>  All By Myself Erik Carmen and Rachmaninov's Concert ‚Ññ2 </h3><br>  Borrowing from the classics is not always the ‚Äúcreative understanding‚Äù of the material or direct reference.  Sometimes it is more obvious - as in the case of one of the most widely used ballads in the world - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DiN9CjAfo5n0">All By Myself by the</a> American singer Eric Carmen. <br><br>  The melody of couplets almost completely repeats an excerpt from the second part of Concerto No. 2 in C minor by Sergey Rakhmaninov: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/21z-K5ChWbE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Eric Carmen borrowed another melody from the Russian composer: Never Going To Fall in Love Again is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DRxEQIyKRKlc">based</a> on Symphony No. 2.  This borrowing was so obvious that it did not go unnoticed - Rachmaninov‚Äôs work at the time of the release of the disc was not in the public domain outside the United States.  After negotiations with the singer, the foundation that manages the Rachmaninoff heritage is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_by_Myself">entitled</a> to 12% of royalties from these tracks. <br><br><h3>  The Doors, Albeniz and Albinoni </h3><br>  Several popular tracks by the American rock band The Doors contain borrowings and ‚Äúquotes‚Äù from classical music.  So, one of the tracks from the 1970 Waiting for the Sun album is a full-fledged <a href="https://youtu.be/HRa2jlZf7Gw">Adagio</a> cover in G minor for stringed instruments and organ. <br><br>  The Doors: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DiBFtBX-Y9E" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Adagio is usually attributed to the authorship of Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni, the Venetian violinist and the Baroque composer.  He was allegedly restored by a biographer of the composer Remo Gadzotto, who published his book about Albinoni in 1945, on a small fragment of the records. <br><br>  In the fragment found by Judzotto, the bass line and part of the first violin part in six measures were described.  On this basis, Gadzotto compiled a full-fledged work and in 1958 released it under the name ‚ÄúAdagio in G Minor for Strings and Organ, on Two Figured Bass by Tomaso Albinoni‚Äù.  Fragment of the Albinoni score, from which he allegedly repelled, no one saw. <br><br>  Now many music researchers are <a href="https://www.cbcmusic.ca/posts/18137/albinoni-adagio-g-minor-biggest-fraud">inclined to believe</a> that Adagio came up with Gadzotto from beginning to end.  Nevertheless, Adagio is one of the most popular and popular ‚Äúclassical‚Äù melodies in the world, which is played in dozens of films and turned to by many of the great musicians of our time. <br><br>  This is not the only example of the work of the group with classic material.  For example, the introduction of the track <a href="https://youtu.be/eszNKHrXxgY">Spanish Caravan</a> The Doors refers to the play <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DinBKFMB-yPg">Asturias</a> "Spanish Suite No. 1" by composer Isaac Albeniz. <br><br>  <i>Classical music never ceases to excite a variety of modern artists - from rock musicians to pop singers.</i>  <i>In fact, many of them are engaged in a ‚Äúdialogue of cultures‚Äù with their predecessors - and at the same time acquaint the new generation of music lovers with the classics.</i> <br><br><hr><br>  <i>More interesting about music in our "World Hi-Fi":</i> <i><br><br></i> <ul><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5370.html">‚ÄúFor every taste‚Äù: streaming services for listening to music</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5300.html">5 legendary rock festivals that rocked the USSR</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5424.html">Box set: how true fans listen to music</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5615.html">‚ÄúSound in the Museum‚Äù - contemporary art and creative experiments</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5088.html">How to make a fortune from noise and become a legend</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5604.html">Weekend reading: 5 books about music and musicians</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://www.audiomania.ru/content/art-5569.html">Forgotten Formats: Flexible Records</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374385/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374385/</a></p>
