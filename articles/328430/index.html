  <section class="page js-page"><h1>New tools for organizing effective teamwork</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Resources offering fresh solutions in the field of development are widely represented on the Internet, and you can easily find websites that give practical advice and recommendations to both beginners and more experienced developers.  But it is quite another thing to find materials that are useful for you as a team player, that is, helping to build work directly within the team.  We picked up several new resources for organizing productive teamwork. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/5ee/6ff/3aa/5ee6ff3aa553491ba1f65e1d4015352d.jpeg"></div><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Ryan Heybourn, creator of the <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/scrum-3"><b>Scrum</b></a> platform, says that he borrowed the term Scrum from rugby - this is an element of the game, the phase in which players wrap their arms around each other, lining up in several rows.  According to Ryan, this term reflects the concept of the product he created - a platform for developers where they could launch projects and work together on them.  Thus, Scrum has become a community in which developers can share with each other their experiences, whether it is third-party projects of the "weekend" or updating existing ones.  Starting a new project is easy - just click the button at the top of the page and set a time frame;  follow the development of the project is also very convenient - for this you just need to unsubscribe about the progress on Twitter, marking posts with the hashtag #scrum.  The site provides round-the-clock support for participants, with which you can ask all your questions directly to the creator of the resource. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/300/fcf/605/300fcf6059884889958a85c2c439fd4b.png"></div><br>  The next useful resource for the teamwork of developers is <a href="https://increment.com/%3Fref%3Dproducthunt"><b>Increment</b></a> , an online publication in which various aspects of the development process are examined using real case studies.  According to the creators, this resource was created in order to give readers an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow truly effective teams work and interact.  Each of the issues is devoted to a detailed, polyphonic discussion of a separate topic, in which authoritative figures from the relevant field take part.  The first issue, published this spring, looks promising: the general theme of on-call services, analytics from the editorial board and interviews with experts, opinions from representatives of companies such as Dropbox, Pinterest, Google, GitHub.
