  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The history of the Russian Internet.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> History is something far away, which is studied by contemporaries from books in dusty classrooms of educational institutions.  The more unusual is the history of the formation of ‚Äúour‚Äù segment of the ‚Äúnetwork of all networks‚Äù - it developed before our very eyes.  Who doesn‚Äôt remember first minute cautious first steps into a ‚Äúbig network‚Äù, and then many hours of hanging up on more profitable night tariffs ... During the period from the 90s to the 99th years, not the smallest (in the future) segment of the worldwide Internet has emerged. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The history of the Russian Internet can be safely begun in 1990, when in January, with the funding of the American Association for Progressive Communications from San Francisco, the public organization Glasnet was created.  The name "Glasnet" also came up with the Americans, combining the words Glasnost and Network.  This public organization was designed to provide communication for teachers, human rights activists, environmentalists and other guarantors of an open society.  In 1993, Glasnet became a commercial provider.  Later, on July 1, 1999, it merged with the Sovam Teleport.  And on September 2 of the same year, Sovam Teleport and Telephone Communications of Moscow joined TeleRoss LLC. <br><br>  The landmark events of 1990 did not end there.  In August, the Relcom computer network was founded (the name is derived from RELiable COMmunications - a reliable connection).  Specialists from the cooperative "Demos" (later - "Company" Demos ") took part in the network creation works, most of them were employees of the Kurchatov Institute.  By the end of the year, about 30 organizations were connected to the network, including Russian science centers in Serpukhov, St. Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Dubna.  The network was based exclusively on UUCP e-mail technology, and with the possibility of correspondence in Russian.

      In February 1991, the first communication session between Moscow and Barnaul took place via modem communication at a speed of 9600 baud using the basic TCP / IP protocol.  And on May 1, the number of domestic network traffic exceeded the exchange between us and the west.  The network has really become Russian. <br><br>  In the same year, the use of teleconferencing was mastered, which, through the first mail server, provided for users to subscribe by e-mail.  And the Institute of Commercial Engineering started the project InfoMarket, which set as its task information support of the Russian securities market with the latest Internet technologies. <br><br>  In July 1992, the Relcom network was officially registered in the pan-European EUnet network called EUnet / Relcom and became the largest on the European continent.  And in the middle of the year, Relcom began the pilot implementation of an on-line IP protocol that provides a real-time connection and expands the list of services available for use besides e-mail.  With the active participation of Relcom JSC and the use of the EUnet / Relcom network, a project was launched to create a scientific non-profit network RELARN, the head organization of which is RosNIIROS. <br><br>  In the same year, a new canal to the West through Amsterdam was commissioned, which approximately four times increased the corresponding capacity. <br><br>  Since 1993, the Demos On-Line company has been leading its history. Since the middle of next year, it received its first users, and later became one of the largest providers in Russia. <br>  In 1994, the RU domain was registered, which can be considered the official beginning of the Russian-language Internet.  Within the framework of the state program ‚ÄúUniversities of Russia‚Äù, the creation of a supporting infrastructure begins, connecting university networks in various regions of Russia - the future RUNNet network (Russian Universities Network).  The first phase covered six Russian regions and was implemented in early 1995.  The communication was carried out on the basis of satellite communication systems with two control centers in Moscow and St. Petersburg.  By 1996, the network operated in fifteen regions. <br>  At the initiative of Moscow State University, supported by Relcom, Demos and other major Internet service providers, the first Russian IP traffic exchange hub was created at the Moscow intercity telephone exchange M-9 (M9-IX is one of the largest such hubs in Europe) , which allowed a number of Russian Internet providers to directly exchange network traffic using common equipment to reduce transit traffic. <br>  The first Russian-language bulletin board was opened in 1995 and belonged again to the first Russian-language game ‚ÄúBurime‚Äù.  Teacher's Newspaper has secured the right to be the first to release an electronic version of its publication.  Since May 1995, RosBusinessConsulting has been leading its history, which launched its own server on the Internet and later became one of the most popular and respected. <br><br>  The Comcon project, which provided an opportunity for free placement in the network for various, first of all, Russian-speaking, non-commercial projects, the first of which was an electronic library, was launched in May 1995 and still exists today. <br><br>  In September of the same year, Demos opens the Russia on the Net resource catalog, and Russia-on-line becomes the first mass commercial provider and opens its own information site. <br><br>  November 8, the most popular resource <a href="http://www.anekdot.ru/">www.anekdot.ru by</a> Dmitry Werner was founded.  With the support of the provider Cityline, it was moved to Russia and for a long time held a leading position in the rambler top100 rating.  It was this resource that in February 1998, for the first time in history, headed one of the categories of the world ranking World Top 1000. <br><br>  At the end of 1995, at the initiative of the Federal Agency for Government Communications and Information (FAPSI), work began on the creation and implementation of the project ‚ÄúBusiness Network of Russia‚Äù.  The project envisaged the creation of a network for commercial use, taking into account its specificity, including solving the problem of ensuring the safety of information.  The project participants are FAPSI, Rostelecom, Relcom, Rospak and a number of other organizations. <br><br>  At the same time, the US Council for International Research and Scientific Exchanges (IREX) launched the program "Expand Internet Access", which provided free access to e-mail, the Internet, and training for graduates of programs sponsored by the US government, universities, libraries and non-profit organizations the territory of the CIS. <br><br>  The year 1996 was marked, in addition to the creation of numerous first resources, which marked the beginning of a whole galaxy of similar resources in the future, the beginning of the implementation of the Interdepartmental program "Creating a National Computer Telecommunications Network for Science and Higher Education".  Later it was named RBNet and coordinated the activities of the four leading departments in the field of science and education: the Ministry of Science and Technology, the Ministry of Education, the Russian Academy of Sciences and the Russian Federal Property Fund, and the State Committee for Communications of the Russian Federation. <br><br>  At the same time, in March 1996, the Open Society Institute (Soros Foundation) launched the program ‚ÄúUniversity Internet Centers‚Äù, designed for five years - until 2001.  The program is carried out jointly with the Government of the Russian Federation.  The acquisition of equipment and financial support for University Internet centers in the amount of $ 100 million are carried out by the Soros Foundation.  The Russian government is financing in the amount of $ 30 million satellite or terrestrial channels to connect to Russian and international telecommunications networks with a capacity of 256 kilobits per second. <br><br>  Of the most significant resources created this year, we can note the search engine rambler.ru.  This is a project of the company ‚ÄúStack‚Äù in the future, thanks to outstanding performance on the indexed documents and the server, it would quickly bypass other popular search engines and for some time will be in the lead. <br><br>  The Internet includes radio stations.  Radio 101 is the first to open its information site and, in addition to the UHF band, will begin broadcasting its own on the Internet.  Radio ‚ÄúSilver Rain‚Äù goes even further and the first in Europe starts around-the-clock continuous broadcasting over the Internet in real time. <br><br>  In general, 1996 was extremely rich in events, especially concerning the opening of the most popular resources in the future.  Among them are the chat ‚Äúcrib‚Äù, the first number ‚Äúzhurnal.ru‚Äù, ‚Äúdamn kulichki‚Äù and other equally interesting resources.  Also this year, such players as the Cityline provider entered the Russian market, which, thanks to a massive advertising campaign in 1997, is already known to all Russian-speaking Internet users. <br><br>  In 1997, companies such as Mirabilis released the first version of the ICQ program, which will later become the most popular tool for real-time communication, pushing IRC technology to the side of the story.  In less than a year and a half, the number of Russian ICQ users was estimated at 65-130 thousand. People. <br><br>  On February 4, the Cityline server opened the TrubAddUrl service - an automated system for submitting information about Internet resources (including their URL and description) simultaneously to ten search engines and directories of the Russian Network, as well as to the ‚Äúcult Russian search for AltaVista‚Äù.  In October of the same year, the service was finalized and renamed the ‚ÄúTAU System‚Äù. <br><br>  On March 16 of the same year, the First Russian Internet Forum was held, organized by ROCIT and Open Systems Publishing House.  The main topic of discussion: "Using the Internet in corporate networks".  The forum was attended by about three hundred people, representing almost 200 Russian and Western companies. <br><br>  Rating system Rambler's Top 100 started on March 24, 1997.  It allowed everyone to install a hit counter on the home page of their site and take part in the popularity rating of the Russian Internet sites in various categories. <br><br>  On July 15, Infoart publishing house announced the creation of the first officially registered Russian-language push-channels for personalized delivery of customized information via the Internet. <br><br>  August 13 can be considered the day of the beginning of the fight against banners, since the banner network Reklama.ru came into effect.  On January 10 of the following year, its improved version appeared under the name Reklama.ru 2.0.  Thanks to more advanced technology (RotaBanner), the use of "mirrors" and the ability to control the target audience, Reklama.ru in a short time ousted the advertising network "Sputnik" from the market. <br><br>  September 15 opened a free postal service Pochta.ru.  Due to the imperfection of the software, it was not able to earn properly and was soon closed. <br>  On September 23, one of the most significant events of 1997 took place - the official opening of the Yandex search engine Yandex, allowing you to search the Russian Network with full consideration of the morphology of the Russian language.  A new search engine is rapidly improving: it soon becomes possible to formulate search queries in natural language, rank search results, search for "similar documents", etc. <br>  1997 became the starting point in the development of the Russian Internet, since it was this year that the beginning of the discovery of many popular (and not so) Russian-speaking resources.  For all their description would not be enough and the whole magazine. <br><br>  February 24, 1998 Vladimir Levin was convicted.  Arrested in March 1995 for a computer robbery at Citibank, a Russian hacker was sentenced by a New York court for embezzling $ 3.7 million for three years in prison and a fine of $ 240,015. <br><br>  April 28th.  Radio 101 becomes the first Russian radio station, the number of potential listeners on the Web is practically unlimited (perhaps 60,000 simultaneous connections).  And on May 7, RadioNet starts its work - the first radio program in Russia that is only available on the Internet.  Moderator - Alexey Andreev.  By March 2000, 20 broadcasts were released, including 5 broadcasts from the cycle ‚ÄúVoices of the Russian Internet‚Äù (interviews with well-known network figures). <br><br>  On 28 June, a section entitled ‚ÄúRegulation and Economics of SORM for Documentary Telecommunication Networks‚Äù was opened on the Moscow Libertarium website, which is devoted to a discussion of SORM-2 - ‚Äúthe system of operational-search measures‚Äù, enabling ‚Äúeffective bypass of the requirements of the Federal Security Service officers for the Constitution and current legislation on mandatory a court decision to limit the secrecy of correspondence, telephone conversations, telegraph and other communications with respect to computer networks, in particular, the Internet. ‚ÄùPublication of news, research  s, comments, as well as carrying out various actions against SORM-2, led to the fact that information about the project SORM-2, allows for total surveillance of citizens, has become available to the general public. <br><br>  According to a study conducted in July by the Moscow office of International Data Corporation (IDC), the number of users of the Russian Internet reached 1.2 million (in 1996 there were only 384 thousand). <br><br>  On August 17, the outbreak of the financial crisis provoked an excessive demand for financial and political information.  The leader in its provision has become the RIA RosBusinessConsulting server.  In connection with the sharply increased attendance of the RBC server, on August 17, the agency expanded the Internet channel from 512 Kbps to 1.1 Mbps.  However, this was not enough.  Already on August 26, the channel was expanded to 2.2 Mbit / s, and on September 21, to 3.2 Mbit / s.  (The next surge in RBC attendance occurred in March 1999 due to increased interest in events in Yugoslavia - the channel was expanded again, this time to 5.5 Mbit / s.) On November 5, RosBusinessConsulting was awarded the highest award in the Business -Site'98 ‚Äù- GRAND PRIX.  And on October 1, RBC set a record of attendance on the Russian Internet - the number of visits to the server exceeded 3 million. <br><br>  November 1 opened a free mail service Mail.ru.  Unlike previous attempts to create such a service in the Russian network (Extranet and Pochta.ru), the project was very successful.  Later, 20% of the shares of Port.ru, which created this service, were sold to foreign investors for $ 940 thousand, as a result of which the capitalization of the company, all of whose property ‚Äî several computers and intellectual property, amounted to 4.7 million dollars.  This can be considered the first major transaction on the Russian Internet.  On March 5, 1999, the number of registered Mail.ru users amounted to 100 thousand, on September 27 - 500 thousand, and on February 29, 2000 it reached one million. <br><br>  According to the ROCIT report for 1998, the number of Russian Internet users at the end of the year was about 1.5 million. The qualitative composition of users: more than 85% are men, about 55% have a higher education;  about 80% of Russian-speaking users live in Russia, almost half of them in Moscow.  There are more than 300 Internet service providers in the country;  over 26 thousand information resources were created;  The total amount of information in Russian in the Russian Network is at least 0.5 terabytes. <br><br>  On January 22, 1999, Yandex began a weekly monitoring of the interests of users of the Russian Network, introducing the NINI-index (stands for ‚ÄúNon-Constant Interests of the Internet Population‚Äù) - the rate of change of interests of Internet users.  The index, published on Mondays, reflects the rise and fall in the number of user requests for certain keywords, whose popularity has gone through the most noticeable changes over the last week. <br><br>  March 5 is significant using the Web as a means of misinformation.  Late in the evening, in the ‚ÄúPolit.ru Discussion‚Äù, a message appeared about the suicide of St. Petersburg Governor Vladimir Yakovlev.  A few hours later, the message was repeated by Gazeta.ru and Forum.msk.ru.  It soon became clear that this was misinformation;  followed by a rebuttal.  Nevertheless, the press responded with articles (March 12 in the ‚ÄúNew Izvestia‚Äù and March 19 in the ‚ÄúKomsomolskaya Pravda‚Äù), which expressed the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe Internet as a whole as an environment of anonymous political provocations. <br><br>  May 14 - the opening of RB2, an advertising network created by Artemy Lebedev Studio, with a banner format of 100x100 pixels.  In less than a month, the RB2 network goes to a million banner impressions per day.  Along the way, the development of a ‚Äúbanner cutter‚Äù begins, which later did not become overly popular. <br><br>  On July 21, a scandal erupted over the publication of the novel ‚ÄúBlue Lard‚Äù by Vladimir Sorokin.  Discussion of a particular issue - publication of the novel without the permission of the author - develops into a global discussion on the issue of copyright on the Internet.  The author of the novel and the publisher Ad Marginem, who has the exclusive right to publish the novel, sues Andrei Chernov and demands to ‚Äúoblige the defendant to remove from his site any opportunities to access the text of the novel‚Äú Blue Fat ‚Äù, including links to any addresses in Internet, from which it is possible to download this work " <br><br>  The round-the-clock Internet news service Lenta.ru was opened - a new result of the Effective Policy Foundation's cooperation with the team that created the project Gazeta.ru in December 1998.  The editor-in-chief of the edition is Anton Nosik.  In a short time, Lenta.ru has become the largest information resource on the Russian Internet.   2000  Lenta.ru     ¬´  ‚Äî Orion Capital Advisors¬ª (Internet Holding Company),     - Rambler. <br><br> 24   ¬´¬ª,    ¬´ ¬ª,        (  57%)   GTS,      ¬´¬ª  ¬´¬ª.     ¬´¬ª   ¬´ ¬ª  ¬´¬ª. <br><br> 29    SpyLOG ‚Äî      -.
