  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Bluetooth Watch and Maemo (continued)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  In the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/nokia/111845/">last article</a> I already wrote about my project With a Bluetooth-watch and Maemo.  The article was already written backdating, since the main work took place last winter and spring, and in the fall I only ‚Äútwisted‚Äù the code under PR 1.2 / 1.3 and corrected a little.  At the time, the program realized the maximum of the clock functionality known to me and there was nowhere to move.  So, the capabilities of the Fossil and Sony Ericsson watches were fully implemented, but there was an ambush with Citizen iVirt - in order to investigate the watch protocol for the functions of controlling the phone‚Äôs camera and displaying the S news feeds!  Quick News (as well as understand the difference in displaying SMS and Mail) needed at least a SoftBank phone, as well as a USIM card of the same operator. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I have long wanted to acquire <a href="http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/keitai">keitai</a> , personally <a href="http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/definition/keitai">experience the</a> specifics of the Japanese mentality and a different technological look at the phones, but really did not want to use our capital intermediaries. <br>  Last fall, Softbank, together with Sharp, released a collectible version of the <a href="http://mb.softbank.jp/en/products/sharp/945sh_g.html">945 SH G</a> phone.  As a collector's edition, the Japanese actively began to resell this phone at auctions.  This fact played into the hands of - the price of the product before the new year was kept at a reasonable price (as opposed to the non-collection version), which I took advantage of. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/756/ac1/03f/756ac103fe303b7f3bdde097204c01cb.jpg"><br>  And so, the phone is available.  In a hurry, I wrote an AT commands sniffer that would allow me to dump traffic between the phone and the clock.  But another problem arose - in the absence of a Japanese USIM card, the phone completely did not want to either raise the Wi-Fi connection or launch the camera. <br>  The problem was solved quite interesting.  I remembered that the company in which I work has contracts with many foreign operators and there is a whole division that has partner SIM-ki for testing.  I had to use it. <br>  Research with the phone has been done.  A little more had to pokapat under Maemo. <br><br><h4>  Change one - group IM chat </h4><br>  When exchanging IM messages in a group chat, there can be an explicitly stated topic.  Now it is transmitted to the clock as a message subject.  I will launch the ray you-know-what to your favorite Nokia - the developer package osso-rtcom-eventlogger-plugins-dev has completely lost the statically elated part, that is, it is not in the package.  We pull .so-shku dynamic loading manually. <br><br><h4>  Change the second - ta-dam! </h4><br>  We now support remote camera shutter control! <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_JVub88nn0k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgltr1Lb1oZiaYKSm2UxHCWvRIWbQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Thanks to the developer of the lfocus package for the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa hack with a simulation of pressing the shutter button.  "Fi" to the creators of HALD for rude nailing SetProperty to the root with nails.

    <h4>  Change the third - RSS on the clock screen! </h4><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TbS7SJXmRBg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700043,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgCsch5-8FSppE4wSkVZX8MrnySgg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Management of the update feeds carried out using a standard full-time client RSS (osso-rss-reader).  Nokia's next "fi" - in the days of Diablo, there were corresponding developer packages in public access.  Now everything is closed, and in GIT there are only versions for Diablo.  But this turned out to be enough to open the RSS cache library and use it at runtime. <br><br><h4>  Lastly, another feature </h4><br>  The processing of notifications has been significantly reworked.  Now, in addition to controlling the call, the clock also displays application notifications: what is visible on the screen of the phone with a ‚Äúyellow card‚Äù is displayed by a pop-up alert on the clock.  E-mail or alarm you never miss. <br><br>  If anyone is interested, he is ready to give collected packages or advise on the implementation of certain functions.  I still do not consider it possible to open source codes - the project has demanded quite real capital costs. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/116175/">https://habr.com/ru/post/116175/</a></p>
