Attendance</b> <br>  Attendance was similar to attendance last month.  We received 13,625 unique visitors, 17878 visits, which accounted for a 96% increase in the total mass of visitors.  But if last month the main traffic was related to publications in the media, announcements on the radio and stories on television, then there were almost no publications in the media, so the traffic was more organic.  In absolute terms, in 2 months we received 27,252 unique visitors or 35,881 visits and 120,790 views.  Here is the dynamics of growth in attendance by month: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06e/9ee/cfb/06e9eecfbf784b65a3b509f5f9cc6f65.png">

      <b>2. Registrations</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a1/df1/1cc/5a1df11cc4074aad9c0f825cffa12d83.png"><br>  For 2 months we have grown to 1,698 registered users, among which 460 referrals.  The growth in users for the month was 104%.  In fact, the growth was greater, because we cleaned the base of non-activated users, which gathered about 300 users, but more on that later.  Now all users listed are activated.  The average number of new users per day is 27-28. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9fc/18a/a1b/9fc18aa1bdee4564afbc598507430c01.png"><br><br>  The number of referrals increased by 173%.  This is one of the best organic types of traffic for us, which we will continue to stimulate. <br><br>  <b>3. Shopping</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4fb/8af/801/4fb8af8018f743eea0962610c9e12eda.png"><br><br>  With 128 purchases, we grew to 399, which is an increase of 212%.  42% make repeat purchases. <br><br>  <b>4. Turnover</b> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bdd/3ba/36d/bdd3ba36dea44b95b5654247ba6773e1.png"><br><br>  The turnover for 2 months amounted to 1.12 million rubles, which is equal to an increase of 125% over the last month.  The number of purchases per day increased from 4 to 9. <br><br>  <b>5. Channels of attraction</b> <br>  -Media and journalists <br>  They almost did not exist, because the launch news gradually subsided, and there was no major information about the month. <br><br>  <b>-Blogs</b> <br>  We included additional blogs to existing ones, which provided us with additional traffic and registrations.  By the way, HabraHabr who provided us with the overwhelming number of registrations in the last month, this month, lost the position because of its reform of resource sharing.  Therefore, we had to draw traffic from other places. <br><br>  <b>-Contextual advertising</b> <br>  We have calibrated contextual traffic over the past month and have already spent much less money on it for the same number of registrations. <br><br>  <b>-Social networks</b> <br>  Publications go there regularly and bring their share of registrations.  We are growing in every social network: Facebook grew from 657 to 1537 or by 134%, VK fell from 2674 to 1888, this is due to the fact that many users came to the action that we conducted last month and after the winner was announced the outflow began, leaving only loyal visitors.  However, the new activity is already showing an increase in the audience to 3034 on February 13.  There are also Google+, Twitter and Odnoklassniki, but we‚Äôll show statistics on them next time. <br><br>  <b>-SEO</b> <br>  We also don‚Äôt find any hands to do SEO, but after the last publication we‚Äôve got interesting proposals for work in this direction, so we will work on it in time, considering that this is one of the most interesting channels for our project.  So far, organically, the number of pages in the index becomes larger and the amount of traffic from this channel has doubled. <br><br>  <b>Referral traffic</b> <br>  As written above, this channel has increased by 173%.  This means that more and more people recommend our service to their friends, place our button on their website, blog, forum, attracting their referrals and earning 10% from their cashback. <br><br>  <b>-Email newsletter</b> <br>  The percentage of opening letters is 27%, which seems to be above the industry average. <br><br>  <b>-Video</b> <br>  Here is another video that allows you to get acquainted with our service in cartoon format. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/xA2Rsq_hjQs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhRbESqvlx3s1avz8IKNNJJ2Z0x2Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>-Promotions</b> <br>  Discounts for stores that motivate to buy more.  Spent two promotions: Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãMonday and Valentine's Day.  Shares involve the placement of stores with double and even triple cashback in honor of the holidays.  Special coupons and big discounts.  A very good tool that we will continue to use to attract the audience.  By the way, our analytical article about the impact of cashback services on customer loyalty and on the increase in the average purchase check due to cashback services will be released the other day. <br><br>  <b>-Rouse travel</b> <br>  We are now giving away <a href="http://clovrr.ru/promo/love-month/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_content%3Dlink%26utm_campaign%3Dvtoroy-mesyac%26utm_term%3Dvena">2 tickets to Vienna</a> .  The draw began in the new month, so let's talk about the results next time. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/355/06c/8cd/35506c8cdc0446208afe410b9fb77821.png"><br><br>  <b>6. Analytics</b> <br>  Began to engage in deeper analytics.  We already know how many and where the registrations come from, and now we want to understand from which channel and how much they buy, the lifetime of the client, etc. <br><br>  <b>7. Fails of the month</b> <br>  <b>-Mail.ru counted us as a spammer</b> <br>  In the middle of the month, due to the increase in the number of activation letters, mail.ru suddenly considered us a spam service.  Because of this, several hundred of our new users did not receive an activation letter.  As a result, we simultaneously began to communicate with mail.ru and look for an alternative solution.  A few hours switched to <a href="https://mandrillapp.com/">Mandrill</a> , which allows you to avoid such situations.  As a result, a couple of days later, mail.ru ceased to count us as spam, but we did not return to the previous mailing mode, replacing all other mailing mechanisms with Mandrill. <br><br>  <b>Non-payment of partners</b> <br>  Some partners in connection with the crisis delay payments intended for cashback.  There is no such problem with Western shops, but among Russian ones, which leads to a situation where a federal holding company is delaying, for example, a payment of 7 rubles.  We will communicate directly with partners and resolve these issues.  Or maybe even mention non-paying in one of the following reports. <br><br>  <b>- For 6 days broke registration</b> <br>  At some point in time, we accidentally broke the registration, which was tied to utm tags for leads from contextual advertising.  We noticed this only after 6 days, which upset us greatly, but made us more seriously work on the tests.  We initially used Jenkins on the development server, but now we are adding an additional architecture to more closely monitor the tests.  About the technical side, somehow tell the next time. <br><br>  <b>-Generation of bogus users</b> <br>  Of course, the growing counters in your personal account motivate many to invite their friends, and others to generate fictitious email addresses.  Fortunately, we immediately stop such registrations and use our fingers to touch such a user. <br><br>  <b>- Removed almost 350 users</b> <br>  Due to fictitious users, due to unconfirmed accounts because of mail.ru and because of our cant with activation, we had to delete about 350 non-activated users.  Because of this, we were offended by some users who collected a large number of referrals, but we sent out to all remote users suggestions for re-registration and returned to them those who registered again.  To activate the account now there are 2 days, after which the user is deleted. <br><br>  <b>-Habr opened the Mega Brain project</b> <br>  This is a big file that closed us to one of the largest channels.  Here <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tm/blog/248411/">is</a> described in more detail about what happened.  In short, the channel for disseminating analytical, business and startup information has decreased by about 100 times. <br><br>  <b>8. Victories of the month</b> <br>  <b>- Competitors are starting to follow us</b> <br>  It has been rumored that big players are beginning to closely monitor our development.  This is great because competition contributes to a healthy market and providing greater opportunities for customers.  We are not afraid to compete, because there are an infinite number of options for development, and we are ready to help the market grow by applying all the innovations that we see in Silicon Valley because of our headquarters there.  The Russian market is hundreds of times inferior to the American one and many things are just starting to work here, which have been working there for decades. <br><br>  <b>-Multi referral traffic</b> <br>  Once again, an increase of 173%. <br><br>  <b>-add authorization vk</b> <br>  Only this month his hands reached him. <br><br>  <b>-Promotions</b> <br>  As written above: started, and they work well. <br><br>  <b>-Investors</b> <br>  Investors began to emerge, including the tops of well-known companies, as well as venture capital funds.  We specially created the project without external investments, in the first place, to see how the market would react to it and collect statistics, and secondly, not to give a large share for little money.  Now we will be collecting statistics for some time, counting the conversion, optimizing the current channels of attraction and creating new ones.  There was and still is the thought that it may be possible to develop the project with the money earned, but then it may not be possible to run fast enough and develop a sufficient number of areas that we see.  At this stage, we proved the viability of the business model on the Russian market, because in the US we served as evidence for ebates.com, which last year was sold for $ 1 billion.  Japanese company Rakuten.  So this is exactly the goal where we are moving, creating an international cashback service, and this is where investors can go with us who find it interesting.  Offers can already be sent now info@kubish.ru. <br><br>  Thank you and see you soon! <br><br>  PS Register and be sure to get cashback from your online purchases on <a href="http://kubish.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dlink%26utm_content%3Dfooter%26utm_campaign%3Dvtoroy-mesyac%26utm_term%3Dvtoroy-mesyac">kubish.ru</a> in more than 2000 online stores in the world. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/285930/">https://habr.com/ru/post/285930/</a></p>
