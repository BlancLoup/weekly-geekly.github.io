But in an incomprehensible way, if you look at the details, I wrote off funds for using the mobile Internet while I slept at night ... And if EDGE was enabled through SBSettings until 1 pm, then at 13:00 I turned it off (sent a letter to the configured E mail and deleted), and my phone inexplicably everything shook and shook ... <br><br>  Having quarreled with technical support, I decided to call my girlfriend ... And it turned out that I could not make calls because I had no money ... And I had 6 rubles on my account ... I tried to call again and the same thing again.

    <a name="habracut"></a>  At first I thought it was some kind of glitch and called those.  support again.  There they told me that my mobile Internet session was not closed and the money was reserved for it ... But how?  Like me, talking to those.  support, I sit in parallel in the internet and shake something? <br>  I was immediately assured that all is well.  They say that the session is closed - call ... And I tried to call and ... I could not again. <br>  And at this time, despite the fact that I was talking, the phone was shaking everything ... <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e2/283/93f/8e228393fef63a393e6478a04feef2f6.png" alt="image"></a> <br>  <i>The picture is clickable</i> <br><br>  I started swearing further.  Already on the seventh call, they helped to dispel the problems of the account, correcting it because of discrepancies with the program ... What is it like?  I did not understand how this is possible ... <s>He told me in 1: PPSOS drove something manually?</s> <br><br>  At one o'clock in the morning I couldn‚Äôt call with an account of 2.40 rubles ... The support service said that I had 23 kopecks in the account ... Well, we‚Äôll check the bill: 2.40 rubles.  Strange ... Oh well. <br>  Since I went to work, I went to bed. <br><br>  Waking up in the morning, I tried to call when the bill was 1.95 rubles, and again also ... <br>  In order not to call the support service, I decided to enter the Personal Account on the site and saw a wonderful picture: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/330/9a9/250/3309a92503f1f3a00efafd03cce70285.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It was already funny, starting with the fact that there is simply no account and ending with the fact that I am Veit, and not Vojte. <br>  Having tried to refresh the page several times, I never saw my account ... <br><br>  Lord of Beeline, are you kidding? <br><br>  <b>UDP:</b> By phone, I dictated the passport data to the support service and the last name was changed. <br>  Disconnected completely all types of mobile Internet.  For 5 minutes between the replenishment of 100 rubles and disconnection on the account left 99.45 rubles. <br><br>  <b>UDP 2:</b> Some kopeks added to the account from nowhere =) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/118127/">https://habr.com/ru/post/118127/</a></p>
