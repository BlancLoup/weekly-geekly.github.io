Tips that must be followed are described in the introduction to <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/299113/">‚ÄúA Dozen Tips - How to Teach a Child to Chess.</a>  <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/299113/">And not only".</a>  .  Before reading this article - read the introduction.  And under the cut the initial topics teaching methods of chess rules.  This technique is based on the course of I.G.  Sukhina "Chess - to school" but with some of my author's changes and tips.  I think that other teachers in this course have their own work. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yes, you heard right - it is the rook that is studied first.  I foresee a stream of comments in which there will be many phrases like ‚Äúand our fathers taught us differently.‚Äù  Therefore, I will retreat with some explanations why it is precisely the rook and exactly that. <br><br>  Any process should pursue any goal.  Chess taught me personally in my childhood.  Stupid and aimless move - brings you closer to losing.  What is it for?  And the fact that we have the goal of teaching chess - raising the level of the child.  If you want to make a child prodigy from a child, then you need to study with 3 years, and more often with another program.  If, in order for the child to be interested, to raise his educational level, this is the way it is. <br><br>  I specifically roll back to this question because parents often do not understand what they give chess to the child who is involved in them.  These questions were written in more detail in the <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/299113/">introduction</a> .

      Before studying a rook, a child must understand and understand the meaning of the following words - a cell (it‚Äôs a field), a board, a horizontal, a vertical, a diagonal, and the center of a chess field.  Learn the name of the chess pieces and know their placement on the chessboard.  And yes - do not forget to show how the board is put correctly!  According to the method of I.G.  Sukhina (and in Europe too) - the right angled margin near the player is white. <br><br>  I will not dwell on how to give these concepts - your will.  But remember one thing - the names of the chess pieces in Russia are as follows: pawn, knight, bishop, rook, queen, king.  No "queen", "tour" and "officer".  There are official names - and apply them in communicating with the child and learning.  All the rest is slang conversation.  Do not.  You can say for example why the rook is called that way, and at the same time tell a bunch of stories about it.  The child will be interested - believe me :-) Like you.  I am sending interested in the Internet, I will not dwell on these issues.  Look - it was interesting for me, for example, when I was at the very beginning acquainted with the story - it was even exciting at times. <br><br>  In the future, all the moves of the figures describe through the concepts given above.  This is right and teaches the child to the correct thinking and language.  There is no need to "diagonally" (although sometimes you have to say that with some children, but this is in group classes), only "diagonally". <br><br>  Let's go back to the boat.  Rook is the simplest figure.  For a child, the rook is the easiest to understand.  ‚ÄúThe rook moves along horizontals and verticals‚Äù.  As far as I understand, the order of studying figures starting from the rook was first introduced by the author of the course, IG  Sukhin.  As proof of the fact that this order is optimal, one can cite the fact that this ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù (it‚Äôs true that it‚Äôs 20-30 years old, no less) will be adopted by other chess experts.  For example, the textbook Prudnikova I have mercilessly criticized follows the same principle.  Other general education courses study the shape often in the same manner. <br><br>  The explanation is quite simple - answer the question - do you want to teach a child to gain knowledge or to hammer his knowledge into his head?  If you teach - achieve understanding.  From simple to complex.  If you drive in ... Well then - drive in.  But without my advice. <br><br>  I try to teach children not so much chess as the skills that they can get and apply in later life.  How many of our children are world champions?  And does the child need the load that is supposed to achieve maximum results? <br><br>  The main exercises that are used in the method of I.G.  Sukhin, are quite simple, and give results with their complex and consistent application.  As I wrote in the introduction, the order is verified and verified.  And far from me, I just voiced it in this article. <br><br>  Another couple of moments.  In order for a child not to have cereal in his head, he must strictly follow the rules of practice.  We will study the pieces by making white pieces.  We will also use two types of checkers - black and white.  The fact is that checkers are not chess pieces, and in the process of learning the student does not have any confusion with the pieces.  But it must be clearly explained - checkers are an additional tool, but no more.  Since  we play with white pieces, the black checkers are our enemies, and the white ones are our friends.  But the checkers do not go, but stand still.  And friends do not beat.  It turns out that black checkers are the goal, white checkers are obstacles.  Sometimes I make fun of children, saying that ‚Äúthe white piece is a whitewashed wall, do not hurt your forehead.‚Äù  Or that "it is a birch, it hurts to knock about it."  In general, what fantasy enough for.  But you can't beat white checkers.  And black is necessary. <br><br>  But enough, it's time to work. <br><br>  <b>Exercise number 1.</b>  In IG Sukhina it is called ‚ÄúOne Soldier in the Field‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mf/gb/dg/mfgbdgtgp25yxks6bcboeo4qtsk.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nm/h0/da/nmh0dauevtotnfwyxlwxqewdi0a.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kl/mc/mc/klmcmcerxbj-rcshgfo8v9xp5-w.png"></div><br>  The meaning of the exercise is that the child learns to walk a particular figure.  These tasks in other courses are called, for example, ‚ÄúGather berries‚Äù, or in some other way.  But the meaning is the same - it is necessary to beat all the black pieces on a board with one piece.  In the tasks of IG Sukhin, there are not black pieces, but black pieces, but personally I use black pieces for this purpose, not black pieces.  With each move you MUST take one checker.  Those.  The number of moves made by the rook is equal to the number of checkers. <br><br>  <b>Difficulty number 1.</b>  Arrangement of figures is a special difficulty, which depends on how old a child is.  Children 6 years of age, for example, have some difficulties in the arrangement, children of 10 years - almost none.  But in any case, it is necessary for the child to place the given diagram himself.  And only myself.  The advantage of this approach is that children begin to better feel the board, to see it.  They develop memory, spatial thinking.  Albeit not immediately, but by the end of the passage of all the figures, the speed of the arrangement is very decent. <br><br>  <b>Difficulty number 2.</b>  The fact is that chess is played with one hand.  Those.  the order of taking the figures is as follows - you need to take a piece, remove it from the board, then rearrange the piece to the place where the piece stood.  I try to carry out the first exercise with children of 6-8 years old so that they are caught in the fact that they put the figure in the wrong place.  When they remove a piece from the board (one by one), they almost always turn away.  And then ... put the boat on the wrong field.  This moment it is necessary to catch and pay attention to this child.  I noticed that the children, whom you indicate to a maximum of 2 times that the checker was standing on another cell (without showing the cage), then begin to automatically remember where it stood.  Almost all children after one or two adjustments are no longer mistaken.  This is the first point that I call for myself - a memory switch.  Believe me - you can catch any child of 6-8 years old on this, sometimes a bit older.  But since the 10th memory they already have, and rare children are caught on it. <br><br>  <b>Council number 1.</b>  You yourself can perfectly come up with an arrangement similar to the one given above, but one thing should be taken into account - the way for the right decision should be the only right one.  The same advice applies to all other tasks that will be given further. <br><br>  <b>Council number 2.</b>  Never scream at the child.  Never raise your voice.  If the child has fallen into a stupor - better help him.  If he is tired - postpone exercise.  "One soldier in the field" are almost all, but this task is more attentive.  By the way, the child himself can do similar tasks, for example, he will arrange drafts for you by inventing a position - and then you will pass it.  Those.  task on the contrary, why not? <br><br>  <b>Exercise number 2.</b>  "Shortest way". <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ia/pg/ro/iapgro1bqutpyr-9gau_cwvogaw.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/_v/6e/kv/_v6ekvspafeaqawmfkxk-55zv94.png"></div><br>  Everything is quite simple here - it is necessary to beat the black checker for the MINIMUM number of moves.  Believe me - if everything is simple with the rook at first glance, then you will be surprised that children do not always see the shortest path.  In IGSukhin in the task ‚ÄúThe shortest path‚Äù it is required not to beat the black pawn, but to get to the rocket (or the control field), but personally I use not the rocket, but the capture of the black checkers. <br><br>  <b>Exercise number 3.</b>  "Labyrinth". <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/e_/ah/zc/e_ahzco8_rm4acmy6-ofohl93jc.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fc/3r/mm/fc3rmm-iukh8aroxrqy2luvipcs.png"></div><br>  Well, I think there is no need to comment.  Just a labyrinth, with a view (black check) and walls (white check).  Again, in I.G.  Sukhina in the diagrams are given mines as walls and a rocket as the end point.  But drawing mines and rockets ... I go around with drafts. <br><br>  <b>Council number 1.</b>  To arrange a labyrinth for a long time and it is difficult, so in group classes I sometimes give a weak tongue and help children.  In fact, you need to look at the child - if he begins to find difficulty, help with advice, but not by acting first.  And if only the difficulties begin - then yes, put a number of checkers.  But so that the child himself has put at least a part.  In no case do not put all the checkers themselves - it is more harmful than to stop doing at all.  There is a single exception - if you grow yourself a freeloader in the future.  The child himself will accept the help, even if he puts in only 2-3 checkers, but he will know that you only helped to arrange, did he put them himself? <br><br>  <b>Exercise number 4.</b>  "Outsmart the sentries." <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fv/un/mh/fvunmhtm5nf03lha3t_bcsc3-lo.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cn/ja/nn/cnjann7hvp48m1wp0sjjrqgr2oo.png"></div><br>  The task is unusual for chess players.  The fact is that in this task the enemy figures are already being entered, but they are NOT walking.  It is impossible to jump over the lines at which the figures are shooting - it is possible, to stand on them.  Everything is quite simple.  The task is clearly the development of a maze, but with the addition of enemy figures. <br><br>  The main goal of this assignment is to begin to see the fields that you cannot stand on, since  they are under the battle of enemy figures.  Again, for children 6-8 years old, this can be difficult.  But coached. <br><br>  Another point that chess coaches do not perceive - there is no king on the board.  If we proceed from chess, then yes, there is no king.  But if from education ... Our goal is to teach a child to walk in figures.  It is unnecessary to put extra pieces just to be there and prevent his brain from perceiving the information being fed (and we have this training for the rook moves at the moment). <br><br>  <b>Council number 1.</b>  To make it clearer for children, I recently told them that the enemy's rooks are snipers who shoot at the fields along which the rook walks (and later on other pieces).  Snipers are sitting in wait, all children know this (surprisingly), and the difficulties after I began to explain this exercise in such a way did not arise from the word "never." <br><br>  <b>Council number 2.</b>  It happens that some children do not see these fields.  I invented a little help for them.  I give the black checkers, and I propose to place them on those fields, on which the enemy's rook shoots, but we turn the checkers, as if they were holes, through which we can jump.  The result is a field filled with drafts.  Most of them are turned, one is normal - this is the goal, and there are free fields on which to walk.  Often, after one or two times of this arrangement, children better complete this task.  And yes, after the child has completed the task with these checkers - we remove them, and he passes the task already without them, remembering where he went.  By the way - the second way to start the memory.  At first the children wander, but then they remember how they went.  If anything - you can help, but not doing the whole task yourself. <br><br>  <b>Exercise number 5.</b>  "Capture the control field." <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/l_/y2/_9/l_y2_9crw2b9tunokx9mrb2ztsu.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g1/kb/b0/g1kbb04bwndhreptmxnfd3h8k_8.png"></div><br>  It is also quite an interesting task, the first performance is difficult for children.  On the board are two rooks - black and white.  We walk white.  Our goal is to get on the field marked with a cross (I usually turn the checker there, but it's not there, as it were).  Black rook walks and tries to stop you.  If you got on the field with a cross, but after that you were killed - you lost.  If not, you win. <br><br>  <b>Council number 1.</b>  It is better to either put the piece upside down or not at all.  But I put.  Here the difficulty is that you can jump over the field, and this particular moment is difficult for the first time. <br><br>  <b>Council number 2.</b>  Go for black yourself - children do not know how to go for the enemy.  They say - and he will go like this (and make a stupid move).  Your task is to teach the child to walk smartly, anticipating the moves of the opponent.  And since  You are a priori stronger than him, and he knows it, then to beat you - for his happiness.  Naturally, the child knows that he is learning, and in no case should he give in!  Never!  You can make the rules so that he could win, but with an effort.  I don't even play on the board with children, giving them a head start, there are other methods.  You can play on the board full of figures, but with the advantage of the child.  And so that he knows - you play at full strength and resist him.  But I will tell about it later. <br><br>  <b>Exercise number 6.</b>  "Restricted mobility." <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ui/sp/oy/uispoyle31l8a3kqgsnvk7hruey.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1m/nd/nw/1mndnwgeuedpq991ujew8p1xq-i.png"></div><br>  Everything is simple - white and black take turns.  White's task is to beat the opponent's piece. <br><br>  <b>Council number 1.</b>  Naturally for black you go.  And walk strongly, as much as possible. <br><br>  <b>Council number 2.</b>  I explain this task to children in this way - ‚ÄúDo not look at your own figure, look at the black one - what will it do next?‚Äù  Here on this field and attack.  This approach lays the foundation for predicting enemy moves.  In the future come in handy. <br><br>  <b>Exercise number 7.</b>  "The game of destruction." <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8b/vh/rt/8bvhrtdnfb1nr4pwva2otq2-4ao.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jm/cj/pd/jmcjpd0lr9u29ahnewhey2c03jy.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ez/if/zs/ezifzs_1yeicj3rcccvy3acz7ig.png"></div><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mi/gb/yt/migbytmhydust6mfzti7murthfa.png"></div><br>  The objective of the task is to determine who will win.  The first move is always white.  Figures take turns. <br><br>  Children first perceive this type of exercise as self-indulgence.  Until more difficult tasks are met.  And it would seem that the board is only 2x2 cells, or 3x3 ... But they can not yet predict the moves of the enemy - they simply do not know how.  In addition, children complete boards - too big, they still do not fully perceive them.  The 2x2, 3x3 board is perceived by them entirely, and the 4x4 board is already complicated. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  I promised to release this article earlier, but family and business matters did not allow me to take it further.  I think my criticism (the article <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/295081/">‚ÄúFear of chess being imposed on you‚Äù</a> ) is more understandable after these explanations.  Difficulties in writing were not only in typing, the fact is that I.G.  Sukhina course fully developed.  And it‚Äôs already far from the first year.  The course is general education, i.e.  focused on the general flow of children with the active participation of the teacher.  I gave my own teaching methods, according to the course, with some explanations.  The fact is that recently ‚Äúpseudo-developers‚Äù of training courses that just take a ready course have become more active, and they don‚Äôt care about copyrights, do not care about tests that are conducted for years (the results achieved by children appear after a year or two mostly).  Testing during the year is about nothing in pedagogy.  Recently, all these "developers of chess training courses" are asked to provide their own developments for implementation in schools, and "we will mention your last name in the co-authors."  Well, yes, probably someone is interested.  But from the point of view of science, comrades, and you yourself do not want to carry out real scientific work?  Or you can not do this? <br><br>  I did not give all the tasks that are in the know.  The fact is that they are available in the textbook ‚ÄúSukhin I.G.  Chess, first year, or There cells are black and white wonders and secrets are full: A textbook for primary school, the first year of study.  In 2 parts.  - Obninsk: Spiritual Revival, 2017 ‚Äù.  For each type there are about 6 tasks.  How tasks are compiled - I wrote the principle: the only one right decision.  Tasks to give in order of complexity. <br><br>  And also for sports trainers.  You teach sports chess, I am general education.  These are different faces of the same subject.  Load, goals, methods, children - they are different in these two cases.  I know that some coaches read this article (the last one was actively discussed in specialized forums).  I call for a simple understanding - general education chess will be given to you by a larger number of basic children prepared, you will not suffer from staging the right moves.  Plus, children will be able to think.  I myself teach and sports chess, I myself was a sportsman during my childhood.  This is hard work, and not all children need it.  But the advantages that chess gives children are obvious.  But the course that they want to introduce into schools and HOW they want to introduce ... after that, chess will not survive.  Yes - they won't die right away, but they will stop trying to engage them in children.  Do you want that? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/411071/">https://habr.com/ru/post/411071/</a></p>
