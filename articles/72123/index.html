      First of all, I wanted to say that this post is essentially a self-replay.  I already wrote about this hard drive a year ago in the <a href="http://www.computerra.ru/reviews/392483/">Computerra</a> pages <br><br>  But first, a year has passed and I managed to drive this screw into the tail and mane (and now I would like to share my impressions), and secondly, I did not find any mention of something like that on the habr.  I hope someone will come in handy. <br><br>  So screw.  Toshiba MK6008GAH worked on my 5th generation iPod Video.  It was 60Gb in size and had tremendous size (even compared to a 2.5 "hard drive). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30b/78f/3b7/30b78f3b7c28e4112121043afb9e6288.jpg" alt="miniaturization in all its glory"><br><br>  However, the reincarnation of the external screw did not even interfere with the dimensions, but the tricky ZIF interface.  Ie the screw itself was an ordinary IDE, but this imprisonment under the train ... <br><br>  Helped, as usual, China.  On ebay, an external box for 1.8 "Hitachi and Toshiba screws would have been bought. It was worth $ 12 happiness including shipping. Included, besides the screw itself (as well as the standard USB cord and the touching screwdriver), were two quotes for screws. <br><br><img src="http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/8862/kitb.jpg" alt="not enough Chinese chopsticks"><br><br>  The Hitachi train was not useful to me, of course, but I famously picked up Toshibovskiy.  True, it was necessary to understand how to cling to the board, but many attempts were not required. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a87/be6/87c/a87be687caf083b0ba6213ec86b7736a.jpg" alt="preassembly condition"><br><br>  The screw into the case entered quite tightly, the train had to be touched a little ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/643/687/9b3/6436879b39c3278bb12365f2173bb29a.jpg" alt="would grease"><br><br>  ... but the plugs screwed up normally and the screw worked from a half kick. <br><br>  As a result, I received a very compact and capacious storage capacity of 60Gb. <br><br><img src="http://img517.imageshack.us/img517/2372/case2v.jpg" alt="working view"><br><br>  Even in the assembled state, my external screw is smaller than the ‚Äúbare‚Äù 2.5 "screw. Which, of course, is good news. The resulting dimensions are only 10x6x1 cm. <br><br>  Now directly about Toshiba / China external hard drive. <br><br>  Case frankly cheap.  The end caps are plastic, the body itself is aluminum.  But he copes with his role with a bang.  Yes, and the complete pseudo-leather cheholchik saves the insides from the picky look.  When working screw heats up a bit, but its temperature to the touch does not cause concern. <br><br>  As it turned out on the forums, the life of the screw itself is low.  About 6000 hours of failure.  On the other hand, as my external carrier, I use it definitely less than when working in the player.  So I'm not worried. <br><br>  Speed ‚Äã‚Äãagain, do not have to wait.  A 1.4 GB file is written in 2 minutes 52 seconds. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d4/3cf/7c0/1d43cf7c09729dc3e8ac328ca65a22c1.jpg" alt="speed"><br><br>  But sizes, sizes ... <br><br>  Now, a year later, I can absolutely say that this screw has never failed me.  Still, Apple's good vendors (by the way, in the old Microsoft Zune and some video cameras with the hard drive, use this or similar hard drives with zif, so if a couple of broken ones were suddenly lying around ...) <br><br>  I carry with me an archive of working documentation, any portable software, a collection of music for prompt uploading to the player (yes, I took the player with flash memory) and other nonsense, which is a good idea to have on hand.  Again, the place takes a little more than a flash drive.  So I am very pleased. <br><br>  Ps By the way, the presence of the ZIF interface has led to the idea that in players based on the hard disk, the latter can be replaced with a tandem from the CF card and CF-Zif adapter.  Firstly, such a replacement will allow you to be less afraid of falls, and secondly, often the large amount of the hard drive in the player is clearly redundant (my weekly playlist rarely exceeds 4Gb, and I somehow cannot watch the video from the postage stamp), so you can win like in money so in speed.  The only interesting thing is whether Itunes will allow you to install a system on such a flash drive? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/72123/">https://habr.com/ru/post/72123/</a></p>
