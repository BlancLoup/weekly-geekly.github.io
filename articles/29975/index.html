Yard cramped, cars are on each other.  And my interlocutor lives there.  And he does not like when someone comes and parks in the yard.  Suppose you can understand it. <br><br>  But this is not his yard.  Not his property.  He does not pay land tax for the yard area.  He has no exclusive right to own and use this territory.  Cars do not impinge on his freedom.  Legally, parking in the yard is not prohibited.  And the desire to burn the car - is criminal!  With his phrase: ‚Äúnot to be bastards, live by yourself and let others live‚Äù - I argued for a long time, I argued a lot.  And then agreed ...

      He is right, he is right in everything!  I looked at myself from the side.  I'm doing the same thing.  The only difference is that I give to others and live by myself.  I never blame anyone for parking in my yard, parking in the green zone, on the sidewalk, etc.  I do not know what circumstances forced a person to park on a children's playground - maybe the driver came to the sick mother!  Maybe the child is lost!  Many reasons! <br><br>  What is my right to a person temporarily, when this penny, in 10 square meters, I do not need to go to the village or to the city, prohibit parking on it? !!!  I allow everyone to use this territory.  This is not my property and I can neither allow nor prohibit its operation.  This is common!  Everyone has a temporary opportunity to use. <br><br>  Therefore, when I allow others to park in my yard, I rely on the same attitude towards myself.  I park in foreign yards!  I give life to others, and because of this, I live quietly, comfortably for the nervous system.  This applies to all my coexistence relationships with other people. <br><br>  There are too many of us on the planet, so that everyone could stake out a place that he needs at any time. <br><br>  After all, breaking this rule can be to the point of absurdity.  What if a neighbor finds out that her neighbor has four computers in a room behind the wall and her neighbor will be very excited?  ‚ÄúRadiation-radiation !!!‚Äù he will scream!  ‚ÄúChernobyl is not enough ???  Want to have four computers - glue the lead wallpaper !!!  Inside the apartment, do what you want, but do not release radiation beyond the limits !!!  Do not be bastards, live yourself and let's live to others !!! ".  For example, I really do not want my companion wound up such a friendly neighbor! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29975/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29975/</a></p>
