By the day of his birth, we established a scholarship in his name at the Faculty of Computer Science at the HSE, which was created this year with our participation.  As we <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/yandex/blog/217981/">have said</a> , the faculty program will grow in many ways from the School of Data Analysis, where <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/iseg/" class="user_link">iseg</a> also worked on what the CS department would study. <br><br>  The scholarship will be available to undergraduate and graduate students of the faculty.  It was created to support and encourage people interested in science and technology.  It will be issued for success in studies and scientific activities.  From the first year, students interested in technologies at the junction with science can conduct their projects and publish results in Russian and international scientific journals, such as Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making, Lecture Notes in Computer Science and others. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6c/f0e/67b/b6cf0e67bfbf4c7c8434aab6c452d633.png"><br>  <i>The first meeting of students of the Faculty of Computer Science</i>

      In the very first year, the Faculty of Computer Science of the Higher School of Economics and Yandex attracted the attention of a record number of Olympiad winners: 330 Olympiad applicants applied for 180 budget places.  As a result, HSE decided to increase the number of budget places, and in September, 204 students of olympiad began their studies - among them fourteen winners of the final stages of the All-Russian School Olympiad in computer science, mathematics and physics.  Ilya himself once took second place at the All-Union Mathematics Olympiad. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Total for the payment of scholarships during the year provided 3 million 420 thousand rubles.  This money will be distributed among ten undergraduate students, three graduate students and three graduate students.  During the year from the date of awarding the scholarships, they will receive, respectively, 10, 20 and 25 thousand rubles each month.  In the future, when the faculty grows, scholarships can also become larger. <br><br>  The first scholars will be determined on the first birthday of the faculty - April 1, 2015.  The decision on the appointment of scholarships will be made by the competition commission of the faculty teachers, among whom are the leading developers of Yandex. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/236579/">https://habr.com/ru/post/236579/</a></p>
