The game of chance.  Poker, horse racing, tote and other games of chance brought many not only pleasure, but also brought to bankruptcy (or to more terrible things).  And, of course, many aspects of such businesses have always been shadowy ... <br><br>  This shadow aspect has not disappeared anywhere from the modern gaming industry.  While there are a small number of ‚Äúethical‚Äù games, the creators of which develop the product according to their ideals, most creators profit from the deceit of the simpletons.  As a rule, they hide behind the fact that, in the conditions of complexity and saturation of the market, as well as the high cost of attracting a client, they have to be aggressive: ‚ÄúNot we are such - life is like that‚Äù.

      Naturally, you will say: "This is business!".  Sometimes, in fact, the way it is, but the "shadow" actions have a much greater impact on the gaming industry than is commonly believed. <br><br>  Take, for example, the sale of virtual goods in children's games.  ‚ÄúFree games‚Äù are very popular in various market segments, but for many creators the possibility of selling ‚Äúrelated‚Äù gaming products in the process looks very seductive.  The principle that allows players to regulate their financial involvement independently (that is, on their own will) seems to be right on one side only, but many do not fully understand what this principle really means.  Parents often overlook the fact that children know their iTunes password.  The secret remains covered with darkness until multi-page bills arrive for their purchases by children of virtual goods for amounts with large zeros. <br><br>  Such a situation arises due to the fact that there are game manufacturers who consider it absolutely normal to offer a 9-year-old child a $ 99 game item.  Because they think they have an excuse.  Because they hide behind the words "choice" and "parental responsibility".  How much can you tolerate these antics? <br><br>  The problem of all "good" game manufacturers is that such incidents leave an imprint on the industry as a whole.  The difference between the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù game for Facebook and the ‚Äúreal‚Äù (constant spam and advertising) just explains why the social games industry is stagnant.  What was a giant breakthrough in the gaming industry has become just one more opportunity for rogues to make easy money!  And following the example of Facebook, we can judge that the root of evil lies in the insufficient moderation of such unscrupulous gaming products. <br><br>  Selling low-grade gamification related solutions is another industry issue.  The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãgamification is developing and acquiring new and interesting forms, but sometimes there are also those that do not work a priori, thanks to the ‚Äústrange‚Äù companies offering something like GIF-animation and tables with points for anything. <br><br>  Perhaps in this regard, as a successful case, you can consider the approach of Apple and its AppStore, whose specialists understand that the user comes to them for high-quality content, and therefore study each incoming application up and down.  It is high-quality content that needs help in order not to get lost among similar applications with large marketing budgets! <br><br>  An ideal game should meet the following criteria: it should be a game, not a hidden online store;  There should be no promotional push or other notifications;  the game should not deceive and offer related installations of various software. <br><br>  The gaming industry is trying to get rid of the stigma of ‚Äúentertainment for teens‚Äù and, moreover, it even tries to get out of the category of simply ‚Äúentertainment‚Äù!  Game authors want to feel like artists who combine with producers of films, music and writers and create a worthwhile product! <br><br>  In the old days, game creators risked facing one unpleasant situation: if they were going to release the game on a ‚Äúnon-PC‚Äù platform, they automatically put their creation at risk, because platform owners could simply reject their offers until they were created game that fits into the concept and development strategy. <br><br>  Nowadays, the situation has changed, and the authors of the games have received much more opportunities, but the requirements for them have become very different!  Unfortunately, no matter what, manufacturers of low-quality and unfair games will always be among us.  There will always be those who want to use different platforms as a ‚Äúdump‚Äù for their ‚Äúwaste‚Äù.  There will always be those who somehow justify them.  And this will continue until the industry itself establishes an adequate measure of censorship and settles the processes within itself independently.  Well, or someone "above" will do it for her. " <br><br>  <i>There are rumors in the industry that there will soon be some censorship of content in games and gaming applications.</i>  <i>What do you think, is it really necessary?</i>  <i>Are there any successful cases with the monetization of free gaming applications "in accordance with morality"?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/178517/">https://habr.com/ru/post/178517/</a></p>
