And every day it is growing steadily.  In addition, more and more people come to the site from mobile devices, and the development of applications for smartphones and tablets is becoming an important condition for most modern companies. <br>  One of the key categories of the site "From hand to hand" /irr.ru is "Real Estate" - and that is why in August 2013 an application of the same name for iOS systems appeared on the market.  Since launch, the number of users of this application has increased almost 20 times. <br><br>  Assessing the interest in the new service, the developers decided to expand the audience of the product and on April 30 released a version for the Android platform.  At the moment, every 20 users access the site from a mobile device, half of which are devices based on the Android operating system and one third are devices based on iOS.

      <b>Progressive solution</b> <br><br>  The Real Estate app has an intuitive interface and unique mechanics.  The ‚Äúknow-how‚Äù of the new product is found in an unusual search system for the Russian market.  You can select rental and purchase offers directly on the map - which allows you to find a suitable option in a few seconds. <br><br>  According to the expertise of the site "From hand to hand" /irr.ru, the vast majority of the audience in the category "Real Estate" are interested in rental ads (60%).  Therefore, immediately after launching, each user of the application falls into the ‚Äúrental‚Äù category.  Next, the system automatically determines your location.  All current ads appear on the map with different terms of sale or lease.  The label of each ad allows you to immediately determine the number of rooms in the apartment and its cost.  Without taking unnecessary actions, you get information about the location of the property, its characteristics and conditions of purchase.  The map search function provides a complete picture of the infrastructure of the area and the distance from public transport stops. <br><br>  The navigation which is thought over to trifles allows to move quickly on the map, concentrating attention to the main thing. <br>  Moreover, you can literally use your finger to outline the desired area or street on the map, after which the system starts displaying ads only within the selected zone.  So, without extra effort, you can maximize the geography of finding suitable options for renting or buying a home.  In this case, you do not need to understand the numerous filters, indicating the metro, area, number of rooms or room footage. <br><br>  For those who are accustomed to the traditional tools of the ‚ÄúReal Estate‚Äù section on the site, the developers have kept the standard filtering system: one click allows you to customize the delivery of ads in a sequential list.  Provided and advanced search: with it, you can manually set all the necessary parameters.  You can also sort offers by price, proximity to the center or to the subway. <br><br>  <b>Plans</b> <br><br>  At the moment in the arsenal of the site "From hand to hand" /irr.ru four free mobile applications that are available to users of the two most popular mobile platforms - iOS and Android.  Applications "Announcements", "Things", "Publications" and "Real Estate" have proved their relevance - their audience is constantly growing.  Creators continue to improve their products in the interests of consumers. <br><br>  So, in the near future, the Real Estate application for Android is waiting for a large-scale functional update.  The main innovation will be the option to submit ads, which is currently provided only for the iOS platform.  It is also supposed to create a personal account that will make working with the service as convenient as possible: it will allow you to sort, edit, and view statistics on your own ads. <br><br>  The next updated version of the Real Estate app on the iOS platform is scheduled for this summer. </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/225509/">https://habr.com/ru/post/225509/</a></p>
