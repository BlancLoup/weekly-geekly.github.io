On this day, the first large-scale event in Russia took place - the Dell Solutions Forum.  And today we would like to answer, perhaps, one of the eternal questions: what was all this for? <a name="habracut"></a>  But first some numbers.  In total, the forum brought together over a thousand participants: more than 600 people attended the event personally and about 500 watched the online broadcast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5cd/d10/986/5cdd109865c75b3460498aaea0335db2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In one day, we presented 15 reports covering the whole range of modern IT problems: from BYOD and desktop virtualization to the transition to a private cloud and effective data center management.  In parallel, in the hall of the exhibition center a ‚Äúdemo zone‚Äù was organized from the exhibition stands of sponsors and partners.  Each visitor could not only get comprehensive information on the presented joint solutions from Intel, Microsoft, Citrix and many others, <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/573/c89/ff4/573c89ff48e635c09ab975a2d072ccc0.jpg" alt="image">

      but also to "test" them right on the spot. <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/89d/a96/004/89da960043e9250694c9b3a632334d7b.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  What has Dell come to Russia with? </h4><br>  At the very beginning of the forum, Michael Dell welcomed the participants and stressed that Russia is an extremely important and dynamically developing market in which the company sees great prospects.  That is why the region has a special role in the Dell business. <br>  Some details of the plan to "conquer Russia" said the general director of Dell in Russia, Boris Shcherbakov. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/50e/c8a/a7c/50ec8aa7ce21be51c87cb9fa512d01e1.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  ‚ÄúThe plan envisages not only the promotion of products here, but also the implementation of intellectual resources in the Russian market.  Firstly, Dell was established as a legal entity in Russia, which had the opportunity to work like any Russian company, which is important for any legal procedure and for the closest interaction with partners and customers.  Our company will work in the Russian market in the same way that Dell works in the USA and other countries of the world, supplying its solutions here and providing its customers with a full range of services. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Do you want solutions?  I have them </h4><br>  Over time, everything changes, and if the company wants to be successful, it needs not only to offer customers quality solutions, but also to keep up with the times.  Judge for yourself, a lot has changed since the 50s: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f3/893/a6f/7f3893a6fdf0e3239a848c48c7ecc8dd.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Dell began its history in 1984 with a capital of only $ 1,000, and today it is a huge corporation with some of the best security, virtualization, storage and cloud technologies solutions in the industry.  This became possible not only thanks to our own developments, but also the integration of partner solutions into the company's products.  The ‚Äústrategic‚Äù acquisitions of recent years also played a big role.  Dell has already acquired about 20 third-party companies (Boomi, Clerity Solutions, Compellent, Equallogic, Quest, SonicWALL, Wyse Technology, etc.), which allowed customers to offer ‚Äúsolo‚Äù solutions from hardware to software.  Nor have they forgotten about R &amp; D, for which now about $ 1 billion is allocated annually. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c42/438/45d/c4243845d6f4bbf8caa7292738bdb5ac.png" alt="image"><br><br>  But along with the penetration of modern technologies into the lives of people, new problems have emerged that need to be solved. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/772/861/2fc/7728612fc4c7a7e68b8fda002af8dd31.png" alt="image"><br><br>  At the same time, there are no longer any global ‚Äúlinear‚Äù tasks.  One problem always, one way or another, captures several contiguous ones.  We think that Euler‚Äôs idea is more in demand today than ever) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/17c/49e/a34/17c49ea341316923de924b807277c29b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Read more in the presentation of Tony Parkinson, Dell Vice President for EMEA, "Dell's Strategy and Business Development Trends in the Corporate Sector" <div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15127398&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhI_MwBM4_dSa51cqGpU4Kp3nqyfw" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br><h4>  BYOD </h4><br>  Consider the popular concept of using personal devices for employees.  Everybody knows the BYOD abbreviation and the term ‚Äúconsumerization‚Äù, but not everyone understands how to benefit from this approach without increasing information security risks.  We at Dell don‚Äôt really like to theorize, so we‚Äôll tell you by example. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7f5/8b0/a15/7f58b0a15677904f71b40e7b7f24bbca.png" alt="image"><br><br>  This is the result, and now we will consider 4 steps, how we managed to achieve such results. <br>  <b>First</b> , choose the right devices for your employees.  In general, the designer and tester want the same thing - a computer.  But it is obvious that it will be two completely different machines, both in terms of hardware and the tasks performed on them.  Therefore, without a differentiated approach is not enough.  Of course, you can all buy "monsters" for $ 10,000 each, which will pull any load, but what's the point? <br>  Step <b>two</b> concerns security.  It is perhaps the cornerstone in the whole concept of BYOD.  Usually the company uses a "mix" of corporate and personal devices.  To organize data protection and at the same time not to violate anyone's rights - something that sooner or later you will come across.  Our solution: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/142/689/45a/14268945aba56d1bfb6862809756ad05.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>The third</b> step is optimization of access, management and deployment.  When the company "zoo" user devices, you inevitably encounter problems that I would like to solve centrally.  For example, the variety of platforms and operating systems on which you need to install different software, which, in turn, has a certain licensing period.  In this case, it is necessary to provide options for backups, remote deletion of information in case of theft, and a dozen more tasks.  Sometimes it seems that it is easier to leave everything ‚Äúas it is‚Äù (it seems to work, well, okay), but believe me, the result is worth the work done.  Especially when the solution to the problem is already known. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ecd/4e3/8d3/ecd4e38d36a904300bc7a7adb0cd07f4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  And finally, at the finish line, the <b>fourth</b> step is virtualization. <br>  More details in the presentation of Konstantin Isaakyan, director of consumer, small and medium business and distribution in Russia, Generation Y and IT "consumerization".  Increase productivity without compromising IT control. ‚Äù <div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15127291&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgRvLRp6BITRqxlGnTUuHY4q7i9kg" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br><h4>  Virtualization </h4><br>  Types of this is convenient to choose depending on the number of users and tasks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b48/59f/981/b4859f9814e41a368607e4efc1817223.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Indeed, there is no need to shoot a gun on the sparrows.  The main thing to remember is that the entire infrastructure should be convenient to manage. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/954/085/f99/954085f99b979e87ca252e2a49a14c04.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Read more in the presentation by Alexander Stepanov, Alexander Tarasov and Artem Panin "Desktop Virtualization through the Eyes of Dell" <br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15127420&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiuzUF0ghMRqgLTG6tG60rqouVpgQ" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br><h4>  Beyond Virtualization </h4>  As a result, it is often cheaper and more convenient to switch from virtualization to a private cloud, which will provide not only scalability, high performance and fault tolerance, but also more advanced management of virtual machines and virtual networks. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/458/69a/17a/45869a17adfd1b85ef46ff31bf5dd868.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Moreover, the cloud will allow you to build a flexible and inexpensive infrastructure based on the technologies that you already know. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/404/b73/9d5/404b739d52d74a56a7ac1a6dfffc6572.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Read more in the presentation of Dmitry Matchin (Dell) and Vasily Malanin (Microsoft) ‚ÄúReady-made recipes from Microsoft and Dell to build a virtual and cloud infrastructure.‚Äù <br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15127444&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiDis28YqTWvOeTLRjq3FH3NpXl0Q" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br>  And also in the presentation of Alexander Stepanov (Dell), Ivan Shumovsky (CROC) and Sergey Halyapin (Citrix Systems) ‚ÄúVDI.

Dell has something to offer here.  Remember the joke about "what's important in a tank"?  Leave it without ending and change the question.  And what is the main thing in the data center?  In our opinion - ease of use, flexible integration and security.  For a successful solution of this problem, you can use Dell OpenManage, in more detail about which Roman Samoilov (Dell), Konstantin Shurunov (Dell) and Dmitry Senchikhin (I-Teco) told at the Dell Solutions Forum. <br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/15127470&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700255,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhjqxFTchR9OXo4Lpxn1Rr8MKA2CrQ" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br>  Recently, another trend is characteristic of data centers - technology convergence.
