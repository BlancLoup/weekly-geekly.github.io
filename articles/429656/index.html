  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Artificial intelligence is also wrong. As in the US, we cheated Amazon Go - the store of the future without cashiers and sellers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On January 22, 2018, Amazon opened the world's first store without cash registers and vendors for residents in Seattle, and on October 23, this innovative store opened in San Francisco.  The store of the future without cash registers and Amazon Go sellers allows you to simply collect products from the shelves and get out!  The ‚Äúpick up and go‚Äù method is already called by many as ‚Äúthe future of retail sales‚Äù and its mass distribution is expected very soon.  Amazon Go is currently open in only three cities: three in Seattle, two in Chicago and one in San Francisco.  The company said it hopes to open 3,000 Amazon Go stores by 2021. <br><br>  We visited the store of the future without cashiers and salesmen in San Francisco in the first week of its opening, where we checked in detail the algorithms of machine learning and computer vision, the range of products and their prices. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nl/qm/em/nlqmem-y4v3at5hpkemtidiqydy.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, to start shopping, at the entrance to the store, you need to scan a personal QR code in the pre-downloaded Amazon Go application on your smartphone.  You need to enter the store through the turnstiles, like in the subway or bus, one account for several people, but for this you need to scan the QR code each time, letting the guests go ahead.  In this case, when the product takes your satellite / ca, the purchase will be recorded at the expense of the account holder.

      When visiting you need to remember two basic rules: <br><br><ol><li>  You cannot take a product from one customer to another; </li><li>  When returning a product taken from the shelf, it must be put in the same place. </li></ol><br>  After entering the store, the integrated Amazon system with hundreds of sensors on the shelves and computer vision cameras on the ceiling begins to track in detail the human behavior in the store.  Automated Amazon Go system using machine learning accumulates an array of data obtained to identify any product in the store with the buyer without bar codes and chips on the goods. <br><br>  Obvious advantages of this technology are getting rid of queues in supermarkets and reducing employees in the store.  Apparently, since the system only rolls around and people get to know how it works, the number of sales assistants per meter of retail space of the future Amazon Go store is now going off scale.  In addition, there are chefs working in cooking and employees who monitor the sales of alcohol and check the documents of customers. <br><br>  It should be noted that this system allows you to collect a huge array of data to analyze the behavior of customers, which allows Amazon to reach a new level of the big data market.  The resulting statistics can be used to improve the location of products, prices, range and even ingredients. <br><br>  During our visit and the informal test of the automated system, she gave an error - we <b>received an invoice for the goods that we looked at in the store, but did not buy</b> .  We must pay tribute to the fact that the refund took less than 1 minute and did not require any proceedings with the support service or ‚Äúcashiers‚Äù of the store. <br><br>  To see a detailed review of the store, the range and return of the mistakenly paid goods, see the video below. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vV75D-w7vXU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>Do you think there will be success with such automated stores without cashiers in Russia?</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/429656/">https://habr.com/ru/post/429656/</a></p>
