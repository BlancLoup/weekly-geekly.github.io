      The title of the article is a question of paramount importance for me, which arose as a result of a recent conversation with the heads of departments and ordinary employees. <br><br>  In fact, if you are a leader and cannot rally your team, you are a bad boss.  Harsh, but true. <br><br>  If you are a member of this team, and cohesion leaves much to be desired - you are a bad employee.  Harsh, but true. <br><br>  As an ordinary employee is a part of a team, he, like a manager, is responsible for the success of a common cause.  If the boss cannot rally the team, the employees themselves must do it. <br><br>  But how do you know if the team is united or not?  In fact, this is felt intuitively, there is no need to explain. <br><br>  If you need an example, pay attention to the behavior of top teams.  Is there open and honest communication, do the employees feel responsible for each other, do they all sing along to the same tune, is there room for healthy debates? <br><br>  Another way to look at this is to ask whether the microclimate is healthy in the team, do all departments work in harmony, or does each one pull the blanket over himself?  If they do not work the way they would like, maybe the reason is a mirror image of the leadership's behavior?  And again, harsh, but true. <br><br>  So what can you do?  If this question hurts you, then we should talk about it.  I'm serious, let's understand! <br><br><h2>  <font color="#0071c5">Three steps to rally the team:</font> </h2><br>  <b>1. Make sure that you have exactly the management system that allows the business to prosper.</b>  If there is no right system, then you use the right medicine, but not for that wound!  In truth, there is little point in trying to rally a team that is improperly organized.  I have met a lot of executive directors who were shaking off talking about cohesion and team organization.  This behavior of a manager always leads to a slowdown in work, and then to disappointment when it is not possible to obtain the expected results.  (We recommend reading a useful article on <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/potryasayushchaya-produktivnost-5-sposobov-povysheniya-komandnoy-proizvoditelnosti/">5 ways to increase team productivity</a> .) <br><br>  <b>2. Find time and energy to revise your goal, opinion, and values.</b>  If there is no cohesion in the department, then the manager and the staff have lost sight of this important point.  You need to make the team one.  To do this, it will be necessary to convey to each employee of the team the importance of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcohesion, so that people like this mood.  The process is not fast, so a one-time exercise is indispensable.  Spend more time with your subordinates, communicate and raise your team spirit.  This is not an exercise in the literal sense of the word, it is the minds and hearts of employees.  If the team does not "sick soul" for the common cause, it is not able to lead the business to prosperity. <br><br>  <b>3. Facilitate the interchange of information between departments.</b>  It happens that the departments are as if isolated from each other.  Separation of departments is an integral part of development.  However, when it becomes the norm, it becomes problematic to lead units.  To allow isolation is the same as walking on quicksand.  Managers are always responsible for the emergence and spread of isolation sentiments in the department, because they could not convince people to share their opinions and share a common point of view.  In most cases, separate departments appear as a result of insufficient communication between the head and subordinates.  Sometimes it is provoked by anger, then you need to find a source of negativity and remove such people from the team.  They are a tumor that harms the work.  You can prevent the appearance of isolated departments by communicating with employees.  Talk about goals, opinions and values, share company results. <br><br>  Team cohesiveness is crucial for the future success of any business, it is achieved through management efforts. <br><br>  PS We recommend another article on the topic - <a href="http://blog.mbaconsult.ru/blog/personal/chtoby-stat-liderom-dlya-drugikh-stante-snachala-liderom-dlya-sebya/">To become a leader for others, first become a leader for yourself</a> . <br><br>  Translated by Vyacheslav Davidenko, founder of <a href="http://www.mbaconsult.ru/">MBA Consult</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289300/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289300/</a></p>
