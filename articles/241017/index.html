As a rule, after the transaction (sale), the company completely ceases to meet the client until the sales manager has to re-execute the transaction (sale) and fulfill the plan.  Those.  individual mercenary goals and no romance, and it's terrible. <br><br>  And now let's look at living examples of how a company should really work with its customers, and what it does to them.  I know perfectly well that similar cases are typical for other companies, but in my examples I am analyzing large companies with a large number of clients.  After all, we know perfectly well that serving 5 customers well and 5,000 customers are completely different things. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Logitech - when conscience no longer allows </h4><br>  In the world of premium devices and devices, there are many brands that offer peripherals of excellent quality.  And, as a rule, they promote their products through motivating employees of retail companies with good bonuses and sponsoring various events and competitions.  But there is one company that primarily pays attention to its customers, and her name is Logitech. <br><br>  There is a legend that only conscience can force the consumer to go and buy a new Logitech device.  And it all lies in the amazing support of their company customers.  If, say, your mouse broke, and it is still under the company's warranty for 3 years (and not a year, as retail chains say), you can write to the Logitech website, and almost always the company will go to the meeting and replace the device.  And if such a model is no longer available, you will be sent a new version.  How can you not love such a company? <br><br>  In the network and in the Habr√© you can find many real cases where nothing but ‚ÄúWow‚Äù can be said.  For example, a <a href="http://geektimes.ru/post/147176/">link to Geektimes.</a> <br><br><h4>  REG.ru - every client is equally valuable </h4><br>  There are a number of activities and activities aimed at increasing the level of sales and awareness of customers about new services and current promotions.  This is a standard practice and in this regard REG.ru are true professionals.  However, due to the large size of our country, there are objective restrictions on certain types of shares. <br><br>  For example, they recently invited to visit their booth at the exhibition, where they played small souvenirs and pleasant trifles.  Obviously, while living in Vladivostok, I could not attend this event.  And as a person, a little ‚Äúaddicted to funny things,‚Äù I was a little sad that I could not attend the exhibition. <br><br>  However, having written a request to REG.RU, I was sent to a meeting, and on the day of the exhibition I received a courier for myself some funny things.  And this is great. <br><br>  Yes, this is not related to business processes, but I was really amazed that my application was reviewed and went to the meeting.  How many companies will still burden themselves with such trifles? <br><br><h4>  Retail store - more than a showcase </h4><br>  When buying a new TV in the local network of home appliances, I also noticed a stand with laptops, where I discussed several options with the hall manager for about 3-4 minutes.  But referring to the high price, I said that I would buy the laptop myself later, when I saved up money. <br><br>  After 2 months, the manager of the trading hall called me and said that they had a laptop in the delivery that might interest me.  The trick was that the front side had a scratch of about 4 centimeters, which made it unsuitable for sale, and its price was 65% lower than the price in a retail store.  Without thinking for a long time, I arrived at the store and bought myself a nice laptop for a small price. <br><br>  As I later learned, they have in the store a system for tracking the desires of the buyer.  During promotions, discounts and markdowns, they first of all purposefully target interested consumers, and only then post the goods on the shop window.  And this is a city in the Far East, how do you approach this? <br><br><h4>  Conclusion on customer orientation: </h4><br>  When you want to become a customer-oriented company, you need to think not only about the global strategy of customer service, but also to pay attention to simple trifles.  It is from them that a positive impression is created about the brand, as a company that really values ‚Äã‚Äãits customers. <br><br>  Try and perhaps the legends about the quality of service will begin to go about your company. <br><br>  Have you had cases of unbelievable attitude towards you? <br><br>  <b>Important:</b> If you think that this topic is better placed on gigtime - throw in a personal. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/241017/">https://habr.com/ru/post/241017/</a></p>
