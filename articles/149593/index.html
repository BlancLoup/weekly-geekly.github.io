  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Internet of things - and what is it?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Good day, friends! <br>  Actually more and more often on the Internet, a description of various Internet devices appears.  Someone has made his own <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/149289/">Internet outlet</a> , so the guys offer <a href="http://www.electricimp.com/">to manage refrigerators, coffee makers, etc.</a> , but in general - <a href="http://www.streetline.com/">‚Äúsmart‚Äù parking</a> . <br>  But, as it turned out, not many people actually represent what the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù is. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e04/540/c95/e04540c95dd3043dec36635c41bb0bf9.jpg"><br>  This article should be useful to many, at least "for common development." <br>  So anyone interested, welcome under cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Instead of introducing </h4><br>  Once I heard the phrase "the concept of the Internet of things."  From one formulation, it immediately became clear that we are talking about things that have access to the network.  Then I was not particularly interested in this area.  After a while I heard the phrase: "The Internet of Things ...".  Even then I thought that the man had made a reservation, because  the phrase was kind of ridiculous.  But then more and more I began to hear the same phrase, while my brain refused to perceive it, until I finally decided to read about it in more detail.  After reading only the original title - Internet of Things, I immediately realized that hearing ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù, I tried to connect it with the concept of ‚ÄúInternet things‚Äù, and not with the ‚Äúnetwork of things‚Äù.  Actually, because of such a funny situation, I became interested in this issue. <br>  By the way, it‚Äôs interesting, but this phrase seemed ridiculous to me at first glance, or did everyone have exactly the same feeling (of course, if you didn‚Äôt hear the English-language wording)? <br><br><h4>  Some interesting facts from the history </h4><br>  Let's see what we have interesting in the story was related to the Internet of things.  Of course there are a lot of facts: the creation of the Internet itself, the creation of the first page on the network, etc., probably don‚Äôt list them all, so I‚Äôll write the most interesting, as it seems to me, those closest to the Internet of Things. <br><ul><li>  In 1926, Nikola Tesla said in an interview for the magazine Collier's that in the future the radio will be transformed into a ‚Äúbig brain‚Äù, all things will become part of a whole, and the tools that make it possible will easily fit in your pocket. </li><li>  In 1990, MIT graduate, one of the fathers of the TCP / IP protocol, John Romki created the first Internet thing in the World.  He connected his toaster to the net. </li><li>  The term "Internet of Things" (Internet of Things) was proposed by Kevin Ashton in 1999.  In the same year, the Auto Identification Center (Auto-ID Center) was established, which deals with radio frequency identification (RFID) and sensor technologies, thanks to which this concept was widely adopted. </li><li>  In 2008-2009 there was a transition from the ‚ÄúInternet of people‚Äù to the ‚ÄúInternet of things‚Äù, i.e.  The number of items connected to the network exceeded the number of people. </li></ul><br><h4>  What is the Internet of things? </h4><br>  Now we will understand more formal issues. <br>  There are many definitions of the Internet of Things.  We will understand the Internet of things as a single network connecting the objects of the real world that surround us and the virtual objects. <br>  <i>IOT - the concept of a space in which everything from the analog and digital worlds can be combined - it will redefine our relationships with objects, as well as the properties and essence of the objects themselves.</i>  ¬© Rob Van Kranenburg. <br><br>  According to one definition, from the point of view of IoT, a <i>‚Äúthing‚Äù is any real or virtual object that exists and moves in space and time and can be uniquely defined</i> [interesting, by the way, how does a virtual object move in space? :)]. <br>  Those.  The Internet of Things is not just a multitude of different devices and sensors, interconnected by wired and wireless communication channels and connected to the Internet, but a closer integration of the real and virtual worlds, in which communication takes place between people and devices.

      In the future, ‚Äúthings‚Äù are supposed to become active participants in business, information and social processes, where they can interact and communicate with each other, exchanging information about the environment, reacting and influencing the processes occurring in the outside world, without human intervention. <br>  According to Rob Van Kranenburg, the Internet of Things is a ‚Äúfour-layer pie‚Äù. <br><ul><li>  Level 1 is associated with the identification of each object. </li><li>  Level 2 provides the customer service with the service (can be considered as a network of its own "things", a particular example is the "smart home"). </li><li>  Level 3 is associated with urbanization of urban life.  Those.  This is the concept of a ‚Äúsmart city‚Äù, where all the information that concerns the residents of this city is pulled down to a specific residential area, to your home and neighboring houses. </li><li>  Level 4 - sensory planet. </li></ul><br>  In other words, the Internet of things can be viewed as a network of networks in which small, small-bound networks form larger ones. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/e80/f68/f60/e80f68f601bc0b869ab7df9006f9a668.jpg"><br>  It goes without saying that a common language is necessary for communication and interaction of devices.  Cisco conducted a thorough technical analysis that showed that IP could well be adapted to the requirements of a new type of network.  In this case, the ‚ÄúInternet of Things‚Äù will receive the same benefits: compatibility, scalability and, most importantly, a single common language - which at one time turned a complex array of private and public networks into a single global communication system known as the Internet. <br>  Immediately, I note that in this case IP is just a means of communication, one might say, the ‚Äúvocal cords and ears‚Äù of devices.  But we are not talking about a single language of communication here, but I will tell about this in another article that I will write later. <br><br><h4>  Technology </h4><br>  This concept is associated, as a rule, with the development of two technologies.  These are radio frequency identification (RFID) and wireless sensor networks (BSN). <br>  This is what the wiki tells us. <br><br><h5>  Wireless sensor networks </h5><br>  A wireless sensor network is a distributed, self-organizing network of multiple sensors (sensors) and actuators connected to each other via a radio channel.  Moreover, the coverage area of ‚Äã‚Äãsuch a network can range from several meters to several kilometers due to the ability to relay messages from one element to another. <br>  This technology is used to solve many practical problems associated with monitoring, management, logistics, etc. <br><br><h5>  RFID </h5><br>  RFID (English Radio Frequency Identification, radio frequency identification) is a method of automatic identification of objects in which data stored in so-called transponders or RFID tags are read or written using radio signals. <br>  This technology is well suited to track the movement of some objects and to obtain a small amount of information from them.  So, for example, if all products were equipped with RFID tags, and a refrigerator with an RFID reader, then it could easily track the shelf life of products, and we could, for example, when leaving work remotely, look at the refrigerator and determine what needs to be purchased. still. <br><br><h4>  Problems and disadvantages </h4><br>  The main problem today is the lack of standards in this area, which makes it difficult to integrate the solutions offered on the market and in many ways restrains the emergence of new ones. <br>  Also for the full functioning of such a network, the autonomy of all ‚Äúthings‚Äù is necessary, i.e.  Sensors must learn to receive energy from the environment, and not work on batteries, as is happening now. <br><br>  The presence of a huge network that controls the entire world around us, global openness of data and other features can have negative consequences.  I think everyone can make a list of possible threats and problems that this technology carries in them. <br><br>  I can not cite one quote here that I really liked: <br>  ‚Äú <i>- Yes, it didn‚Äôt break,‚Äù he said reluctantly, ‚Äúbut ... you know, my temperature is a little below the norm. Not the house, but the body! Not thirty-six and six, but thirty-six and one-tenth. Well, there is such people, two or three in a million, is also like a norm, even though on the very edge. But this stupid smart house, how smart is it? - it demands that I take some pills! .. Now we must either turn off this system, or reprogrammed, and it will call and to work, he already did that last week, when he learned that I was constipated, now even the vacuum cleaners in the office are in the office</i>  <i>ut as soon as I enter ...</i> "¬© Yuri Nikitin Scouts. <br><br><h4>  And what from this? </h4><br>  Well, in order not to end on a negative note, I want to say that all the same flaws are not significant compared to what opportunities the Internet of Things can provide. <br><br>  With the development of the Internet of Things, more and more items will connect to the global network, thereby creating new opportunities in the field of security, analytics and management, opening up new and broader perspectives and contributing to improving the quality of life of the population. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! <br><br>  In the next article I will tell you in more detail about the architecture and protocols, as well as consider several existing implementations. <br><br>  PS I would like to hear your attitude to this concept and perhaps some additions / changes to the presented material. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/149593/">https://habr.com/ru/post/149593/</a></p>
