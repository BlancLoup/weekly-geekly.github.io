  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A million lemmings can not be wrong?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Quite a long time ago it became fashionable to be "positive."  Well, that kind of optimist, smile and enjoy every manifestation of life.  As it happens with every trend, as soon as it gains strength, millions of lemmings pick it up and begin to put into life in form, but not in content.  People who hear the stamps from the series ‚ÄúBe more positive!‚Äù, ‚ÄúSmile, and people will reach for you‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe main thing is optimism in life‚Äù is very amusing.  People, not knowing what to write, write this blizzard even in their pages on dating sites.  Moreover, the more they write, the clearer the truth behind these lines is: loneliness, unfulfilled hopes, fear. <br><br>  You look at the person, and you are surprised.  Everything seems to be bad for him, but he is trying his best to pose as an optimist.  What for?  And because it is so accepted, for the sake of a social stamp, that a successful person must be optimistic and believe in the best.  Although, of course, this stamp has some prerequisites.  A person who is confident in himself is not afraid of the future.  But this self-confidence does not cause demonstrations of confidence to others. <br><br>  On the contrary, it generates only a backlash - leads to the fact that a person becomes ineffective.  He spends too much energy on appearing instead of being.  Frustration, melancholy, depression - these are important elements in the work of the psyche.  What it is?  But simply, when a person does something wrong, and subconsciously understands this, he comes, for example, into depression.  He often himself can not explain what happened, but no mood.  At this time, his subconscious mind handles the situation, draws lessons so that next time he can do everything correctly.  And to interfere with this process is not necessary, it is natural, just like pain and fear, which, as you know, work to survive and maintain the integrity of the body.

      But lemmings do not understand this, they must have a "pasitiff" always and everywhere.  It seems to me that our civilization is moving further and further away from the real world, from the real understanding of how things are arranged.  All fill images and stamps. <br>  Earn a million - although, if you ask, what for is he, a person at first will not find what to answer, and then he will carry some crap about apartments, cars and yachts. <br>  Lose weight - although with such a lifestyle, which lead most of us, do not need a good physical shape.  And the way of life in which it is needed, and moreover, it will come by itself, is elementary frightening us.  Instead, we are exhausting a poor body in fitness, painfully trying to not eat anything and, as a rule, failing, which leaves us depressed and frustrated. <br>  Finding love - although what most of us are looking for (and many throughout life), simply does not exist in the form described in the books and regulated by social morality.  It sounds pathetic, but it is a giant deception since childhood) What we call love consists of two completely different components that cannot live together - but this is a topic for a separate post) <br>  Yes, and we are looking for, again, essentially starting from other people's opinions about what is beautiful.  Glossy magazines, where Photoshop fixes everything (sometimes even navel is accidentally covered).  Advertising.  Models.  This is what creates taste.  I think people who met people from TV live know how strong the difference is between image and reality.  But such units. <br><br>  Could a million lemmings be wrong?  I think yes.  Just to make mistakes, or just to confuse the cause with the effect, is not so important.  It happens every day and, in general, it should be so.  Because some clever lemmings can use this to achieve their goals.  Good to be a smart lemming?  Yes, - say millions of others) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53886/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53886/</a></p>
