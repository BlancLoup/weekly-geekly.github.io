This is part of the fans that were redundant and were dismantled from twenty servers in a test rack located in the DataPro data center.  Under the cut - traffic.  Illustrated description of our cooling system.  And an unexpected offer for very economical, but a little fearless owners of server hardware. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><p>  The cooling system of the server equipment based on the contour heat pipes is considered as an alternative to the fluid system.  Compared to efficiency, it is cheaper to implement and operate.  At the same time, even in theory, it does not allow leakage of fluid inside expensive server equipment. </p><br><p>  Last year, our first experimental rack was mounted in the DataPro data center.  It consists of forty identical Supermicro servers.  The first twenty of them with a standard cooling system, the second twenty - with a modified.  The purpose of the experiment is to test the applicability of our cooling system in a real data center, in a real rack, in real servers. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/et/iz/un/etizun-ojnlquei4arakzelszna.jpeg"></p><br><p>  I apologize for the quality of some photos.  Then they didn‚Äôt particularly bother, but now there is no opportunity to retake the process.  Also many photos are vertical.  Like the hero of this publication, the server rack. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/n8/tw/or/n8twor_rbzzzcojboesdxe83mlq.jpeg"></p><br><p>  At the top of the rack are located the usual server.  Below - a heat exchange tire with devices for clamping servers of unusual, (almost) fanless.  Fans were only for blowing memory.  From processors, heat is brought to the heat exchanger using our loop heat pipes.  And from the heat exchanger, the heat on the liquid bus goes somewhere else. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nq/fn/tg/nqfntgkoyylzdvzyrak2uj0afy4.jpeg"></p><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5is8V13mBbU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><p>  This may be a street adiabatic.  These put on the roofs of buildings.  Or next to the buildings. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/u0/1d/bo/u01dbo7urnz4jgsshsgfh69ajhs.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Or maybe, for example, a heating system.  Or an eco-farm for growing vegetables.  Or a warm outdoor pool.  Or some other fruit of your imagination.  Required coolant temperature 40-60 ¬∞ C. </p><br><p>  Stand assembly looks like this. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/tt/4p/kd/tt4pkdureokvcz0kpcyry90bymi.jpeg"></p><br><p>  View of thermal interfaces.  Do not be afraid, this is only the first revision. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/rr/10/7s/rr107sjspjzh4g85czlrttrsfwe.jpeg"></p><br><p>  Even more severe look.  Yes, it is Made In Russia.  :) </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/b7/dj/ng/b7djngujw89korqakc2s4y61j-q.jpeg"></p><br><p>  The second revision will look noticeably less severe.  Perhaps even a bit cute. </p><br><h2 id="ischem-ekonomnyh-i-otvazhnyh">  We are looking for the budget and the brave </h2><br><p>  Today we came close to the task of assembling a new rack.  Based on the second revision of our server cooling system.  It will also be placed in DataPro Data Center.  But what is required for this?  Nothing less than forty of the same type of hot servers. </p><br><p>  We are ready to buy some hot, though not very new servers for our needs.  But before this sin is not to ask the habr-community.  Perhaps someone wants to participate with their iron in our experiment? </p><br><p>  In this case, we will have a chance to work with something much more fresh than we acquire ourselves.  And, which is much more valuable, this is something that will work under a real, not synthetic, load. </p><br><p>  In exchange from us - free integration of our cooling system into your server rack.  The approximate market value of such an "upgrade" is about 1.5 million rubles.  From our partners, DataPro, a discount on placing such a modified rack in their data center.  The discount amount will be discussed additionally with the interested party. </p><br><p>  We have the ability to make modifications to the server equipment with the warranty.  We have already entered into partnership agreements with Lenovo, IBM and DELL, and we are working to expand this list. </p><br><p>  All the brave will be glad to see in a personal <a href="https://habr.com/ru/users/webself/" class="user_link">webself</a> here on Habr√© or on any contact listed in my profile.  And for those who are interested in the topic of cooling (including server) computer equipment, I remind you about our social networks <a href="https://vk.com/thercon">VKontakte</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thercon_lhp/">Instagram</a> .  A certain amount of informative video content is expected in them soon.  Do not let yourself miss. </p></div>
