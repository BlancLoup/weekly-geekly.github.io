      Today you are nothing but a mixture of all that you have become throughout your life up to the present moment.  Today, your ‚ÄúI‚Äù has both strengths and weaknesses, character traits and moods, intelligence and skills, hobbies and interests, dreams and desires.  Today you may be able to get more from life, but tomorrow you will be able to give you what you still want. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In the future, you are the one who builds his own empire or gets a job in one of the best firms in the industry you are in or reach the top of the career ladder.  This is the one who realizes your dreams, if today you devote yourself to more effectively exerting influence and being useful to others, developing those skills that you will master perfectly in the future. <br><br>  Take these seven steps to become an improved version of yourself in the future. <br><br><h4>  Step 1: Feel you deserve success </h4><br>  To feel that you have the right to education, success and worthy of your goals and aspirations, it is very important to become who you want.  You can achieve your goals, but for this you must believe that you deserve them.  No matter where you are now and what your past was, you must forgive yourself of past failures and disappointments and feel that you deserve success.  Do not just know that you deserve success - feel it! <br><br><h4>  Step 2: Develop your own strategic plan </h4><br>  Creating a personal strategic plan involves a complete inventory of all the resources and abilities that you currently have.  Then add those abilities and resources that the future has for you.  As soon as you reveal gaps in your knowledge and experience, you will be able to focus on those areas that you personally consider to be priorities and to catalyze the acquisition of the necessary skill sets.  Future you will still have all the knowledge, talents and skills that you possess today.  But in order to achieve your future goals, you will need to develop existing ones and acquire new knowledge, talents and skills.  Make your own strategic plan that will show you the vector of development for the realization of your goals. <br><br><h4>  Step 3: Become outstanding in your field </h4><br>  Regardless of whether you have recently started to think about your field of interest or are already an experienced expert, you need to follow the latest developments in your industry and have good competitive knowledge in related areas.  As a result, it will give you the depth and breadth of knowledge that will attract people who come to you for advice.  Obtaining knowledge or resources that give access to knowledge, you will be able to achieve the influence that you will need in the future to realize your goals.  Analyze how others have become outstanding personalities in your area of ‚Äã‚Äãinterest.  Ponder what you should learn from them and repeat the necessary steps. <br><br><h4>  Step 4: Seek advice from an expert </h4><br>  Whatever industry you work in, there will always be people who are already recognized as experts in it, and most likely there are a lot of them.  Ask them for advice.  The easiest way to get expert advice is to look into a bookstore or library.  By simply reading or listening to books, I was privileged to receive advice from Warren Buffet (Warren Buffet), Oprah Winfrey (Oprah Winfrey), Jack Welch (Jack Welch), Tim Ferriss and countless other professionals without even meeting them .  Allocating time to read non-fiction books related to your industry and related business areas will allow you to be aware of all the changes, make you more flexible and help you to understand your niche well. <br><br><h4>  Step 5: Do something worthwhile every day. </h4><br>  Small actions to achieve your goals should be done daily, it will build for you the life that you draw in your imagination. <br><br>  <i>Not one single action, but a series of daily disciplined actions will help you get where you want.</i> <br><br>  Do it every day to develop the habit of constant self-development.  In life, you either progress in your development or regress.  You become either something big, or you lose something.  You either move towards your goals, or from them.  Daily performing disciplined actions aimed at becoming a future successful self, you do yourself the honor and perpetuate the habit of constant self-development within yourself. <br><br><h4>  Step 6: Analyze which of your classes are higher in priority. </h4><br>  Ask yourself several times a day: ‚ÄúAm I working for the good of my future right now?‚Äù Let the image of the future always be before your eyes.  Look at the world and change your actions in the context of what will be useful for the future of you. <br><br>  <i>When you prioritize your activities, based on how they benefit you in the future, you will have clear judgments aimed at achieving your personal goals.</i> <br><br>  These judgments will help you to have a complete picture of your actions and will give you the opportunity to change them for the better. <br><br><h4>  Step 7: Take full responsibility for your own decisions. </h4><br>  Only you are responsible for working for the good of your ideal and whether you will in the future be the one you aspire to.  Today you are the result of the many choices you made yesterday and on all previous days up to this point.  If today you have decided to do or not do something for the good of the ideal that you strive to achieve in the future, then admit that it was your choice.  You are free to choose who you will become.  When you take full responsibility for your decisions and actions, you will give yourself the opportunity to grow and change.  Then you can learn self-control.  Then you can be your future self. <br><br>  Take these seven steps to get on your path to success.  Set goals and reach them.  Go round difficulties and pass through obstacles that depress others.  Gain strength, hope, clarity and experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76b/eef/901/76beef9014914ac1bde6275101294c68.jpg"><br><br>  Be confident in your intentions and fulfill your commitments with perseverance.  And may these seven steps help you become the perfect self to which you need to strive. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/294044/">https://habr.com/ru/post/294044/</a></p>
