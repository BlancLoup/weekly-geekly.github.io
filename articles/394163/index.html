  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Skype Out and other VoIP services will still block: the draft Ministry of Communications published</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Ministry of Communications and Mass Media has finally completed work on new rules for connecting telecommunication networks, which <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/273470/">have been talked</a> about for a <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/273470/">long time</a> .  For several years now, there has been a problem in the industry that Internet instant messengers and VoIP services offer users cheap long-distance communication and drive voice traffic over the Internet, thereby violating the rules for connecting to Russian telecommunications networks.  Instead of the standard charge for an international call ($ 0.14 per minute), Russian operators only get paid for a local call (a little more than $ 0.01).  Soon, this "chaos" will stop. <br><br>  The draft government decree " <a href="https://regulation.gov.ru/projects">On Amendments to Certain Acts of the Government of the Russian Federation in Part of the Interaction of Telecommunication Networks</a> " was published on the portal <i>regulation.gov.ru</i> .  The new edition of the list of those who can join the local, zonal and other networks <b>excluded data transmission operators for the purpose of transmitting voice information</b> , that is, VoIP operators. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Until now, the activities of VoIP operators have not been described in the legislation.  If the project is accepted, VoIP subscribers will not be able to call fixed and mobile phones, and vice versa. <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">The text of the draft resolution</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  <b>And Z M E N E N And I,</b>

Limit prices for call completion services in a constituent entity of the Russian Federation, as well as call initiation in a constituent entity of the Russian Federation are not subject to differentiation. ‚Äù; <br><br>  clause 19 recognize invalid; <br><br>  clause 20 shall read as follows: <br><br>  "20.

If the telecom operator has set prices for traffic transmission services that exceed the regulated prices for services from the List of traffic transmission services provided by the operator occupying a significant position in the public communication network, the latter in each settlement period in addition to the total amount for transmission services traffic provided to the operator, includes the amount of compensation. <br><br>  The amount of compensation is calculated as the difference in prices for traffic transmission services from the List of traffic transmission services established by the parties to the interconnection agreement, multiplied by the volume of traffic transmission services provided to an operator occupying a significant position in the public communication network. ‚Äù <br><br>  b) Section II of the list of interconnection services and traffic transmission services provided by operators occupying a significant position in a public telecommunications network, the prices of which are subject to state regulation, approved by this decree, shall be amended as follows: <br><br>  ‚ÄúII.

For example, a representative of Rostelecom, Valery Kostarev, said: ‚ÄúWe will study the draft as presented by the editors and send our opinion, but on the whole we share the ministry‚Äôs approach.  It will eliminate the imbalance in the economic conditions of work for mobile and fixed operators. ‚Äù <br><br>  Other experts did not support the disconnection of VoIP from telephone networks: ‚ÄúA number of innovations are surprising and do not correspond to modern trends in the development of inter-operator relations.  For example, a total ban on the accession of VoIP operators to the public telephone network, ‚Äùsaid Evgeny Vasilyev, director general of Interregional Transit Telecom (MTT, provides traffic transit services, long-distance and international communications, IP telephony, etc.).  The proposed solutions in the field of tariff rules ‚Äúcan significantly redraw the inter-operator and end markets, giving unfounded preferences to a significant operator, and in fact lead to the monopolization of the fixed-line market‚Äù. <br><br>  For Viber, Skype and other VoIP-operators, calls to mobile and fixed phones are one of the main methods of monetization.  Many users are also accustomed to making VoIP calls to regular phones, which is much cheaper than Rostelecom‚Äôs standard tariffs for international voice communication. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394163/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394163/</a></p>
