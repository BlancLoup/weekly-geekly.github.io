But I always returned to Nokia's candy bars (I still have it as a spare!). <br>  And here I just <b>needed a</b> smartphone, for I became the whole branch director: corporate mail, calendars and other effective manager tools.

      So, the choice was the following: Android or iOS.  Or rather, I chose from 2 Sony Xperia and iPhone 4s devices. <br>  I won the iPhone for 2m reasons: <br><ol><li>  It is difficult to learn the old monkey new tricks.  I already had experience using the iPad and iPhone, which I gave my wife.  Android devices did not have any. </li><li>  My friend went to the USA and could bring me an iPhone for a reasonable $ 700 (taking into account the sales tax). </li></ol><br><br>  At that moment I thought that those people who, all other things being equal, make a choice on the basis of price are thousands. <br>  The ratio of the number of imported hi-tech gadgets to manufactured in Russia is close to 100%. <br>  There is a need to buy abroad! <br>  Yes, there are online stores and the same e-bay with delivery to the address. <br>  But: <br><ul><li>  ordinary people want a simple one: a maximum of 10 clicks to buy a product, and not to <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/boxowerview/blog/200680/">turn a purchase into a feat</a> </li><li>  if you find out that your friend is flying from the ‚ÄúStates‚Äù, then you will ask 99% of him to bring your gadget with you! </li></ul><br>  So why not create a search service "one-time friends", those who can buy and bring you the same gadget that you suddenly wanted? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Next, I looked around for what is on the market. <br>  Found startups "each other" and youdo.  I thought: ‚ÄúWell, in half a year, these guys will grow up and make my world more comfortable!‚Äù <br>  And I decided not to become a "start-up", but to remain an "effective manager." <br>  Then I left the company and so far, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have to do anything to anyone,‚Äù went traveling. <br><br>  During the trip, I ‚Äúfell ill‚Äù with surfing (both kite and regular) and found that the price of equipment (and the accompanying gadgets) are seriously overestimated, and the delivery to the places of skiing is even more complicated or is ‚Äúspace‚Äù. <br>  At the same time, ‚Äúvacationers‚Äù / travelers from ‚Äúcivilized‚Äù places constantly come to popular places of riding.  Where the market for goods is greater, competition is higher, which means prices are lower. <br><br>  Those of you who work on the ‚Äúremote‚Äù and spent the winter in Asia will understand how sometimes you want sausage and herring! <br><br>  In general, the need for purchase and delivery has not gone away, and existing projects somehow did not hurry to help me.  And then it turned out that "each other" was closed at all, and Youdo had enough business in Moscow / St. Petersburg. <br><br>  And then, having investigated the market and did not find, at that time, living projects, I decided what to do! <br>  And 4.11 we launched our <a href="http://svezet.ru/">site</a> . <br><br>  After the site was opened, they sent me links to similar projects. <br>  But it is even good, it means there is a need. <br>  Competition will make the service user friendly (which I myself am). <br>  Audience coverage will also increase, which is vital for crowdsourcing projects. <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/svezet/blog/203566/">Article how to solve the</a> problem of "trust on the Internet." <br><br>  PS The guys who bought the Nexus 5 remotely - my respect!  But this is not a recipe for shopping every day. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/203284/">https://habr.com/ru/post/203284/</a></p>
