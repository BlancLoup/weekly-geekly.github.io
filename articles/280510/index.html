We have already discussed the complexity of the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pechkin/blog/277259/">fight against spam</a> , the future of email, the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pechkin/blog/276761/">protection of postal correspondence</a> , as well as the techniques of <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pechkin/blog/275809/">working with email</a> , used by the leaders of large IT companies. <br><br>  Today we will touch on another interesting topic - why users unsubscribe from email newsletters, and what they should be in order to be useful. <a name="habracut"></a>

    <h4>  Statistics: which newsletters do not like people </h4><br>  Unroll.me service, which helps to unsubscribe from unwanted mailings, in 2014 published <a href="https://econsultancy.com/blog/64097-email-marketing-what-makes-people-unsubscribe/">its own statistics</a> on user preferences.  According to the collected data, users most often unsubscribe from the flower delivery services, the sale of tickets to concerts, air tickets, party goods, as well as the search for interesting events and events in the neighborhood. <br><br>  Many of these services are used only in special, isolated cases.  If suddenly romantic impulses will prevail over a conditional man, the promotional offer from the flower delivery site will be very helpful, but he is unlikely to use this service all the time.  Therefore, even if the user will receive notifications from this service only on the eighth of March, this is still not the best idea. <br><br>  The same goes for sites like Expedia: most users don't buy tickets and tours too often, and even though it's nice to take a moment and take advantage of discounts, such messages rarely come at the right time. <br><br>  No matter how much we may like to go to the Christmas fair to the other end of the world, the budget and planning play an important role in making such decisions, therefore, having made a purchase of this kind, the user is unlikely to be interested in a similar offer soon.  In this case, sending dozens of e-mails is simply meaningless. <br><br><h4>  What do they like to read </h4><br>  The results of the Unroll.me study suggest that users read ezines that are somehow related to communication.  For example, a large number of email messages are sent by various social networks, but people rarely unsubscribe from them. <br><br>  In addition, people want to stay up to date on events on their favorite sites - some find it easier to find out about updates via email, although advertising messages from the same favorite sites attract them less. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0de/863/cae/0de863caecab4cb393fbceddc0ac26e4.png"><br><br>  So, here is a list of resources where a large number of users are subscribed to the newsletter: <br><br><ol><li>  Facebook: 70% of users are subscribed to the newsletter. </li><li>  Google+: 66.9%. </li><li>  Twitter: 64.4%. </li><li>  LinkedIn: 62.1%. </li><li>  YouTube: 48.4%. </li><li>  Amazon: 43.1%. </li><li>  Pinterest: 39%. </li><li>  Apple: 35.9%. </li><li>  Groupon: 30.8%. </li><li>  Netflix: 29.6%. </li></ol><br><h4>  Cutting off the extra: What should be an email message </h4><br>  In addition to statistics, you can understand how to create email messages with the help of a practical example.  Flow marketing expert Cameron Conaway <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/zen-art-email-design-cameron-conaway">shared</a> his experience in optimizing email text.  Service staff had to create a newsletter containing a link to the latest material from the blog for its subscribers. <br><br>  As the marketer writes, at first he wanted to add both the header and the sidebar to the email, but after a meeting with colleagues it was decided that one of the two would be enough.  This is how the first version of the letter looked like (the numbers mark the places that were later changed): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b44/fed/3bb/b44fed3bbe604102ad803fad1d37f246.png"><br><br><ol><li>  Needed a unique logo.  The image that was used in the first version of the letter personified the development of the startup, but was taken from the Shutterstock photobank, and this did not at all correspond to the creative direction in which the editorial board wanted to move. </li><li>  The phrase ‚Äúfrom the Flow company‚Äù at the end of the sentence ‚ÄúMaterial on how to create excellent teams from Flow company‚Äù seemed cumbersome and inappropriate.  In addition, it did not comply with the principle of simplicity, which the team tried to adhere to. </li><li>  At first, workers wanted to add an introductory construct before moving directly to the article, but in the end they decided that it would only overload the text of the letter. </li><li>  Having reduced the introductory structure, they decided that it was worth adding a hyperlink to it in order to immediately draw the reader‚Äôs attention to the article. </li><li>  It was also decided to get rid of the phrase "If you missed our first article."  This is another example of piling up, which only prevented the reader from bringing the main idea to the reader. </li><li>  For the same reason, the line ‚ÄúForward together‚Äù was deleted.  As planned, this little phrase carried a deep meaning, but for readers it was an additional hindrance. </li><li>  The blog's signature was replaced with the more general ‚ÄúTMT Edition‚Äù. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8df/cc3/ade/8dfcc3ade2094888be8e328863dd7a7f.png"><br><br>  With the help of the new version of the letter, the number of clicks on the links was increased more than twice with almost the same number of discoveries.  But it could still be optimized. <br><br><ol><li>  An unremarkable greeting began to seem redundant, so it was removed. </li><li>  The same could be said about the ‚ÄúPS‚Äù line, especially considering that readers followed the link indicated in it not too often. </li></ol><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e24/0a5/fbe/e240a5fbeeef432b90f1b8747ac5ad11.png"><br><br>  Conaway says that creating a letter was similar to the joint process of editing a poem: you had to get rid of everything that was superfluous, leaving behind the most important.  This is the only way to direct the attention of subscribers in the right direction. <br><br><h4>  Other materials about creating mailing lists in the <a href="http://pechkin-mail.ru/">Pechkin</a> blog: </h4><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pechkin/blog/277895/">How to create email-auto-answers: Analysis of 100 applications to support services of IT companies</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pechkin/blog/277259/">Why spam is so hard to beat</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pechkin/blog/275809/">How IT executives work with mail</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pechkin/blog/274667/">Selection: 115 useful mailing lists about technologies that you should subscribe to</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/pechkin/blog/273677/">Layout letters: 60 useful resources, guides and research</a> </li></ul></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/280510/">https://habr.com/ru/post/280510/</a></p>
