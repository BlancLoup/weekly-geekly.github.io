  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Private space for everyone, or a small personal piece of happiness</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This publication - reflections on the availability of space for everyone.  I think many who are at least sometimes interested in the topic of space, what's new, interesting.  Dreams, or conceals a desire to be in that very cosmos.  At least briefly, for a week.  To be the same astronaut, who so wanted to be in childhood.  Ideally, for people of our generation who venture on such a journey, they will land on nearby, or not very distant objects, such as the Moon and Mars.  Unless there is a revolutionary leap in the development of space technologies, or if they do not invent a ‚Äúsource of eternal youth,‚Äù this will remain the ultimate dream for people who have already crossed the threshold of 20 years.  Since longer journeys, for example, to Titan, or even more distant Pluto will take more than one year (or even a decade) and the existing technologies are simply not intended for the survival of people behind the asteroid belt. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5b8/b83/0e2/5b8b830e2e334b59bfec4f506034cda7.jpg" alt="View of the Pacific Ocean from Orbit"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  But people have a thirst for discovering new things, and it is she who is pushing companies such as Spase Exploration, Virgin Galactic, Planatery Resources, Deep Space Industries to invest in an industry that was previously considered purely public.  Like any business, they invest in order to make a profit in the future.  Yes, this is a more risky venture than, for example, the opening of a plant for the production of gadgets and equipment, but the risk is justified.  First, the forecasted profits of these enterprises will be transcendental from the moment technologies are run in, secondly, this is a strong impetus to human development.  And it was the latter that caused their creation, a certain altruism on behalf of the creators.  But we all know that the cosmos is an expensive hobby and, apart from the states, no one will agree to such altruism.  Space budgets, not hundreds of thousands of dollars, but millions and billions.  And the starting capital of these companies amounts to hundreds of millions of initial investments. <br><br>  But what about the mere mortals, whose capital does not have such amounts?  This question was attempted to answer Bass Landdorp with his project Mars One.  An ambitious idea, right?  Unfortunately, the project is doomed to failure in the form in which it is presented now.  I hope that they will reconsider their approaches and justify the confidence of those who have entrusted their savings and even their lives to them.  And eliminating the only loud project with a minimum start-up capital, we are left with nothing.  All other projects are either frozen or forgotten and have not been heard for a long time.  The only option left is to start doing everything yourself!  The idea is as ambitious as it is insane at first glance.  The main question is how?  The answer is simple - with the world on a thread.  The same principle as with the project of Landstrop with the main difference that it is necessary to take on small projects, to make a detailed assessment of the cost of the project, something besides beautiful words and a sketch of pictures from the video.  To approach the matter wisely, so as not to crumble under the pressure of the smallest and most constructive criticism.  And most importantly - bring them to self-sufficiency!  A simple approach in its principle, to raise money for something small, to realize it and continue to tackle more complicated things.

      For example, pick up a satellite with high resolution cameras on the GSO.  To transfer the received records to the Earth, to process them.  And that's all, you can distribute the finished video by subscription with the ability to see on the monitors a picture that is not available under other circumstances.  If a little more refine the project of the satellite, the video can be received in real time, as existing projects.  In addition, the received from it and processed into a convenient special content can be delivered to the planetarium.  And such a video can be watched in virtual reality glasses.  Space is close by without leaving your PC.  This idea is also supported by a good base for teaching children and everyone who is interested in the topic of astronomy.  The study of astronomical maps can be radically simplified.  All the necessary information will be in VR glasses with a clear illustration of the material being told.  This example is invented to describe the concept.  Every enthusiast is free to choose his niche, to argue the utility, the methods of monetization and the ways of their realization of the idea.  Thus, with a certain degree of success, the ideas fulfill several important requirements - they carry practical benefits and projects can be self-sustaining in order to enable the next more expensive and / or ambitious projects the right to life. <br><br>  I will give an example of small estimated calculations.  Suppose that the development of such a satellite would require 40k and another 80k for equipment in the satellite.  It will weigh about 50 kilograms (with the minimum amount of fuel on board), which at the current price for taking cargo to the GSO will cost about 600k.  Those.  The total cost of the project will be 720k dollars.  But this is quite a large and costly amount, the above-mentioned Mars One since the beginning of its existence through March 2015 was able to collect only $ 784,380 in donations.  So you need to look for ways to optimize costs.  And here comes the ISS.  That immediately frees you from two problems.  There is no need to put the engines and load the satellite with fuel to adjust the orbit.  The ISS will do everything.  And thus you can reduce the weight to 25 and the cost of the output of this satellite to 120k.  Thus, a ready-made satellite with an output to orbit will cost about 250k, which is equal to several apartments, or vehicles of average cost.  Those.  This project will be able to implement a medium-sized company.  And as a small result for this project, if a monthly subscription costs two dollars, then it will be necessary to sell a little more than one hundred thousand subscriptions without deducting taxes for its commercial viability. <br><br>  By the end, I would like to cite a few more projects with more detailed settlement calculations and other arguments whose estimated budget will not be exorbitant prices, but this will probably be left for the next publications. <br><br>  PS We would have been actively flying into space for a long time, finance the areas adjacent to the space program as the army states finance. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/366469/">https://habr.com/ru/post/366469/</a></p>
