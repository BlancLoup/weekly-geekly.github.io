Of course, to participate in its organization! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gm/us/kx/gmuskxj0zrtyrq9s5pkapvrsdyc.jpeg"><br><br>  The Mobius conference is held in St. Petersburg not the first year, and we have a tradition - every time to write a brief report on Habr about what happened.  Usually such reports are written by participants and speakers, but this time I will write it - as a leading interviewer.

      Under the cut there will be a brief chronicle of events with comments and photos.  Careful traffic: photos in relatively good quality. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  You can come to Mobius live or watch a broadcast on YouTube.  Those who came "live" may not even guess that there is one more show for viewers of the broadcast: in the intervals between the reports, we interview speakers, sponsors, the Program Committee and so on. <br><br>  From nine in the morning until the very close we live in the following rhythm: <br><br><ul><li>  We negotiate with the speakers about the interview; </li><li>  We look at half of the current report (how long is enough); </li><li>  We conduct an interview; </li><li>  Everything is repeated anew (by the number of slots in the program plus lunch). </li></ul><br>  Despite the fact that we also watch the reports - we are not typical participants.  One can see not so much a conference as its inside out.  You can watch as a huge conference machine unfolds.  Works exactly like a clock.  From the participants and speakers, you can learn things that no one usually says out loud. <br><br>  The reports that I looked at were chosen like this: <br><br><ul><li>  Architectural and educational reports (for example, on the Linux kernel) are more important than specialized ones; </li><li>  Android takes precedence over iOS (because in Android I understand a little, but in iOS, alas); </li><li>  Reports on topics requiring knowledge of the materiel (for example, A / B testing) require multiple revisions, so they have the lowest priority - they will need to be reviewed in the record, time after time, until you understand. </li></ul><br>  It is clear that this separation is purely subjective.  But it explains why further about some reports are written in detail, and some are not mentioned at all. <br><br><h1>  The first day </h1><br><img width="400" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b89/f65/6a3/b89f656a35c84820c17efd90071e2672.jpg">  In terms of interviews, the first day was conditionally ‚Äúthe day of iOS‚Äù.  Participated or speakers with reports about iOS, or the Program Committee.  Obviously, it‚Äôs impossible to do this without a cool iOS developer, so we conducted interviews with Stanislav Tsyganov from Tutu.ru.  Sometimes Ruslan Akhmetzyanov, marketing director at JUG.ru Group, helped us. <br clear="all">  The day, as always, began twice: first for the broadcast audience and then for all the others. <br><br>  The conference director Andrei Dmitriev and Denis Neklyudov, the author of one of the most popular reports, came to the opening of the online: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4t/hv/ay/4thvayfam8pim_q6tcaub61ifmi.png"><br><br>  Andrey had to be released quickly: together with Ivan Dolgov, he opens a conference in the main hall. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ep/rs/dl/eprsdlqtyoemfq3zu08ynkg5258.png"><br><br>  From the discovery, I remember the following exercise: you need to find a colleague next to you and communicate on any topic (preferably professional) for 30 seconds.  It was a resounding success ... and then I had to run away to negotiate with the sponsors in what order we would approach them at lunch with the film crew. <br><br><h1>  one </h1><br>  Next was Keynout with Felix Krause.  Keynout is not intended to be a super-hardcore report - it is something that sets the direction and spirit of the entire conference. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yt/-t/jc/yt-tjcgjsdgjsemldxlm7zkzx70.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, Felix asked the spirit!  Encouraged participants rushed from the hall.  Immediately after the keynote, an impressive crowd gathered in the discussion area of ‚Äã‚ÄãFelix.  Do not forget to enter the discussion areas - it can be more interesting there than on the report! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/r9/jk/az/r9jkazmjc5stniankbaluz37i74.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  2 </h1><br>  I, to put it mildly, have never been an iOS programmer, so I decided to choose something general educational.  And then there was a report about <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/mt2eecqokiosqguiooouu/">how to jump from RxJava to Kotlin</a> ! <br><br>  The topic itself is very holivore, and it was a separate pleasure to listen to the speaker‚Äôs reasoning and approach to the point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/82/wt/bs/82wtbszrmcrzoyvnxuzgfeorjpa.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  3 </h1><br>  The next slot could continue to <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/5scrjaz2ieoyw2ikwwawek/">get acquainted with Kotlin</a> , but in the name of erudition I had to choose something else.  Of the two remaining reports, the choice was fairly straightforward: testing can be viewed later in the recording, but the report on the <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/1drnrhowzy20scawmkwgyo/">transition to the platform JobScheduler</a> is a very relevant topic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vi/0g/uo/vi0guondonemz-ka0mvhaohqgv8.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  Dinner </h1><br>  Next was lunch, during which we communicated with sponsors and took small interviews for online broadcasting. <br><br>  The sponsors were very cool.  If it were not for the work, it would be worth hanging out there for the whole dinner, judge for yourself: CFT had all sorts of contests and prizes in the cool scenery: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yi/-k/wl/yi-kwlc5wdxid_r3y1ecezookji.jpeg"><br><br>  Mikhail Samarin told what to do if you want to go to Finland or Germany: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sx/eq/k8/sxeqk8n0039ed_56welvfzm9kne.jpeg"><br><br>  And so on and so forth.  I will not turn this habrapost into an advertisement of sponsors - judging by the crowds at the stands, they themselves have completely coped with the task :-) <br><br><h1>  four </h1><br>  The next slot had a tough choice between reports from Yandex, Odnoklassniki and EPAM.  After long mental agony I had to choose Yandex. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x1/4b/83/x14b83qxysq5trg5wp0kwthycw0.jpeg"><br><br>  The report on <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/7ydxrub4nucyauwkqgsysq/">‚Äúbirth, life and death‚Äù</a> turned out to be quite enlightening.  Anton is a team leader in Yandex.Avto, and somehow subconsciously think that a person who does such an important thing should definitely understand when and why the application dies.  Even in a simple car stereo it is impossible to afford that the application falls on level ground.  And he really understands.  It was even clearly told about the places where they usually say "and then some kind of magic" (especially this applies to the Linux kernel). <br><br><h1>  five </h1><br>  Again a tough choice!  I am familiar with Jonathan Levin and really wanted to go to his report.  On the other hand, in parallel with him was the report of Konrad Feiler with ‚ÄúHow to fit a million stars into an iPhone‚Äù, which was guaranteed to become a bomb. <br><br>  As always, I couldn‚Äôt get on the whole report, but I managed to hook both of them in pieces. <br><br>  Jonathan <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/k9oicatsmuuyieueia008/">burned about services</a> .  I suddenly realized how he, as a speaker, was different from all the others.  He does the show.  There is a suspicion that even if he comes on stage and starts telling jokes, even this will go down to everyone.  However, technically that small piece that I managed to catch was good. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/pb/6b/jo/pb6bjocxaoamkendav5x0nvasgo.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/ekhvjwdbxgmeseesw8osm/">Conrad did not lag behind</a> .  When someone begins to talk about new technologies, AI, how ships plow the expanses of the universe, immediately expect a story about wild smoothies and brakes.  Conrad, on the contrary, turned out to be a tough report in which from the very beginning we were dipped into the very guts. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/qd/yn/gf/qdyngf0ejwrikmr0-_wbprfyirq.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uc/yq/zh/ucyqzhbsylbifpcxmq_qab0mdqg.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  6 </h1><br>  Well, in the end something happened that I waited all day.  Breslav came and <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/4br9b0dlvy28ig6eymyeei/">told about Kotlin</a> .  Hearing about the language from the creator of the language - this is very cool, it is like a very religious person to communicate with his God in person. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vf/z5/jn/vfz5jnjmzypakpvxowt7qf7nnxu.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  Day One, BoF and Party Closing </h1><br>  Next with Stanislav Tsyganov and Egor Tolstoy, they traditionally closed the first day of the online broadcast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ex/m2/5a/exm25auqpctpnv-hxyr3cwjdcs4.png"><br><br>  After that there were bos.  This is something like a mini-meeting, a hobby group, in which there is no longer a division between ‚Äúspeakers‚Äù and ‚Äúparticipants‚Äù - everyone participates in the discussion on an equal basis.  This is especially pleasant, considering that there are a lot of people among the participants, no less steep than the speakers - they should also be given the opportunity to speak. <br><br>  Unfortunately, I didn‚Äôt get to bofs and the party, because I was completely exhausted.  On my smart watch, the counter has long gone over 25 thousand steps.  These steps were spent on searching and communicating with speakers for interviews.  Just crawled to the taxi, drove to the house and fell asleep. <br><br>  But there were cool photos.  Look: people do not go to the party, but continue to torment Breslav in the discussion area! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/dk/30/yj/dk30yjlee79p9nmo_lbjaks2afy.jpeg"><br><br>  GaGa.ru nastolochki and beer! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ff/tl/0g/fftl0gwmpuhiztwgkwm4eazeing.jpeg"><br><br>  This is what the Bafs look like: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/fy/-7/e9/fy-7e9ex8oci7golj6vmt0jrq20.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  Second day </h1><br>  During the night, my legs no longer hurt, and managed to force myself to arrive at the beginning of the conference in as little as an hour. <br><br><img width="400" align="left" src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c3/5ad/2ee/9c35ad2ee3daabd2af472af40d103006.jpg">  From the point of view of interviewing, the second day became ‚ÄúAndroid Day‚Äù, and a new superhero was needed to help.  He was Grigory Dzhanelidze from the Program Committee. <br clear="all"><h1>  one </h1><br>  The first choice was made simple: if there is Evgeny Suvorov in the track, go to it.  Yes, he is from the Program Committee.  Let's see how well PC members prepare <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/9tzgoqy9ziemomygog24u/">their own reports</a> :-) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/lk/ax/t3/lkaxt3cpre-hviohbtozgt-xrto.jpeg"><br><br>  What can I say, cook well.  By the way, try to guess on the slide what leafs the speaker is talking about. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/ju/cs/dsjucsqq-9kdknhr9h3uhtpro5o.png"><br><br><h1>  2 </h1><br>  Another report, selected by the principle: go to a familiar speaker.  Denis Neklyudov not only opened the online broadcast of this conference, but also came with his own story: <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/1bdqvp2ldic4gqey4kgeqc/">how not to grow old during the assembly</a> .  I think this topic touches the heart of any javista.  Results of refactoring in the length of a year.  For some people, it does not end in a lifetime. <br><br>  Just look at how many people have collected this report! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uu/af/h4/uuafh4-p0tuot7mfidt6pytcfd4.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sk/mi/7q/skmi7qoanyvjyaapovgbh_v9ejs.jpeg"><br><br>  In the discussion area, too, there was a full house, but we didn‚Äôt see him (because we had another interview): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/0l/hr/qx/0lhrqx8kt7banx0bybqavg5krqy.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  3 </h1><br>  We met Alexey Demedetsky at a speaker‚Äôs dinner the day before the conference.  We discussed data-driven UI, and Alexey threw a bunch of hooks in a conversation: come to the report and find out.  It was not possible to come fully, but to look in is yes. <br><br>  The report is called <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/v96lokugwe8cwggio8ois/">‚ÄúData-driven UI: unlimited power‚Äù</a> , and it‚Äôs interesting here that this is not some theory (which is full on the Internet, just drive in Google‚Äôs ‚Äúdata-driven UI‚Äù and see thousands of sofa analysts), but quite specific considerations that and how to do it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/if/7e/1s/if7e1svezbwbt8qao6kwnwofms4.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  four </h1><br>  <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/2of8r6nlvuy6ceeoykki2e/">‚ÄúAn introduction to AOSP, or How to spend the night on assembling Android‚Äù</a> is an excellent report that conveys the essence and spirit of OpenSource.  Viktor managed to work in his life in every possible enterprise, but now he is talking about AOSP.  ‚ÄúA very small number of people want to build Android itself, in addition to applications,‚Äù says Victor at the very beginning of the report.  ‚ÄúPeople may be afraid to start, or they don‚Äôt know where to start.‚Äù  And I did not even think that you need to do this.  It turns out - can and should be. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ug/ok/q1/ugokq1iuroq6myxwnpgnn_lh-8s.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  five </h1><br>  The latest non-keyout report.  Again there is a difficult choice between the EPAM microservice report, Avito releases and augmented reality in Yandex maps. <br><br>  I'd like to assume that we are not just doing some typical bytovuhoy, and High Technologies.  Therefore, reluctantly, I chose something similar to "high technology" - the report <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/3yyskpawy4yciyucw2oacq/">"Augmented Reality in Yandex.Maps</a> . <a href="https://mobiusconf.com/2018/spb/talks/3yyskpawy4yciyucw2oacq/">"</a>  Even among Android fans, only lazy people have not heard about ARKit, and in Yandex they made a full-fledged solution - pedestrian navigation with augmented reality. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/uw/wi/cq/uwwicqif383ihqx0t1gcfsgnfga.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yf/f4/xt/yff4xt7gcgzr2vok_jhqlllb1ua.jpeg"><br><br>  In addition, during the whole day we could at any time approach the Microsoft stand and look at augmented reality based on their technologies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/eb/3q/v1/eb3qv19rhiynpapd4ngxc99jkuw.jpeg"><br><br><h1>  6 </h1><br>  Finally, the final keyout.  Jonathan did his best and prepared something very special for us. <br><br>  This is not just a keyout, but a quiz.  And not just a quiz, but an epic battle! <br><br>  In the first phase, an online voting online was filmed, in which you can choose only one side.  And be sure to specify the real name. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/yn/6l/vf/yn6lvfpsdvj03jso00fr1eu5b8y.jpeg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xk/iw/ti/xkiwtio3rlpxmzcnfyvuc4do7xc.png"><br><br>  In the second phase, the winners were divided into two camps, dressed up in yellow, and the real game began :-) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/z5/hx/fc/z5hxfcbmkfcescjz0_oog94oo-o.png"><br><br>  Each team is asked a question and is given 30 seconds to answer.  If they didn‚Äôt meet, the opposite team may respond.  For each question is awarded one point.  At the end there were two super questions, for which 10 points were added already.  I, of course, will not tell them - whoever has a record will look. <br><br>  By the way, the audience could also participate and get a prize. <br><br>  By the end of the day, I began to fall asleep, and such a powerful keyout helped me to cheer up a bit and live to the end. <br><br><h1>  Closing </h1><br>  In the end, as always, there were two closings.  One thing is common, and one thing is closing the online broadcast. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gm/us/kx/gmuskxj0zrtyrq9s5pkapvrsdyc.jpeg"><br><br>  Software director Andrei Dmitriev, General Marketing of <a href="https://habr.com/users/arg89/" class="user_link">ARG89</a> JUG.ru Group Ruslan Akhmetzyanov and director of the JUG.ru Group Alexey Fedorov again came to us to close the online. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ln/up/vm/lnupvmhvxkpxbc_8awatrpmn3yo.png"><br><br><h1>  Conclusion </h1><br>  Probably the last thing worth noting is that Mobius has grown a lot, more than 40% compared to last year.  And now we are trying to figure it out: has the conference been so much better than the previous ones, or has mobile development finally reached adult technical conferences? <br><br>  The next Mobius will be held December 8-9 in Moscow (yes, Moscow is now also for two days!). <br><br>  PS: And as my personal achievement, I am very proud that I lived to the end without the help of <a href="https://habr.com/users/phillennium/" class="user_link">phillennium</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/358372/">https://habr.com/ru/post/358372/</a></p>
