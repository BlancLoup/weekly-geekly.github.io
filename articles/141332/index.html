    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Given: </h4><br>  Let's start from the thought that Habr and TechCrunch projects are unidirectional, which means they can be compared.  TechCrunch is cited in <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/search/%3Fq%3Dtechcrunch">325 topics</a> on Habr√©, which hints.  Although there are a couple of important differences.  First, TechCrunch is highly specialized and covers only startups and ventures.  Secondly, only <a href="http://techcrunch.com/about/">TechCrunch Staff</a> of 33 people has access to the publication. <br><br>  Despite its narrow specialization, TechCrunch covers a much larger geographic audience.  As for traffic, according to their <a href="http://techcrunch.com/advertise/">own statements</a> , the monthly audience is more than 13M, for which they have assigned the status of <b># 1 Tech Audience Online</b> .  And how much, by the way, does Habr have?  In addition, TechCrunch boasts 8 Page Rank vs. 6 from Habr, and this indicates high quoting. <br><br><h4>  How to publish a review on TechCrunch </h4><br>  As everyone knows, any startup dreams of TechCrunch.  We also dreamed, working purposefully in this direction for a couple of months. <br><br>  Rumors about the consequences of such a publication go different.  Someone is talking about 200K unique visits (which, by the way, was readily believed after the fine effect).  Someone about high investor interest in everything that is mentioned on TechCrunch.  But in general, there was a feeling that having reached this goal, we will abruptly change the fate of the project.  Therefore, we did everything necessary to be noted there, and this is what is needed: <br><br>  <b>1. Startup</b> <br>  It would seem trite, but: <br><ul><li>  Your project should be online, i.e.  already work and have a real audience.  Ideas or prototypes are definitely not suitable. </li><li>  Everything should be in English (although there may be local offices that I do not know about). </li><li>  Ideally, you should have an original idea or at least a clone that is not inferior to a leading quality competitor. </li></ul><br>  <b>2. PR agency and money</b> <br>  Even if you have a working project with an original idea, no one will offer to write about it.  Attempts to ‚Äúget‚Äù TechCrunch authors via social networks are perceived as spam and are hardly ever considered.  In any case, it did not work for us.  Although I do not exclude the possibility that one of the authors accidentally presses on the link sent by you and inspires the article. <br><br>  Contact the authors tehkrancha should a person whom they trust, and even better know personally.  In our case, this person turned out to be an employee of a <a href="http://sspr.com/">PR agency</a> that we turned to.  The services of such offices cost from 3 to $ 5K per month, but they know their work and usually give a predictable result. <br><br>  Participation in incubators such as Y-combinator may be a cheaper option to attract attention and even get a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/140911/">copy-paste on Habr√©</a> .  We have not tried. <br><br>  <b>3. Exclusive release</b> <br>  TechCrunch does not write about what was written before them.  If you have spotted your new feature / idea on other blogs, you will most likely be denied.  The text of the article and the functionality described in it is agreed a few days before publication.  After that, designate the day and time of release of the article, the release should take place exactly at this time.  Any other press releases can be issued no earlier than 30 minutes after TechCrunch writes about it.  Therefore, if you have prepared interesting features, do not rush to show them to the public before agreeing on the time of publication of the article. <br><br>  <b>4. Time</b> <br>  Do not try to plan the release date of the article.  The process may take several months, especially if you add time to search for a PR agency and negotiate with them.  In our case, it took about two months.  But even when everything was coordinated by the author of the techcranch named <b>Anthony Ha</b> just forgot about it. <br><br><img src="http://crunchbase.com/assets/images/resized/0016/9973/169973v1-max-250x250.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  TechCrunch effect vs Habroeffect </h4><br>  We look at the raw results: <br><br>  Habroeffect after the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/132549/">publication</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2b2/539/02c/2b253902c225c2e8dfb3ebbf7b9efde2.png" alt="image"><br><br>  TechCrunch effect after <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2012/02/24/tradingview-european-watch-list/">posting</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ad3/9c0/f4c/ad39c0f4c593fdf45d1366165bb1728a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Both are pure results, i.e.  excluding conversions from other referrals.  Here is a summary graph for all referrals to take into account the rss readers and other places where TechCrunch can search <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ceb/04a/3aa/ceb04a3aae1a060fc57c4c08748cb92b.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Number of comments and votes on Habr√© <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9a0/21c/288/9a021c288824ef2d9a8fc34f61102934.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The number of sharingov and comments on TechCrunch <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/055/560/dd3/055560dd3ef2454c534cb9ce3acbbe81.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  Publishing to Techcrunch is useful, but it will not change the fate of your project.  Consider this as an important part of the marketing plan, but not the goal itself.  Techcrunch does not provide the traffic that many expect from it.  For example, in our case, this is 100 times less than what we had hoped for sincerely :) Habr, on the other hand, exceeded our expectations - especially considering the quantity and quality of comments. <br><br>  After the article on Habr√©, we received several interesting partnership offers, one of which was a prerequisite for long-term cooperation.  After publishing on Techcrunch, our technology began to use several large financial portals ( <a href="http://wallstwatchdog.com/company%3Fsymbol%3DT">pruflink</a> ). <br><br>  It is worth noting that the publication on Techcrunch was on Friday, because the author forgot to make it on Thursday.  Theoretically, this could affect traffic.  The text on Techcrunch is frankly weak and does not reveal the main advantages of the project.  Post on Habr√© from the sandbox and fell into the section I am Piercing, which probably also did not add popularity. <br><br><h4>  What else? </h4><br>  It will be correct to evaluate and compare not only the quantity, but also the quality of the traffic.  To do this, you need to see what percentage of the audience has become our regular user or started accounts.  I don‚Äôt want to do this now, so as not to inflate the article.  In addition, too much time elapsed between publications, and this may give a large error. <br><br>  But this Thursday we should have a big release in which there will be many interesting things for fans of both American and Russian markets.  For US stocks, we begin to distribute fundamental data for free - over 100 fields in total.  For Russian traders, we added support for the MICEX (MICEX) exchange in real time. <br><br>  The release overview is coordinated with Techcrunch, at the same time we can post an interesting topic on Habr.  And according to the results of the experiment to publish the results.  Vote for this topic if you're interested.  In the comments, we will answer any questions on the topic in detail. <br><br>  Thank. <br><habracut></habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141332/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141332/</a></p>
