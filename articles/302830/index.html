  <section class="page js-page"><h1>12 unwritten design rules</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  From the theory of grids to the Golden Section, there is a set of basic principles that have been passed down from generation to generation by designers.  Every good designer knows these rules, they are described in books, told in courses and in higher educational institutions.  But on a par with the written, designers still have unwritten rules.  And unfortunately, many of us learn about it only from our own bitter experience.  But it is not at all necessary to learn from your mistakes, especially when there are strangers. <br><br>  The post contains simple but useful tips from leading designers who kindly agreed to share their personal experiences.  So, we will begin to improve their own professional skills. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f8/bd8/0e5/1f8bd80e57d045d7aae58825bd0bdd46.jpg">

    <h4>  1. Find out what your client really wants. </h4><br>  The discussion stage is one of the most important.  Never skimp on questions, pull as much information out of the client.  You have to dig deeper, almost climb into the customer's brain and make the most correct picture of what he wants.  Thus, there will be more chances to avoid endless edits. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/542/2e7/6fa/5422e76fa4ad453a80f0736137a27d38.jpg"><br><br>  Force24 art director John Stanyon: <br><blockquote>  A question on the agenda - what does the client really need?  The technical task is often a ‚Äúdesign solution‚Äù of the client, and not a problem that he wants to solve. </blockquote><br>  Despite the personal interest in obtaining a quality product, customers, as a rule, will not tell you what they really want.  They may hint, suggest or suggest certain options.  But in most cases, the designer has to literally ‚Äúread‚Äù thoughts. <br><br>  Examples of what customers want: <br><br>  <b>Know that the process is worth it.</b>  Customers are worried about their money and want to be sure that investing in a design will pay for itself (especially if they are not aware of the prices in the design market).  It is worth listing and explaining everything point by point, what will be done and how much it costs (and also why it costs so much).  It is important that the client does not have the impression that he is simply being fooled and ‚Äúdiluted‚Äù with money. <br><br>  <b>Know that their ideas are listened to.</b>  Many clients like to feel themselves as participants in the creative process, and not just to make TK and wait for the final result.  And it can be quite exciting and even useful for a designer.  In addition, if costs suddenly increase or the project‚Äôs due date moves, it will be easier for customers to explain the reasons. <br><br>  <b>See something really brilliant.</b>  It is clear that every self-respecting client wants to see a brilliant design.  But he also expects the designer to have patience, understanding, and professionalism, even after numerous tiny and painstaking edits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b46/5b2/cf2/b465b2cf2d8046519692169e344cd45d.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Deliver your vision.</b>  A real understanding of the wishes of the client is formed over time.  We are talking about the implementation of TZ in such a way as to satisfy these wishes and at the same time create a high-quality design. <br><br>  <b>Get the best solution.</b>  Designers are hired for competence in this area.  Accordingly, the client must trust your professionalism.  Therefore, collecting information on the TZ and starting to fulfill the order, remember that the expert here is all the same and you ultimately provide high-quality design taking into account trends and years of experience. <br><br><h4>  2. The customer is right, even if it is not. </h4><br>  Who do you work for?  Right on the client.  And he knows his own business better than others, he knows most about him. <br><br>  As Adam Morris, the lead designer at Made By Many, says: <br><blockquote>  Leave your ego behind the door.  The customer is the ultimate judge of whether your design is successful. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee4/6a3/8d0/ee46a38d04614b8fa1fc3c59bd107b37.jpg"><br><br>  Stickyeyes senior digital designer Graham McDonnell (Graham McDonnell) adds: <br><blockquote>  Design is always a subjective vision and although you may know everything about the latest design trends, understand the intricacies of development, have impeccable taste, as a rule, the client knows your audience better. </blockquote><br><h4>  3. Agree on the results in the first stages. </h4><br>  RPM Creative Head Ben Woolf advises: <br><blockquote>  Negotiate each stage of the order in advance.  As if the obvious thing, and yet many projects began without phased approvals. </blockquote><br>  It is necessary to heed the advice of Wolfe to avoid problems in the future.  The client needs to approve each design development stage - this will protect the designer from unnecessary edits and complaints about the completion of the work.  And the finished design does not come as a surprise to the customer. <br><br><h4>  4. First - pen and paper </h4><br>  When creating a design can not do without a normal pen or pencil and a sheet of paper. <br><br>  According to Lewis designer Michael Ibrahim Heins (Michael Ibrahim Heins): <br><blockquote>  Pen and paper help to focus your mind on content, to get rid of unnecessary thoughts and not to be distracted.  The thought begins to stand out on paper, leaving aside the worries about which one is better to choose the font and how big the menu column should be. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e1c/f4e/6ac/e1cf4e6ac1ba420c873406f7dd6bc276.png"><br><br>  Many creative people agree that sometimes computers are driven into a certain framework, instead of giving vent to the imagination. <br><br>  Fitch Design Director Ed Bolton: <br><blockquote>  Computers limit vision to what they already have, without showing what else can be created. </blockquote><br><h4>  5. "Morning is wiser in the evening" </h4><br>  This rule is unwritten because it corresponds to common sense.  But sometimes we successfully forget about him ... <br><br>  UX Designer at Foolproof by Rob Sterry (Rob Sterry) believes that: <br><blockquote>  Taking a break from work, taking a break from design, and then appreciating it with a fresh look is like seeing your design for the first time.  And if the purity, then ‚Äúsleep‚Äù with the design even better. </blockquote><br><h4>  6. Starting first is normal. </h4><br>  I think every designer at least once had a moment when the conceived concept rested on some detail and the process stopped.  Or the implementation of the design was not as good as in the plans.  So, sometimes it is better, and even it is necessary to start all over again. <br><br>  For example, onebite creative director Martin Wells (Martin Wells) advises not to rest on one idea, and in this case, to go round, trying to do everything differently. <br><br>  And the main creative director of advertising agency DigitasLBi, Chris Clarke (Chris Clarke) offers a more philosophical point of view: <br>  "There is always not enough time to do something, but it is enough to make it all over again." <br><br><h4>  7. Test your design </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/540/c20/16f/540c2016fff1416cb20d418e0aa345d5.jpg"><br><br>  Web designers know from personal experience that pages need to be tested on multiple platforms.  And this rule also applies to graphic design. <br><br>  According to Adrien Raphoz, the leading creative designer of FCBInferno: <br><blockquote>  If your logo design does not work in a black and white 2x2 cm format, this is a messy design.  The design should work in various multimedia, so you need to check how it looks on print, in web browsers and on mobile devices. </blockquote><br><h4>  8. Stay on time </h4><br>  In the creative business is especially important to understand when it is worth stopping.  But then, because the flight of fancy has almost no limits. <br><br>  As FindMeaGift freelance designer Rob O'Neill thinks: <br><blockquote>  If you have actually completed the project, but are wondering whether to add a few more strokes, this is a sign that it‚Äôs time to stop. </blockquote><br>  Design Director Lewis Scott Walker (Scott Walker) supports the statement of O'Neill, urging that the last stage of the process will not be adding, but rather removing extra items from the layout. <br><blockquote>  When you think that you have finished the project - feel free to remove all unnecessary and as a result get a clean and improved work. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/21a/c41/e92/21ac41e92f6447bcb67f46710be319bd.gif"><br><br><h4>  9. Work in stages </h4><br>  Freelance designer Joe Whitaker (Joe Whitaker) shares his thoughts: <br><blockquote>  Work in stages is a great way to stay organized and have the opportunity to review the whole process of creating a project. </blockquote><br>  Using this practice can help in creating a project.  It provides an opportunity to track the process of work, the gradual implementation of the plan.  In addition, there will be an understanding of how long it takes to perform certain tasks. <br><br><h4>  10. Learn to accept criticism. </h4><br>  Professional designers work with different clients.  And it can be people who understand little in design (or even have no taste at all).  But they pay you money and sometimes they will say that the work done is not entirely satisfactory to them, the design is not like that, etc.  etc ... Do not take such criticism to heart. <br><br>  Fitch Design Director Ed Bolton: <br><blockquote>  Criticism is an unpleasant and difficult part of the designer‚Äôs work.  Especially when you put all your energy and soul into your project and are proud of the result.  But on the other hand, without constructive criticism there will be no improvements ... </blockquote><br><h4>  11. Read the terms of reference carefully. </h4><br>  Advice from Steven Scott: <br><blockquote>  It's simple - always carefully read the test task.  Read it once to familiarize yourself and understand what it is about.  Then read the second time to highlight key points.  It is amazing how many designers ignore TK, fully relying on an oral dialogue with the client. </blockquote><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c65/bdc/76a/c65bdc76af814e8e83ec957a3ae05efc.png"><br><br><h4>  12. Take an advance </h4><br><blockquote>  And the final tip will be from Tonik commercial director Joe Morris: <br>  Take the money in advance.  It may seem tough and straightforward, but in our time of a market economy you should have at least some financial guarantees.  An advance payment (a percentage of the payment) shows that your client is serious and ready to take on contractual obligations. </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/302830/">https://habr.com/ru/post/302830/</a></p>
