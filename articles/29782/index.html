  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In contrast to the design communities</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most likely, I have incorrectly identified for myself the tasks that are being solved by different design communities - in particular, the communities in LiveJournal.  In them, people solve their small everyday work questions, which sometimes even get sane answers.  But I would not risk calling any post in these communities inspiring.  That is, if you need to ‚Äúlook through‚Äù other people's work or read someone‚Äôs thoughts in order to find the starting point in your creative search, the communities are not suitable for this. <br><br>  So, I am with a calm heart otfrendil all these groups and streamlined bookmarks on designer blogs - so here you can get a lot of useful information for a creative person (or applying for one).  To whom it is interesting, I can share with the best links from my collection.  I would be grateful if in the comments habrasoosedi share their bookmarks for fruitful learning :) <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/" title="Open in new window">Smashing magazine</a></strong> <br>  <strong>Web design and all related topics.</strong>  Styles of sites, stylistic selections of examples of design, web technologies and their application in practice (although this is not as deep as on Habr√©).  Very nice blog - both in terms of topics and in the form of information submission.  Yes, and visually looks nice - easy to read and relaxed. <br>  <strong><a href="http://designcollector.ru/" title="Open in new window">Designcollector</a></strong> <br>  <strong>Catalog of references to the designer and photo resources</strong> - portfolio, blogs and other.  Much attention is paid to the work of graduates of prestigious design universities in Europe and America.  But homegrown aesthetes are not forgotten - there will definitely be links to the portfolio of photographers and designers from the post-Soviet space.  It also posted announcements of contests, seminars and other events of interest to designers and their "sympathizers." <br>  <strong><a href="http://inspiredology.com/" title="Open in new window">Inspiredology</a></strong> <br>  <strong>The ‚Äúrelative‚Äù of Smashing Magazine, but only in the sense of design</strong> - web technologies, as I understand it, are not considered here.  Genre collections of designs, examples of works in various styles can also serve as a good source of inspiration. <br>  <strong><a href="http://www.designingthenews.com/" title="Open in new window">Designing The News</a></strong> <br>  <strong>Visual experiments with a diverse presentation of news information.</strong>  The source for this blog is the Guardian newspaper.  Walking through the blog, I came to the conclusion that here the ideas for infographics are not metric - at least green to me :) <br>  <strong><a href="http://www.yankodesign.com/" title="Open in new window">Yanko design</a></strong> <br>  <strong>Industrial design in all its manifestations</strong> - from interiors to sports shoes, from cars to architectural concepts. <br>  <strong><a href="http://www.aisleone.net/" title="Open in new window">Aisleone</a></strong> <br>  <strong>Typography - examples of work.</strong>  There are some very interesting work, but the replenishment of the blog is rather sluggish. <br> <strong><a href="http://www.omami.ru/" title="Open in new window"><br></a></strong>  <strong><a href="http://www.omami.ru/" title="Open in new window">omami.ru</a></strong> <br>  <strong>Pretty famous in runet design blog.</strong>  If I have not forgotten anything, nothing is said about web design there - basically it is an industrial design with irregular patches of typography.  An interesting style of writing posts, quite funny work, which pays attention to the hostess of the blog.  However, recently the resource has somehow become sluggishly maintained - we will write it off for the summer and the desire to go somewhere far away from the computer and the Internet :) <br>  <strong><a href="http://www.notcot.org/" title="Open in new window">NOTCOT.ORG</a></strong> <br>  <strong>In the literal sense, there is a dump of design ideas</strong> :) Here you will find printing, typography, video advertising, industrial design, interior design, and everything else.  The guys who fill this directory of links literally gush forth - up to hundreds of new entries can accumulate in a day.  But this, as for me, is also a minus of the resource, given that the incoming information can not be filtered out.  And to read a long list of new links in the RSS feed personally breaks me :) <br>  <strong><a href="http://www.visualstyle.ru/" title="Open in new window">visualstyle.ru</a></strong> <br>  <strong>Infodesign and visual communications</strong> - in Russian.  The only thing that does not please - sluggish filling.  Sometimes posts are posted that are weakly linked to the blog topic.  The rest is quite a useful resource - I rarely see links from it to other resources I know.

Collects amazing work, but does not break long tapes into shorter pages and does not publish RSS feeds at all.  Therefore, at the end of each month, the collected list of illustrations may well slow down when scrolling - in the same Safari, for example. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/29782/">https://habr.com/ru/post/29782/</a></p>
