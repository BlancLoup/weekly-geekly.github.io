However, as it usually happens, people either get headsets for reviews, get paid, or people are not ready to quarrel with a company that gives equipment for review, but for some reason superlatives prevail in all reviews with almost no negative sides .

      Since I purchased the headset for my hard-earned money, the review will be in the vein of ‚Äúwhat do you actually get for two thousand rubles‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  So, in order: </h5><br><h4>  Packaging </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/10f/c7b/fde/10fc7bfde5027d72f9fb98362cc39801.jpg" alt="picture from http://www.voipblog.ru/2010/11/30/plantronics_backbeat_903_plus/" align="left"><br>  A good, sturdy plastic box in the form of a flattened cylinder, in which the headset itself is visible in all its factory beauty, and additional things are hidden behind a decorated cardboard with a name. <br>  The rigidity of the package allows us to confidently assert that when ordering from abroad, the tsatska will arrive without damage, unless in one container with the headset the anvil is transported. <br><br><h4>  Completeness </h4><br>  In addition to the headset itself, the kit includes instructions, a charger for a headset with two nozzles for European and English sockets, as well as a cover with a zipper for storing the headset in a bag / pocket.  Replaceable gum on the headset is not.  It is assumed that all humans have the same ears, although I would prefer an increase in the price for a couple of dollars and I would like to get a couple more options for inserts.  It is generally strange that there are no insulating liners.  It would be very helpful. <br><br><h4>  Ergonomics </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f9a/ab7/31e/f9aab731e143a1c238bbab1cd49e5100.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  The headset sits on the ears well, and at first almost does not feel.  For great people, there is a vertical adjustment of the position of the speakers relative to the ear part of the headset.  In the ears gum is not fixed, they are simply laid in the auricle and sound in the direction of the bell gum.  Therefore, people who are sensitive to foreign objects in the auricle will most likely appreciate the headset positively, since there is no irritating pressure on the inside of the ear either from the outside or from the inside.  However, after an hour of continuous wear, I had an almost painful desire to remove the headset and rest my ears.  I didn‚Äôt have such symptoms with any other earbud headphones. <br><br>  The angle of the position of the socket of the rubber pads on the speakers of the headset is regulated approximately in the region of 25 ¬∞, so that it is possible to adjust the direction of the sound in order to bring it into maximum correspondence with your ears. <br><br>  The main controls are located on the outer ends of the speakers: the play / pause player is on the right ear, and the answer / hang up / voice dial call is on the left. <br><br>  Managing the tracks of the player and the volume of the headset itself is located on the left behind the ear, and it seemed quite inconvenient to me to use them.  Despite the bulge of the buttons from the casing of the ear part, anyway, for my fingers sighted in both human eyes, the information content of these protrusions was not very intelligible.  In addition, it is necessary to apply approximately three times more effort to press these buttons than for the end ones.  By the way, the end buttons are very readily pressed even with a simple attempt to fix the headset in the ear. <br><br>  Sock with glasses is possible, but with reservations.  I have sports glasses with thick plastic arms and a ‚Äúsport-style‚Äù Police with flattened arms.  The arms of the sports glasses are made in such a way as to minimize contact with the head, so they "bulge out".  With them, the headset is generally unrealistic to wear, because the ears are bulging and the dynamics of the headset fall out of the ear.  With Police, who ‚Äúhug‚Äù half of the face, is quite comfortable.  Nevertheless, to really sporty headphones like the <a href="">Sennheiser PMX 70 Sport</a> headphones, with which any glasses are worn normally, this headset, like from pole to China, is a bell dance.  But, in fairness, it should be noted that Plantronics has a rear headband - just a wire and there is no need to talk about any kind of rigidity, the headset just hangs on the ears, so everything is quite predictable. <br><br>  The quality of sound reception from a mobile phone drives me into melancholy.  So I have some special magnetic field, the ribs are made of iron, and mercury is splashing in the vessels, but when the phone is in the pants pocket at a distance of exactly 1 meter from the headset, the sound is regularly interrupted.  There is no talk of any promised 15 meters maximum receiving distance.  15 meters, I think, are possible in some deep mine in a vacuum and a spherical horse should be dressed in the headset.  Because, leaving the phone on the table, I could not listen to music on the balcony exactly 4 meters from the phone due to constant interruptions. <br><br><h4>  Music </h4><br><img src="http://www.dualsim.ro/assets/own/Plantronics-BackBeat-903+_bluetooth_stereo_c.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><br>  When the reception is normal, this headset plays music perfectly.  At least in my unpretentious rumor.  I did not notice any deterioration in sound compared to the wired <a href="">Sennheiser CX300</a> .  I would even venture to suggest that the bass of this headset pumps better, despite the fact that it is not fixed at all in the ear.  But that may be the effect of the insane sound output module of HTC Sensation, or I just find fault.  At least I did not notice the difference in the sound of either <a href="http://prostopleer.com/search%3Fq%3DMassive%2BAttack%2B%25E2%2580%2594%2BParadise%2BCircus%2B(Zeds%2BDead%2BRemix)">Paradise Circus (Zeds Dead Remix)</a> or <a href="http://prostopleer.com/search%3Fq%3DShpongle%2B%25E2%2580%2594%2BDorset%2BPerception">Dorset Perception</a> . <br><br><h4>  Vote </h4><br>  This is not something to complain about, this is the transmission of voice.  The subscriber heard me quite well even in the subway, despite the fact that you can go deaf in the Moscow subway, and it‚Äôs not realistic to speak on the phone at all.  I read somewhere (unfortunately, I don‚Äôt remember where) that the plantronic in the headsets has some kind of patented noise reduction system.  I will not lie that she is in this headset - I do not know, but the fact is - the person heard me and even understood what I was saying. <br><br><h4>  Soundproofing </h4><br>  At the same time, I didn‚Äôt hear the caller, because the headset is not insulating and it skips the sounds outside without any muting.  For use in the subway headset does not fit perfectly, because  it doesn‚Äôt make any difference at all whether she is wearing you or not - deaf anyway. <br><br><h4>  Volume </h4><br>  Completely on the level.  I have enough.  The maximum volume is enough to hear music even in the subway. <br><br><h4>  Total </h4><br>  + High-quality reproduction <br>  + Good voice <br>  + Light, do not fall down while running <br><br>  - Zero soundproofing <br>  - Manage sound and tracks lousy <br>  - At first, the ears suffer from a headset if worn for a long time <br><br>  = The price tag of 70 bucks is ambiguous, but acceptable. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  For me, this headset definitely would not fit, because every day I ride the subway and one of the key characteristics of the headphones for me is to protect my ears from morons who can not weld the rails for half a century. <br><br>  Why this headset fits almost perfectly: <br>  For running, for cycling, for rocking.  You hear the music, but if you start screaming / beeping, then you will hear it without any problems. <br><br>  I believe that for driving in a car, it will also fit in as a hands-free, since it does not have soundproofing properties and does not interfere with the control of the situation. <br><br>  Definitely not suitable for those who prefer insulating headphones, because  This headset provides no isolation whatsoever. <br><br>  ¬©: Photos with a man and the title - Plantronics.
