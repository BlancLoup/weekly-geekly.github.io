      First, the localization of mobile applications has its own characteristics.  Large hardcore projects are usually translated by the publisher, for example, from English / Korean into Russian.  The "phone games" have a different fate.  They need to attract the attention of as many users around the world as possible, so from the basic Russian or English, on the contrary, it is beneficial to localize them to the maximum number of languages. <br><br>  And here the developers are faced with the expected obstacle - very few people are free to read and edit texts in ten to twelve languages.  And even if it can, this person rightly evaluates his qualifications worth his weight in gold.  You can search for such a specialist for a long time, and this hunt will be bloody. <br><br>  The second reason is the priority of the code over the text.  It is logical that usability, monetization and graphics are put at the forefront.  In the end, the user comes into the game not to read!  Yes, these letters and no one will pay attention!  (Take a candy if you are a developer, and such thoughts never occurred to you - it means that you are in fact an exception to the rules). <br><br>  Many fall into this trap - tasks for preparing localization and testing it are often postponed to the very last moment. <br><br>  As a result, it is not uncommon for users to notice the text, because it is full of errors, inaccuracies and blunders.  Meet on clothes, escorted by the mind.  Localization and graphics - this is the very clothes.  The user may simply not appreciate the excellent game mechanics, if at the entrance to the application will see a cheerful "Hello, gozt!". <br><br>  If he is unfortunate by accident Grammar-Nazi, then just turn around and leave.  If not, switch to the basic English locale and join the ranks of those who spit poison in the direction of translators with hands growing from the lower regions. <br><br>  How to ensure that localization does not just fit the application, but also sits on it like a glove? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  5 tips </h4><br>  Tips may seem simple - they are. <br><br>  1. First was the word.  <b>Unification of all gaming terminology</b> .  In the text everywhere the same terms should be used to describe the same processes, characters, features.  If the application has a shop called "Shop", then under this designation it should appear everywhere.  Here and help out the glossaries.  It is better to prepare them together with developers who will help the translator with comments and explanations. <br><br>  2. Native speakers!  <b>Let the translation do</b> - or at least read!  - <b>native speaker</b> .  Of course, this item is not absolute.  The choice between a certified translator from Russian to Italian and an Italian accidentally encountered on the Internet is obvious.  But it is necessary to recognize that a live, good and tasty translation into a certain language in most cases will be better for the media.  Take the time. <br><br>  3. <b>Proofreading.</b>  <b>Twice.</b>  <b>And better three</b> .  No seriously.  In this case, quantity affects quality.  A well-known fact - even the most competent author with a fresh mind can find places in his text that should be corrected and edited.  The same situation with translators.  Do not grab the translated text immediately, find an opportunity to send it for re-check.  The ideal option is when the native speaker translates and reads the locale. <br><br>  4. Let me play.  And the truth is - <b>let the translators play</b> .  And if they suddenly do not have the right device, send them screenshots of all game interfaces.  It often happens that the translator did his job perfectly, and the users, at the sight of some game phrase, put their eyebrows in the house and twist a finger at their heads.  Do not rush to scold the performer, remember that one word can have several meanings.  If the translator worked without knowing the context, the error is very likely.  Reinsure yourself - let him look at the text already integrated into the application.  He may have planted straws. <br><br>  5. Test, test, test.  And localization, and not ‚Äúguys, well, you look at the functional, and then if you suddenly find something on locales ...‚Äù <b>Let testers check, sit down and read</b> .  Is the text right?  Are there phrases that do not fit into the interface box?  Do all variables look like human beings, and not in the style of ‚Äú1 chip to receive‚Äù?  This is your cake - it's a shame to spend the day making it, and then ruin everything by decorating the treat with rotten cherries. <br><br>  These five simple rules of miracles do not create.  They will simply make the user ‚Äúnot stumble‚Äù about the text and fully manage to enjoy ‚Äúgreat graphics, an intuitive interface and exciting gameplay.‚Äù <br><br>  PS The reader will make a comment that the indie developer cannot always afford such a set of services - and he will be right.  Outside the list is a simple tip: work with your audience, guided by the ideas of customer development.  In the end, there may well be a linguist with experience among your fans. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a90/05b/48a/a9005b48a296055fd72263f2470aa530.jpg"><br>  <i>Worry your user!</i>  <i>If he is "your" - will certainly help!</i> <br><br><h4>  useful links </h4><br>  In previous materials we made it a rule to give a list of useful links on the topic.
