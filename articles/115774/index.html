  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Awad - buying AnyWayAnyDay air tickets on iPhone</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  It all started last year, when, as an employee of the company that made AnyWayAnyDay, I wanted to write a client for her under the iPhone. <br>  It seemed to me (it seems so now) that buying an airline ticket, being at a boring meeting, or lying on a chaise lounge and sipping a cool cocktail in the shade of one of the palm trees is cool!  Especially at a time when there is no computer at hand, and not smart gprs is considered luck. <br>  The authorities at first did not quite share my views.  They can be understood: things were going well, from iOs developers - I am alone (and there were tasks and more important), and most importantly - how to make the service, which after its appearance caused a stable wow effect on a small iPhone screen, did not look like a mockery of its senior brother <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The task seemed difficult, and my programmer skills were clearly not enough to come up with a beautiful and user-friendly interface to the written engine.  So, perhaps, everything would have been forgotten, if in one of the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/ui/85984">Habratopic</a> I was not acquainted with <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/fearout/" class="user_link">fearout</a> .  This was a great impetus, because what he drew on everyone liked it so much that it became clear that the application was there! <br>  Then I spent a lot of months, during which I had to understand a lot of questions and the subtleties of programming in objective c, I had my own experience, I changed jobs and the development slowed down and accelerated again - but it didn‚Äôt stand still, and now ... <br><br>  And now, today you can <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/awad/id424980622%3Fmt%3D8">download</a> the Awad application from the AppStore, and evaluate the result. <br><br>  Despite the limited screen size, when searching, you can set up to four flight segments, specify the class of service and other flight parameters: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a096263a/aed67ec4/f1792017/204202bc.jpg">

      In the meantime, there is a search, so as not to be bored, you can fly an airplane using an accelerometer :) <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/4d17f6cf/254704ec/5ef9d412/87e5030e.jpg"><br><br>  All offers found (and they are usually quite a lot) are grouped by airline and sorted by price (and, of course, you can set the currency in the settings): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/a224ea0f/1790ec1f/af5a5940/c24014d7.jpg"><br>  Here you can filter the results by convenient time of departure or arrival, airports and the number of transfers. <br>  Already from this screen you can see which company can offer direct flights, and where they are inevitable. <br><br>  Choosing a specific flight, the user is offered all the information that may be required to make a decision, or a brief view of it: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/d7170c1f/9dcff1bc/da49e42d/e4b1464c.jpg"><br><br>  Once you have decided, the program will once again make sure that such an offer really exists (all of a sudden, while you were choosing, someone bought the last ticket): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/748298fc/f1706774/eb3606f1/9b8a030a.jpg"><br>  And, after confirmation, all you have to do is enter your credit card details (a secure https connection is used for transmission) and go to the airport!  :) <br><br>  The program is able to memorize all the purchased tickets, and allows you to refresh the data at any time: where, where and how much you need to fly (like where you were). <br><br>  <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/awad/id424980622%3Fmt%3D8">Install</a> and enjoy your flight!  :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/115774/">https://habr.com/ru/post/115774/</a></p>
