  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Voluntary contribution instead of prepayment</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h4>  How much is a copy? </h4><br>  Let's think about how much an electronic copy costs?  The correct answer: the cost of the electronic copy is zero, or at least tends to this value.  So why everywhere and everywhere, disrupting the natural course of events, we are forbidden to share copies with each other, and instead are forced to pay, pay and pay? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Why? </h4><br>  It's simple.  Technologies are developing very quickly, and nobody knows what to do with them, so we went down the beaten paths: patents, payment for each copy, copy protection.  But the information is non-material, and those rules that apply to material objects do not work here.  Despite this, laws are not passed by scientists and specialists, but by politicians.  That is why today publishers wage war on their own consumers and look for ‚Äúlost profits‚Äù everywhere. <br><br><h4>  It should be? </h4><br>  - First, the author does not need a publisher, because there is the Internet, and everything can be delivered to the ‚Äúclient‚Äù directly, without intermediaries. <br>  - The question of advertising remains controversial, but a good product, distributed freely, has every chance of gaining popularity. <br>  - And finally, payment is the most difficult question, it is the main topic of this manifesto, and we can change everything. <br><br><h4>  Manifest ‚ÄúDonation instead of prepayment‚Äù </h4><br>  If you have the opportunity to replace a commercial product with a free one - do it. <br>  If you use a free product - make a donation. <br>  If you use a free service - make a donation. <br>  If you use any service for a long time or a product that is constantly evolving, set up automatic money disbursement, for example, monthly. <br>  If you are not able to make a big donation, make a small one. <br>  If you do not know how to make a donation, try to find someone who knows and ask for help. <br>  Tell others about the great free product or free service you use.

    <h4>  Notes and recommendations for authors </h4><br>  - The more information about the project is open, the more activity, the better the feedback, the more confidence there will be in the project. <br>  - The easier it is to make a donation, the greater the chance of receiving it. <br>  - The recommended amount of donations will be a plus. <br>  - The main thing: the number of downloads will never be equal or even close to the number of donations, but still, even those who are not ready to pay will distribute information about the product, if it is good, and this will be the best advertisement. <br><br><h4>  Note </h4><br>  This text is the first step to the ‚ÄúDonation instead of prepay‚Äù motivating movement, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhich was born several years ago.  The text can be freely distributed under the <a href="">CC BY-SA license</a> . <br><br><h4>  Need your help </h4><br>  Friends, those who share the above ideas and feel the strength to help - please join.  At this stage, we need: <br>  - edits, additions and ideas related to the text <br>  - the domain name in the org zone (dip.org from ‚Äúdonate instead of prepay‚Äù is already skieber, there is dip.net, but still the .org zone seems to me more suitable) <br>  - logo <br>  - translations (for starters: English, Spanish, Japanese, French, German, Chinese) <br>  Your contribution (logo, translations, etc.) will be included in the manifesto under the license <a href="">CC BY-SA</a> (which means - with the possibility of free use with the obligatory indication of the authors). <br><br>  <b>UPDATE</b> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Alternative 1</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  Manifesto ‚ÄúVoluntary contribution instead of prepayment‚Äù </h4><br>  If you have the opportunity to replace a commercial product with a free one - do it. <br>  If you use a free product - make a voluntary contribution. <br>  If you use a free service - make a voluntary contribution. <br>  If you use any service for a long time or a product that is constantly evolving, set up automatic money disbursement, for example, monthly. <br>  If you are unable to make a large contribution, make a small one. <br>  If you do not know how to make a voluntary contribution, try to find someone who knows and ask for help. <br>  Tell others about the great free product or free service you use. <br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Alternative 2 (comic)</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  Manifesto ‚ÄúTips instead of prepayments‚Äù </h4><br>  If you have the opportunity to replace a commercial product with a free one - do it. <br>  If you use a free product - leave it on the tip. <br>  If you use a free service - leave a tip. <br>  If you use any service for a long time or a product that is constantly evolving, set up automatic tip calculation, for example, monthly. <br>  If you can‚Äôt leave a lot of tips, leave a little. <br>  If you do not know how to leave a tip, try to find someone who knows, and ask for help. <br>  Tell others about the great free product or free service you use. <br></div></div><br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Alternative 3</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><h4>  Manifest ‚ÄúPostpay instead of prepay‚Äù </h4><br>  If you have the opportunity to replace a commercial product with a free one - do it. <br>  If you use a free product, pay for it. <br>  If you use a free service - pay it. <br>  If you use any service for a long time or a product that is constantly evolving - set up automatic payment, for example, monthly. <br>  If you are not able to pay a lot, pay a little. <br>  If you do not know how to pay, try to find someone who knows, and ask for help. <br>  Tell others about the great free product or free service you use. <br></div></div><br><br>  <b>UPDATE2</b> <br><br>  Thank you for supporting those who support it - it is encouraging.
