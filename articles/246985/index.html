  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Efficiency gon</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I once attended a quick reading course.  At the very beginning, there was a measurement of the existing, natural speed, and at the end of the training, another measurement took place so that it was clear that the money was paid for.  It was necessary to read from the long text how much you have time and answer the questions, having received a certain conditional indicator of ‚Äúmeaningful speed reading.‚Äù  In four weeks my test improved almost 5 times. <br><br>  At the first lesson, the moderator asked everyone why they came, and it was interesting.  Someone wanted his career to be more agile, and believed that the ability to read quickly and a lot would contribute to this.  Someone said that he wanted, finally, to get acquainted in detail with world literature and was afraid not to be in time, if read now.  Someone (like me) didn‚Äôt have a clear goal, but he thought it was good to read a thick book in the evening.  In general, terrible nonsense. <br><br>  A few years later, when I conducted trainings on personal effectiveness, time management, and so on, I regretted many times that I did not have the right half a hour after the training began to release half of the hall to their homes.  When a little bit snappy eyes, so clearly visible to people who are well, this exercise is completely useless, and even harmful.  However, each goes his own way, and if it seems to someone that this path is too tortuous and not optimal, then this someone is arrogant and close.  Some corners cannot be cut.  Some stages of life can not be missed.  For many people, this stage is a militant cult of effectiveness. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  To do something effectively means: with less means to achieve greater returns.  Means: constant concern for the result (greed for the result?), Its calculation and control, and frustration, if it is less than it could be.  It would seem that there is nothing wrong with this orientation, especially in our country, where the ability to do something reasonably and sensibly, or even simply diligently and responsibly, is clearly in short supply.  And of course, other things being equal, it is good to achieve the same results with less means.  The problem is that there is practically no "other things equal".  The tool tends to replace the target.  Instead of searching for happiness and inspiration, people switch to the race for indicators, which, in their opinion, should lead to something.

      A good example of this is the growth dynamics of sporting achievements over the past 100 years, beautifully narrated by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3D8COaMKbNrX0%26list%3DFLU5e4yG95OvGPlzyhcKd_Yg">David Epstein</a> .  The resource of the human race, applicable in sports, is not something that increases, but is deeper and more fully drawn out.  From a beautiful but secondary occupation sport has turned into a full-scale industry, with technologies, methods, tremendous monetary pressure, wild competition, attracting a huge number of specialists, international personnel selection, and so on.  It is difficult to argue that here greater results are now being achieved with less means. <br><br>  Like a high-speed car that has nowhere to go, like a huge house, no one can bring anywhere, like a deadly weapon that has no one to defend against, efficiency, without being subordinated to some bright idea, does not make sense, and even hurts, provoking unnecessary actions and states.  Scientific speed reading leads to unjustified tension and develops a consumer attitude to the text, killing that marvelous reading of literary literature, which from childhood was one of my favorite activities.  The forceful set-point setting oppresses the sense of freedom and the luxury of a leisurely self-determination, turning it into a paranoiac living anywhere, just not in the present moment.  Too disciplined management of your time, a weekend of downturn, a calendar that has no living space, days and weeks scheduled in advance ‚Äî all this undermines the joy of life and the feeling that life is eternal. <br><br>  Sometimes I walk through bookstores in a bookstore, where half of the books start with the word "How" (become the best, make a million, start a company, etc., etc.).  And there is not a single book with the word "Why."  Is it clear to everyone why to become the best?  Why should the comparison with someone that ended in my favor should make me happier?  And if not, then what really should? <br><br>  In general, do not pack life to the eyeballs.  You should not look at yourself as a resource in hard work that you need to download in full, because it has already been paid.  This, unfortunately, does not add wholeness, happiness, and often even results. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/246985/">https://habr.com/ru/post/246985/</a></p>
