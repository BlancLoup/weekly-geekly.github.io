Sorry, sought-after and highly paid professionals.  Big Data Engineers, for example, receive from 150,000 rubles in positions that require experience from 3 years, and up to 450,000 rubles in leadership positions in Moscow, and a half to two times higher abroad. <br><br>  Meanwhile, the real situation with these specialists in the market is somewhat more complicated.  Approximately as with economists: Russian universities for decades produce them every year, not only in commercial quantities, in wholesale quantities, but at the same time any really competent and professional economist is a potential Kozlevich, who will sooner or later come to fool and poach. <br><br>  So it is with Big Data specialists.  Today, many institutions are preparing them, but at the same time finding a competent specialist in the market is another quest!

      NITU "MISiS" is also now receiving documents for the master's program "Ecosystems of Big Data for Digital Transformation".  Only students studying there, like all students of the Institute of Information Business Systems (IIPS NITU MISiS), are usually employed by the end of the first year of study. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5b6/84c/7d0/5b684c7d0add3510eccbb1a35e86d7e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Why it happens?  Why do headhunters immediately hunt on some graduates, while others communicate with employment specialists - and with all the proximity of these professions, the difference is fundamental.  What kind of ‚Äúmagic word‚Äù does the IIPS management know, which has such a magical effect on employers? <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For the answer to this question, we went to the director of the institute, Marina Igorevna Nezhurina, so that she would tell the geeks about the educational strategy of her institute and share information about the rather unique case study of the IIBS. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3f0/cd1/dcb/3f0cd1dcb5485108d6dd5ede44be044d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  - Probably, the fact is that from the very beginning we placed the main emphasis on practical activity.  In general, our institute was organized within the framework of a cooperation agreement between NITU ‚ÄúMISiS‚Äù and well-known IT companies IBS and Borlas as a model of public-private partnership of business and education for training in the magistracy personnel elite specialists in the field of information systems and information technologies . <br><br>  Therefore, our customer is connected to the training of specialists at the stage of student recruitment and the entire educational period is actively involved in the educational process. <br><br>  We are not scattered, we have only two master programs - <b>‚ÄúImplementation of complex information systems based on integration IT solutions‚Äù</b> and <b>‚ÄúEcosystem of big data for digital transformation‚Äù</b> , but we are preparing really good specialists in these areas.  By the way, the IBS graduate model at the Institute of Advanced Information of the NIS ‚ÄúMISiS‚Äù NITU is recognized as a benchmarking model of a public-private partnership between an advanced university and a business customer, both in the educational and business communities. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/281/9c2/9dc/2819c29dc28dd991856751d089bfa399.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The educational trajectory consists of three blocks: system-wide, specialized and practical.  The first semester is devoted to the development of the "foundation" for the further meaningful choice of specialization.  Basic courses such as ‚ÄúBusiness Architecture‚Äù, ‚ÄúProject Management in a Modern Company‚Äù, ‚ÄúArchitecture of Modern Data Warehouses‚Äù, ‚ÄúManagement of Digital Innovations‚Äù are held, special heads of mathematics and programming for working with big data are taught. <br><br>  In the second semester, an in-depth study of specialization begins, either in the field of big data engineering, or in the field of big data analytics, a greater bias is made in mathematics and Machine Learning (machine learning).  After that, students are immersed in real practice, and only project activities begin. <br><br>  It is noteworthy that they set tasks for educational projects, advise student teams and carry out the acceptance of work results by real project managers and leading experts from large IT companies. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7eb/ae6/12f/7ebae612f96ce4434a90259d45c9a34d.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And the students write the master's theses on real projects of companies, where the guys do internships and internships under the guidance of mentors in companies and research managers from the departments of the institute.  And often their design decisions are implemented in the actual processes of customers, and the guys receive the Implementation Acts. <br><br>  Actually, it is always better to explain with an example.  To make it clear what this is about, I‚Äôll just give a few names of recent master's theses: <br><br><ul><li>  Automation system of interdepartmental cooperation for the fulfillment of social financial obligations by the state fund in the framework of the digitalization of health care; </li><li>  Model of digital transformation of oil and gas holding; </li><li>  Integration of Oracle Transportation Management with the system for calculating tariff rates for rail transportation; </li><li>  Predictive model of the occurrence of defects in a slab based on machine learning methods; </li><li>  Reengineering the process of providing public services in the implementation of the unified population register platform; </li><li>  Model of the process of release management of IT services of a large telecommunications company; </li><li>  Methods of developing systems of high-tech products at the stage of preliminary design using a model-based approach; </li><li>  The Internet of Things platform data management model for open source projects. </li></ul><br>  As I have already said, business partners are deeply involved in all stages of the educational process.  For example, the president of Borlas and the deputy general director of IBS are the heads of the basic departments of our institute. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/afa/9df/44e/afa9df44ee3d06a9fe7f343a471e1e48.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I think it is clear what exactly this gives the learner: an order from business for the employment of students and graduates of master's programs, platforms for working out design solutions, virtual capacities for laboratory and practical work, real business cases from various sectors of the economy, such as retail, HR , financial sphere, metallurgy, as well as the full cycle - a survey and description of business processes, reengineering, collecting and analyzing big data (Big Data), building predictive models.  At the same time, the best students from the project teams are hired into the company staff, and an important aspect for the student is that the work of students in practice and internship in projects is well paid. <br><br>  Therefore, at the output we have a specialist trained in modern methodologies, approaches and technologies with at least a year experience. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e1/2e7/bb4/6e12e7bb48510c34c710ea419d977f0a.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Employment after graduation in all 11 years of the institute‚Äôs existence is 100%.  And our graduates work in the largest Russian and foreign companies (IBS, Borlas, IT Co., SAP CIS, SaaS, BearingPoint, etc.) in key positions.  One of them - in general, is now the deputy mayor of Nizhny Novgorod for IT. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/458130/">https://habr.com/ru/post/458130/</a></p>
