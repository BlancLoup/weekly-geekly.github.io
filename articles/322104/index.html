On the one hand, replies are inevitable - people‚Äôs interests, hobbies and needs change over time, and your newsletter may not be necessary.  Another thing is when the list of unsubscribers grows due to the fact that by your actions you provoke a desire to unsubscribe and not have any more business with you. <br><br>  To help you deal with the problem of unsubscribing, we have prepared tips and practical examples. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>What level of unsubscribe is acceptable?</b>

      The unsubscribe rate is the ratio of unsubscribed recipients to the number of delivered letters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/35d/d84/2f3/35dd842f392b4d7ba048fdb08dd37ba1.jpg"><br><br>  Replies accompany every email campaign.  The only question is what percentage of formal replies is valid.  It is believed that within 1% - this is a normal indicator, and everything above 1% should lead to a revision of the email marketing strategy.  But first we propose to understand the reasons. <br><br>  <b>The main reasons for unsubscribing:</b> <br><br>  1. The subscriber did not consent to the newsletter; <br>  2. Irrelevant and unexpected content; <br>  3. Too frequent sending emails; <br>  4. The base is not monitored for the presence of inactive addresses, the reactivation companies are not conducted; <br>  5. Irritating, intrusive or aggressive content. <br><br><h3>  Follow Antispam policy requirements. </h3><br>  Sending commercial letters without the consent of the recipient is not just unethical, it is also against the law. <br><br>  Email distribution, in accordance with paragraph 1, of Article 18 of the Federal <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_58968/f892dec1383709792452f18d36e7043306e2be0a/">Law "On Advertising"</a> , is allowed only with the prior permission of the addressee to receive letters. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b28/c02/c06/b28c02c06ab845639f28506cdae3bfcf.png"></div><br>  Before sending email, make sure that email addresses are collected in a legal way. <br><br>  Check out the <a href="https://support.sendpulse.com/index.php%3Ftype%3Dpage%26urlcode%3D459012%26title%3D%25D0%25A7%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2581%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D1%258F-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BB%25D1%258F-%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D1%258B%25D0%25BB%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">full list of what can be considered a permission for email distribution</a> and only sign up for those users who want to receive them. <br><br>  This is the most basic truth that will provide your email campaigns with a lower percentage of unsubscribes. <br><br><h3>  Mailing lists should bring value and benefits. </h3><br>  It would be naive to believe that people will read your newsletters, if the latter do not bring them any value or value. <br><br>  <b>What can you offer to subscribers:</b> <br><br>  <i>- practical benefits or problem solving.</i> <br><br>  To determine what difficulties your audience faces most often, feel free to ask support and sales.  They work closely with customers and know what difficulties your customers face most often.  Based on collected ideas, write articles or step-by-step instructions and include them in the mailing lists. <br><br>  If there are no such departments in your company, follow customer feedback at all possible sites: social networks, website, thematic forums, and do not forget to monitor the mailings of reputable competitors. <br><br>  The Anywayanyday company in the letter shares tips on finding the cheapest tickets for travel. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01f/45f/08c/01f45f08cedc44d786c997e55975f9bf.png"></div><br>  <i>- educational content.</i> <br><br>  The lion's share of educational content and a minimum of advertising is one of the rules for successful distribution.  Educational content is the best for digests and newsletters.  Although there are practices, when and in the promotional letter below put an article from the blog.  Experiment how it will work for you. <br><br>  Here's a great example of a digest from National Geographic.  The letter is full of interesting articles and the minimum of advertising that is in it is not at all annoying. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/559/76e/d65/55976ed6578d4cb1a4efd42784a66524.png"><br><br>  <i>- lead magnet.</i> <br><br>  We suggest reading about them in detail in our article <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sendpulse/blog/320644/">‚ÄúLead magnets that magnetise</a> . <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sendpulse/blog/320644/">‚Äù</a> <br><br><h3>  Segment the list of recipients </h3><br>  This approach in email marketing allows you to develop different offers for each target audience. <br><br>  According to Lyris Inc, <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/sendpulse/blog/318676/">segmentation of the list of recipients</a> has a positive impact on literally all email campaign metrics: 39% of marketers noted an increase in discovery, 34% improved relevancy, 28% achieved a decrease in formal replies. <br><br>  By segmenting recipients by geography, you can send a targeted newsletter to subscribers by region in which the action or event takes place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/410/3ec/ba2/4103ecba27bf4d538d1295eb54511657.jpg"><br><br><h3>  Personalize </h3><br>  Personalization allows you to insert personal information about the user in the letter.  Even in such a simple way, as personalization by name, you can come up with something new.  The Burberry fashion brand has succeeded in this by offering to embroider the initials of the future owner in gold letters.  In the letter you can see how the bag with your initials will look like. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32a/664/f7c/32a664f7cd9047f89fd2662cca9d2d54.png"><br><br>  How to technically embody personalization in a letter, read the <a href="https://support.sendpulse.com/index.php%3Ftype%3Dpage%26urlcode%3D689923%26title%3D%25D0%25A7%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE-%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5-%25D1%2583%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA-%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B5-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25B7%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%258C">manual from SendPulse</a> . <br><br><h3>  Submit relevant content </h3><br>  Relevant or individually selected content is the result of good segmentation. <br><br>  Now in the West it is very popular to provide the subscriber with a choice of interesting content in special personalization cabinets.  As a result, a person gets exactly what he wants to see in his mailbox and the mailing does not look like intrusive spam. <br><br>  Curiosity.com website is dedicated to educational articles and videos.  When subscribing to a newsletter, the user is asked to set up his own list of interests, on the basis of which letters will be received.  Each subscriber will choose something for his taste, because the list is quite large: about the planet, animals, art, design, business, food, health, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e25/aaa/349/e25aaa34931541b4aa734c823660caa4.png"><br><br>  In case the subscriber wants to change his decision regarding the selected categories of content, give him the right to choose in the email distribution settings. <br><br>  The Astley Clarke jewelry brand puts a link at the end of each letter that can be updated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1c6/2ad/c69/1c62adc6957e4acbab1058038efb537a.png"><br><br>  The link has the following options: <br><br>  - information on new collections; <br>  - gift guides; <br>  - exclusive offers and sales; <br>  - tips stylists; <br>  - contests. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ab2/717/4d6/ab27174d62904d7b95216932b2b51db4.png"><br><br><h3>  Solve the problem of too frequent mailings. </h3><br>  In half of the cases, people unsubscribe from email mailings because they are literally being showered with letters about and without.  From this two outputs: <br><br>  - write only when you have something to say <br>  - or let people choose the frequency of receiving newsletters. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4a8/14d/e93/4a814de93592480d87608c14a43ddfc2.png"><br><br><h3>  Learn about the reason for unsubscribe </h3><br>  No matter how well you conduct email marketing, there will still be a reply.  But before saying goodbye to the subscriber, you can ask why he no longer wants to receive the newsletter.  In SendPulse, you can <a href="https://support.sendpulse.com/index.php%3Ftype%3Dpage%26urlcode%3D211607%26title%3D%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA-%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D1%258C-%25D0%25BF%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8-%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0-%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2586%25D1%2583-%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">easily add a page with the reasons for unsubscribing</a> .  This way you will receive another feedback channel. <br><br>  Below is a good example of a questionnaire from Megaplan. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/004/97d/bcc/00497dbcce554d7294b4b9811d80a5c6.jpg"></div><br><h3>  <b>Offer a different way of communication instead.</b> </h3><br>  It is likely that some of your subscribers will unsubscribe because it is easier for them to follow you through other channels, such as a blog or social networks.  So why not put social network buttons, a blog, etc. on the unsubscribe page? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b5f/1b8/dfe/b5f1b8dfeb984672b842a68b8006b01b.png"><br><br>  We hope that by applying our advice in practice, you will be able to significantly reduce the level of formal reply.  And we will be happy if the solutions in this article will help your database grow, not decrease.  <a href="https://sendpulse.com/ru">Send newsletters to SendPulse</a> ! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322104/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322104/</a></p>
