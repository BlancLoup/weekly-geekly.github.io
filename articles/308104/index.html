Briefly about myself: I have been programming since 1989, since 2005 in Java, since 2013 I have been working as a Java-trainer (until January of this year I combined it with the main work of a Java-developer).  Quite a lot of my graduates got employed, and I want to share my thoughts on how to get a Java developer job (and not only Java). <br><br><h3>  From studying Java to getting a job offer - long distance </h3><br>  Requirements for candidates for a Java developer job are quite high, see an example of a <a href="http://www.cyberforum.ru/java-j2ee/thread1670800.html">test job for a junior from one of the RB outsourcers</a> .  Of course, there are positions with less requirements, but there are not so many of them and, <a href="https://jobs.dou.ua/trends/%3Fcategory%3DJava%26exp%3D-1">according to statistics in Ukraine</a> (dou works through a proxy, I have not found it in Russia), the ratio Responses / Vacancies to such positions is from 20 to 50.

      <br>
      For vacancies with work experience (of which there are significantly more), a vicious circle is obtained: without experience, not to get a job, and without work, not to get experience.  The answer to the question ‚ÄúWho is to blame?‚Äù Is obvious - companies that do not want to invest time and money in training, but want to get a ready-made specialist.  The main question remains: <br><br><h3>  What to do? </h3><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Large companies mainly <a href="https://dou.ua/lenta/articles/juniors-2015/">close junior positions with their interns</a> .  One of the employment options is to go on an internship, but <br><br><ul><li>  there is also a big competition </li><li>  far from all who have successfully completed internships get jobs </li><li>  sometimes learning conditions are quite difficult and not suitable for everyone.  From the review about the internship at EPAM RB: <blockquote>  Everything is so terribly strict there that I am still in shock.  They have a strong selection there ... everything is evaluated, dz, tests, oral surveys, well, at the end the protection of their project.  We are assigned task and put deadlines.  I didn‚Äôt have time to fill in the task - everything, good-bye ... I feel like in school ... Until we have a list of 200-230 questions on almost all the topics that we should know without hesitation.  We conduct summaries (!), A written answer to each question and it is checked ... Epam himself trains programmers differently and you will not say ... </blockquote></li></ul><br>  The steps of another variant are well known (Jacob Fane's excellent video " <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dft0Nj8Cm9kk">How to become a professional Java developer</a></b> "): <br><br><ul><li>  Good summary </li><li>  Invitations for interviews and training in their passage </li><li>  Getting an offer </li></ul><br>  A good (prominent) resume means that HR notices it and sends you an invitation for an interview. <br>  On the Internet there are a large number of recommendations on how to achieve this: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://resumup.com/">Choose a resume template</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://ain.ua/2015/01/14/558261">Junior's perfect summary</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://lifehacker.ru/2015/04/07/33-lajfhaka-dlya-rezyume/">How to sell your resume 2 times more expensive</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="http://enjoy-job.ru/trudoustroistvo/kak-pravilno-sostavit-rezume/">How to make a resume</a> <br></li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184332/">Resume programmers.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184332/">Part 1 (bad)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184372/">Resume programmers.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/184372/">Part 2 (good)</a> </li><li>  <a href="http://skyeng.ru/articles/sostavte-rezyume-na-anglijskom-450-primerov">How to create a resume in English</a> </li></ul><br>  But, in my opinion, the main thing: <br><br><h3>  Position yourself NOT as a junior. </h3><br>  For this you need: <br><br><ul><li>  A good understanding of the basics: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DNwsMQT-6V-M">how the memory is arranged</a> , what is <a href="http://www.javaspecialist.ru/2011/06/java-memory-model.html">JMM</a> , experience with servlets, JUnit, SQL <br></li><li>  Level up Java Core: Maven, Spring basics (MVC, Security, Test), JPA (Hibernate), REST.  Also desirable are the basics of javascript and html / css <br></li></ul><br>  There are a lot of materials on Java frameworks and technologies on the Internet.  But if you want to master them, and not read / see and forget, <b>you need to write your own pet project on them</b> .  This may be a project of a home library or bookkeeping, or feeding the cat or ... Well, if there is a real need for it - then during its operation you will gradually come to the optimal solutions. <br><br>  It is best to do it on the basis of a small project on a popular stack, for example, the reference implementation of <b><a href="https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic">Spring Pet clinic</a></b> .  From the first time to make the code beautiful and correct, not even a signor.  The project should live and carry its owner the joy of initiation to the beauty of the code through refactoring.  And, apart from understanding technology and developing a sense of per-red, from working on your own project you get the skills of finding <b>beautiful and practical solutions for specific tasks</b> and <b>solving specific problems</b> that make up the daily work of a programmer.  For this you need: <br><br><ul><li>  understanding how frameworks work, what they are based on, what patterns are used </li><li>  outlook, skills in solving such problems </li><li>  working with tools: Git, IDEA, Maven, Tomcat, DB client, testing REST services </li><li>  the ability to find the right solutions on the Internet (70-80% is the ability to choose from those found in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a> ) </li></ul><br>  This task is not easy and, if there is not enough time, knowledge, experience, I recommend to pass some Java Enterprise training on this stack, be sure to write a project based on the passed technologies at the exit.  My training criteria: <br><br><ul><li>  Leads a teacher with experience in Java development, better as a signor or architect </li><li>  Maximum coverage: the most important and necessary Java developer themes, APIs, frameworks, tools in one course. <br></li><li>  During the training, a completed Enterprise project is being developed.  Topics are not separately (in the air) on the examples removed, but sequentially, in conjunction, as additions to the creation of a single, working application. </li><li>  Consistently increasing complexity: from zero to deploy the finished application to the cloud </li><li>  Practice!  Participants throughout the course should work with the project code.  Compulsory homework.  If they give only a theory (a little of everything), then this, in my opinion, is money thrown away and time.  Without practice, any training (Java, English, cycling) is worth nothing. </li><li>  Support for the group and teacher: the opportunity to ask any question and get a qualified answer to it. </li><li>  Accessibility and structured materials </li><li>  Review your code. </li><li>  Assistance in the preparation of resumes and employment.  If you are guaranteed at the end of 100% employment - do not believe.  Well said in the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/1cloud/blog/304694/">article about the work of the developer</a> : <br><blockquote>  The work of a programmer is not so much a profession as a lifestyle.  University education, self-education, hobbies and, importantly, passion are key components of success in this area. </blockquote></li></ul><br>  After you have experience in your own Java Enterprise project, <br><br><h3>  Make a new resume: </h3><br>  A typical Java junior resume begins like this: <br><blockquote>  Start a career as a junior Java developer in a modern, promising company, in 3 years to become a specialist ... <br>  We train well ... <br>  Opt work: no <br>  Passed courses ... </blockquote><br>  Need to: <br><br><ul><li>  remove the words "start a career", "junior" and "ready to learn" </li><li>  insert into the qualification all the technologies you studied </li><li>  in work experience write about participation in the project with its brief description </li></ul><br>  For example, WORK EXPERIENCE: <br>  Participation in the development of Spring / JPA Enterprise applications with authorization and role-based access rights on the Maven / Spring MVC / Security / REST (Jackson) / Java 8 Stream API stack: <br><br><ul><li>  implementation of saving to the Postgres and HSQLDB databases based on Spring JBDC, JPA (Hibernate) and Spring-Data-JPA </li><li>  implementation and testing of REST and AJAX controllers </li><li>  client implementation on Bootstrap (css / js), datatables, jQuery + plugins. </li></ul><br>  You may not be afraid to apply for such vacancies with a requirement of 1-2 years of experience and, possibly, go to the next level: ‚ÄúInvitations for interviews and training in their passage‚Äù, which already requires a separate article. <br><br>  Thank you for your attention and wish you an excellent IT career. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/308104/">https://habr.com/ru/post/308104/</a></p>
