In this regard, I decided to describe the detailed <b>mechanism of</b> human <b>laziness</b> . <br>  However, I want to encourage you, laziness is only a manifestation of the work of our subconscious, which means it can be controlled and ‚Äútuned‚Äù as you wish.  You yourself can see this when you understand the mechanism of its occurrence. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Laziness is the reluctance to do anything.  Technically speaking: laziness is the lack of motivation of the psyche to perform a certain sequence of actions to achieve any previously known goal.  From here we can immediately see the three components of the mechanism of laziness, each of which can create it: <br>  <b>1. Point of reference.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>2. Procedure.</b> <b><br></b>  <b>3. The ultimate goal.</b> <br><br>  As soon as an imbalance occurs (point of reference), the person forms the final goal, which is the restoration of the initial state (comfort), and depending on the person‚Äôs experience (prediction models), the person chooses the course of action to achieve the goal. <br>  Let us examine each item separately. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      <b>Starting point</b> <br>  The reason for the occurrence of any action should be an imbalance of the psyche (in particular a violation of human homeostasis), which must be restored.  The nature of the human body most motivates us to the most simple actions that are important for survival, which is why very few people are too lazy to "eat if hungry."  In the area of ‚Äã‚Äãbasic human instincts, laziness does not arise. <br>  In the case of more complex behavior that a person possesses, everything is much more ambiguous. <br>  For example: <br>  The wife nags her husband, who for several months "did not bring a penny into the house" and sits playing WOW: "Go get a job!".  Husband - laziness.  The reason for laziness: everything suits him, except for the constant reminders of his wife.  But since the opportunity to do nothing and play, for his more pleasant and valuable than irritation from the words of his wife, he will continue to sit and be lazy. <br><br>  Any action must have a point of reference: necessity, inconvenience, need, etc.  This point of reference should be individual, not imposed.  You will only do something if you are really uncomfortable.  This point is closely intersected with the "Ultimate Goal", since the point of reference always uniquely determines what goal should be achieved. <br><br>  In our example, the husband really starts to stir only when his food runs out, disconnect the Internet for non-payment, and generally ‚Äúblock the oxygen‚Äù. <br><br>  A separate important point is the current state of a person, as it also affects the point of reference for the choice of behavior.  If you are even motivated to achieve a goal, but are simply physically tired or emotionally involved in some problem, motivation may also fall, but this is more often associated not only with laziness and refers to the topic of the article only indirectly. <br><br>  <b>Procedure</b> <br>  The most common cause of laziness in the current society is the ambiguity of the order of actions, i.e.  ways to achieve the goal.  A person will not be internally motivated to take certain actions if his subconscious tells him that there is a more effective way: a faster one, requiring less expenditure of resources and effort, etc. <br>  For example: <br>  An office employee is lazy to do his job in the workplace.  He has a point of reference (it is necessary to complete the work), but he is lazy.  The reason for laziness is that he knows that doing this work is not necessary now, but you can just sit on Vkontakte.  He saves his resources. <br><br>  It is very important to take into account the moment that the subconscious is primarily guided by fast models of prediction, that is, what will happen in the near future or is happening now.  Distant perspectives are much less motivational, since the subconscious mind perceives them as less probable, and therefore not prioritized, time will tell. <br><br>  For example, student preparation for the session motivational increases as the session itself approaches.  The motivation of an office employee increases significantly as the decision to award him an award comes closer. <br><br>  Again, it is important to take into account the moment that if the motivation of the student is not knowledge, but ‚Äúpaintings in the record book‚Äù, then the ways of achieving them will be different for him.  For example, not to prepare and teach the material, but to ‚Äúcajole the teacher‚Äù.  That is why if a student has been able to get at least one exam ‚Äúfor free‚Äù at least once, then the likelihood that he will stop preparing for other exams will increase significantly, because motivation falls due to the formation of a new, more resource-effective strategy and a change in end goals. <br><br>  <b>Final goal</b> <br>  The ultimate goal completely determines which strategy will be chosen.  Also, the ultimate goal should always be tied to the values ‚Äã‚Äãand needs of the person. <br>  In the human community is very common mechanism of learning, in which a person is vaccinated with goals, the value of which he does not realize for himself. <br>  For example: Parents tend to tell a student that he should receive a diploma so that he has a higher education.  No motivation will arise from such a ‚Äúgrafting of a target‚Äù.  The student simply will not subconsciously understand what is the relationship between his needs and the "piece of paper".  The worst option is if the student will be motivated to study at the institute for the purpose of "as long as the ancestors do not buzz." <br>  What will be the goal, so it will reach people. <br><br>  By the way, if you are trying to form motivation in a person, even in your own child, develop his prediction models so that his subconscious and consciousness understand the importance of these actions.  Then the man himself "will rush" to achieve it. <br>  It is also important to take into account the fact that the goals that you set for another person can often be completely inadequate and even harmful to him, since your experience is different from that person‚Äôs experience. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br>  All of these points are intuitive and obvious, but most of us prefer to ignore them and are guided only by sensations. <br>  This is the most common mechanism that describes almost all cases of laziness.  There are even less common variations that are already associated with mental problems, but this is a separate conversation. <br><br>  <b>If you have decided in detail with all these points, have worked with their consciousness: you have found the true point of reference, determined what purpose you are pursuing, exactly how your subconscious tells you to achieve this goal, then no laziness will arise in principle.</b> <br><br>  Consciousness does not operate with feelings, it "realizes".  The subconscious mind tries to guide us through life in an optimal way, more precisely in the way that it considers optimal based on past experience, and it does it with the help of feelings, including laziness. <br><br>  <b>P.S</b> <br>  As I mentioned in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/artificial_intelligence/110807/">last article</a> , these notes are created as part of the <a href="http://hs2.me/hs2book">HS2.0</a> project (I hope I can handle the habra effect :).  In part, of course, this is advertising, but the goal pursued by this project is not to earn money and create traffic, but to provide information about the psyche, which is simple and completely free, because we are all human.  You are free not to read, it is only your choice, but someone like this information may be vital, so I ask you to treat with respect in the same way as you readers. <br>  If there is a desire to learn more about some mechanisms of the psyche and the subconscious that you have not yet been able to find on the project, then write to hs2adm@gmail.com <br>  While plans to add a note on the mechanism of interest.  I believe that this will also be quite relevant for the majority of Habr's readers. <br>  Thank you for your attention and all the best for you) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/111571/">https://habr.com/ru/post/111571/</a></p>
