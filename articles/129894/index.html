      I was at the concert of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra on Wednesday evening, when news of his demise spread through the hall.  I think it is unlikely that most viewers could hear the music in the next fifteen minutes, until they reached the meaning of what happened. <br><br>  He was the greatest marketer of our generation.  Not only because of their ability to create products that consumers desire, but <a name="habracut"></a>  ability to properly present them. <br><br>  One day, someone said that Jobs understood the concept of ‚Äúdesire‚Äù better than anyone.  I think this is so because I can honestly say that I wanted almost everything that he created: I have all the products of Apple. <br><br>  A lot of things can be said about Steve Jobs, but here are ten facts about him that personally lead me to admiration. <br><br>  10. He never used focus groups ‚Äî he quoted Henry Ford: ‚ÄúIf I asked what my consumers want, they would answer ‚Äî a faster horse.‚Äù <br><br>  9. He remained faithful to one ad agency - the incredible TBWA / Chiat / Day.  He showed special loyalty to his main creative leader, Lee Clow.  (Listen to the episode of Age of Persuasion, which is called ‚Äú <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/ageofpersuasion/episode/season-5/2011/04/02/season-five-dynamic-duos-the-famous-partnerships-in-advertising-2/">Dynamic Duos,</a> ‚Äù to see what kind of relationship they had.) <br><br>  8. He offered to pay the ‚Äú <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DOYecfV3ubP8">1984</a> ‚Äù movie out of his own pocket, when the entire board of directors was categorically against his showing.  His instincts did not let him down: he said that this would be the most famous commercial of all time, and he was right. <br><br>  7. Yes, he was famous for dismissing an employee right in the elevator.  But as one of his colleagues said, ‚Äúif your IQ was a hundred higher than most of all those with whom you talk, it would annoy you all the time.‚Äù <br><br>  6. He went to the office in the morning and shouted: ‚Äúall to the fields!‚Äù, And then drove all his designers to the museum to show only a small detail on one of the sculptures.  Then they jumped back to the bus and returned to the office.  For him, god was in the details. <br><br>  5. He specifically went to the Chupa Chups factory to figure out how to make the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù colors in the 1998 Maki. <br><br>  4. At a press conference about the iPod, he confidently described its simplicity like this: ‚Äústick it in, you'll be ready‚Äù. <br><br>  3. When, after an 11-year exile, he returned to Apple, he was so horrified by what he saw that he sold all his shares, except for one - the symbolic one. <br><br>  2. When he tried to lure Pepsi's company president John Scully to work at Apple, he achieved it with one simple phrase: ‚ÄúDo you want to sell sweet water or do you want to change the world?‚Äù <br><br>  1. When TBWA / Chiat / Day showed Jobs the ‚Äú <a href="http://theinspirationroom.com/daily/2005/apple-think-different/">Think Different</a> ‚Äù advertising campaign, which featured such great thinkers of the world as Einstein, Lennon and Gandhi, Jobs rejected only one thing - Steve Jobs. <br><br>  Only in this one decision was he wrong. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129894/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129894/</a></p>
