      The device comes in a small box, black with a golden font.  Strict forms, minimum of graphics, font - everything suggests that in Gigabyte this model is positioned as a phone of a class higher than 1310. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c5e/edd/bf7/c5eeddbf7890095b200a29054456ce00.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ab5/468/825/ab546882513347b4fdda652ec6e70157.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Inside the box is a ‚Äúpedestal‚Äù on which the phone itself lies, and under it is a compartment with accessories, warranty card and instructions.  More precisely - with a ‚Äúquick start guide‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b35/bd6/317/b35bd631766c7046d339beac56d7fbb4.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/977/319/749/9773197491a618b7b81d8101f81a5360.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4db/1f8/b77/4db1f8b778845c6503c0d3baacd7768c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, the kit is standard, but with nuances.  Collapsible type charger with removable plug.  Sync cord is quite long, because  It is designed for charging too, it is with a USB connector.  When plugged into the phone, the plug is inserted with a click, accidentally pulling it out will not be so easy.  We put a plus, everything is competent and high quality. <br>  Headset, wired.  Earbud headphones are the most common, but the sound quality is at the level of similar headphones of this type from well-known companies, and not Chinese consumer goods, which are usually bundled with phones of small firms and practically not removed from the box from the moment of purchase.  What should be noted separately - asymmetrical headphone cord, for wearing behind the neck.  In addition, I was struck by the length of the wire, taking into account the long earpiece - more than 2 meters.  Someone may say - "and what's wrong with that?".  To me, with my height this is really not critical, but there are quite high friends who have to go for all sorts of tricks, because  headphone length is not enough.  With this headset this does not happen, even Uncle Stoupe will suffice. <br>  How do I explain such generosity, I do not know, but definitely - it is rather a plus than a minus. <br>  In addition, the package includes a 4 GB memory card format SDHC Class 4. <br>  In my case, there was obviously some kind of problem with the card, since  Her phone was periodically unmounted and mounted for no apparent reason.  In order to eliminate the malfunction of the slot itself, I inserted my card on the same 4GB - the device accepted it normally and was no longer buggy.  So the fault was in the complete card, if you decide to buy this unit - pay attention to this, check the card when you buy it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4db/1f8/b77/4db1f8b778845c6503c0d3baacd7768c.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Equipment.</i> <br><br>  With a kit - everything.  In my opinion - solid 5. Go to the device itself. <br><br><h4>  Appearance, connectors. </h4><br><br>  The device is entirely plastic, the back cover is matte, but not very marking, which pleases.  This is not a standard soft-touch, but rather rubberized plastic. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/624/c09/0c9/624c090c9c853f09ef8604f2a8275283.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The device also has a plastic edging, painted in silver, of different thickness ‚Äî wider at the top and thinner at the bottom.  It houses the main connectors, etc.  The exception is the microphone hole, but more on that later. <br><br>  On the top panel there is a 3.5 mm headphone hole and a Power button. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f20/ffa/8fc/f20ffa8fc99f4c37cafad8c878c0acf5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The left end is completely empty, on the right there is a volume control swing, a slot for a memory card and a camera power button, it also serves as a trigger key in the Camera application. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9a9/2e4/eaa/9a92e4eaaf8f3f209904e3fabc851c4c.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The microUSB connector is located on the bottom, it serves, as you would expect, for charging and synchronization. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f62/303/66b/f6230366bb3568f0b22f63b2a6986e28.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Now a few words separately about the front panel.  The front panel is made of glossy black plastic and has a so-called chamfer.  Those.  It is slightly cut from the edges of the phone to the screen.  The ends are not rounded out, as is often the case, which would create the effect of an outright remnant, but on the contrary - rounded inward.  It turns out such a ‚Äústep‚Äù around the screen.  At the lower edge of this ‚Äústep‚Äù and the microphone hole is located. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/299/a57/e36/299a57e365ff06ff1521dd33d0492c45.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Behind the hole are a musical speaker and a 5MP camera with flash. <br>  I have to say right away that the speaker for playing music is very quiet, I don‚Äôt see it being used in ordinary phones, I don‚Äôt want to do it at all, than this one.  The volume of the conversational speaker, located on the front panel, is quite sufficient for talking, but with the rear speaker - the bobble is out.  I put a minus purely conditional, since  There is no habit to acquaint others with my musical tastes using the phone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/91c/81a/85b/91c81a85b073bf59db4829ac81901341.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In general, the design of the device resembles some models of Samsung phones like Corby due to the asymmetry of the end face, but at the same time it creates the impression of a more solid phone.  Slightly artsy, but quite within strict limits.  In any case, the designers here obviously worked and I have no complaints about ergonomics, unlike the predecessor, 1310, about which I wrote in the past material. <br>  And finally, Gigabyte abandoned this proprietary round-shaped conversational speaker and buttons under the screen - the speaker became elongated, oval, and the button simply disappeared, and that‚Äôs where the road went.  A minus recognition, but at the same time and a minus to irritation, this trifle simply killed me in the previous models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4e6/12e/246/4e612e24639071d9b232dc82a87764ba.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Gigabyte Gsmart G1345 and Motorola EM30</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0dc/06b/2f7/0dc06b2f73004042a51eb0695dd90de2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Gigabyte Gsmart G1345 and Motorola EM30</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/434/b25/70c/434b2570c045f6cd030512d60cb6ee1a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Gigabyte Gsmart G1345 and Motorola EM30</i> <br><br><h4>  Work with two SIM cards.  Software and stuffing. </h4><br><br>  The device is based on Android 2.3.4 Gingerbread, with some additions to the part of the work with two SIM cards.  Physically, the slots are located as in 1310 - one above the other.  The main sim card is lower, secondary - upper.  Why do I call them that way?  Everything is simple, in order to save energy, the second SIM card is limited only by the GSM band, although in the settings you can assign your role to each SIM card - voice or data.  In any case, even when selecting data for the second SIM, it will function only in GSM. <br>  It can be seen that the software has undergone some processing compared to the previous model, the role of SIM cards is defined in a separate item of the main settings menu, and more detailed settings for each SIM are located in the menu of wireless modules. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a72/828/b2e/a72828b2ee09d80aecd8ec01a219e332.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Display 2 SIM cards in the taskbar.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4dd/0de/f45/4dd0def45bc1da87623059cae2e061a1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Set up SIM cards in a separate menu item.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aa7/b1c/b61/aa7b1cb61ddc5898fbffb2152627da6e.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4a4/87a/3ba/4a487a3baf056ce317420e175cd9cbe3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>The SIM settings menu in the ‚ÄúWireless Networks‚Äù section</i> <br><br>  In addition, the phone phone widget is provided in the device, it is displayed on the screen as a simple shortcut, and when it is pressed, it expands to the phone book widget. <br>  Interestingly, the worse just calling the phone book by clicking on the label - I did not understand.  Moreover, he is already in the lancher, in the bottom panel.  I don‚Äôt know, for me it‚Äôs a cool trick, but it‚Äôs completely meaningless. <br><br>  The filling is slightly lower according to the results of the AnTuTu Benchmark tests. <br>  In the performance rating, the device stands between the HTC Wildfire S and the Sony Ericsson X8.  Not the worst result, at the same time makes it clear what to expect from the device. <br>  Otherwise, the software is quite standard, they did not introduce anything new.  For the sake of the test, I put a couple of toys that are not the most demanding of the processor - they go, they do not slow down, the menu scrolls quickly, no hangs were noticed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0b9/ac8/143/0b9ac8143d09d596316fe3cab833d6d6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7b0/f69/1dd/7b0f691dd51a4183431570f7ac835902.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e81/d2a/13f/e81d2a13fb5528e323591dcad9d21450.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e88/2f5/69b/e882f569bc6fe1e4617f55fb21512d4e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Features </h4><br><br>  By frank cons, very noticeable in operation, I can only include a quiet rear speaker and also a quiet conversational microphone.  More precisely, it is not that quiet, but according to the interlocutors with whom he spoke without a headset, my voice sounded muffled and slightly distorted, which gave a certain effect of boominess.  Whether the result is an elaborate concave panel on which a microphone hole is located, or such is the microphone itself - it is difficult to say, there is no way to compare it with another device of the same model.  You should also pay attention to this when buying - ask to make a test call and listen to how the caller's voice sounds.  Better yourself, let the seller call on another phone, rate this moment with your own ear, this is important. <br>  I will give one more fat minus to the designers for the system of opening the back cover of the device, it must be pushed in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe microUSB connector and pulled.  So the instruction told me, for which she thanks, I myself would not have guessed.  There is a small groove, for which it is supposed to hook the cover, but with short nails it is not easy to do.  Girls can ruin a manicure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/435/af6/c46/435af6c467013119e98f2ee84eb8231a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Here it is, this keyway, in the photo - just to the left of the sync connector.</i> <br><br>  In addition, by experience, this way of opening the lid is fraught with breakage of fastening latches, so I wouldn‚Äôt open the phone once again without need.  The topic is more that such a need arises only for the purpose of replacing a SIM card, there are two of them here, you should put it once and forget about them. <br><br>  In general, I had a positive impression of the phone, I did not think that I might need a phone with two sims, but I would buy this one myself. <br>  1500 mAh battery, 320x480 capacitive type screen, Android 2.3, cost around 8 m.  - all this makes the device quite an interesting candidate for a gift to relatives or a loved one in case there are two SIM cards, for example, a work card and a personal one. <br>  There are frank minuses, but the progress in the development of this line of devices from the manufacturer is also clearly visible, which is good news.  Moreover, it is still the only device on the market, built on Android 2.3. <br><br>  To buy it or not is up to you, but it‚Äôs worth a closer look - that's for sure. <br><br>  All photos in the review are available in higher resolution <a href="http://fotki.yandex.ru/users/ragnamaniac/album/177905/%3Fp%3D0">by reference</a> . <br>  I apologize for not very high-quality photos - it's time I had to change the camera. <br><br>  In conclusion, a few examples of photos taken on the G1345. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a5e/278/f18/a5e278f18f5ca4f513843c4ac287a9a3.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>City, in the evening, flash is on.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/443/ac4/ce2/443ac4ce2c74eb6fdba45457cf459174.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>From the bus window, the flash is on.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/342/50f/590/34250f590d0a44c587a04e9f7868aa93.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Indoors, with electric lighting, flash in automatic mode.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/637/981/878/63798187835651a1d38053a8af940ff6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Indoors, with electric lighting, flash in automatic mode.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/281/11c/660/28111c66093a17ef127789a58f7d3847.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Indoors, with electric lighting, the flash is off.</i> <br><br><h4>  All the upcoming holidays, thank you for your attention. </h4><br><br>  UPD: At the request of comments, I post a comparative tablet of the currently available dual-card android phones on the market from the press release. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/289/c30/729/289c30729f8a95ce9708c5ceb308cf58.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/135162/">https://habr.com/ru/post/135162/</a></p>
