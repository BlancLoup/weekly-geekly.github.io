Among the most well-known IQToy stores with such an assortment, it was further pleasant to see that (for the time being relatively small) shelves of Detsky Mir, a network, began to be replenished with gadget toys, sometimes something very simple appears in Daughters-Sonnies.

      I got Kakadu Pen in two stores at once: IQToy for 1290 and ‚ÄúChildren's World‚Äù for 599 rubles.  I think it is clear exactly where I bought it. <br><br>  In fact, the pen is a stylus with a small interactive component, where the main thing is the application for Ipad.  In this case, for 600 rubles, you would like to buy an authorization key to this software, after which it becomes available in full. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d0/21c/382/6d021c382b05414c9cd260cd42936eea.PNG"><br><br>  In total there are 5 main sections and 1 - the parent, where you can keep track of classes, books read and lessons learned, set reminders, or schedule: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/834/3a4/e6b/8343a4e6b4644b529bc453b3ac349a8c.jpg"><br><br>  Access to parental control, as well as to some functions, is carried out through the "formula". <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a07/950/d8d/a07950d8d82d4d1bb81a77f405c62ff3.PNG"><br><br>  In particular, it makes available content that is not downloaded immediately from the AppStore: encyclopedias and books in the corresponding training sections.  After downloading, the material is deposited in the library, but not in one common, which would be logical, but in the library of the section where they were downloaded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/223/92a/6e7/22392a6e79954225b5815e2412d5bbc9.jpg"><br><br>  Some books, such as encyclopedias, can only be read, with some you can work.  Such materials are in the training section. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ed/cb8/7be/5edcb87bedaf43f5b4b2d6e7f75be6b6.jpg"><br>  <i>Letters can be written with tickers and without</i> <br><br>  In the music section there are both music and short stories: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/34e/627/a08/34e627a0873c4b4bb1b074d00c18fd37.jpg"><br><br>  In the section "School of the Arts" - coloring and drawings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b41/307/bed/b41307bedb1f4e5f980e5bc3c4b90abd.jpg"><br><br>  You can draw by yourself or according to an auxiliary scheme, and paint it either with a fill, or methodically guiding the stylus along a ‚Äúcanvas‚Äù. <br><br>  In fact, nothing that I would not have seen in other applications, where the child could trace the numbers with his finger, paint over drawings, count or write, I have not met.  Actually, this application also works quietly ‚Äúfrom the finger‚Äù, so the handle itself is such a key souvenir for it for 600 rubles.  As a gift - she, by the way, would be very personal.  Packed quite attractively: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/75c/87d/62e/75c87d62e06147bc958d216c7369b326.JPG"><br><br>  Inside the box is a short instruction on how to connect the pen to the tablet and the alarming note that should be placed on the external part: ‚Äú1 month warranty from the date of sale‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/29f/ea8/2c4/29fea82c4cf74a8f8922c1b4e9cd0f42.JPG"><br><br>  It does not have its own battery, it works on ‚Äúmizinchikovyh‚Äù batteries.  Some controls are placed on the body: for example, a change between the pen and the eraser during drawing, cancellation of an action, repeated input. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3b7/701/b46/3b7701b463f14a1692ae87220acee6f8.JPG"><br><br>  Also on the side wheel, which can switch modes: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/471/ccf/443/471ccf443c5f4aa996c840bcfa5f08d9.jpg"><br><br>  The stylus seemed too large, although able to draw thin lines.  And this is critical, for example, in educational materials, where it is a matter of keeping the numbers or letters inside the contour.  A focused child's hand with a wide stylus - very much at risk to get out of the box. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9b0/daf/699/9b0daf69941941b9bc33f190c49c2ef6.JPG"><br><br>  At the same time, I must say that the pen itself is ‚Äútoo thick‚Äù for children; it is clearly not very convenient to hold it: Arseny changed hands several times - to no avail: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ad8/867/66b/ad886766b18e4fe7b7c50136ecef6510.JPG"><br><br>  As a result, I received a rather large ‚Äúkey‚Äù to several applications collected in one place, which are educational in nature.  The key is not very convenient, but at the same time it is perfectly decorated, and can qualify (if we are talking about 599 rubles) as a good souvenir to a child.  For 1290, I would have thought. <br><br>  Perhaps this will help you make / or not make a gift choice. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/391923/">https://habr.com/ru/post/391923/</a></p>
