  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We make a personal offer in the presentation format</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8ad/9bd/432/8ad9bd4327f641a0a52ba34a1aa8d897.png"><br><br>  In this article I want to share our experience of using presentations in the form of personal commercial offers.  It so happened that we ourselves use the tools that we offer to our customers, and have accumulated enough knowledge to give some tips on their use. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  1. Making a pattern </h2><br>  So, the first thing we start with is creating a presentation template.  This is done in order to quickly insert relevant information there and establish communication with potential customers.  The template provides several types of slides, which are used depending on the situation.  For example, we often use slides like ‚Äúwas - became‚Äù to show how the client‚Äôs presentation looks and works (more precisely, does not work) now and what can come out of it after our modest intervention.  Other typical slides for such a template: a reminder of the existence of a problem, solutions to this problem, a description of the proposed solution, the price of such a solution, a call to action, etc. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <h2>  2. Identify (or create) a problem </h2><br>  Having already a certain template, we are looking for companies that might be interested in our services.  It is quite logical that in our case we are looking at the availability, structure and design of the presentations and commercial offers of the companies found.  After that, we estimate how much the company is interested in changing these materials and whether it is one of the important selling tools for it.  If we work with an incoming request, then everything is even easier there - if people ask us questions about these services, then there is already a certain interest. <br><br><h2>  3. Create a unique offer. </h2><br>  When an interested customer is found, we proceed to the analysis of its activities and how it works with sales tools.  At this stage, it is necessary to understand how we can specifically help him, describe possible options for working together and orient a potential client by cost and time.  For each of these items, we take the slides from the template and fill them with a unique offer that we have just developed for this particular company. <br><br><h2>  4. We are looking for a decision maker </h2><br>  Having prepared a personal commercial offer, it is necessary to find a person who will communicate with us on behalf of the company on this issue.  It would seem that with incoming requests everything is very simple: who wrote, he will be engaged in the company, but in fact he may not make decisions on this issue, and the real customer will actually be his boss (and it‚Äôs good if he will be alone).  In such a situation, the process of communicating with a client is very much delayed and all work is redone several times, because everyone has his own opinion on how all this should be done.  This forces us to make our way every time to the person who is actually the customer and makes decisions (I‚Äôll say right away that in large companies this is far from always, but usually we find some kind of compromise).  If we ourselves go to a company, then the company‚Äôs website, social networks (especially LinkedIn), and communication with other employees usually help us in finding such a person. <br><br><h2>  5. We start communication and send a commercial offer. </h2><br>  Highlighting an employee who may be interested in communicating with us, we find his contacts and determine the most appropriate means of communication.  The ways of interaction are always different and depend on the presence of mutual friends, the publicity of a person and other factors, but the result is always the same: we deliver our proposal to the address and start discussing possible options for work. <br><br>  This method is not massive and is poorly suited for processing a large number of orders or cold mail, but I hope that it will be useful to someone and will be effectively applied in your field.  We in the Slidary studio are always ready to help with the preparation of presentations and business proposals that really work and sell the goods / services of our clients. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/305638/">https://habr.com/ru/post/305638/</a></p>
