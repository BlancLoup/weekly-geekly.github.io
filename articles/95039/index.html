  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tivoli Foundations: an effective IT department in small and medium business</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Small and medium-sized businesses all their attention paid to commercial activities, and funds are primarily spent on doing business.  In order to compete and stay afloat, often the only means is to reduce costs.  It is important to maintain the quality of the product / service and quality of service.  Otherwise, customers will go to competitors.  What is most often affected by cost reduction?  That's right, in marketing and IT.  We will talk about marketing and marketers some other time.  And now let's see how in a small company an IT department can help develop a business. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Immediately make a reservation about how to use unlicensed / counterfeit products, organizing mailings, automatic calling, etc.  there won't be a word here.  Yes, this is not a function of the IT department and IT staff, as many directors would not like to think.  The main responsibility of IT specialists in the company, in our opinion, is the creation and organization of conditions conducive to more efficient business operations.  The key word here is effective.  How is this achieved?  By automating a number of processes, accelerating decision making, minimizing risks, etc.  Various software helps, including service management solutions.  We will talk about the latter now.

      Not to be unfounded, let's look at the benefits of such programs on a specific product.  Take for example the Tivoli Foundations software, which combines two boxed solutions from IBM Tivoli Foundations Service Manager and IBM Tivoli Foundations Application Manager.  One of them is responsible for the organization of technical support, and the other is for monitoring the IT infrastructure. <br><br>  Organization of technical support. <br><br>  Many companies have no solutions for organizing an effective technical support service.  There is only a telephone hotline technical support, supplemented by spreadsheets for searching and recording incidents.  Automation in such cases is extremely unreliable, and centralized registration is extremely rare.  Such companies suffer from the use of cumbersome and error-prone processes that jeopardize the effectiveness of customer support.  These companies do not use self-service and knowledge base management modules, which requires constant IT support and leads to an increase in IT costs.  And in the case of alternative open sources, their configuration and integration often require considerable time and resources when introducing new equipment and / or replacement. <br><br>  And here IBM Tivoli Foundations Service Manager can come to the rescue, a solution for organizing technical support services.  It provides the ability to organize technical support services using ITIL V3.0-based service request, incident and problem management processes.  In addition, it offers a wide range of functionalities that provide a single point of contact, automating the management of queries, incidents and problems. <br><br>  This solution allows you to reduce the costs of small and medium-sized businesses, optimizing the productivity of operating personnel with the help of built-in problem solving tools.  Having a self-help portal that uses embedded solutions to the most common problems provides end-users with their own and quick solutions to a problem without attracting additional employees.  The solution also provides opportunities to independently and quickly solve problems that arise, without attracting additional staff.  The remote diagnostics feature provides support staff with the ability to remotely connect to workstations to troubleshoot problems that arise, saving time and reducing costs, increasing customer satisfaction. <br><br>  Other distinguishing features: <br>  - dashboards that provide real-time viewing of performance indicators <br>  - finished content: workflow, templates, key performance indicators, queries and reports <br>  - user poll management tools <br>  - electronic bulletin board, which allows to inform users about the availability of critical IT services. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/548/f99/8c3/548f998c378c6f3e9185b167c23d4eb3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  IT Infrastructure Monitoring <br><br>  The lack of access to a common picture of business processes in many organizations to effectively monitor the state and availability of IT systems threatens the provision of quality customer service.  In addition, if necessary, the commissioning or replacement of new machines configuration and integration are burdensome and costly.  Monitoring the performance and utilization of systems and servers is usually done by sequentially checking the machines, which requires a lot of time and is costly.  To monitor the performance of systems often use open source or proprietary software.  Settings and integration take more time when commissioning and / or replacing new machines.  As a result, such monitoring becomes costly, time-consuming and error-prone, since additional labor costs are often required for troubleshooting. <br><br>  Solve such problems can only centralization.  The IBM Tivoli Foundations Application Manager solution can help.  It provides entry-level monitoring for growing companies that need the proper functionality provided by an easy-to-use and cost-effective solution.  The solution helps to focus on and control key indicators of availability and performance.  It is used to monitor systems (server, OS, database), applications (e-mail), networks and virtual infrastructure (VMware). <br><br>  It includes advanced monitoring policies, so customers can proactively and quickly identify and respond to problems and issues related to key applications ‚Äî even before critical failures of important applications and services.  A real-time view and a historical view enable customers to visualize and generate intelligent reports about the current work of the IT environment, as well as its work over time.  Costs and risks can be reduced by anticipating insufficient or excessive use of resources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ae2/75e/64e/ae275e64e3e5d4bf5bd58ca554f12b4f.gif" alt="image"><br><br>  This solution integrates with IBM Tivoli Foundations Service Manager, which enables full, end-to-end management of abnormal situations and problems. <br><br>  By the way, it takes about an hour to fully deploy Tivoli Foundations solutions. <br><br>  Thus, the service management software provides an opportunity ‚Äúin one window‚Äù to see all the processes occurring within the infrastructure, maintain the infrastructure in the required state through the execution policy, manage complex and growing infrastructures, while controlling costs and quality.  And for a particular business, the use of such software provides a number of interesting advantages: <br><br>  - improving the quality of services <br>  - fully integrated processes throughout the business <br>  - faster and more reliable service provision <br>  - improved efficiency and productivity <br>  - minimization of operational and other risks <br>  - reduced costs. <br><br>  To this you can add the advantages of Tivoli Foundations: easy and quick installation and configuration;  Minimum IT staffing requirements for installation and maintenance  simplified deployment improves return time and payback;  low price. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95039/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95039/</a></p>
