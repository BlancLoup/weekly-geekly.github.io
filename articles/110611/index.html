      The comp was going leisurely, as far as possible, from the middle of summer.  Now on the IXBT website a popular vote is being held - it is even interesting, in how many cases I have not lost my choice;) And now, if no one is against it, I will start. <br><br><h2>  Motherboard </h2><br>  It is necessary to start assembling a computer from the motherboard - without a ‚Äúmother‚Äù nowhere to go) The choice is extremely huge - there are many manufacturers, each has a huge model line ... What should you do in such cases?  In fact, nothing complicated.  The only thing you need is to decide on the tasks that you want to solve on a computer.  Write down the requirements on a piece of paper and select the model of devices that satisfy them and fit the budget.  So what is next?  And then we understand that all devices are so pretty, which is why the eyes run and it becomes difficult to make a choice.  The problem is solved simply - you need to try to find the flaws separately for each device and see with which of the found you can live and with what not.  This advice is ideal in many ‚Äúagonies of choice‚Äù, but in the case of motherboards there are quite a few unobvious things - it is not at all superfluous to read reviews, weigh ‚ÄúFOR and AGAINST‚Äù. <br><br>  In my tasks, or rather the requirements, it was not clear what - socket 1366 (only on it you can assemble a really powerful system, with a memory car and, if necessary, with a full-fledged SLI system), and then abstract ideas about the final product.  Namely, something technological (if you are engaged in further tester activity, you cannot do without a full set of the latest technologies), productive and promising (‚Äúfor growth‚Äù - so that the possibility of upgrade and support will not go away in six months) and ... yes, , everything.  In theory, with all sorts of third-party controllers, similar functionality could be obtained even on budget mothers, but I wanted at least everything at once, that is, out of the box - if you assemble an ‚Äúinteresting‚Äù system, then do it from beginning to end. <br><br>  The desire to assemble a system on water cooling helped me to finally decide on it - the evening after conversation with Max ( <b><a href="http://maddude.habrahabr.ru/">MadDude</a></b> ) and I realized that the least trouble would be in my way if I took something ‚Äúpurebred‚Äù (sometimes I‚Äôm willing to pay for dressing - nice when beautiful).  That is, such a fee, for which there are already various accessories - yes, the same fullcover-water blocks. Having talked with overclockers, the circle of "mothers" narrowed down to only three models, from which the most promising (in terms of price / quality ratio and availability of sane service) to me seemed <b>ASUS Rampage III Extreme</b> .  I had to give up other options for another reason - due to the lack of water blocks / Do not consider advertising, but in the end I stopped at ASUS who were close to me - they were very interested in the characteristics, availability of necessary components, design / color (for harmony with the case) and numerous positive reviews of people I know. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/717/fdb/889/717fdb889754998a97cd1305da5271e6.png"><br><br>  Luxury equipment, an excellent set of interfaces (four PCI-E 16x, one PCI-E 4x and PCI, 11xUSB, two of which are versions 3.0, 2xFireWire, 2xSATA 6Gb / s and 7xSATA 3Gb / s, one of which is powered by eSATA), many technologies and features, high-quality component base and, as a result, stable work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/4dc/b3e/479/4dcb3e479e180afd582e1ceb5f611722.jpg"><br><br>  I will not talk in detail about this motherboard - if you want, I will write separately, but later.  Let me just say that there are really no problems with it yet (t-t), and the accessories are not just there - you can even pick them up.  For example, the problem of overheating the chipset (which is found on some samples in which the factory thermal grease dried) was solved by installing the same fullcover-waterblock (for this mother there are several varieties for every taste), which went just perfect - almost sure which in other cases would have to seriously interfere with the file. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/707/c56/307/707c56307f3b2538bab00117975d9772.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/714/dbd/84b/714dbd84b0e58cc4c4f1cc58acba8a92.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4ce/a5d/65f/4cea5d65f7cd267c5cad6924f410667b.jpg"><br><br>  The only drawback so far is that there was only one USB connector on the board, to which wires are connected to bring the connectors to somewhere outside.  Accordingly, out of 4 ports on the front panel of the case, only 2 work for me - all other devices have to be connected to the back of the case (where there will be enough USB ports for all).  Who knows the easiest way to solve the problem? <br><br>  At that time, the price for the ‚Äúthird rampage‚Äù was a considerable 15 thousand, which, in principle, was competitive compared to the other models mentioned.  By the way, the opinion is mistaken that once I write on the blogs of Intel and ASUS, it means that I bathe in the ‚Äúiron‚Äù health baths, that I am given parts in packs and that I am not treating anyone so angry with huge discounts ... no, friends, I have with them all is not so that sometimes upsets himself.  The cobbler was without boots - he bought at Yulmart in the order of the general queue) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/490/294/6e5/4902946e5894b03ffdf064009990b189.jpg"><br><br>  But these are trifles - you will think, I did not eat for a couple of months ... but I collected what I wanted) <br><br><h2>  CPU </h2><br>  When a socket is defined, it remains to choose a processor for it - taking into account the tasks that are planned to be solved in the future.  Having looked at the list of processors compatible with a 1366 socket (and having written the prices opposite to the models interesting to me), I chose what was most accessible with the highest characteristics.  Simply put, there was enough money only for the <b><a href="http://ark.intel.com/Product.aspx%3Fid%3D41447">Intel Core i7-930</a></b> - everything that was higher than it was worth unreasonably expensive.  More, in principle, and was not required - the previous processor (similar in characteristics and price of Intel Core i7-860) was quite enough.  I looked through the magazine CHIP - every month they make a very useful and visual tablet with a rating of processors ... having looked at that, I finally made my choice.  So, 4 cores (Bloomfield; 45nm), a nominal clock frequency of 2800 MHz, 8 megabytes of L3 cache and a maximum power consumption of 130W - from now on I live with it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d09/bac/91a/d09bac91ad8f57a7db4431474a2c95ef.jpg"><br><br>  I took the usual OEM-version, which is sold, roughly speaking, in a bag - in this case there is a chance to buy a low-quality processor (for example, used, but carefully washed from the thermal paste).  But I don‚Äôt see any point in overpaying for the BOX version (inside which, besides the processor, they put a noisy cooler), the vast majority of users install alternative (more efficient) cooling systems.  So the advice is simple - if you are not sure, do not buy processors ‚Äúin bags‚Äù on every kind of ‚ÄúGorbushki‚Äù and ‚ÄúSovek‚Äù there - take them in a good wholesale and retail store, where you will be given documents that have at least some strength. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c3b/c3b/239/c3bc3b239a5b614ced0382873a094ca0.jpg"><br><br>  Looking ahead - at a temperature of 40-45 degrees (60-65 in the load), a pebble works fine at a frequency of 4200 MHz. <br><br><h2>  Video card </h2><br>  This component of the system is the most rapidly ‚Äúaging‚Äù - new vidyuhi appear like mushrooms after rain.  But in reality, they ‚Äúbecome obsolete‚Äù only conditionally - if not playing (namely, games are the main engine of progress), then the ‚Äúgolden mean‚Äù is enough for many users without the support of the latest directories and other goodies.  Nevertheless, I wanted the video card not to be a bottleneck of the system for a long time and to correspond in general with all the components.  That is, it was necessary to have a device with a perspective, which can be hidden once in the iron "chest" and forget about it all for a relatively long time. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f78/286/0a3/f782860a3cbb796396bc3b178ffbdbec.jpg"><br>  <i>Now this is my son's favorite game - I even had to buy a steering wheel)</i> <br><br>  Despite the more advantageous pricing policy of ATI products, I‚Äôm used to NVIDIA - I don‚Äôt know, it just happened that way.  At the moment, the flagship graphics cards of this company are GTX 580, but at the time of assembling the system (as it was at the end of the summer), there were no mention of them either.  Then the GTX 480 reigned, on which I decided to stop.  By the way, the choice then was not great at all - the 480s cost as the launch of the shuttle, and the entire range was presented by only two manufacturers, Leadtek and Zotac.  Moreover, the Zotac board was significantly more expensive, due to the slight factory overclocking (AMP version) and the fact that an alternative cooling system was installed on it.  I didn‚Äôt have to choose at all - if you still consider that to build a computer with a water-cooling system, I needed a reference design card. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1d3/b9e/b32/1d3b9eb32c36443d3baa70220d5d944b.jpg"><br><br>  The video card is a beauty, <b><a href="http://bit.ly/fpmf1x">Leadtek GeForce GTX 480</a></b> - initially this board takes up two slots - thanks to the cooling system, which with its entire look reminds me of a ‚Äúwaffle iron‚Äù.  But such devices are supposed to be big;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0a6/6cb/44b/0a66cb44b264884567b998611713664a.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/101/d51/6ec/101d516ec187f47033793137ce586b43.jpg"><br><br>  There is also a high power consumption - the manufacturer recommends using a power supply with a minimum power of 600W.  The presence of the miniHDMI connector seemed strange to me - it‚Äôs good that the adapter was included, but it‚Äôs not clear why you couldn‚Äôt use a full HDMI. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f78/730/139/f78730139d879e1f8a0c9dde2a89eb48.jpg"><br><br>  The rest - some pluses.  1536MB of 384-bit GDDR5 video memory (with a frequency of 1848 MHz - effective 3696 MHz), the frequency of the GPU / shader unit is 700/1401 MHz ... all this is already out of the box providing high performance, which is enough even for the most demanding games and applications.  The hardware support for physical calculations, the built-in sound chip are also a kind of advantages, although not so important. <br><br>  The calculation turned out to be true - the fullcover-waterblock perfectly stood up for the reference design, thanks to which the video card lost twice and began to work absolutely silently in a beautiful temperature mode.  And thanks to overclocking (about which just below), the performance of my Leadtek GeForce GTX 480 video card caught up with the flagship GTX 580 (without overclocking). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a3e/989/571/a3e989571adc1e93a7671a0192fadb9f.jpg"><br><br>  Visual plate with the characteristics of the main graphics processors: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e7/e6d/63a/8e7e6d63a2c135a56959364b3d434d20.png"><br><br>  Now the price of the GTX 480 has dropped to 13-14 thousand, which decently raised the "price / quality ratio".  GTX 580 is, in fact, "work on the bugs" (480, what would like to see it), but at the moment it is unreasonably expensive. <br><br><h2>  Power Supply </h2><br>  Many people do not attach much importance to this component, thinking that ‚Äúsince it does not affect performance, then why not sack off on it‚Äù is a fairly common mistake.  Despite the fact that many new motherboards are full of all kinds of protections (including ‚Äúfrom a fool‚Äù), there is always a chance to spoil the ‚Äúwrong power‚Äù of the entire system unit.  Therefore, a good power supply in expensive configurations should be required. <br>  The power supply directly didn‚Äôt really affect the performance at all, so I had only two requirements - so that it was modular (the extra wires always annoyed me), pulled all the installed hardware (and had a small margin to overclock or install additional components), while working as quiet as possible.  The option "choose BP by weight - the harder the better" is quite right to live, but manufacturers have gotten the hint and now almost all "serious" power supplies weigh decently) As such, the opportunity to "feel" (or at least listen) selected I did not have power supplies, so I agreed to the <b><a href="http://dedal.habrahabr.ru/">DeDaL</a></b> option ‚Äî to come and see what Thermaltake is offering. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5b6/310/ee3/5b6310ee331f80bb80b67d58665a2e12.jpg"><br><br>  He had about a dozen BP of different manufacturers on the table - as it turned out later, they were all killed by overclockers and he was picking on each of them out of interest.  With my ‚Äúsystem requirements,‚Äù he with a smile waved his hand and said, ‚ÄúI have something that will suit you just perfectly.‚Äù  After these words, Sarkis pulled a large black box from the shelf, in which there was a 750W <b>Thermaltake Toughpower Grand</b> who had seen the types of BP - it was he who repeatedly used as a ‚Äúbasis‚Äù for his overclocking feats. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/27b/1ad/3d1/27b1ad3d1381bbfe0b85a661038ff905.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a54/c6f/282/a54c6f282368e71238205c32edb08d1c.jpg"><br><br>  Initially, I planned to take something no less than a thousand, but DeDaL convinced me that 750 ‚Äúfrom Grand‚Äù is enough for my eyes.  The unit has a single + 12V line with a maximum load of 60A, which simply cannot be enough for modern reproduction processors and video cards.  A little later, in a black and black room, we connected a black and black power supply to a special test bench, which allows us to create any load for the power supply. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5db/2ae/a99/5db2aea9957af29234722310765beadd.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dff/46c/d4c/dff46cd4c3ffd9c42eb7a5380e52d8bf.jpg"><br><br>  Half an hour of stress test and excellent performance as a result - almost no heating (high-voltage wires were also cool) and the lack of "sagging" on all lines - a high level of efficiency gives everybody the right to wear the 80+ Gold label.  But what surprised me the most was the lack of noise from work even in load mode (despite the presence of a specially designed 140mm cooler; by the way, this cooler continues to spin for another 30 seconds, cooling the components heated during operation).  Hi-End in an explicit form - ranging from packaging and packaging, ending with excellent performance. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c26/18b/cfe/c2618bcfe114b924267d2fdb289f5296.jpg"><br><br>  The stylish appearance (in my case, it‚Äôs true, in the case will be extremely unnoticeable), an amazing package bundle - all this together I was completely satisfied and I didn‚Äôt even look for anything else anymore. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac8/48f/6df/ac848f6df6194254bfd1742f2ad1d79a.png"><br><br><h2>  RAM </h2><br>  This is where I‚Äôm not shuffling at all - for me all the timings for one person) and in everyday work the only problem of ‚Äúmemory‚Äù was that it was sometimes not enough.  So I just decided to take it a little more, for the start of gigs 6 - three strips of 2GB each.  Accordingly, three more strips can be put in the future, but so far this is not necessary. <br>  Here I fully relied on Vlad's taste ( <a href="http://slamms.habrahabr.ru/">slamms</a> ), which the <b>Crucial Ballistix Tracer Blue</b> (3x2GB, PC3-12800 1600MHz, 8-8-8-24) recommended to me. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3d6/2aa/5e1/3d62aa5e1b6bcb95dd29b24409c40270.jpg"><br><br>  I do not know why I listened to it :) Everything would be fine - the memory works fine ... but I found out that the bars are decorated with a scattering of LED indicators only after the purchase :) Maybe someone would like light music and like it, but for me was an unpleasant surprise. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6a/cca/46a/f6acca46a7593f2d43f46bea627649b1.jpg"><br><br>  I <a href="">bought the</a> memory (and the processor) at the Just store - unfortunately, they refused to change the memory for this ‚Äúreason‚Äù.  Maybe they are right, but for me it was the last straw for the final withdrawal from buying something in this store.  From now on, I fiercely recommend everyone to <a href="http://www.ulmart.ru/">Yulmart</a> - that's where the good service, range and prices are (it's a pity that then this memory was simply not there).  I don‚Äôt know how it is with the ‚Äúreturn‚Äù, but apparently, thousands of hamsters cannot be mistaken (my Twitter <a href="http://twtpoll.com/r/zcr9xf">poll</a> gave similar results): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e02/e77/9a5/e02e779a5dd769ba23e23a24c99d42cb.png"><br><br>  It is good that the light from the LEDs almost does not extend beyond the enclosure.  But I don‚Äôt know what to do next - either take three more of the same slats (then it will definitely be light), or take six slats of the well-proven Kingston (which will be more expensive).  In general, while I have what I have - 6GB is enough for my tasks. <br><br><h2>  HDD </h2><br>  The fact that as the basis will be the SSD-drive, I had no doubt - they are very attractive in many ways.  For example, high speed, noiselessness and low temperature (mechanical strength and low power consumption in my case were not fundamental).  There are also disadvantages (high price, small volume, potentially ‚Äúsmall‚Äù resource), but where they are not in our time. <br>  Data is not so bad to lose in the event that you make backups - the most important thing for me, it seems, is saved.  A small amount ... well, yes, there is such a thing, but the SSD is not bought for storing HD movies - a small volume should be enough for the system.  So, by and large, everything came up against the price and then I decided to follow the simple path - to take the ‚Äúmiddle ground‚Äù.  This middle was the 128GB <b><a href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx%3Fid%3D90">WD SiliconEdge Blue</a></b> storage device (built on the MLC memory, on the JMicron 612 controller), which cost ‚Äúonly‚Äù 8500 rubles - for this money, competitors offer only 80 GB models (in particular, the mainstream X25-M from Intel and a similar model from Kingston - the rest I did not even look). <br><br>  What is he good at?  Well, first of all, the volume - any software will fit on 128GB and even remain.  Good read and write speeds are 250 and 170 MB / s, respectively (in theory).  NCQ support and TRIM teams - it‚Äôs probably meaningless to take a disk without them.  Well, what else do you need from the disk?  In general, he took without hesitation.  Although no - this <a href="http://www.fcenter.ru/online.shtml%3Farticles/hardware/hdd/28917">comparative test</a> still made a useful contribution when choosing;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fbd/819/eaa/fbd819eaa5d7ab3e24407c1a78b52eb4.jpg"><br><br>  As for the service life, the manufacturer promises a time between failures of about 1,400,000 hours, which, when recalculated in a year, gives a greater figure.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Of course, this figure cannot be trusted anyway - there are a lot of different factors here ... and it‚Äôs good if the disc works for at least a couple of years) But I don‚Äôt want to lose even the saved data, therefore, on the advice of a friend, I decided to do the following.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As you know, SSD-drives operate with data blocks of 4Kb - this does not cause any inconvenience during recording, however, page-by-page (4Kb) deletion during data deletion is impossible - you can reset only 512Kb sector. And since 512Kb is not necessarily part of a single file, before deleting the "unnecessary" disk, you will have to once again do operations to move the "necessary" parts of the files to other areas of the drive. It is easy to guess that the greatest harm from such movements will be when the available volume is full - even if there is support for TRIM, the data will simply have nowhere to move. Because of the convulsive movements of tiny amounts of data, the disk will do a lot of unnecessary read-write operations, which, following logic, is the right way to ruin the resource of the drive - to defragment it is not an option here:) To avoid this unpleasant picture, I created a section of only 110 GB of the available 128 ‚Äî all other memory cells at the physical level will always be available so that data can be moved to them.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ffa/e68/5cd/ffae685cd568bd7c4258e3f955b0e1d4.png"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Since I considered only Windows 7 as an OS, I didn‚Äôt take any additional actions during the installation of the system - unless I turned off a couple of extra services after installation.

All is good, but the connecting wires of the coolers are very short and ugly.  The problem was solved quite simply - Noctua coolers (which in the amount of three pieces were on my previous computer) had extremely long ‚Äútails‚Äù in a practical and beautiful ‚Äúskin‚Äù - if earlier I didn‚Äôt know how to hide them prettier, now they are the other way around. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9fc/d0d/5fb/9fcd0d5fbe31375b6603058a50264542.jpg"><br><br>  Cheap soldering iron, side cutters, half an hour of time ... and now all six coolers are soldered, each with a wire of the desired length;) On the radiator, I found a small chute into which previously hung wires fit perfectly. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/01e/a59/2a0/01ea592a002487c72f3da3a53cba3c12.jpg"><br><br>  In order to dismantle the entire cooling system (it was not for nothing that the quick-release valves and mounting bracket were installed), the connectors for powering all the coolers were brought out through the cuts in one of the body plugs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/973/3a3/f9e/9733a3f9eb3953339c667bf10ba042cc.jpg"><br><br>  Now it is enough to disconnect the wires, turn the tubes and press the bracket - and now the body is ready even for the most severe transportation.  As a result, it was still not as beautiful as I would like (I will work on it when I have more time), but much better than it was. <br><br>  What else was used in the system unit?  Yes, in principle, nothing more - the first BluRay-drive (for six months they never used it) and the discrete sound card <b>ASUS Xonar HDAV 1.3 Deluxe</b> (originally was ASUS Xonar Essence ST, but it didn't work out) - I don‚Äôt think what is now worth a separate talk about these non-core things. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/e58/8e4/5d2/e588e45d291cad4e70287cb61300bf50.jpg"><br><br><h2>  Overclocking </h2><br>  Such systems are not going to just to please the eye - a profit should be in everything.  Including the performance, which is still out of the box at a very good level. <br><br>  I admit at once that I am far from a guru in overclocking, although I have always been interested in this subject.  I tried to do something myself - it seemed to be possible, but I could not get rid of the understanding that this was not the limit at all.  And I was a little afraid to do something further - most of all I didn‚Äôt want to disable the new system ... I think this is one of the most frequent factors stopping many newcomers.  So one evening, the same funny guy DeDaL came to visit me - in my opinion, this is the third person from Habr who was on my balcony) In between conversations, he told me the basics, along the way, the potential for overclocking .  There was no task to set a record or make the computer work in extreme conditions - I wanted ‚Äúa reasonable maximum in the framework of stable work‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ede/55b/b64/ede55bb6473d271d60e52266933566ad.jpg"><br><br>  First of all, Sarkis studied the NWO and what I did with the body - I approved it in general) Then we immediately got down to business.  The latest BIOS was downloaded to the motherboard, which was successfully requested. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/390/af2/201/390af22013fde869614ed9e4aa4b9ca0.jpg"><br><br>  ASUS has a lot of interesting overclocking tools ( <b>ASUS Turbo EVO</b> and <b>PC PROBE II</b> ) and control of the overclocked system (ROG Connect allows you to connect a smartphone or laptop and edit all the parameters from it).  But it is more interesting to pick it all up manually, so we climb into the BIOS - there it‚Äôs worth starting with turning off all energy saving features and other green features.  Reboot - everything works. <br><br>  We go to the <b>ASUS Extreme Tweaker</b> - in this section of the BIOS is all that relates to overclocking.  A good ‚Äúceiling on the water‚Äù of the first versions of the Intel Core i7-930 processor was about 4600+ MHz (with factory 2800) - now these figures can be quite difficult to achieve.  We decided to limit to 4200 MHz (21 * 200 MHz; despite the maximum multiplier of 22, Sarkis advised using an odd multiplier) - at this frequency all voltages were more or less within reasonable limits and allowed to work stably for a long time.  Additional megahertz people would hardly have made the weather - they would have had to aggressively increase the voltage, and this would no longer be desirable.  The settings are as follows: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8e8/3f4/e7e/8e83f4e7ed9b2bc3a1759e9614d8c77b.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/221/af8/912/221af89123760c3307a1e54b1017eae4.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ad8/078/a8e/ad8078a8e854b9674862e9bf915cbdb7.jpg"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/43d/395/79c/43d39579c7e4d6a7ded852030fd07fca.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fd0/92b/7e6/fd092b7e6f34503b00f472a65a6589f6.jpg"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bea/549/961/bea54996150b9b96b7909fc4f688968f.jpg"></a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fa6/c5f/b94/fa6c5fb94ae25b2baa518b922be1a3bb.jpg"><br><br>  All settings were saved in a separate OC-profile of the BIOS, which at any time allows you to switch between them - I wanted to save energy - I chose the most economical mode;  I wanted to pay for electricity - I chose the profile ‚ÄúDeDaL‚Äù and began to increase uptime;) By the way, the CPU consumption in the maximum mode is negligible compared to how much the video card eats ... so you should not worry too much about it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/127/bd9/8fb/127bd98fbe64a9e5233a98a2abba7a26.jpg"><br><br>  It is noteworthy that the version CPU-Z from version to version surprises with its readings.  Here, for example, two windows - pay attention to nuclear voltage) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8c1/ead/1a1/8c1ead1a11dcf7b3ef0852b6dfe4fe84.png"><br><br>  The temperature mode is normal - at 100% load of a 4.2 GHz processor, the temperature on the cores did not exceed 68 degrees.  And in the mode of the usual "office" work modest 40-45 degrees.  Thus, the overclocking of the processor was neither more nor less than 50%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/728/8d4/a75/7288d4a75fd8bb332001b865b1c22abb.png"><br><br>  The video card is also a little tortured.  Alternatively, you could use the functional <b>MSI Afterburner</b> , which allows you to change the voltage on the core, but I suggested that DeDaL use the good old <b>EVGA Precision</b> - this is a similar program in functions, the only difference from which is the MSI utility is the inability to change the voltage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/884/c7e/8dc/884c7e8dc3424c360a8d439f48666a1e.png"><br><br>  At this stage, the benchmark from <b>3DMark</b> and <b>Furmark</b> also came in handy, which revealed the stability of work and temperature.  The nominal core / shader / memory frequencies of the Leadtek GeForce GTX 480 are 700/1400/1848 MHz - the limit we needed was found almost immediately and amounted to 820/1640/2100 MHz, respectively.  If my memory serves me correctly, the video card worked at frequencies up to 880 MHz on the core, but in this case there was no stability - in the middle of the test, the image on the screen became artifacts.  Therefore, we gradually ‚Äúpassed back‚Äù until overclocking under load conditions ceased to be a detriment to stability.  This means that in more benign modes, the video card should work just as well, which it actually does.  The temperature of the GPU in the load rose from 44 degrees to 58 - a very good indicator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/86c/eb1/eac/86ceb1eac07a3e95d1c3684260aaf378.png"><br><br>  In this mode, the performance of my GTX 480 on tests caught up with the flagship model GTX 580 (without overclocking) - and you ask, why do overclocking;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/89f/f36/a7b/89ff36a7bbe52021c412752bcfb90251.jpg"><br>  <i>The number of "bagels" in this test from 3DMark means the number of cores (including HT)</i> <br><br>  The abstract performance index during overclocking also slightly increased - in terms of memory and processor.  <a href="">It was</a> and became: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/aca/8d5/6b7/aca8d56b765f1f572e00ce0645e0cc07.png"><br><br>  I agree that the figures obtained are far from the records, but I repeat that no such goal was set.
