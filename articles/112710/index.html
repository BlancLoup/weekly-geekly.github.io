Dangerous post.  On Habr√© many who are engaged and lives SEO.  Actually, I'm not even against SEO.  This is a useful and necessary direction.  How without him quickly to bring the new site to some position is not at all clear.  But the trouble is that in pursuit of the number of links and the uniqueness of the content, the very meaning of the concept of ‚Äúpromoting the customer‚Äôs site‚Äù is somehow lost. <br><br>  Users of SEO services, remember that the result is estimated by the number of customers listed, and not by the number of visits per site.  Often these are perpendicular characteristics.  Do not let us completely fill your head with ratings, links, uniqueness and other things.  Often what the SEO company offers is convenient, simple in execution and beneficial to itself, and not to the customer at all.  Do not give them full.  Be prudent and make sure that promotion consists of reasonable actions, not semi-mechanical actions. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      One of the things everyone is crazy about is the unique texts on the sites.  It comes to absurd things.  So one friend complained to me that he was assigned to create a unique table of abbreviations.  And this is a table of the form: "X is the voltage of such a node in volts."  I find it funny, sad for him.  I could not resist the advice to write in the spirit: <br><ul><li>  voltage, Volt </li><li>  voltage in volts </li><li>  voltage which is measured in volts </li><li>  Volts, which are measured by the "voltage meter" ... </li></ul><br>  I will reveal the great simple truth.  To promote the company's products, the uniqueness of the texts is not at all mandatory.  Yes, it is not the site, and the company.  The real goal of promotion is to increase the number of sales or the number of customers.  The site is one of the ways to attract them, and not an end in itself. <br><br>  The uniqueness of the texts has nothing to do with the increase in sales.  These are internal SEO games.  A good article about your product / service on a good foreign site is much more useful than 10 ‚Äúgovnostaty‚Äù on your own.  Another thing is that it is difficult to track the effect of such an article, and there is no qualification to write it.  Therefore, it is rewritten several times by the same thing in different words. <br><br>  Say, there was a connoisseur here ... Yes.  I consider myself a good SEO.  I promote my site very well, although I have not bought a single link in my life, I have not ordered a newsletter and have not created a network of Sattelite websites. <br><br>  I just write good articles and publish them.  I care about the reader, not the number of keywords.  And my articles are reading.  I do not care, read my article on the Intel site, on Habr√© or native viva64.com.  Pay attention to this.  I do not care about the uniqueness!  Of course, Google will give preference to the Intel site when searching.  Well, let.  It's pointless to be ranked with him by rating.  Let my article read there.  In it, I wrote an interesting new information, told about myself.  And sooner or later they will come and buy from this article. <br><br>  Where is the uniqueness of the content?  And why is she?  Why protect her?  On the contrary, I am even happy when someone takes and publishes my article on another site.  Of course, I'm not talking about the cases when a robot takes an article, cram keywords into it, and places it somewhere to feed search engines.  But it is not scary.  A living real person will not read such a text anyway, but will find its original if he is interested in this subject. <br><br>  Do not forget that the value of the article is still, first of all, determined by its content, and not by its uniqueness.  Do not forget about it and occasionally look around with a fresh head.  The world offers more options than anyone trying to convince you.  And that is why I consider myself to be a good SEO, because I am not obsessed with any generally accepted promotion templates. <br><br>  I consider my colleague ( <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/evgeniyryzhkov/" class="user_link">EvgeniyRyzhkov</a> ) to be no less talented SEO person than myself.  On these New Year's holidays, he suddenly wanted to go for a few days to a sanatorium near the city of Aleksin to go skiing.  Of course, all the places have already been dismantled.  Well, more precisely, not quite everything, but the latter are reserved for unexpectedly good and necessary people.  My colleague wrote an e-mail to the director of this sanatorium and approximately the following dialogue occurred between them in the mail: <br><br>  K - Colleague <br><br>  D - Director of the sanatorium <br><br>  K: And let you still find a free number for me, and I will give you advice on how to significantly increase the number of calls from visitors to your site. <br><br>  D: Well, yes, we all know all these tips.  Pay more for banners or even website advertising on TV on Channel One.  Eh .. <br><br>  K: No.  What I say will not require any additional investment from you and will take 10 minutes to complete. <br><br>  D: Well, let's try.  What should we do? <br><br>  K: You have the phone number on all pages of the site with the wrong city code. <br><br>  Number my colleague received.  And thanks at the same time.  Now the question.  Who is better SEO-Schnick, he or those who are engaged in the promotion of the site of the sanatorium? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/112710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/112710/</a></p>
