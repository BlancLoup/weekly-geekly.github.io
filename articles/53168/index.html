  <section class="page js-page"><h1>In the order of things</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, my name is Ruslan Madzhitov, and I have seven years of experience in e-commerce. <br>  During this time, I managed to work on myself and on a large Internet holding.  You can read about my experience in <a href="http://ruslan-madzhitov.moikrug.ru/">my circle</a> .  It was then that I was completely disillusioned with how e-commerce is developing in RuNet and how far it is from modern trends and ‚Äúsociality‚Äù, and, more simply, human relations with customers, not to mention the forms of marketing that they use. <br><br>  I don‚Äôt like how traditional marketing works based on mind manipulation, and I had a dream to make such a project where people could discuss not only the things that are on sale, but also those that people have and share their impressions and knowledge of these things. <br><br>  I really want me to have the opportunity to choose what I need to buy, based not on ‚Äúsales hits‚Äù and not ‚Äútechnical specifications‚Äù, but on user characteristics ‚Äî those characteristics and features that are really important to me.  Therefore, I decided to make a project about things where the user himself determines what he likes and what characteristics are key for him.  And a place where it will be possible to build as much as possible, to the extent possible, an open and ‚Äútransparent‚Äù dialogue with sellers.  And I left the post of head of marketing - to make such a project. <br>  What I did was <a href="http://www.yagoodza.ru/">Yaguza</a> . <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://yagoodza.ru/images/logo.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Yaguza is a project about things, about their place in our life, about our attitude towards them. <br>  Yaguza is a place where interesting people meet and discuss interesting things.  Interesting to each other. <br>  Here you can consult on the subject of purchase, gift and everything else in the world.  You can share your experience with others.  You can find people who share your tastes. 
      <br>

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      And you can become a seller.  Vendors on Yagudze hold contests, provide discounts, and you will first learn about new things.  We do not connect everyone, but only those who are anxious about their business - they love and appreciate Yagodza users. <br>  Sellers can recommend and share with others the experience of communicating with the seller. <br>  Everyone can try to become a seller and please others with unusual and unique things. <br><br>  How does all this work out? <br>  On Yagudz you can create various lists of things: which you have, which you dream of, or just interesting things.  To the new user, we offer by default several of the most common lists, but you can create any list and combine everything in it.  Subject lists are limited only by your imagination. <br>  Things in lists can be added not only manually, but also in a quick way - with the help of a link.  So far, you can only use Yandex.Market, Ozon and Bolero links - but we are not going to dwell on this, and we want to make it so that you can add things from almost any site where you find an interesting thing. <br><br>  Lists can be discussed, add comments to each thing, share their knowledge about them.  Look at the <a href="http://www.yagoodza.ru/list/1426/">list of</a> various famous brands, to each of which the history of its creation and development has been added: Coca Cola, Apple and even simple Soviet condensed milk.  Interesting?  Surely you also have something to share with others. <br><br>  We have a <a href="http://www.yagoodza.ru/feed/posts/">blog</a> in which we regularly highlight the most interesting lists and the most unusual things.  Here you can also express your opinion about the project - we are always glad to have a dialogue with you. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://yagoodza.ru/images/screenshot.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  And there is a sign - if you create a wish list on Yagudz, then they will come true :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/53168/">https://habr.com/ru/post/53168/</a></p>
