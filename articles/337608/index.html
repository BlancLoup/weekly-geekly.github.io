I waited until he came out and tracked down his lair.  Played with him a bit.  Then the demon disappeared, as usual, on schedule - at 9.00.  I calmed down and took up my household chores. </p><br><p>  The fact was that in St. Petersburg we didn‚Äôt find an English workbook, Planet of Knowledge, in Grade 3, in bookstores.  Well, as in the Union was, the deficit.  And my wife gave me a task - to go to the bookstores in Moscow.  Say, in the capital, everything is there, my aunt on the forum from there order, pay 500 rubles for delivery, and you, taking the opportunity, buy it yourself and save for the family.  At least some sense from the loser will be.  I turn on Google map, ask the phrase "bookstores" and do not understand.  Neither the Red Square, nor the river, any strange streets. </p><br><p>  Heck!  He got out again!  After all, I still managed only to reach Barbara. </p><br><p>  And, obeying the call of nature, I again uncovered my weapon. </p><a name="habracut"></a><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Epigraph</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><p>  <em>Every hunter wants to know where the pheasant sits.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Folk memory in physics</em> <em><br></em> <br>  <em>It seems to us even pleasant to be frightened.</em>  <em>Not because fear warns us of a real danger or prompts to take some action against it, but because it makes our experience unusually intense.</em> <em><br></em>  <em>Corey Robin.</em>  <em>"Fear. A History of Political Idea"</em> <em><br></em> </p></div></div><br><p>  While uncovering - I think so. </p><br><p>  After all, he, the dog, prevents me from living, fulfilling simple household needs.  And all these tourists who rise from China-city to the square also interfere.  And those guys who got into an accident on the Kremlin embankment also get in the way.  And runners, and taxi drivers, and their passengers.  And many more people I didn‚Äôt remember.  And who in Russia is responsible for the radio frequencies?  That everything was clean, without interference.  It seems the HRCH is called the Main Radiofrequency Center.  And he has a website - <a href="http://www.grfc.ru/grfc/"></a>  <a href="http://www.grfc.ru/grfc/">http://www.grfc.ru/grfc/</a> .  And after all, he may, by a mass complaint, for example, of people on the Internet, check for the presence of a demon and find him, but he does not.  Well, as the president will ask on the next straight line, who is this nightmare of its population.  But I can understand these Radiofrequency Centers.  They have a powerful event on their nose in a good place, in nature - <a href="http://spectr-forum.com/">Spectrum Forum</a> .  Velvet season, holiday romance and all that.  They will discuss the purity of the spectrum there and with new forces for work.  Eh, where are my sixteen years ... </p><br><p>  But I will not wait for them and I will uncover them anyway, since adrenaline is already going off scale. <br>  Where can I still catch a living demon if not in my homeland?  Here we take Europe - boring live, poor fellows.  Satisfied, one might say, rubber demons, the good are <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/320206/">inexpensive</a> .  The real ones don't walk around the streets like that.  And if they do, they quickly and hiding so that God forbid they do not notice. </p><br><p>  My weapon looks like this: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/515/eab/cb0/515eabcb03534b018173b1bba6d2f04f.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  You can read about its internal structure in my <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/332746/">previous article</a> . </p><br><p>  Now I just have to tell you about the cable.  It seems inconspicuous in appearance, but it runs as much as 5 GHz. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/941/fd9/ed1/941fd9ed158545a4909d472f7f8f7b61.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  The direction finder connects to the tablet via USB3, and its cable quality requirements are quite serious.  Fortunately, the cable I have to be not very long, I take pieces of a simple twisted pair UTP and connect the connector type A with the connector type C. On the direction finder there is type C, since the thickness cannot be greatly increased, it will be ugly.  It turns out that such a twist of all colors of the rainbow.  And most importantly - you need to add some more earth wires to this twist.  With one, for example, even at such a length, the USB interface gives errors and there is no connection with the board. </p><br><p>  On side A, it's very simple. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/8a3/3c1/ba5/8a33c1ba5bb74f9d85f222aa51906176.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  And on the C side, we also need a resistor (according to the type C standard), which I did not find in the SMD format, so I installed a large Soviet one.  This is how sometimes the old stocks of our fathers are saved! </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/285/541/1bf/2855411bf50c4d678588a5052b366470.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  Let us return to our ward until you are completely bored.  Different mobile devices react to the daemon strongly in different ways.  I had Samsung Duos and Lenovo Phab 2 Pro on my hands (the star of future articles about AR-direction finders).  Samsung, even in the vicinity of the demon rarely flew to Vnukovo.  He simply could not find a navigation solution.  Its GPSTest screen looked like this: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/98b/10d/b48/98b10db48ac54d3688202afaf22c38ad.jpg" alt="image"></p><br><p>  It is especially noteworthy that the SNR value of about 50 dB on this smartphone does not exist in principle.  Losses in the antenna of this device lead to a fairly large system noise figure (System Noise Floor).  With the open sky, I saw only 40 dB with a little.  And this is one of the signs of the demon coming, observed on ordinary mobile devices. </p><br><p>  It should also be noted that, along with fake satellites, these are also accepted.  They have a significantly lower SNR.  The right-hand screenshot was taken under the Moskvoretsky bridge, so there is only one real satellite there, but the rest (fake) are taken as if they were all in my pocket. </p><br><p>  But a newer gadget - Lenovo Phab 2 Pro shows Vnukovo stupidly: </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ae8/adb/eb0/ae8adbeb000d481f910046a0534624be.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  This is the gadget I put in Moscow SIMK and planned to navigate normally in Moscow.  But ... </p><br><p>  Let's look at the spectrum of the demon.  Below in the video you will see it on the right vertically.  I unfolded the picture to make it clearer. </p><br><p><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/ae7/412/0f6/ae74120f63ee4ab690b469a7d78fedf6.png" alt="image"></p><br><p>  First, there is <del>  demon horn </del>  the central harmonic signal, which, apparently, should clog the receivers so that they are worse received by real satellites.  Below is 20 dB already <del>  demon's body </del>  wide signal that simulates satellite. </p><br><p>  I feel that you have already warmed up enough, let's get down to the main course.  Since the direction finder is built on augmented reality, I suggest just watching a couple of videos from the battlefield. </p><br><p>  At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DYRmIs84KVT8">first,</a> I go down the Zaryadie park, which is washed away from construction mud.  That's why my shoes are so dirty. </p><br><p>  On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dyiy2Mt79M1c">second,</a> I walk along the Kremlin Embankment. </p><br><p>  I carefully read the article on <a href="https://meduza.io/feature/2016/10/19/teleportatsiya-iz-kremlya-vo-vnukovo-pochemu-gps-navigatsiya-v-tsentre-moskvy-rabotaet-so-sboyami">Medusa</a> and I see no reason not to believe the authors.  Once colleagues found the demon there, it means he was there. </p><br><p>  He just moved. </p><br><p>  PS <br>  Maybe my Phab 2 Pro is so frozen, but I saw that the demon disappeared only at 10.30, exactly.  And it was already near the Neux Hackspace on Khokhlovsky.  I am surprised and indignant, how far he beats.  What for?  I also suspect the demon of formalism.  Why does it turn on and off at times that are multiples of an hour or half an hour?  All this is not good.  Demon, you should take care of the population. </p></div>
