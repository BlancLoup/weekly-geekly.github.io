At that time, Andy Rubin, Rich Miner, Nick Sears, and Chris White ‚Äî people from the telecommunications giants (Dander, Wildfire, T-Mobile, WebTV) ‚Äîfound a mobile application development startup. <br>  The newly minted company was given the name Android. <br>  Two years later, in July 2005, Google notices the company and buys it for an undeclared amount.  The founders continue to work in Android Inc., but already under the control of the Internet giant. <br>  David Lowe, Google‚Äôs vice president of corporate development, called this purchase ‚Äúthe best Google deal.‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Development and release </h4><br>  In early November 2007, Google announced the creation of its own open source mobile system called Android. <br>  At the same time, the Open Handset Alliance was established, including companies such as Google, HTC, Intel, Motorola, Qualcomm, Samsung, LG, T-Mobile, Nvidia, Wind River Systems and others.  The goal of the alliance is to develop open standards for mobile devices. <br>  Already on the 12th, the first version of the Android SDK (m3-rc20a) was released, and Google next announced the Android Developer Challenge with a prize fund of $ 10 million.  The task of the competition is to create your favorite mobile application.  The events took place in 2008 and ended with the awarding of 50 finalists with large cash prizes ($ 25-275 thousand).

      On September 23, 2008, the Android SDK 1.0 r1 is released, and a month later, the Open Handset Alliance published the source code for the Android system. <br>  The release includes the operating system, middleware, and main end applications written in Java.  The total amount of Android source code was 2.1 GB. <br>  The ‚Äúpreferred license‚Äù for Android source code is the Apache License 2.0. <br>  The source code for the Android platform is available at source.android.com <br>  The next day, the first smartphone working on the Android 1.0 operating system ‚ÄúApplebread‚Äù (apple pie) went on sale. <br>  The system was based on the Linux 2.6.25 kernel.  The device was manufactured by HTC and was named T-Mobile G1 (HTC Dream). <br>  Also on this day, it was announced the opening of the Android Market - Google's online app store. <br><br><h4>  Company problems </h4><br>  Not without problems.  In October 2010, Oracle sued Google.  Oracle lawyers argued that the source code for Android contained proprietary Oracle elements, and demanded $ 2.6 billion in damages. <br>  After several hearings, the court ruled to review the amount of compensation, indicating a starting point of $ 100 million. <br>  Later, Google representatives appealed to the US Department of Commerce Agency (USPTO), asking them to reconsider the claims of the software giant. <br>  And it seems that the attempt was quite successful: during the re-examination, the USPTO rejected 17 of the 21 patent claims.  A court hearing, which may close this matter, is scheduled for October 2011. <br>  In the same month, Steve Jobs accused Android of "fragmentation."  According to him, too many devices work on Android, this is a brake on application development for this OS. <br><br><h4>  Android today </h4><br>  In early 2011, the third Android version, Honeycomb, was announced.  Released February 22.  The system is focused on tablets. <br>  With version 3.1, it became possible to connect peripheral USB devices. <br>  The interface has been completely redesigned, it has become more suitable for large screens. <br><br>  But the future does not stand still, and now on May 10, 2011 at the Google I / O 2011 conference, the release of the Android 4.0 system was announced. <br>  Of the known changes, it should be noted that version 4.0 will be supported for tablets, for communicators, and for other Android devices. <br>  Also announced the optimization of the system for multi-core systems. <br><br><h4>  It is interesting </h4><br>  And at the end of the article - interesting facts: <br><ul><li>  In early 2011, the number of applications exceeded 200 thousand </li><li>  Android users on average are men, most often young - 75%, 54% are under the age of 35;  55 years and older - 8%. </li><li>  More than 150 million activations of devices based on Android OS have already happened </li><li>  Each version of the system is named after a dessert. </li></ul><br><br>  <i>I thank you for reading the article.</i>  <i>Hope you enjoyed it.</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/979/7eb/c50/9797ebc500493e42698c2861a0b6d665.png" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/127896/">https://habr.com/ru/post/127896/</a></p>
