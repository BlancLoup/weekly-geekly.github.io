  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HTC One S - the perfect balance</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The new HTC smartphones were rumored long before their official appearance at the MWC 2012. All sorts of different "Edge", "Endeavor", "Willy" and other new devices leaked into the Network eventually merged into one line called One.  So now we have three gadgets with different characteristics: One X, One S and One V and, accordingly, different prices.  The most expensive and uncompromising, purely geeky X costs 29990, the youngest V (attention!) Is 14990 - here HTC tried and made the price tag very humane, and the most balanced S, which will be discussed below, costs 24990. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/5ee/fa0/0fc/5eefa00fcc3717704c43f8ef51088644.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Design </h4><br>  New smart at the same time and looks like everything that the company did before, and does not look like.  HTC can be understood: on the one hand, it is necessary to preserve the design's succession, and on the other - to move into the bright future of diversity.  In One S, Desire‚Äôs features are visible, but not to the extent that they can be confused.  The main differences are the thickness of the case and the front panel.  At first, it seemed to me that the all-metal Esca somehow uncomfortably lay in my hand - it was so thin and flat.  But this is a fee for progress, so I had to get used to it in a couple of days.  But the front panel like immediately.  The move with the flow of black glossy border of the screen in the sidewalls, in my opinion, is simply gorgeous.

In the black model, it is red, and in the silver - blue. <br><br>  In addition, it is worth noting the speaker grilles, made in the same style.  HTC used to make them ‚Äúchrome-plated‚Äù, and now it's just a perforation in the case.  Minimalist and elegant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d40/978/863/d409788632dd9be9ed6aa04ea68315fe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Another important point regarding the case is scratch-resistant coating.  With One S, you can show tricks to friends.  We take ... well, for example, a fork.  We hold on the back and show all four obvious bands.  We do not listen to exclamations like ‚ÄúYes, he is stubborn!  Scratch a gadget for 25 pieces! ‚ÄùJust wipe the surface with something, and there were no scratches.  With a fork, I am exaggerating a little, but with the keys in one pocket I carried the smartphone constantly, and nothing.  A little rub it, and as good as new.  The only question is, how much coverage is enough?  :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0ab/67f/351/0ab67f351035f3fdf16254fdc54468ba.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And the last thing worth noting is the lack of silver letters in the logo.  This time it is simply engraved in the case, so you can not be afraid of the prospects of walking with a TC or HT phone.  And then I had precedents. <br><br><h4>  Display </h4><br>  HTC decided to finally embed Super AMOLED matrix into its smartphone.  Its diagonal is 4.3 inches, and the resolution is 960 by 540 pixels.  Another killer argument in favor of One S when choosing between it and its competitors.  And it is interesting that, for example, the SLCD-2 screen is installed in the older model, which, for all its merits, still doesn‚Äôt reach the displays based on organic light-emitting diodes. <br><br>  As for the One S, all expectations were confirmed.  Super AMOLED gives an excellent bright (in some places even too) picture, it remains quite readable in the bright sun (the sponsor of direct rays finally comes spring :) and provides close to maximum viewing angles. <br><br><h4>  Iron </h4><br>  The gadget is based on the Qualcomm MSM8260A chipset, which includes a dual-core ARM-processor with a clock speed of 1.5 GHz and the Krait architecture, Adreno 225 video chip, a gigabyte of RAM and 16 GB of main memory.  There is no memory card slot, and 16 GB is by this measure quite a bit, so HTC has entered into an agreement with Dropbox, where each user of One devices is given a couple dozen free gigabytes. <br><br>  The slot for the SIM format is micro, so before buying you should take care of cutting or changing the card from the operator beforehand, and it looks like the phone is already in the hands, but it will not work. <br><br>  Naturally, there are all the necessary wireless communication modules.  Wi-Fi supports standard n and streaming DLNA.  Bluetooth version 4.0, which does not increase the speed of data transmission, but it reduces power consumption. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/142/e48/28b/142e4828b23ce37127a5258045011358.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>HTC One S results in Quadrant test</i> <br><br><h4>  Camera </h4><br>  Now the camera is something that HTC can finally be proud of, because  Photos turn out really gorgeous!  The aperture of the F / 2.0 and the backlight of the sensor seem to hint to us that there is more light on the matrix, which means less noise in the dark, and with sufficient illumination, the pictures come out very bright and saturated. <br><br>  The resolution of the sensor is 8 megapixels, autofocus available, plus an LED flash with intelligent automatic control, which evaluates the level of illumination of the scene, the distance to the object and almost does not give overexposure.  To start a serial shooting, you do not need to climb in any settings, you just need to hold your finger on the shutter button - the gadget will start chirping it like a machine gun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/df4/630/0ac/df46300acfca9b4c33a913628509b66e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">Joyful journalists at the presentation of HTC One in full resolution.</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8fd/c04/3e8/8fdc043e8eb0df596005b233be61822e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">HTC One S camera filters in full resolution.</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5ba/d06/502/5bad06502e1aa5a2ef1f3b9050604ba6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">Sawn new iPad in full resolution.</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b8b/46d/9df/b8b46d9df7d8e584079b8fd4b9994203.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">Soy sauce in full resolution.</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/876/19f/154/87619f154631209be7b5b4b30882d095.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">The guy and his balls in full resolution.</a></i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/70e/ceb/58c/70eceb58cb09f5b22b6fad18a77336c5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i><a href="">Eyes @kroshka_yenot in full resolution.</a></i> <br><br>  The camera can write Full HD video at 30 frames per second.  The quality of the material at the output is very, very good, as can be judged by the test video.  Plus there is an interesting opportunity to take pictures without interrupting the video, just by pressing the appropriate on-screen button.  However, even if suddenly the video is already recorded, and someone wants to send a picture, you can take a screenshot of the video in the same way. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0yz23RFNc5k%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiA_2SVOotW2wW0roRHUBnKc0IwJg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h4>  Soft </h4><br>  The gadget runs on Android 4.0.3 OS with an unchanged Sense shell.  Now the fourth version.  In general, there are not many changes regarding version 3.5, but they are.  Redesigned camera interface, while transferring video over DLNA, you can continue to use your smartphone, the interface of the car application is updated, and most importantly, Dropbox users, using the application from a device equipped with Sense 4.0, receive 23 gigabytes of cloud space for free for a couple of years.  As for the two-year ‚Äúsubscription,‚Äù I specifically recognized on HTC: after this period expires, the files will not be deleted, and access to the data will not be frozen, only recording new information will not be possible there.  True, the question arises: how the service will understand which of these gigabytes are mine personally and which ones appeared after using the HTC smart card.  But this question I could not answer.  Wait and see‚Ä¶ <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0fe/5e6/394/0fe5e6394661e9f466b22a3bc49b357e.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Otherwise, in terms of software there is nothing unusual.  Of the pre-installed applications, I note, perhaps, only Polaris Office integrated with Dropbox, which greatly simplifies life, and notes that are automatically synchronized with the Evernote service.  Well and still free SoundHound, yes. <br><br><h4>  Battery </h4><br>  I was pleasantly surprised, but the non-removable battery HTC One S with a capacity of 1650 mAh provides about 12 hours of work in the fire mode! That is, a pair of email accounts in push mode, constantly switched on djabber, an hour and a half of music in the subway, photo glasses - photos (well, if the camera allows, then why not?), surfing the Web, an hour of calls and SMS text messages.  Either thanks, you need to say the Qualcomm chipset, or Android 4.0, or the optimizers from HTC.  Or everyone should take a pie from the shelf.  It's a pity that only Taiwanese decided to join the race of thickness ... so it would be possible to shove a more capacious battery.  I would not break off walking with a centimeter smartphone instead of 7.8 mm at all. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a1c/b4b/290/a1cb4b2900c171c566bf42c98ecd4732.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Summary </h4><br>  Long time HTC did not give anything like that!  There were powerful devices, there were ‚Äúshovels‚Äù, but for everything to be so well balanced, I don‚Äôt remember this since the time of the first Desire.  Hardware stuff, camera, software, services - all this time at a height.  Not that this height was out of reach (see, for example, the Samsung Galaxy Nexus), but the combination of chips is calibrated very precisely: the gadget turned out to be stylish, powerful and functional at the same time.  The price, of course, is not the lowest (as long as it is sold only in affiliate stores at a price of 24,990), but I think this will change pretty soon. <br><br><h4>  Specs </h4><br>  <b>OS:</b> Android 4.0 <br>  <b>Processor:</b> ARM, two Krait cores at 1.5 GHz (Qualcomm MSM8260A chipset) <br>  <b>Video:</b> Adreno 225 <br>  <b>RAM:</b> 1 GB <br>  <b>Main memory:</b> 16 GB <br>  <b>Screen:</b> 4.3 ", Super AMOLED, 540 x 960 <br>  <b>Communications:</b> 3G, Wi-Fi 802.11 b / g / n, Bluetooth 4.0, USB 2.0 <br>  <b>Connectors:</b> USB 2.0 (HDMI via adapter, purchased separately), 3.5mm audio jack <br>  <b>Cameras:</b> 8 megapixels, flash, autofocus + 0.3 megapixel for video calls <br>  <b>Navigation:</b> GPS, GPS, GLONASS <br>  <b>Battery:</b> 1650 mAh <br>  <b>Dimensions:</b> 130.9 x 65 x 7.8 mm <br>  <b>Weight:</b> 119 grams <br>  <b>Price:</b> 24990 (official at the start of sales) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/141413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/141413/</a></p>
