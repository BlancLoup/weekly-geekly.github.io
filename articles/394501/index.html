And it really hinders: both your specific business, and human civilization as a whole.  One of the ways in which it will be possible to win in oneself ‚Äúself-limiting thinking‚Äù is to abandon the outdated concept of the Target Audience. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/406/bb4/3ac/406bb43acfc0ed4a63d062af176b5fd8.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Why? </h4><br>  In ancient India, there were castes (in fact, it would be more correct to have ‚Äúvarnas‚Äù, but for quicker mastering of the context, it would be easier to use the more common notion of castes): brahmans, kshatriyas, vaisyas and the lowest ‚Äî the Untouchables (well, the insolvent population).  Now it seems wild, but earlier it was believed that the need for education is needed only to brahmans, kshatriyas - this is the audience of arms buyers there, or any land;  Well, the most sandwiched people are not capable of anything at all: neither learn, nor change profession, nor open their own business - so they don‚Äôt have to offer this.  Oh, and there were wild times, right?  Wait a minute though ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d26/dc7/341/d26dc73419a037faaa159797984e9b09.jpg" alt="image">

      So, now in the XXI century many people still think that a person is still not able to change either his level of education, or his profession, or even his gender;  although reality has long shown us the opposite.  With the advent of the Internet and the maximum availability of any information - yesterday's wipers suddenly become marketers, MacDonalds cashiers go to design, and retired old women lead hand-made groups on social networks.  This is already a reality for which the target audience of marketers was not ready. <br><br>  After all, in order to accept such a reality, we urgently have to abandon the fundamental laws of the ‚ÄúTarget Audience‚Äù, where it is clearly stated that a man cannot be interested in buying a woman‚Äôs handbag, the girl does not have the right to play Tanchiki, the railwayman will never become a start-up ... <br><br>  Understandably, I am exaggerating in order to more clearly show the artificiality of all those invented frames that prevent us all from growing and developing exponentially. <br><br><h4>  for example </h4><br>  Let's try to visually show how the old ‚Äúlinear‚Äù thinking deprives each of you up to 90% of all potential customers.  Just recently, one of the owners of the Baby Calendar service publicly addressed the experts of the RuNet with a question: how can the situation be improved on its portal? <br><br>  In my opinion, this whole situation has become an ideal litmus test, clearly showing the difference between people with old thinking and people of the new formation, to whom the future belongs: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d3e/cae/00f/d3ecae00f8beca9a414bcbdaee9922e7.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A) All the people of the linear mindset went on the beaten track and began to advise to improve the design of the site: well, rework the menu, add air, round the buttons - and with all these banal recommendations to restore the beauty on the pages continue to work with a very limited contingent of visitors, namely only with pregnant women.  Here it is clearly shown how the internal framework of the expert (mental blinders) prevent at least a little beyond the limits of the typical hacking techniques: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a59/278/06d/a5927806d7e3309922d57118ae49a0d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Roughly speaking (and judging by the birth statistics available in Yandex), all these ‚Äúmenu designers‚Äù categorically insist that the audience of such a portal would never exceed 1-2 percent of the total population of Russia. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLess is possible, more is not, because well, it‚Äôs not the peasants who go to shame on such an woman‚Äôs website, gygygy?‚Äù Actually, no. <br><br>  B) And in contrast, let us show how it would be possible to free your brain and ask yourself: ‚ÄúHow can we try to increase the portal‚Äôs audience not by 0.001% by improving usability of icons, but by two, three, five or even ten times ?  How to scoop handfuls from an infinite resource for a non-target audience? <br><br>  Think it's impossible?  Let's try to make out how to interest such a site for all those who are not in the closed caste of "pregnant woman"? <br><br>  1. There are young girls who plan to give birth not tomorrow, but definitely sometime later.  They may be interested in: <br><br>  How do they choose the right father, how to find a suitable job, how to legally issue a decree or alimony, what professions will allow to support the child independently, without relying on her husband's earnings? <br><br>  Another couple of millions of people may be interested in volunteer programs for working with boarding schools (practice on someone else in front of their institution), or there the School of Manners of the young lady, or a chat for getting to know the guys - all this will attract all those girls to the site who are now simply rejected by designers and marketers as "women in labor". <br><br>  2. There are still loving husbands and just young guys - and unless they have nothing to do on the portal?  According to the medieval laws of Central Asia, it seems to be yes, but what if you give daily nutrition advice for their pregnant wives (with advertising about discounts on yogurt in the nearest Pyaterochka), what if you give psychological, economic and legal advice again (for example, where spend the future maternity capital), recommendations for sanatoriums for pregnant women, or simply suggest to pass joint tests for psychological rapprochement.  Then their beloved wives themselves will take out the brain with the requirements to immediately download and install such a wonderful and multifaceted Baby Calendar application on your smartphone!  Here you have a few million visitors, so atypical with the old linear approach to business. <br><br>  3. Further, each child grows and develops not only in the womb, and therefore follow his diet, safety, health, and success in education - not only the first 9 months, but the next 16 years.  So there should be a calendar of children's country camps, Schedule of city sections, Audio lessons on self-defense and a chat for sharing homework, and maybe a heading Jobs for summer jobs and the Community of city quests ... <br><br>  4. And there are still tortured grandmothers who do not always know what to give a grandson every year for his birthday, and there is still a search for missing children in his city, and there is also an online learning to play the guitar and English ... <br><br>  Just a couple of minutes allotted by the author of the article for the chaotic sketching of ideas - clearly showed that millions of dollars and new users are always clearly behind the brackets of our classic concept of the target audience. <br><br>  Yes, it will be laborious, because you have to do each new ‚Äúatypical‚Äù functionality at this level of quality and love for your potential users to create a new lifestyle, form new habits and entice users from the same contact to your new service. <br><br>  (By the way, this article belongs ten times to the designers of VKontakte, because today, with such opening opportunities and technologies, for two whole years to redraw just the news feed interface is, of course, a public demonstration of the absence of even the slightest development strategy and progress). <br><br>  It is difficult, and it is much easier, without bothering yourself, to declare that well ‚Äî they are these non-target men, and in general, well, all of them, and that it is much more profitable in our time to deal with rubble and building materials than to promote unnecessary social networks and websites (and this is really ). <br><br><h4>  Personalization </h4><br>  Yes, all this personalization and BigData, beloved by many, is as inflexible and intolerant as any other statistic about the past.  History is only history, not an accurate forecast of further events. <br><br><blockquote>  Any information about what the group or one person did before - they do not say anything at all about what he wants to do right now or plans to do later.  Never.  This must be clearly marked for yourself. </blockquote><br><br>  So, a man has never been to Greece before, has never divorced and has never visited a swimming pool - and suddenly a bang, and wanted both, and the other, and the third.  I wanted hard and already ready to pay a lot of money for these desires - but even the ‚Äúsmartest system‚Äù or the classic marketer will never guess about it, since there is no such data in their statistics and database: <i>‚ÄúPeople with his wealth and lifestyle statistics don't get divorced - so sit down and don't rock the gun. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  This unfortunate person may want to change religion or food style, furniture in an apartment or country of residence, but people with linear thinking and cars will not react at all. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúSorry, but we have previously identified you in another caste, and therefore all such advertisements do not appear to you as unworthy.</i>  <i>Live only in Uryupinsk and play only tanchiki, and there is no need to evolve anywhere else so as not to spoil our diagrams. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  And how do you like it?  But this is not the worst. <br><br><h4>  The past should not determine the future. </h4><br>  Why, then, did I take up arms and, with rather harsh phrases, allow myself to criticize the existing generally accepted rules for evaluating people in their past affairs?  The fact is that I see the gigantic impending disaster, which will literally destroy our world in one generation and its name is Portfolio. <br><br>  So, these very portfolios have already been introduced into kindergartens, and Satan himself would not have invented better.  Right now, our and your children are literally from the age of 2 entering into a special portfolio all their achievements and outstanding events, as well as any problems in the child‚Äôs life, and all this is simply disgusting. <br><br>  No, if the people of Earth already possessed the flexibility of thinking and admitted the possibility of evolution and cardinal change for any person, then the idea with the Portfolio would be excellent, but in the meantime ... <br><br>  Imagine a situation when you are denied the position of the head of a department just because you were picking your nose longer in the kindergarten, and (I quote): ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt need such a dolt‚Äù (and between the lines: but 55% of children picking their nose then 35 years show low percentage of sales). <br><br>  Or you receive a letter that at the last moment they took another person to the position of a tmlid, because he had previously been accustomed to the pot a month earlier in the manger, and in fact ‚Äúthey need fast-trained workers‚Äù. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dc7/69b/6ab/dc769b6ab177d45114a0ba620cf65395.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  When you were 5 years old you didn‚Äôt pronounce the letter P very well and now you want to become a negotiator, but how can you ‚Äúlazy‚Äù with your clients?  <i>"Dismiss such immediately marked in the portfolio that people never change."</i> <br><br>  I once received a ‚ÄúFour‚Äù in English at school in the 7th grade and I can already hear how I am cheered on the phone by a girl who is exactly two times younger than me in age: <i>"- Sorry, but we need a specialist with excellent knowledge of the language, but for sure, since then nothing has improved with you, because people as a species are not able to learn anything new at all. "</i> <br><br>  Such thinking in its essence is no different from racism, which we constantly reproach the United States with, and it turns out that, imperceptibly, we are deeply stuck in it ourselves.  Yes, yes, this is the most common racism to build a business strategy on clear rules: a typical man will not do this, a standard woman does not want to, and an average child who does not exist in nature, but invented using the ‚ÄúCharacter Method‚Äù, will be happy only with such an interface .  It is frantic and undisguised racism, belittling and demeaning human abilities, our curiosity and desire for development, our faith in the new and the thirst for knowledge of everything previously unknown.  Our individual characteristics, after all. <br><br>  That is why, sooner or later, all of us will have to free our heads from the concept of Central Asia, artificially invented by us, liberate our thinking and realize that the maximum potential for growth exists only where the ‚Äúfence‚Äù into which you mentally drove your typical cardboard one and a half percent of clients . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ee/9da/113/6ee9da11340a4d4856c917763ce3841a.jpg" alt="image"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394501/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394501/</a></p>
