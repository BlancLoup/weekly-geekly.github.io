  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do not go to the dark side</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hi, Habr!  Today we will talk about a difficult moral problem: the illegal distribution and illegal use of software.  According to our calculations, the number of hacked copies of TI in the past year amounted to 3.8% of the total number of downloads of trial versions and legally acquired software.  We will not condemn those who prefer not to buy legal software, but download a hacked Trafic Inspector from numerous Internet resources.  Motives may be different: and just a desire to save, and understandable human love for freebies.  We even have the advantage that the "poor" are interested in a software product.  But in the post to justify them, we are not going to. <br><br> <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/smart_soft/blog/275847/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9c5/cf7/557/9c5cf7557a852069239778ee135ca02a.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's score in the search engine "traffic inspector crack" - and easily find more than one dozen "necessary" links.  The latest versions of Traffic Inspector cannot be found here: at best, they are releases a year ago.  In this case, the hacked program is operational in approximately half of the cases.  Yes, and here - how lucky: many on forums often complain about unstable software. <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unstable, constantly having to restart the service,‚Äù says one of the users on the Rutracker.org forum.

      This is the simplest problem in such cases.  We know more than a dozen examples when, after installing crooked versions, the network drops and you have to deal with it for a long time. <br><br>  Let's give a simple example: the cost of <a href="http://ru.smart-soft.ru/solutions/government/">Traffic Inspector FSTEC</a> (25 accounts) is slightly less than 20 thousand rubles.  Not such unthinkable money for the company, right?  If you save and put a cracked version, the network will not work normally, suppose the whole working day (until the admin has figured out what to do about it).  At this time, the company's sales department is in shock - you need Skype, uninterrupted sending-receiving mail, placing orders and so on.  Some of the clients and, as a result, the profits will be missed.  Such losses are difficult to measure in numbers, but they certainly will appear.  Extreme there will be a sysadmin.  Nobody will understand. <br><br>  The specialists of technical support for the software product Traffic Inspector have a simple opinion about the use of such versions: ‚ÄúThere is nothing good about using cracks.  The most common case is when a client gets a clean virus or something similar that forces the user to spend time setting up, which is often useless.  Such users ask us for help with setting up and, of course, do not receive this help. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúTell me, please, kind people who have set up a program - does it work normally, is there no virus in there?  I and Casper, and AVG warn about the virus.  I understand that there is a crack in the download, but ... ‚Äù, we read on Rutracker.org. <br><br>  Links promising "traffic inspector crack" often lead to fraudulent resources.  These are a variety of phishing sites that allow Internet fraudsters to obtain sensitive user data (for example, bank card information), dummy lotteries, or simply malicious programs.  It makes no sense to remind you: no anti-virus software provides an absolute guarantee of data protection, so elementary caution often becomes the key to security. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/533/944/659/5339446595b594cce6be4443c5ac4463.png"></div><br>  Follow the link ... <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/88a/25b/bf1/88a25bbf10d4dfc46c5cebc8e8338b62.png"></div><br>  Yandex we believe, but still try. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/43b/477/367/43b4773673ce9b1957469e5912a3d7a8.png"></div><br>  Sumptuously.  What we were looking for, right? <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2eb/e47/73d/2ebe4773da2f1577d3367406dd581704.png"></div><br>  One can only guess what we could get.  Most likely, no "crack".  Risking the debit of money from a mobile account (at least) something you do not want. <br><br>  Moreover, a third-party code that can perform various functions, including analyzing the actions of an enterprise in order to bankrupt it, can be implemented into a really working crack. <br><br>  Unfortunately, to delete such links quickly fails.  If torrent trackers take a reasonable position for a long time and calmly relate to the claims of the right holders, then it is possible to fight with viral links only in a court of law.  Moreover, it is necessary to prove that the owner of such a site violates Art.  <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_10699/5c337673c261a026c476d578035ce68a0ae86da0/">272</a> ‚ÄúIllegal access to computer information‚Äù and <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_10699/a4d58c1af8677d94b4fc8987c71b131f10476a76/">273 of the</a> Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ‚ÄúCreation, use and distribution of malicious computer programs‚Äù.  This process is long and does not always end in success. <br><br>  With copyright infringement is much easier.  A person who installs an illegal copy of any software automatically becomes a criminal.  Not to mention who hacked the program and generously shares it on the web.  In accordance with the user agreement, Traffic Inspector transfers the product ID, program version and license type to the copyright holder's server to obtain information about the availability of new versions.  All this data (including the IP address) is used to verify the legitimacy of using the program.  Our position is simple: sooner or later such a craftsman will necessarily be punished. <br><br>  According to <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_10699/b683408102681707f2702cff05f0a3025daab7ab/">Art.</a>  <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_10699/b683408102681707f2702cff05f0a3025daab7ab/">146 of the Criminal Code</a> "Violation of copyright and related rights", provides for at least a fine of up to 200 thousand rubles for the distribution of unlicensed software.  In more detail that "get" can not only the general director of the company, but also the system administrator - <a href="http://megamozg.ru/post/3862/">here</a> . <br><br>  As always, we would like to hear from readers. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/275847/">https://habr.com/ru/post/275847/</a></p>
