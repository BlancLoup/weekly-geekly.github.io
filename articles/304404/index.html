But now advertisers could just put radio ads on television.  What an exciting new ad channel! <br>  But as it turned out, radio advertising on television was not the best way to use this channel of communication with the audience.  Sounds familiar?  This seems very similar to the current practice of turning your TV ads into video ads at the beginning of a YouTube movie.  However, the difference here is not the media format, which is very similar (YouTube video is still video, banner ads are still text + image, sponsorship in podcasts is still voice, etc. e.) On the contrary, the difference lies in how people perceive content, in other words, context. <br><a name="habracut"></a>

      TV advertising is a relatively static event: 30 seconds of video, posted over several relevant time intervals, turned to viewers sitting in their living room (or possibly the bedroom).  Facebook feed is a bit more dynamic: you can view it anywhere (at home, in the office, on the bus, etc.), at any time, by any person, in almost any format and along with any content.  The digital age basically aggravates the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù of content, offering up to a thousand different ways of marketing interaction with the consumer. <br>  But, with big problems come great prospects.  So, what are the ways to effectively use context in the digital age? <br><br>  Assignment factor <br>  Different channels have a difference in user assignments.  At one end are channels such as Facebook and Snapchat, which fill most of the free space of our lives.  This makes them suitable for TOFU - content marketing funnels (declare yourself, products, problems you write about) - this is for those who are not looking for something specific and, therefore, more susceptible to advertising messages of any brand ( although you can, of course, use Facebook for direct marketing purposes as well). <br>  BuzzFeed, for example, did a great job of adapting its context to Snapchat: <br>  It looks as if you are viewing your friend's Snapchat in Snapchat, rather than professionally branded content.  Nevertheless, it is still the first samples on Snapchat - all companies, including BuzzFeed, are trying to figure out what content makes sense to achieve their goals. <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/DHKgyF6-Wfo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgCcOvPDhJfgLNWppFW8KmyKi2KYg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  As for Facebook, there are many good examples advertising the trademark, but one of the most famous of them is A1 Steak Sauce (a brand that produces sauces for steaks and burgers).  He became famous through Facebook, the promotion was also partially carried out using Facebook.  What is important, the video can be watched with or without sound. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2XFglTo6bg%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjsls-aEQ2JQ340IvJqhWFR2WFozA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  At the other end of the marketing funnel is something like AdWords: great when you know what you are looking for is more difficult when you don‚Äôt know.  This Oscar health insurance ad is not entirely appropriate when you use the same AdWords request: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6f4/c78/049/6f4c78049c5c5bd99a57d52202b2d1f1.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The correct purpose of the context is determined when you evaluate and perceive your ad as the user perceives it.  It is not enough to take a bunch of marketers, drive them into a conference room and make them watch your ads on YouTube.  You should feel this ad as if you are a buyer. <br><br><h5>  <b>Situational factor</b> </h5><br>  Situational context can be used with a variety of strategies, but the main theme remains the same: make users feel that the advertisements they watch are created solely for their unique request or situation. <br>  Here, for example, is an advertisement related to the sporting event that the viewer watches on TV: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/wyDSubnQd28%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhUvWXRbabOZrTLov4Ro2dIyzTz-g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Or here are some more successful examples: <br><ul><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DQODP3Hv-h3c">Burger King tailors</a> </li><li>  Burger King adjusts his preroll video (a promotional video that loads before the start of a user-requested online video and usually lasts 10-15 seconds) for the video you are going to watch. </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DLt8p0_Cp76c">HubSpot plays</a> <br>  HubSpot plays the scene as if you are going to unsubscribe from their distribution </li><li>  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DK_3uKmLFHRI">Netflix shows you a video</a> <br>  Netflix shows you a movie in the style of the well-known American TV series ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù, focusing on the video you are going to watch on YouTube </li><li>  <a href="http://adland.tv/commercials/gett-coca-cola-taste-commercial-2016-case-study-israel">Coke triggers an app notification while watching a Coke commercial</a> <br>  Coke launches a notification from an ePl app while watching a Coca-Cola commercial. </li><li>  <a href="http://www.thesempost.com/youtube-adds-links-to-buy-movie-on-movie-scene-fan-video-uploads/">YouTube automatically adds links to movie scenes</a> <br>  YouTube automatically adds links to the purchase of the entire movie when users search for its individual fragments. </li><li>  Shopify appeals to you with the simplest message immediately after you log out of your account: </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/128/eeb/42b/128eeb42ba59de3c1de4cbd02d8d2ba3.png" alt="image"><br><br><h5>  <b>Behavioral factor</b> </h5><br>  You would, of course, like to see the videos you posted on Facebook be viewed with sound, but the reality is that 85% of the videos viewed on Facebook occur without it.  You would like the viewer to watch your ad on YouTube for a full minute, but in reality 94% of users skip it in 5 seconds.  You should not force and force your users to view, you should take advantage of their behavioral features, as the following companies have done: <br><ul><li> Wells Fargo created their own version of TV ads for viewing on Facebook: </li></ul><br>  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/building-video-for-mobile-feed">https://www.facebook.com/business/news/building-video-for-mobile-feed</a> <br><br>  The most important basic idea is to make the video short, understandable without sound, and include a reference to the brand at the beginning of the video. <br><br><ul><li>  Geico created a ‚Äúnon-permissive‚Äù 5 second video on YouTube: </li></ul><br>  How to reach people who miss your ad in 5 seconds?  Make advertising just 5 seconds long! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/eAKyFw-FOJ0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhh9qxOV2ThWRH6bTS0tf-NoBUYacQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Understanding behavioral peculiarities is not the use of the channel's capabilities for the sake of the channel's capabilities, but taking advantage of the behavioral characteristics that will allow you to gain a richer experience in advertising.  This means using your own channel, searching for relevant requests, communicating with experts and making informed decisions about how people will perceive your creativity. <br><br><h5>  <b>Location factor</b> </h5><br>  The location of the user may recommend him an advertisement corresponding to his location.  (for example, Facebook advertising of increased level of awareness of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/a/local-awareness-ads">Facebook Local Awareness Ads</a> or to the Snapchat store <a href="https://twitter.com/toysrus/status/660939877710696448">in-store filter filters</a> ).  Such advertising can be unnecessarily ingenious when used unnecessarily, but if done correctly, it will be extremely useful and convincing. <br>  The AirBnB slogan sounds like: ‚Äúwelcome home.‚Äù  One way to feel like a local in a new city or country is to be familiar with a local who will help you settle in a new place and tell you about the most interesting things - this is how AirBnB service works, targeting travelers when they are looking for a specific direction on their devices: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dgYt2Fn4fn4%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhi-2_QvLDqWzclNio4BJvbsbM4EQg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Or you can simply use location services in simpler ways, such as Bernie Sanders‚Äôs political campaign targeting New York‚Äôs central population before presidential elections in the United States using Snapchat ( <a href="http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/sanders-buys-snapchat-filters-vote-york/303624/">byusing Snapchat Geofilters</a> ) <a href="http://adage.com/article/campaign-trail/sanders-buys-snapchat-filters-vote-york/303624/">geofilters</a> . <br><br><h5>  <b>Audience factor</b> </h5><br>  Targeting viewers is most likely the most powerful factor in digital marketing.  You can segment your audience into thousands of different groups - from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/164749007013531">Facebook Lookalikes</a> (similar to Facebook audiences) to <a href="https://support.google.com/adwords/answer/6379332">Google Customer Match</a> (Adwords email lists).  The better you ‚Äúpush‚Äù the commercial for the audience you are targeting, the better the result will be. <br>  You can speak directly with your competitor‚Äôs audience, targeting brand keywords: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/49e/f4d/ec5/49ef4dec5181c5c99fc4c63c40928fd7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Or even better, aim at those customers of a competitor who are going to change the company whose services they used all the time. <br><br>  Retargeting is another powerful way to use the audience factor by changing the line of your behavior to mirror the actions taken by your site (more examples of retargeting via this link <a href="http://www.growthgrind.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-retargeting-unconverted-visitors/">retargeting examples here</a> ): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2ca/285/99b/2ca28599b84651e13234b0c1a86cb644.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Of course, there are still obvious ways to influence the audience, for example, adjusting the cost of the proposal, using a slightly different tone, or finely adjusting the proposal according to the interest of the client. <br><br>  There is a stereotype that the digital age has killed creativity in creating advertising.  But in fact, the Internet did not kill creativity in advertising, but simply raised the bar higher.  Content in all its forms (video advertising, blogs, tweets, etc.) will always be important.  It may be difficult to get a viewer who will watch a 30-second ad on the Internet to the end, but properly created content can attract millions of people who are initially interested.  And more importantly, the Internet allows you to interact with your audience through thousands of innovative ways, providing an improved arena for creative marketing - context. <br><br>  Sincerely yours, <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/">Yambox</a> full-line operator <br>  (we are engaged in logistics for e-commerce) <br><br>  By the way, taking this opportunity, I want to advertise our new affiliate program. <br>  We pay <b>5,000</b> rubles for good recommendations. <br><br>  It's simple, recommend our company to your friends who have an online store, and we will pay you 5,000 rubles in the event that they become our customers. <br><br>  <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/partner/">Details here</a> <br><br><hr><br><br> <a href="http://landing.yamboks.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99f/dd1/e17/99fdd1e179c04948b9c7a06a27087b7b.jpg" alt="image"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304404/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304404/</a></p>
