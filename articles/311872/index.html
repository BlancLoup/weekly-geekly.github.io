Because this is exactly the size when processes, model and others are less important than the ability to improvise in the framework of common sense.  Like everything in a small business.  Well, many illusions disappear. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/762/f76/ca6/762f76ca609640c9accdb8179300e6c3.jpg"><br><br>  Our ‚Äúold guard‚Äù, owners of franchises in Vladivostok, Voronezh, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk - they started almost from scratch, when the word ‚ÄúMosigra‚Äù was not even heard.  These are people who have already had vast experience, and they firmly knew what to do with the premises and how, how to respond to the endless calls of advertisers and how to count money.  They stole from the stores (including the employees themselves), they quarreled with competitors and crushed them, they lost money on ineffective advertising, they themselves replaced the animators and salespeople who were ill, and often themselves knew about reporting and legal issues.  And sometimes they took the jackpot for the holidays.

      All this was just about Vladimir. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Story </h3><br>  My acquaintance with the franchisee Andrei and Zhenya began with the phrase "Our shop is near Pede" on a leaflet.  And with a little advice to reduce the degree of inadequate. <br><br>  They are husband and wife.  They wanted to open their business, but did not want to risk, therefore they considered franchises.  They found us, at first they thought that if they don‚Äôt know anything about the game, they don‚Äôt.  And then again they counted the conditions, taking into account that the goods do not deteriorate.  And it's nice to trade, things are positive.  This is not vodka at night to bang.  I must say that the brand has already worked for them.  The point opened at the end of November 2014. Place a block from the Pedagogical Institute.  It was assumed that they would buy well.  The layout is bad: 45 square meters, of which only 22 went under the trading floor. <br><br>  Almost immediately after the opening, the first people went who knew what was behind the red turret.  The stream, of course, pleased, but it was necessary to develop independently.  In retail decides place and brand.  The place should be chosen for a long time and thoughtfully, like a bride.  To grab hold of a conditionally suitable room is the first and most frequent mistake of newbies, but looking for a new month was just unbearable, it seems.  We have the first about 60 pages of our franchisee-management and about one-fifth of our ‚Äúpublic‚Äù book are devoted to this very issue.  In this case, the place was chosen well enough to get started, but not perfectly well.  On the plus side - the university‚Äôs close location, the first line, a sign visible from the road in winter, parking.  In the minuses - a terrible layout a la "former apartment-sausage" on the first floor of a residential building, not the most convenient to walk around (far from the center), in the summer because of the greenness of the sign from the road is not visible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/309/302/ee0/309302ee0d684bce8f59f01645b39261.jpg"><br><br>  <sup>Old place - filmed after moving to a new one</sup> <br><br>  At the time of the opening were Andrei, Zhenya, and still scored three sellers.  One girl of them still works.  Now in the city of 10 people, half - animators. <br><br>  The basic lesson is simple - the sign attracts people.  Barely began to highlight - people stretched.  In general, the sign, from experience, few people pay enough attention at first.  In fact, we must immediately understand that together with the rental of premises you get a rental of advertising space, which would cost from 30 to 60 thousand separately (depending on the city).  The signboard and the shop itself should attract the minimum necessary flow for payback.  All the rest of the work - advertising, events, sundress - they will go in plus later.  As a result, a small holiday was made around the shop - they even decorated trees with light ribbons, as is done in the centers of the cities around the administration.  Cheap, but noticeable from the road in the evening. <br><br>  Once a wholesale buyer called, she said - I was driving past you for the third day, the parking lot at your place was full.  I can not pick up the order.  Let's go look - it turned out, the tractor, which in the winter cleans the snow, throws it right on the parking lot at the store.  As a result, Andrei started every morning by clearing this parking lot and a couple of places down the road where those who were traveling the other way down the street stopped.  This, of course, is not an attempt to dig out a shop in Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk (there, from November to March, the door often ‚Äúsweeps up‚Äù with a slide ‚Äùand the first hour before opening is necessary to swing a shovel).  But small business - he is, yes. <br><br>  For the new year (our seasonal peak) lined up.  Zhenya happily remembers: <br>  - You beat the check, then immediately beat another check, beat, beat - and it does not stop! <br><br>  In summer, the seasonal decline began, which coincided with the crisis.  It was not very nice, and I had to think about the model.  It was then that the old shoals came out.  As a result, three weeks ago, the store moved to a new room.  The reasons?  Well, firstly, the rate on students is not very justified.  Secondly, convenient access for hiking buyers has become more important than parking.  Thirdly, I wanted to go to the center, and in the center just the seats were released, which are 15-20% cheaper per square.  But this is not because they were really cheap - but solely because on the outskirts the landlords did not re-index the rates considering the crisis.  In simple terms, the room from which they moved was still empty. <br><br>  The choice was between a shopping center or a shop on the street with a separate entrance ("straight").  As a result, we stood right next to the largest shopping center of the city, but not on the first line.  At 50 meters - the key bus stop of the city, something like the metro station Tverskaya in Moscow.  Planned two months of discovery, lived only that.  Moved overnight heroically.  They closed there - they opened at once at a new point. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c5f/65f/369/c5f65f36907c4dc09ec5dd82e39ae87f.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ce1/28d/c62/ce128dc62f5847108dcd9cbc69b3e87e.jpg"><br><br>  <sup>New place</sup> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5fe/49e/855/5fe49e8555484304b632762c169e87c0.png"><br>  <i>Moskovskaya is the main street of the center with a bunch of cafes and shops, Devicheskaya is a good transport "otnorok" from it.</i>  <i>On the other side (east) of the second most populous street, there McDuck, Sber.</i>  <i>In the interval between Nikolskaya and Moscow - a gift shop and a couple of cafes.</i> <br><br>  In the summer - not yet moved - they began to more actively use all available channels.  Judging by our questionnaires on the discount card (and almost all of them filled in) - 80% of people came to see the sign.  Andrey's trend was scary, but he did not ask for advice, but continued to develop various advertising channels.  They even tried to sell phone spammers - ‚ÄúI listened to you, but now a couple of words about our games.  The gift will look - come. "  Oh, this energy would be in a peaceful direction! <br><br><h3>  BTL </h3><br>  From the very opening there was a chain of game stores.  In general, another uncle Ford came up with the idea that in order to sell cars, it is necessary that everyone in the city should touch them.  Not on the radio, not in the newspaper, namely, to reach everyone, to tell, count and give a ride.  Personal contact has not lost a single gram of efficiency since then.  Accordingly, a rather important place in advertising activities takes in our model BTL.  Specifically - free game stores in cafes and restaurants of the city.  The point is exactly that people have fun playing.  And if then they want the games home - they knew where they came from in the city.  It was, in general, normal, but every second player turned out to be a tourist.  The fact is that Vladimir is a very tourist city, and every second person in a cafe in the center was simply not local.  Diko rejoiced at the unexpected entertainment, got acquainted with the opposite sex at the games, dragged himself - but the next morning he left. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/863/244/54d/86324454d74244268cb7c24dbb0dd9bd.jpg"><br><br>  <sup>It's very beautiful here.</sup>  <sup>This is the very center.</sup> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/151/63f/a37/15163fa37d7c4eea85dff7a663b72212.jpg"><br><br>  <sup>And in the museum in the water tower found a pre-revolutionary game, which is now reprinted as "Flirting Flowers".</sup>  <sup>By the way, with the same orthography.</sup> <br><br>  The recipe of the game store is to make the cafe collect its regular customers by itself, and the animator has already entertained them.  However, the city hasn‚Äôt really understood what is cool about institutions - they all either gathered to act purely as a platform (‚Äúyes, lead your own‚Äù) or set a minimum order, which frightened people just as good as the dress code. <br><br>  In February, Zhenya was asked at the restaurant: <br><br>  - And you spend your children's holidays? <br><br>  Marrying immediately answered: <br><br>  - We spend!  - and gave a business card.  And then I went to Andrew and clarified just in case: <br>  - We spend, right? <br><br>  Thus began the epic of home holidays.  Fortunately, Zhenya herself is a mother, and knows perfectly well what the family needs.  They did the service (looking ahead - it is typical in many regions, but the prices here were different).  Meaning - the animator arrives for his birthday, brings a bunch of games, gives a birthday gift, then everyone plays.  Joy happiness.  Only orders are few, the market is not ready yet.  Adult holidays are decided to do only if adults are without alcohol.  A couple of times burned with nagging corporate groups, where in half an hour you could shoot Resident Evil.  They don't need games, they need an animator like in Turkey - and a big glass.  As a result, every weekend there were holidays, it pleased. <br><br>  By the way, a script was needed for the holiday - and more before the training of animators, in addition to standard mechanics, crowd control (this is called the clever words ‚Äúgroup dynamics‚Äù).  Passed the course at the cool city animator, who laid the foundations of this business. <br><br><h3>  More feeds </h3><br>  All this time - immediately after the opening of the store - advertisers of the city called every day and offered something.  It is worth the company to get on the call list - and that‚Äôs it.  In this particular case - the classic "pitchfork" of the region - was got by specialists in advertising within the elevators and minibuses.  These are one of the most annoying types in any city - and they are just annoying because their advertising has near-zero exhaust for most companies.  "Liftoviki" live well basic contracts with Internet providers and pharmacies, which are two blocks from the house - but can not send somewhere else.  We have tested such announcements many times - the result is always below the recoupment limit.  ‚ÄúRouters‚Äù just exaggerate the readability of their ads several times.  Local journals also came out (on the paper market it is still considered the norm to increase circulation 3 times for reputable publications and 4-5 for smaller ones). <br><br>  The next ‚Äúpunch sell‚Äù was one coupon service.  These will get anyone.  They offered to sell hit products at a discount, drove around the ears about the miracle profits and the miracle flow to the store.  The miracle profits they add up are as follows: 50% gave a discount, from the remaining 50% of the payment - half of the office, all non-purchased coupons remain at the office.  That is, take out and put a 75% discount at least.  All this is generously flavored with jambs (from the wrong addresses of stores - the Moscow example of 2014) to the wrong products in the photo.  Well, yes, the most chic is how they in St. Petersburg tried to sign an agreement with me with an obvious typo that changes the essence of the item - ‚Äúwe will not edit the item, this is our standard contract, we have already signed it with dozens of organizations‚Äù.  So, despite all my wild prejudice against coupon services, here they worked.  The fact is that Zhenya and Andrei started selling coupons for a children's holiday - just the work of the animator and immediately a place in the partner antikafe.  No money was received on this - the output is exactly zero with regard to discounts.  But all this worked as a game store - yet many then want the game home.  So they created an advertising channel for themselves and anti-cafe, in fact.  The important point is that for some reason they did not try to bargain, although I know for sure that from a total actual discount of 75% you can reach up to 40%. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/044/5ee/bb7/0445eebb7d9d4fb5bbb58601570803a6.jpg"><br><br>  <sup>Andrey and Zhenya</sup> <br><br>  Tried the radio.  Basically, the ‚Äúweather forecast sponsor‚Äù (+ video 15 seconds).  Exhaust difficult to assess - there is no immediate impact.  But many more times we were told that we heard on the radio.  They paid not by direct money, but by barter, therefore, in general, it was normal.  We tried to cross-promo with one of the local deliveries of rolls, did not repeat.  Plus the classic is the context, moreover, Andrew leads him himself.  At least 2-3 orders per week, for a small city (and taking into account the omnichanal) - quite nothing. <br><br>  In the gymnasium, where the children of our heroes were studying, the parents somehow didn‚Äôt shine about what they were doing.  And then the class gathered a large meeting and said: ‚ÄúListen, the sweaty children run around at the big break, then they catch a cold.  Bring all the board games - let them sit and play. ‚Äù  It was such a wild insight that right on the same day Zhenya went to the television and asked me to make advertising plots about the children's games at recess.  From the video effect is smeared and at first it was not felt, but after 3-4 months a couple of people ‚Äúsurfaced‚Äù who came from a TV advertisement. <br><br>  With the meeting lucky, of course.  Usually going to parent meetings is hell.  Teachers solve for 3 hours issues that in business would require 10 minutes. They do not have an agenda and regulations.  Everything goes on a whim and unorganized.  In general, it makes one wonder how they sometimes learn. <br><br>  The next step was working with local loyalty meta-programs.  For example, there is a city card "Flycard" - for 560 rubles you buy discounts in the main stores of the city - and go ahead.  In the city, by the way, there are two points with nastolki - our Mosigra and another store for the development of children (they buy from us, by the way).  So, they gave a 7% discount, Zhenya also gave 7%.  This is not the best strategy - I would give obviously less, 3%.  And I am sure, I would have won on this both in people and in margin.  The second discount card was general student - they also fit into it. <br><br>  By the way, the "competitors" are wild.  In general, they do not understand that there is nothing to share on the market yet - it is necessary to develop the theme of board games together.  If Zhenya sends people to them from a point, when we have no games, but they have them, then there will not be a reverse process and there will not be.  On the other hand, after the move is fun: next to the new premises is a flower shop, and they tell their customers that you can buy presents in the next building.  Just because they help when they can. <br><br>  But back in the spring.  We continued to work with antikafe.  As in other cities, they only have to sell special shelves with games.  Everything else, including the exchange of pieces of paper with discounts - work in the void.  Well, almost to the void, a couple of customers were still.  The same garbage with quest rooms and flyers.  We also found out in Moscow that the exhaust was almost zero: it turned out that the creator of Imaginarium and Claustrophobia is one person, therefore the data were first-hand. <br><br>  Further simple.  Zhenya and Andrew fit into the festivals with game stores on our mechanics - everything is normal, as it should work.  There was a day of youth - a big movement on the city beach (in Vladimir, by the way, in general the main observation deck allows you to observe the beach, there was a magnified binocular there too).  There were game stores on the day of the city, all kinds of ‚ÄúDay of the Street‚Äù, ‚ÄúDay of Love and Loyalty‚Äù - they usually take place on the street in a residential area, many local residents come.  Well went to the festival "Smart Vladimir".  Collaborated with the parks.  They even played on the steps of the administration.  The effect is smeared, but it feels good. <br><br><h3>  In place </h3><br>  In my arrival it turned out the following.  First, Andrew is very careful about what they write in the questionnaires.  It is very important here - in the old sample it was ‚Äúhow did you hear about us,‚Äù then I removed it.  Just because it is generally not indicative.  The point is that yes, most people indicate the last contact, for example, they say - "But I saw the signboard."  But to see the sign and go inside the store, you must first associate this sign with something in your head.  In my opinion, a person needs from 4 to 6 contacts to just pick up and drop in.  An advertisement seen or heard somewhere will play, a passage past a cafe in the center with a huge roll-out ‚ÄúThere is a free game store of Mosigra‚Äù, something read somewhere in the net about us and so on.  And then he will go down the street, see the store - and decide what to look in.  Or see friends nastolka, and then suddenly realize that you need to buy the same.  How did you know about us?  Here, on the sign. <br><br>  In our omnichanal, the client‚Äôs path can be anything.  I played on the game store, got to google about the game, clicked on our ads in context instead of organic delivery, and here we have a buyer from the context.  Although, in fact, with igroteki, of course.  Or I went to the store, looked around, played, did not buy anything - then climbed onto the site, read more about 20 games, found a game store, went and tried, then returned to the store, bought it. <br><br>  It is difficult to estimate the omnicanal, even if the demand is decomposed.  Especially not in the city of a millionaire.  Therefore, the only option is to simply do what is right and has already shown effectiveness in other cities.  But with the mind.  For example, in Astrakhan, the store spent two months playing games on the main square, until I arrived and asked my first parent where the games came from.  He thought and informed: <br>  - Well, the city administration carries. <br>  A day later, our flags appeared on the game store everywhere.  Prior to this, it had not occurred to residents that it might be a shop.  For free.  In Vladimir, fortunately, roll-extents (such healthy banners with a frame) were immediately in standard mechanics.  True, one was stolen, and the second due to inexperience was unrolled in the fresh air (and the extender is like a kite right in its construction).  As a result, he moved the car. <br><br>  Yes.  In Vladimir, which pleases, as in many other cities, they sometimes come into the store with other people's leaflets and say: ‚ÄúBut they told me here that you have board games!‚Äù.  And the question "And where are the desktops" confidently answers even the guy who sells shawarma nearby.  Despite even a new place. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d40/448/fa4/d40448fa4eea45919cd8401104d676fe.jpg"><br><br>  <sup>Builders often come to the point with the words: see how it is done out of the attic!</sup> <br><br>  <b>Anyway.</b>  <b>The most important thing that checked in the arrival:</b> <br><br><ol><li>  On average, one person buys 2 board games in a year and a half.  This is a low figure, suggests that the work with the market is pretty tight.  Most likely, the game stores and mass channels are squandered. </li><li>  When focusing on children's holidays, the natural channel is not used - Mediyka Vkontakte targeting ‚Äúbirthday today‚Äù and ‚Äúbirthday tomorrow‚Äù.  Yes, they got burned with the usual mediyka, yes, unknowingly they put the recommended prices on VK (and not 3 times less) - but we need to try further.  Similarly, it is foolish not to use large groups for integration with posts about game stores. </li><li>  Jobs for sellers, animators (for the New Year expansion) were fed quite boring.  Typical job - a typical person.  It is necessary to turn a set of people into an event, and also to advertise it.  At least in Vkontakte groups. </li><li>  This year's trend is cashback programs with banks and providers.  Works according to the "bank leads the client, you pay for the order."  There were no such contacts in the region. </li><li>  A couple of times agreed to advertise in the media.  It is full of seams.  Once you show the money to the journalists once, they will not write anything more about you until you show it again.  The rule is to work objectively: we are a good information center for you, you are a material.  Infopovod sucks?  There is no material. </li><li>  The clients from the CRM paper forms were incorrectly entered - as a result, the newsletter with new products and interesting features (really cool) almost never came.  Now we have raised this whole base and ask their consent again just in case. </li><li>  Flyers "discount 100 rubles for the next purchase."  Actually, we had the standard material "10% discount on the next purchase of such and such games."  We thought and removed the games from it for less than 900 rubles, and gave a discount of 100 rubles.  It turned out one on one, only to people where it is more clear.  So, this flyer was distributed right next to the point: 2-4 clients per day gave a stable.  True, the man on hand was a megaprophy, and turned the life of passersby into a holiday.  Repeat this is difficult. </li><li>  In the new room there is a place for small tournaments for 15-20 people.  We must begin to carry out. </li><li>  Nearby there is a souvenir and gift shop.  There lives a unique comrade who made the game ‚ÄúVladimirskaya vyshchestvo‚Äù a la Monopoly, but with local politicians.  Ours agreed with him about selling the game at home, but it was necessary - about cross-promo in more detail. </li><li>  Analyzed the share of games in the store profits (this is a simple ABC analysis by turnover with a margin ratio).  Remade display. </li></ol><br><br>  In the process of re-laying: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/14b/8cc/d79/14b8ccd7999c4004b3498a94e9f0ddec.jpg"><br><br>  That's about it.  Now they are seeking to coordinate the signboard in a new place; advertising is just being launched at a new point.  The city is out of season for the season.  I don‚Äôt know what will happen next (in a crisis, plan for more than a month as something fawn), but, like, everything should be fine. <br><br>  PS Since the last couple of months Habr has become more about just business (without the IT part), tell me if you were interested, and I will continue to talk about the rake and success in small towns. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/311872/">https://habr.com/ru/post/311872/</a></p>
