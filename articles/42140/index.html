  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review shipping. RU</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  For a long time I didn‚Äôt go to dostavka.ru, but here I looked.  And there a year ago the site was redone.  It turned out a hybrid social network with an online store.  But it seems to me that it is in vain.  And that's why. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Correctly they say - you will chase after two hares, you will not catch a single one.  There are two hares: an online store and a social network.  Social networks, apparently, are so much a fashionable phenomenon that they are being introduced anywhere, forgetting their true purpose.  An online store, being a projection of an offline store, in no way needs a social network.  I believe that a social network is a community of people united by a common property, for example, the same interests or the same characteristics.  Offline - these are clubs and clubs where people gather and build, say, model aircraft, weave sandals or kolbasitsya until 6 in the morning.  I can hardly imagine an offline store, in which there would be a group of fans, who share with each other promotional materials for products, instructions, tell each other how to choose a laptop or epilator.  There can not be a social network of customers on the basis of a single store.  There may be a buyers club, but then it will be independent, because everyone buys where they like. <br><br>  In dostavka.ru they chased two hares, they both did not finish off.  The online store is good, big, even called the new buzzword ‚Äúmultimarket‚Äù.  Not for nothing is considered the flagship of the holding eHouse.  Social network is much worse.  We are invited to score content in the online store: add a description, instructions, guides (how to choose a product).  Motivation - a set of points, which are called cost points.  It is promised that they can buy something, but this function is in the testing stage.  Honestly, the motivation is weak.  I don‚Äôt know what the exchange rate of bones for bucks is, but I think that you need to write dozens, if not hundreds, guides and reviews to earn money on some kind of hair dryer.  The goal is initially unattainable, therefore not interesting.  All sorts of trendy features have been introduced to the heap: podcasts, video podcasts, corporate blog.  But statistics show that this is all nafik not rested.  There are only 4 podcasts, 16 video podcasts, 8 entries in the corporate blog and the last one was half a year ago.

      On a social network, I can conclude that it exists in vain.  For there is no benefit from it, and probably enough resources have been spent on its development.  It would be better if these resources were allowed to develop an online store. <br><br>  Now the actual online store and the project as a whole.  I'm not a designer, but the design confused me.  The first impression is some kind of youth site for yard culture, cartoons and some other kind of dough.  When evaluating online stores, I always draw an analogy with offline stores of the same range.  I can hardly imagine a hypermarket in which such a design would be used.  Beautiful, but inappropriate. <br>  Navigation.  Such hypermarkets always suffer from problem navigation - they have too many sections of goods, it is difficult to find a reasonable middle ground between logical and concise navigation.  Dostavka.ru has too laconic navigation - sections of the first level combine too many subsections.  I tried to find TVs.  This is where I should look for them: ‚Äúphotos and videos‚Äù or ‚Äúhousehold appliances‚Äù?  It seems that there and there it can be, but of course it is more logical in the first.  And hell there in the second.  In the same home appliances all appliances are divided into three categories: small, medium and large.  Again it baffles me - where is the border between them?  For some reason, the oven refers to the middle, and the microwave to the large.  Although the sizes of microwaves are usually smaller than ovens.  It is illogical.  It would be more reasonable to do either more sections of the first level (2-3 dozen), or divide into a smaller number of more logical groups. <br><br>  Navigation catalog.  Let's go back to the ill-fated TVs.  It so happened that I was accustomed to a reasonable sorting and filtering of goods in the catalogs of online stores.  It goes without saying that it is the selection of goods by manufacturer, main characteristics, price, sorting by price, name, rating.  Half of it is there.  But the implementation is not very good.  For example, a diagonal filter is a list of all available diagonals from 3.5 to 65 inches.  In this case, the sorting is textual, not numeric, which is wrong.  Finding the right diagonal in this huge list is quite difficult.  It would be easier to specify the search range number.  Well, the truth is, it's easier for me to dial ‚Äú42‚Äù than to wind this list.  There is no filter at all.  This is very strange, because the range is very large.  At least pre-selected price ranges, for example, pieces 5-6, would be useful.  But there is a sorting by the date of formation - what is it for?  It is unlikely that there will be a significant number of buyers who will choose a product for the speed of its shipment. <br><br>  Product page.  I really liked the detailed description of the characteristics of the goods.  But too much junk info.  For example, the guides below are shown to us: ‚ÄúHow to choose a juicer‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to choose a traditional TV set‚Äù, ‚ÄúHow to choose a heater‚Äù.  What for?  This content has a very far relationship to this product.  All other content that seems to have been generated by users is, of course, missing.  And the "Labels" functionality just kills me.  These are the same tags.  But why are there tags that mean them?  Here is a TV that I like.  What I tag him?  Whatever I have come up with to write - there is either in the title or in the characteristics.  Here would be useful bookmarks, but their role is performed by several services at once: postpone and dream.  From the titles it is clear that both services perform the same function.  The only difference is that the deferred are visible in the basket, and dream in the profile. <br><br>  I tried to buy a 42 "LCD TV.  Placed an order, chose the courier delivery method.  Showed me a store shipping cost 250 p.  Budzhetnenko.  But unreal.  Delivery of such goods to my city only at cost will be 1200 p.  Although it may be a significant part of the cost of delivery was incorporated in the cost of the goods and they can afford. <br><br>  Well, I can research, write, reason for a long time.  The conclusions here are simple.  By the execution of an average online store, in which there is excessive functionality in the form of a social network.  Unnecessary functionality spoils the online store more than improves.  Online stores are those sites where there should be expert materials written with high quality.  And not for some dubious bones.  Video podcasts should be replaced with video presentations on product pages and should be made by the store, not by users - an example on tigerdirect.com.  Otherwise, this online store is of great interest as an example of a hybrid online store with a social network. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42140/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42140/</a></p>
