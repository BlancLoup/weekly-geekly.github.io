      Below we give the three biggest misconceptions about understanding mobile audience, along with solutions that will help save time, money and nerves to brands: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Application is not an audience</b> <br><br>  Common sense says that through advertising in <b>‚ÄúClash of Clans‚Äù</b> you can reach men between the ages of 18 and 25. But targeting application users is relatively simple, and therefore not the most advanced way to find your audience. <br><br>  The <b>Words with Friends</b> app allows you to reach teen skaters in Portland ... and older ladies in Florida.  Category-specific applications are a good FIRST step towards identifying your audience, but it will be a mistake to remain at this step. <br><br>  How can brands overcome this step and avoid getting stuck on it?  Be more agnostic about applications, and delve into user data (rather than specific application data) ‚Äî this is the key to performance. <br><br>  The more data of a different type you manage to collect, the better.  Consider factors such as real-time context, user profile by location, his profile of interests and the latest data on purchases through analytics systems - all this will help to understand who you are dealing with and what your audience is doing.  This is the way you can address the right advertising message at the right time. </li><li>  <b>The place is not a man</b> <br><br>  Real-time location is not a magic tablet.  Just because you know where someone is in real time does not mean that you can assume that you know about this person all that you need.  Marketers use geo-targeting and other ways to reach moms of young children.  For example, targeting visitors to kindergarten.  But the relationship between the consumer and the location is much more complex and full of nuances. <br><br>  To form a full classroom profile, think about the patterns of movement of consumers (where it is usually before this point and where it is after), not just where the person is at the moment.  Historical location patterns provide much deeper insight.  Not all adults in kindergartens are mothers of small children.  And even if they were all of them, not all yogurts are equally useful to mothers of young children are the same. <br><br>  In the online world, we use cookies to target people based on information about sites that they previously visited.  In the world of mobile, the physical sites that we visit for a long time become an indispensable tool for brand advertisers who seek to highlight their target audience. </li><li>  <b>Location is not a tactic.</b>  <b>This is the basis</b> <br><br>  In the past, large department stores and fast-food restaurants were the main beneficiaries of location data ‚Äî they used a mobile to attract visitors.  Nearest location targeting can still work wonders for this type of traditional business, but location has evolved and become a fundamental tool for brand marketers in their image campaigns. <br><br>  Mobile is the only marketing channel that moves with the consumer, creating a truly unique set of user data for marketers.  Using this new landscape, brand marketers are now using these data to better understand users and more precisely target their message to the audience. <br><br>  The saved data about the location of the user and his movements can form a complex background of the audience segment, which is used to increase brand awareness, increase attention to him and build loyalty. <br><br>  The location helps marketers understand the demographic features in the user's neighborhood, the type of terrain where they live, work and have fun, and in general the context in which they use their mobile device.  These fundamental building blocks of information can be combined with CRM data or third-party data, and thus provide tremendous advantages for contextual targeting. <br><br>  Not surprisingly, now more and more marketers are turning to mobile advertising for image campaigns. <br></li></ol><br>  The space of mobile marketing has developed very rapidly, and will continue its development.  The good news for marketers is that the quality of data is constantly improving, technologies are becoming more compatible with each other in different media, and there is an opportunity to create and reach a completely new segment of the audience.  But all these advantages are available only to those marketing specialists who want to transform their misconceptions about mobile into completely new opportunities. <br><br> <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/register/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3Dcontent_marketing"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/041/3c5/29a/0413c529a1424210a02b160e54a40e80.png"></a> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.byyd.me/ru/%3Futm_source%3Dmegamozg">BYYD ‚Ä¢ Mobile Advertising Platform</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/291736/">https://habr.com/ru/post/291736/</a></p>
