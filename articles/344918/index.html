  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Give me your salary and I will tell you who you are</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This article was born in response to <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/344798/">this</a> one here.  Namely, here is this item: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúLebedev's rule‚Äù - no one inside the company should know how much the other gets.  Does not comply with your deputy - dismiss;  does not comply with the professional - dismiss;  You yourself have mentioned - from this moment nobody will work for you, they will receive a salary, but they will not.  Will carry out the written, but literally understood.  If a professional gets a lot, that's good.  If others know about it, they investigate, and not whether he is like a shit. </blockquote><a name="habracut"></a>  I categorically disagree with this and moreover, I believe that knowing how much colleagues get is important and useful.  I myself have managed to work in different companies, in which they treated this monetary secret differently.  Somewhere everyone knew how much he gets, somewhere it was the strictest secret, the disclosure of which threatened to be fired.  And somewhere only a limited circle of people knew about this one way or another who had access to this data.  And nowhere did this knowledge interfere with work. <br><br><h2>  Prehistory </h2><br>  We are all so used to hiding our wages that we consider it normal.  But let's see where the legs grow from?  I do not know about you, but I managed to catch the times when no one was making secrets from the salary.  Yes, usually at the same time the salary of colleagues did not differ, and the fact that someone somewhere gets more or less, did not play a special piano.  After all, it is somewhere in another department, in another enterprise, and here it is, everyone is equal.  But then capitalism burst into the country, people felt the taste of money and slowly began to realize that ‚ÄúCadres decide everything‚Äù is not just a phrase.  And now our Vasya Pupkin is going to his boss and says: ‚ÄúI have been visited by competitors from different companies, they call to me, they promise money ... more.‚Äù And the boss thinks.  What to do?  Well, no way Vasya can be let go, he is a forerunner of the production, he will leave, so three will have to be taken in his place.  Raise Vasya salary?  So after all, others also want.  What to do?  ‚ÄìYou Vasya, you know that we will raise your salary, you are a high-class specialist, we really appreciate you and do not want to lose.  Only you do not tell anyone that your salary was raised, okay?  - Why not talk?  - Well, you yourself understand, the rest, too, want, and we do not have so much money, especially since you work best of all, and you will raise, rightly so?  And Vasya happy returns to the workplace.  And honestly keeps the secret, rightly, after all, especially promised it seems like not to tell anyone.  But over time, Vasya pulled the others.  Someone was denied, someone was raised by 10%, someone by 20%, and someone by 5%.  And with all the promise, and all now have different salaries.  But Vladimir Tridsyotkin, Vasily Pupkin is no worse than working, and he is not asking for a pay rise, a wonderful employee.  Only this, it would be time already with the promises of these to tie, it is not reliable somehow.  From tomorrow, the level of income is a trade secret.  Violators to drive back, what would others misinformed, and then what good, fair wages they want. <br><br><h2>  Our days </h2><br>  So the older generation and re-educated, and the youngest from the first days of seniority inspire that the knowledge of other people's incomes is only a stone of discord.  You do not need to know this, you will sleep better.  And in the latter, they are really right, falling asleep with the idea that a colleague can receive as much or less is much more pleasant than with the firm knowledge that he gets more.  But here everything is not so simple.  On the one hand, it is really important for business that you sleep soundly.  After all, healthy sleep - the guarantee of health.  And health is the key to high performance.  On the other hand, business needs profit and more!  And profit is income minus expenses.  And our salary is with you, anyway, and expenses.  A transparent wage system does not provide room for maneuver.  While the secret wage provides ample opportunities for reducing payroll.

      How does it work?  A candidate comes for an interview, for example, it is estimated at 100 thousand rubles.  And then suddenly they ask, how much would you like to receive?  Some HRs can get a figure out of a candidate in a very professional manner.  Well, then everything is simple.  Asked say 80k, great!  We take on 80k, saving 20k per face.  Requested 120k, sorry we can offer you only 100k.  And they can make a knight's move.  2 specialists are needed, the budget is 200 thousand rubles.  One asks for 80, the other asks for 120. We take both, and what, we put in the budget.  True or not, this is another question.  But this is how the system works.  It is easier for her, it is more convenient for her, that is why she is trying so hard to maintain this situation. <br><br><h2>  And what about the transparent wage system? </h2><br>  The first thing I want to say is a transparent payment system, not a panacea.  This approach has its drawbacks and weaknesses, and we will talk about them too.  But let's first about the good. <br><br><h4>  Motivation </h4><br>  You know, over 15 years of work in different companies, I have never met a normal system of motivation.  Now I‚Äôm talking about those motivation systems, which seem to be supposed to encourage us to work better and more efficiently and from which we should receive some feedback in the form of various buns, usually money (bonuses, bonuses).  Some systems, after finishing with a file, could even make money on some kind of conveyor production, but we have a slightly different specificity.  Maybe I just had no luck, and somewhere really cool transparent motivation system works?  Share in the comments. <br><br>  But wait.  Salary is the same motivation, the main and main.  And simply in itself, the knowledge that a colleague receives more is a powerful motivational stimulus.  Unless of course this colleague is not the director's nephew and his salary is only due to family ties.  But let's not consider such situations.  In a normal situation, a colleague gets more because why?  There are a lot of options.  It works more, it works longer, it works better, it works more efficiently.  And any of these options is a growth vector.  Transparent and understandable.  And most importantly - the real.  Here he is, sitting at the next table and getting more money, take an example from him and get the same amount! <br><br><h4>  Justice </h4><br>  We have already discussed that in the system of secret salaries, everyone earns as much as agreed.  And this is not always true.  Usually, it‚Äôs not those who work better who earns more, but those who are better able to bargain more for themselves.  But everyone knows about <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/293743/">the impostor syndrome</a> ?  During the period of exacerbation of the "disease", a person can greatly lower their salary expectations.  And more than he wants, no one will pay him.  Profitable?  Yes.  Right?  I do not think.  And what does this not usually lead to justice?  Usually to dismissal. <br><br><h4>  Transparency </h4><br>  We have already said that transparency deprives the management of maneuverability in terms of salary costs.  But there is another factor that is very useful for employees and not always useful for business.  Consider a simple example.  Here you come to a new company and see that some of your colleagues have a salary 2 times yours!  And you immediately understand that what you were told at the interview about the growth prospects is absolutely true!  There really is where to grow.  And if you see that your colleagues have a salary plus or minus the same one, and some 10 years more in the company have worked, and here‚Äôs the dude, and he‚Äôs a rock old, you have to study and learn from him, and his salary is again Well, a little more than yours.  And you somehow immediately understand that the only prospect here is to get stuck in this swamp. <br><br><h4>  And what about business? </h4><br>  Well, OK, if everything is so good, why didn't the business come to this?  And why is the business still sitting in open space?  Not enough serious research showing the inconsistency of openspaces?  Why does business still measure our work in hours?  After all, it seems even to a schoolboy it is clear that a project completed successfully and on time is more important than who spent many hours in the office.  The answer is the same everywhere - business is easier.  Normal workplaces to organize more difficult and more expensive than to put tables in the openspace.  It is more difficult to manage a project than to make sure that people dig from here to lunch.  And to pay a salary openly and transparently is also more difficult than keeping it in the shadow.  Not to mention the mentioned maneuverability. <br><br>  <b>Transparency again?</b> <br><br>  Yes, again, transparency.  It is transparency that the business doesn‚Äôt like most.  Business does not want to play fair, because fair play is more difficult.  We need specialists who can answer the most important question of transparent payment: <br><br>  <b>Why?</b> <br><br>  Why does Vasya Pupkin get more?  This question is not so easy to answer.  As correctly noted in the comments to the original article, people sometimes tend to overestimate themselves and underestimate others.  Therefore, it is difficult not to answer this question, but to respond in such a way that they agree with you.  If you say that Vasya Pupkin gets more because he works better, then you need to back it up with facts.  KPIs loved by business are relevant here, as well as any statistics will be useful.  It is an open dialogue between the employee and the employer that will eventually reveal objective indicators. <br><br>  I already wrote that I worked in companies where I knew the income of my colleagues and I worked there comfortably.  Probably, the thing is that the distribution of wages there was fair?  Those.  I looked at my colleagues who get more and understood that everything is fair.  This one now gets more, because he is more experienced, and that one, because more responsibility hangs on him.  If a person considers himself the navel of the earth and wants to get a lot doing nothing, it may be worth dismissing such a person? <br><br>  <b>Recruit Professionals</b> <br><br>  There are different definitions of the word professional.  I adhere to this definition: <br><br>  <i>A professional is a person who has achieved certain success in his business, who clearly understands what he can do and what not, and does not try to take on more than he can do.</i> <br><br>  As a professional, I normally think that someone makes more of me and gets more of it for me.  Hire professionals, so that people work, and do not investigate whether someone else gets shit. <br><br><h2>  Summary </h2><br>  Not every company can work with transparent payment.  Well, simply because at the same time it is necessary not only to be able to manage personnel, but also to be able to adequately assess the work of qualified personnel.  If you don‚Äôt know why a person‚Äôs month is mythical and why the developer‚Äôs performance cannot be measured in the number of lines of code, it‚Äôs better not even try to experiment with wages.  Just make it worse.  But at the same time, it is not necessary to state that transparent payment is evil, because you have tried it and you have failed.  And even more so if you have not even tried. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/344918/">https://habr.com/ru/post/344918/</a></p>
