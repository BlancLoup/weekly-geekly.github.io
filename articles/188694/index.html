Fish is one of the founders of Kokoromi - a team whose goal is to promote video games as an art form, especially games with original gameplay.  Fish at a later stage of Fez development was featured in the film ‚ÄúIndie Game: The Movie‚Äù.  In July 2013, he announced his departure from the gaming industry. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>

      Philip is disliked by many and the reasons are obvious - he is extremely selfish.  A person who is not able to endure even the slightest criticism in his direction is doomed to lose.  This happened with Fish, a few days ago.  Here are his almost recent twitter posts. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/169/dc0/750/169dc07506334de7e6887faa18ebe8f4.png" alt="image"></div><br><br>  This hysteria and nothing to discuss, but a couple of days after that, I came across an open letter to <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2591%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8,_%25D0%259A%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D1%2584">Cliff Blesinsky</a> (Unreal and Gears of War + a couple of cool old school games), which seemed to me very emotional.  In English sources, this letter is under 5 thousand comments, but I did not find it in the vast runet, so I allowed myself a free translation.  Despite the fact that the letter is open it is partly "for those who are in the subject." <br><br><blockquote>  Dear Phil, <br><br>  A couple of times we came off, drank, and, perhaps, enthusiastically chatted with you.  I do not know you outside of our gatherings.  Your game Fez looks refreshing because of the retro style of fashion (you drew in this style before it became the mainstream, which is a little hipster, sorry!) And the fact of your involvement reminds me of yourself in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_Jackrabbit">Jazz Jackrabbit</a> era.  Get up every day (in some cases early in the morning), lean back in your chair and hatched into the monitor, create your own sacrament, pixel by pixel, line code-by-line tires.  Not to mention the colossal amount of legal crap that involves running a legal business and everything else is having difficulty in dealing with your old partner from the Indie Game: The Movie. <br><br>  I also understand that when it comes to narration, be it a newspaper column or a reality show or a documentary, the viewer or buyer sees only what the author wanted to show them, through their often twisted vision.  As I said, I know your annoyance at PAX (Penny Arcade Expo), where you showed your brainchild for the first time.  The pressure only increases when Pazhot with the team (IGTM team) pokes the camera in your face.  Any adult can begin to behave strangely under pressure. <br><br>  Just before the Beer-Twitter boom, I saw that you acquired Oculus Rift and your tweets about it were amazing.  I can only imagine that a talented, enthusiastic Phil could have created for a device in which I believe so much that I put in my own pissing money.  I want to think that my words will be confirmed if I see him in reality. <br><br>  I read <a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/so-fez-ii/1100-4700/">this</a> great article on Giant Bomb about your situation and the Internet.  I personally called all these curses.  Even back in 1999, when I made a website about scanning cats on a flatbed scanner (find it, dudes, I used cats online before it became fashionable!) I received a crazy letter.  Someone wrote to me that I should ‚Äúsuffocate in gazwagen‚Äù (considering that my last name is of Polish / Jewish origin; which is only partially true). <br><br>  The first time I got online was attacked when I was 15 on an electronic bulletin board, to all that summer my father died of a heart attack.  I learned to program and wrote a simple screensaver, one of those programs in which colored lines run across the screen.  I released it on an electronic board and someone anonymously wrote ‚ÄúYour dead Dad would have been better.‚Äù  I was angry, overwhelmed and began to threaten death.  Admins from the website called me home and got me because of the comment, but the track was already left.  I returned to the old one, squinting 2 acres of lawn to my neighbor, my shit-driven lawnmower, and again started playing Bionic Commando .;) <br><br>  I became more thick-skinned when I decided to do something with my life. <br><br>  Never underestimate the courage of an anonymous loser hiding behind a monitor and his or her ability to let go of taunts at those who voluntarily leans out.  An important detail, Phil, your twitter is read in all corners of the planet.  How many game developers can boast of this? <br>  Nobody realizes that a person can be unstable once on his avatar <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2584%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%25AD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8">Andy Kaufman</a> ?  (Kids, google Andy and suddenly Phil will seem less strange to you. Or see " <a href="http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/4538/">Man on the Moon</a> .") <br><br>  Do not forget that the Internet can be a wonderful find, but also a creepy cesspool.  Reddit is a great place to look for funny memes or random facts, until they start falsely accusing strangers of being Boston terrorists while defending losers. <br>  And you should never forget that the Internet can become a broken phone, reinforced by anonymous short-sighted monkeys knocking on the keyboard, which are so angry at their meatball sandwich. <br><br>  (What do you think, how do I feel when my wife reads tweets addressed to her, asking me to "sit on my face" or "are you a bitch?") <br><br>  Someone on Twitter asked me how I deal with haters.  I have some experience in this, at about 20 years old at the moment.  They say you can't ignore it, because by the time you read the text, it is too late.  The idiots trick is to outsmart them, because idiots use anger (coupled with weak grammar / punctuation) because the idiot doesn‚Äôt know what it is like to be witty.  See people like <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581,_%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8">Ricky Gervais</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patton_Oswalt">Patton Oswalt</a> on Twitter.  Hell, whether you like it or not, even <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259C%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%259F%25D0%25B8%25D1%2580%25D1%2581">Pierce Morgan</a> is quite good at parrying haters. <br><br>  Every idiot you outwitted increases the number of your fans by a factor of five, as well as respect. <br><br>  Another piece of advice: collect all the hatred in a big fireball of motivation inside your belly and throw it out on your work, until you can make one big fucking HADUKEN for the community, and after collecting awards and selling millions of copies, your haters will eat themselves with their kakahami you will swim in money, applause, and love the community. <br><br>  Nichrome you do not have to any gaming journalist.  We saw the dawn of many Limbaugh Rush (a famous journalist) in the gaming industry, people who made videos or podcasts, sprinkling salt on the wounds, forcing the gaming community to discuss this.  You MUST have a quality product to your fans, so I hope you‚Äôll be back in the near future.  The industry needs people like you who speak with a pure heart, not the brain, because I am already tired of listening to PR approved answers.  I'm tired of games that are supposedly made by focus groups or ignorant people who are guided by phrases like ‚ÄúHey, Kol of Duty Healthy, we need the same!‚Äù <br><br>  In addition, at the end of the day, this cycle of feedback from the community and casting that big fireball is absolutely exciting. <br><br>  Come back, Phil.  We already miss.  Maybe I'll be right behind you, returning with Adamantine skin. <br><br>  Cliff </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/188694/">https://habr.com/ru/post/188694/</a></p>
