Brevity</b> <br><br>  Two syllables.  Maximum - three. <br><br>  More - jelly. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      If there are more than two syllables, then: stress is on the first syllable, better than on the second, on the second - better than on the third, and so on <br><br>  <b>2. sonorousness</b> <br><br>  Voiced consonants are much better than the deaf. <br><br>  R - the best consonant letter to participate in the composition of the name. <br><br>  <b>3. Hardness</b> <br><br>  Better than softness. <br><br>  “Core” is much better than “Meat”, although I am one and the same supporting letter.  Just in the second case, it creates a soft, stretchy, bleating mucus: “ME-ME-A-A-S” <br><br>  And “Mayor” is better than “Mel”. <br><br>  <b>4. Sense load</b> <br><br>  Availability is a relative advantage.  It becomes absolute if it is possible to ensure uniqueness. <br>  For example, trade in spare parts.  The name “World of spare parts” (other things being equal!) Is better than “Arthur”.  In spite of the fact that the “World of spare parts” is dragged to the point of disgust (sickening “World of furniture”, etc), and “Arthur” is abstractly phonetic close to perfection. <br><br>  But if we compare the “World of spare parts” and “Arthur-Auto”, then the sense (or lack thereof) will be approximately equal. <br><br>  What would we call an auto parts store?  For example, “Steering and tires”.  Two phonetically chic words, combined together, give uniqueness.  Long  Take the "Trolley".  It is directly related to transport, a distinct note of irony (for an advantage, see below). <br><br>  Through the dissolution of DRE - ZINA, one can dig up hooligan breakdown meanings.  And easily visualized visual images of a similar direction (“Rubber is burning, Zina ends”, Cord). <br><br>  <b>5. Memorability</b> <br><br>  If you correctly handle the semantic load, an additional bonus will be a powerful memorability. <br><br>  Who will remember the "World of parts"?  And “Arthur-auto”? <br><br>  But the “Steering Wheel and Rubber” will be remembered by very many, the “Trolley” - almost everything. <br><br>  Supporting the speculative analysis of some data of popular neurophysiology, as well as skipping an excessive amount of scientific conclusions, we proceed immediately to the conclusion: <br><pre><code class="hljs erlang">  : )      , , , )   .</code> </pre> <br><br>  It is NOT banality, non-obviousness that forces the consumer’s brain to do some work on throwing the bridge association between the name of the business and its essence.  And when the work is done, its results are valuable purely biologically.  And that is why they remain in the brain - firmly seated name. <br><br>  BUT: only if the association has been established successfully.  No - all efforts past the box office. <br><br>  That is why the degree of nonprimitivity of the association “name is the essence of business” should be carefully verified in relation to the cognitive abilities of the target audience.  An ancient anecdote about “too thin a joke for our circus” perfectly describes the situation. <br><br>  The “tire” of CA from spare parts consumers will assimilate perfectly.  But “Karl Benz Motorwagen” - not everyone. <br><br>  The name “SAHARA.NET” for a coffee shop is valid in principle.  If it is positioned in the spirit of fitness / low-calorie (and similar fuflogony for washing the tender brains of a female audience), then even a wow name is quite.  But for the supermarket chain the name SAHARA.NET is a disaster. <br><br>  From life examples: the bank “Let's go” - a clear slip, from any angle. <br><br>  Or Apple.  And the phonetic name is so-so, one joy that is short and with the letter A. And the semantic load, speaking in honor, is zero.  In general, the success of the company of the same name did not help with the word “absolutely”. <br><br>  <b>6. Humanity through cultural affinity, intimacy, community</b> <br><br>  Almost always a plus.  Rare exceptions relate mainly to serving the needs of officials, and this is generally a weak relation to the competitive business.  So we neglect. <br><br>  Humanity is created by the stratification of meanings.  Ideally, in a bouquet of meanings you need to have irony. <br><br>  The multiplicity of meanings, on the one hand, makes the brain work, and, as we said above, automatically adds value to the results of this work (hence the memorability of the name).  On the other hand, the consumer who catches subtexts feels his closeness, kinship, community with the brand.  “Cultural code”, referring to the nationalist language creativity. <br><br>  Compare “Bread and Wine” and “Shop Eliseevsky” <br><br>  The presence of an ironic layer in the semantic load insures against excessive pathos. <br><br>  An example is with the “Dresina”.  Something old, creaking, grandfathering.  Deep Russian - endless expanses, the men in the Civil from morning till night with roll-ups in their teeth and caps on their heads move the lever.  Ideal for trading s / h under the domestic avtovedra. <br><br>  Or from our practice of naming: “Hands from the shoulders”.  It is clear that the reference to the well-known and controversially censor-like (such a wink) “hands from assholes”.  Understanding - 95%.  The memorability is excellent.  Long  Yes, here's a cut (ruki-iz-plech.ru): RIP.  Funny  Otozh.  And still remembered <br><br>  <b>7. Abbreviations</b> <br><br>  Almost always a minus. <br><br>  “TCS Bank” - well, rubbish is trash.  Despite the fact that unfortunate names had an amazing (with the same Cord) handicap - the presence of the already super-twisted “Tinkoff”.  Compare: “Tinkoff Bank”.  Or simply “Tinkoff”. <br>  Exceptions are obvious references to abbreviations that have historically become strong brands.  Type “IBM PC”.  Or when the abbreviation is selected for phonetic oblazvuchivaniya. <br><br>  However, if the main part of the intended name needs such crutches, then it is reasonable to think about another name. <br><br>  In terms of content, in fact, everything. <br><br>  As a practical work, we dissect the most famous among the audience of the Russian Federation the fruit of our naming surveys: Yulmart. <br><br>  Rule 1 - yes.  Emphasis on the first syllable, although in a two-syllable name it is not fundamental. <br><br>  Rule 2 - yes.  All consonants are voiced, except for the last T. However, in the Russian language, the dead-up voiced consonant is now pronounced as deaf, so even in a purely phonetic sense, for example, YulmarD would not add any advantages. <br><br>  Rule 3 - yes.  All consonants are solid. <br><br>  Rule 4 - in part.  “..- March” by the target audience of the project is clearly recognized as something commercial.  “Yul-” does not carry an independent meaning, but: the name was born in Ultra Electronics, for which it was a side project.  Accordingly, “Yul-” was originally “Ul ..:” (Ulmart), and the lack of meaning would have to be compensated for by the guaranteed flow of loyal customers from the related business.  So it happened in the end. <br><br>  Rule 5 - no.  Minus, however, the previous advantages were considered sufficient, and successful practice confirmed this. <br><br>  Any rational decision is a compromise, the quality of a compromise is determined by maximizing the pros / minimization of the minuses in the given environmental conditions. <br><br>  However, even if you have chosen a shitty name for your business, this is not a sentence.  You just missed the opportunity to give your venture more chances for success. <br><br>  Easy, free and instant - similar to the <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/ultima/blog/299590/">right system of material motivation</a> . <br><br>  PS For those interested in the topic, we propose to independently analyze according to the proposed criteria, for example, “Eldorado”. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/301582/">https://habr.com/ru/post/301582/</a></p>
