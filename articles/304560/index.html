Summer has firmly entered its rights, it is the height of the holidays.  We decided to find out how IT specialists spend their time on vacation, and conducted a survey among users of Habr and My Circle. <br><br>  A total of 3342 respondents answered questions. <br><br>  It turned out that many people continue to program and improve their skills even during their holidays.  For the most part, computer-aided professionals love to travel around Russia, mostly with a family or a couple.  Many are willing to spend the last money on vacation and go on a journey at any time, not bothering to prepare and accumulate the necessary funds.

      For details and answers to other burning questions - welcome under cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/082/b40/e96/082b40e969a14a168611a8bbd81cc4ea.png"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  What is your specialty and experience? </h2><br>  The distribution of respondents by specialization roughly corresponds <a href="https://moikrug.ru/info/employer">to the similar distribution of</a> applicants on ‚ÄúMy Circle‚Äù: most of all we have programmers and layout designers.  Most, however, are not new to their field and work for more than 3 years. <br><br>  I wonder if there are any differences in the rest of specialists from different directions?  Let's try to find out in the course of our humble research. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2ac/d60/685/2acd60685a81477980dfc31bd2aca8f6.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ef0/e00/0a8/ef0e000a887a485396de5807db6b91f2.png" width="500"><br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  How many hours a week do you work? </h2><br>  The majority (67%) work strictly in accordance with the labor code.  However, a quarter prefers to work overtime as well (18%), and even overtime (6%).  Surely busy with their startups? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/79a/594/d2e/79a594d2e69647e4b5cc1cfafe28568b.png" width="500"><br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  How many times a year do you need to rest, and how long does it take to rest after six months of active work? </h2><br>  Half of IT professionals are unanimous and quite conservative in matters of alternation of work and rest: they prefer to rest twice a year, for 2 weeks.  However, it is curious that there is a significant group (more than 40%) who prefer to rest more often. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/73e/bca/fef/73ebcafef3d948d28746fe5ca3ca0162.png" width="500"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c4/b57/012/9c4b5701276e4d68b4a8320121f53897.png" width="500"><br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Are you relaxing alone or as a family / couple? </h2><br><br>  Most IT professionals rest with a couple or with a family. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15d/01e/64a/15d01e64a3294baf83f6eb36cd72142c.png" width="500"><br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  What type of activity do you prefer on vacation? </h2><br>  As it turned out, the favorite type of activity depends little on the specialization of the IT specialist.  Half is considered the best vacation travel.  And for a third it will be communication with nature.  But there are small nuances. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/420/ce2/2b2/420ce22b2a9443dd8e0352f9be144500.png" width="500"><br><br>  Inclined to travel during the holidays a little more among managers, designers and mobile application developers (60% of specialists of these profiles prefer this type of recreation). <br><br>  Programmers and administrators like to rest in nature a little more than others (33-34% of them prefer this type of vacation).  And least of all, nature lovers among designers and developers of mobile applications (23-24% prefer). <br><br>  Testers are a bit more inclined to the extreme type of rest (17%), and marketers, managers and designers are less inclined (7-8%). <br><br>  More than others, marketers, designers and administrators are likely to attend events during vacations (7‚Äì9%), and managers are less inclined (3%). <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3c0/82e/b74/3c082eb7419f456ab69bb54231a8dc07.png"><br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Do you use vacations to program for your own pleasure or to engage in professional development? </h2><br><br>  It turns out that almost half of the developers do not stop programming even during the holidays!  And professional development continues to engage in even more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/87f/b01/628/87fb01628d66440f89dac0b7c669caa5.png" width="600"><br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  Do you save money to take a vacation or can you afford to do it spontaneously?  Will you go on vacation if you have to spend 80% of all your current savings on it? </h2><br><br>  About half of IT professionals can afford a spontaneous vacation, they do not save money for this.  Also, almost half are ready to spend most of their savings on vacation, traveling for them is more valuable than money (= <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/59c/731/b93/59c731b9328d43648bff32d4d9d595e5.png" width="600"><br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  How much money are you willing to spend on vacation for 1 person? </h2><br><br>  About half of IT professionals are willing to spend on vacation from 40 to 60 thousand rubles per person.  It is curious that the share of specialists with higher incomes does not decrease gradually, but it‚Äôs clear that there are two groups of incomes: the first is dominated by those who are willing to spend 40 thousand rubles, and the second are those who are 100 thousand. We can also say that with the lowest incomes do not make up the largest group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/886/212/293/886212293c854ff3a5d8f36734ab62c6.png" width="500"><br><br><hr><br><br><h2>  What is your favorite vacation country / destination? </h2><br><br>  Almost half of IT professionals for recreation will choose Russia and its near-abroad countries.  Another third prefer to rest in Europe. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6c3/0a6/846/6c30a6846a1a4f72a1f69c2bf5c43d6b.png"><br><br>  It is interesting, and whether preferences differ in a specialty? <br><br>  It turns out that in Russia, programmers and administrators prefer to rest a little more than others (among them 40-45% indicated Russia as a place of rest). <br><br>  Europe is a little more than others like designers, managers and testers (40-45% of preferences). <br><br>  Asia is more preferred by marketers (23% of preferences). <br><br>  But neighboring countries are much less than others for some reason like managers (only 2% of preferences). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a66/ed3/18c/a66ed318c7ad44e19850d3289be8aa76.png" width="500"><br><br>  But the top 10 most popular countries and regions for the holidays.  Our people obviously prefer warm countries!  Moreover, Spain and Thailand lead with a clear margin. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a6/b7e/686/1a6b7e686afe4e39b35244759596eaae.png" width="500"><br><br>  We thank you for your attention!
