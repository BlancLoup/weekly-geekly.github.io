Yes, yes, it is with you.  Do not look away, and do not flip through the page to the next post.  Come under the cat - there you will find part of yourself. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I'm 26 years old now.  This is not much and not enough.  It is somewhere in between.  That age, when you became independent and responsible for a long time, but you have not yet fully managed to try on the role of a husband, father (grandfather ?!).  However, as an adult, I did not feel myself, nor did I feel.  To be honest, I did not even understand yet what it means to be an ‚Äúadult.‚Äù  Sometimes, for example, after some <a href="http://www.webpark.ru/comment/44218">posts</a> , I clearly remember my childhood.  Such memories can roll in waves when you meet a classmate (and even more so, a classmate), when you meet some objects from childhood (recently bought <a href="http://www.groupon.ru/moscow/newgame">Dandy</a> ; yes, that Dandy!).  And sometimes it can be just a sound, a smell, a ray of sunshine in the morning. <br><br><h4>  Retrospective </h4><br>  What do you remember at such moments?  Yes, I ask you again, homo sapiens on the other side of the screen.  Of course, it depends on the case: you remember one thing with your classmates, and playing with Denty is quite another.  But everyone has some pleasant, most memorable episodes.  I have several such episodes.

      Thinking about <b>friends</b> , I remember how we played Cossacks-robbers: how delightful it was to rush for the girl, in the questionnaire of which (remember, there were <a href="http://www.76-82.ru/other_folk/346.html">such</a> ) the day before you wrote that you considered her the first class beauty.  And then headlong away from her.  The truth is not very fast, so that she does not lose interest in running after you.  Then I remember the birthday of a friend whom I was not called to, and there they played ‚Äúbottle‚Äù and watched some new cartoons on cassettes.  It was terribly disappointing, yes!  Fights wall to wall, climbing trees, "fun starts", spitting balls of paper through the tubes from under the handles and much, much more. <br><br>  I often remember <b>grandparents</b> .  How nice it was to walk in the early summer morning in the local park with a grandfather: fir smell, warm sun and a light cool breeze causing goose bumps.  Absolutely fantastic memories of how my grandmother put me to bed in the evenings, luring me with a mug of warm milk and a huge cake.  And those moments when in the winter you run for lunch from the yard through wet and with a huge snowdrift on a hat, snow stashes in boots and inside mittens!  And a solid snowball in your pocket is your last ammo.  You are patiently undressed, forced to wash your hands and eat this huge bowl of soup.  And the thoughts you have back there in the yard. <br><br>  Of course, <b>parents</b> .  Family kayaking trips.  Trips to some distant cities where parents were climbing (yeah, try saying that word in 5-6 years).  Hiking to visit!  Distinct memories of how mom is going, painted;  Dad is reading something or looking for his pants or belt (the belt knew how to hide well, maybe that's why they never fought me), and in the apartment at that moment ABBA, or Vysotsky plays.  Well, or Rosenbaum, at worst.  Loved sharing movies.  There were no films then.  Even on torrents, which then worked in the form of stalls in the city center, new items appeared very rarely.  And then my parents loved Sprite very much.  After the climbing wall or jogging, we bought two two-liter Sprite bottles.  What he was then delicious!  Later, it revealed E236, E301 and other useless, or frankly harmful ingredients. <br><br>  All these memories are one in one: I always and everywhere subconsciously felt safe.  This feeling was an indisputable truth.  It was completely natural to me.  Now I already understand that this was due to the fact that I had a large family: parents, grandmothers, uncles and aunts.  Of course, I was scolded and punished (absolutely in vain in places! What? No, no, this deuce in mathematics is not at all mine, a completely worthy deuce in my diary; go to the corner, say? Okay, okay, just don't swear, ma! ).  But for all that, I knew that I was loved, that I would be helped and protected. <br><br><h4>  Gavroshi </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/8543d747/3a2617b1/cac1178f/1e5c211d.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, I knew that there are different situations in life.  That there are children who have an incomplete family, or no family at all.  Attitudes towards them changed and grew with me.  As a child I didn‚Äôt like them and I was afraid - it was with such teenagers that fights occurred most often.  I was afraid of them for a crazy, some kind of adult cruelty and turretlessness.  Then he was somehow indifferent.  Now I have immense respect for those who grew up in an orphanage and have not drunk, have not lost their lifeline.  I respect the same for what I was afraid in childhood: for spiritual strength, understanding of life, for harshness and honesty. <br><br>  However, now, at 26, I already see this picture completely.  I see the beginning of their lives as abandoned babies in urban children's hospitals.  Abandons  Fucking nasty word.  It means that some kind of cottage (usually much younger than 20 years old) wrote ‚Äúan official rejection of motherhood‚Äù.  Well, that is, she received her average <a href="http://www.sunhome.ru/journal/12486">19 minutes of</a> pleasure, and the child went to the frost!  Everything. <br><br>  Written by me at first will not apply to this child.  He won't have grandparents or parents.  There will be few friends and they will have nothing to play with.  Or they will have no time for that - they will have to survive: to beg, steal food, steal money.  You understand what the situation in our children's homes now?  But that, if they live to this age.  Now they are babies in children's hospitals.  And you understand what the situation in our children's hospitals now? <br><br>  And what to do?  Who will help?  <a href="http://lurkmore.ru/%25D0%2592%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2585%25D1%2583%25D0%25B9">The people, the party, the government, Putin</a> ? <br><br>  We.  Me and you.  That's who will be.  And no one else. <br><br><h4>  And where is the Hub ... </h4><br>  I am sure that such a question will not even arise.  As long as there are more people on Habr√© than a UFO.  Although, I think, aliens are not alien to anything human.  However, I will remind one fact. <br><br>  <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2594%25D0%25B6%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D1%2581,_%25D0%25A1%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2">Steve Jobs</a>  Everyone knows his story - he was adopted by the Jobs family.  If it were in our country, he could easily not have survived the period when he was under the care of the state.  Now imagine that this happened, and delete half of the posts on Habr√©.  And yes, get your iPhone out of your pocket and throw it out.  And in general, forget about all i-technology, forget about the ‚Äúcomputer revolution‚Äù.  Do not look at Wall-e and in general all works of Pixar. <br><br>  I believe that among those children who are in children's boarding hospitals, there are many talented minds.  Even if not as brilliant as Steve, then more talented than me, you.  In just 14-16 years here, right here in Habr√©, they will ask stupid and clever questions, write interesting posts and leave funny comments. <br><br>  Only a decade and a half, and they will explain to us, hardheaded programmers and designers, why Windows 21 is an open operating system developed by Microsoft together with Apple.  They will be surprised that in iOS4 there was no support for Flash, because in their iPhoneX the operating system is based on Flash.  And they will teach us how to write scripts on objective-functionative-smiple-C under the Google search engine from under Android.  And we will learn from them. <br><br>  We will learn from them later.  But you need to help them now. <br><br><h4>  How to help these girls and boys? </h4><br>  It's all obvious, not for me to teach you.  You yourself understand everything perfectly.  Need help and things, and things, and money.  There are a lot of <a href="http://bvf.ru/forum/forumdisplay.php%3Ff%3D392">forums</a> and blogs of people who already do something on your Internet. <br><br>  I'm from Voronezh.  And the situation in the Voronezh children's hospitals is nowhere worse.  Therefore, I ask you to help.  Consider it a startup.  You invest money now and you get satisfaction later. <br><br>  Contacts can be found on the relevant <a href="http://bvf.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D726964">links</a> .  There are also <a href="http://bvf.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D367311%26page%3D11">photos</a> .  And <a href="http://bvf.ru/forum/showthread.php%3Ft%3D453588">stories</a> .  And many other things.  Let's grow our future together.  You and me. <br><br>  You can talk a lot, but you already understand everything. <br><br><h4>  Epilogue </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/1d382b66/e8701c50/560910c7/c8f1973b.jpg"><br><br>  I have a living, impressive example in front of my eyes.  Girl.  My age mate.  With a little son in her arms, without a husband.  She doesn‚Äôt have iron nerves or an impenetrable psyche, she is busy at the very least with her child care and making money, she helps children's hospitals.  Helps kids.  Collects money, buys things, delivers, trying to organize other people to help our decaying state medicine.  Her utterly upsets the sight of abandoned children and human indifference.  But she does not retreat.  I have something to learn from her. <br><br>  <b>PS</b> I will explain a little.  I myself hate tearful posts.  And did not aim at that.  A post about something else - about the fact that there are children, many abandoned children.  This is not interesting, it cannot be programmed at night and it will not work out to show off to the girls.  This is, and while it is, all gigovskaya blessed and heaped gadgets are not worth a donut hole. <br>  <b>PPS</b> "And where is the Hub ...".  I was wrong - such a question arose and it is almost the main one.  Friends, I have bad news for you. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129011/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129011/</a></p>
