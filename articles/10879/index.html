Perhaps this was the last straw in order to take radical actions to get rid of the eternal confusion in the numerous power supply and chargers for wireless (and not very wireless) gadgets lying under the table wires.  When there are no free sockets in the network filter, it becomes useless to try to simply unravel this web.  Unravel two wires - three will get confused.  A more effective solution was required.  Below is a recipe for one of them and a few photos to illustrate it. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Somewhere on the Internet I have already seen photos of organizers for chargers.  They were special boxes, the inner space of which was divided by partitions.  After the assembly, only the short tails of each adapter remained hanging out of such an organizer, which deprived them of the possibility of getting tangled among themselves.  Considering that in our latitudes nothing of the kind is being sold, and the order of such a thing from an overseas store is not just a matter, but a whole project, I decided to sculpt something like this on my own. <br><br>  As the basis for the construction, a regular drawer of the drawer was used.  I think the advantages of this choice should be clear without explanation: in the box all devices will be at hand, the risk of losing one of them is reduced, plus the fact that the age-old layer of dust disappears (yes, once in every eternity).

      <br>
      For a start, I cut a <strike>hole</strike> in the back of the drawer for the output of wires. <br><br><img src="http://img.paradigm.ru/20070616.IMG_6296.jpg" width="500" height="362"><br><br>  After that, I pasted a plastic cap there to give a more appropriate look.  Such plugs are sold in furniture stores and are usually used to bring to the surface of computer tables the wires from the monitor, mouse, and other peripherals. <br><br><img src="http://img.paradigm.ru/20070616.IMG_6300.jpg" width="500" height="333"><br><br>  ‚ÄúLiquid nails‚Äù (fast drying silicone glue) are very suitable as glue.  Excess glue after drying is easily cut off with a stencil knife. <br><br><img src="http://img.paradigm.ru/20070616.IMG_6302.jpg" width="500" height="333"><br><br>  Through the hole, I brought the wire from the installed inside the power filter with separate switches on each outlet, and the power cable of the USB box for the external hard drive that was on my desk.  By the way, one day after the photo shoot, I put this hard drive in the inside of the box, so only one wire left from the back wall. <br><br><img src="http://img.paradigm.ru/20070616.IMG_6304.jpg" width="500" height="333"><br><br>  In order for the tails of the power supply units not to be tangled, I wound them up and fastened them with tape ties. <br><br>  This type of network filter is not accidental.  Now almost all adapters lack switches.  Considering that many devices are not used continuously, it is unreasonable to keep them continuously connected for reasons of energy saving and fire safety. <br><br>  Speaking of fire safety.  When assembling, I was worried about the lack of ventilation and possible overheating.  There was even a thought to mount a pair of 120 mm fans into the back wall of the cabinet.  In fact, it turned out that nothing like this happens.  Even with the box closed, the temperature remains acceptable.  But in any case it is better to turn off all devices with the main switch in the absence of the need for them. <br><br>  Lastly, I want to clarify that such a solution is certainly not possible with any furniture.  There is a gap (about 3 cm) between the inner side of the back wall and the drawers inside the drawer of the photos.  Due to this, the wires brought outside do not prevent the boxes from closing and are not clamped. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/10879/">https://habr.com/ru/post/10879/</a></p>
