This time we received three times more applications and selected three times more projects.  And I am convinced that such a number of talented people, concentrated in one place, working 24/7 and obsessed with their projects, will surely strengthen each other and together we will achieve great success, ‚Äùsays Anna Degtereva, CEO and Borda member of Happy Farm. <br><br>  The set of projects started in January 2013 and officially ended on May 10.
