  <section class="page js-page"><h1>when you become an insider (lyrical reflections)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  when I worked in the FIU I had a blog.  I sometimes wrote about work there, but I did not reveal any special secrets, I wrote only about my colleagues.  if I were in leadership, then maybe I would have written about the decisions of the FIU, and about the reform, and about the attitude towards it, and about how-can-steal the base ... <br><a name="habracut"></a>  to steal the base, in general, the work was not.  but the fact is that there are different bases in the FIU;  the one I worked with for almost two years, I don‚Äôt really need anyone - who cares about 20,000 pensioners?  Moreover, without this program, this database is normal and you don‚Äôt look, sort through and compare records in more than 40 files - it's boring. <br>  I wrote a blog, wrote about my colleagues and about their stupidity even when I began to lead them.  I did not want to lead, I was not eager to be in charge, but I was promoted and I had to carry this cross.  becoming a leader, I got some knowledge that allowed me ... let's not talk about what was not.  In general, it is possible to deceive the program and get a substantial salary increase, and no one will notice if you do everything right.  Of course I check there, but when the amounts reach 96 million rubles, your 10-15 thousand will easily dissolve in the total mass.  but remember this is a felony!  I warned you. <br>  then I went to school and started another blog.  The whole problem was what to write about - children and teachers?  About children can be, but quickly get bored.  about teachers is possible, but I never met them - I talked with a maximum of ten.  write about what is happening in the administration and what intrigues are trudging, where does the money go and about everything else?  Well, one, two times you can ... and then?  in general, the blog has closed, left school. <br>  I now have another job, and I still run a blog (thematic and all that).  the work contributes to the generation of content (in many ways very exclusive!), which fits in all respects with the theme of the site, fits perfectly.  Every day I learn something new and interesting - there is something to write about, there‚Äôs enough for a book.  but the question is - is it worth it?  Is it worth it to wash dirty linen in public, or whatever? .. <br>  I lead to what - to the fact that it would be nice for some organizations and companies in our country to be closer to the people, to keep blogs - the law came out, they discussed it in a blog, they poured mud, constructively scolded, looking, and revised.  or anything ... feedback, as they say. , than the aunt-accountant with 20 years of experience ... not about that now.) <br>  in fact, I wanted to write a note about something else (but what happened, it happened) - whether employees in their (personal) blogs can talk about their company, organization, etc., then eat and carry dirty laundry and show it everybody?  that's what I wanted to write about. </div>
