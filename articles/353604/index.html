      We ourselves have chosen the difficult path of <a href="https://www.mann-ivanov-ferber.ru/teal-organization/">turquoise organizations</a> , now we are <s>suffering</s> and we will tell you about it. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Features of work in Pokupo <br></h4><br>  1. There are no positions in the company, but there are roles that are not assigned to a specific colleague and can be transferred to anyone.  Of course, there are specific roles - static - like legal or accounting, but in general the company has a simple principle - everyone chooses / creates the role that is of interest to him and is useful for consolidation. <br><br>  So, for example, we had the role of a librarian, because the person himself wanted to do this work.  Wander from colleague to colleague the role of the Keeper of the tracker.  The most problematic role - Sold.  But here the problem is not even the role, but in general, the concept of a turquoise organization within a commercial organization.  We decide.  There are achievements here. <br><br>  2. We also have no managers, chiefs and a boss from the word ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù (said the boss :)), but there are leaders in their professional circle.  The position of the boss is called the role of captain, historically, of course, this is my role, but more than once I gave the helm to my colleagues, and I am sure that our ship will not sink, even if suddenly I wash off from the bridge. <br><br>  3. The income, expense and profit of the association, we all see colleagues in real time.  I think this is important, because everyone knows what income will be paid to him for the month. <br><br>  4. The concept of wages is absent, instead, personal income, which depends on the overall profitability of the project, the decision of the team, the request of the colleague, as well as the amount of work performed. <br><br>  5. A year ago, we completely abandoned the office, everyone works remotely according to an agreed schedule.  The schedule is very flexible.  Since we made a choice in favor of working with the head, and not 12 hours a day. <br><br>  It is important to build relationships on complete trust, eliminating unnecessary control.  We have the aforementioned tool for recording work time and tasks - it is quite enough for control, first of all, for self-control.  It is not profitable for anyone to cheat.  For what?  We have no punishment system.  Even in the case of misconduct, the failure of the term - a constructive dialogue - the main condition for achieving mutual understanding.  A person who is serving a room solely for the sake of money is immediately visible - words with deeds are diverging (this is a general idea, in our company there have not yet been such - a tree - tuk-tuk-tuk - should help).  A person aimed not only at the income, but also at the result, acts differently.  If by some miracle a frank lobber shakes up, then sooner or later he will show up and voluntarily drop out. <br><br>  6. For the success of the common cause, each staff colleague is personally responsible.  And if someone <s>kicks a ballad prokrasiniruet</s> , any colleague to bring the motivation in the norm can and should report this at a meeting. <br><br>  This month, for example, had two such problems.  Excessive designer on third-party projects made him more relaxed to relate to their regular income.  After the transition to the hourly fee, he returned to the clip. <br><br>  Also, the copywriter unexpectedly completely lost the charge in writing texts - they talked, he said that the texts in the blockchain and ecommerce sphere are not his, everything he could, he issued, and is now revising his roles.  Taking into account legal education, it can concentrate on this in a company, can reduce its working day and, accordingly, income or offer some other useful role.  Everything depends on him and his degree of interest in the project and immersion in the project. <br><br><h4>  Stages of joining a team <br></h4><br>  How do colleagues become so? <br><br><ol><li>  For starters, one of our colleagues proposes to expand the staff to delegate old roles or new ones that have arisen in the current circumstances and taking into account the development potential. </li><li>  Everyone who is looking for is surrounded by candidates for interns, now, of course, this is our rare case, as anyone could, we have already tried everyone;) </li><li>  The seeker of new colleagues (there is such a role, at the moment mine) places a vacancy announcement on work sites and in social networks. </li><li>  Job responses are analyzed for data completeness, social network activity, and other factors.  The goal is to remove irrelevant responses.  50-60% of those who wish are eliminated on this filter. </li><li>  Those who remain will be sent a large questionnaire.  At first glance, not all the questions seem adequate in it (attitude to politics and the President, religion and favorite colors), but for the second stage of filtering, they are all important.  One of five candidates passes the questionnaire. </li><li>  After passing the seeker makes an online appointment with the candidate.  The main point is to meet in person and understand what a person lives, what plans to live with him.  Here comes the dropout again.  One of the three refuses himself, the second refusal receives from us. </li><li>  There remains a candidate who is invited to the team and receives as a result the role of an intern.  This means access to the main channels of corporate slack chat, task tracker and basic organizational documents. </li><li>  The intern gets acquainted with the team, three versions of the Most Important Document (SVD) and slake. </li><li>  Then he receives a test task either from colleagues, or sets a task and deadlines for himself (which is best).  The main thing is that the task was measurable, real and without props.  It is carried out on a voluntary basis, according to the decision of colleagues, remuneration can sometimes be paid, but usually it is an attempt at writing and gaining new experience.  The stage of dating takes 1-2 weeks. </li><li>  The results of the tasks performed by colleagues demonstrate at a weekly rally.  Need to answer basic questions: What is the result?  What has been done / not done to achieve it?  Plans and suggestions?  Following the results of a couple of weeks, the trainee either becomes a non-full-time colleague, or mutual thanks and separation. </li><li>  First, the work of a freelance colleague is paid for completed tasks.  The term of this format is 1-2 months, the goal is to adapt and demonstrate the effectiveness of the roles performed.  Often, such a stage is agreed upon. </li><li>  The next level is the freelance level.  Those.  A freelance colleague works in a clockwise rate, which is agreed with the team.  Here the goal is to learn how to work independently in a team and bring the number of effective working hours to the norm.  Some colleagues work this way because their roles are not fully loaded (the same example with the designer). </li><li>  If a colleague is effective outside the state, he has the right to move to the main state with a guaranteed monthly income, as he tells the team.  The team approves a colleague, he gets full access (admin rights) to the tracker and communication channels. </li><li>  After successful interaction for 1 year, each full-time employee can become a co-owner of the company, namely, to earn a share of participation in the association through a system of labor contributions.  The share gives the right to receive part of the company's profits, as well as the opportunity to participate in making major decisions in the association. </li><li>  And then incrementally.  With work experience of more than 5 years, a colleague has the right to sell the share to other colleagues. </li><li>  The 10-year experience provides for the status of an honorary colleague, which allows both to sell a share and to receive passive income at the expense of it, even if he leaves the association. </li></ol><br>  This system only recently received the right to life.  But point 14 is already <a href="https://ethplorer.io/address/0x99956039cf17c750edc761d5575481078280e4ad">being implemented in practice</a> , the shares are issued on the basis of the Ethereum progressive blockchain platform.  And the logic of the company's functioning in the conditions of paragraphs 15 and 16 is implemented in the form of smart contracts, so that there is no possibility of subjective influence, and also that the whole process is transparent and independent. <br><br>  That's all.  We are glad to see people creative, open, and inclined to development, if this is you - welcome to our <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/Cyu5JQ2skoauGtavH-B-eg">Telegram chat</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ml/ns/wc/mlnswcpg3dcfdr-axcreloki7ys.jpeg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Source: lh3.googleusercontent.com</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/353604/">https://habr.com/ru/post/353604/</a></p>
