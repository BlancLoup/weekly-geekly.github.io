Executive Director Dick Costollo said he planned to build the largest daily audience in the world, and also described how a company that has registered users with only a fifth of Facebook plans to achieve this. <br><br>  The main changes are the addition of the ability to upload videos and share them, as well as the improvement of personal messages and targeted notifications. <br><br>  The function ‚Äúwhile you were away‚Äù will appear on Twitter: it will tell you about user-interesting tweets that he might have missed while offline.

      Now the owners of fresh, newly registered accounts will see the instant timeline (instant tape) and immediately begin to read it.  To get access to it, you do not need to look for interesting accounts to which you want to subscribe.  Now newbies of the service are very frightening away this process. <br><br>  The task of Twitter is to create a service that can connect people and benefit any person in the world immediately after registration. <br><br>  Kostollo promised to increase the pace with which innovations appear.  Financial Director Anthony Noto listed three main tasks: strengthening the core of the audience, combating barriers to keeping people from consuming content, and delivering new applications and functions to attract users. <br><br>  The results of the analysis of the size of the service were shown.  The users were divided into three groups: 284 million registered accounts, site visitors who simply consume content without logging in with a username and password, and readers who see the built-in Twitter widgets on other sites. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d7e/954/ed1/d7e954ed17ad4c22ae8ada604bbfe1f2.jpg" align="right">  Half a billion people visit the site every month, but they do not register.  200 million people view a celebrity profile, say, Lady Gaga, but more than half leave the site.  Another 100 million per month follow the link to a specific tweet, but 70% immediately leaves.  In addition to these visits, Twitter widgets on other sites browse 185 billion times a quarter. <br><br>  All this is also a service audience, even if they are not registered on the site. <br><br>  And the company plans to encourage these people to create accounts.  Users will be offered more content related to what they are viewing now: if someone is watching Katy Perry's profile, then he will surely want to stay if he is shown information about other similar celebrity profiles. <br><br>  Google, Amazon and eBay have an income of more than 14 billion dollars.  Noto showed an ambitious schedule of planned earnings relative to the time elapsed after reaching a billion dollars in revenue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f2/4c6/ffb/3f24c6ffb2a54572a78304f0b8521716.jpg"><br><br>  On Twitter, they want to make the private messaging service better.  This can be very useful in the long run.  Now this area is entirely owned by Facebook and several other sites where users can chat. <br><br>  There will be investment in various applications like the Vine short video service purchased in October 2012.  Twitter wants to use the development strategy of several individual applications, which over the past year has already been adopted by Facebook and other companies. <br><br>  Earlier rates of slowing down the number of users of the microblogging service than expected had led to such changes.  It's funny that personal problems were talked about right in the audience.  One analyst complained that he abandoned the service after a recent registration: he did not like that he could not subscribe to certain topics, for example, technology and finance. <br><br>  In addition to the changes in the service itself over the last year, Costollo changed five large figures in the company's management. <br><br>  The positive reaction of the market can be judged by the price of the share of the microblogging service, which soared by 7.5%.  Last year was not the best for Twitter, the share price fell by 37%. <br><br>  According to the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2014/11/12/twitter-sharpens-strategy-to-win-over-investors/">Wall Street Journal</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362949/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362949/</a></p>
