We have extensive connections and long arms.  What is worth only our CEO - Arthur Baganov, co-founder of the American network of business angels Alliance of Angels, which has nearly 20 years of experience in the western venture capital market. <br>  In the case of Plug and Play Russia, we were lucky to be responsible for the preliminary selection of projects.  So before the finals you have to communicate with our specialists. <br><br><h5>  And returning to the present </h5><br>  The sequence of steps to become a resident of Plug and Play in Russia: <br>  1. <a href="http://globaltechin.com/attachments/anketa%2520plug%2520and%2520play.xls">Download</a> and fill out the form. <br>  2. Send the questionnaire to PlugandPlay@globaltechin.com until October 5, you receive confirmation from us that the questionnaire has been received. <br>  3. At this stage you do nothing.  At this time, our experts conduct an initial examination of projects.  Following the results, we invite (or do not invite) your team to a personal meeting. <br>  4. At a personal meeting (this is still a selection) for 15 minutes you talk about your project and answer questions. <br>  5. Here again you are not doing anything.  Receive (or not receive) an invitation to the final. <br>  6. Actually, the final.  15-minute presentation in English to Russian and international experts, and, essno, representatives of the Plug and Play. <br>  7. Profit!  At least for five teams. <br><br>  We are waiting for your applications!  We will be glad to see personally at the selection, and we will be glad separately if we meet in the final. <br>  If you have any questions about the competition - please ask. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/128785/">https://habr.com/ru/post/128785/</a></p>
