    <h4>  Where is the interest </h4><br>  We have been developing solutions for the foreign exchange market for 10 years, we like Bitcoin and we believe in the future of this currency.  Not so long ago, we <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tradingview/blog/132549/">launched Startup TradingView</a> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/tradingview/blog/178417/">were selected by Techstars</a> and are currently in the heart of the startup startup.  We have already connected data from Bitcoin to our charts of rltime, and now we are thinking how to develop this idea into something really worthwhile.  We did not decide what it would be, so I would like to share some thoughts in order to better understand what is happening. <br><br><h4>  Is it really necessary for someone? </h4><br>  At the moment, the infrastructure for Bitcoin transactions is just being built.  And investors are increasingly taking startups that are involved in this.  I studied this question a little and here are just a few examples of recent months. <br><br>  In <a href="http://www.new.bitinstant.com/">Bitinstant</a> invested $ 1.5M, in <a href="https://bitpay.com/">Bitpay</a> $ 2.5M, seven-digit amounts received <a href="http://paywithbits.com/">Paywithbits</a> , Coinbase, Consetter, CoinLab, Opencoin, Coindesk received more than 2M.  The 15-million <a href="http://libertycityventures.com/digital-currency-fund/">Digital Currency Fund</a> , which invests only in <a href="https://angel.co/bitcoin-opportunity-fund">Bitcoin</a> startups, was recently created, the <a href="https://angel.co/bitcoin-opportunity-fund">Bitcoin Opportunity Fund</a> is another example of a fund of such specialization, <a href="http://www.bitangels.co/">Bitangels</a> manages capital of 20M.  The creators of the startup Coinbase claim that they have already converted $ 15 million into Bitcoin and the volume of transactions is growing by 15% per week. <br><br><h4>  Is everything really so good? </h4><br>  Not really.  Despite the high interest in bitcoin, it seems no one really understands what it really is.  Depending on who you are talking to, bitcoin or predict the future of world currency or a quick crash.  There are really enough problems, ranging from sanctions from state regulators to 51% purely technical problems such as attacks. <br><br>  However, it is these conditions that create an ideal ecosystem for startups.  The entry threshold is not high, and large players are cautious and will not climb into this market until there is final clarity.  And if this clarity does come, then all the cream will be removed by those who have begun to act in the conditions of current uncertainty. <br><br><h4>  And what to do? </h4><br>  There are several main areas in which you can think. <br><br>  <b>Payment systems</b> <br>  The more popular Bitcoin becomes, the greater the need for payment systems.  Shops will need to accept bitcoins as payment, and this is a large and promising market. <br><br>  <b>Exchange</b> <br>  If Bitcoin develops as a currency, the need to exchange it for other currencies will grow.  It is unlikely that in the near future bitcoin will begin to trade in the interbank market, which means that a trading platform is needed. <br><br>  <b>Electronic Wallets</b> <br>  Similar to bank accounts, bitcoins need to be stored somewhere safely. <br><br>  <b>What have we done on TradingView?</b> <br>  At the moment we have connected to our charts riltaym and historical data on bitcoin.  Now you can watch Bitcoin rate in real time against major world currencies ( <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/e/%3Fsymbol%3DMTGOX:BTCRUB">there is a ruble</a> ) in real time.  We receive data from MGOX, we will write about the technical side of the question separately. <br><br>  Users not only analyze the charts, but also share ideas about the future of Bitcoin.  If you know the technical analysis, then it will be interesting for you to look through the ideas and get your own idea about the prospects of the Bitcoin price.  For example, <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/v/TP8UOJ3L/">here</a> or <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/v/G34lm4J6/">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9fe/a01/14b/9fea0114b363904cffb6b0aaa747f98f.png" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  What will we do next? </h4><br>  In the near future - to give the opportunity to trade Bitcoin directly from the chart.  Now such speculations can bring a good profit due to the large difference in rates on different exchanges (arbitrage).  But we will certainly go ahead and maybe try to start a Bitcoin startup that goes beyond TradingView. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/185536/">https://habr.com/ru/post/185536/</a></p>
