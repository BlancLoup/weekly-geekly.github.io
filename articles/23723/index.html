  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Creating a team to implement their projects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h2>  Preface. </h2>  First of all, I‚Äôm focusing on this post on those who 1) work at work for their uncle 2) don‚Äôt have acquaintances-friends of web-maniacs to create a startup. <br>  I propose to change this situation like this. <br><h2>  Preface. </h2>  To create a project you need a team of professionals or newbies obsessed with the project, for example.  But what to do when you are not yet a professional and you do not have friends of specialists in something.  What to do when there are friends, but they do not know how, and they do not have time to learn.  What to do if you are dependent on work and the time to create a project is simply not there. <br>  What we have?  People dependent on work.  People with disparate knowledge and skills.  With different views on the approach to development and experience. <br>  Decision. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Part 1. The problem of dependence on work. </h2>  First we solve the problem with the dependence on work.  The only way out is earnings freelance.  But finding customers and communicating with them takes time and effort.  Also if you can't do all the work you need partners. <br>  A web studio is being created.  Let's call it "Studio orders."  Who will be the staff of this studio?  For simplicity and clarity, let them be: Manager, Designer, Coder.  Let the income from the order is divided between employees in this way.  30% Manager, 30% designer, 30% coder, 10% in firm capital (For expenses and maintaining a studio, as well as for servers, hosting, etc.). <br>  If there are a lot of employees and few orders are introduced, a competitive basis for the order is introduced, which improves the quality of work performed by the studio and, accordingly, leads to an increase in orders and their cost. <br><h2>  Part 2. Forming a team and a single style of work. </h2>  Initially, a certain charter of one team is created. <br>  It includes: <br>  1) Skills <br>  2) Personality <br>  3) Working conditions <br>  4) Manifesto of the future "Project Studio" <br>  After the required number of team members to create the site is found, the team proceeds with the execution of orders in the Studio of Orders.  Develop relationships and methods of work. <br>  If the problem of money is not worth it and there are no orders, it is quite possible to create a couple of non-commercial projects (firstly, it is necessary because at first there will be no material issues) <br>  After the team members decide that the work is organized, they move into the third part. <br><br><h2>  Part 3. "Studio projects" </h2>  When creating such a studio, it is necessary at the very beginning to find out who on what conditions and on which projects he wants to work.  This should clarify a pre-written manifest.  The manifesto should consist of the developments and desires of the whole team.  Compromises must be reached. <br>  The ideas of projects in this case can be discussed after writing a non-disclosure agreement. <br><h2>  Part 4. "Charter".  (My) </h2>  Skills <br>  In fact, the main thing is not the tools but the quality of work, so here I will list what I learn and use. <br>  All this of course it is desirable to know, but you can learn.  And of course it is better to shove from it and get high. <br>  Ruby (rails, merb, capming ...) <br>  Postgresql <br>  BDD - behavior driven development <br>  Javascript <br>  Html, Css (Css frameworks (Blueprint Css)) <br>  Git, Track <br>  Mac os <br>  Textmate;) <br>  Web typography (just typography) <br>  Design (apple, lebedev, futurico;) ...) In general, if a person is a designer, he will understand everything already.  I am not a designer, I am very interested in them.  And I like 37signals and apple.  This is an allusion to future projects and their design;) <br>  Kiss <br>  English. <br>  Getting real <br>  Google <br>  And so on :) <br>  2) Personality <br>  Brain, hands, desire on the verge of a maniac to learn to find work. <br>  If you do not have motivation and you do not get pleasure from obtaining new knowledge, then this is bad. <br>  Openness to everything new. <br>  3) Working conditions <br>  All equally.  Because it will be our projects and everyone should be interested in his success personally.  Accordingly, a stranger will be allowed to the project only after working together on non-commercial projects or freelancers. <br>  4) Manifesto of the future "Project Studio" <br>  At the moment, I can not voice specifically on projects.  There are project ideas.  Sketches and more, but I can say that the implementation of projects will take place only after a complete description and writing of future business models.  And of course the projects will be selected by the whole team.  If the projects do not like it in principle, all this will be discussed. <br><h2>  Afterword. </h2>  So if it seems to you that you are the one I‚Äôm looking for, or are you interested in talking to, then write to me at badminus@gmail.com <br>  Yes, and Ruby is needed.  Unless of course you want to try with me.  If not, I hope the approximate search for like-minded people will help you. <br><br><h2>  After the afterword. </h2>  The text was written quickly.  Maybe I missed something or did not finish. <br>  This is my first post on this topic and it is quite long.  Previously, I did not write this and when expressing my thoughts in the text could be distorted.  :) </div>
