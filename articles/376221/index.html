We compiled a digest of smart gadgets that can measure heart rate, help cope with stress, and develop a training schedule.  Fitness trackers, smart watches and even bathroom scales with Bluetooth are on the shortlist. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/BiUq1mHoQsw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,1500003,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhjbo7XrYqS4LUBixT-16h5fdn4nKA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Jawbone up move </h4><br>  In early November, Jawbone introduced two new fitness trackers.  The flagship UP3 received a huge set of sensors (from the body temperature sensor to the sensor responsible for analyzing the composition of the human body) and a solid price of $ 179.  For those who have enough of the usual pedometer with the function of counting calories, Jawbone prepared Move - an affordable fitness tracker in the form of a puck.

The tracker is synchronized with the Smart Coach app (Android and iOS), takes into account daily activity, tracks sleep phases and works up to 6 months - thanks to replaceable batteries, eliminating the need to charge once a week. <br><br>  Instead of a full-fledged screen in UP Move, the LED circle is involved: the backlight can display the time and clearly demonstrate how much interest remains before the goal is completed for the day.  The device is protected from water, but not waterproof - this is expected for a budget tracker.  UP Move will come in five colors - purple, black, yellow, red and gray. <br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/fitnes-treker-jawbone-up-move/"><b>Jawbone UP Move at Madrobots.ru</b></a> <br><br><h4>  Sony SmartBand Talk </h4><br>  After the release of fairly simple fitness trackers, Sony has grown to a hybrid smart bracelet and smart watches.  SmartBand Talk is equipped with a permanently enabled e-ink screen, microphone, speaker and volume keys.  The main advantage in comparison with competitors is the ability to answer calls without getting the phone out of your pocket.  The sensitivity of the microphone and speaker volume is enough to not bring the SmartBand Talk to your mouth: difficulties can arise only in noisy places (for example, in the subway), where it will be difficult to hear the sound from the bracelet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3a4/157/a90/3a4157a90906447d8e9638bb856095c2.jpg"><br><br>  For all other parameters, SmartBand Talk is also at altitude: it interacts with Lifelog's proprietary application, it wakes up with vibration during the necessary sleep phase, withstands a trip to the shower (but not swimming), and also lives without an outlet for three days - an unattainable result for most smart hours.  Filling the battery up to 100% lasts about 40 minutes - you can not even remember about any nightly charges. <br><br>  The only serious disadvantage of SmartBand Talk is that it works exclusively with Android devices (version 4.4 and higher, Bluetooth 4.0 LE): if the Japanese had made the gadget multiplatform, it would have caused much more resonance. <br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/umnye_chasy/umnyy-braslet-sony-smartband-talk-swr30-black/"><b>Sony SmartBand Talk in Madrobots.ru</b></a> <br><br><h4>  Basis peak </h4><br>  The list of sensors and sensors is one of the most important characteristics for wearable gadgets.  Basis Peak has a rather strict appearance (no too bright elements), but this is not the main thing: the essence lies in the functionality.  The tracker 24 hours a day monitors the owner's pulse, controls the quality of sleep (and not just its duration), fixes the intensity of sweating and saves the number of calories burned.  Of course, without a standard pedometer, this was not done either - the distance traveled is displayed on an e-ink screen with an economical backlight.  The claimed autonomy is encouraging - 4-5 days, depending on the load. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7e/4aa/a3f/a7e4aaa3f0484f4185950be30352554e.jpg"><br><br>  Basis Peak guarantees performance when going to the shower and swimming neatly in the pool - the specified water resistance is at the level of 5 atmospheres.  Also, the list of advantages of the device includes support for the two most popular mobile operating systems: owners of devices running Android and iOS can simply download the application, connect to Peak and carefully analyze the data. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/umnye_chasy/umnye-chasy-basis-peak/">Basis Peak at Madrobots.ru</a></b> <br><br><h4>  Mio alpha 2 </h4><br>  The presentation of the second generation of smart heart rate monitors was held in Las Vegas: as part of CES-2015, Mio released a new version of the wrist accessory designed to track activity during training.  In comparison with the first version, the Alpha 2 received a backlight, an advanced stopwatch and an accelerometer, but the main feature is preserved: this gadget measures the pulse with minimal error without uncomfortable chest accessories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/17c/278/f01/17c278f01b914600a46e6bed8e721d96.jpg"><br><br>  Alpha 2 syncs with many fitness apps for iOS and Android: these include Mio Go, Strava, RunKeeper and MapMyRun.  Data on the rhythm of heartbeats are transmitted to the smartphone along with information about the pace of running and the distance traveled.  Alpha 2‚Äôs water resistance is typical - showers, sinks and careful (and unwanted) dives into the pool.  The battery capacity is enough for 20 hours with heart rate monitoring turned on, and without it, the device can work up to three months. <br><br>  <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/pulsometr-mio-alpha-2/"><b>Mio Alpha 2 in Madrobots.ru</b></a> <br><br><h4>  Zensorium Tinke </h4><br>  An unusual health monitoring gadget connects to your smartphone via Bluetooth.  After that, the compact Tinke shines through the skin of the finger with an emitter, and the sensor monitors the blood flow in the capillaries: all this is needed to determine the frequency of breaths / breaths, measure the pulse and determine heart rate variability. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fea/7ba/4f7/fea7ba4f7ba949638b3bfd44420012c0.jpg"><br><br>  Tinke has two main modes.  The first, called Vita, monitors the intensity of training and indicates how to distribute the load - relax or add activity.  The second mode is Zen: Tinke analyzes the breath and suggests a new rhythm that will help cope with stress.  Of course, all medical records are saved in the section with statistics.  Tinke weighs only 11 grams and fits perfectly in a pocket for a lighter, which is on almost all jeans.  One charging device is enough for 100 measurements. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/tinke-universalnyy-datchik-zdorovya-dlya-android">Zensorium Tinke for Android at Madrobots.ru</a></b> <br><br>  <b><a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/tinke/">Zensorium Tinke for iOS at Madrobots.ru</a></b> <br><br><h4>  Runtastic Libra </h4><br>  Ordinary bathroom scales gain intelligence after connecting to a smartphone (iOS, Android from 4.3) and registering with the Runtastic system.  The fourth link adds to the standard ‚Äúgot up - waited - remembered weight‚Äù: the application gives a summary of the ratio of adipose tissue, muscle mass, bone mass and tissues in the body.  Another Libra displays the percentage of fluid in the body, prescribes the mass index and calculates how many calories the user should consume per day.  For the most goal-oriented in the application there is a point ‚Äúgoals‚Äù: ‚Äã‚Äãthere are set tasks for losing weight or getting rid of adipose tissue. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/490/dcc/5fa/490dcc5fa0f14513b6938f25aaeeb252.jpg"><br><br>  Smart scales support a maximum weight of 180 kilograms (that is, even a thinner Vasily Utkin can use) and work with 8 unique accounts.  At the same time, Libra themselves determine who stood up on them, even if there are other Runtastic members in the Bluetooth zone. <br><br>  <b><a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/tsifrovye-diagnosticheskie-vesy-runtastic-runsca1/">Runtastic Libra at Madrobots.ru</a></b> <br><br>  <i>Material prepared by: <a href="https://twitter.com/gorodnitskiy">Pavel Gorodnitsky</a> , <a href="https://twitter.com/ivan_belousov">Ivan Belousov</a></i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/376221/">https://habr.com/ru/post/376221/</a></p>
