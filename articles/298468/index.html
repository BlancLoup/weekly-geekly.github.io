But it is necessary. <br>  The fact is that for business reasons I have to not only write texts for my company's page on Facebook, but also read what competitors write on their pages.  And often the mistakes that they make when doing this are so coarse (albeit long ago described by SMM marketing gurus) that I decided to list them all. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Entertainment information</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúMotivate by influencing life principles and attitudes‚Äù, ‚Äú5 Golden Rules of an Effective Speaker‚Äù and ‚Äú15 non-obvious tools for designers‚Äù and other articles of a small volume of various topics.</i>

      People are my dear, what are you, online media?  Or maybe bloggers?  Among the products that you sell, there is not one for designers (and, by the way, for speakers too). <br><br>  Perhaps you will thus gather a large group of people who are interested in reading any garbage.  But none of you will buy anything from you.  And will not recommend a colleague / boss. <br><br>  That is, the SMM manager will cheerfully report on the results in the form of group growth, but this will not affect sales. <br><br>  <b>2. Articles not on a profile</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúSocial engineering coupled with phishing is one of the ways to steal valuable information,‚Äù ‚ÄúBelgian bank Crelan was the victim of a phishing attack that caused damage of 70 million euros,‚Äù ‚Äú10 loud information leaks‚Äù and other reprints and translations of domestic and foreign publications.</i> <br><br>  It is completely incomprehensible how all this information will allow to sell the employee monitoring system?  Monitoring that, rescues from phishing?  Monitoring does not save monitoring information leaks, but there‚Äôs not a word in the article about it. <br><br>  That is, the SMM manager is trying to form an audience that would be interested in reading about security problems, and then in other posts, slip information about discounts and promotions to them.  Will not work. <br><br>  First, what is this audience?  Such info is not interesting to safe people, they already know about the problem, they need a solution.  If the leaders read it once, they will immediately go to the security men to find out what the solutions to these problems are.  It is unlikely that a safe monitoring system will be offered ... <br><br>  That is, imitation of Internet media is happening again.  True, even with less success than in the previous case.  So many likes as in paragraph 1 is no longer collected. <br><br>  <b>3. Do you know what ...?</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúDid you know that 70% of companies suffered from information leaks over the past 12 months,‚Äù ‚ÄúThe American Fast Company conducted a survey and found out what office employees are most distracted by‚Äù, ‚ÄúIn 15% of Russian companies, all HR processes are processed manually ! "- and other" pugalki "without any specific recipes.</i> <br><br>  But I know that the ancestors of the whales once lived on land.  And how will this information help me in managing the company?  Approximately the same as knowledge of the fact that 70% of companies suffered from leaks. <br><br>  We live in a world full of information.  And such texts will attract attention only if the manager understands - this is about him, about his company.  But then comes a specific recipe - what to do!  And if the recipe includes the purchase of a personnel monitoring system (or a CRM system, a new office furniture, a secretary ...), then it will buy. <br><br>  <b>4. Primitive advertising</b> <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúOffice staff often surf the Internet and social networks?</i>  <i>Learn how to make it so that it not only does not affect the productivity of work and the achievement of a goal, but, on the contrary, increases the efficiency of the whole team! ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  People who write such posts seemed to read my point number 3, but understood it too literally.  Imagine that you are buying a book "How to repair a fence," open it, and there is a hammer advertisement.  What a weighty he is, how well he clogs nails, how shining, how nice it is to build a fence with his help.  And about how to measure boards, saw, hammer off - two paragraphs. <br><br>  Such articles should be placed so that it was immediately visible - this is advertising.  This does not cause high expectations and allows you to be sure that those who open your post are really looking for a similar tool and want to read about it. <br><br>  <b>5. Product Information</b> <br><br>  <i>Hooray!</i>  <i>We have a new version with a bunch of functionality !!!</i> <br><br>  Well, congratulations to you.  So what? <br>  If you want to notify existing customers - send a newsletter to the database bought.  If fluctuating potential customers - on the basis of downloaded trial.  The rest is what is useful? .. <br><br>  <b>‚ÄúYou can all criticize ...‚Äù</b> <br><br>  ... but I will not deliberately talk about how to do it.  Smart books and articles have been written about this, by people who are much more experienced than me. <br><br>  But I will give one example. <br><br>  In mid-January, the European Court of Human Rights (European Court of Human Rights) ruled that employers have every right to control what an employee is doing on his work computer.  Here is the original news on the BBC portal: <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35301148">www.bbc.com/news/technology-35301148</a> . <br><br>  Each company-manufacturer of employee monitoring systems reprinted this news.  Just reprinted.  It seems like with a hint - everything is now allowed. <br><br>  The company must sell each.  So, the SMM-manager should also sell.  Then his work will make sense.  Otherwise there will be only meaningless likes and reposts ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2df/049/48a/2df04948aba94fa893867968da0b0ea1.jpg"></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298468/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298468/</a></p>
