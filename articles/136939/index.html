  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Ubuntu developers presented an innovative alternative to traditional menus.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Mark Shuttleworth introduced the new 'Head-Up Display' (HUD) menu system, which preaches radically different methods and can replace the usual nested menu system that has existed in the computer industry for over 30 years.  Now, instead of traveling through numerous drop-down menus to search for the desired application or command, the HUD system will offer users to simply type in the search box what they want to do.  During the command set process, the system will automatically select and suggest the most likely program names from applications available in the system or commands available in the regular menu of the current application. <br><br><img src="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Pangolin_matrix_v1-3e.png" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In each case, the HUD will try to guess as accurately as possible what the user wants, for that he will memorize all previous associations between the entered and the running, each time adjusting to the specific style of the user.  In any case, each time the HUD will offer a set of the closest options, allowing you to choose exactly what you need.  For example, the set of the letter combination ‚Äúrad‚Äù will offer the ‚ÄúRadial blur‚Äù command in the GIMP application; when you enter ‚ÄúD‚Äù, you will be offered to delete the file or edit the properties of the document. <br><br>  Mark Shuttleworth believes that it will be much easier to learn new software from HUD, as well as to migrate new users with Windows, without having to re-understand the new menu structure for them (it is assumed that HUD is much more intuitive and clearer than traditional nested menus ).

First, the HUD system will provide a standard way of access for all commands, including those that are rarely used, for which, as a rule, there is no graphical representation in the system from the hierarchical menus.  Secondly, Mark believes that this approach allows you to see all commands, both systemic and your own set of application commands, in a logically unified space.  Now, any internal application team is at the same level of ‚Äúnesting‚Äù as any other, which unites all the system functionality (one of the main goals of the Unity interface concept). <br><br>  Both the old and the new approach have their advantages and disadvantages.  Mark believes that a lot of time is spent on work in the traditional graphic menu.  Sometimes the search for something can be very long, if there are many applications and the user does not remember where exactly what is needed is located.  HUD allows you to instantly ‚Äúreach out‚Äù to any application, remembering at least part of its name.  Mark also believes that if the hotkeys partly solved this problem, then the HUD interface will be easier anyway, as it is always easier to remember a short keyword (or several such words to choose from), a part of the program name or some of its separate commands. than faceless key combination. <br><br>  The disadvantage of a HUD is that it requires a clear understanding of what the user wants.  Using HUD also increases the load on the user's memory and requires much more interaction with the keyboard, but given the tendency of Linux users to console, this approach looks quite rational.  But, despite all this, the old visual menu will still be saved, coexisting in parallel with the HUD. <br><br>  Thus, according to Mark, HUD is likely to be introduced for the first time in Ubuntu 12.04, and will be available in all standard Ubuntu applications that support the global menu.  Support for traditional menus will be preserved in full, the HUD system will optionally be included.  In the currently available test releases of Ubuntu 12.04, you can install a HUD from the unity-team / hud PPA repository (sudo add-apt-repository ppa: unity-team / hud; sudo apt-get update &amp;&amp; sudo apt-get dist- upgrade).  The HUD interface is activated by pressing the Alt key. <br><br>  But HUD in this form is just the beginning.  The second logical step is voice recognition, when the same commands can be given by voice.  In fact, the current ‚Äúintermediate implementation‚Äù of the HUD is a preliminary adaptation of the graphical interface to the future voice control, which is the main and final goal of all planned transformations. <br><br>  The HUD approach pursues its main conceptual goal of clearing the working space of the monitor from cluttering up controls (as opposed to how it is done in products based on the Microsoft Ribbon concept), on the one hand to allow the computer user to fully concentrate on the application workspace, but on the other hand, to make any command of the system as easy and fast as possible. <br><br>  Via <a href="http://www.opennet.ru/opennews/art.shtml%3Fnum%3D32886">opennet.ru</a> <br>  Source <a href="http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/939">www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/939</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/136939/">https://habr.com/ru/post/136939/</a></p>
