If everything suits you - you do not change anything.  Man always strives for such ideal stability, but, unfortunately, does not exist.  There were so harsh times that entire nations <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2">rose from their homes</a> and set off in search of a new home. <br><br>  So I lived for a long time and did not know the grief: I lived in the edges of the Window, in places that were called XP.  This idyll lasted long enough from the very appearance of Windows XP.  Years passed, Vista came out.  She, like a child with Down syndrome, has become a burden for the Windows family.  The seven loomed on the horizon ... Magic number 7!  And now more and more of my friends switched to the new system. <br><br>  I understood that sitting on Hapeshka forever will not succeed, that it is necessary to go on, develop, in the end!  And here I am faced with a dilemma.  Firstly, my computer is not fast.  Secondly, and so few resources eagerly devoured Kaspersky.  Thirdly, I believe that retribution will surely come, and everyone using pirated Windows will be called to answer.  The answer to my question was obvious - I put Linux! <a name="habracut"></a>

      I have tried to install Linux before.  Then it was Linux Mint 6 and Alt Linux.  But the lack of Internet in a rented apartment predetermined the fate of these distributions.  Now that high-speed Internet has become available for me and the opportunity to download updates, drivers and codecs, I was not afraid of anything ... Almost nothing.  Anyone who wanted to install Linux on his own would have to deal with IT.  THIS is a certain mythologized image of Linux, fanned by fear and horror, that anyone who dares to leave Winda will have to face.  Linux is a plague.  If you become infected, then irreversible changes will begin: you will cover with acne, acquire a beard and put on huge glasses.  And many believe it.  It is obvious that the myth was created by Windows adepts.  They do not represent life outside the system.  And she is ... <br><br>  Life is, and the organisms that live here are not primitive.  Before me appeared such a number of distributions that Windows users never dreamed of.  And they did not differ in the name of Home Edition or Professional.  Distry is really different and each is unique in its own way.  Which one to choose?  Here, as with a car: you can choose an exclusive, but do not count on the support of the service center, but you can choose a popular model, and you will not know the problems with spare parts and maintenance.  Open distrowatch.org and make sure - the flagship desktop Linux - Ubuntu. <br><br>  By this time, I already had the Asus 1005P netbook, so I boldly set about experimenting, not worrying about the usual tasks on my desktop PC.  I downloaded Ubuntu 10.04 and began to settle down.  As I expected, there was nothing wrong with Linux.  Already in the CD version, which I put from a flash drive, there is everything to perform typical tasks.  Windows cannot boast of a built-in Office, an image processing program, an email client, an ICQ client, and a bunch of other small amenities.  Strangely enough, this installed software will be enough for the absolute majority of average users.  The only thing that needs to be done is to install codecs and complete Russification.  Everything passes automatically and there is no need to climb into the command line. <br>  But for me this was clearly not enough.  I installed the programs one by one, deleted, installed again, in one word - I studied everything that the endless world of Open Source can offer.  It is worth noting that I don‚Äôt play games, so I didn‚Äôt have such an important point in the failing transition to Linux.  What was my surprise when I discovered a full-fledged beautiful network 3D-shooters, and most importantly - free.  In general, everything in Linux is free.  I do not need to buy CDs, I do not need to look for keys and break programs.  My karma is pure.  And do not forget how crooked it is often ‚Äúcracked‚Äù software, as it takes longer and longer to wait for ‚Äúcracked‚Äù versions, and some specialized products simply cannot be found! <br><br>  When I got a little settled down and understood all the disadvantages of a ten-inch display, I remembered the Ubuntu Netbook Edition and installed this version.  Honestly, I'm amazed so far.  I have never seen anything like it.  There is no better option for small displays.  But the speed of work has ceased to satisfy me.  It works une slower.  I returned to normal Ubuntu again, I used it for about a month and cooled down.  Our honeymoon is over.  No, I was not convinced that Windows was still better, by no means.  I just did not see the raisin.  In search of "dried grapes" I went to another popular distro - Linux Mint. <br><br>  I thought so: Ubuntu is fine, but Shuttleworth is not a good person.  The solution is ‚Äúdoped Ubuntu‚Äù, i.e. Mint.  In Mint, I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that all codecs are already out of the box.  You will only need to download the Russification.  In addition, here I have not encountered such problems with the notification applet.  Oh, how much blood he drank from me in Ubuntu!  There was a case when all the widgets from the notification applet flew off at all.  It's all easier.  Minus was found and for me is very amazing.  It turned out that the standard Ubuntu menu with the division into "Applications", "Transition" and "Administration" is much more convenient than what was offered by Mint.  And this is despite the fact that he is often rejected in favor of the classic ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù.  Therefore, in Minta, I organized a desktop using Cairo Dock, a mac-like panel that unconditionally won compared to Docky and Avant Window Navigator. <br><br>  But I did not stop at that either.  I went ahead and installed Open Suse 11.3.  The system was slow.  Very slow.  Although there were pluses in it.  I was pleased with the power manager, which allows you to set energy saving profiles not only for the brightness of the display, but also for the power of the processor.  However, if you put your first Linux on a PC, this is not an important argument for you.  I liked the fact that the system tray was made by one widget, unlike Ubuntu with its notification applet.  Thanks to this solution, all settings are in one place.  Russification out of the box turned out to be the most complete of all the distr I have tried.  Plasma, a desktop on a desktop, remained completely incomprehensible to me.  What the creators wanted to say with this, I could not understand right away.  Already in the standard version you can switch to the interface for netbooks.  But at first glance it is clear that it is not as convenient as in the UNR.  The process of splitting disks is more complicated than in the two above-described distros.  The user is offered a much larger number of installation settings, which, in other matters, do not say anything to the beginner.  There is another incident with Suse.  After the download of updates and codecs, which took 700 mb (like the distribution itself), the system still refused to play mp3 files.  Sadly.  All these shortcomings do not mean that Open Suse is a bad distribution.  Simply, if it is intuitively incomprehensible, it means that it cannot claim the title of ‚ÄúMy first Linux‚Äù.  Mastodon need to understand that the line - the lot of professionals.  In order for Linux to become popular at home and in the office, so that ordinary people can use it, each action will require a graphic representation in the form of a button. <br><br>  At this my search did not stop.  I downloaded Fedora 13. You will be kindly offered versions with all four graphical skins on one site.  There is no dilution on Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu ... Just the creators warn that the main thing for them is Gnome.  Even at the life-CD stage, I had concerns.  For example, the absence of Office in the standard build says a lot: in all previous distributions it was.  Point set the installation process.  During previous installations, at the moment when you select a language, the interface switches to it.  Here it did not happen.  Further more.  Instead of the intuitive disk layout manager Ubuntu and Mint, instead of the sophisticated manager Sues, I saw ... I saw nothing.  The system asked something about the disks, while offering me to choose my hard drive, but refusing to remove the tick from the flash drive.  Will the flash drive be mounted as a hard drive?  In general, Fedor also proved to be unsuitable for a beginner. <br><br>  Then I came to an end.  By the end of the list of the most famous distros. And although Mandriva still remained, she immediately offended that the DVD version was paid.  In addition, as far as I know, the company itself has problems.  So I decided to try Linux Mint 9 with the LXDE shell, since  both KDE and Gnome were far from perfect. <br><br>  LXDE was pleased with the fast work.  Outwardly, she recalled the mix with Suse, where the file manager is used for navigation, and not the many folders ‚ÄúMy Computer‚Äù, ‚ÄúHome Folder‚Äù and others as desired.  The start button is very concise.  Upset the lack of OpenOffice.  Instead, AbWord.  And in general, create some kind of confusion.  In place of the task manager, we see Xfce Taskmanager, from a completely different shell.  A lot of gnome applications.  For a beginner, it remains a mystery why different software and different packages are needed for different shells?  Therefore, based on considerations of practicality, you should choose the popular KDE and Gnome shells.  No, of course the applications work in each other, and Kopete can be installed under Gnome.  But it is like the work of an office worker in a collective farm field.  It will work, but the environment is still not his. <br><br>  What can I summarize?  I will select Mint under Gnome.  Although by the time I returned to Mint, all four shells had already appeared.  This is an ideal solution for a newbie who wants to switch from Windows with the least psychological trauma.  The creators themselves are positioning it.  Although Ubuntu option for a newbie is also very decent.  Why?  The community of the latter is disproportionately larger.  Work is being done more actively, and help comes immediately.  The ideal distribution does not happen, but after evaluating everything, I realized that I want to see in my ideal distro.  But Linux is different in that it can be changed quite strongly.  How this ends, time will tell. <br><br><h6>  PS </h6><br><h4>  If you also install Linux from a flash drive, I will share my observations.  First, I never managed to install the DVD version.  Never.  Secondly, I tried many programs, but did not find it universal: WinSetup was suitable only for Ubuntu, Win32diskimager was installed by Suse and Fedora, Universal USB Installer was the only Mint under Windows, and the standard Ubuntovsky creator of boot disks was very easy and without any settings I created a bootable USB flash drive with Mint, while immediately offering a list of .iso images on the computer. </h4></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99909/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99909/</a></p>
