Including he voiced impressive numbers on Android, Chrome and Google+. <br><br>  Although technically it was his first press conference for the full quarter as chief executive officer, the past was remembered for saying only a few phrases on it.  This time he made a very confident speech and even stayed to answer questions.  In addition, he even <a href="https://plus.google.com/106189723444098348646/posts/dRtqKJCbpZ7">posted his speech on Google+</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the actual financial results.  Google's revenue for the second quarter amounted to a record 9.03 billion dollars, which is 32% more than in the second quarter of last year.  Revenue is indicated without deducting the cost of acquiring traffic.

      Google‚Äôs own sites in the second quarter brought Google revenues of $ 6.23 billion, representing 69% of total revenues.  This is 39% more than in the second quarter of last year.  Partner sites through AdSense in the second quarter brought Google revenue in the amount of 2.48 billion dollars, which represents 28% of total revenues.  This is 20% more compared to the second quarter of last year. <br><br>  Revenues from outside the United States amounted to $ 4.87 billion, representing 54% of total revenues in the second quarter, an increase of 2% from the second quarter of 2010. <br><br>  Collectively, paid clicks on Google and AdSense partner sites increased by about 18% from the second quarter of 2010, but decreased by about 2% from the first quarter of 2011.  The average cost per click increased by about 12% compared with the second quarter of 2010 and about 6% compared with the first quarter of 2011. <br><br>  The cost of acquiring traffic ‚Äî part of the revenue that goes to Google‚Äôs partners ‚Äî increased to $ 2.11 billion in the second quarter of 2011 from 1.73 in the second quarter of 2010. <br><br>  As of June 30, 2011, cash, cash equivalents and liquid securities of Google totaled $ 39.1 billion. <br><br>  Worldwide, Google has 28,768 full-time employees as of June 30, 2011, compared with 26,316 full-time employees as of March 31, 2011. <br><br>  More details and financials can be found <a href="http://investor.google.com/earnings/2011/Q2_google_earnings.html">here</a> . <br><br>  After the publication of the financial report, Google shares rose by 12%.  If the revenue from ad networks was at the expected level, then the revenue from Google sites exceeded expectations. <br><br>  We turn to other numbers.  Larry Page reported that 550,000 Android devices are now being activated per day.  And just 16 days before this number was 500 thousand!  The growth rate of Android is increasing by 4.4% per week.  In the first quarter of this year, the number of activations per week was 350 thousand, and in the second quarter of 2010 - 160 thousand.  Impressive? <br><br>  Total Android is used on 130 million devices, and the number of downloads from the Android Market is six billion.  During the I / O conference in May, Android was used on 100 million devices.  For comparison, at the time of the June WWDC, the iOS platform was used on 200 million devices. <br><br>  Chrome uses more than 160 million people. <br><br>  Launched this year, the +1 button is already used 2.3 billion times a day. <br><br>  In the social project Google+, according to Page, more than 10 million users have already registered, and these users create a billion entries every day.  It is worth recalling that Google+ was launched just two weeks ago.  10 million users is 1.3% of 750 million Facebook users.  For two weeks! <br><br>  Paige said that he divides products into three separate categories.  First, this search and advertising products - the main source of income for the company.  Secondly, these are products that are very popular among consumers - YouTube, Android and Chrome.  Google invests in them with the expectation of long-term success.  And finally, new products - Google+, commercial and local services.  In these, Google invests to stimulate innovation. <br><br>  "All of us at Google want to create services that people around the world would use twice a day ... like a toothbrush!" <br><br>  [via <a href="http://investor.google.com/earnings/2011/Q2_google_earnings.html">Google Investor Relations</a> , <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/14/larry-page-earnings-call-google-plus/">TechCrunch</a> , <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/larry-page-really-took-charge-today-2011-7">Business Insider</a> ] </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124287/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124287/</a></p>
