  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sravnit.ru - bypass crises side</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  One of the main tasks for the developers of Comparing.ru was to create a set of calculators that can accurately <a href="http://www.sravni.ru/strahovka/">calculate the cost of comprehensive insurance policies and CTP insurance</a> , profitability of bank deposits, the amount of overpayment on loans, and most importantly - to compare all these products with each other. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  For its implementation, each product was divided into many components.  For example, a contribution ‚Äî its characteristics are: bank, name, size, currency, term, interest rate, capitalization, withdrawal and replenishment options, and additional conditions.  Data is stored in a number of MS SQL databases, taking into account both the requirements for the complexity and at the same time the flexibility of the data described, and the speed of access to them.  The created algorithms implemented in C # in ASP.NET, calculate the yield of the contribution day by day - the movement of funds accumulated over time is simulated.  The result is a finite amount of income broken down by the date on which interest accrues. <br><br>  Another algorithm is invented when calculating the Casco policy.  To obtain price quotes for insurance policies for some companies, web services and special calculation modules are used.  Unfortunately, most insurance companies in Russia are too far from creating an API or similar mechanisms.  To give the user an absolutely exact price for the policy, Excel files are used, exactly the same as the agents of insurance companies use.  Implemented API that allows you to connect to the calculation files, reduce incoming and outgoing parameters, facilitating the process of updating tariffs.

      For parallel calculation of several quotes and system resilience to various kinds of problems, a cluster of virtual machines causing Microsoft Excel and other external programs is implemented.  All this allows in real time to get the exact cost of insurance - the same as that received by the agent of the insurance company when calculating the cost of the policy, but an order of magnitude faster.  If earlier the calculations took about 1 minute, then the scheme developed by the programmers of the Comparison.ru allows you to achieve results in just a few seconds.  When creating the service, products from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/About/ru-RU/">Microsoft BizSpark were used</a> , which helped to build the project infrastructure at the highest level. <br><br>  The main, if not decisive, role is played by the accuracy and relevance of information on the cost of services and companies that provide them.  This information is subject to constant changes: interest rates on deposits grow, special offers appear, requirements for borrowers decrease, new branches of banks open, tariffs vary depending on the region, and so on.  The relevance and updating of information is monitored by a group of remote specialists consisting of 12 people.  All this gives the output excellent service, which is used daily by tens of thousands of people. <br><br>  People want to save money - and this Compare.Ru is a great helper.  Active work in this direction was noted by the professional community.  Following the results of 2010, Sravnit.ru became the winner of the ‚ÄúRunet Prize‚Äù in the nomination ‚ÄúEconomy and Business‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/132922/">https://habr.com/ru/post/132922/</a></p>
