  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How Macsolutions my laptop repaired. Part two</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Do you think that <a href="http://nicque.habrahabr.ru/blog/94942/">this</a> story is over?  No matter how! <br>  A written complaint was brought to Maksolyushens, written with the help of the Hep- <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/nepofigist/" class="user_link">man Nepofigist</a> , which was supposed to make the repair process a little livelier.  In fact, it turned out quite the opposite. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Go hand to hand </h4><br>  Without concealing surprise, serviceman Ilya signed a complaint to me in two copies, as it should be.  I hoped I gave the hard drive, which, at my request, was removed from the laptop before being sent for repair - I wrote my dissertation, and the data was very important to me.  Again, in words, I was promised that in two or three days the laptop would be repaired, and the director would consider the claim (it was on Monday). <br>  It is said, but the <s>fig is</s> not done.  In (attention, habrachelovek!) Friday I had to call myself and find out where my aluminum friend was.  The phone was picked up by the general director Ilya, who stated that the laptop was not repaired at the moment (note: the payment arrived on May 28), the claim was received and is being considered, and I will also have to pay for the customs duty paid for the imported part.  To my question, on what basis did they charge me for warranty repairs, I was given a disarming response to disgrace: "You do not pay for the part, but you pay for the delivery and customs fees." <br><h4>  Cavalry enters </h4><br>  I didn‚Äôt want to do this, but I had to call Apple‚Äôs Russian office and find out if the actions of the service center were legitimate.  The girl Victoria undertook to investigate this case, taking the contacts of the Maksolyushens and the number of repairs for me, as well as some personal data for further communication with me.  After 10 minutes, the bell rang, during which Victoria reported that (attention, habrachelovek!) About any additional payments I did not speak to the Maxwell;  there is also no reason to collect money for customs clearance in case of warranty repair, and if I receive an invoice when I receive my laptop, I will need to contact Apple representative on the spot, and experts will quickly solve my problem.  On the question of whether I‚Äôm charged penalties for such a long repair according to the law on consumer rights, Victoria described the situation as follows: <br>  1. The item is covered by an extended warranty of 3 years from the date of purchase; <br>  2. Yes, the part will be replaced free of charge during this period, even if there is no warranty for the device itself; <br>  3. No, no interest will be paid to me, since the repair (!) Is not a guarantee (see clause 1); <br>  4. The Consumer Rights Act does not concern them;  they cannot give any comments on this subject; <br>  5. But they can give for free 1 year warranty for any damage that occurred even because of my fault. <br>  I am not a vandal, not a masochist, etc., in order to consciously break my beloved laptop and wait for it to be repaired.  As it has already become clear, no one will give me any compensation for such a long repair, and, in fact, they didn‚Äôt want to spit what is written in ZOZPP.  In parallel, I sent a request to Rospotrebnadzor with a detailed description of the problem.  At the moment my letter is in the Moscow branch of Rospotrebnadzor, and the Maxoluences have time left until Wednesday to make a decision on my claim. </div>
