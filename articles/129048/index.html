I want to share with all this experience and details of its selection and installation.  I think that many will be useful. <br><br>  <b>Alarm selection</b> <br>  At first, I analyzed the available options and realized that GSM alarm would suit me.  Attempts to choose something ready and complete in stores like OBI I left pretty quickly, because  The fact that it is sold there is quite expensive, fairly Chinese and not suitable for my task of recruiting components. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5ff/203/5a9/5ff2035a97610abbecfe6ed32a9d00f5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <font>Head alarm device.</font>

      On the Internet, I read about GSM-alarm and began to look for sites of sellers.  As a result, one office was found, which offered several head units to choose from and to them - all sorts of sensors and other bundles.  The price of the head unit of 4,000 rubles suited me completely and I began to estimate what is required for the purchase. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Design</b> <br>  You can get into my house through two doors (the first is on the terrace, the second is the entrance to the house itself) and through the windows on the first floor.  On the second floor there is a staircase located in a large room of the house. <br><br>  Based on this, I decided that it would be sufficient to establish three lines of protection: <br><br><ul><li>  The first <u>sensor (movement)</u> stands near the front door to the house and monitors the movement in front of it.  It is impossible to get closer to the house than 10-15 meters so that the sensor does not work. </li><li>  On both doors are <u>sensors opening</u> .  Any opening of the door will trigger them. </li><li>  In the entrance room with a ladder there is <u>a motion sensor</u> .  Accordingly, moving around the house without triggering an alarm is impossible. </li></ul><br><br>  I did not put the sensors on the windows and did not take other types of sensors - fire, temperature and gas analyzers, because I did not consider it necessary.  At the same time, I forgot to buy a portable microphone for listening to the premises, and regret it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f17/209/33a/f1720933aa06d47dc56f28478eb419ed.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <font>Motion sensor on the street in front of the entrance.</font>  <font>There he is, white, on the left above the door.</font> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/800/ae0/397/800ae0397562a6c8d3c0c6eec7d4b412.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <font>Door opening sensor</font> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7cb/266/7cd/7cb2667cd611dc81d908030112f99f76.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <font>Motion sensor in the entrance room.</font>  <font>Circled in green circle.</font> <br><br>  <b>Acquisition</b> <br>  As I wrote above, the purchase in the store immediately disappeared, because  it is quite difficult to purchase something suitable for a complete set and the price there.  Therefore, together with the manager of the online store, we have formed an order.  In the installation, of course, easier to use wireless sensors, because  they do not require wiring.  But I was stopped by the fact that a battery was installed in each sensor (finger or ‚ÄúKrona‚Äù) and I am not sure that they will be able to survive the cold winter without replacement.  Of course, this complicates the installation of the system, but gives hope that it will not shut down due to the weather. <br><br>  When buying it is important not to forget about a number of additional things, without which it would be difficult for you to mount the system: <br><ul><li>  <u>Extra battery</u> .  Allows alarm to work when power is turned off.  It is stated that he will be able to feed her for 12 hours, but I did not check, because  such long outages have not yet been.  It costs about 500 rubles.  Bought in the same place where the alarm. </li><li>  <u>Box for the battery and bag</u> .  I took a small one, but I had to cut holes in it with a file, because everything fit in quite badly.  Before buying, estimate what will be inside. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/73d/c17/bc1/73dc17bc156a3d9330719b7c2ee6b574.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <font>At the top of the power supply, the bottom is the battery.</font> <br><ul><li>  <u>Wire for installation</u> .  This is a thin four-wire cable especially for low-voltage systems.  It is profitable to buy a bay at 100 meters, because  I took 80 meters to my house. I bought it there. </li><li>  <u>Braid removal tongs.</u>  Because  you have to strip a lot of wires, then doing it with your hands is rather inconvenient.  Sold in OBI. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b30/fb2/c75/b30fb2c753878e38cbc82d56d8145462.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <font>Braid removal tongs.</font>  <font>Very useful tool.</font> <br><ul><li>  <u>Soldering iron, tin, rosin</u> .  The ends of the wires and the terminals of the sensors, of course, need to be soldered, and not twisted. </li><li>  <u>Screwdriver with a narrow sting</u> (large hour) for fastening the wires to the back block of the alarm, <u>nippers</u> , <u>pliers</u> , <u>screws</u> and a <u>screwdriver</u> for trimming wires and mounting sensors.  <u>Drill</u> if you need to pass the wall. </li><li>  <u>Colored electrical tape</u> .  Because  you will eventually have quite a lot of wires converging to the head unit, then you will need to understand exactly which one is responsible for what.  To do this, I marked the end of the wire at the sensor and the end of the wire at the alarm head unit with one of the colors, stuck a piece of tape in the instructions for the alarm and signed which of the wires was responsible for what.  Otherwise I can‚Äôt imagine how I would put all this into the block.  A set of electrical tape for 10 colors sold in OBI rubles for 100. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea2/d3b/c67/ea2d3bc67b5c103beb59ed71ca08052a.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <font>A bunch of wires from the sensors on the way to the head unit.</font>  <font>Without colored tape on wiring to get confused is simple.</font> <br><ul><li>  <u>Multimeter</u>  It does not hurt to ring the line if something does not work.  Sold in OBI.  It is worth 200 rubles. </li><li>  <u>SIM card</u> .  I have a confident coverage only from Megaphone at the country house, so there were no alternatives.  You need to choose a tariff plan with no monthly fees and with the cheapest SMS. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Trial installation</b> <br>  After the courier brought me an order (about 7,000 rubles in total), I decided to do a trial assembly in the kitchen.  This allowed us to practice, to understand some peculiarities and, most importantly, not to suffer with emerging issues already in place, when it is necessary to run between floors.  In about an hour, I connected all the sensors with short wiring according to the scheme I had drawn up and tried out how it works.  It is important to ensure that there are no short circuits, since  I could not burn the head unit, but the braid from the wire came off in less than a second, when I accidentally shorted the battery.  And the wire itself is red-hot at the same time.  So it is necessary to observe the polarity and work carefully, so that later nothing of the kind will arise and this will not cause a fire. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/022/b79/4aa/022b794aa2e445e4026d7c46512a3e3e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <font>Rear block of the head unit with wires from the sensors</font> <br><br>  It was quite troublesome to set up the head unit, because  All commands for setting are transmitted either by SMS, or by using tone dialing on the phone‚Äôs keyboard.  This is a very big drawback of the whole structure - the inability to configure it via USB and the configurator program.  Accordingly, no profiles are also saved, and in the case of a long power outage, the system resets everything to the initial settings. <br><br>  <b>We leave to the place</b> <br>  Having collected everything in a large box, I went to the country.  The first thing I screwed all the sensors on the right places.  Then he armed himself with tongs and tape and began to connect the sensors to the wires.  I decided to put the head unit in an inconspicuous place on the second floor, respectively, I had to drill the overlap in order to pass the wire bundle from the first floor. <br><br>  The installation took me about two days, because, apart from the alarm, I bought four more spotlights and hung them on each side of the house, and connected the spotlights through a 12-220 V relay to the motion sensor on the street.  Now, if someone comes to the house, then the whole area is illuminated. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/551/bd3/c83/551bd3c839b36a93ed9c0a0272b54bb2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <font>Spotlights to illuminate the site on all walls of the house.</font> <br><br>  For greater sekurnosti, I powered the alarm bypassing the panel, for which I led to it one power wire directly.  In case of overload, I put a fuse plug in there, but it is impossible to turn off the power of the alarm system without de-energizing the dashboard. <br><br>  I adapted the second relay to switch on the electric heaters in the house.  With the help of an SMS command, I can turn on the heating in advance and come to an already somehow warmed up house.  The relay costs about 50 rubles.  I bought it at the Chip &amp; Dip store.  You should not forget to buy more flat connectors to the relay, since  otherwise it is impossible to connect wires to it. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f78/847/5b5/f788475b57d4ed7793ee1133128f1100.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <font>Relay to turn on the heat is not inside the box</font> <br><br>  Unfortunately, I was unable to connect a button for arming and disarming the alarm.  Most likely because it turned out to be defective.  Perhaps I will replace it later, but for now everything works and so. <br><br>  <b>Alarm operation</b> <br>  Fortunately, the "case" alarm did not work even once.  And I'm not eager to check what will happen if ... Sensors are programmed as follows: <br><ul><li>  When someone appears in the field of view of a street sensor, the light around the house lights up for three minutes.  SMS is not sent, because  sometimes neighbors come into the sensor‚Äôs field of view, and he starts to send news of this 10 times per hour. </li><li>  When any of the sensors is triggered, an SMS is sent to two numbers (mine and the wife) with an indication of which of the sensors has worked, and then the phone rings. </li><li>  Evening, at 22 o'clock, the alarm sends me a report that she is still at home and working properly. </li></ul><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/96e/c05/c19/96ec05c19853334d42b91c8e3e97b44c.png" alt="image"><br>  <font>Sample alarms</font> <br><ul><li>  In case of penetration into the house, I agreed with the chairman of our garden association, who constantly lives nearby, but now I plan to conclude an agreement with the PSC, which protects the local cottage village (3 kilometers in a straight line from our cottage), so that they come to the place.  It will cost 1500 rubles per month. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Instead of conclusion</b> <br>  In fact, there are a lot of directions to improve the alarm and the format of their work.  For example, here that I would improve: <br><ul><li>  The sellers website lacks the ability to independently select suitable components (sensors) and some clues for those who want to develop a scheme for installing an alarm system at home.  As a result, the employees of the store help the sensors to choose, and the configuration needs to be thought out on its own. </li><li>  In the head units, it is important to understand how many guard circuits they support and how you can configure the inputs in order to be able to select them according to such criteria.  I had 4 contours, but someone may need more. </li><li>  It is very disappointing that it is impossible to save a profile of a configured alarm system to a PC for subsequent reconfiguration and it wouldn‚Äôt hurt any web interface to work with the device at all. </li><li>  The head unit does not know how to support video cameras and send pictures from them, and buying a separate camera (there is one, for example, from Megaphone) is quite expensive. </li></ul><br>  In principle, progress does not stand still, and new models of head units appear constantly.  Perhaps now there are already better options than what I bought last year. <br><br>  I will be glad if my description will be useful for someone and I can answer questions that I forgot to cover in it. <br><br>  <b>Disclaimer</b> <br>  I didn‚Äôt give references and model names on purpose, but all this is easy to find on the Internet on my own. <br>  The house has not yet been finished outside and there are still some shortcomings inside, therefore you should not swear at it.  Then I will pack more and more carefully than now.  For now, the main thing is to work. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/129048/">https://habr.com/ru/post/129048/</a></p>
