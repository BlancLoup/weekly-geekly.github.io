  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Do I need to study at university?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Recently, similar discussions on near-resources are not uncommon.  Opinions of IT people more and more boil down to the fact that studying at a university is a common waste of time because they - [IT people without a diploma, dropped out of a university, bought a diploma] - underline it.  This view is understandable and has the right to exist.  But I want to talk about this issue from a different angle.  Of course, in each case, all individually, but some general conclusions can be drawn. <br><br>  He graduated from the university himself and defended his thesis (by the way, it was very closely related to the subject of work in an IT company), so it may appear that I will justify our educational system.  It is not so, but, in any case, I will try to be objective. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://sphotos-d.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-prn1/29342_553447978003200_654549278_n.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <i>While universities will think how to pay for utilities, there will not be a normal education in This Country.</i>

      I will not touch the stories about how the founders of Microsoft and Apple without higher education achieved world success.  This does not apply to the main topic.  <s>Many current politicians and businessmen also did not always study at the university.</s> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/918/fbf/2ed/918fbf2ed9f3872afdbceced8ddfc81c.jpeg"><br><br>  The first thing I want to draw attention to.  You will fly on an airplane, knowing that the main pilot did not study at the flight school, but you flew a thousand hours on a game simulator?  You will entrust the operation to a person who has not read the anatomy, but condemns, but is 100% sure that you need to cut it somewhere here?  Do you trust to defend yourself in court to a person who has not studied at the Academy of Law, but who has read 3 books on jurisprudence at home? <br><br>  Most likely no.  But, if you have a runny nose, then probably the advice of a pharmacist will be enough for you, and to understand the general principle of the simplified taxation system, you will need only the advice of an ‚Äúadvanced‚Äù non-representative or a lawyer trainee. <br><br>  <i>Very well the topic of the presence / necessity of the diploma is disclosed in the series "Force Majeure" (Suites).</i> <br><br>  If you draw an analogy with IT, then if you need to do a simple job, for example, write a press release, make a prototype in php or pull on a wordpress theme, then you do not need a professional specialist and, indeed, to master this or that IT craft, University de facto is not needed.  Fortunately for our IT specialists, 90% of all outsourcing work is just that. <br><br>  But as soon as the level of complexity of the task rises (and, accordingly, the level of responsibility), then everything is no longer as glamorous as it seems at first glance.  In addition to knowledge of the platform, language, tool, you must also understand the domain area and have a historical background of knowledge that a person will be ready to apply in critical situations.  In the case of lawyers, this is an acquaintance with a base of past cases and the ability to find precedents, for a manager, this is knowledge of business cases and fail stories, for a developer, knowledge of mathematics, algorithms, etc. <br><br>  Open any job, for example, from health care.  It is unlikely that you will see many vacancies, where there will be no requirement to be a bachelor or master.  Or ask anyone who has been interviewed by high-tech companies - they are unlikely to be asked questions on C # or Java. <br><br>  In fact, the answer to the question ‚Äúis it worth to go to university?‚Äù Everyone can answer quite simply.  To do this, the question should be slightly reformulated as follows: <br><br><ul><li>  did you go to college because you wanted to go there or because you didn‚Äôt take it anywhere else? </li><li>  did you go to college because it is necessary for a career? </li><li>  did you go to college for a diploma? </li><li>  Are you planning your career for the next 5 years or 20? </li></ul><br>  But this is not the main idea that I would like to convey. <br><br>  The main value of any country is its intellectual potential <s>(well, oil and gas)</s> .  It is measured in the quantity and quality of patents (remember all patent wars?), The availability of advanced technologies and research workers.  Every big IT company spends millions of dollars on research and experimentation.  Because of this, they are protected for ten to twenty years ahead of default and serious problems. <br><br>  Our situation is a bit different.  Research institutes have practically lost their strategic importance, the university still teaches, mostly those who have not been employed.  Bureaucracy suppresses any initiatives and successes in the bud.  Therefore, speaking from the point of view of geopolitics, the presence of XXX thousand outsourcers for the country is a rather useless indicator.  In many millions of countries we have a scanty number of offices of world companies with R &amp; D.  CIS in terms of penetration of large companies, I think, loses to Tel Aviv alone.  But in Israel, the 27-year-old junior developer is the norm. <br><br>  Well, in conclusion, I will say that many of my colleagues quite successfully combined both university studies and work in IT companies.  Moreover, the ability to plan their time and the ability to set priorities very much now help them. <br><br>  In addition, the university is a great time to experiment and search for what you are <i>really</i> interested in.  Often, people who decide to study everything on their own take, as a rule, ‚Äúwhat is easier,‚Äù ‚Äúwhat a friend advised‚Äù or ‚Äúwhere they took‚Äù, and after a few years they are not ready to give up their favorite work, because  need to learn all over again. <br><br>  By the way, when people ask me what to learn and what programming language to use, I answer this way: take your hobby and make for it, for example, a website - first in C #, then in Java and compare your feelings, which you liked more.  If neither one nor the other - look further.  After several experiments, you will realize that you really get and like. <br><br>  Thanks for attention! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160871/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160871/</a></p>
