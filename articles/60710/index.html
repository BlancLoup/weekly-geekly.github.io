  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Yesterday was on a teleconference with Google I / O</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  What am I talking about? </h5><br>  Last week I received an invitation to visit Google‚Äôs office and watch a live broadcast of the Google I / O discovery.  Alexey, more thanks for the invitation, I really liked it. <br><br>  Always wanted to look at Google from the inside.  I was pleasantly surprised by the lack of a corporate uniform, which our ‚Äúleading IT companies‚Äù love very much and by the fact that the office looks more like a kindergarten than a serious office that writes monstrously complex software.  According to the employees (they managed to communicate with the guys who work on Google), the company lacks the concept of ‚Äúworkplaces‚Äù <i>(these are not those who throw, but those who put)</i> , it‚Äôs important that a person manages to do what he has to, and no one cares that the person came in 2 and went to 5. He copes with the tasks.  So the theory of animal husbandry <i>(admission by passes, the minute of delay is fine, you need to sit 9 hours and not a minute less)</i> once again defeated and defeated.  This is my personal perception, now to the point. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Introduction to </h5><br>  The conference was opened by Eric Schmidt.  The meaning of his words, I realized this: people zadolbala complexity.  The programmer must program, and not jump and run through the configs like a crazy gopher.  For example, in order to set up a Java project with Struts and JPA, you need to spend a day, or even two and three (it all depends on what application server, how angry and cruel it is), and I won‚Äôt even say how long Will occupy smoking fakov and manov on subject.  On a personal example: CRUD application on Python (I saw it for the first time) with Django (also opening) and GAE framework (another new thing) I wrote in 12 hours and deployed it on a server.  With RoR, it lasted a little longer ‚Äî about 20 hours (I entered convention over configuration for a long time, yet Java leaves an indelible imprint on my brain).  No configs and other files, I take the right tool for me and use it.  A programmer differs from a coder in that the programmer does not write in a language or platform, he takes the desired language and platform and solves the problem.  For each task, he is able to pick the most convenient tool. <br>  GAE is moving in that direction.  As I understand it, since yesterday the Java SDK came out of closed testing, the plans include support for all languages ‚Äã‚Äãthat are played by ‚ÄúJVM‚Äù.

    <h5>  Js what's new </h5><br>  After Eric the microphone fell into the hands of Vika Kundotra. <br>  Kundotra, of course, sang the praises of the company's engineering courage, as an example, Zhmeyl cited.  According to him, since April 2004 (the date of issue of the default mailer), AJAX went to the masses.  And all thanks to Google.  Frankly, you can not argue.  The mailer is good, but in those times - the best. <br>  Vick talked a lot about the virtues of HTML5.  By the way, if someone was at a lecture on ‚Äúopen-web prospects‚Äù, held at the last GDD in Moscow, they would say and show about the same thing - video in a browser, drawing and animation canvases, etc.  There was no breakaway from the head. <br>  But I experienced a real shock from the Beach demo - in the browser (!!!) the scene of flying around a tropical island rendered with decent quality turns.  I do not rummage in 3D, but the 3D scene on Javascript (!!!) is cool, even to a teapot like me, this is obvious.  Honestly, it seems to me that this 3D hocus-pocus is dead, like Grandpa Lenin.  Sane people do not need a 3D island in the browser, moreover, an adequate person will not make an animation or a 3D scene on Java Script - the wrong language.  Javascript is good for editing HTML, but no more.  Why think so?  For the dissector in which a number of animation tasks will be solved, I chose JavaFX, a language that aims to work with animation and UI.  You can also write a web application in assembly language.  But why, if there is RoR or php at the worst.  Still, I hope that Java Island is rather an exception and a demonstration of the capabilities of modern JS engines, and not a guide to action - ‚Äúwrite 3D websites on JS'e‚Äù.  If it was a hint of a 3D game, then I have big, very serious doubts that Google managed to prepare powerful analogs of modern game-dreaming tools.  This is unreal.  In addition, game offices are quite conservative, they will not switch to 3D browsers just like that, moreover, it will take years before the pros in a new area mature. <br><br>  By the way, web workers appeared, i.e.  multithreading is available in the browser <i>(I understand correctly?)</i> , long live packs of curves web applications with deadlocks!  They showed an interesting demonstration - a video is played in the browser (through the video tag) on ‚Äã‚Äãwhich the girl walks: first, go there, and then here.  The JS stream tracks the movements of the young lady and draws some diagram next to the video, on the canvas.  It seems so it was, if I am mistaken, correct, please. <br><br><h5>  About browsers and html_css_js OSes </h5><br>  Unfortunately, I was distracted at the moment when they were joking at IE <i>(this is a browser like this)</i> .  If anyone heard, write, I want to laugh too. <br>  The presence of the head of Mozilla was not surprised at all <i>(of course, the money must be worked out)</i> .  On the one hand, I really don‚Äôt like IE, we have a customer who has ONLY IE 6 installed, sometimes my colleagues and I have to hold group psychotherapy sessions in the process of cutting out the next crutch under this wonderful browser <i>(I‚Äôm exaggerating, but in general it‚Äôs so and there really is)</i> . <br>  There are certain concerns about the friendship of Google and Mozilla.  Still, the days of IE are numbered, I am sure that in two years the share of the Microsoft browser will fall to 30-40 percent (less and less), unless, of course, a miracle happens.  Still, MS profuked his happiness, the monopoly freebie was over.  There is another danger - the tandem Google / Chrome and Mozilla.  So far, what they are doing is just wonderful.  And what will happen next?  Will the web steer Google for a couple with Mozilla, which is sponsored by him?  And, as you know, who treats a girl, he dances her. <br><br>  I liked the director's message (sort of?) Palm, the axis wrapper (Palm Web OS) of which is written in JS + CSS + HTML.  Those.  When writing an application for Palm, you don‚Äôt have to go into a strange language, the usual tools stick out.  Enough original solution. <br><br><h5>  GAE, Android </h5><br>  I don‚Äôt have Androyd, and while he doesn‚Äôt appear in our country at a normal price, I‚Äôm unlikely to be interested in him.  By the way, on Habr√© has already written - the second Androyd developer contest began <br><br>  The audience was shown a good example, which I like myself: the whole web application is in one language - on Java.  It's about GWT + GAE_Java.  At one time, I specially studied GWT, delaying my acquaintance with JS to the very end <i>(I don‚Äôt like him)</i> .  In fact, the GWT application on GAE is a vacuum cleaner.  As a result of high responsiveness (you can quickly click without waiting for the page to reload and render the page), users quickly click out the free limit, and then the counter will turn on, which will significantly hit the price (I‚Äôm not talking about applications with three visits per day).  If I am not mistaken, the article with the calculation of the cost of the chat on the basis of GAE ran through the Habr√©, the free limit with an average load was enough for several hours. <br>  Nevertheless, in some cases, the approach is ideologically correct - in fact, you write a two-tier application, with a client face and server background.  For an application with a really complex Gui, the solution is perfect (I wrote a toy on GWT in one office). <br><br><h5>  Dry residue </h5><br>  In general - cool.  I do it all for everyone to read the specs and follow them, both browser developers and web developers, I like GAE, I adore GWT (by the way, they talk about the second version of this great tool).  I like the fact that there is an Androyd, an iPhone Axis, a Windus Mobile, they need to compete with each other for our wallets.  If Palma reincarnates, I, as a user, will win again. <br>  I absolutely do not like the fact that Mozilla lives on Google‚Äôs money and speaks at the opening of his conferences.  I have a fear that nothing good will end.  I do not believe in the appearance of the second affectionate dictator (or what do they call Guido?) In the face of Google.  Yes, the company makes good software, produces a lot of commercially justified products, while significantly advancing the web progress.  But any strong company tend to bend others around you.  The question is when the deflections will become obvious (I believe that the Mozilla deflection is counted). <br><br>  <i>Well, the traditional is all my IMHO, you can view the event as you like.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/60710/">https://habr.com/ru/post/60710/</a></p>
