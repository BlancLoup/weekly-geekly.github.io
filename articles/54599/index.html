  <section class="page js-page"><h1>We are crazy about lomography.</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h1>  I'll start with the story. </h1><br><br>  Lomography began with the St. Petersburg, and at that time the Leningrad plant "LOMO".  The name thus stands for ‚ÄúLeningrad Optical-Mechanical Association‚Äù.  In 1984, the Leningrad Optical-Mechanical Association ‚ÄúLOMO‚Äù launched the first domestic compact automatic camera ‚ÄúLOMO COMPACT-AUTOMAT‚Äù (LK-A) into mass production. <img title="373752530_ba935ef90a" src="http://infport.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/373752530_ba935ef90a-300x225.jpg" alt="373752530_ba935ef90a" width="300" height="225"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The camera was carefully copied by Soviet military experts from the Japanese camera ‚ÄúCOSINA CX-2‚Äù, which was donated to the Deputy Minister of the USSR Ministry of Defense Industry, Peter Ivanovich Kornitsky, at the international exhibition of film and photo equipment in Cologne.  The stunning similarity of the Japanese and Soviet cameras was explained by the fact that the Deputy Minister of Defense Industry demanded that our camera be ‚Äúlike the Japanese‚Äù both outside and inside.  The Japanese camera at LOMO was unscrewed, copied all 450 parts, but the defense industry specialists who produced homing heads for missiles (GOS 9E410), periscopes for submarines, and the laser sights of the ship‚Äôs fire control systems could not copy the Japanese electronic shutter due to the lack of appropriate technology. Because of what the design of the domestic analogue of the Japanese camera had to be greatly simplified.  So that the Soviet camera did not yield to the Western prototype, LK-A was equipped with wide-angle optics and an innovative automatic exposure system, available at that time only in expensive professional cameras, which made it possible to photograph in all lighting conditions.  Photos taken by ‚ÄúLK-A‚Äù have a greater depth of field, bright saturated colors and characteristic darkened edges of images.  This is how the first lomography tool appeared.  But he was regarded as an ordinary camera, not carrying in his guise anything attractive and attractive. <habracut><br><h1>  About the birth of culture. </h1><br><img title="3003040567_9012917839" src="http://infport.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/3003040567_9012917839-225x300.jpg" alt="3003040567_9012917839" width="225" height="300"><br><br>  In spring 1991, students of the Vienna School of Art Matthias Figl and Wolfgang Stranzinger bought very cheap Soviet cameras LK-A at a thrift shop for $ 12 apiece.  Enjoying the taste of ‚ÄúBudweiser‚Äù beer, students on a cheap expired film were filming everything they came across without thinking about building frames and not looking at the viewfinder.

      In Vienna, the Austrians put together a colorful photo-photo from hundreds of photos and were delighted with the purchase: the colors in the photos were bright and intense, the pictures emitted some mental waves of heat.  Due to significant color and geometric distortions of the lens, the camera had a specific view of the world, and the lack of deliberate construction of the frame documented ‚Äúlife as it is‚Äù - this view students began to call ‚Äúlomography‚Äù. <br><h1>  Spread. </h1><br>  Upon returning to the Vienna School of Art, students quickly put on a lomography of their friends and their friends, teachers and their families.  They started organizing photo exhibitions and registered a cultural union - the Lomographic Society (DIE LOMOGRAPHISCHE GESSELSCHAFT) with headquarters in Vienna.  Matthias and Wolfgang became his scrap presidents.  The first exhibition was a great success.  For the next two years, Lomopresidents personally bought cameras cheaply wholesale and retail in all Eastern European countries and sold them to their followers for $ 100 apiece.  In the meantime, the lomographer society expanded, with the new exhibitions the movement was becoming more and more famous. <br>  By 1994, all LK-A cameras were purchased by the Lomographic Society and the mainstream motion cameras sent a fax to LOMO OJSC.  The fax said that in Austria alone more than 300 people are in love with a miniature Soviet camera ‚ÄúLK-A‚Äù and would like to organize a photo exhibition in Moscow.  But at the LOMO plant the fax was taken for a joke and went to the trash can.  The first meeting of the community and directors of the LOMO plant took place in December of the same year.  The Austrian Parliament and V. Putin took part in the preparation for the organization of the meeting.  The final point of the meeting was the conclusion of an agreement on the exclusive supply of ‚ÄúLC-A‚Äù to the Lomographic community.  And it, in turn, becomes the exclusive distributor of LomoCompacts around the world. <br><h1>  ‚ÄúLOMO - LOve &amp; M√≥tion‚Äù The modern arsenal of LOMO graphista. </h1><br><img title="120161374154" src="http://infport.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/120161374154-300x215.jpg" alt="120161374154" width="300" height="215">  1. <strong>LOMO-Compact Automat (LCA, LCA)</strong> is the first Soviet pocket-sized camera equipped with a wide-range automatic electronic shutter controlled by an electronic exposure meter.  The camera is robust, lightweight and compact, and easy to use.  Specifications: <br><ul><li>  Film width - 35 mm </li><li>  Frame size - 24 √ó 36 mm </li><li>  Number of frames - up to 36 </li><li>  Focal length - 32 mm </li><li>  Relative hole - 1: 2,8 </li><li>  Field of view - 63 degrees </li><li>  Focusing limits - from 0.8 m to infinity </li><li>  Diaphragm range - from 2.8 to 16 </li><li>  Shutter speeds - from 1/500 s to 2 s </li><li>  Viewfinder - telescopic </li><li>  Flash Lamp Sync System - Type X </li><li>  Tripod socket thread - ¬º " </li><li>  Overall dimensions - 107 √ó 68 √ó 43.5 mm * Mass - 0.25 kg </li><li>  Photography modes - automatic and with setting parameters on the distance scale (0.8 m; 1.5 m; 3 m; infinity) </li><li>  The sensitivity range of the films is from 16 to 250 (from ASA 100 to ASA 1600 for LCA +) </li></ul><br>  The most important advantages of this model is the electronic exposure meter, the use of 35 mm film, hot Boschmak for external flash. <br>  In Moscow, in the ‚ÄúRepublic‚Äù stores the device costs about 11,000 rubles. <br>  You can also get modern Lomography machines such as Holga and Diana <br><br><img title="121869502664" src="http://infport.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/121869502664.jpg" alt="121869502664" width="258" height="247">  2. <strong>Holga</strong> - a native of Hong Kong, conquered a large number of hearts around the world.  A plastic lens, an angular body, a medium format film are not disadvantages, in its case these are advantages that help you to plunge into the deepest layers of Lomography. <br>  Among its advantages are also a built-in flash, shutter speeds, aperture selection, distance selection, multi-exposure.  It is possible to choose the color of the flash by switching the color filters that are right inside the lamp.  The only serious problem to find is the 120th film. <br><br><img title="12091200879" src="http://infport.ru/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/12091200879-300x282.jpg" alt="12091200879" width="300" height="282">  3. <strong>Diana</strong> - the predecessor of Holga.  Despite this, there is a huge selection of additional accessories in her arsenal, such as external flashes, additional lenses, and waterproof covers.  The camera itself has such amenities as shutter speeds, aperture selection, distance selection, multiple exposure, pinhole, connector for an additional flash. <br><br>  The lomographic community lists to this list a good bunch of devices, the list includes 2 objective devices, and 9 objective, various Fisheye devices.  But you can look at them on the <a href="http://shop.lomography.ru/catalog/catalog/lomocamers/">site of the Lomographic community.</a> <br><br>  The most interesting and attractive in Lomography is that the result obtained on the card is not known in advance.  And the frame for which it was tuned for several hours will be completely not interesting, and the frame photographed by chance, when I put the camera in my pocket, snatches a stunning plot, with beautiful shadows and stunning vignetting. <br><br>  Based on materials from <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/">www.wikipedia.org</a> , <a href="http://lomography.ru/">Lomographic Embassy in Russia</a> , <a href="http://infport.ru/">InfPort</a> </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/54599/">https://habr.com/ru/post/54599/</a></p>
