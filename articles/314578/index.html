It is not clear how sincere and for how long, but this is a qualitative leap.  First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.  Now it has even gone further - then they join you. <br>  In the subject area, containers have become habitual, the whole ‚Äúmovement‚Äù has gone from the kernels to applications (yes, to Docker and its ecosystem). <br><br></li><li>  The orchestration projects will gain strength, or it will become possible to use. <br>  Extinguishing what we call OS-containers, that is, isolation by the kernel will remain only for launching applications, distributions will run in VMs. <br><br></li><li>  Heh ... This is open-source, there are too many things.  In principle, there are two big good conferences - Linux Plumbers for engineers and ContainerCon for non-them. <br>  Good communities will not be recommended, they are usually formed around projects, and their goodness each determines for itself. <br><br></li><li>  Docker for Mac &amp; for AWS.  It was very cool, but the public has not yet felt all the coolness (well, technologically, of course, there is where to go). </li><li>  Standard development.  Make, git, gdb, strace.  For development, and because it is convenient and sufficient for my needs. <br><br></li><li>  On a working Debian, for it works, on a home Ubuntu, because  using CLI in everyday tasks is not very convenient. </li></ol><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d2c/165/d6d/d2c165d6d21f3e5e3ec8bf6a67e6b819.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><h3>  Stephen hemminger </h3><br>  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/"><b>Microsoft</b></a> / Principal Software Architect / USA.

The focus has been shifted from making virtualization works (now it does), to making containers work (still work in progress). <br><br></li><li>  All commercial applications will be on the cloud.  Things that are now done.  Problems will still exist but be harder. <br><br></li><li>  Many things become less technical (and more marketing) as things mature.  I would recommend are netdev and DPDK.  Both have active contributor groups and semi-annual conferences. <br><br></li><li>  The BBR and Codel innovations (from Google) were both surprisingly and well though out. <br><br></li><li>  Too much manual building and integration with git etc.  Should you really like it? <br><br></li><li>  I have two laptops.  One corporate running Windows (with Linux VM) and one personal running Linux (with Windows VM).

Indeed, while the world is moving toward VR and advanced input devices, developers still use teletype imitation.  This is a big omission, and I hope to see a day when we all will be using truly user-friendly interfaces.  And I hope to participate as much as possible. <br><br></li><li>  I love where the Linux kernel goes in terms of development.  In recent years, many interesting subsystems have appeared, performance analysis tools have improved, DPDK, NVMf, etc. have appeared. <br>  And, of course, there is significant progress in the field of containers and packaging applications. <br>  From programming languages, a real surprise is Rust. <br><br></li><li>  I think in the next few years we will have a cardinal rethinking of the traditional CLI tools used by developers and admins.  It will become much more powerful and intuitive.  As an example, sysdig, ripgrep and gitless. <br><br></li><li>  Unfortunately, online media is such an echo chamber.  The same ideas are repeated many times.  It does not help you to do something special.  I encourage everyone to read less of popular sources, and write more to your github. <br><br></li><li>  In terms of hardware solutions in recent years, I especially remember YubiKey Nano.  This is a two-factor authorization solution, really made for people.  And because of the design features (USB keyboard emulation), it works on all operating systems. <br><br></li><li>  In addition to text editors, I use Emacs very actively.  I use it as a tiled WM, or, if you like, as a replacement for tmux on steroids.  Sometimes I use Jupyter for interactive work with data. <br><br></li><li>  I have one computer for all needs - MacBook Pro.  It has OS X. I do all my Linux-related tasks in Docker under the Alpine distribution.  He has a good package manager, and the base system takes only a few megabytes.  Over the next few months, I will try NixOS as a potential replacement for Alpine. </li></ol><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/646/20d/ba6/64620dba6bf2ac7e29a115167f7b9c9d.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><h3>  Michael turquette </h3><br>  <b><a href="http://baylibre.com/">BayLibre</a></b> / President and CEO / USA.

Recently, again pulled into the wireless network, and there is something to exert their forces. <br><br></li><li>  Of the most significant changes, perhaps, this is a manifestation of the open implementation of 802.11s and the inclusion of the new version of Batman-adv in upstream.  The rest is the implementation of 802.11 substandards and the development of wireless module drivers. <br><br></li><li>  I think, the drivers for the new 802.11ad standard modules will be included in the core and will make full support for airtime fairness at the level of mac80211.  Also, we are waiting for the time when the handover from the operator's lte / 5G network to wifi becomes the usual norm. <br><br></li><li>  It is difficult to recommend the conference, it may offend those whom I did not recommend.  I can say that it is worth paying attention to all the conferences in your professional field, and if there are local ones, then try to attend them.  Of those that I would recommend to pay attention in the first place - this is Openwrt Summit, Make-Wifi-Fast and BattleMesh with a mandatory subscription to the newsletter.  So you can get the latest information. <br><br></li><li>  I especially remember the manifestation in the market of powerful small modules for IoT.  These are ESP8266, RTL8710, full-fledged Linkit One, Omega2.

Also to me interesting virtualization: server and container. <br><br></li><li>  Obviously, many hardware manufacturers and software developers have paid close attention to solutions such as Ceph, Open vStorage, Gluster.  Almost all vendors have, at a minimum, reference architectures, and many make a significant contribution to development.  In parallel, several dozens of new solutions are being created. <br>  Software begins to emerge, using new approaches to manage horizontally scalable infrastructures. <br>  NVMe protocol adapts very quickly.  I don‚Äôt remember such speed and interest.  For example, the first prototypes of NVMe over RDMA were publicly shown for the year and the appearance of the standard. <br>  With the advent of fast devices and storage, we see that the recipe ‚Äúcore is a bottleneck, exclude it from the Data Path‚Äù is increasingly used in the development of performance-sensitive application storage. <br><br></li><li>  I look forward to moving forward in the field of adaptation Storage Class Memory (new types of memory that will stand in the hierarchy between RAM and NAND Flash) <br><br></li><li>  Probably the most useful for me in the last six months have been blogs and forums, posted in the social sections of <a href="http://intel.com/">intel.com</a> and <a href="http://mellanox.com/">mellanox.com</a> .  Of course, not to mention <a href="http://lwn.net/">LWN.net</a> .  Russian-speaking sources: Shuklina's blogs (amarao), a good technical blog from the True System company, I like the Trinity company forum, several blogs of companies on Habr√©. <br>  If we talk about conferences, from foreign I can highlight: <br><ul><li>  Open Fabric Alliance Workshop <br></li><li>  Luster User Group Conference <br></li><li>  Msst <br></li><li>  SNIA SDC <br></li></ul><br>  Events hosted by The Linux Foundation.  In Russia, we can talk about <b><a href="http://linuxpiter.ru/">Linux Piter</a></b> , some events organized by Yandex, we (RAIDIX) have been holding the ProStor technology forum for the second year.  Excellent conference <b><a href="http://www.highload.ru/">Highload ++</a></b> .  Something interesting can be found at <a href="http://www.secr.ru/">CEE SECR</a> , the last time I was disappointed with the quality of most reports.  In Russia, HGST has an excellent team, and the guys spend interesting ‚ÄúTechnical breakfasts‚Äù. <br><br></li><li>  I like to ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù the maximum out of iron, so now NVMe drives from HGST and 100Gb coherently adapters from Mellanox come to mind.  The constant feeling that you can increase your productivity is not letting go yet, and I am sure that after my presentation on Linux Piter I will not stop and will continue to develop my stand. <br>  Waiting for 3D Xpoint from Intel and ReRAM from WDC. <br><br></li><li>  Various tools for monitoring system performance, profiling and tracing.  This is due to the fact that one of my tasks is to study new technologies, understanding what is happening in the system. <br>  If we talk about the last few months, the most popular tools for me were: <br>  1) Benchmarks (fio and specialized benchmarks for testing the performance of parallel FS); <br>  2) Utilities for testing performance and diagnosing networks (More often Infiniband-networks); <br>  3) Utilities from the sysstat package; <br>  4) perf, top, nmon; <br>  5) sg3_utils, nvmecli and utilities from manufacturers of flash-devices. <br><br></li><li>  On the PC, I use MacOS :).  On servers, we mostly have RedHat-like distributions.  This is due to the fact that a lot of software used in large companies is written under RHEL, and not all of it is open source. <br></li></ol><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ea5/253/d88/ea5253d884c2233a8dd56dacd3d936ad.jpg" alt="image" align="left"><h3>  Alexey Brodkin </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.synopsys.com/home.aspx">Synopsys</a> / Senior Software Engineer / Russia.
