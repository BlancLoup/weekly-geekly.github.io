"</a> <br><br>  I do not want to chew on what has already been said, let's try to sort out several ‚Äúproblems‚Äù to use this model. <br>  All examples are based on a completely real my personal experience, not "the movement of a spherical horse in a vacuum."  But at the same time, all noncritical details in the examples have been strongly modified, so that ‚Äúany coincidence with real characters is random.‚Äù <br><br>  Especially for readability, all descriptions of the situation go first, and then the decisions that are logical in my opinion - so that you can first think about the options yourself.  And, as always, I will be happy to discuss your solutions or opinions on the proposed actions.  This is not mathematics, and the only correct answer is not here.

      Situation 1. Perfectionist.  One of the partners invited to help with the project of implementing a balanced scorecard in a state-owned company.  When analyzing the project, it turned out that at the moment the project is written TK (very voluminous), part of the development has been done.  But!  the entire project budget has already been ‚Äúeaten‚Äù at the stage of writing the TOR.  And to complete the project in time, you need two more months of work and the involvement of additional external specialists on an hourly rate.  The project manager on the part of the contractor wrote TZ himself; could not offer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Situation 2. Article.  One of the student interns was assigned to write an article on the company's website.  A topic was issued, tasks were set.  Held educational program.  He promised to do it in a day, he disappeared for four working days.  The brought article turned out to be of very high quality, which caused some suspicions - several lines from it were plugged into Yandex and the original was found.  At the meeting, the employee admitted that yes - he stole someone else's article from the network and tried to pass it off as his own. <br><br>  Situation 3. Conflict of interest.  While working at the training center, I was faced with the task of hiring staff in the service support department.  In parallel, my colleague (with whom we had a common leader) was looking for a coach for himself.  Recruitment was a priority, with high requirements and tight deadlines.  I managed to find a good candidate, he had to have an interview on the procedure and my manager personally.  After the interview, the manager approached me and said, ‚ÄúYes, the candidate is perfect for a service engineer, but we have strained with the coaches - so I advised him to go to the head of the training department, they met and this candidate will be our coach.  And you keep looking. ‚Äù  There was no answer to my legitimate "What ...? !!!" <br><br>  Situation 4. Restrictions on career growth.  The head of one of the partners told about an excellent specialist who had outgrown the position in his department, but because of the nature of the business, he could not offer anything more interesting.  He has already done all the additional tasks, helped the supervisor, etc.  The question was - how to keep such a specialist? <br><br>  My options are: <br><br>  Situation 1. Perfectionist.  Judging by the banal misunderstanding of their tasks, processing in some areas and complete failure in others, unreasonable megalomania - we have a ‚Äúnovice enthusiast‚Äù.  Moreover, to which, at the very beginning of his work, there were no clear quantitative goals and an uncontrollable confidence in the most important stage of work.  The situation is neglected and rarely gets out of it without loss for all parties involved.  Speaking easier - to meet, discuss, try to explain everything to the person in as much detail as possible and lower the salary (set a fine).  What is most important is to work very clearly on this issue with its leader, since there is clearly a lack of control over the task and goal setting by the management.  Measures should have been taken a long time ago. <br><br>  Situation 2. Article.  Again, the ‚Äúnovice enthusiast,‚Äù and closer to the ‚Äúrealist learning,‚Äù since he already realized that he would not write well himself.  Formally, it is necessary to teach, in practice, my opinion is to expel.  Since the company if the fraud had not been opened could incur significant reputational risks.  And we will not be able to completely trust such a person in the future.  And if there is no trust in the company, it is very difficult to work. <br><br>  Situation 3. Conflict of interest.  Your manager is most likely a ‚Äúnovice enthusiast‚Äù in this role.  Perhaps he did not manage other managers before and still, out of habit, he steers ‚Äúover the head‚Äù by staff directly.  Solution - I do not know a good one.  The bad, but the best possible is to get a ‚Äúparade set of canines‚Äù, calmly and convincingly defend your position, trying to get at least some compensation for having the result of your hired job taken away from you.  Yes, there will be a worse relationship.  The solution is not perfect.  But if you silently agree - such and similar situations will be repeated many times. <br><br>  Situation 4. Restrictions on career growth.  Do not keep employees who are already bored as ‚Äúgurus‚Äù if you cannot offer them more interesting and better paid jobs.  But they should not be lost either.  Discuss with the employee his possible transition to a more significant position in another department of your company, to a key client, vendor, etc.  That is, the position at which you will regularly encounter with him in business and if you help him with preparing for a new position, transition, etc.  That good relationship with this person for many years will be much more useful than a few months of torment on which you can doom you both with clever tricks forcing him to stay. <br><br>  I will be glad to hear your opinion, not a single comment will remain unreviewed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/96084/">https://habr.com/ru/post/96084/</a></p>
