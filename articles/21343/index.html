      Let's start, perhaps, from March 14, because it was then that a meeting of Yahoo‚Äôs board of directors and the election of a new board of directors would take place, which would help Bill Gates.  Lawyers are good people, especially if they are on your side - chess elephants for themselves are, in fact, small pieces, and it‚Äôs not difficult to make a mat with two pieces.  So it was here - we rummaged in the legislative acts and found that, according to the laws of the state of Delaware, annual meetings in mandatory-compulsory procedure should be held at least once every 13 months.  If we consider that the last meeting was held in the middle of June 2007, then Yahoo has about 4 months for internal reorganization in such a way that shareholders are satisfied.  So it was decided to postpone the election of a new board of directors for an indefinite (although, as we have already found out, the time limit exists) time. <br><br>  Yahoo‚Äôs second defensive gesture resulted in partial cooperation with another large corporation.  Google couldn‚Äôt choose, although Seryozha Brin would not mind, since they too had similar interests and methods of earning, they wanted to run away from Microsoft.  Remains "forever second player" of the Western market - AOL (owned by Time Warner).  So began the negotiations with Y. <br><br>  According to the Wall Street Journal, the company of Mr. Young offers TW the entry of the AOL portal under Yahoo's wing in exchange for a certain number of shares (for mere mortals, this is still classified information) and the place of one of the TW representatives on the board of directors.  Such a friendship for AOL a chance not to stay in the midst of large Internet sharks, although the opening of the AIM system (which AOL is currently planning) would bring good money to the portal.  For Yahoo, the gains in the workforce received ‚Äî the portal is growing, and you do not need to pay wages, all from the same Time Warner wallet.  Total, according to analysts, the net savings of 1 billion evergreen annually. <br><br>  Regarding the last-mentioned collaboration with News Corp.  Comrade Murdoch, then everything is somewhat more complicated - you have to work hard to integrate MySpace, WSJ and The Times into the Yahoo portals.  Why do you need such perturbations and what does Jerry Yang want?  This kind of merger will greatly increase the market value of Yahoo.  If we consider that Microsoft would have to borrow money for the purchase of Y, then ... That money is simply not enough, it will break. <br><br>  It is also rumored that Rupert Murdoch‚Äôs simply partial purchase of a block of shares (20-25%), without much integration of services.  In this case, there is a method of diluting existing assets, which is why the share of negatively-minded shareholders (I would like to say "old fart", but were dissatisfied last time) will decrease, which will not allow them to be promoted to the Board of Directors. <br><br>  I would like to believe that Yahoo will be friends with News Corp., because for Russian users (let's defend our interests), cooperation with AOL has not fallen short.  The essence of the problem is in assessing the potential of MySpace - News Corp's analysts say it is 10 billion, Yahoo analysts believe that the largest social network costs no more than 5 billion. <br><br>  In any case, Yahoo has time, and this, as you know, is the most valuable currency. <br><br>  PS Sorry that this time without links and references, stuck in the elevator, there is nothing to do, the lifters are already messing downstairs, and the Internet, praise mobile technology, is working. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/21343/">https://habr.com/ru/post/21343/</a></p>
