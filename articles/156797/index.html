Only the discoveries of Semmelweis and Lister forced the doctors to wash their hands, which reduced the mortality rate dozens of times.  A good example of the maturation of technology, is not it? <br><br>  / <img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/def/572/4da/def5724da4e451f008c544b965bc4ec1.jpg"><br><br>  C SEO all about the same.  Everyone read the wrathful post of Ludwig Bystronovsky and dozens of his ilk, saw jokes like ‚Äúhow many SEOs need to plug in a light bulb to download cheaply without registration and SMS‚Äù.  Yes, immature SEO can be encountered now.  But there is also a disgusting design, inoperative code, moronic advertising.  Does this mean that design is always bad, software is buggy, and advertising is the raw material for the IDI?  Hardly.  By 2012, the most advanced SEO technologies have proven their effectiveness and continue to evolve to forms that are absolutely legitimate from the point of view of search engines.

      <i>In the first article of our blog on Habrahabr, we want to prove that modern SEO does not spoil websites, does not spam, does not increase the amount of black ice hopelessness in the Universe, but on the contrary, it gives site owners the opportunity to attract targeted visitors neatly and without any side effects.</i> <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  Read more <habracut><br><br><h5>  Who are you? </h5><br><br>  SeoPult is one of the leaders of the Russian market of search engine promotion sites.  Among companies of comparable size can be called except that the exchange Sape.  The automated promotion system originated in UnMedia as an internal working tool for optimizers, but quickly developed into a service that was so convenient and efficient that UnMedia executives decided to share it.  In 2008-2009, it blew up the market, since then SeoPult has not ceased to develop and in fact has already been completely rewritten several times - including from the point of view of algorithms.  Our service is used both by professionals (advertising agencies, web studios) that embed it in their business, and by the site owners themselves (from online stores with millions of dollars in turn to personal microsites). <br><br><ul><li>  We have <a href="http://seopult.tv/">Internet TV SeoPult.TV</a> - there you can always watch interviews with top managers of Ozon, Game Insight, Euroset, eBay, hundreds of major marketing specialists, all sorts of useful workshops and so on. </li><li>  There is <a href="http://www.cybermarketing.ru/">a CyberMarketing training center</a> , where every week hundreds of beginning advertisers and small businessmen get rid of ignorance. </li><li>  Our R &amp; D department employs analysts and mathematicians rotated on search engine algorithms.  Therefore, SeoPult works with a reference mass more effectively than a living specialist - the system relies on empirically tested models, and not on intuition. </li><li>  Now SeoPult promotes about 230,000 sites, 79% of keywords are present in the TOP10.  These are 200,000 businesses (and much more living people) for which the flow of customers and orders from the natural search engine output is vital.  Many of these businesses will not be able to survive if SEO suddenly disappears from the face of the planet. </li><li>  Recently, SeoPult, in exchange for a minority stake, received an investment of $ 10 million from iTech Capital, which is not our evaluative statement about ourselves, but the result of a third-party and very deep external examination of reliability and availability. </li></ul><br><h5>  Why normal SEO does not spoil sites </h5><br>  Search engines began with a trivial search for matches between user requests and content in the index pages, then they added - and this was a Google revolution!  - the reference graph of credibility, then ... And then it turned out that this is more than an effective and balanced system.  It only needs protection from exploitation through weak points and fine-tuning.  Now, quite sophisticated methods are used to protect users from tricks and setting up relevance coefficients ‚Äî right up to machine learning (and this is a form of weak artificial intelligence), but in general, web search continues to determine the relevance of requests to specific pages based on matches in content and link mass.  What does all of this mean? <br><br><h6>  Stage I (the distant past) </h6><br>  In the early 2000s, Yandex periodically put the Microsoft website at the top of the list for hemorrhoids.  Hundreds of humorous malicious links to microsoft.com with an appropriate anchor made the search engine think that the page responds well to this request.  ‚ÄúYandex‚Äù did not understand what ‚Äúhemorrhoids‚Äù was, he carried out a mechanical balancing and calculation of coefficients according to the relevance formula.  It is clear that in those days the sites were promoted by high-frequency queries that were not very relevant to the site's theme (targeting the target audience suffers, but the number of visitors redeems it).  Then a stereotype appeared about ‚ÄúSEOs, because of which TOP10 became nonsense - I am looking for Pushkin, and Yandex gives me credits and Viagra‚Äù. <br><br><h6>  Stage II (recent past) </h6><br>  The obvious way to reverse the situation is to increase the relevance of the content, which was done by search engines.  Now at the request of "hemorrhoids" microsoft.com never got into the issue, as this word is not found on the pages.  But a new way of manipulation has appeared: nauseous sheets with hundreds of keyword entries + a number of incoming links with anchors to increase credibility.  It was then that the stereotype ‚ÄúSEO people spoiled the site spread, placed on all the pages of nonsense to buy an iron for free the best irons how to choose reviews.‚Äù <br><br><h6>  Stage III (Present) </h6><br>  Until a strong AI has been created, the search engine most likely will not be able to understand the meaning of the text.  However, there are many ways to organize "quasi-understanding", which is quite enough to combat the illegitimate methods of promotion.  Frequency characteristics were introduced into the ranking formula, which distinguish a text written by a human for humans from a differently varying key word confusion.  If you fasten a good analyzer of uniqueness to combat synonymizing and autorewriting, put restrictions on the volume, classifier of subjects (‚Äúhemorrhoids‚Äù - illness, medicine; Microsoft - software), and then also machine learning technologies like ‚ÄúMatrixnet‚Äù and analysis of behavioral factors, the search engine will turn into a thing well protected from improper use.  This is what happened.  And now stereotypes about bad SEOs have little to do with working SEO - and not because everyone re-educated themselves and realized their transgressions.  It's just that modern search engines have created a situation in which the SEO should really improve the site in a purely human sense.  A bad, mutilated and miserable site will no longer fall into the TOP10, and if it does, it will immediately fly out under the pressure of more advanced competitors.  The reference mass is now used to rank obviously good sites, while its value does not decrease - applicants for places in the top ten for all commercially significant requests (which, under the influence of algorithms for increasing the diversity of the Spectrum type, can turn into nine, eight, seven and six) always more than ten. <br><br>  So what does SEO do in 2012?  He is not trying to trick the search engine and users.  On the contrary, it makes the site faster, applies a neat layout, semantic markup, writes original and readable content, works with user factors (time spent on the page, number of pages viewed, etc.) it is clear that you can only manipulate them by real quality improvement. site) and so on.  Each page is promoted to be really relevant, interesting and conversion-active - so that the visitor performs the required action and does not leave.  At the same time, the SEO can easily delegate work with external ranking factors (that is, build-up, support and weeding of the incoming reference mass) to an automated system.  Algorithms SeoPult buy and remove links better than even an advanced SEO tool worked with them manually.  And links are bought, by the way, on sites that are not harmful in any way: first, they are the so-called SOM (non-commercial sites that are created specifically for selling links, but they are quite normal information resources, they do not ‚Äúpollute the Internet‚Äù ), secondly, the exchange links sit neatly in blocks of the Yandex.Direct type, and nobody complains about them: everyone understands that the owner is free to make money on his website. <br><br>  Negative stereotypes about SEO are still alive, but working, effective SEO today is no longer described by them.  Some figures may continue to use grandfather's methods, their labors can be affected, but this is a matter of choosing a contractor, rather than technology and industry per se. <br><br><h5>  Future plans </h5><br>  In the upcoming articles we are planning to talk about linkbayting, optimizing landing pages, getting sites out of the search engine filters, and later about all the significant aspects of search advertising.  We welcome any feedback, are ready to answer questions and make special materials for your requests.  Thanks for attention! </habracut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/156797/">https://habr.com/ru/post/156797/</a></p>
