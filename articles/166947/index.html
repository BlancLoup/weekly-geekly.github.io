  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Asus vs asus</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The other day, Asus introduced new models of 7-inch Asus MeMo Pad 7 tablets. At first, I thought it was the Nexus 7, only in some cheaper bundling and without Google branding, but then I looked closer and realized that from Nexus 7 in the MeMo Pad 7 only the display diagonal 7 inches.  And while the MeMo Pad 7 will be worth only 3 mp cheaper than the Nexus 7. However, it will be, because according to Yandex.Market MeMo Pad 7 is not yet sold.  In general, some marketing trick in this whole story was presented to me.  I tried to figure it out. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, I think, Nexus 7 does not need any special presentation here.  Nevertheless, I‚Äôll make a reservation that this is a Nexus 7 with the latest version of Android Jelly Bean 4.2 firmware, which, among other things, brought on the tablet and multiplayer functionality.  That is, now on the same Nexus 7 tablet several users can be absolutely fully registered.  Moreover, both photos and other files of one user will not be available from the profile of another user, and vice versa.  Naturally, logging in to Nexus 7 under your own name, you will get all the applications that you installed on your tablet, you will receive, also naturally, in a logged in state.

That is, each family member can have his profile on the same tablet and, taking it in hand, receive his own completely customized device.  This is wildly awesome really!  I believe that the multiplayer functionality in Android Jelly Bean 4.2, is that with the help of which Android will try to resist the new mobile OSes, which appeared and that still appear in 2013. <br><br>  More details about all the innovations of Android Jelly Bean 4.2 on the Nexus 7 can be found in this review: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9XEdkvYqaE%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700002,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhC7fShWUE1HvPE3azAWSZi6taxsQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  All the more strange that the manufacturers are in no hurry to release devices on Android Jelly Bean 4.2.  On the other hand, this is not at all strange, because if earlier we had to buy by device for each user, now, with multiplayer functionality, it suffices to buy one device per family, for example.  This is a direct blow to the interests of manufacturers of devices.  No wonder the firmware Android Jelly Bean 4.2 is currently available only on two devices: Google Nexus 7 by Asus and Google Nexus 4 by LG.  That is, both of these devices, though released by different manufacturers, are developed and certified by Google itself.  But the manufacturers themselves are not in a hurry to release devices on Android Jelly Bean 4.2, preferring the Android version of Jelly Bean 4.1, in which almost everything is the same, but there is no multiplayer functionality. <br><br>  So recently introduced Asus MeMo Pad 7 work on Android Jelly Bean 4.1, that is, they do not have multiplayer functionality.  But this is not their only minus compared to the Nexus 7. Let's go through the hardware configuration.  As you know, the Nexus 7 is based on a 4-core NVIDIA Tegra 3 processor, operating at a frequency of 1.3 GHz, the resolution of its 7-inch display is 1200x800.  Asus MeMo Pad works on a single-core 1GHz VIA WM8950 processor (although its graphics card, though not the freshest, is very good: Mali-400), and the display resolution is 1024x600.  Remarkably, the technology on which the display is produced in the case of the MeMo Pad 7 is not indicated at all.  Only the display brightness is 350 nits, but the Nexus 7 has a magnificent IPS display with a brightness of 400 nits.  Like the Nexus 7, the MeMo Pad 7 does not have a main camera, only a front-facing 1 megapixel, albeit with an F2 / 0 diaphragm, which will give quite good photosensitivity.  They promise that this camera will be able to write 720p video with a frequency of 30 fps.  But the Nexus 7 1.2 megapixel camera, the diaphragm number of which I do not know, doesn‚Äôt seem to be complaining about its sensitivity when talking on Skype. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eed/0c6/929/eed0c6929de2d395c00fff169c988722.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Like the basic version of the Nexus 7, the MeMo Pad 7 does not have a 3G module.  This is despite the fact that <a href="">for those who wish, the Nexus 7 version with 3G is also available</a> .  It is really worth a little more expensive, already at the level of the iPad mini, which, in my opinion, however, Nexus 7 also wins in many articles.  However, comparing devices on different operating systems is not entirely correct, and therefore we will return to our heroes.  The Nexus 7 has a battery with a capacity of 4325 mAh, which actually provides 12-14 hours of work, but if we talk about maximum loads, then it will be enough for every 8-9 hours.  MeMo Pad 7 has a slightly smaller battery, 4270 mAh, but it is claimed that the battery life will be up to 7 hours.  How can this be?  Software optimization is worse, or is the VIA WM8950 single-core processor more voracious than NVIDIA Tegra 3?  On top of that, the MeMo Pad 7 weighs slightly more than the Nexus 7 - 358 gr.  against 340 from a certified Google tablet.  Yes, and it will be thicker, even if only 2 tenths of a millimeter. <br><br>  In general, in order not to tire with these comparisons (which, by the way, could be tabulated, but we‚Äôll leave this technique for the next time), I‚Äôll say that the MeMo Pad 7 loses the Nexus 7 in all respects. He has only one advantage: if he has the main flash memory in the amount of 8 or 16 GB, MeMo Pad 7 also has a slot for micro SD-cards and supports cards up to 32 GB.  How important this advantage is is to judge users, but personally to me, as the owner of the 16 GB version of the Nexus 7, it does not even seem to be important.  Not to mention the fact that there is a 32 GB version of the Nexus 7. <br><br>  There is one more advantage of MeMo Pad 7 over Nexus 7, well, if not an advantage, then a very useful difference.  MeMo Pad 7 supports all Asus proprietary services.  Asus WebStorage (cloud storage) provides 5 GB of storage for all MeMo Pad 7 users. In addition, there are other Asus branded services preinstalled in the firmware: SuperNote Lite, WebStorage Online Office, Asus Studio, Asus BuddyBuzz, Asus MyPainter, MyBitCast.  Not useless applications, just need to say. <br><br>  And now the most important thing.  MeMo Pad 7 will cost 7 tons in the Russian market.  That is, 7 tr.  will cost 8 GB version.  A 16 GB version will cost, probably, all 9 tr.  This is despite the fact that the 16 GB version of the Nexus 7 costs 10 tr.  At the expense of upgrading to Jelly Bean 4.2, there are no specific messages from Asus, however, it seems that the single-core processor simply will not pull the multiplayer functionality, well, or pull so that it would be better not to pull.  And how it works on this processor Jelly Bean 4.1 still needs to be seen.  In a word, in terms of software, the advantage of the Nexus 7, both momentary and in perspective, is obvious. <br><br>  In connection with all this, a question arises: where did the marketing specialists of Asus actually look at when they designed such a device, which, although cheaper than the Nexus 7, is also weaker at times?  Or, perhaps this is such a special marketing move: to release the device a little cheaper and much weaker to stimulate sales of the flagship device, which in this case is definitely the Nexus 7?  In principle, from a purely psychological point of view, such a move is possible.  In this case, MeMo Pad 7 acts only as a red rag, which will draw attention to the main product.  In the same connection, we should not forget that MeMo Pad 7 has not yet gone on sale, so this model is still a pure phantom.  But here's the Nexus 7, a very specific device and very cool.  I say this from my own experience. <br><br>  Immediately, perhaps, it will not be superfluous to add the fact that the Nexus 7 has already become, in fact, also a device for developers.  <a href="http://revazrezo.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/nexus-7-as-developer-device/">Read more about this in my blog</a> .  Well, for those who suddenly decide to buy the MeMo Pad 7 that appeared in the stores and accidentally read this article, my advice is: take the Nexus 7, it will serve you as 2, or even 3 MeMo Pad 7, or other tablets with Android 4.1.  Multiplayer functionality taxis.  Just zaparolil your profile and lent the device to a child or wife.  And everyone has their own profile.  Well, when Android 4.2 appears on other devices, this is a mystery covered in darkness.  I personally do not rule out that the same Samsung started bustling with its Tizen just because Jelly Bean 4.2 had a multiplayer functionality.  In any case, this chip adds fuel to the fire of the warrior software platforms.  And Android, despite my fairly calm attitude towards it, spoke great here. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/166947/">https://habr.com/ru/post/166947/</a></p>
