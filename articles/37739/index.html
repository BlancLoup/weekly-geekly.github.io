I worked my karma.  In general, the word karma in modern runet is used in a completely different meaning than it actually means (again, I refer you to the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259A%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0">wiki</a> ). <br><br>  So ‚Äúkarma‚Äù is not a rating, as we used to think, this action, or rather ‚Äúcause-effect‚Äù.  And when the guys from <a href="http://futurico.ru/">Futuriko</a> introduced these concepts in their resources, they were mistaken, perhaps intentionally (painfully beautiful and mysterious word). 
      <br>

      In connection with this misunderstanding, an idea was born today - what if we make such a rating system that would take into account actions aimed not at the user, but from the user.  Perhaps the democratic component of socializing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãratings will suffer a little, but you can win in many other ways. <br><br>  So, what is the concept of the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãa ‚Äúnew karma‚Äù. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <strong>Evaluation action</strong> <br><br>  The user puts the assessment.  Evaluates content and comments on other users' content.  As a result, some kind of average estimate is formed.  And the closer the user approaches his average value, the better his karma becomes. <br><br>  On the technical side, this can be difficult to implement.  Because on the fly you will have to do a lot of operations and load the server, because all the changes in karma should be done, for example, once a day, during the least activity of users, somewhere deep at night. <br><br>  <strong>Visiting action</strong> <br><br>  For a resource, user activity is important.  The user in the era of the web with a deuce and zero - there is a resource.  And if the user is idle - he kills the resource.  And killing is bad karma. <br><br>  Therefore, plus definitely those who view pages, vote, write comments and most importantly adds content (especially these people). <br><br>  And the minus immediately as soon as this someone starts to statistically less wander through the resource.  You come every day - well, but just stopped walking - the karma crawled down. <br><br>  <strong>Action result action</strong> <br><br>  Oil is oily, but I will try to explain what I had in mind.  It's one thing if you add content, you're good, for that you are a plus.  But it‚Äôs quite another thing if this content is cruelly minus - it means you are a pest, then you kill a resource - karma is down, and with great speed. <br><br>  This is perhaps the most terrible social component of the "new karma", after, perhaps, the "assessment actions." <br><br>  <strong>Referrals action</strong> <br><br>  This item refers to those resources that are registered exclusively by invitation.  It is logical and natural that your karma should somehow depend on the karma of those invited by you.  First and foremost, your ability to invite should depend on the karma of your referrals.  If they mostly have bad karma, then you should not be given invites, since you lead someone to the resource, and if your friends are with good karma, then you should pay extra invites, well, plus triple karma;) <br><br>  In general, every action or inaction must be reflected in karma.  It remains only to give each action weight.  But this is a completely different article, I hope you will help me answer this question in your comments. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37739/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37739/</a></p>
