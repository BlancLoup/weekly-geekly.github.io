Maybe it's time to get out into the world? <br>  Whatever you say - <a name="habracut"></a>  :) <br><br>  Back in 2005, it was my turn to acquire my own apartment. <br>  The year was difficult, especially in the area of ‚Äã‚Äãapartment purchases - my neighbor still hasn‚Äôt received housing.  And how many deceived investors in Russia live - only horror, and a topic for another conversation. <br><br>  So - in the yard in 2005.  Paid apartment in the good city of Podolsk. <br>  We are waiting for settlement. <br>  At the same time looking for with whom we will live. <br>  For these purposes, the site used <a href="http://tsj.ru/">tsj.ru</a> and ... Podolsk city forum. <br>  After some time, the neighbors had accumulated so much that they were simply banned from the forum, and tsj ... tsj is not convenient for communication :( <br>  And we moved to our forum, and continued Tama talk.  Sometimes they gathered and booze together.  And so it went on for a year and a half, until the house was rented out. <br>  There were a lot of topics for discussion - both ‚Äúwhat and how in the new city of Podolsk‚Äù, and ‚Äúthey threw the power cable on us - soon move in‚Äù, and the issues of obtaining keys, phonebooks, telephones and other connections to tyrnet. <br>  Now in the tops of questions on the property and parking. <br>  Our MC has even organized its own broadcasting channel and has tamaya clips with reporting ...

      After a year, my partner will do the same thing, this time in Curnico.  And saytik and they were already more abruptly - not only the forum, but also the list of regulatory documents and other "events" <br>  And the people of Tama are always 300 people hanging out (but Tama is not one house, but a whole district was built) <br><br>  Maybe you have a home / city grid where you communicate (download movies and scream) <br><br>  2005 year‚Ä¶ <br>  In 2005, there were no classmates yet. <br>  And neighbors - neighbors were born on August 29, 2005 at 11.59. <br>  It was at this time that the first design was sent to me. <br>  I have only invented the idea itself - tovarischi, who can think creatively, expanded it themselves and ... the project never saw the light ... <br>  But he could be like this <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b34/d4f/790/b34d4f79030f24bce8f20d4295d0f924.jpg"><br>  (a little more about the history of development can be <a href="http://www.esosedi.ru/blog/post/developing/po_itogam_trehletki/37/index.html">read on the site itself</a> ) <br><br>  Only in July 2007, the work continued in the same direction, and then I suddenly (with HORROR) discovered MirTesen and understood what a google map is. <br>  The week went on rewriting and rethinking the concept, well, and the database was simply destroyed ... <br>  As a result, I realized that the <b>world is not small - it is huge and interesting!</b> <br><br>  The development went further, I displayed on the map of the city and allowed people to put their house on this map, and communicate ... <br><br>  And then I ran into <a href="http://wikimapia.org/">Wikimapia</a> . <br>  Well, the story repeated :) <br>  And for six months, the server every two seconds ate information from the Mapia map (with which it was impossible to establish contacts) <br>  Now Kravl is completely stopped ... <br>  Do not consider me a clone of Wikimapia, which simply stole the data from it. <br>  I originally had a different idea and concept, and a different kind of data presentation, and with a different purpose. <br><br>  What do we have at the moment? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4c9/7dd/13f/4c97dd13fbeaee09d90179a9126cdfb7.jpg"><br><br>  We have a world map on the other side of the screen. <br>  We have a map showing Wikimapia objects. <br>  We have cities, towns and settlements of our Homeland, for which (partially) information is provided from Wikipedia <br>  We have real snapshots of these objects from Panoraorio. <br>  We have the opportunity to structure this whole thing, to unite into rings and ‚Äúfavorites‚Äù (a mixture of ‚Äúfavorites and cuts aroundme) and ... find out <strong>where and how you and your neighbors live</strong> . <br>  <s>We have the opportunity to add your home to the map and communicate within it.</s> <br>  No, unfortunately this we do not have: ( <br><br>  When I realized that soon the anniversary, I tried very hard to have time to implement (more precisely, unlock the functionality) what was originally intended, but unfortunately the project went very far and did not support the ‚Äúold‚Äù code anymore. <br>  There are no houses on the map. <br>  Now you can add them in principle, but there‚Äôs no sense :) <br>  But, since we are three years old now, I have to submit a project. <br>  Puffed at night, but did not have time .., and at work loaded and sent on a business trip. <br>  But in any case - the day will come and you will become one more houses. <br>  Home where <a href="http://www.esosedi.ru/">you</a> live <a href="http://www.esosedi.ru/">and your neighbors</a> <br>  Just a little more electronic than now :) <br><br>  I will not describe what the site has to do, and what it actually does. <br>  Probably it will be more interesting to understand something new for yourself - it helps self-development :) <br>  Do not kick the design, it will die soon and I already have a new one (kinda like normal) <br><br>  Just ... for service to live, life is required. <br>  We are the guides of life on that strontium of the screen. <br>  If anyone likes the service - I will be waiting for you on my pages <br>  And if you don‚Äôt like it, we will live and develop further, maybe someday later we will be friends with you. <br>  We will be a little closer to each other, we <a href="http://www.esosedi.ru/">will become friends and neighbors</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/38405/">https://habr.com/ru/post/38405/</a></p>
