      <br>
      I, [FULL NAME], have been your regular customer for more than 5 years (since 2004, contract number [number], phone [number]).  All this time I was very loyal to your company - I used your services exclusively, recommended you as a reliable operator, to my family, to my friends and colleagues.  Until 2009, you showed yourself as an exceptionally reliable and predictable partner you can trust.  As an example of this, I can cite the story when you, without notice of the subscribers, significantly changed the conditions for providing the Home Region service in October 2007, and for two days while I was on a business trip, I spent more than 1,000 rubles in addition to my tariff, low volume of telephone conversations.  A few days later your manager contacted me, apologized, spoke about the new conditions.  The money has been returned to the account.  You always met when I needed to replace a sim card or set up a telephone in your office. <br>  However, in 2009 something changed in your client policy. <br>  Firstly, the number of all sorts of advertising has increased. <br>  Secondly, in the first half of this year, my ‚ÄúFriends‚Äù tariff was changed with the notification only through your official website.  I noticed it only after several months, according to the increased debit amounts - the tariff became per-minute.  I had to endure and this - formally, your company did not violate the law, your competitors were also seen in similar manipulations, and, most importantly, the constancy of the phone number is of great (but not unlimited) importance for me.  Moreover, here you offered an interesting tariff with per-second charging - Family 2009. After switching to the new tariff, I began to regularly visit your website (about once a month) in order to track changes according to the tariff used.  Apparently you do not have the technical capabilities to send the appropriate sms-notification, as opposed to advertising sms-mailing. <br>  Thirdly, even my regular visits to the site of your company did not save from the next pitfalls - now you have several ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù tariffs, the last ‚ÄúFamily_2009‚Äù (per second, no connection fee), but my tariff is ‚ÄúFamily 2009‚Äù (without underscore) and already in the archive and with a connection fee.  This tariff transformation was not immediately detectable; your marketers did their best - the substitution was almost imperceptible if you didn‚Äôt check the balance after each conversation. <br>  As far as I understand, your company offers to pay me every few months 90 rubles (the cost of switching from one ‚Äúfamily‚Äù tariff to another) for the right to use true per-second billing (that is, without connection charges and other similar fees). <br>  I understand perfectly well what a ‚Äúchange in the competitive situation in the market‚Äù is, and I clearly understand that you often have to change your tariff plans.  And, as a client, I am ready to pay for quality services and good service, but I‚Äôm not ready to endure the relationship according to the principle ‚Äúthe client will eat everything and not notice‚Äù. <br>  I have the following sentence: you apologize and transfer me free of charge to the updated tariff "Family_2009".  Otherwise, I will be forced to switch to another mobile operator, despite the costs associated with changing the number. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  [signature] <br>  11/13/2009 </blockquote><br>  On the same day he received the standard answer: <br><blockquote>  Your message has been received.  We will answer you within a day (on weekdays).  We will respond to the message sent on weekends or holidays on the next working day.  It is important for us that you get an answer in a timely manner, so to solve an urgent question, please contact us by phone +7 (495) 974-88-88 or 0611 (from a mobile phone). <br><br>  Have fun! <br>  Your "Beeline". </blockquote><br>  A little later - another letter: <br><blockquote>  Dear Customer! <br>  Your application has been received and accepted. <br>  Your Beeline. </blockquote><br>  And, finally, today they called him, clarified his passport data, apologized and transferred him free of charge to the per-second tariff, offering to read the news feed for the future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75870/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75870/</a></p>
