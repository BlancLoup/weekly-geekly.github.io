Those who want to program, but do not know where to start - this is my example. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  There is no team, I do it alone from time to time, solely in the mood.  He spoke the sounds into the microphone, took music and graphics from free banks, because he never tried to draw or write music. <br><br>  Someone will say, they say, it looks like a collective farm, but friends and relatives praise, and this of course is also nice. <br><br>  Corona SDK is a cross-platform engine using Lua language.

Design, I admit, pluck your eyes, for me the main thing was what would work, programming for the sake of programming - to hell with the design and gameplay. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ee1/ccf/8a0/ee1ccf8a0bd74b55b7d74e75d3ff32df.JPG" alt="image"></div><br>  It turned out funny with this game - the name was originally Bubble boo, it turned out that this name is a registered trademark of someone's, and there is somewhere a game with that name, but not in GooglePlay.  A month after the publication came a threat from Google - remove, they say, for copyright infringement.  Renamed.  But, apparently, that game was advertised and for a month while on GooglePlay it was not there, and mine was with their name, I received 3000+ installations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/26d/16c/0b526d16c16d46e68be018fa34be2a99.JPG" alt="image"></div><br>  The next game was the development of the code of these balls.  The turtle from the language of Logo (if anyone remembers computer science in the school of the 80s, now I don‚Äôt know what they are learning) mixed up in my head with the childhood toy Tamagotchi.  There was no scenario or a certain understanding of what should have happened almost to the very end. <br><br>  And so what happened is what the children like.  Now busy with his next masterpiece.  What and you want. <br><br>  Sources (can someone help, a small amount of code comments is present): <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://github.com/vkafe/bubbleEasy">Bubble Easy</a> <br>  ‚Üí <a href="https://github.com/vkafe/heyturtle">Hey turtle</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/322092/">https://habr.com/ru/post/322092/</a></p>
