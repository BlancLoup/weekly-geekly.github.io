Project details</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/407/519/9ff/4075199ff7214f46aa6e1ad01bb01091.jpg"><br><br>  IBM, in conjunction with the announcement of expanding the strategy of using open source technologies on the mainframe and other decisions of the Open Source developer community, introduced two new mainframes in the <a href="http://www.ibm.com/linuxone">LinuxOne</a> lineup.  Mainframes are positioned as the most secure Linux systems in their industry.  Plus, it is also the most powerful secure corporate server, which is adapted to work with hybrid cloud technologies and mobile applications. <br><br>  IBM has decided to open the mainframe code for the open source software community.  In particular, IBM's mainframe technology was discovered to detect problems and prevent enterprise system failures, improve performance across all platforms and provide better integration with the wider network and cloud. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  LinuxOne mainframes </h3><br>  As mentioned above, two servers running LinuxOne are running.  The first, called LinuxOne Emperor, is based on the IBM z13 mainframe with its Z13 processor.  The system is designed to work in large corporations to solve a large number of business problems.  The second - Rockchopper, is intended for medium-sized businesses.  It works with a Z12 processor.

There is no such indicator for any single Linux system.  LinuxONE Rockhopper, which opens the list of solutions, is designed specifically for customers from emerging economies for whom speed, security and availability of mainframes are important, but in a smaller package. <br><br>  Note that the name of the mainframe was chosen for a reason - the name of the species of emperor penguins, the largest penguins in the world, was taken as a basis. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/282/623/3fb/2826233fbfae4ac099511e73194e4df0.jpg"><br>  <i><a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%2525D0%252598%2525D0%2525BC%2525D0%2525BF%2525D0%2525B5%2525D1%252580%2525D0%2525B0%2525D1%252582%2525D0%2525BE%2525D1%252580%2525D1%252581%2525D0%2525BA%2525D0%2525B8%2525D0%2525B9_%2525D0%2525BF%2525D0%2525B8%2525D0%2525BD%2525D0%2525B3%2525D0%2525B2%2525D0%2525B8%2525D0%2525BD">The emperor penguin</a> looks to the future of mainframes with confidence</i> <br><br>  Both systems can work with software such as Apache Spark, MariaDB, PostgreSQL and Chef.  The company will provide open source software and industry-specific tools, including Apache Spark, Docker, Node.js, MongoDB, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Chef for working with IBM z Systems, to provide customers with more choices and ensure flexibility when deploying hybrid cloud environments.  Canonical and IBM have also announced the launch of a joint initiative to promote the use of Ubuntu Linux on IBM z Systems, opening up access to mainframe features for the Ubuntu developer community. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4b0/aa2/2cf/4b0aa22cf11d4df09ed3082a2675f797.jpg"><br><br>  ‚ÄúFifteen years ago, IBM surprised many industry representatives by installing Linux on mainframes.  Today, more than a third of IBM mainframe customers are working on Linux, ‚Äùsays Tom Rosamilia, senior vice president, IBM Systems.  - This announcement once again confirms IBM‚Äôs commitment to supporting the Open Source developer community.  Combining the best of open source systems with advanced capacity will allow customers to cope with new mobile workloads and efficiently manage hybrid cloud computing.  Given the successful experience of using Linux on mainframes, we continue to expand the boundaries of capabilities for conventional servers that do not have increased requirements for security and performance. " <br><br><h3>  The company will provide new open source software and industry tools for working with mainframes. </h3><br>  Significantly expanding business opportunities, IBM has provided key Linux open source software technologies that meet industry standards for LinuxONE and IBM z Systems.  These include Apache Spark, Node.js, MongoDB, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Chef and Docker.  These technologies can work on the mainframe as smoothly as on other platforms, without requiring additional skills or advantages in terms of performance. <br><br>  IBM initiated the creation of a virtual environment on mainframes.  Today, the company offers a large selection of virtualization solutions, empowering the new LinuxONE system with virtual machine functions using the KVM hypervisor, which uses a set of open standards, like any other Linux server.  SUSE, the leading Linux distributor, will provide initial KVM support for mainframes. <br><br>  Canonical and IBM also announced the launch of a joint initiative aimed at promoting the use of Ubuntu Linux at IBM z Systems.  Canonical plans to distribute the Ubuntu operating system for LinuxONE and z Systems, including the third Linux distribution.  SUSE and Red Hat already support this distribution format.  Canonical also plans to support a KVM mainframe software solution. <br><br><h3>  The company will join the new Linux Foundation project in the face of increasing demand for mainframes from Open Source developers. </h3><br>  For the open source software community, expanding access to IBM mainframe technology has become the largest one-time opening of mainframe application code by IBM.  The company also allowed access to the source code of predictive analytics solutions, which provide continuous monitoring to determine the unusual behavior of the system and minimize its consequences.  Such code can be used by developers to create a system similar in function and ability to respond. <br><br>  IBM's contribution will help launch the new <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/news-media/announcements/2015/08/linux-foundation-brings-together-industry-heavyweights-advance">Open Mainframe Project</a> , sponsored by the non-profit Linux Foundation, which develops the Linux ecosystem.  IBM together with the Linux Foundation will support the Open Mainframe Project, whose members are about ten organizations from the scientific sphere, the public and corporate sectors.  The goal of the project is the development, implementation and promotion of Linux on mainframes. <br><br>  ‚ÄúLinux technology on mainframes has reached a critical mass, so developers, manufacturers, users and academia need an independent platform where they can work together to promote Linux tools and technologies, thereby bringing innovative technologies to businesses and industries,‚Äù said Jim Zemlin. Executive Director, Linux Foundation.  - Open Mainframe Project is a response to the expectations of Linux users.  This project aims to support the development of an open-software ecosystem with the goal of universally utilizing the unique features of mainframes for security, availability and performance. ‚Äù <br><br><h3>  IBM will provide free access to LinuxONE Developer Cloud </h3><br>  As part of the announcement, IBM will also provide access to the mainframe for developers of open source software.  The unprecedented step of the company is intended to contribute to the creation and promotion of innovations in this area.  IBM is launching the LinuxONE Developer Cloud platform, to which the developer community will have free access.  The cloud performs the function of a virtual R &amp; D mechanism for creating, testing and launching new applications, including checking compatibility with interoperability systems, mobile and hybrid cloud applications. <br><br>  Marist College and the School of Information Sciences at Syracuse University will host the clouds, through which developers will get free access to the IBM LinuxONE virtual mainframe.  As part of the program, IBM will also create a separate cloud platform for independent software vendors at IBM Centers in Dallas (USA), Beijing (China) and B√∂blingen (Germany).  It will provide developers with access and a free trial period for working with LinuxONE resources to connect, test and evaluate the performance of new applications for LinuxONE and z Systems platforms. <br><br>  New financial proposals for the LinuxONE portfolio provide for flexible pricing conditions and the amount of resources offered.  This will allow enterprises to pay only for what they actually use, and it is easy to increase capacity in the face of growing business.  New LinuxONE systems are available today. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265413/</a></p>
