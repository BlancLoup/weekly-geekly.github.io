  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Webinar vs. live meeting</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><h5>  Have you ever wondered if you should go to webinars instead of live meetings with clients? </h5><br>  If your answer is "YES", then you think in the right, more precisely, in a profitable direction.  The West is already overwhelmed by the popularity of Internet training.  And in the near future, this wave will cover the Russian market of info-business. <br><br>  According to estimates by <i>Training Industry</i> in the global market of training services, $ 300 billion is rotated. A third of this amount is accounted for by the United States.  The share of the Russian market, in comparison with the States, is negligible, but every year it increases exponentially.  This is due to the growth of consumer interest in various kinds of training via the Internet. <br><br>  Many already successful business trainers recommend diversifying work with clients by introducing a new form - webinars.  Let's compare live seminars and their online version.

    <h4>  <b>Webinar</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7dc/89b/8db/7dc89b8dbe8031b3dc13a700679b7807.jpg" alt="image"><br><h5>  pros </h5><br><h6>  Time is money </h6><br>  Save time and effort to get to your destination.  Just enough time to turn on Skype on your laptop / tablet / phone and you are fully ready to go.  Thus, you can conduct several seminars per day without leaving your own apartment. <br><br><h6>  No rental costs </h6><br>  There is no need to rent a specially equipped room for meetings with clients.  This significantly reduces the cost of the webinar. <br><br><h6>  No "side" costs </h6><br>  Providing those who came with lunch, drinks and other related things is also not necessary. <br><br><h6>  You have thousands of students </h6><br>  A non-limited number of seminar participants: on such sites as SeeMedia, you can conduct seminars for several thousand people. <br><br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br><h6>  Webinar - a short genre </h6><br>  Too long webinar can tire the client and he, most likely, will not tolerate to the end.  Keep the attention of the audience is very difficult. <br><br><h6>  Low impact </h6><br>  During the webinar, the power of influence on the audience decreases, because  people may not be fully focused on what is happening in the monitor, be distracted and miss important things. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <b>Live Workshop</b> </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e11/a20/41c/e11a2041c6ef1b32dea6e4d48d76e2d3.jpg" alt="image"><br><h5>  pros </h5><br><h6>  Long sessions </h6><br>  Only with live communication is it possible to conduct long sessions, designed for several hours of dense work with the audience. <br>  Feedback.  Another advantage of live communication is the possibility of direct dialogue with the audience. <br><br><h6>  Customer need to know in person </h6><br>  A personal meeting with a client will help make contact.  This is the key to long-term and fruitful collaboration. <br>  The effect of "charisma".  A seminar is, first of all, a public statement.  Live performances in front of clients (good live performances, of course) increase your authority and influence on the clients.  In addition, it is a powerful tool for influencing the audience. <br><br><h5>  Minuses </h5><br><h6>  Financial costs </h6><br>  Live seminars require the cost of renting space, accompanying materials, technical equipment, etc. <br><br><h6>  Periodicity </h6><br>  Of course, you can arrange two trainings per day, but in this case, the turnout will be minimal. <br><br>  We see that both the tools of interaction with the audience, webinars and live training prove their effectiveness in completely different tasks. <br>  Live training is the basis of coaching, it helps to win the client, the goal is to have the maximum impact on him, while you have the opportunity to fully control the process.  This form is most fruitful in terms of results, but it requires certain costs. <br>  At the same time, webinars are a more ‚Äúdry‚Äù form, leaving almost no opportunity for communication with customers, especially in mass seminars, where the block of answers to questions runs the risk of becoming a booth.  However, this is an ideal form for solving current tasks, for example, routine homework checks, as well as 45-minute sessions. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/190842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/190842/</a></p>
