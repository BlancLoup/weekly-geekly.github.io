The event promised to be bright and interesting, and what came out of it and what the conference remembered for me personally - read under the cut. <br><br>  Digitale took two days in two streams.  The first stream is aimed at business owners.  The experienced marketers who ate the dog in this business would hardly have known the sacred revelations, but it would be interesting for the managers of the company to hear how the wonderful world of marketing works. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The second stream for practitioners in the field of Internet marketing: contextual advertising, SMM, mailing lists and the like.  The conference program is quite rich, interesting topics of reports, both on the first stream, and on the second.  So sometimes I had to rush headlong from one hall to another.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/250/9d1/85a/2509d185a95f422fb54a72428f55891b.JPG"><br><br><br>  After the warm and welcoming words of the organizers of the conference, as with the benefit and advantage of spending the next two days, an unshaven man appeared on the scene.  As it turned out, the bearded man is a very successful entrepreneur and, in the past, the general director of Raduga Smile and Vigoda.ru, and now he is at the helm of Get Taxi. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/44d/74d/189/44d74d1891164fb2971e514e6fb30514.JPG"><br><br><br>  Vladimir Marinovich talked about how offline and online marketing should interact in the company, and in fact troll the inability of digital marketers to set the right goals and objectives for themselves.  ‚ÄúLikes, tweets and reposts are, of course, super, but tell me how much money your activity will bring?‚Äù Is the main idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe report. <br><br>  Marinovich spoke incendiaryly, joked a lot, occasionally urging the hall to raise hands, clap their hands: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d88/549/980/d885499809644af2b8c99ce703478839.JPG"><br><br><br>  There was an endless energy and a wave of positive energy from the performance, which was very beneficial - the morning portion of coffee did not have time to act, but I wanted to recharge. <br><br>  By the way, Yell had a free coffee service for everyone.  And periodically, the number of people willing to drink coffee exceeded the number of those who listened to the reports: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/073/67e/2cd/07367e2cd8ce4138865c293cb8f97624.jpg"><br><br><br>  Note to future partners and sponsors of various conferences is simple and uncomplicated mechanics for attracting attention.  At the same time, the Yell stand was popular, and people were always crowded around it: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/c8b/483/933c8b483e6d4ceb84b4dd060c47602e.JPG"><br><br><br>  The next performance, which I decided to listen to, was held in the second hall.  In terms of the atmosphere, what is happening here was very different from what was happening in the first hall, and resembled a small small party.  The company of good and good friends gathered to discuss pressing issues. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/613/0f6/394/6130f639472c4b45b663eb78b4a6a330.JPG"><br><br><br>  Charming Svetlana Demina talked about how to get the most out of internet business and increase conversions on the site.  For me personally, the performance turned out to be extremely banal.  Similar material in the network dime a dozen.  The report was saved only by Svetlana‚Äôs ability to work with the public, and of course a perky smile: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e9a/810/38d/e9a81038d1cd4d3abf62e20c1fa10b12.JPG"><br><br><br>  On stage, Sergei Slavinsky with the report "How not to become a marketing loser."  Diametrically opposite in tone and mood is the performance of the two previous ones.  No jokes and cats.  Serious and mature.  Hall fell silent. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/042/8f3/6a1/0428f36a1f7345fead37229385d988b0.JPG"><br><br><br>  Several clever thoughts from Sergey: ‚ÄúStudying in an entertaining way does not work.  Deep knowledge is given in a serious learning process.  Be a nerd, read complicated books ‚Äù,‚Äú Alien experience and cases are not always effective ‚Äù,‚Äú An idea without an implementation mechanism costs nothing ‚Äù.  Speech Slavinsky - must have for all start-up startups. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a7a/77d/070/a7a77d0709c345498cc26c9c6098dd60.JPG"><br><br><br>  Ahead of us was waiting for a lunch break, which means time to wander through the back streets and margins of the conference, look at partners' stands, chat with interesting people, make useful contacts. <br><br>  At the entrance to the lobby of the conference participants meets the CallTouch company booth.  The guys decided not to invent the wheel again and attracted the attention of the old-fashioned way: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff0/d33/73b/ff0d3373b2f4481396ecd7ca609b7188.JPG"><br><br><br>  I don‚Äôt want to talk about his being beaten, but I couldn‚Äôt overcome the desire to take pictures with two pretty girls: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/78a/b6d/d13/78ab6dd13cfe4c5b919c9ebad2ec2552.JPG"><br><br><br>  Unfortunately, I missed their speech, but it promised to be interesting.  The intriguing title of the report promised to reduce the cost of incoming circulation by five times ... <br><br>  But the stand of SendSay company is a mailing list service, an analogue of Mailchimp, ‚Äúbut only with a Russian soul‚Äù.  Of the unique service chips, I would point out adaptive email templates, including smartphone support, a Russian-language interface and the ability to create complex mechanics and triggers for sending emails after a specific user action or event: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0f2/70f/cac/0f270fcac836489b8c2e411014846b1d.JPG"><br><br><br>  Especially popular as a means of attracting attention, enjoyed augmented reality.  Immediately two companies used it to promote their stands.  The first one is Vrealnosti.com: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81e/3fd/5b0/81e3fd5b0660460bb5dd2c3b0272db90.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2a5/98b/919/2a598b91932b494cb99145c7b761bb9d.JPG"><br><br><br>  The guys were so impressed with the success of Google's virtual reality glasses that they decided to make their own counterpart.  They work on the same principle as Google, but only Vrealnosti.com offers to purchase them as a gift for business partners.  Well, well, the idea, though not original, seems to me better to give such glasses than a faceless notebook or a pen with a logo. <br><br><br>  The second stand of the company "Social King".  Wearing glasses you can feel inside the pipeline passing along the route Taishet - Kozmino.  I did not dare to try them on an empty stomach, but my colleague happily played with them: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/056/fe2/1d2/056fe21d26c2499ba6085d023c494b71.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ebb/6de/86f/ebb6de86f6374787b3efde99d3cfd2b6.jpg"><br><br><br>  Cookies with the logo of popular social networks at their own stand: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/22c/419/f17/22c419f176464b31a0be13841cf6fb9a.jpg"><br><br><br>  But there is an Instabox.  Anyone can make a series of instant photos.  We also decided not to miss the chance and took pictures: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/cec/cde/73c/ceccde73c88a436db0ba445f2fdde892.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/714/bf5/0eb/714bf50eb3be48ae9e851584c68e88b8.JPG"><br><br><br>  The lunch break was rapidly coming to an end, so we quickly ran over the stands of the other participants.  Here are some of them. <br><br>  Sape is the largest reference exchange in Russia.  I did not notice any special activity around the booth, although I liked its futuristic design and the friendly staff of the company, ready to talk about the advantages of the service: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7d2/438/112/7d24381126e44fc288e50a37a4e1595b.JPG"><br><br><br>  Obit - I think, needs no introduction.  The stand was decorated in a very corporate and dry style.  A serious man in a sweater and tie with a tenacious look catches potential customers: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/85e/43e/996/85e43e99616848a999aec5697c1aaa4c.JPG"><br><br><br>  Lama is a communications agency.  The stand looked more like a bar in a Jamaican pub: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7f1/e31/272/7f1e312724004734b91deda1ffd1f674.jpg"><br><br><br>  After lunch, Alexander Levitas was waiting for us with a story about the tools of rapid sales growth.  Alexander is positioning himself as a partisan marketing specialist.  The essence of which is how to get maximum gesheft with minimum cost.  Alexander acted very intelligently, correctly delivered speech, colorful epithets, clearly articulated thoughts.  Personally, I was extremely impressed by his creative image with a scarf casually tied around his neck.  The report also made a positive impression.  Alexander shared interesting and not always ordinary ways of increasing sales. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/57d/c42/beb/57dc42beb11648e298e8f88536e47fa6.jpg"><br><br><br>  I especially remember the story of Fujifilm entering the American market.  At that time, Kodak reigned in America, and, in order to press it, multimillion-dollar investments in this market were needed to develop its retail sales network.  Fujifilm acted much easier and more cunning, having agreed with a large pharmacy chain about placing its products.  On Monday, sales points were opened across the country with Fujifilm products.  Entry into the market was almost without the cost of a retail sales network deployment. <br><br>  Dmitry Potapenko closed the first day of the conference with the report ‚ÄúHard marketing from the owner‚Äù.  Dmitry in a harsh manner told about the crisis and the stagnation of Russian business and the economy.  The aggressive manner of performance seemed to make a strong impression on those present, and no one dared to ask Dmitry questions.  Only one girl took courage and said that she was crazy about his report. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/705/d1f/746/705d1f74658d4173ac4d08b8e564680a.JPG"><br><br><br>  Everyone knows that conferences have practically ceased to be a place for obtaining valuable knowledge in the industry.  This is rather a party for initiates, a place where you can meet potential customers, talk with colleagues.  The Digitale team contributed to this even before the conference.  All conference participants had access to a section of the site where they could meet and chat online or arrange a meeting at the conference itself: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76b/a41/270/76ba412700404bae9e0e5d04f69e73a0.png"><br><br><br>  Anyone present could speak on Instagram or Twitter with the hashtags #dconf and #digitale.  The tape was broadcast on several screens in the first and second conference rooms.  Here are a few comments from the participants: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/015/634/052/0156340520e548a5a6fb46972be64c7d.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/752/f0b/8f3/752f0b8f350645a3bfb6b881a453cb9f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41a/641/bd8/41a641bd81c24716aee77d1955e64d38.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86c/f7b/60c/86cf7b60c4144018910a7c1a18f64272.png"><br><br>  The second day of the conference was less entertaining for me and much more useful from the point of view of the presentations.  Even stretching my fingers well, I barely managed to take notes.  But not without fun.  In the middle of the day in the main hall the guys from Robyuro launched a huge drone.  At the time of launch, the entire hall fell silent in fear, and you could hear the beating of your own heart: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7fa/abd/8d4/7faabd8d4c9d499385397e504a2bcec8.jpg"><br><br><br>  Denis Kaplunov began his speech with pimping.  At first, he offered to raise his hands to all single girls, and then to all unmarried guys.  And of course, they all have to meet.  In fact, Denis so deftly beat the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhis report.  Each of us knows something that the other does not know.  Sharing knowledge and experience is the basis of content marketing.  Share your knowledge with others, and you will be happy.  Denis himself shared a life hack for writing emails and commercial offers.  His company sent handwritten emails.  And this way of personalizing the treatment gave a very good result. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/641/0ae/f64/6410aef64f6c41d78d249b8c96aa4a2e.JPG"><br><br><br>  The speech of Leonid Bugaev made a double impression.  On the one hand, he very strongly deviated from the topic of the report.  The story was poorly structured, and frequent insertions of stories from personal experience and the experience of large companies only distracted, creating complete chaos in the head.  On the other hand, at the end of his report, Leonid gave almost step-by-step instructions on how to sell a specialist to his professional skills and knowledge. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a5e/912/57f/a5e91257f83241828bc8fa629f52d275.JPG"><br><br><br>  On stage Ilya Balakhnin.  A lot of jokes and humor, but at the same time all of the case and without excess water.  Very bright and intense performance, which made a huge sensation with the public.  The hall burst into applause, and then Ilya was surrounded by the conference participants and did not want to let him go for a long time.  Someone asked questions, and someone just took pictures. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/351/2b2/38b/3512b238bd9949ecb2635c3e76d3f60b.JPG"><br><br><br>  Well, what a conference can do without cute and charming girls.  There were enough of them both among the speakers, and among the companies that represented their business at the stands, and among the participants of the conference: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/15e/edc/650/15eedc650ec54d70bd859a5405982758.JPG"><br><br><br>  Service promotion videos Videoseed and their charming and smiling employee: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a95/e20/4f5/a95e204f5c254ae0ba613c2adb0dcf89.JPG"><br><br><br>  And here is Get Taxi.  The speech of their CEO opened the first day of the conference: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/99a/4c6/57f/99a4c657f63244638f3c71396bd5d2ba.JPG"><br><br><br>  Very friendly and responsive girls at the reception were always ready to help: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/036/6d9/3e8/0366d93e87c649cd97ebe95dc0479c18.JPG"><br><br><br>  The girl photographer was tired by the end of the second day of the conference and decided to get some rest.  Or maybe she just decided to post something on social networks: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/86e/ddf/c0a/86eddfc0af484748aea6477c0ec8aaa5.JPG"><br><br><br>  Generally, an extremely informal atmosphere reigned at the conference.  Bean bags were scattered around the perimeter so that anyone tired could lie down and rest: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e49/a6f/965/e49a6f965c4b4ee09da29df9095c91df.JPG"><br><br><br>  Just charming conference participants: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9bd/bf2/be1/9bdbf2be145146a085e914b1efd99410.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/944/139/7ca/9441397ca125407488196febe7099d24.JPG"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1f2/d99/14f/1f2d9914fc204631b83a747d81663884.JPG"><br><br><br>  But this girl I remember most of all.  Not always, you know, at a marketing conference you will meet a girl in military uniform: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1bb/5f0/8c8/1bb5f08c81b24967a144cb132b9e78b6.jpg"><br><br><br>  The conference was closed by the marketing expert of ‚ÄúAll Russia‚Äù Igor Mann with a speech on how to return customers who have run away from you.  According to Mann, returning an old customer is much easier and cheaper than attracting several new ones.  One cannot but agree with him, but not everyone can step on the throat of his own pride and admit his mistakes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/567/9ad/7af/5679ad7af02945908dc178d287131529.JPG"><br><br><br>  Here comes the fun story from the return marketing guru.  The guys hired an actor in the form of a messenger from the time of Peter the Great.  He went to the offices and rant: ‚ÄúMa'am Ivanova works here?  Madam Ivanova, a letter of repentance to you. ‚ÄùAfter she received the letter, there was no way to deny the company for forgiveness, the client returned successfully. <br><br>  After the speech of Igor Mann, the conference organizers scheduled a debate with him and another guru of domestic marketing Ilya Balakhnin.  While Illya was godlessly late, Mann entertained the audience as much as he could, joked a lot, told stories from his personal life. <br><br>  And Ilya arrived in time.  The debate was supposed to push the heads of two representatives of various marketing schools.  Igor Mann represented the classic school of offline marketing, Ilya - new trends in digital marketing.  The debates promised to be hot, the organizers even called on a guard for fun, and put him between his opponents.  This photo from instagram will say the most eloquently from this: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/30d/e55/e76/30de55e763f345fbb6b0bb73f8ba9eb4.JPG"><br><br><br>  This was not the first Digitale conference I attended.  But this is the first Digitale, after which I will recommend to my colleagues to go to the next one. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/244637/">https://habr.com/ru/post/244637/</a></p>
