The crossbow will show itself perfectly in all weather conditions, be it rain or snow (however, if you decide to use it, say, at a temperature of minus 50 degrees, make sure that you attach a device to work in these conditions to it, otherwise you can get the case and fall off spare parts underfoot after an attempt to shoot). <br><br>  Initially, this type of crossbow supports a huge number of animals, mammals and other amphibious creatures, however, the crossbow can be mistaken when trying to shoot a brown bear, when a crossbow believes that this bear is white, you can get a shot in the leg. <br>  Be careful when selecting the ammunition for this crossbow - poorly prepared crossbow shoots in the leg! <br><br>  To use this crossbow, you will need two hands (however, if you possess the secret octopus skill, you can do it with one hand): one hand grips the control trigger and the other sets the direction of the arrow‚Äôs flight (the wrong button can lead to a shot not into the bear but into the stomach ).  Also, an incorrectly pressed control trigger can send an arrow not at a sacrifice in sight, but at the stump behind it, and the crossbow will be sure that you wanted this.

      Be alert with an unconfigured crossbow!  As a result of the inept handling of a new crossbow, you can get not a shot but a fallen off aunts and an explanatory note dropped out of it saying that your actions do not follow the generally accepted rules for using a crossbow. <br>  Carefully set shooting modes to a certain animal, if you say you set the ‚Äúrabbit‚Äù mode and you have a wild boar - a crossbow can behave in a strange way and instead of an arrow release a trigger, shelf, bow or (in the worst case) instead of an arrow you fly ... <br><br>  Contrary to popular myths, to use this crossbow you don‚Äôt have to be a genius or a student who has learned the mystery of "brackets" - the crossbow has excellent documentation on use that covers all aspects of setting, using, charging, recharging, recharging, spinning, unscrewing hooking, changing the characteristics of the hook, changing the depth of the box, changing the tension of the string, changing the winding, replacing the spring, and so on ... <br>  In skillful bows, a crossbow can shoot around the corner after 5 meters with a rebound from nearby stumps when falling into a deer that stands behind a beaver on a dam ... but God forbid you decide that you set up the perfect crossbow!  Evolution does not stand still, and animals adapt to new conditions. A crossbow tuned to ‚Äúold‚Äù animals can shoot not a hare but into your hand, leg, stomach. <br><br>  The positive aspects of this type of crossbows include: high accuracy of firing, range, high adaptability to different conditions and different "victims". <br>  Disadvantages: in spite of the fact that the crossbow fires in any conditions, it works best in its native jungle latitudes.  The crossbow is quite heavy and along with bolts for hares you will be offered: arrows on beavers, bowstrings on bears, range and displacement switches, which are relative to the planet‚Äôs latitude and longitude, magnetic boom controllers with metal tips relative to the earth‚Äôs magnetic field, brackets, mobile phone, mailbox , a torch for cooking in difficult conditions, 10 volumes of instruction in 50 languages, a coffee maker, a butterfly, a universal key for the analysis of the crossbow and much more ... <br>  We recommend this type of crossbows for experienced hunters willing to spend an hour or two to study instructions, desperate enthusiasts or for those who lack the ‚Äúflexibility‚Äù of other types of crossbows. <br><br><h4>  textmate </h4><br>  Crossbow slings just to the right.  If you want to shoot straight - you will have to stand sideways, otherwise you can get a shot in the leg. <br><br>  This type of crossbows does not work in all areas of our planet, mainly in places with high density of cacti and sand. <br>  In addition, the crossbow is not collapsible and if you want to disassemble it and see what's inside, the sheriff will quickly grab you behind the bars. <br><br>  Capacity building for a crossbow is done by screwing different bolts, screws, threads and other vital things onto the crossbow body. <br>  However, do not rush to write off this type: immediately after buying from the store, it is set up for a huge number of ‚Äúvictims‚Äù and accurately determines the type, weight, size, grade, subclass of your prey.  It shoots quickly, it hits unmistakably (do not forget that it shoots only to the right) will recharge instantly, you can shoot with one hand (however, the rate of fire is lost). <br><br>  It has good ergonomics, is attractive in appearance (females can be attracted), it can be used even by novices in the hunt (however there is a chance to get in the foot not only for themselves but also for the female). <br>  This type of crossbow can be set with a quiver for 50 charges which it quickly processes and puts into operation, however, if you are distracted by some other matter (other than firing), the crossbow can block the trigger and think about life for a while ... such moments we recommend that you relax and have a cup of tea. <br><br>  The advantages of this type of crossbows include: ease of use for beginners, support ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù of many types of arrows, ‚Äúvictims‚Äù, high extensibility and support for hunters from all over the world (don't forget about the attractive look! You bought this crossbow? <br>  The disadvantages include: the monolithic structure, the impossibility of promotion, some problematic modes of operation (it will be difficult to dig with this crossbow, but it is possible). <br>  We recommend this crossbow for beginning hunters and hunters who have decided on the place of hunting for a long period of stay. <br><br><h4>  vim </h4><br>  This type of crossbows is suitable for people who can perform only one action in a certain period of time.  With this crossbow, you can either shoot, walk, or charge it.  And if you run and the beast is chasing you, you will not be able to shoot at it - the crossbow will block the trigger (at best, at worst it will shoot your leg). <br><br>  This type of crossbows, like emacs, works on different planes of our planet and can be configured for different actions when you click on different elements of a crossbow (let's say you pull the trigger and stroke the auntie - it beeps and fires an arrow with a burning tip), but in the hands of a beginner This crossbow can be a weapon of mass murder (inattention to crossbow modes leads to fatal consequences). <br><br>  Popularization of this type of crossbow is scattered around the planet - you can literally stumble over it while walking on savanna or find it in a sewer hatch in the nearest basement.  What is the most pleasant - it will work!  but only with standard arrows and some amendments to the design (it is quite possible that the hammers may not be in ‚Äútheir‚Äù place and pressed in another direction). <br><br>  We recommend this type of crossbows to chess players, checkers or keyboard cowboys who can switch the shooting mode on the crossbow in no time.  Clicking on a sequence of 4-5 hammers, charging an arrow, adjusting the altitude of the flight may seem strange and repulsive to you, but don‚Äôt be in a hurry to write off this crossbow!  - years of training and you can shoot not only arrows but also stones, mud, slime and even plasma! <br><br>  The advantages of these arabaletov include: the spread on the planet (you can accidentally find it even in your barn!), A high level of customizability for yourself - do not like the 4 hooks to the left?  adjust them from below or from the side, you can attach them to the exit panel where instead of the triggers there will be arrow launch buttons ... A huge army of adherents of these types of crossbows has already done a lot for you, let's say, to add a quiver of arrows, you just need to put it on the crossbow and adjust the triggers - all ! <br>  The disadvantages are: difficult mastering for a novice hunter (you don‚Äôt immediately get used to the fact that you don‚Äôt need to carry it in your hands but on the neck, the hammers are not pressed back and left, and so on), shooting and walking modes can confuse you at first and instead of a shot you jump on a palm tree (or birch). <br><br><h4>  notepad ++ </h4><br>  In fact, he is not a crossbow.  Notepad ++ is a bow with a bolted, with the help of a scotch, a bed to it.  Some privezhentsy this type of weapon claim that this is a real crossbow, but we do not believe it.  This type of weapon supports about a dozen arrows, can create several firing slots at once, and can have several aunts.  With him you can hunt 90% of the land of our land, but there are such corners of the planet in which he not only doesn‚Äôt bum - doesn‚Äôt meet.  Made this weapon with the use of mahogany, with the result that supporting it and repairing it can create problems. <br><br>  I used to know one notepad ++ master who claimed that this was not a regular bow (sorry, ‚Äúcrossbow‚Äù), but a real launcher for arrows worse than the well-known Katyusha, but we don‚Äôt believe it either. <br><br>  Despite the fact that this type of weapon can be disassembled and look inside, you can shoot from it only from the windows, loopholes (in extreme cases, you will have to cut a square hole in the cardboard and portray the window).  Sometimes this weapon can be strange and shoot in the foot, this does not happen often, but it happens (and then don‚Äôt say that I didn‚Äôt warn you!). <br><br>  We recommend this type of weapon to campers and people who are afraid of open spaces (it shoots only from a window leaf - do not forget!) <br><br>  The advantages include: ease of construction, the ability to peel off an alien bed and shoot a bow, work with many arrows right out of the box. <br>  The disadvantages: everything else! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/86739/">https://habr.com/ru/post/86739/</a></p>
