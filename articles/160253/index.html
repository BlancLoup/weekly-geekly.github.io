  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Loading consciousness or accelerated learning</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How much time does a person spend in his life on learning, on the process of acquiring new knowledge?  At the same time, I mean any knowledge, whether it is the acquired instinct of self-preservation from the burn of a boiling pot, or just the whole lesson in school geometry.  At the same time, most of the knowledge is absorbed by practical mistakes. <br>  In this article I would like to share a way to manage the human mind, comparing it with the process of developing software for the PC.  At the same time, the whole article as a whole bears in itself only theoretical assumptions with a greater share of fiction, and does not pretend to be any assertions or facts. <br><br><h4>  Introduction </h4><br>  One can imagine that human knowledge is algorithms, they are only stored as thoughtforms in the human brain.  Every day, a person learns something new for himself, receiving information from the outside thanks to all his senses.  In particular, IT-Schnick is most used for this eye.  Let's try to conduct a study of the acquisition of new knowledge: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Stage 1. Reading information </h5>  Everything that is information (books, magazines, conversations in the next room) remains so, it is not an algorithm for our brain.  But as it comes to us, our brain records it in a temporary memory. <br><br><h5>  Stage 2. Data analysis and algorithm construction </h5>  After reading the source data, we turn on our internal analyzer, which, on the basis of this theory, tries to build an algorithm, given the consistency of the existing algorithms. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <h5>  Stage 3. Compile </h5>  Now having a designed algorithm, a person generates in the subconscious a sequence of actions of the new algorithm and works out the knowledge gained in practice. <br><br><h5>  Stage 4. Testing and debugging </h5>  Usually it turns out that when building an algorithm, we take into account not all the conditions for its correct implementation.  For example, a person sits for the first time behind the wheel, who was given all the necessary theory for half an hour how to make the car go on the road.  Indeed, the information is up to the details: <br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúSqueeze the clutch pedal, turn on the first speed, gently release the clutch pedal to the middle and give a pause, while it is important to catch the torque of the engine with the wheels.  For peace of mind, so that the engine does not stall, we slightly press on the gas pedal, gaining 1500-2000 thousand revolutions, and just at the moment of the engine clutch with the wheels we feel how the car starts to move.  Give a couple of seconds to start the movement, gently release the clutch pedal and move the left foot to the side. ‚Äù </blockquote><br>  But, unaware of the earlier sensations from the controls of the car, the correct projection of the driving dynamics and the calculation of the distances between the cars, taking into account the speed, direction, various unexpected interference, and all this looking in the rear-view mirrors, we initially create the wrong algorithm control machine.  However, during study, the machine will repeatedly stall.  And now, after a few hours of practice behind the wheel, we already have a more or less debugged thought center. <br><br><h5>  Stage 5. Maintenance </h5>  After leaving the driving school, we already have version 1.0.0 of the machine control program, but with subsequent experience we will grind up the skill, rethink something, supplement it, generally make release versions 1.2, 1.5, 2.0, etc. <br>  And what can I say, there are those who have a program for driving a car such as IE6 was developed at one time, and there are those who paid enough attention to the quality of their driving. <br><br>  Quite a lot it turned out to compare our knowledge with software development, but then more.  In software development, thanks to the fact that people began to create workpieces from a set of previously prepared functionality that was already debugged up and down, there is no need to waste time on developing a ‚Äúbicycle‚Äù.  In the world of human thoughts, such an approach is still lacking, and as a result, everyone needs to invent his own individual ‚Äúbicycle‚Äù again and again. <br><br><h4>  Optimizing the learning process </h4><br>  What helps us accelerate learning?  These are specially prepared teaching materials, slides, videos, and eventually live teachers.  What to say about the latter, so those in secondary schools are very poorly performing their role (of course, not without exceptions).  But, after all, the above listed one way or another applies ONLY to information, and still accepting it, we begin to design our own algorithm and compile it in our mind. <br><br>  If you imagine that humanity has found a way to read the thought forms of a person and record all the information on external media?  I‚Äôm not talking about the backup of the brain in whole or in part, and I don‚Äôt want to talk about how the neural grid works, here it is rather necessary to present an abstract unit of knowledge. <br>  Ultimately, scientists and engineers will invent a system of interaction with the human brain, and it will be so, for example, is the interface level in the TCP / IP model, and we will have to argue further at the application level.  Well, we considered compiled knowledge (knowledge, sharpened on the basis of repeated experience), and were able to download it to another person.  Moreover, the download does not occur during the week, month or year, but in just a few seconds. <br>  What happens after loading knowledge?  It turns out this way: a person has not done that before, he has just downloaded the knowledge, but he has experience and sensations.  What does it mean?  It will be about, like an athlete who stopped practicing, but after 5 years decided to resume training.  Of course, he cannot immediately reproduce everything he could in the past, since the body is physically incapable of doing this.  But the former athlete will be able to gain the knack much faster than a newcomer to this business. <br><br>  One has only to imagine how the wise men of the ages pass on their selected knowledge to the younger generation.  Educational organizations are working on the preparation of blanks from a variety of compiled knowledge, developing an increasingly progressive technique for introducing knowledge into the human brain.  After all, there are suggestions that the first implementation technique will work with inaccuracies (like any other technique), knowledge may not be partially transferred, and the source of the knowledge unit will differ from its copy.  You would think that schools will not be needed?  Most likely they will remain.  Maybe the training period will be cut in half.  But the progress will be tremendous!  For example, a pilot of a passenger plane with experience of 20 years passed on his knowledge to ten thousand others, and they, in their turn, will be able to land a plane when absolutely necessary, even if in life they are engaged in completely different things. <br><br><h5>  How can this turn commercially? </h5>  Looking at the example with the knowledge of the pilot, and taking to the comparison of knowledge of the multiplication table, we can conclude that the value of this knowledge is markedly different.  This means that some knowledge will be free (general education), but basically, any specialized knowledge will cost money, and not small. <br>  If you look at a couple of generations ahead with the use of such technologies, it is possible that a situation arises when employers in a resume ask you to indicate the source of your knowledge.  For example: <br><br>  Knowledge compiled by: <br><ul><li>  Company N </li><li>  Company Z <br>  ... <br></li><li>  Customized </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  I suppose that the implemented practical knowledge will be made from a person specialist in this field an order of magnitude lower, unlike those who developed knowledge themselves, individually.  And individuals may even begin to be in demand, as they will prevail in the minority, and secondly, patterned knowledge may not be of sufficient quality during the first N years from the beginning of the use of such technologies. <br>  It would be great if our descendants did not have to spend twenty years of their life on what we already managed to spend our twenty, and the ideal experience of one person was transmitted all over the world instantly, like a public Internet page. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/160253/">https://habr.com/ru/post/160253/</a></p>
