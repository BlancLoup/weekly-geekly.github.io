  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Kinoglaz - in your pocket. And then what?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Last week, Nokia introduced its new photoflagman <a href="http://www.nokia.com/ru-ru/phones/phone/lumia1020/">Lumia 1020</a> .  About a month ago, Samsung released the <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ru/s4-zoom/%3Fcid%3Dru_ppc_googleru%2520_s4zoomcontext003_20130625">Galaxy S4 Zoom</a> .  So, it can be said that these two companies are competing in the cameraphone segment.  There is really another potential competitor: Nikon.  Nikon has not yet released a camera phone itself, however, it has a <a href="http://www.nikonmarket.ru/index.php%3Fmn%3D2%26blk%3D1%26ctg%3D4%26tp%3Ddtl%26search%3DS800c%26id%3D1159%26stp%3Dprm">camera on Android</a> in its asset, which means it is a step away from releasing the device with a 3G module, and Nikon representatives have hinted at something like this. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Samsung‚Äôs developments in this area are straightforward.  Actually, Samsung does not represent any revolutionary developments.  All that, in fact, the Korean giant does is release cameras on Android.  The Galaxy Camera has a 3G module, but it won't work with this camera phone.  3G is used here only for the mobile Internet, which, of course, is also convenient.  The Galaxy S4 Zoom already provides full phone functionality, so, strictly speaking, the Galaxy S4 Zoom is the first full-featured camera phone from Samsung.

      However, another thing is more important: if Nokia took the path of space technology, supplying its camera phones (Nokia 808 PureView and Lumia 1020) with a 41MP matrix, which allows using the digital zoom also as an optical zoom, then Samsung, for the lack of such developments, simply attaches a photo soap box with a retractable lens to the screen of the smartphone.  As a result, Samsung's devices turn out slightly similar to mutants, but on Android, which means that Instagram fans can take high-quality pictures on a smartphone and upload them to a fancy hosting. <br><br>  The Nokia 808 PureView camera phone interface, which runs on Symbian, provides the ability to upload videos to YouTube and Facebook, and photos to Facebook, Twitter, and Flickr.  In fact, if Flickr had a normal, usable web interface, no instagram would be needed.  However, despite the fact that Flickr is certainly the most professional and powerful photo hosting service on the market (1TB for each user, uploading photos in the original resolution, downloading and other features), using it from the browser after the spring update has become very difficult.  That is, uploading photos without any problems, but displaying them in a browser is very inconvenient. <br><br>  In general, the web-interface and some elements of the Flickr functionality are for me, as for the active user, the Nokia 808 PureView is a separate sore subject, and, in my opinion, directly and directly connected with the amateur and semi-professional photo equipment market.  And therefore I will dwell on this topic in more detail. <br><br>  A few months ago there was a whole mess about the user agreement, which Instagram has updated, in fact, without the knowledge of users.  Say the management reserved the right to dispose of the user content contained in the resource at its discretion.  To be honest, the scandal from the very beginning seemed to me sucked out of my finger, because the resolution of the photos posted on Instagram does not allow them to be used for something more or less serious.  Another thing is the original images uploaded to Flickr.  I think some of my personal photos taken by me over the past six months in Georgia, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/revazrezo/sets/72157633705891022/">Svaneti</a> , for example, or in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/revazrezo/sets/72157633378133357/">Batumi</a> , may well be in demand by some paper magazine, on-board publication of some airline, for example.  I myself was a few years ago the editor of such a magazine and I know how sometimes there are not enough interesting photographs of various places in official photo banks. <br><br>  Flickr absolutely legally allows you to download photos in any resolution.  Of course, there is a copyright under each photo, that is, it is assumed that if someone needs a photo taken by me, he will write to me about it and offer to buy it from me.  But at the same time, he may simply download it, publish it, that is, commercially use it, and there will be only one chance out of a million that I find out about it, sue and force the publisher to pay me some kind of fee. <br><br>  At the same time, it is absolutely incomprehensible why Flickr will not introduce functionality that implies the sale of user content to interested parties.  The resource itself could receive a percentage from each transaction.  I think it would be quite a solid amount.  Thus, from the simple, albeit the coolest photo hosting site, Flickr would turn into a user photo bank. <br><br>  You ask, and where is the guarantee that users will upload their own author's content to their accounts?  Such a problem exists, but it is completely solvable.  For example, for those who want to sell their photos through Flickr, you can come up with a special registration form that an individual entrepreneur will make from a simple user, or even a legal entity.  As a result, a user who is hiding under this or that nickname will be transferred to the official, regulated by law status and in the case of using someone else's content, it will not be difficult to involve him in court. <br><br>  In general, the problem of monetization of user-generated content is, in my opinion, the most important problem of the further development of the digital photo-video technology industry.  In this sense, Instagram is absolutely adequate to the existing rules of the game.  Stylized filters of photos look cute on the Internet, but for such photos there is plenty of standard camera in 8Mp smartphones, well, a maximum of 13Mp.  But one or another photo taken on the Nokia 808 PureView, Lumia 1020, Samsung Galaxy Camera or Galaxy S4 Zoom, however, as well as full-fledged cameras, or semi-professional mirrorless, can be used for printing, digital content, designed for high-resolution displays , or even for a poster or billboard.  Moreover, in the case of smartphones that are always with you, any user can accidentally take this frame.  If users do not have the opportunity to somehow monetize their photo content created with the help of modern camera phones, these products will remain niche at best, and the segment will soon disappear. <br><br>  If we talk only about photography, it‚Äôs not a fact that the owners of the Nokia 808 PureView should change this latest Symbian device to the Lumia 1020. Yes, the Lumia 1020 has slightly different optics, a larger aperture, but the physical matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãslightly smaller.  And indeed, as a cameraphone, the Nokia 808 PureView is a great device.  For all the time I use the Nokia 808 PureView, personally, I have never had a situation in which I would lack the capabilities of this camera. <br><br>  Another thing is that in Lumia 1020 41Mp the sensor is combined with optical stabilization, which also affects photo-shooting, but especially when shooting video.  Lumia 920 has already shown a completely new level of smartphone video quality, which only five years ago was available only to semi-professional video cameras.  The Lumia 1020 implements a slightly different principle of optical stabilization than in the Lumia 920, however, it is certain that the result will be no worse.  In addition, while zooming was not available in the Lumia 920, then the Lumia 1020 had the option of 4x zooming without loss of quality with Full HD video.  The same possibility, only without optical stabilization was in the Nokia 808 PureView, but the video shot at 808 was much weaker in the picture than the Lumia 920 video, so for those who are interested in video shooting, it‚Äôs definitely worth paying attention to Lumia 1020. <br><br>  And here we are, on the one hand, moving on, and on the other, we are gradually returning to the topic of monetization of user-generated content, but this time in the field of video.  In my opinion, a very relevant topic, especially in the context of the recently adopted ‚Äúanti-piracy law‚Äù. <br><br>  It is obvious that already at the moment we have at least two types of completely watchable movie-video content: official, systemic cinema and the so-called amateur, or rather non-systemic, that is, films created outside the official filmmaking system.  It has long been obvious that a full-fledged film is quite realistic to shoot and mount at home, using DSLR cameras, almost any mirrorless cameras, usually shooting video in Full HD, and even 5-10 smart phone models and really very well shooting video .  That is, the technological base for a true revolution in the field of film and video is absolutely ready. <br><br>  Kinoglaz, as Dziga Vertov would most certainly say in this case, is in everyone‚Äôs pocket.  Video hosting Vimeo is full of very different, quite creative meaningful content.  Let there be almost no full-length feature films, but a lot of documentary, music, video art, animation, etc. All this video in Full HD resolution is quite suitable for projection on a 6: 2 meter screen, that is, a small screen, 50 or so, cinema halls . <br><br>  At the same time, in order to independently find truly interesting content on Vimeo, you need to set up your account subscriptions, constantly monitor updates and generally spend at least a few hours a day on the site.  This possibility is clearly not for everyone.  As a result, a separate profession of a person who professionally searches for interesting content in a given video hosting site is formed. <br><br>  Another thing is that, as in the case of Flickr, Vimeo, although it provides the ability to download a custom video, does not involve buying it directly for the purpose of further commercial public demonstration in small private film clubs, which I call <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/165829/">Media Caf√©</a> .  For film clubs, such shows could well become a kind of cultural program that would attract visitors to this club, and not to the next.  And for cinema-video lovers such a small film distribution could become an incentive for further authoring experiments, for which, naturally, more advanced devices will be required. <br><br>  In the absence of models for monetizing custom video content, the market for all kinds of cameras from DSLR to camera phones like Lumia 1020 sooner or later (rather sooner than late) stagnates and stalls.  In my opinion, it is manufacturers of various photo-video devices that should first of all be interested in creating models for monetizing custom photo and video content that will be the key to the demand for new samples of their products. <br><br>  Otherwise, for Facebook or Instagram, neither Lumia 1020, nor Galaxy S4 Zoom is needed.  Moreover, more sophisticated camera phones or DSLR cameras will not be needed.  Potentially all these devices are the means of production, but only units can recoup them, monetize the content created with their help.  And all these devices are massive.  In order for new models to become mass, the appearance of mass schemes for monetization of user-generated content is necessary.  Personally, it seems to me that this is a much more important problem facing both Nokia and Samsung, and Nikon and Canon, than the development and release of new camera phones. <br><br>  As for the notorious ‚Äúanti-piracy law‚Äù, then personally I don‚Äôt see anything terrible in it, moreover, in its own way (taking into account the above ideas) it is even positive, since it proclaims draconian measures in relation to pirated content.  But the content that the copyright holder through the Internet will be legally sold for commercial use, can no longer be called pirated.  And therefore, it seems to me that the adopted law rather clears the ground for the appearance of video sharing sites of a completely new formation.  I described the approximate outlines of such a video hosting service in my concept of the <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/revazrezo/ss-15992380">Franchise System of a Small Cinema Media Center</a> . <br><br>  Ps. <br>  I read the post and comments to him in the morning and wanted to add: I completely agree that all these mine (although not really mine, but Dzygi Vertov, but I‚Äôm only well absorbed in my youth) ideas seem controversial, but I also I am convinced that almost a hundred years ago, such ideas looked completely frankly nonsense.  Nevertheless, Vertov was right, one hundred percent right.  Similarly, forgive my indiscretion, I‚Äôm right with my own monetization of user-generated content, or rather the commercialization of non-professional, off-system content and the creation of an independent, self-sufficient market that most likely will turn modern visual media art into the Bolshoi Theater in the background hundreds of music and dance clubs.  Once again I apologize for the indiscreet comparison of his own person, but what I propose to do is with the photo, but especially with the video - akin to what Steve Jobs did to the music industry by encouraging record companies to sell songs through iTunes.  You will say that Jobs negotiated with music companies, and was not going to trade user content.  I agree, with only one amendment: the content, the rights holders of which were large companies, 30-40 years before this was the very thing that is not teenage amateur against the background of official musical art.  And now it's a classic.  So it will be with the movie.  At the expense of photos, to be honest, not sure.  In general, I think that with the development of mass digital photography, photography can exist only on paper.  What is printed, what can be hung on the wall, or put in a photo album, is a photograph, and on the Internet, only pictures.  In this regard, by the way, I think Instagram service would be in demand, allowing to order a photo album from selected photos.  Only your own?  And why? <br><br>  In general, you know what I say from the heart.  I have a friend whom I have persuaded many years to open a media cafe and show every video there, not a big movie, but modern digital author art, in which there are already as many genres as in music - and he tells me every time : Stop fooling around, nobody needs it all, neither movies nor videos, people just love to eat, at least those who go to clubs, and those who love movies, as a rule, have no money.  So, they will come to watch movies, and then they will sit and discuss this film for three hours at one teapot of tea, in which they will be asked to fill up with free boiling water.  And your media cafe is burning through.  Probably this friend of mine is right. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/186842/">https://habr.com/ru/post/186842/</a></p>
