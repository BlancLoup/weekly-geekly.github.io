  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Why does nothing change?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I want to thank the author of the topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/the_future_is_here/76737/">‚ÄúThere is no future or what stops progress‚Äù</a> for raising so much important topic!  She, to some extent, continues the following famous joke: <br><br>  <i>- Children, how many computers are there on the table?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Odie-in.</i>  <i>With difficulty, the teacher brings a second computer to the class.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Children, how many computers are there on the table?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Two-a.</i>  <i>Frustrated, the teacher drags a third computer into the classroom.</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Children, but now how many computers are there on the table?</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- Three and.</i>  <i>Wiping sweat from her forehead, the teacher whispers:</i> <i><br></i>  <i>- And yet, it was somehow easier with apples!</i> <br><br>  In a sense, as the author of the aforementioned topic correctly noted, the future is already here.  There are and constantly appear modern technologies that can significantly simplify and change our lives.  Money for them too.  Of course, there is no money for providing everyone with flying cars, as in the above-mentioned topic, but they are definitely more "mundane" things.  Why, then, nothing happens - nothing changes?

      How, tell me, nothing happens?  So much has appeared in recent years - Web 2.0, communicators are different, electronic readers and so on.  I use it all.  These things - qualitatively changed my life.  But come to your senses Khabrachelovek!  And look around, and preferably, not at your "advanced" friends and acquaintances.  It should be understood that people are different, and habical characters typical of clearly can not be called. <br><br>  An excellent illustration of the result of technical progress for ordinary people: <br><br><img src="http://www.38gadgets.ru/wp-content/uploads/2008/04/evolution.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Ordinary people confuse the browser with the operating system, and the neighbor granny did not hear about any Internet.  And this is happening in the city, now try to imagine what is happening in smaller administrative units.  But this is not even about individuals, but about the organizations that they form. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  There is such a thing as a habit.  Indeed, if you think about it, a large part of our life consists of a routine, which we, for the most part, do not even think about.  People, acting both alone and together, constantly repeat certain actions, as a result of which a certain pattern is formed in their head.  In fact, it is an excellent biological mechanism that allows to reduce uncertainty, that is, it allows simply ‚Äúnot to bathe‚Äù about many things.  We can say that the very routine of our life pushes us to what is called conservatism.  It is also clear why older people have more of it.  If we look in the direction of organizations, or, speaking more broadly, in the direction of social institutions, we will see that they are generally very conservative. <br><br>  Take, for example, a school.  Here, as fifty years ago, the children sat at their desks with notebooks and pens, so they sit.  Teachers, as they wrote in chalk on a blackboard, continue to do this.  Modern technologies have already reached the level that can allow a qualitative change in the educational process.  What is the matter - why does nothing change?  The point is not that the existing technologies are complex and dangerous, as the author of the above-mentioned topic believes.  The point is in the already established and stable collective practices enshrined in the brain of each particular individual.  People working in the field of education simply do not know how to use technology, and some, perhaps, do not even want and do not understand why something needs to be introduced and changed. <br><br>  Now imagine a man who cooked food on the fire all his life.  He was given a stove, but was not shown how to use it (or, at best, given instructions).  He suffered a little, and continued to kindle a fire.  Similarly, our teachers, having received modern technology, simply do not know what to do with it (for example, my school, with which the state allocated several million rubles and they were spent on interactive boards, subsequently safely removed to the warehouse).  And even if teachers know, for example, how to turn on a projector, they do not see the point in using it.  If, nevertheless, some people have ventured to use it, it can turn out even worse than without it, because not everyone knows that the projector is not only PowerPoint-style presentations, and even these presentations are far from being able to make up . <br><br>  <i>The problem of predicting the future lies in the fact that futurologists too often fall into technological determinism.</i>  <i>But you need to understand that technology does not define social order - by themselves they mean nothing.</i>  <i>What is important is how people use them, including in their daily practice.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/76750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/76750/</a></p>
