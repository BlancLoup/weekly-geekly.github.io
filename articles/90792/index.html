  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A little reflection on the topic "Significant and not significant things in our life on the example of Flash Platforms"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Hello, HabraUzer <br><br>  I am a flash developer.  I perfectly understand all the strengths of this platform and I am proud of them, and like any other flasher, I realize with regret that this platform is not perfect and there are many valid claims to it.  But this topic will be completely different. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Last time around Adobe and in particular flash, there is a lot of noise, very often empty.  Unfortunately, Habr is also no exception.  Yesterday, a couple of topics appeared, written explicitly by people with dubious knowledge about the Flash Platforms, and not only about it, but the posts themselves receive increased attention.  They have one theme.  Flash will soon die and burn to him in a fiery hyena.  Silverlight and HTML5 played the role of flash killers at different times, and now Steve Jobs himself took on the destruction of the flash.  And somehow about the ability in this direction, Silverlight, all somehow quickly forgotten.  But about HTML5 is still remembered.  Since I always find out about everything last, I want to once again return to the topic of killing a flash. <br><br>  So super HTML5, which will kill the flash with one click.  The whole question is when it will be.  As the wiki reports for HTML5 for the second year in development, when it appears it is not known.  How it will work under different browsers is also not known how quickly spread its big question.  Solid questions and not a single answer.  Yes, there are interesting examples, but this is not enough.  Together with HTML5, they also like to remember about fast Javascript, Canvas, WebGL and vector graphics.  Javascript is not a competitor of flash, in some places they intersect, but no more.  Javascript is still losing ActionScript in many ways, but it is actively developing, maybe someday it will also be ranked as a flash killer.  But not now.  At the moment I really like how it complements the flash.  WebGL?  Only recently the first draft specification was published.  As suggested by <a href="http://geektimes.ru/users/mono2k/" class="user_link">mono2k</a> , WebGL developers communicate full support in ff / safari / chrome somewhere in the fall and winter.  They promise it is good.  What happens in the end we'll see.  In the meantime, it is also not known when the mass distribution will occur, and I want to note that it has not yet been announced about IE support.  So it turns out that HTML5, we have a kind of mythical hero, about whom everyone has heard, told each other, but embellished, but no one saw him.  And everyone is waiting for when he will come and cut off all that can be cut off, fetid flush.  On the topic of killing a flash, it's much more interesting to me now to talk with Silverlight developers, but for others the time has not come yet.  As soon as he comes, then he will break the spears.  And now, sorry, talk about nothing.

      Next in line, but the first in scale tragedy is Steve Jobs.  As it is known not so long ago, Apple updated the developer agreement and banned all but a few particularly close to the emperor to write under iPhone.  And began a new attack flash apocalypse.  But the interesting question is why flash?  What other languages ‚Äã‚Äãdo not exist?  In fact, everything is simple.  Money.  Much money.  Awesome Lot Of Money.  What Adobe and Apple do is their personal business.  They row such money that neither of us ever dreamed of.  Seriously.  You can imagine a billion dollars.  That's how it is one billion dollars live.  The fact that these are ten numbers I already know, but how is it live?  But there are more than a dozen of such figures.  You can talk as much as you like about Adobe stumbling, declaring a compilation in CS5 for an iPhone, and how Apple did it, but you can't get away with money.  In these companies I work dear professionals with good knowledge of the market, I think they know what they are doing. <br>  So why exactly flash is considered the most affected in this skirmish.  The answer is very simple.  Because Adobe is cool.  Yes exactly.  Cool  How would you not want this and how would you resist this, but it really is.  This is not because I am a flasher, but, at least, because a flash costs 99% of machines connected to the Internet and has been standing for a long time.  And as if they did not say that he is buggy, inhibited, but he is in fact worth it.  On almost all cars.  Adobe occupy a huge niche in the Internet market for them working, or with them, as someone is more convenient, a huge army of developers.  And to kick at a crowdedly similar boulder is the best advertisement.  And Apple knows that.  That is why they are particularly focused on the alleged loss of Adobe.  It is interesting to know how much the IPhone and iPad's prades have increased after compiled claims.  I am sure that many flash-haters have bought or are going to buy themselves these things, just because of such an advertisement.  After all, Apple is so cool, they can send Adobe themselves.  (If, that I also want to buy an iPad, purely to show off).  That's just what the Adobe lost to me is not clear.  There are already a huge number of analogs for the IPhone, and soon there will be for the iPad.  But answer me the question.  Do you seriously think that the owners of iPhones and iPads, sit exclusively under them?  I think not, at best, they come home and sit down at their own, without the irony, the most excellent MacBooks or IMacs, or even a PC in general.  And there is a flash waiting for them.  So, how would Steve Jobs not boast of his products, are they all, part of the market, albeit a fast-growing one, but still a part.  Here is <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Flash_Platform/90620/">another</a> good article on Adobe VS Apple.  So in principle, nothing terrible from what Apple did not, no matter how he himself outplayed in the future. <br><br>  And why so many letters, strewing heads with ashes, and so on.  Yes, all because of the great attention to unnecessary things like those described above.  But things that are interesting and, quite possibly, significant for the market have remained little noticed by the public.  A small group, which is in the subject, once again discussed its ‚Äúpurely minor‚Äù news, which, judging by the reaction in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Flash_Platform/90738/">previous topic</a> on this topic, no one else cares. <br>  Namely, I want to remind you that a beta version of the <a href="http://realaxy.com/">Realaxy Actionscript Editor (RE)</a> casual editor will be presented at the <a href="http://creativefuture.ru/">Creative Future</a> conference in Moscow on April 23.  The developers themselves will represent it: Ivan Dembitsky and Yevgeny Potapenko.  People who are not familiar with the domestic flash community want to clarify that they are pioneers of a flash in runet.  These are people who, from personal experience, know what the developers want from the IDE and who use all their strength to achieve a result. <br>  Why, it is more important than the paragraphs written above.  Firstly, because they are domestic developers, what difference does it have to do with each developer personally in Runet, but still it is nice to read news about the achievements of their own, domestic ones.  Secondly, at their own peril and risk, they were engaged in a difficult task - first competing with a flush IDE, and in the future, as promised, to many others, and then doing not just good, but the best IDE, or vice versa, as for me, this is not important.  Yes, of course, it is difficult now to speak on the example of beta, that such statements as ‚Äúthe best‚Äù or at least just ‚Äúgood‚Äù have some justification.  But wait and see, and suddenly, and the truth will turn out, what they are planning.  And if they manage to implement all those declared things (Meta Programming System, Domain Specific Languages, Language Oriented Programming, etc.), then this will be a revolution in the world of editors.  In general, read the previous topic, the authors try to give detailed answers to the comments.  (about HTML5 it also says there). <br><br>  I want to wish them good luck in their not easy undertaking.  And also taking this opportunity, I want to say a huge thank you to Ivan, for the fact that ruFlash did not slip into bydlosrach. <br><br>  Finally, I would like to add.  Let's arrange srach in this topic, and comments on the case, we will write in the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/Flash_Platform/90738/">previous topic about Realaxy</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/90792/">https://habr.com/ru/post/90792/</a></p>
