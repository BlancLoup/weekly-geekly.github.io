  <section class="page js-page"><h1>How to become a Jedi email marketing: how many links to insert into letters?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  How will the number of links in the letter affect the effectiveness of email distribution?  Insert one link or a lot?  And how to find the "golden mean"?  These questions concern everyone when sending the next mailing letter.  It is difficult to predict how the subscriber will react to this or that letter and whether it will react at all! <br><br>  Every marketer can have their own opinion on this.  However, you can not argue with the facts.  That is why UniSender conducted its own <a href="http://lp.unisender.com/benchmark/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Drefferal%26utm_campaign%3Dbenchmark1">unique research in the CIS</a> market of email newsletters.  We analyzed data on 390,268,887 <b>letters</b> sent via UniSender in October 2014, and found answers to such questions: <br><br><ul><li>  How many times the average person is ready to click in the letter? </li><li>  How does the number of links affect the number of clicks to the site? </li><li>  How do people behave when receiving letters from companies in different industries? </li></ul><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now the letters of most online stores and company digests look something like the figure below: there are a lot of untargeted links (highlighted with red rectangles) that lead to the site, but do not bring them closer to the main goal of this letter - to offer a bonus and interest the client.

Since Internet marketing already has the widely used abbreviation CPC (CostPerClicks), we decided to replace it with p to avoid confusion. <br><br>  p (density of clicks) - the average of how many times a person has clicked in the letter. <br><br>  It is calculated as follows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e38/3c5/d8d/e383c5d8d9c444d3bd9560a2d69901e5.jpg"><br>  In this formula, we divide the number of transitions from the letter by the number of people who have passed.  We get a fractional number greater than one, which shows how many times our audience is ready to click on the links from the letter. <br><br>  Thus, the average density of transitions in October is <b>1.63.</b> <br><br>  That is, subscribers on average make <b>1-2 transitions from the letter</b> .  This is a normal human behavior - to perform one action in the letter.  Mailing can dispel attention to multiple links, and can lead to a single target action. <br><br><h4>  Now let's see how density depends on the number of links in the letter (unsubscribe link is not taken into account) </h4><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/260/a8d/765/260a8d7653bb4b5c81a7438d045a4724.jpg"><br>  We see that in letters where there are only two links, the average number of transitions from the letter is greater. <br><br>  It is necessary to take into account that the normal behavior of people is to click no more than two times in the letter.  Here is what can be done to improve the effectiveness of your letter: <br><ol><li>  The main target link that is visible in the ‚Äúfirst‚Äù screen (i.e., the one that can be seen immediately without scrolling the screen). </li><li>  Highlight your targeted action in the letter. </li><li>  Guide the person to the landing page from the letter.  For example, for a stock, this will be a page with promotional items and a description of conditions, and not just a catalog. </li><li>  Make a few duplicate links to the same page.  For example, online stores make a link to the product by clicking on the image, the link and the button. </li><li>  The main thing is to conduct a split test.  Check which of the letters is more effective: in one letter, insert only the call to the target action, and in the other ‚îÄ additional links. </li><li>  How does the number of links affect the number of unique links to the site? </li></ol><br><br>  In order to calculate this dependence, we took the number of links and the CTOR indicator. <br><br>  CTOR (Click-to-OpenRate) is the percentage of people who have opened the letter who have moved to the site.  It can be understood as ‚Äúinterest.‚Äù  CTOR is calculated as follows: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/244/03d/f3e/24403df3ecda443f9b4d90566e6d1046.jpg"><br>  Obviously, not all people who open your letter will follow the link.  Therefore, we are not comparing ClickRate, but CTOR (interest) - in order to get the results of the actions of only those people who opened the letter. <br><br>  We calculated the average CTOR for each of the letters with a different number of links. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b9c/2f8/09c/b9c2f809cb784e378ec471f68bf62186.jpg"><br>  From the graph it is clear that the more links, the more clicks the letter will provide the site. <br><br>  What these transitions will be is another question.  If you want to sell Christmas tree toys, and a man came to your site and bought baby trinkets, then is it good or bad? <br><br>  In this way: <br><br><ul><li>  If it is most important for you to get any sales from the site - increase the number of useful and necessary links in the letter. </li><li>  If it is important to sell a particular thing, service, or to notify about something - it is better to insert one or two links. </li></ul><br><br>  Next, look at <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd7/ff3/561/bd7ff356141f422098df53ab50650bfa.jpg"><br>  The graph shows that companies engaged in information sites and portals, as well as organizing exhibitions and events, have the highest conversion rates in letters.  Least of all transitions from banks and construction companies, which means that these categories need to carefully think through the strategy of their mailings. <br><br><h4>  Where can I subscribe to receive research? </h4><br><br>  UniSender sends more than 20 million emails every day.  Based on the statistics of these letters, we constantly analyze what is happening in email marketing in the CIS. <br>  You can access the study <a href="http://lp.unisender.com/benchmark/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Drefferal%26utm_campaign%3Dbenchmark1">on this page.</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364873/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364873/</a></p>
