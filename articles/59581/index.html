Long Island is Tesla's main laboratory, which he himself called the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0">Wardenclyffe</a> (it is not known exactly what was meant by this phrase, but the warden is the ‚Äúsuperintendent / warden‚Äù, and the clyffe may be an allegory of the English glyph ‚Äî glyph / sign). <br><br>  16 hectares of land located in the southern part of New York were purchased at the beginning of the last century, and already in 1903 the <a href="">first tower</a> had already grown on the territory of Long Island.  Nikola Tesla, by that time already an authoritative and well-known scientist, in her laboratory conducted the first research on the wireless transmission of information and current.  In fact, Wardencliffe is the heart of the great physicist's work, the station still has tons of equipment produced either by Tesla himself or in his drawings, Tesla's huge batteries without any documentation, recording by Nikola on unfinished experiments, and the rumors that the underground is hidden much more than visible on the surface.  In the end, with this very tower, which is a key point in understanding what Tesla was doing, there are several very interesting stories, on the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582">verge of mysticism and genius</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="http://cache.gawker.com/assets/images/gizmodo/2009/05/05tesla-500.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The stated price at which the agency puts up for sale this priceless piece of land: $ 1.6 million. For this money, the buyer, whoever he is, will receive ownership of the land with all the buildings and everything else that is in the territory.  And if you want - clean land.  What does this mean, I think everyone understands.

      Many, however, believe that the sale of "Vardencliffe" - not so bad.  In recent years, the territory has been completely desolate, and the land around the fence is filled with beer cans.  But Tesla fans disagree that such a significant piece of history will fall into the hands of just anyone, they are even against the museum in the laboratory - if Tesla had such a desire, then 16 acres of land could become a favorite place for visiting tourists even during the life of a scientist , the blessing on what to look there was always. <br><br>  It remains to be hoped that with such coverage of this transaction, there will be people willing to help those who have the desire with their finances.  It is possible that if the mayor of New York takes matters into their own hands, a training center will arise at Long Island.  Well, or another sports center with a beautiful view of the bay. <br><br>  "... The FBI conducted a search, seized all the papers related to the scientific activities of the physicist. It was stated that his records are purely philosophical and cannot be implemented ..." <br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/JxKKs5JHMdw%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh9wHmxjJtSoGhP9MQqWcpJZNq_XA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/science/05tesla.html%3Fpagewanted%3D2%26_r%3D1%26hp">NYT</a> via <a href="http://gizmodo.com/5241912/the-quest-to-save-nikola-teslas-craziest-most-impractical-projects-site">Gizmodo</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/59581/">https://habr.com/ru/post/59581/</a></p>
