      So, we invite everyone under the cat. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Even in this difficult year for all, the Solutions Forum gathered more than 770 participants.  Its sponsors are key technology <a href="https://contact.dell.com/Russia_partner">partners of the company</a> , including Intel and Microsoft.  Citrix, Nvidia, VMware, Compulink, IBS Platformix, Softline and CROC also participated in the conference and exhibition. <br><br>  The Moscow Forum is held as part of a series of events <a href="https://contact.dell.com/dellsolutionstour/">Dell Solutions Tour 2015</a> .  They cover 17 countries.  Speakers at the forum, and these are representatives of Dell, its partners and customers talk about market trends, innovations and new products of the company.  The goal of this event is to tell everyone about a wide range of Dell solutions that help enterprises not only optimize their existing infrastructure, but also prepare it for future growth and the needs of tomorrow.  Even the global marketing campaign launched by us this year was called Future Ready Enterprise, and the forum itself was held under the slogan "IT: a step into the future." <br><br><h2>  Future - today </h2><br>  In the movie ‚ÄúBack to the Future - 2‚Äù, the time machine takes the main character to October 21, 2015.  This distant future was presented to the creators of the picture by a rich high-tech devices and devices, which then could only dream of.  The reality of 2015, of course, is different from what it was seen by director Robert Zemeckis in 1985.  Flying cars and skateboards have not yet received such distribution.  But many modern technologies 30 years ago were even hard to imagine. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e73/8f9/526/e738f95269b258a0cdd9cd228909a3c2.png"><br><br>  The main areas that determine the present and future of IT are cloud computing technologies, systems for mobility of employees, means for protecting corporate data and user systems, technologies for working with Big Data (processing, analytics and storage).  So many industry experts and analysts say.  The <a href="https://contact.dell.com/Russia_Agenda">program of</a> this year‚Äôs <a href="https://contact.dell.com/Russia_Agenda">forum</a> was built around these topics. <br><br><h2>  Forum: Start </h2><br>  Traditionally, the Dell Solutions Forum was opened by Boris Shcherbakov, CEO of Dell in Russia, Kazakhstan and Central Asia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edd/70c/eae/edd70ceae2b443ce9701ad39b55180e4.jpeg"><br><br>  Two years ago, Dell, becoming a private company, had the opportunity to invest in the future - its head Michael Dell, who considered it necessary to ‚Äúbuild a business on the needs of customers‚Äù, ‚Äúturned the company over to the customer‚Äù. <br><br>  In 2007, Michael Dell returned to the post of CEO and began to transform the corporation, spending billions of dollars to buy more than 30 companies specializing in various areas - from networks and storage systems to software, security and clouds.  Dell has become more active in investing in research and development. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d55/b04/627/d55b046279da4f4e84c4c42c57c997f6.png"><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúToday we are witnessing unprecedented changes in the field of information technology: the concepts of cloud computing, Big data, mobility and security are changing our way of life, the functioning model of organizations and the picture of the world as a whole.  The Dell Solutions Forum is an excellent opportunity to talk about Dell and our technology partners' innovative solutions. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  A little bit about Dell‚Äôs recent successes: Gartner <a href="http://dell.cnews.ru/publication/item/54626">has included Dell</a> among the ‚Äúvisionaries‚Äù on the data center network infrastructure.  In addition, in 2014, Dell received more technology patents than in the entire history of its existence, and with its Wyse solutions, it came out on top in the global workplace virtualization market (VDI). <br><br>  The results of Dell in the development of IT solutions have become the first places in high-density solutions, iSCSI devices, server virtualization, support for the largest cloud services.  Dell software is currently used by 90% of Fortune 1000 companies. <br><br>  It would take a long time to list all the company's achievements, but they are in the annual report and appeal to customers ( <a href="https://powermore.dell.com/arc/">Dell 2015 Annual Report to Customers</a> ) - in pictures! <br><br>  Dell offers are designed for different degrees of "technological maturity" of customers, their readiness to introduce new technologies.  A differentiated approach to customers means that they are offered both traditional and new technologies, such as software-defined and cloud solutions, Big Data analytics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b95/901/d81/b95901d816534522b3836c36d697fab3.png"><br><br>  Boris Scherbakov considers open standards, compatibility and flexibility, modularity and scalability of systems, a wide range of offerings (from thin clients to servers, storage and software) and the availability of complex, convergent solutions designed to be the main factors driving the choice of Dell solutions by customers. . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/61f/9bd/687/61f9bd6872784087914a40e6bcfee04d.png"><br><br>  <i>"The Evolution of Information Technology: Dell's Strategy"</i> <br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/56266464&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhj7CXHickjJKCfouc0QuFlNoKqcpw" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br><h2>  In the future - together with partners </h2><br>  Key presentations at the forum were made by representatives of platinum sponsors of the forum - Mario Lindner, lead market development manager in the Eastern Europe and Russia region of Intel, and Pavel Betsis, president of Microsoft in Russia. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/36e/517/f8f/36e517f8f98d484093022dbe80737950.jpg"><br><br>  An Intel spokesperson spoke about the rapid development of computing and the evolution of IT.

VDI solutions pay off in about six years, in particular, due to energy savings of up to 50% or more.  ThinOS operating system for thin clients Dell Wyse occupies only 10 MB and requires minimal hardware resources.  For solving various problems of customers in building the VDI environment, Dell offers a wide selection of both hardware platforms and software. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2e9/3b2/ab5/2e93b2ab5c964c8eb5b6ddd119e188c5.png"><br><br>  An example of VDI implementation in Russia was the ‚Äúsuccess story‚Äù of the Center for Simulation and Personnel Training (CTS), one of the leading aerospace enterprises in the country, which developed a comprehensive workplace virtualization solution based on servers, storage systems, network equipment, Dell thin and zero clients. <br><br>  Vadim Yanyushkin, Deputy General Director for Technological Development of C &amp; A Center: <br>  ‚ÄúWe understood that VDI is an excellent choice.  We are a small team of specialists, we wanted to simplify administration and concentrate on the development of our systems for the training of astronauts. ‚Äù <br><br>  In the simulator, in particular, the process of docking of the Soyuz-TMA spacecraft with the ISS is being worked out. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5a8/30c/25e/5a830c25ec59457dacff639be15d5da0.png"><br><br>  No powerful graphics stations are required for such 3D modeling.  Visualization uses Wyse thin clients and NVIDIA K2 graphics cards on the server.  Software also runs on virtual machines on the server.  The simulation system is built on the basis of Dell PowerEdge servers, and NVIDIA GRID technology allows you to work with one graphics chip simultaneously for several users: the resources of the graphics processor are shared between several virtual machines.  TsTiPP plans to release a commercial version of such a system. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/298/021/1cb/2980211cb75d49d998aa9fea0417bcbe.png"><br><br>  Yevgeny Kim, director of IBS Platformix integrated solutions department, noted that Dell is becoming the largest player in the virtualization market in general and VDI in particular.  Dell's VDI solutions have such advantages as lower license costs compared to competitive solutions, cost optimization through the purchase from one vendor and support costs, a single virtual environment management platform.  All this ultimately affects the capital and operating expenses. <br><br>  Today, Dell is virtually the only provider of VDI ‚Äúfrom A to Z‚Äù, including servers, storage systems, desktop virtualization (Wyse vWorkplace), infrastructure monitoring and management (Dell Foglight), workplace equipment (Dell Wyse), and server virtualization (VMware ). <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúProfitable Wyse vWorkspace - Dell Comprehensive VDI Solution‚Äù</i> <br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/56266487&amp;xid=17259,1500004,15700022,15700186,15700190,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgS9p42VbjF43VBTE0fekGDoEwv7Q" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br><h2>  Service and support </h2><br>  Dell‚Äôs comprehensive offerings are complemented by <a href="http://dell.ru/services">services</a> that play an important role in the life cycle of an IT system.

After all, they form the future of the IT industry.  And today software-defined (Software Defined), or, as they are called, software-configurable solutions - networks (SDN), storage systems (SDS) and even entire data centers (SDDC) are widely discussed. <br><br><h2>  Software-defined storage </h2><br>  Software-defined storage, <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/dell/blog/265189/">TLC flash memory</a> and other trends that transform the landscape of data storage technologies were the topic of the panel discussion that ended the plenary session of the forum. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d32/f4e/a6e/d32f4ea6e4d24b6bbba363b723c58b21.jpg"><br><br>  As IDC polls show, in the world about 16% of customers are already investing in SDS and 36% are considering this possibility.  Russian companies are also showing interest in software-defined storage systems, but so far they are looking more closely at them and are trying to evaluate their benefits. <br><br>  Fyodor Pavlov, Dell storage technology consultant in Russia, Kazakhstan and Central Asia led the discussion, and Vitaly Tsybulsky, Head of Infrastructure Maintenance Department of the National Settlement Depository CJSC CJSC, Andrey Vulin, Head of IT Infrastructure Department of Moscow Credit Bank ‚Äù, Yuri Samokhvalov, Head of the Server Department of CJSC Svyaznoy Logistics, and Dmitry Yushkevichus, Head of the Infrastructure and Telecommunications Division, Clinic Management Group. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dd4/a98/98f/dd4a9898f42d449eb8a6ed65742a87ff.jpg"><br><br>  As participants of the discussion noted, the concept of SDS with the separation of software and hardware components of storage and using standard servers as a hardware platform has been known for a long time.  However, right now it has begun to be considered as a technology of the future that can radically change the market of data storage systems.  Progress in processor technologies, data storage technologies, the emergence of multi-layer solid-state flash memory, which is already approaching in terms of capacity and cost to hard disk drives ‚Äî all this makes us look at the storage system architecture of both vendors and customers in a new way. <br><br>  Almost all leading storage system manufacturers have already submitted their SDS solutions.  Customers expect SDS to reduce costs and simplify administration, but are currently not in a hurry to deploy SDS in a production environment, doubts are caused by insufficient maturity and reliability of solutions. <br><br>  Although, according to IDC analysts, already in 2016, the global market for SDS will reach $ 6 billion, the panelists believe that the actual implementation of software-defined storage systems will begin only in two or three years.  To do this, they should not yield to traditional solutions neither in functionality nor in reliability (for information is sometimes the most valuable asset of an enterprise).  And, at a minimum, they should exceed them in economic performance and ease of administration. <br><br>  Currently, Dell is deepening its partnership with suppliers of innovative SDS solutions, including Red Hat (Red Hat Storage Server based on Gluster, OpenStack and Ceph), Nexenta (NexentaStor), Microsoft (Storage Spaces), VMware (Virtual SAN and EVO: RAIL ), Nutanix (Nutanix Virtual Computing Platform).  All these solutions are installed and delivered on Dell-optimized servers. <br><br>  They target different market segments.  For example, the Nexenta NexentaStor task ‚Äî archiving files and content, Red Hat Inktank Ceph is used to deploy large-scale XaaS applications, the Nutanix Virtual Computing Platform is a hyperconvergence-independent solution for virtualization and medium-sized VDI infrastructure, Microsoft Storage Spaces is designed for software testing and development for Microsoft and hosting environments, VMware VSAN and EVO: RAIL - for testing and developing in a VMware environment and deploying a small-scale VDI. <br><br><h2>  SDS and non SDS: storage economics </h2><br>  In his presentation ‚ÄúNew data storage economy‚Äù in the session part of the forum, Fyodor Pavlov also touched on the topic of SDS.  He began with the shortcomings of modern storage systems.  Replacing them is difficult and time-consuming, expensive to upgrade. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúBy and large, the whole problem is that the storage system is still considered as a device, and a device with a limited service life, without any strategy of development and modernization.  Need a storage platform, not a device.  The approach to storage systems as a device leads to a ruinous storage model.  Modernization is sometimes impossible even in a single generation storage system.  The current financial model can be significantly improved by moving to a storage platform in which software and hardware are abstracted from each other. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br>  But can software-defined storage systems solve the problems of a traditional financial storage system model? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c26/973/02c/c2697302c72e4b71920cf1a9eb8a1e7f.png"><br><br>  Many customers dream of moving from specialized storage devices (applliance) to a pure software solution on standard hardware.  But the software vendor is asked: what hardware does it recommend for its software, has it been tested, is it provided with hardware platform support, can it integrate hardware and software?  The answer to these questions can only be appliance.  The circle closes. <br><br>  For reliable operation of the storage system, it is very important that all components of the storage system ‚Äî capacity, calculator, and logic ‚Äî are closely soldered to each other in a single device with a single support.  As a solution, Dell offers its own Compellent storage systems.  Their controllers are being upgraded - it is possible to move on to the next generations, moreover, ‚Äúon the go‚Äù and with the transfer of licenses.  It is possible to combine in one system shelves of different generations (FC, SAS6, SAS12), supports gradual data migration to new media.  It is not by chance that 95% of the Compellent storage systems ever sold are still under active service support. <br><br>  Such an economic model corresponds to software storage, software is purchased once, unified support is provided for software and hardware.  Moreover, data migration, even between data centers, does not require a virtualizer.
