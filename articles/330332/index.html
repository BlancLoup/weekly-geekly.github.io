  <section class="page js-page"><h1>15 best recipes for Smart Home with ioBroker</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>ioBroker is a designer with which you can build your Smart Home.</b> <br><br>  But after all, everyone needs something different, and each has different prerequisites and opportunities, a budget, available free time for planning and implementation, tastes and preferences.  An indifferent neighbor to the process of automation, but who appreciate the comfort, speed and design of elite devices is one thing, and the one who is passionate about automation and experiments is another. <br>  ioBroker is a versatile designer that allows you to implement the most crazy and incredible ideas in the field of Home Automation. <br>  For greater clarity, I will give you 15 of the best recipes from the ‚Äúcookbook‚Äù from ioBroker <br>  My favorite recipes, in which we are talking about communication between devices, when they freely communicate with each other, exchanging data and information about their current state, send each other commands, perform complex scenarios.  In general, we are talking about automation, which we know mainly from industrial production. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><ol><li>  Electric floor heating in the bathroom automatically turns on at 6 o'clock. </li><li>  Blinds on the windows read the information from the calendar about the time of sunrise and it is then opened, while the owner is still sleeping peacefully in bed. </li><li>  We wake up, get up, go along the corridor, the light automatically turns on.  At the same time, the motion sensor reports this information to the kettle and the coffee maker. </li><li>  The coffee maker turns on, or the kettle starts boiling water.  Turns on the music or TV, as well as a certain stage for lighting, which we ourselves have previously set up and called ‚ÄúGood morning‚Äù </li><li>  While we brush our teeth, brewed coffee, then, going into the kitchen, we will already have freshly brewed coffee or tea. </li><li>  In the bathroom, we ask Alexa or Siri about current weather, traffic jams, or gasoline prices, or stocks, or dictate to her the list of products, or ask her to find our lost mobile phone, tell a joke, make it self-destruct, offer recipes for dinner </li><li>  We ask Alekha to connect us via Skype with his mother.  About Alex will be a separate book. </li><li>  With the help of Alex, we can completely control the house with only one voice: turn on, turn off, turn off the light, open and close windows, turn on and off thermostats, music, etc.  This is very convenient if you are cooking and your hands are busy. </li><li>  When leaving the house, it is important to press one single button, and Smart Home will turn off the light everywhere, turn off the appliances, turn off the heating, turn off the music, turn on the TV and report that you forgot to close the windows or the inner door to the garden. </li><li>  Smart House will send a message with a photo to the telegram about who and what time left, came, rang the doorbell.  It is very convenient if a cleaning woman arrives, or a neighbor pour water on the flowers, watch the cat, children who have gone to school or have returned from school with a crowd of friends and are ready to smash the apartment. </li><li>  If someone forgot the key, you can remotely open the door.  If someone forgot to close the door, then Smart Home will definitely contact you or its neighbors to control the situation. </li><li>  Naturally, any house activity not foreseen by the regulations will be immediately communicated by the Smart House in a convenient way.  It can frighten a robber with a loud siren and bright red flashing lights, forcing him to leave the premises and call the police. </li><li>  When the family goes on vacation, the Smart House simulates the presence of a person in the house, so it is impossible for the robbers to understand that they are empty. </li><li>  You can watch your favorite flower in the pot from vacation, if you install a sensor there that will report on light, soil composition and humidity. </li><li>  Before going to bed, in an hour, all the lighting in the house diminishes and switches to the colors of the sunset so that the body adjusts itself to sleep.  Already lying in bed, you can ask Alex to set the alarm for 6 hours and turn off all the appliances in the house without getting out of bed. </li></ol></div>
