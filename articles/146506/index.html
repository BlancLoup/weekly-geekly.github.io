      It would seem, well, a man lost his voice - you never know what could happen.  However, according <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304441404577483051675022104.html">to</a> <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> , investors were seriously alarmed, which was also due to the fact that <i>Google</i> no longer reported anything on Page's problems.  The lack of detail has created a number of rumors on Wall Street that he may have a serious illness. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Page himself wrote a letter to the staff on Thursday that nothing was serious with him and that he would continue to lead the company. <br><br>  "We have no reason to believe that Larry is something serious, but we find it strange that the company has already excluded his participation in the conference about the 2nd quarter, until which, most likely, a few more weeks," wrote <i>JP</i> Stock Analyst <i>Morgan</i> Doug Anmouth in a note to customers.  He added that this may raise questions for investors. <br><br>  Anmouth also noted that Page, who regularly publishes links and notes on his page on <i>Google+</i> , has not written anything there since May 25.  By the way, yesterday, Page wrote the first message since: about <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/146360/">the Turing machine</a> on the <i>Google</i> homepage. <br><br>  <i>Susquehanna Financial Group</i> analyst Hermann Loing said that he started receiving calls from investors with questions about whether they should be worried.  ‚ÄúYes, perhaps a little,‚Äù he said.  ‚ÄúHopefully, <i>Google</i> will provide us with fresh data.‚Äù <br><br>  The anxiety was so strong that the <i>WSJ</i> even began to analyze Page's voice: he was usually a bit tense, squeaky and hoarse, and on the 20-minute recording of his speech last month in London, he heard that Page had stopped several times to swallow before continuing to speak. but, they say, it is unclear whether this is a symptom of his current problem. <br><br>  The <i>Google I / O</i> Developer Conference will be held from 27 to 29 June.  The conference on the financial indicators of the second quarter was not scheduled, but last year it was held on the second Thursday of the month, that is, this time it can be held on July 19. <br><br>  The expected absence of Page on two events of this magnitude will look "very unusual," experts say.  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs hard to imagine a <i>CEO</i> missing so many things if he doesn‚Äôt have a serious problem.‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/146506/">https://habr.com/ru/post/146506/</a></p>
