This is a powerful trend and today a huge amount of resources are trying to go in this direction.  There are also resources that completely build their concept on the basis of web semantics - for example, pusk.  ru.

      So why I do not believe in the semantics of the web?  I believe, but not always.  Even more I do not like it when people, in pursuit of general trends, cease to look at things sensibly and try to project generally accepted trends on ‚Äúeverything that moves‚Äù (as in that joke). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  For example, for business, for shopping, for porn directories - this approach is ideal.  You get what you want by spending the minimum amount of time.  The semantics of the web is ideal when we need information and tools for work.  The semantics web is great for achieving results. <br><br>  But the farther we move away from the required result and the more we approach such a concept as ‚Äúprocess,‚Äù the more it loses its value as a new general trend. <br><br>  Cool for which sphere?  For business, yes, it is possible to exchange recipes, for social networks - it is reasonable!  But there are areas where such an approach does not seem appropriate to me.  Unsuitable, due to the psychological characteristics of the user group and their motivation in relation to the portal. <br><br>  Especially, the concept of web semantics is not suitable for the entertainment industry, where there is no notion of result at all, and the only driving force of people is the process.  In addition, this process is unique for each individual type of entertainment, and therefore for each individual type of entertaining audience.  In order to keep the attention of the entertaining audience for a long time, it is necessary to understand and track the real needs of such a group very well, and not be guided by general trends. <br><br>  Why I do not believe in the semantics of the web in sports? <br><br>  In order to understand this you need to go to the stadium yourself: crowds of people, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãbeer, flags, shouts, fights, emotions, a sea of ‚Äã‚Äãcommunication and an all-consuming fraternity.  Try to apply the laws of the semantic web and in this situation.  ‚ÄúHow to do it‚Äù - you ask?  These are generally different entities - how can they be related? <br><br>  That's exactly why - I don't believe in the semantics of the web for sports!  Because, these concepts are not reducible.  The real life of the sport and the semantic web, designed for a completely different life reality and lifestyle, do not overlap. <br><br>  Now imagine that you did not come to the stadium, but to your own office.  The secretary gives you documents to sign, phone calls, mail, newspapers with analytics in your business area, a sports express with a standings table.  Recall the semantic web e. Aha!  I bet that here you are ready to bring together two concepts - the semantic web and business. <br><br>  Conclusion: for each area of ‚Äã‚Äãa person‚Äôs life there should be different trends and you, as the creator of a promising project, don‚Äôt have to be lazy and should study unique tendencies in your target audience, and not rush to implement other people's concepts invented by other people for other users with a different purpose. <br><br>  The popularity of the semantic web is due to the fact that this is the most convenient environment for us.  We are business people who do not want to listen to unnecessary chatter, but want to receive only the necessary information.  If we consider that we are the people who create the web, it is logical that we will strive to invest in the web those technologies that are closest to us and that we use every day.  But this is a mistake!  Your and my users - this is not necessary! <br><br>  Web emitation <br><br>  Web emits real life.  This does not mean that there are no tendencies in the web world and that it should fully obey the laws of human existence.  The Web itself has already become a way of life of a person and its sphere.  But we should not forget that, besides the web, there are still many motivations, desires and spheres of life in the life of the ‚Äúsocial young one‚Äù, and all of them should be taken into account if you really do not expect the global success of your portal. <br><br>  Any web trend, even the most obvious, is worth being very wary of.  And God forbid, if the basis of your site will be laid newfangled trends, and only then human psychology of the social group that you are going to spud.  Your project will reach a certain height, but just as quickly roll down with the advent of newer trends.  We can say that your project will not have a soul.  Trends and technologies can change, and the farther - the faster.  But these technologies should only frame the diamond, and not replace it.  People and their true motives are what should be the basis, and clothes, in the form of fashionable technologies, can be changed at any time. <br><br>  But forgetting that human interest may change over time is not worth it.  Powerful technological flows - can also change the basic psychology of your user.  Therefore, I urge that you study how trends are appropriate for your project.  If yes, then you need to use it, if not, and the emphasis on bias can overshadow the main idea or humanitarian basis of the project - throw it into the dustbin or make it a pleasant addition, but so that it does not interfere. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/44912/">https://habr.com/ru/post/44912/</a></p>
