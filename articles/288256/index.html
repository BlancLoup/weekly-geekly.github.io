  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Amy Webb: In 2012, the issues of data processing, mobile payments and identification will be particularly relevant</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <b>Editorial note:</b> We are completing 2011 with a survey of the most intelligent experts in the field of journalism.  Today we publish the forecast of <a href="http://www.niemanlab.org/author/awebb/">Amy Webb</a> , the head of the digital ideas and strategy agency of the Webbmedia Group, about what the leading technology trends will be in 2012. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  Processing large amounts of data </h5><br>  Information is everywhere, but in 2012 we will especially be puzzled by its processing.  We collect daily data about our activity using <a href="http://www.bodymedia.com/">BodyMedia bracelets</a> and synchronize biometrics data with our Android phone.  Journalist hackers convert huge amounts of data so that their colleagues can operate with numbers in their materials.  Hypercreative teams of designers like <a href="http://jess3.com/">JESS3</a> turn data into pictures that are understandable to the common man.  The amount of data on health care, government actions, locations, business, research and transport that can be analyzed is beyond description.  They can be studied and obtained an assessment of efficiency, rationality and productivity.  In 2012, we are waiting for the emergence of a number of initiatives that will help us solve the problem of processing and analyzing large amounts of data. <br><br><h5>  Object Recognition </h5><br>  <a href="http://oblong.com/">Oblong Industries</a> recently presented its spatial operating environment <a href="http://vimeo.com/2229299">G-speak</a> , which was the result of thirty years of research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and uses object recognition.  Perhaps you have already seen the results of Oblong in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259E%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B5_%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B5_(%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BC,_2002)">film ‚ÄúMinority Report‚Äù</a> .  G-speak combines ‚Äúgesture input / output, recombinant networking ( <a href="http://technoticles.com/2010/02/18/gestural-interfaces-from-minority-report/">recombinant networking</a> ) and the environment as a screen ( <a href="http://technoticles.com/2010/02/18/gestural-interfaces-from-minority-report/">real-world pixels</a> )‚Äù, merging a person and an interface together.  You may not buy G-speak in the living room in 2012, but just wait for the appearance of object recognition technology in mobile applications and devices.  High-quality sensors, improved cameras and an amazing database allow you to take a picture and instantly get information about the person sitting in front of you in the subway, the ingredients of your dish on a plate or even the designer who created your girlfriend's new shoes.

    <h5>  Graphical interfaces </h5><br>  In 2011, we saw a lot of new graphical interfaces.  The New York Times showed us its ‚Äúmagic mirror‚Äù using Microsoft Kinect for face recognition, and then turning into <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/05/new-york-times-magic-mirror-helps-you-get-dressed-puts-the-wa/">an assistant built into the</a> bathroom <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/05/new-york-times-magic-mirror-helps-you-get-dressed-puts-the-wa/">mirror</a> .  He can advise what shirt to wear, what kind of tie, look for something on the net, find out the weather forecast, read the mail, find out the dosage of medicines prescribed to you.  The Japanese tablet maker Wacom has released <a href="http://inkling.wacom.eu/%3Fru">Inkling</a> , which allows artists to use a special pen and clip with a sensor to paint on any surface.  Connect the sensor to the computer, and everything you draw can be imported to almost any graphics editor.  Next year we look forward to the emergence of new interactive surfaces and new tools for working with them. <br><br><h5>  Topical Filtering </h5><br>  Simple aggregation (even with the possibility of personal settings) <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/personal/65742/">no longer solves the problem of information overload</a> .  In 2010, <a href="http://flipboard.com/">Flipboard</a> and a new <a href="http://www.pulse.me/">Pulse</a> edition appeared, which are applications for more convenient visual selection of content.  And now we see how the systems of semantic selection and recommendations of content are embedded in websites and applications.  This field is played, for example, by <a href="http://www.scoop.it/">Scoop.it</a> , <a href="http://www.twylah.com/">Twylah</a> and <a href="http://storyful.com/">Storyful</a> .  At the end of 2011, Google launched the Currents thematic aggregator (at the time of its development, it had the name Propeller).  No matter how much the news agencies grumbled that the usual collection of topics does not bring any traffic or benefit to the readers, this new filtered form of content delivery has been incredibly successful.  Combining the efforts of people and companies has a striking effect on data structuring, and constantly updated collection of topics helps consumers make an informed choice in the general flow of information.  Wait for new types of thematic filtering in 2012, whatever name it may receive. <br><br><h5>  Privacy Preservation </h5><br>  Every day we post millions of photos to social networks, along with accompanying them with additional data about who is shown in the photo, where it was taken, and even what kind of equipment.  Together with the service markers in places of visit, which more and more reflect the physical movement in space of us and our satellites, smart search tools have appeared that easily reveal our real name, age and interests from a photo of a person taken from the phone.  While some advanced users have concerns about keeping their privacy a secret, young users of social networks are increasingly wanting to share everything with everyone.  Facebook continues to frequently update the terms of use of its services, but most users do not know what their personal information Facebook shares with the world.  Therefore, next year discussions on digital privacy will continue. <br><br><h5>  Women's issue </h5><br>  It may seem that men dominate the IT world, but many development projects, innovations and start-ups are led by smart, creative, rarely in sight, but very professionally working women.  Associations like <a href="http://www.ted.com/pages/tedxwomen/">TEDxWomen</a> and <a href="http://changetheratio.tumblr.com/">Change the Ratio</a> are focused on drawing attention to women's successes and pointing out existing gender inequality.  In 2012, we expect more women to receive funding, make presentations, give interviews to major media outlets, participate in the jury and be recognized for their contributions to technology and not only. <br><br><h5>  Ethical and digital content issues </h5><br>  In 2011, the largest technology and journalistic companies have repeatedly raised ethical issues.  Blogger Michael Arrington opened a venture capital fund with a capital of $ 20 million, which he plans to invest in companies that <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechCrunch">TechCrunch</a> writes about in his blog.  The <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> microblogging platform, especially popular in the fashion industry, was disgraced when it became known that the expenses of the 16 bloggers sent by it to cover Fashion Week were covered by the event organizers.  For coverage of private events Tumblr took from each brand for 350 thousand dollars.  For this, brands are guaranteed to receive <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259F%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582-%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582">product placement</a> in the posts of bloggers.  The series ‚ÄúWhat's Hot?‚Äù On CBSNews.com tweeted that Steve Jobs died long before it actually happened, and then elegantly apologized: <i>‚ÄúWe're sorry!</i>  <i>Information about the death of Steve Jobs is not confirmed.</i>  <i>We wish you health! ‚Äù</i> As the media landscape changes, editors, developers, marketers, vendors and content producers of all kinds need to critically evaluate their activities and discuss the appropriateness of certain measures.  In 2012, the main goal for them will be ... transparency? <br><br><h5>  Technology is the engine of revolution </h5><br>  The Arab Revolutions of 2011 were made possible by the presence of Facebook, Twitter, SMS and BlackBerry.  The ease of using social networks, coupled with widespread low-cost mobile devices, has given power to those who have never owned it at all.  Next year, thanks to the success of civilian movements in the Middle East, an increasing number of groups of citizens will use mobile phones and social networks to accelerate revolutionary processes around the world. <br><br><h5>  Watch / Social TV Platform </h5><br>  An increasing number of people are watching TV, while using any device - a mobile phone, tablet or laptop.  Last year, we saw an increase in video broadcasting, not limited to a set-top box.  <a href="http://flingo.tv/">Flingo</a> - a platform developed for two years by the Bittorrent team of developers - allows viewers to <i>‚Äúthrow‚Äù the</i> contents of their screens <i>to</i> each other.  <a href="http://getdenso.com/">Denso</a> is an iPhone / iPad / Android application that allows users to save content to their account, and then stream it to almost any device.  In 2012, we will see the mass distribution of the phenomenon of viewing, as well as the means and methods that make it possible, developed by independent developers, vendors, the media and political groups. <br><br><h5>  YouTube Network </h5><br>  At the end of 2011, YouTube updated not only its appearance, but also plans to make money.  According to the new idea, YouTube will broadcast individually customizable channels and other specially selected content.  Next year, expect YouTube to launch channels for gamers and programmers based on <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_TV">Google TV</a> .  TV set-top boxes with Internet access and a new approach to YouTube have a good potential to switch the attention of ordinary TV viewers to new forms of digital content delivery. <br><br><h5>  Election coverage </h5><br>  We are already witnessing the work of the largest broadcasters and media in preparation for the presidential campaign in 2012  Get ready to use your mobile device or laptop to check the fulfillment of election promises and the statements of candidates literally on the fly.  Synchronize with live broadcasts of major media companies covering elections.  Browsing using Facebook and Twitter will become ubiquitous. <br><br><h5>  Mobile scanning and text recognition </h5><br>  Many were shocked by ABBYY, having released in 2011 an <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/textgrabber-translator/id438475005%3Fmt%3D8">iPhone text recognition application for</a> only 99 cents.  Receiving the name "TextWorker" (in English TextGrabber), it allows you to take a photo snapshot, recognize the text on it, import it into a document, which can then be edited, copied and even translated.  Amazon already allows users to take a picture of any product and automatically check if it is being sold on their website.  In the coming months there will be new services for scanning and text recognition. <br><br><h5>  Context sensitive mobile apps </h5><br>  With the advent of Siri, applications for iOS 5 can now take into account a diverse context such as location, interests, intentions, schedules, friends, history, likes and other things that can be taken into account when preparing content and answering user questions.  Siri analyzes the natural speech, so the user can simply say in his phone: <i>"Find a table for dinner for four</i> . <i>"</i>  In response, Siri will determine the list of potentially suitable restaurants, offer to send an invitation to the other three friends based on the analysis of their calendar data, and reserve a table via the <a href="http://www.opentable.com/">OpenTable</a> service.  Although Siri has 40 years of research at <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2590%25D0%25B3%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BA%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE-%25D0%25B8%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC_%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B7%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25A8%25D0%2590">DARPA</a> and the work of several universities ( <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon</a> , <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford</a> ), we expect other similar applications to appear on the market in 2012. <br><br><h5>  Mobile payments </h5><br>  <a href="https://squareup.com/">Square</a> ‚Äî a white, square-shaped credit card reader connected to an iPhone ‚Äî is used by thousands of small businesses.  Their new service - <a href="https://squareup.com/cardcase">Card Case</a> - allows users to check in at the establishments using the phone, and then pay with a plastic card, while using the <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/square/id335393788%3Fmt%3D8">Square Register ipedo application</a> instead.  <a href="http://www.google.com/wallet/">Google Wallet</a> allows you to leave plastic cards at home and pay with your mobile device at a real box office.  Silicon Valley startup <a href="http://www.naratte.com/">Naratte is</a> developing Zoosh technology, which uses ultrasound to make payments, it works even on the simplest phones.  So in 2012 we are waiting for more mobile payments. <br><br><h5>  Establishing a digital identity </h5><br>  When Google launched its social network Plus, it got into the news in part because it required you to enter your real name and data when registering.  At that moment, Google argued that people behave more prudently when using their real name.  It even got to the point that Plus became known as a digital identification service.  Many are now wondering how and where Google will use these digital passports.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/07/13/how-a-new-police-tool-for-face-recognition-works/">the US police began using MORIS</a> , an application that takes a picture on an iPhone and allows a police officer to identify a person by the iris.  In Brazil, police try on glasses with biometric cameras that can scan 45,000 control points on their faces and make database requests in real time. <br>  Apple bought the Siri application for iPhone, which can recognize individual voices and display contextual information depending on the user.  In 2012, our fingerprints can start to matter no more than our eyes, faces, or logins. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288256/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288256/</a></p>
