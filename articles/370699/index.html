  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The course of the Ethereum coin: problems and prospects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the end of July, the course of many cryptocurrencies <a href="https://ru.investing.com/currencies/eth-usd">experienced a rather strong decline</a> .  But the majority, however, are only interested in two specific coins - Bitcoin and Ethereum.  And if the situation with the chock is covered by almost all technological media, then Ethereum is not written about so actively. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/eda/ad6/bcd/edaad6bcd050e9488879e07ad8df1191.jpg"><br><br>  July 26 course Ethereum reached its minimum value, and the next day began to grow up a bit.  Now the course of the ether fluctuates, sometimes rising to $ 240, sometimes dropping below $ 200.  So what happens at all? <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h3>  Hacking, ICO and Regulators </h3><br>  Ethereum had two major problems last month.  The first is a few high-profile cases of cryptocurrency theft when a number of companies enter the ICO.  In late July, the attackers managed to divert in the total amount of $ 34 million on the air (at the exchange rate at that time) from three companies.  These companies kept their funds in Parity's wallet, and to withdraw money, cybercriminals took advantage of a software vulnerability to change the owner of the wallet.  Everything turned out as well as possible (the burglars) and the money was withdrawn.  After that, the developer Parity released an update, but after the fight, as they say ...

        </script>
      <br>
      Among the affected companies are Aeternity, Edgeless and Swarm City.  This incident is very serious, for the entire history of the ether something like this happened only once, albeit on a larger scale.  Then, the DAO project was able to attract $ 160 million, of which more than $ 43 was withdrawn by unknown attackers.  Moreover, the method of derivation was quite tricky - it was not even a hack, but, say, the use of Ethereum implicit environment functions. <br><br>  Almost all the thefts were carried out during ICO - the primary collection of tokens by startups.  In one of the cases, ‚Äúhacking‚Äù was ridiculously simple - the attackers simply hacked the website of the company that collected the funds and replaced the official wallet with its own on the main page of this website. <br><br>  The second problem is that the US Securities and Exchange Commission has equated digital money, which is used during the ICO, with securities.  Until now, nothing like this has happened.  Now the US authorities are going to start regulating the cryptocurrency industry.  For the United States, I suppose, other states will catch up.  So far, regulation is limited by the fact that all organizations that want to hold an ICO will be forced to go through the registration procedure with the SEC (the same commission). <br><br>  Collectively, it hit all cryptocurrencies - and the hacking put additional pressure on Ethereum. <br><br><h3>  But otherwise, beautiful marquise ... </h3><br>  Actually, these two factors still hinder the difficulties of Aether, mainly.  And the rest of Ethereum all is well.  For example, in mid-July, 34 new companies joined the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance Alliance, three of which you know for sure: Mastercard, QIWI, and Cisco. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-0" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="887582799099830273"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  Now there are already 150 companies in the alliance.  Among the new arrivals are banks, startups, technology companies and many other types of organizations.  Also among the newcomers can be noted more Bloq, Cybersoft Digital Services Corp., iEx.ec, Lazarski University, OTP Bank Plc., Scotiabank, Technical University of Munich, Texcent Asia Pte Ltd, TIS R &amp; D Center.  Inc., TokenCard and other organizations. <br><br>  In addition, an increasing number of companies are beginning to use the broadcast as a means of payment.  Here news even comes from Russia: Alfa-Bank and S7 Airlines have <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/tehnologii/348559-banki-primenili-ethereum-nacionalnye-osobennosti-blokcheyna">launched a</a> special Ethereum-based platform for conducting trade operations: <br><br>  ‚ÄúWith the current settings, our network can perform more than 100 transactions per second.  Full payment cycle.  Including about 7 transactions, finalizing the blocks and making a payment in fiat currency now takes about 23 seconds, ‚Äùsaid Pavel Voronin, deputy general director for information technology at S7 Group. <br><br>  It should be noted here that in the case of Alfa-Bank and S7 Airlines <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/tehnologii/348559-banki-primenili-ethereum-nacionalnye-osobennosti-blokcheyna">, only the Ethereum software is used</a> , not the cryptocurrency itself, but still, this is positive news for the entire community. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/668/3d2/cb2/6683d2cb2c6328b96299ffe04739af80.jpg"><br><br>  And this is only a small fraction of Ethereum's success lately.  An increasing number of companies are entering this market, some countries recognize the broadcast as a means of payment.  Investors with tight wallets appear in this area, and this means that soon, after regulators from various countries regulate work with Ethereum, financial corporations, the largest companies in the IT sector, banks, etc. will enter the market.  And this means getting huge amounts of investment, which will positively affect the rate of Ethereum and other currencies.  The founder of the investment firm Standpoint Research Ronnie Moas <a href="https://t.co/f5iqlDPThi">believes</a> that within a year the price of Ethereum could double, to $ 400 per cryptonette. <br><br><div class="oembed"><twitter-widget class="twitter-tweet twitter-tweet-rendered" id="twitter-widget-1" style="position: static; visibility: visible; display: block; transform: rotate(0deg); width: 500px; margin: 10px auto; max-width: 100%; min-width: 220px;" data-tweet-id="892087592564531203"></twitter-widget><script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></div><br>  Of course, no one can guarantee a bright future - but some bad news is not able to reverse the powerful trend for the ascent of Ether, so from our point of view, its prospects look quite promising. <br><br>  <i>The demand for cloud mining of ether grows throughout the year:</i> <br> <a href="https://hashflare.io/%3Flang%3Drus%26utm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dpost%26utm_campaign%3D290647"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/845/d38/414/845d384142804855a56ac37352cdf31c.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370699/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370699/</a></p>
