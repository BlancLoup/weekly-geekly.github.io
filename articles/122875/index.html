PS3 code and algorithms, and in the future to abandon attempts to hack Sony products in exchange for the termination of the claim, in response to which GeoHot called for a boycott of the company's products. <br><br>  As it became known now, as early as next month after the trial, George Hotz was hired on Facebook.  Although so far no official statement has been received from the company (only the fact that Hotz was hired was confirmed), according to reports that come from different parts of the network, George has been working in the position of software engineer since May 9.  Nothing more is known about his activities in the company or his duties.

      An interesting fact is how GeoHot acquaintances discovered his new employer.  <a href="http://chronic-dev.org/blog/">The Chronic-Dev Team</a> (for those who don't know, this is a group of developers working on software for jailbreaking iOS devices), in particular its member Joshua Hill, let out that Hotz was invited to participate in the search for an exploit for iPad2 , however, the latter refused, citing "the current place of work", as well as "the desire to avoid the scene light after recent trials with Sony." <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After that, Gabe Riviera (Gabe Rivera) - the founder of the news aggregator <a href="http://techmeme.com/">Techmeme</a> , decided to get to the bottom of the truth and discovered that Hotz wrote on his Facebook profile wall that he, in fact, now works on Facebook.  According to his <a href="http://www.facebook.com/geohot%3Fsk%3Dwall">notes</a> (which is visible only to friends), he began working in May and only at the end of June shared this news with friends. <br><br><img src="http://rww.readwriteweb.netdna-cdn.com/geohot-facebook-account.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Guessing about the activities that GeoHot performs in a social network is unlikely to be necessary.  Most likely, it is connected with attempts of large-scale access of Facebook to the mobile market, especially it concerns the development of an application for iPad.  A week ago, The New York Times has already confirmed that the application has been in development for about a year, and it is quite possible that only a few weeks left before its release. <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/facebook_hires_famous_iphone_and_sony_hacker_geohot_george_hotz.php">ReadWriteWeb</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122875/</a></p>
