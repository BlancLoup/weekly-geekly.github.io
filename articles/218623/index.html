  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Web Monitoring: Why a low uptime website can pull your business to the bottom</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  This time we would like to give some advice on why the uptime of the web site is so important and how our <a href="http://www.host-tracker.com/">site availability monitoring service</a> helps to monitor it. <br><br>  Uptime for your website is like your health is for you: you don‚Äôt really value it until one day it disappears.  If you were a webmaster or an employee of a hosting company, you would not have the slightest doubt about why uptime is so important.  But have you thought about how low uptime affects your business? <br>  I think it would not be an exaggeration if I say that serious interruptions and long periods during which your website lies can literally ‚Äúput‚Äù your business along with you.  And even short-term downtime will result in immediate losses for your company. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h5>  Track uptime or risk missing sales </h5><br>  So you did all the hard work.  You have a team of talented web designers and copywriters who have created a great website for you.  You built more incoming links, like a real pro wielded social networking services, and finally broke through to the first page on Google. <br><br>  The client of your dreams is driving the keyword of your dreams into the search engine.  He clicks on such a tempting title of your page, because he simply cannot resist your short description.

      And your site takes and does not load.  He lies.  Sometimes selling your product is unimaginably difficult, but losing a buyer to spit at once.  And you lost one of those just a second ago.  For commercial websites with high revenue and high traffic, any interruptions and falls of the site mean an immediate and significant loss of sales. <br><br><h5>  Unavailable site - lost customers </h5><br>  One missed one customer transaction that looked to your site for the first time in your life is one thing.  But you also have regular customers who return to you again and again to use your services again and again.  If your site will be long enough or often enough, what do you think valuable customers will do? <br><br>  Absolutely true: just three clicks, and they are already making a deal with your competitors. <br><br>  And yes, how do you think, how often do customers return to the site that they once found disabled?  You will break the jackpot, if you guess the right answer - "never." <br><br><h5>  Falling server harms your reputation </h5><br>  If you are a hosting company, then in the modern online world, whose inhabitants are closely related to each other socially, your reputation can easily be spoiled much faster than you imagine.  An organization that earns the glory of a hosting provider that is not able to provide websites with normal hosting has not very bright prospects on the market. <br><br>  As for webmasters, especially those who work on commercial sites, their reputation as a result of frequent downtime literally shatters.  Imagine for a second that you are a customer who is just shopping at your site at this moment.  You enter strictly confidential financial information in order to pay, and then the site drops sharply. <br><br>  In addition to the annoyance caused by the fact that the checkout process will have to start all over again (which many, by the way, are simply too lazy to do), what effect do you think this will have on your reputation?  If you can‚Äôt keep your site running, how can clients entrust you with the security of their confidential financial data? <br><br><h5>  Low server uptime can negatively affect your search positions. </h5><br>  Low uptime of your resource leaves an unpleasant aftertaste not only among ‚Äúlive‚Äù site visitors.  Search engines are programmed to provide users with the highest quality links, so their algorithms do not favor sites that regularly lie.  Short periods of downtime are unlikely to affect your place in the search.  But if your site does not work when a search robot visits it, you run the risk of moving backwards in the search ranking. <br><br>  These problems can lead to the fact that you take a significant step back in terms of the success of your business.  So quickly open your eyes to the vital role of monitoring websites. <br><br>  To solve these problems, the <a href="http://www.host-tracker.com/">Host-tracker</a> web site monitoring service is intended, the main task of which is to promptly notify the client of problems with the site so that the client resolves these problems. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/218623/">https://habr.com/ru/post/218623/</a></p>
