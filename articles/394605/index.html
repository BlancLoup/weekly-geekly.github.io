Many of us use social networks only for work, others for work and for communication.  In general, everyone knows that all the information from the social network is stored somewhere, Facebook has a huge amount of such data, including private information of hundreds of millions of people (yes, there are already a billion or even more).

      Everyone voluntarily enters information about himself on the social network by adding notes, photos, videos.  All of this is a treasure trove for marketers, and the company has somehow been accused of ‚Äúdraining‚Äù these users to third-party companies.  Someone doesn‚Äôt care, and even now someone suspects a social network in using its information for certain purposes, often purely commercial ones.  Moreover, a number of users believe that Facebook has learned to analyze not only texts and images, but also voice data - in particular, the user's conversation on the phone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  This is a mobile social networking application that always requests a large number of permissions when installed on a smartphone or tablet.  Lecturer from the University of Southern California, Kelly Barnes (Kelli Burns) believes that Facebook <a href="http://news10.com/2016/05/24/is-facebook-eavesdropping-on-your-phone-conversations/">does use</a> user information.  ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that people realize how carefully Facebook tracks their every action on the web.  Everything that you do on the phone, all these actions are available for monitoring by Facebook, ‚Äùsays Kelly Barnes. <br><br>  Facebook <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/iphone-app/369513256545845">recognizes</a> that its algorithms analyze acoustic information that is accessible by the device‚Äôs microphone with a social network application installed. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/574/14d/9ad/57414d9ad9ea4f6a9cfa279794374690.png"><br><br>  Some users believe that the company has gone further, and it is already analyzing not only music and video, but also phone conversations.  The principle of operation of such a system is already described by such users.  In their opinion, the system keeps track of spoken trigger words, and if such a word appears in a conversation, the next stage begins - placing advertising information related to the topic of the conversation in the user's feed. <br><br>  Kelly Barnes has already checked this assumption, calling a friend, and uttering the following phrase: ‚ÄúI am very interested in African safari.  I'd love to drive one of those jeeps. ‚Äù <br><br>  After just 60 seconds, the Barnes feed on Facebook brought news of the safari.  As it turned out, it was a post posted by someone three hours ago.  Plus, on the page Barnes appeared and advertising with cars. <br><br>  A student at the same University of Southern California also conducted a similar test, with similar results. <br><br>  Naturally, the opinion of two people is not an indicator.  But the topic has been quite interesting for many users.  In the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item%3Fid%3D11767924">comments to the original news</a> , a verbal battle unfolded - some commentators say that all of this is true, others - no, this is a city legend, one of many.  Someone from the commentators, however, said that the NSA spy features were somehow considered a urban legend, so not everything is so simple. <br><br>  What do you think you are? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/394605/">https://habr.com/ru/post/394605/</a></p>
