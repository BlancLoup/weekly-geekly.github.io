  <section class="page js-page"><h1>"Goodline" writes off money for failed calls - tourists, be careful!</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  There is such a tourist sim card <a href="http://www.goodline.ru/">"Goodline"</a> , which operates in 169 countries.  Surely tourists know about it.  On it in many countries incoming free.  Outgoing is much cheaper than roaming with Russian opsocks.  So - my recent holiday in one of the faraway countries showed that Goodline writes off money just like that - for failed calls.  At the same time he increases the duration of calls.  How to check it and how to return the money, as well as other details: <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I threw $ 150 before the trip, I thought it would be enough.  On the site made a couple of outgoing calls with a total duration of 20 minutes maximum.  For reference, a minute outgoing where I was was worth $ 1.25. <br><br>  One fine evening I decided to call again and, oops, I only have 80 cents on my balance.  I frantically remembered all my conversations, looked in the history of the phone.  Well, I could not spend all $ 150.  Got into the Internet on their website to look at the bill details, good they have and it is free of charge online.

        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      And what I saw there - and I saw that, it turns out, I was actively talking on the phone all the time, though the calls all lasted for 20-30 seconds.  And written off for it as in a minute. <br><br>  But what is most interesting - one call lasted <strong>almost an hour</strong> .  They took, respectively, for this something in the region of $ 70.  This call was not.  In addition, talk an hour on the phone, where a minute is $ 1.25 - well, I do not even know ... I could not do that. <br><br>  For reference: Goodline's system is built in such a way that the request from you to the call first leaves, and then their Estonian partner automatically calls you back and connects you with the desired subscriber.  Type of callback. <br><br>  To call somewhere in the evening, you need to make more than one attempt.  Those.  I send a request for a call, I have a Wait for call on my phone screen - but in 90% of cases, that‚Äôs all.  connection does not occur (even the system does not call me back).  Or he calls back, but does not call the second subscriber - there is just silence on the handset. <br><br>  In the details, there was not a single familiar number, i.e.  there were the numbers I called.  But all these calls lasting 10-30 seconds - these are all those attempts that were not successful - the connection did not occur. <br><br>  It turns out that they charge you money regardless of whether there was a conversation.  Number dialed - pay.  And sometimes their system may not be disconnected at all at the time of the end of the conversation - your conversation is already completed, and they continue to write off money (this is exactly my type of ‚Äúconversation‚Äù for an hour). <br><br>  I contacted their support service, the operator, after listening to me carefully, asked me to report all those calls that were not there and promised to return the money.  At the same time, in his intonation, it was noticed that he did not deny that these conversations were not.  And indeed, for all the calls that I called - the money came back to me. <br><br>  It turns out that if the subscriber saw and called - the money will be returned, but did not see and did not call - your money goes to Goodline. <br><br>  Hence the warning to all Goodline subscribers - check the details after each trip.  If there was no conversation or it was longer than it was in reality, boldly demand money back. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/83755/">https://habr.com/ru/post/83755/</a></p>
