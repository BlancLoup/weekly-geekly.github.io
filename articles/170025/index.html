    <h4>  Prerequisites </h4><br>  Supporting periodically various interesting projects, I came to the conclusion that the donation systems I know are not effective.  And first of all, not because ‚Äúpeople are greedy,‚Äù but simply from a psychological point of view, donating is <b>not convenient</b> or <b>interesting</b> . <br><br>  You can describe the inconvenience for a long time, but it's easier to say what I would like. <br><br><ul><li>  I would like to see the results of donations.  Of course not a list of all who donated 5p.  right on the author's website, but some kind of indicator, something that makes the process more competitive. </li><li>  I would like to support projects not only on the Internet.  Even if someone painted benches in the park at his own expense - I would like to support him!  Why not? </li><li>  I would like the donations to the authors (/ musicians / artists / ...) - not to look like a ‚Äúhandout‚Äù.  So donations have a positive attitude. </li><li>  I would like to read a book (even a paper one) I could very easily donate to the author.  Without searching his site, translations, static commissions, pins, etc ... </li><li>  Finally, I would like to support many projects, but not to transfer money to everyone, but to approve a certain stable amount per month that I am willing to spend on supporting everything I‚Äôm interested in, and then only redistribute how much to transfer ... </li></ul><br>  These thoughts led me to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a ‚ÄúVoting and Support System‚Äù <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  The essence </h4><br>  <b>The essence of the system is simple - a person determines the amount of a monthly donation to all projects that are interesting to him, and then votes on any site connected to the system, and the amount of the payment is distributed in accordance with the estimated estimates.</b> <br><br>  Despite the simplicity - the system greatly changes the approach to donations.  Instead of making a relatively large one-time payment (and forgetting about the project for years), a person determines how much he does not mind spending a month on supporting everything he is interested in.  And then the "game" begins - he walks around the sites and puts "points", choosing what he wants to support. <br><br><h4>  What it looks like </h4><br><img align="right" src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/f80/f38/6b6/f80f386b60b75c6bc63b20887d31abc2.png">  On the project site (writer / musician / foundation / ...), the system looks something like Figure 1. <br><br>  When you hover the cursor, its appearance changes (Fig. 2), which allows you to vote on a 10-point scale. <br><br>  For example, a person determined the amount of a monthly donation of 100 rubles.  This means that he can vote using this system on any number of sites, and in a month, the system will write 100 p.  from the user's account, distribute them according to the votes put and transfer the corresponding amounts to the accounts of these people / organizations.  In this case, of course, it is not common estimates of these organizations that are used, but specific user estimates. <br><br>  <i>In fact, the system does not have the concept of ‚Äúbad rating‚Äù - even if the rating is 1 - this means that the site is in demand, although they donate to it and less than to other projects.</i>  <i>Therefore, the site rating is displayed simply by a certain number of stars, without specifying the upper limit of the rating.</i> <br><br>  At any time, the user can enter the personal account on the system website, view what donations are spent on, adjust ratings, delete some or all supported projects, change the total amount of donations, etc. <br><br>  Also in your account user configures the method of payment of donations.  This can be a personal account to which it periodically deposits money, or periodic debits from a card / account / electronic account, etc. <br><br><h4>  Benefits </h4><br>  I consider the main advantages of the system 2 things: <br><br><ol><li>  <b>Support from a one-time event becomes a constant movement.</b>  Check it for yourself: remember how much you donated in total for the last year?  Now think how much you would allocate per month to support all interesting projects?  Multiply this number by 12. Compare with the first. </li><li>  <b>Creating a positive image of donations.</b>  Today, donations are often associated with alms.  This service contains a voting system and turns donations into a financially supported vote.  Moreover, a high score is not just numbers, it is an expression of the author‚Äôs contribution to significant universal human values ‚Äã‚Äã... Instead of the sad ‚Äúdonate‚Äù button, we will receive the prestigious ‚Äúbadge of honor‚Äù. <br>  Imagine how you want fans of famous (and not so) writers to raise the rating of their idols?)) And let each drop a few rubles a month - but this is a steady income for years to come ... </li></ol><br>  However, these are not the only advantages of the system.  I can also note: <br><br><ol><li>  Easy to use for the end user.  Many users use a variety of paid services and it is common practice to recharge an account within a service, from which a certain amount for services is debited monthly.  This system works on the same principle, but allowing the user to independently change the amount of the monthly payment. </li><li>  Security.  The user uses payment details only when making a monthly payment, going to the payment page not from a third-party site but from bookmarks or from a letter with a notification.  Thus, the attacker can not steal the user's payment details, because  on his site, only voice points are assigned. </li><li>  The frequency of donations.  Having once voted for an interesting project or personality - the user provides a constant flow of funds (until the user removes the project from the list of supported ones).  Although the amount of the monthly payment may be small, and even divided into several projects according to the user's desire, but its periodic nature will make it possible to collect in the end a much larger amount than the usual approach. </li><li>  Versatility.  In the proposed system, the user can easily vote for dozens and hundreds of projects without experiencing any difficulties with translations, confirmations, payment notifications, etc. </li><li>  Using tags with QR codes will allow to transfer the system from the Internet to the real world. </li></ol><br><h4>  Donations using QR codes </h4><br>  It is planned to develop a mobile application for quick voting using QR codes printed on real products.  It is enough to point the camera of a smartphone with a running application onto such a label ‚Äî the application scans the code and during the next synchronization adds the project to the system.  (Instead of a QR code it is possible to use NFC tags). <br><br>  Many examples can be cited, such as printing a QR code in a book for a quick vote for the author and, as a result, support for writing a new book.  Or, for example, the organization puts benches on the streets and places such a QR code on them - thus obtaining finances for the continuation of activities ... <br><br>  If the system is sufficiently popular, a significant expansion of the market for free services sponsored through this system is possible.  Starting from animal shelters (a QR code can be printed on street advertisements) and ending with various circles and playgrounds. <br><br>  The system of printing such codes in a book, if it shows sufficient popularity, can be useful to both authors and publishers.  Authors receive additional income through the system, and publishers can somewhat reduce the fee of the author, and, accordingly, the cost of circulation.  At the same time, the authors, by attracting new donors, receive a long-term income sponsoring the creation of new works, in the long term, overlapping the fee reduction. <br><br>  The disadvantage of the approach is the low prevalence of smartphones in Russia with the function of recognition of QR codes or NFC, however there is a simple solution: the user photographs the tag with any cell phone and uploads the photo to the project site - the site recognizes and information about the owner is added to the list. <br><br><h4>  Organizational Donations </h4><br>  One form of donation can be organizational donations, when a certain organization or fund allocates a sum of donations, which is distributed among the employees of the organization.  This will allow the organization to allocate funds to support projects that are really interesting to society, and not to determine the list of recipients in a narrow circle of management. <br><br><h4>  System device </h4><br>  The proposed system for the mechanics of work is quite typical and comments on the implementation would be superfluous.  But you can emphasize a few unobvious moments. <br><br><ol><li>  The principle of goodwill underlying donations imposes certain features.  For example, the user at any time has the opportunity to change the amount of donations, or even completely freeze payments and withdraw money from the system.  And also change the list of supported projects, reassign estimates, add feedback about any project or system as a whole. </li><li>  For each supported project, the system should have a personal page where you can read about the project, see reviews, voting statistics, transfer amounts, etc. </li><li>  In determining the ratings it is logical to take into account only those votes that are currently bringing money to the project, this will limit the ‚Äúcheating‚Äù.  Therefore, all votes left by all users are stored in the system database.  Once a day, the system recalculates the votes and transfers the corresponding amounts to the virtual accounts of the projects.  If the transfer amount is less than 1 cop.  then the payment is transferred, but the user's voice is not counted. <br>  It is possible to implement a mechanism in which large donations have a greater ‚Äúweight‚Äù in calculating the rating, but its use is not critical. </li><li>  Each month, the user must receive an email with a detailed description of his donations, a list of supported projects and other information. </li><li>  It is also possible to indicate in the letter a list of projects most in need of support, moreover, if possible, taking into account the user's geography (to support projects in their region, and as a result, the opportunity to directly observe the consequences of support). </li></ol><br><h4>  Monetization of the project </h4><br>  Making a profit is based on charging an additional commission when withdrawing funds from the system. <br><br>  Since all mini-payments are made within the system, and directly bank payments are only payments to deposit money to the user's internal account (amount from $ 100 and above) and withdrawal of money by the authors (from $ 500 and above), the banks commission in this implementation is minimal.  Charging only at withdrawal creates an additional positive effect for ordinary users (contributors). <br><br>  <b>Anyone who is interested in the project - write.</b>  <b>I would be happy to discuss ideas.</b> <br><br>  <i>PS <b>And by the way</b> , there is one smart idea, which, I think, will become a new word in building OS interfaces.</i>  <i>I can‚Äôt tell more here, because</i>  <i>I have high hopes for it, but if you are an investor or a talented developer - write, discuss))</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/170025/">https://habr.com/ru/post/170025/</a></p>
