      Alexey Nashchekin answered the question about the certification of the Internet: ‚ÄúIf you want to communicate with friends, you can communicate anywhere, but if you want to solve serious problems, you must be a person and a citizen, not a troll and not a bot.  This applies to democratic processes, such as voting.  My personal position and the position of the company lies in the fact that a number of services clearly require the identification of a person.  Soon will be involved in the mechanism of the state.  This system is already used in public services.  A person needs only to register, and he can write any letter to officials with his own initiatives or questions, and every vote here is legally significant.  But identification is not censorship.  Censorship is technically impossible on the Internet, because it is a self-developing system.  Electronic democratization is impossible without identification and authentication.  What I see on the Internet as a father of two children is horror.  And this is considered the norm, freedom. ‚Äù <br><br>  Then the question arises: ‚ÄúCan a person‚Äôs profile on the web become his citizen‚Äôs passport?‚Äù <br><br>  Ekaterina Skorobogatova: ‚ÄúOne of the basic rules of Facebook is the only profile for each user.  We ask for real names.  We do this in order to create a truly social service.  On Facebook you can chat with friends you really know.  Otherwise, the idea fails.  When a person uses his login for other sites, the content may be changed so that in the future to be interesting to Facebook users.  In the end, our users can set trends, because there are already 845 million. ‚Äù <br><br>  What is the overall position of the Runet? <br><br>  Alexey Nashchekin: ‚ÄúIn general, we are 2-4 years behind.  This also applies to discount services, and online trading.  If you look at VKontakte, it becomes clear that Facebook just did not have time to reach the Russian Federation at the moment when Vkontakte made an analog.  But there are startups.  Here in Kazan, in a technopark, the guys cut and convert online mp3.  Million users!  Just no one figured it out.  There are a lot of such stories, the only trouble is that little is known about them.  We have both brains and potential, but if we talk about large projects, of course, we still have clones. ‚Äù <br><br>  What is missing? <br><br>  Alexey Nashchekin: ‚ÄúInvestments, access speeds, regional penetration.  Not enough in general.  We have a huge progress, but beyond the Urals everything is still bad.  However, if you look at the Rostelecom program, for example, it becomes clear that in the coming years, Internet connection will be established in these and other regions.  Mobile technologies have a slight competitive advantage.  They change the world in general and ours in particular.  If you look at the statistics, it becomes obvious that tablet communicators by 2013 will be the dominant means of accessing the Internet.  Everything will be mobile.  We are not lagging behind.  We have made a new version of the site in touch format.  Last year, Apple sold more iPads than HP sold on personal computers.  Soon everything will be mobile. ‚Äù <br><br>  Ekaterina Skorobogatova, meanwhile, answered the question of what is the ratio of people who sit on Facebook through mobile devices to the rest: ‚ÄúAll over the world we see how the proportion of those who use mobile access is steadily growing.  About 30 percent of users come to us from mobile devices. ‚Äù <br><br>  Victor Markelov, director of product and business development for VimpelCom: ‚ÄúWe see the future of Runet as mobile.  The growth of users using mobile devices to access the Internet is 25 percent.  In small towns, the penetration of fixed Internet is difficult, so many people use the mobile option ‚Äù. <br><br>  How expensive is it to become a user of mobile Internet?  For whom is this service for the middle class?  How much, for example, is the cheapest smartphone? <br><br>  Victor Markelov: ‚ÄúIt costs 2.5 thousand rubles.  Statistics show that tens of thousands of users use it.  As the smartphone becomes cheaper - and manufacturers are aimed precisely at lowering the prices of smartphones - the percentage of mobile Internet users will grow.  Everyone, including operators, understands that the future is mobile Internet.  The service will become increasingly available. ‚Äù <br><br>  Alexey was asked about the uneven spread of the Internet in the regions of Russia: what caused this inequality? <br><br>  Alexey Nashchekin: ‚ÄúThe point is financial support for citizens, because for many it is a significant part of their salary.  The availability of technological readiness of operators is also important here.  And they are guided by the solvency of the population.  No one will carry the Internet to the village of grandmothers.  That is, it is an interdependent process. ‚Äù <br><br>  Ilya Massuh, Deputy Minister of Communications and Mass Communications, added about the development of the Internet in the regions: ‚ÄúFor example, the project on placing cameras at polling stations at the March 4 elections was destined to become a technological sensation and an important technological platform.  In other countries, they were surprised and envied.  We got a decent platform and network.  At their expense, we have increased the capacity of the Runet by 1.5 times.  That is, the speed in the regions will definitely be higher.  The intuition of investing money by the state already justifies itself.  There were in fact places where the Internet before this project did not exist at all, at least about 15 such points can be counted.  For example, the route Chita - Khabarovsk: now about 2 million people have access to the World Wide Web. ‚Äù  There is no doubt that this is only the beginning. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/204/9b0/7af/2049b07af5c65f0c25d450db60b39972.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The Internet Forum, meanwhile, continues its work, and we continue to follow its most interesting and important sections. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/142396/">https://habr.com/ru/post/142396/</a></p>
