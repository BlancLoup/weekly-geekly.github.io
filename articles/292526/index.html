  <section class="page js-page"><h1>146% conversion or surest way to kill your traffic</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The question of the effectiveness of pop-ups remains open from the moment they appear.  There are many opinions on this topic, many articles have been written, many studies have been conducted ... and two main facts have been received.  First: Pop-ups annoy users.  Second: they work and increase profits.  We draw conclusions: the main task facing the owner of IM is to offer the visitor a useful pop-up, which: <br><br>  - Do not interfere with the perception of the information he needs; <br>  - Will help the user (to make a choice, to get the necessary information, to communicate with the manager, if he could not get through, etc.) <br><br>  Consider the first paragraph in more detail.  The main annoying factor of pop-ups is obsession.  The window that pops up, the user has barely entered the site, inappropriate pop-ups on each page, a disguised cross "close the window" and - attention!  - an excess of pop-ups from different manufacturers.  We will talk about them. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  According to reports provided by analytical companies RuwardTrack and Statdom, there are currently about 4,900,000 domains registered in runet, of which about 55, 6% are living sites.  Of these, approximately 40,000 are online stores.  And, according to analysts from J'son &amp; Partners Consulting, in 2016 the growth of the Russian e-commerce market will exceed 20%.  Some more statistics - about 60% of online stores use pop-ups, and the demand for this tool to increase sales is growing.  And, besides the obvious advantages, there are also minuses in this fact.

      Unfortunately, in the pursuit of increasing profits, some online stores abuse the amount - yes, it‚Äôs no secret, and quality too!  - contributing to this tool.  Today we want to talk about services that motivate visitors to a specific action ‚Äî to place an order, place a call, get information, etc., and their ‚Äúrivalry‚Äù. <br><br>  Such services as callbackhunter.com, hookmyvisit.ru, livetex.ru, leadhit.ru, crossss.ru, retailrocket.ru, flocktory.com and others, are certainly useful.  But, like any other, you need to use them correctly. <br><br>  One example of misuse is that the site is overloaded with pop-ups from different manufacturers, when they start to "fight" with each other, instead of converting your visitors. <br><br><h4>  Examples and implications </h4><br>  Look at the screenshot - here the consequences of the coincidence of the algorithm of the three services are clearly demonstrated.  The situation is typical: the online store used the services of several providers at once, ‚Äústuffed‚Äù the site with different types of pop-ups and did not set the correct settings. As a result, the visitor was attacked by three pop-up windows that overlapped each other and in fact blocked the page.  Search for ‚Äúclose‚Äù crosses and delete all pop-ups one by one or just leave the site - which process will take less time?  The answer is obvious. <br><br>  The end user of the services is not the site owner, but its visitor.  Who is willing to part with money in a comfortable environment.  Imagine that in the process of choosing a product or getting acquainted with any information on the site, you are ‚Äúattacked‚Äù at the same time by several pop-ups or popping out alternately on each page.  In 99% the reaction will be irritation.  And the more often a visitor encounters such situations, the higher the likelihood of his going to another resource.  Such anarchy works to the detriment and useful tools in this case turn into a dangerous weapon. <br><br>  With us, all client connections go through an account and before rolling out we examine the site for other services, and then send recommendations or suggestions to the client.  And sometimes they even refuse to connect, because  in such cases, reputation is more important than profit. <br><br><h4>  Solutions </h4><br>  To avoid unpleasant situations, you can install a code that blocks the display of your service. <br><br><h4>  Manual Processing Solution </h4><br><pre><code class="hljs lisp">if (<span class="hljs-name"><span class="hljs-name">document</span></span>.getElementById('wrap') <span class="hljs-symbol"><span class="hljs-symbol">&amp;&amp;</span></span> document.getElementById('wrap').className.indexOf('perezvoniWidget_blur') != <span class="hljs-number"><span class="hljs-number">-1</span></span>) return false<span class="hljs-comment"><span class="hljs-comment">;</span></span></code> </pre> <br>  This is an example of code that cancels impressions if there are active pop-ups of other people's services on the page (for example, the Leave your contacts pop-up window and we will call you back).  We set this code so that the client does not have to choose, and the visitor is as comfortable as possible. <br><br><h4>  Solutions for sites on automatic and mass registration </h4><br>  We conducted a small test: registered on callbackhunter.com, hookmyvisit.ru, livetex.ru and several other services.  We received a letter with gratitude and instructions - all about the same, with the code and support number.  And, of course, no cautions about the possible consequences of a collision with pop-ups of other services. <br><br>  We propose to supplement this letter with recommendations in this vein: ‚ÄúDear customer!  If you already use similar or similar to our tools, be careful!  Check the configuration algorithms or contact technical support to avoid situations that could damage your site. ‚Äù <br><br>  The client has the right to use the services of the largest possible number of services, but does not always think about the possibility of the opposite effect.  We believe that informing about this is one of the criteria for the professional approach of services providing such services. <br><br>  And one more recommendation for online stores that have installed such a useful tool as an online consultant.  On some sites, the Consultant's window pops up literally every 10 seconds, whereas one show is enough when you open the site or show at intervals, for example, 10 minutes.  There is also no need for an accompanying window sound.  All this can be set in the settings. <br>  Summary <br><br>  Today, there are many excellent solutions on the market for additional monetization and traffic conversion.  But their thoughtless use very often leads to negative results.  It is not enough to install a useful tool - you need to learn how to use it correctly, monitor the process and track the results.  And in any case, do not let the situation take its course.  In the meantime, more and more often the thought flashes: ‚ÄúShouldn‚Äôt the trade unions be connected? ..‚Äù </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/292526/">https://habr.com/ru/post/292526/</a></p>
