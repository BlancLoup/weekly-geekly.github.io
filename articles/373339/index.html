  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dental materials of a new generation prevent secondary caries or ‚ÄúEternal‚Äù fillings</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Scientists of NITU "MISiS" created a technique that can become the basis of a fundamentally new method of antibacterial therapy.  She has broad prospects for use in dentistry, oral and maxillofacial surgery, treatment of ENT diseases and other medical fields.  Created nanoparticles of oxides of iron, zinc, titanium and other metals in dental materials have a unique property - they work as antibiotics without side effects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/80b/bcd/535/80bbcd535821cae5bd81664da6967b6b.jpg" alt="image"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The basis of the proposed development is liquid colloid systems synthesized in NITU "MISiS" (ultrathin suspensions that do not precipitate), consisting of high-energy nanoparticles of iron, zinc, titanium and other metals, ranging in size from 1 to 3 nm. <br><br>  The main problems faced by dentists during the installation of fillings are the active formation of colonies of pathogenic bacteria at the junction of filling material and dentin (tooth tissue under the enamel) of the tooth, as well as the formation of microcracks and microcavities during technical shrinkage of the filling.  A phenomenon known to many patients - the filling drops out after a few years, and under it even more caries are detected than before the treatment.  Even with the observance of all technological procedures at the border of the seal, a micro gap is formed over time, where microorganisms actively proliferate.  A complicating factor is that the dentin of the tooth is a hydrophilic (water-wettable) material, and the filling, in contrast, consists of hydrophobic (water repellent) substances.

Such nano-additives allow imparting prolonged antiseptic properties to dental materials used in the preparation and installation of a seal.  The task of these materials is to ensure good adhesion (adhesion) of the filling material and the tissue of the tooth being restored.  The presence in their composition of colloidal particles of metals and metal oxides improves adhesion, significantly reduces the shrinkage of the seal during curing, and at the same time helps prevent the occurrence and reproduction of pathogenic microbes causing caries, and thus significantly delay or make the next visit to the dentist to replace the filling. <br><br>  In medicine today, there is an acute problem of finding fundamentally new drugs with high antibacterial activity that would reduce the resistance (resistance) of pathogenic microorganisms against natural and medicinal antibiotics.  ‚Äú <i>We assume that the mechanism of destruction of a microbial cell under the action of colloidal nanosystems created by us resembles the action of antibacterial enzymes of the class of hydrolases that destroy the walls of bacteria by hydrolysis.</i>  <i>Such enzymes in relatively high concentrations are found in the places of contact of the body with the environment - saliva, mucus of the nasopharynx and gastrointestinal tract, breast milk.</i>  <i>Their action leads to the process of lysis (destruction of cells into fragments) and the death of a pathogenic cell.</i>  <i>Apparently, metal oxide nanoparticles act as a catalyst for hydrolases, which ultimately leads to the destruction of the peptide and glycosidic bonds of cell walls and membranes.</i>  <i>Under their action, the mechanism of ‚Äúself-destruction‚Äù of pathogenic bacteria is activated.</i>  <i>At present, the composition is applied at the dental faculty at the Kirov State Medical University</i> , ‚Äùsaid <b>Georgy Frolov</b> , the head of the research group and <b>associate professor of the Department of Physical Chemistry at NRT MISiS</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f76/301/e21/f76301e2183a670c2b1dd9821a3b81ed.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>George Frolov</i> <br><br>  The resulting nanoparticles in dental materials have a unique property - they work as antibiotics, but without side effects, that is, they suppress the development of pathogenic microorganisms, and, as studies show, in most cases do not inhibit the vital activity of the natural microflora, and do not affect the cells of body tissues .  In the resulting material, the research team decided to solve the long-standing problem of "spending" the antibacterial composition, which enters into a chemical reaction and is actually wasted, and it is impossible to add it to the sealed tooth.  The new composition works all the time the filling in the tooth, which is a serious advantage. <br><br>  ‚Äú <i>The development of scientists of the National University of Science and Technology MISiS is essentially a technological revolution in dentistry, since it is a new sixth generation dental composites.</i>  <i>At the phase separation boundary, this material creates a bactericidal effect that is not limited in time, and more than 40% improves the adhesion ‚Äúadhesion‚Äù of the seal to the tooth tissue.</i>  <i>Antibacterial additive can be used not only in the composition of the seal, but also in the adhesive, in composites, etching materials, interlayers, implants and in compositions for sealing dental fissures.</i>  <i>In all formats, it creates a superficial and volumetric antibacterial effect in the operated areas and ultimately prolongs the life of the seals and implants.</i>  <i>In our clinic, the drug has been successfully used since September 2016,</i> ‚Äùsaid the project participant, the <b>chief physician of the Rosdent clinic, Ph.D.</b>  <b>Jacob Karasenko</b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/48b/254/d44/48b254d44822e763bd8d4e4ca69198da.jpg" alt="image"><br>  <i>Jacob Karasenko</i> <br><br>  The comprehensive studies started in 2014 are an example of an effective public-private partnership in introducing new innovative technologies.  The main customer and co-investor of the development was one of the largest domestic manufacturers of dental materials LLC StomaDent, which currently produces innovative dental composites based on the developed preparations.  Composite filling nano-hybrid material was registered by Roszdravnadzor in 2016.  The project co-investor was the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation, which financed 50% of the cost of exploratory research in the framework of the Federal Targeted Program ‚ÄúResearch and Development in Priority Areas for the Development of the Research Complex of the Russian Federation‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/373339/">https://habr.com/ru/post/373339/</a></p>
