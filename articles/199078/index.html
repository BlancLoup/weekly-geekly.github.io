This topic seemed to me quite interesting (and far from exhausted) and this weekend I decided to continue describing such a phenomenon as ‚Äúhackers on the screen‚Äù and to add a collection of kinolyaps. <br><br>  At KDPV freeze-frame film "Iron Man-2."

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  In life, nothing happens.  Of course, something constantly happens in life: the wages are not given out on time, the child is sick, winter comes suddenly, but the series of pseudo-random situations is monotonous, like the work of a Chinese at the Foxconn factory.  That is why we love artistic fiction so much, in which the line of life is a flickering arrhythmia.  A doctor no-no, yes, and watch a series about doctors, a police officer about honest cops, the programmer will appreciate the film on IT-related subjects with the obligatory action, which in the real world is limited to cursing at the server room. <br><br>  What could be more rich and exciting than movies about hackers?  A good movie and bloopers will not spoil.  An attentive viewer will get a special pleasure, looking at the interfaces of cinema programs, flashing lines of code and the careless work of a technical consultant. <br><br>  Orthodox spectators are not so often among the spectators, who are ready to burn the brand for scriptwriters and directors for every blunder.  Mistakes in films are most often nothing more than a convention, adding to the spectacle.  It is difficult to blame the director for the spread of sound in space, if in all other respects the picture is captivating.  With such an opinion, you can see through your fingers steep hackers robbing banks, erasing digital traces of an individual, controlling any technique of ultra-fast typing on the keyboard without using spaces. <br><br>  Blunders in the films, whether they are connected with computers or not, are a funny little thing that you remember only on thematic Internet forums.  Or when the real masters of the word are already taken up, representatives of the cosmic horror that flies away any professionalism, endowed with such colossal, ultra-naked illiteracy, that they cover the neurons and axons of the viewer with a crust of thick dirty ice of insensitivity. <br><br>  We are talking about the creators of stereotypes, trying to please any audience.  Do you think in most movies hackers are faddish, but cute helpers of the main character, solving complex tasks solely by the power of the intellect?  It is distressing to realize how the film industry actually forms in the mass consciousness the image of an ordinary programmer, not to mention the guru of the high-tech environment.  If this is not the story of a person at Jobs level, you can do any obscenities with an IT person on the screen. <br><br>  One would assume that such scenes are the result of a NSA conspiracy with Hollywood producers, whose goal is to make the hacker's ‚Äúprofession‚Äù so complex and incomprehensible to discourage any ordinary (novice) users from wanting to learn programming languages, operating system vulnerabilities, or even the ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù tab. "In Facebook settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8db/397/3cc/8db3973cc1d586e798b0f96fe2d0fc3a.png"><br><br>  But, unfortunately, everything is much simpler: it is just the fruit of poor-quality work of scriptwriters who are trying to write about what they do not know.  After all, they could spend a few minutes searching Google to avoid embarrassing situations, but every time, in every scene, they convince us of their own pathological laziness.  Of course, this is just a movie, so ‚Äúsmart technologies‚Äù can look stupid as you please. <br><br><h5>  My "two pennies" in the collection of kinolyap: </h5><br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FRhGPVYRsOY&amp;xid=17259,15700023,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhApPjif2upPDdM7lJM5gAZIHtu5A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Do the authors really believe that most viewers are idiots?

You say that everything is ok?  This is actually the <i>only</i> real program appearing in movies.  In many tapes, Nmap is a formidable weapon of hackers (only JavaScript is more popular).  It does not matter how the characters use this program, the main thing is to show beautiful shots: <br><br>  Dredd (2012) ( <a href="">http://nmap.org/movies/dredd/dredd-nmap-trailer-screenshot-1589x805.jpg</a> ), <br>  Bourne Ultimatum (2007) ( <a href="">http://nmap.org/movies/bourne/bourne-nmap-1.png</a> ), <br>  Die Hard 4 (2007) ( <a href="">http://nmap.org/movies/diehard4/nmap-diehard4-1080p-1920x801.png</a> ), <br>  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2009) ( <a href="">http://nmap.org/movies/gwtdt/gwtdt-nmap-screen.jpg</a> ), <br>  Wiretap (2006) ( <a href="">http://nmap.org/movies/listening/2.png</a> ), <br>  Chase (2011) ( <a href="">http://nmap.org/movies/abduction/Abduction-Nmap-1920x800.jpg</a> ), <br>  Extract (2012) ( <a href="">http://nmap.org/movies/extracted/extracted-nmap-clip.png</a> ), <br>  Battle of the King (2000) ( <a href="">http://nmap.org/movies/matrix/Battle-Royale-Nmap-1-344x214.jpg</a> ). <br>  And even in the film HaXXXor: NoLongerFloppy. <br><br>  The quality of the films does not correlate with the use of real software in the plot.

The film "Iron Man 2" as if tells us "there is nothing difficult in this."  We take into account that the drone on the screen is controlled by a stern Russian programmer.  All three parts of the "Iron Man" incredibly pleased with the code, reconsider carefully. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/528/a93/c7f/528a93c7f6618d5c80c87059955fdf21.png"><br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0408345/">Firewall</a> (2006).

One of the most epic shots in ‚Äúhacker films‚Äù is hacking into driving with an app in a smartphone.  The hacker will not only open the car, but also be able to remotely disable the alarm.  This is not a simplification of technologies that are difficult for viewers.  This is just cheating. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b06/8e2/091/b068e209108ba7b6b61c0503f4ec0cdb.jpg"><br>  Hacking system in the movie "Tournament for survival." <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6e3/9f8/000/6e39f8000d4235ea44225bb68ccf082f.png"><br>  So in the series " <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2193021/%3Fref_%3Dnv_sr_1">Strela</a> " looks "military-level encryption algorithm." <br><br>  To continue this list is endless.  ‚Äú <i>So what,‚Äù you say, even in the most stupid scene (NBC, Life) there is a certain element of entertainment.</i>  <i>We will forgive everything for him!</i>  "Friends, police find out that the only way to get an encrypted file is to go through the game" Prince of Persia: Two Thrones "up to level 10, after which the secret file will be opened on the screen;  the hacker actually rewrote the code of the game to crank up such a cunning trick.  This is not the horror.  Who do you think dares to go through all the tests to get the file?  The man who says the following phrase: " <i>Detective, I am 30 years old, I live with my mother and I have Captain Kirk's costume in the closet</i> ." <br><br>  PS It is necessary to recognize that not all screenwriters (or cinema interface designers) are equally lazy.  Thanks for the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/sovgvd/" class="user_link">SovGVD</a> tip: ‚ÄúThe Revolution series (season 1 approximately 19 episodes), at the time of hacking / authorization at the Tower access terminal, the code is visible, Google pointed to a <a href="">github</a> with a biometric authorization / recognition system.‚Äù <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/comment_images/e6b/8f8/f71/e6b8f8f7181b82ae8b848d4037f9c795.jpg"><br><br>  Of course, it is not clear why to display this code on the screen at the time of authorization, but still it is much better than a code snippet from an online store of air conditioners :) <br><br>  PPS The number of films and TV shows that go on a daily basis is amazing (oh, if we could collect all these budgets, let them go into space exploration ...) And considering that more and more people deal with computers, computer scenes will all appear More and more often.  So I will be glad if someone picks up this baton and writes a "sequel" to this post :) </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/199078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/199078/</a></p>
