Influencing proprietary software is not easy, and there is no incentive - even if you point out errors, they are unlikely to pay.  But there is a solution - open source software. <br><br><img src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/Brueghel-tower-of-babel.jpg/400px-" alt="Large open source project in development"><br>  <b>Large open source project in development</b>

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  Adjustable Soft: Sketch </h4><br><br>  Most of the necessary code has already been developed in Open Source, but unfortunately there are some problems: <br><ul><li>  far not always the code is brought to a logical end </li><li>  overwhelmingly, there are problems with the Russian localization </li><li>  open source applications are poorly integrated with each other - where a large developer delivers an integrated application, Open Source implementers are forced to install separate applications </li><li>  government agencies want to work with certified software, and therefore no open source software does not suit them </li><li>  not always open source software contains all the features necessary for business - for example, if you have a serious business, then all conversations with clients should be recorded, but not all Open Source video conferencing supports video conversation recording </li><li>  sadly, in Open Source - the image of software written on the knees of self-made, despite the fact that the programming culture in Open Source has increased significantly, not to mention the fact that a large part of the code is presented to the Open Source community by companies that are professionally engaged in software development </li></ul><br><br><h4>  Adjustable Soft: technical side </h4><br><br>  Based on this, a software concept emerges, which I call Adjustable Soft - adaptable software.  The approach contains a considerable share of consulting, because only by understanding the structure of a business can one understand what minimum functionality is required for the operation of an enterprise.  In addition, you need to start from the premise that you do not need to program anything from scratch, all the main things are already implemented in Open Source - you just need to find it.  After a similar solution is found, the addition of features and software configuration for a specific task is required.  All changes in accordance with the license are laid back to Open Source and this simplifies the implementation of similar projects.  Also, it would be nice to move Open Source projects in the direction of greater modularity, so that Russian localization was a matter of replacing a single text message file, rather than turning into a painful separation of code from text.  The Open Source community will benefit from all this - the participants of these projects work much more fun if they see that someone needs the product.  You should see them as they program, when they see a return - in a month they achieve such results as our small (~ 5 people) team cannot achieve even in half a year.  Naturally, all user settings are made in the form of plug-ins and are not laid out for general viewing. <br><br><h4>  Adjustable Soft: administrative side </h4><br><br>  And finally, countless formal things, without which software cannot live - certification, participation in tenders, implementation, code analysis for the presence of ‚Äúbookmarks‚Äù from a likely adversary (do not laugh, power structures - the desired target audience), cultural technical support in Russian .  All this will allow Open Source software to breathe, to reveal its potential.  And programmers will give hiring and a piece of bread and butter.  I put the tower of Babel in the heading precisely because the administrative side does not allow developers and users of Open Source software to be completely satisfied with each other and a mediator is needed who will overcome differences, speak with everyone in his language. <br><br><h4>  Adjustable soft: success story </h4><br><br>  <a href="http://www.expressaas.com/index.php%3Foption%3Dcom_content%26view%3Darticle%26id%3D47:openmeetings-desc%26catid%3D25:the-openmeetings%26Itemid%3D34">The solution for video conferencing</a> based on the above concept has the experience of successful adaptation, implementation and maintenance.  It is implemented by one large insurer.  The solution works in any browser with Adobe Flash support and uses regular webcams.  Everyone is happy. <br><br><h4>  Adjustable soft: conclusions </h4><br><br>  Good fiction is different from the usual in that it contains a powerful, exciting idea.  Such a key idea in the <a href="http://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D1%2580%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0">Chronicles of Amber</a> Roger Zelazny was traveling among reflections - the true Prince of Amber can reach any place to his liking just by imagining it to himself, and it is unclear whether this is a search among countless options for reality or an act of creation.  The above principle of working with Open Source is somewhat similar to this - the developer is looking for a project on the network that is suitable for him and changes it the way his own vision is.  Open source projects are like unrealized variants of being, and only the presence of an interested developer and customer make some of them real. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/63200/">https://habr.com/ru/post/63200/</a></p>
