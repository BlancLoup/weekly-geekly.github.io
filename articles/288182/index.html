  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Sources of income online media. Part I</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Matthew Sollars <a href="http://newsinnovation.com/revenue-opportunities/">published the first batch of</a> income sources that online media can use.  The list is based on a review of <u>existing</u> media practices in the United States and Europe.  The emphasis is on innovative approaches, so the list does not include the main source - banner advertising.  I publish this list especially for those skeptics who actively brushed off and wriggled in the comments under my notes and translations about business models for online media published earlier.  Of course, in Russia, the reality is different, yet someone else's experience may be useful. <br>  <b>UPD The</b> second part of the article "Sources of income online media" can be read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mass_media/66276/">here</a> . <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, the list. <br><br><h4>  New advertising options </h4><br>  Suitable for: all. <br><br>  Coupons and Deals of the Day <br>  Although Twitter promises to change our ideas about the delivery of coupons and offers, for advertisers it is still easier to use the media to reach a large audience at once.  For the newspaper <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/">The Ann Arbor News</a> now <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/deals/">offers of the day</a> - the main source of income.  <a href="http://www.minnpost.com/">MinnPost</a> recently launched <a href="http://www.minnpost.com/realtimeads/">a real-time ad service</a> .  Others are trying to build a business using private ads up to 140 characters.  There are good opportunities for geo-targeting and hyper local content.

      Sponsored Publications <br>  Sites like <a href="http://paidcontent.org/">Paid Content have</a> begun to use new ad slots right on their list of publications.  They look like regular posts, but the author is not listed in them, and they are written by the advertiser. <br><br><h4>  Video </h4><br>  Suitable for: all. <br><br>  Old proven format for a new type of media.  Since the cost of organizing video on the site has plummeted, advertisers are actively looking for opportunities to shove their ads on news sites.  Many are already experimenting, including advertising before showing their content ( <a href="http://video.on.nytimes.com/">pre-roll</a> ) and organizing all sorts of gadgets to display it during the show. <br><br><h4>  E-commerce </h4><br>  Suitable for: media in major cities <br><br>  There are many guys in the States who have managed to make money on branded products such as mugs and logo t-shirts.  But in general, e-commerce is not far removed from this.  The exception is the radio, which uses the program of affiliates Amazon.  And in the United Kingdom, the newspaper Telegraf has developed a contextual online store.  Of course, the development of a store that analyzes the text of publications and offers relevant products has cost much.  I had to tinker with the choice of suppliers.  It's funny that canopies and Panamas are the most in demand of Telegraf, nevertheless it is an important source of income for them. <br>  They also established a system of fees for transactions made from their site.  The newspaper takes a percentage for sports betting and mortgage design made in the "Sport" and "Personal Finance".  This is common in the United States on sites that sell tickets to sports and cultural events.  Even The New York Times got carried away with it. <br><br><h4>  Paid content </h4><br>  Suitable for: media in major cities <br><br>  With the fall in advertising revenue, newspapers across the country are seriously considering drawing up a paid subscription to online content.  Despite the fact that by blocking access to content, you limit your readability, publishers like Walter Hussman, which publishes <a href="http://www2.arkansasonline.com/">The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette</a> , claim that an online subscription helps prevent print subscription erosion (and keep high ad prices) because they don‚Äôt Do not give away free online. <br>  New business models that combine subscription and micropayments are already on the way.  Major newspapers are saying that they are increasingly looking towards accounting readability on the model of that used by the Financial Times.  It allows the reader to view 10 publications for free, and then asks to pay. <br><br><h4>  Lists and databases </h4><br>  Suitable for: media in major cities, business and other industry publications <br><br>  The sale of data was a major source of revenue for newspapers and weeklies like <a href="http://www.chicagobusiness.com/cgi-bin/businessList.pl">Crain</a> , and this market does not go anywhere.  Part of the data can be published free of charge, integrating advertising into them.  Full volumes can be sold one-time, for unlimited access to data, you can ask to issue a one-year subscription. <br>  A separate collection of lists (top business by industry, legal services by districts, the most actively growing neighborhoods, etc.), published once a year, will attract the attention of major advertisers and increase the popularity of your brand. <br>  This category also reveals great opportunities for mobile applications.  Almost everything that you sell in lists and databases can be combined with geo-targeting.  It will be a great application. <br><br><h4>  Mobile technology </h4><br>  Suitable for: all <br><br>  The opportunity for earnings is obvious: take a fee for a mobile application that delivers the latest news, or take a fee for delivering news via SMS.  Apple's experience shows that people pay for mobile apps.  As Mark Potts argues, even hyper-local media is worth doing because it is inexpensive.  In addition, the application can be embedded advertising. <br>  Very interesting ideas appear every day in the field of geo-targeted advertising on mobile devices.  Think about the possibility of combining geo-location and their databases. <br><br><h4>  Premium Products </h4><br>  Suitable for: media in major cities <br><br>  Along with its online store, the British Telegraph received significant revenue from the sale of CluedUp puzzles and fantastic sports games to its website.  About fantastic sports may already be forgotten in the US, but games and puzzles remain a premium segment that can attract a significant number of subscribers.  With the hypothetical market of a large city of 5 million inhabitants, if you attract the attention of a conservative million, convince at least 2% of them to issue an annual subscription, and you will receive a large stable source of income. <br><br><h4>  Niche Websites </h4><br>  Suitable for: media in major cities <br><br>  Media in large cities should abandon branded publications aimed at specific communities of interest.  It is necessary to do not single or serial publications, but separate sites.  Maybe somewhere a school sports website will work, but in most cases a website with a wider coverage of education in general, such as <a href="http://gothamschools.org/">New York's Gotham Schools,</a> will become profitable.  Obviously, in a new decentralized news ecosystem, these niche sites can be completely independent.  Interesting fact: <a href="http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/">The Voice of San Diego is</a> now thinking about how to make a niche site around cemetery subjects. <br><br><h4>  Donations </h4><br>  Suitable for: non-profit media, investigative journalism, niche publications, political (including opposition) <br><br>  Donations are an excellent source of income for non-profit media, because donors can then use them to reduce their taxes.  But the commercial media do not disdain to stretch a mug to collect.  David Boraks, who publishes <a href="http://davidsonnews.net/">DavidsonNews.net</a> , has been very successful in collecting what he calls "voluntary subscription payments." <br>  <a href="http://www.spot.us/">Spot.Us</a> went further.  They allowed readers to pay a little for articles they like. <br><br><h4>  Printed versions </h4><br>  Suitable for: media of large cities, hyper-local media, commercial media, non-commercial media. <br><br>  Print editions once a week or a month can help make money.  Many advertisers, especially at the local level, prefer to see their ads in print.  Hyperlocal media can follow the example of the German edition of MyHeimat, which uses the inverse model - prints free weekly.  A printed product, even one that is published once a year on the occasion of some event, helps to increase fame, which will lead to higher prices for advertising.  Regular release of print versions can help you start making money from distributing someone else's tabs, which remains very profitable. <br><br>  Media major cities can produce thematic issues (rather, monthly) to secure sales.  Hyperlocal should look at the weekly, as recommended by Lisa Williams (Lisa Willams) from Placeblogger.com.  The best solution, according to her, for a hyper-local blogger is to publish a weekly review of stores.  For a relatively low cost - about 2 times cheaper than most local publishers - a blogger can cover its territory and expand the advertiser base.  Resources like <a href="http://www.printcasting.com/">printcasting.com</a> will help reduce printing costs, which will increase margins.  However, have to work hard.  Williams says: ‚ÄúThe main problem is that you personally do everything.  You yourself come up with a design, impose.  And this is a lot of work, there are a lot of little things. ‚Äù <br><br><h4>  Special reports </h4><br>  Suitable for: non-profit media, investigative journalism <br><br>  The Voice of San Diego told us that it was going to investigate private requests on a commercial basis.  Although so far no such has been done, they hope this will help diversify their income base.  Something similar may work for other non-commercial media that specialize in investigations. <br><br>  The second part of the article "Sources of income online media" can be found <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mass_media/66276/">here</a> . <br>  ================================== <br><br>  Who cares, look here again these publications and translations: <br><ul><li>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mass_media/56516/">21st century media.</a>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/mass_media/56516/">Part 5.
