In many cases, an illustration will help you out!  Oddly enough, but the services of a photographer are much more expensive than ordering an illustration on the same topic!  It means that not only is cheaper, but faster you will get a ready-made layout for further work with it. <br><br><img src="http://illustrators.ru/guest/137/p_5381.jpg" alt="image"><br><h6>  <i>picture to attract attention</i> </h6><h6>  Illustrator - Anton Bugaev </h6><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Pluses illustration </h2><br>  - Once again - this is a relatively small cost of illustration.  Even with the most famous author you get a high-quality image much cheaper than hiring a photographer, model, designer, for the same realization of your goal.

      - Many illustrators can make the image a little different from a good photo, and in many cases even better! <br><br>  - The illustration looks in many cases more spectacular than a photo, since against the background of widespread photo advertising - an illustration is quite a rarity! <br><br>  - Draw an illustration much faster in time, which means that if the deadlines are tight, then the illustration is the real way out! <br><br>  - With an illustration it is easier to work and correct defects and adjust according to colors. <br><br><h2>  Cons of illustration </h2><br>  - It is not always possible to use exactly the illustration.  There are areas where you have to work only with the photographer.  For example, cosmetics. <br><br>  - A playful mood of illustration does not always create a serious impression about the company, but in my opinion this is a problem of pure style. <br><br>  - In Russia, there are practically no agencies that offer illustrator services.  At the moment, Artemy Lebedev's studio is professionally engaged in selling illustrations, which means in most cases you will have to contact private freelancers, which entails delaying the deadlines and all possible problems associated with this! <br><br>  - It is necessary to understand all the variety of styles and to clearly understand what image should be the result of your joint work with the author. <br><br>  - It is quite difficult to describe the future illustration, because in most cases you have to be an illustrator yourself. <br><br><h2>  How much is an illustration </h2><br>  In Russia, the cost of illustration is not built under any market laws, unlike in Western countries.  Our price for an illustration is determined by the author‚Äôs fame and appetites.  Moreover, the quality of the illustration often does not affect the price, you can find a less promoted author who will ask for his illustrations from $ 500 to $ 1,000 and a no less talented artist who will draw you the same in quality work for $ 100 to $ 200.  However, often extra $ 100 - $ 200 will save the customer extra nerves and time, since the more expensive illustrator may be more experienced and his work will not need to make a lot of corrections.  Therefore, my advice is not to save and contact either the agency or an experienced author. <br><br>  The average price on the market for a standard illustration is $ 200-300. <br><br>  Also the price of illustrations depends on where it will be used.  Agree, if the image will be used on 1000 billboards across Moscow, such an illustration can not be cheap.  There is a direct relationship between price and carrier. <br><br><h2>  Illustration genres </h2><br>  I would define 5 basic genres of illustrations: <br><br><h4>  Advertising illustration </h4><br>  It's all clear!  Any illustration that is drawn for advertising is advertising!  This illustration is the most expensive and difficult to render, as marketers place special attention on such an illustration.  Almost at all stages of drawing there is total control over any manifestation of creativity and freedom.  The customer often clearly knows what he wants to receive, especially if the customer is an advertising agency!  Here the author does not need to invent anything, everything was invented for him! <br><br>  I would also refer the so-called storyboards to the advertising illustration.  Storyboard is something like a comic book that describes, frame by frame, the main points of the future commercial.  Kinda is a set of rules for the production operator.  A good storyboarder should have a great sense of composition and be proficient in the technique of drawing people in motion.  Such authors are worth their weight in gold, since this work is somewhat dull, dreary and does not bring proper satisfaction to the author.  Therefore, many storyboarders quickly ‚Äúburn out‚Äù and do not want to participate in such orders. <br><br><img src="http://vschumann.files.wordpress.com/2007/10/fog-store.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Examples of advertising illustrations: <br><img src="http://illustrators.ru/guest/1042/p_21253.jpg" alt="image"><br>  author - Tatiana Doronina <br><br><img src="http://illustrators.ru/guest/919/p_18896.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The author - Litvinova Natalia <br><br><img src="http://illustrators.ru/guest/1807/p_15920.jpg" alt="image"><br>  author - Artem Zubov <br><br>  Where to find the author: <br><br>  <a href="http://illustrators.ru/">Illustrators.ru</a> site <br>  Site <a href="http://free-lance.ru/">free-lance.ru</a> <br>  Agency Visual Storm <a href="http://visualstorm.ru/">visualstorm.ru</a> <br>  Bang Bang Agency!  <a href="http://www.bangbangstudio.ru/">bangbangstudio.ru</a> <br>  Learn <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_illustrators/">ru_illustrators</a> <br>  Art. Lebedev Studio <br><br><h4>  Magazine illustration </h4><br>  The most creative genre is in illustration, since magazines do not require clarity in what should be depicted and often this is given to the author.  Here the artist can prove himself fully.  However, magazines require a finished image too quickly, so the author has to figure out how to make the illustration most effective when using the smallest pictorial techniques. <br><br>  Such magazines as Poster and the Big City welcome minimalism in the illustration.  Often it is these illustrations that are mainstream and trendy!  And the authors of such illustrations themselves become famous in the art environment. <br><br>  Examples of journal illustration: <br><img src="http://illustrators.ru/guest/320/p_24434.jpg" alt="image"><br>  by Yves Orlov <br><br><img src="http://illustrators.ru/guest/57/p_23997.jpg" alt="image"><br>  by Valentin Tkach <br><br><img src="http://illustrators.ru/guest/2475/p_23291.jpg" alt="image"><br>  author - Olga Gromova <br><br>  Where to find the author: <br><br>  <a href="http://illustrators.ru/">Illustrators.ru</a> site <br>  <b>Association of Illustrators Workshop</b> <a href="http://www.tzeh.ru/">tzeh.ru</a> <br>  Agency Visual Storm <a href="http://visualstorm.ru/">visualstorm.ru</a> <br>  Bang Bang Agency!  <a href="http://www.bangbangstudio.ru/">bangbangstudio.ru</a> <br>  Learn <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_illustrators/">ru_illustrators</a> <br>  Art. Lebedev Studio <br><br><h4>  Book illustration </h4><br>  Book illustration is the most ungrateful genre.  Pay for such illustrations a little, and the attitude of book publishers to the details in such images is often zealous.  This particularly applies to children's book illustration.  The result of this policy, in my opinion, is the absence of a new wave of authors in book illustration.  Almost all the most famous artists are people of the age, with the Soviet school of illustration.  All of them draw illustrations in the old-fashioned way by hand, with pencils and paints, of course there is a certain charm, but the new time requires new techniques and speed!  But this is still half the trouble.  Since the school of illustration in Russia is currently absent and new authors are self-taught, we have this horror on the shelves of stores, which does not turn my tongue anyway!  The authors of the old Soviet school are stupidly unable to cope with the flow of books that appears, there are too few of them and they take one book for a very long time. <br><br>  Examples of book illustration: <br><img src="http://illustrators.ru/guest/3698/p_25418.jpg" alt="image"><br>  by Natalia Bronnikova <br><br><img src="http://illustrators.ru/guest/1558/p_25338.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The author - Luchkina Yuliya <br><br><img src="http://illustrators.ru/guest/1805/p_24622.jpg" alt="image"><br>  author - Alexey Kurbatov <br><br>  Where to find the author: <br><br>  <a href="http://illustrators.ru/">Illustrators.ru</a> site <br>  Association of Illustrators Workshop <a href="http://www.tzeh.ru/">tzeh.ru</a> <br>  <b>Agency Izadeteli</b> <a href="http://www.izdateli.ru/">izdateli.ru</a> <br>  Learn <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_illustrators/">ru_illustrators</a> <br>  Art. Lebedev Studio <br><br><h4>  Stock Illustration </h4><br>  Relatively new direction in illustration.  It is a vector clipart on all sorts of topics - fruits, patterns, cars and so on.  Also, in my opinion, a very ungrateful topic, because to make money with this illustration you need to draw hundreds of illustrations!  And since the competition is very high, every year the drawing of such illustrations becomes more and more difficult, since everything that can already be painted a long time ago, you can only compete with image quality.  On microstocks such an illustration is from $ 1 to $ 10.  Very useful for any postcards or internal documentation, presentations, and so on.  Because of its cheapness, the demand for stock illustrations is consistently high.  In microstocks, the author sells the same image several dozen, or even hundreds of times. <br><br>  Examples of stock illustrations: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/435/427/024/435427024162555c81f2516cbf26e0a5.jpg" alt="image"><br>  author unknown <br><br>  Where to find the author: <br><br>  <b>Stock site <a href="http://www.shutterstock.com/">ShutterStock.com</a></b> <br>  <b>Stock site <a href="http://www.iphoto.com/">iphoto.com</a></b> <br><br><h4>  Web illustration </h4><br>  Various icons, decorations, flash games, banners ‚Äì‚Äì any image drawn for the web represents this new genre in the illustration.  More often - this is a purely technical illustration, which also implies a minimum of creativity.  A very specific genre, as it is relatively difficult to find professionals in such an illustration.  I believe that such an illustration implies a certain set of rules and stylistic limitations, which not all authors guess.  Therefore, ordering an illustration for the site, try to find examples of images you like on other sites at least.  It is better if you find professionals in this field and work with them. <br><br>  Examples of web illustrations: <br><img src="http://st.free-lance.ru/users/nid/upload/f_4921592a3e6ee.jpg" alt="image"><br>  author - Anastasiya Ju <br><br><img src="http://st.free-lance.ru/users/Xameleon/upload/f_49e3651543ae7.jpg" alt="image"><br>  author - Vladimir Levchenko <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f15/350/2af/f153502af722830b999e330dc9cefbcb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  author - TurboMilk agency <br><br>  Where to find the author: <br><br>  Site <a href="http://free-lance.ru/">free-lance.ru</a> <br>  <b>Site <a href="http://revision.ru/">revision.ru</a></b> <br>  <b>Learn <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/ru_designers/">ru_designers</a></b> <br><br>  On this perhaps all, we are waiting for the wishes, what else would you like to know about illustrations and illustrators, but were afraid to ask! <br><br>  PS: The information in this article is only pure speculation of the author and may not coincide with the opinion of other members of the art community. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/61699/">https://habr.com/ru/post/61699/</a></p>
