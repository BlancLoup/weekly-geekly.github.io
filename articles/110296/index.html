  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Discount services. Why zadolbali discounts of 50% or more?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/bestkupon/blog/110288/">Inspired by the fresh topic of the</a> next coupon service.  The low entry threshold and relative simplicity of this business have led to a large number of questionable quality discount services, coupons and group purchases.  The promise of captivating novelty - get expensive cheap.  Skidcochnik assure us that this effect is achieved through advertising and wholesale components - supposedly companies get new customers and are willing to pay for it with a discount, or at the expense of a group wholesale order, the product is cheaper.  Let me suggest that in 90% of cases it is not.  Discounts are offered for products with initially very high wrap and products that are reluctant to disassemble without discount.  Simply put - firms merge heavy-selling and unreasonably expensive products at a fraction of the price, using the effect of an anchor from psychology, or simply the burden of a person for freebies. <br><br>  Fortunately or unfortunately, it works and both parties are often satisfied.  But I will try to identify the pitfalls under the cut ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1. Goods - a cat in a bag.  Rules dictated by the seller.  The cost of a customer‚Äôs drive in such systems is comparable to other advertising channels, so don‚Äôt hope to get a better offer in principle, a smart seller will not go with a minus or zero for the sake of such advertising (why - I‚Äôll tell you below).  The seller will provide the best price for its most unprofitable offer.  Those.  sellers with the greatest zeal will provide goods and services with the highest margin and with the lowest demand.  In 90% of cases, you either buy a heavily overvalued product or a stale one.  This must be realized. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      2. In 90% of the offers, the original price indicated does not correspond to the market price.  Those.  the price is artificially overpriced, a corresponding high discount is attributed to it and the selling price is obtained.  Many buyers are not aware of the final identity of the expressions ‚ÄúFrying pan for $ 50‚Äù and ‚ÄúFrying pan for $ 100, but we have for $ 50‚Äù and do not compare prices in the market, where a similar frying pan can do twice as cheaply without a stock.  Always look at the final offer. <br><br>  3. In most cases, the buyer, driven by thirst for freebies, buys goods or services that does not need.  Thus, instead of abandoning the purchase at all and guaranteed 100% savings, they are conducted on an imaginary savings of 50%.  Some buyers do not use the received coupon at all, especially if the price is low because  can not be adjusted to the conditions of use or just laziness or at the right time do not have a coupon at hand, etc., etc.  Before buying, consider whether you need a product, regardless of the current mega-action. <br><br>  4. In addition to the effect of the anchor, which makes us evaluate the goods at the named price, there is also a direct relationship between the perceived pleasure from the purchase and its price.  Those.  going to a restaurant brings less pleasure if you get half the price.  Evening dresses are less comfortable worn, if you know that it costs not a thousand dollars, but only a hundred.  Also, the moment of conscious overpayment adds an extra buzz - someone likes to buy something which he usually (regularly) cannot afford, for someone the price is directly associated with quality, etc., etc.  In general, a discount dropped from the sky on some services can bring discomfort. <br><br>  5. Although the percentage of insolent couponers who squeeze out all the juice from the stock is sufficiently small, in general, the audience loyalty tends to zero.  Those.  A restaurant placing a discount on discount sites as a rule cannot count on the return of customers after a promotion.  Because  Tomorrow there will be another coupon and the client will go to another restaurant, respectively, the cost of attracting a client must be recaptured once, which makes the seller invent any tricks to increase the check. <br><br>  6. If you buy a discount for a fixed amount, do not be fooled by its indication as a percentage.  The action pay 500 rubles, get a discount for 1000 rubles effectively is a discount for 500 rubles, you should not operate with a discount of 50%.  With a probability of 99%, your final bill will be either less than a fixed amount and you will lose part of the discount, or the check will be higher, and at the expense of the surcharge the effective discount will be less.  When choosing, do not be fooled by the indication of discounts and to - evaluate only the final price and market serviceability. <br><br>  In general, just do not forget that the interests of the seller and the buyer are diametrically opposed, and only by a miracle this business keeps the win-win course of mutual benefit.  Before buying, do not think about how to miss your own, better think about how not to give too much, then you will not lose. <br><br>  PS I do not in any way agitate to burn coupons and discolour discount sites and with great pleasure I offer lucrative offers.  I am only for the buyers to adequately evaluate the offer, and the sellers do not abuse the trust of the buyers. <br><br>  PS2.  Actually, what about the start-ups blog?  Dear startups, finish already launching trashy group clones - this is a wonderful and useful niche in which there is a place and money for real wine and wine, finally find your chips and highlights, bring something new, useful to this business.  And then to multiply only due to the breadth of the market - well, not tired? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/110296/">https://habr.com/ru/post/110296/</a></p>
