In order to make a choice, you must first decide on the advantages of these two tools.  In social networks, company employees can communicate with customers in real time.  Customers, in turn, are engaged in "advertising" by sharing information about the company's products or services on their walls.  With the help of email newsletter you can personalize the offer as much as possible and send only what the subscriber is interested in.  But they also have similarities: communication with customers, increasing loyalty, increasing traffic, collecting leads. <br>  There is such a statement that 40% of users intersect on the social network and have a mailing list.  You start to communicate with the same subscribers only with the help of different tools, but there are still 60% of the remaining customers with whom you need to work. <br>  Then why divide social networks and email marketing if, by combining them, we get a mega powerful tool?  There is synergy for this.  With it, you can get more opportunities to attract new customers, track their actions, better segmentation, purchase motivation, etc. <br><br> <a href="https://sendpulse.com/ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1de/292/dbb/1de292dbb1f44c24a10c73bab613076b.jpg"></a> <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b><u>How to transfer mailing list subscribers to the social network page</u></b>

For example, ‚Äúyou will be able to receive news, discounts, promotions notifications from our company‚Äù, ‚Äúall signatories will receive a gift certificate‚Äù, offers to participate in contests. </li></ul><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a8f/8e7/87f/a8f8e787f7e64ac48930e948e097be93.png"><br><br><ul><li>  <b>Motivate</b> subscribers to participate in a promotion or competition by <b>specifying how the prize will be.</b> </li><li>  <b>Add ‚ÄúLike‚Äù and ‚ÄúShare‚Äù buttons</b> to your newsletter and then even an unregistered user will be able to distribute your content. </li></ul><br><br>  <b><u>How to convince community members or friends to subscribe to your newsletter</u></b> <br><br>  1. <b>Place on the site a form for collecting addresses.</b>  Make it simple by requiring you to fill in only the name and have an address.  Offer a free gift or bonus in exchange for data, this will increase your chances to collect as many contacts as possible. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f73/407/033/f734070337eb4bc9adae84d7c3d5fb28.png"><br><br>  2. <b>Ask to subscribe</b> , pointing out the benefits of a subscription. <br>  3. <b>Post announcements of events with links to registration</b> and use them in your email list in order to transfer users to the category of regular subscribers. <br>  If you offer a person to register for a webinar, then first give him 5 free lessons to prepare, announcing a regular newsletter in the same letters. <br><br>  <b><u>How to work simultaneously with two tools?</u></b> <br><br>  Despite the fact that social networks and email distribution work in synergy, these are still two different tools.  Part of your audience will overlap, so the content should not be duplicated.  You can repeat only the most important, for example, announcements of events, contests, discounts and promotions. <br>  You can use comments from social networks as motivators in the newsletter or to work with abandoned baskets to motivate the customer to complete the purchase. <br>  If the results of testing your email list showed good results - place it in social networks for discussion. <br><br>  <b><u>Content for email newsletter</u></b> <br><br><ul><li>  <b>Unique articles</b> from the field of your business. </li><li>  <b>Backstage news.</b>  Tell your subscribers what's going on inside your company. </li><li>  <b>Opinions of experts in your area.</b>  This can be either a separate article or comments on the social network. </li><li>  <b>Postreleases after certain activities.</b>  Place photos on the page, invite subscribers to see them, mark themselves and comment. </li><li>  <b>Messages about their achievements.</b>  For example, the news of a major transaction or adding another section to the site. </li><li>  <b>Reviews, selections and recommendations.</b>  For example, book reviews from your area of ‚Äã‚Äãexpertise, collections of applications that will make life easier for subscribers. </li></ul><br><br>  <b><u>Content for social networks</u></b> <br><br>  <b>Place</b> on your page <b>70% of the entertainment and learning content, and only 30% of the advertising.</b> <br>  Here is what can be used as entertainment and learning content: <b><u>infographics, quotes, jokes, photos, promotions, contests, selections, announcements, tests.</u></b> <br>  We have provided only the basic options, then the case for your imagination.  Make sure that the direction of your activity is clearly traced in the content.  But in order to keep track of current topics in social networks, a couple of useful programs will help you: <br><br>  <b><a href="http://www.socialmention.com/">Socialmention</a></b> keeps track of current topics in 100 social networks.  You can be one of the first to publish news that is gaining popularity. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/473/4d9/806/4734d98060f24fbba1307ea6a04cecdb.png"><br><br>  <b><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201285">Topsy</a></b> is a social media search site that is fairly simple to use. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b9/034/c9e/8b9034c9e96744d8bebda405913941e6.png"><br><br>  <b><a href="https://www.youscan.ru/">YouScan</a></b> is a Russian-language service that monitors Facebook, Twitter, VK and YouTube. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e3d/38e/ae7/e3d38eae79934340a6a5c56f7f512ece.png"><br><br>  So, we can conclude that email marketing and social networks are still two different tools, but with their combination, you can expand business goals and speed up their achievement. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/297750/">https://habr.com/ru/post/297750/</a></p>
