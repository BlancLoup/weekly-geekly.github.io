      BUT).  I really am not the ‚Äúapple chief‚Äù in Russia; for more than 25 months they have been the head of the Russian representative office of Apple.  Was Valery Lanovenko, became Ekaterina Shabanova. <br><br>  B).  I am bound by a contract with Apple, and I cannot comment on Apple‚Äôs actions in any way, speak on behalf of Apple, disclose information about products, plans, and touch on everything that constitutes a commercial secret of a corporation.  Please treat this with understanding. <br><br>  I will express my thoughts in one text, trying to answer all the questions in it.  I will answer those questions that are in my area of ‚Äã‚Äãcompetence.  The rest of the questions will be answered by our employees - Petya Semenov (Bonzo) - from the restor, Masha Golenkova - from Dihaus. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now about who I am.  I began working in 1990 at Intermicro, a joint venture ( <i>yes, yes, <a href="">the same</a> :) - approx.</i>  <i>Shuha</i> ), from 1991 to 1992, was the only Apple IMC in the USSR and the first in Russia.  In Intermikro, I was engaged in the sales of publishing systems, and almost 15 years ago I created and continuously led the company, which was from 1996 to 2008.  Apple IMC in Russia, Belarus, Moldova and the South Caucasus, from 1998 to 2009 in Ukraine, from 2001 to 2009 in Central Asia, and even for several years in Latvia and Lithuania.  Now we work only in Russia, we have a distribution contract with Apple since February 2008.  All these years, our contract was non-exclusive, but the Apple business model implied the existence of a single partner.  I can add that we got an IMC contract both in Russia and in 13 countries of the former USSR because all (!) Our predecessors in these countries (and these are 5 different companies) turned out to be financially untenable.  Someone left quietly, someone with a terrible crash.  For us for all these years, Apple had no financial claims, even during the crisis of 98, and this year.  Since the opening, the Apple office has gradually taken away from us the localization, marketing, service, authorization of resellers, technical support, ‚Äúgrocery‚Äù sales training, shop-in-shop management in retail networks. <br><br>  The company has gone through many changes in these 15 years.  At first it was called DPI, in recent years known as the ECS holding.  It has a computer part (ECS Group) and printing (ECS Print).  The ECS Group enlarges into 3 structures - Dihaus, DPI computers, ReStor / Premium Networks.  I am in charge of the whole holding, and each company has its own CEO, his own management.  The director of Dikhaus is Alexander Kabayev, the DPI is Mikhail Zaydfodim, the ReStor / Premium Network is Tikhon Smykov.  My functions include, briefly, ‚Äúinventing‚Äù strategies, financial management, policy of relations with suppliers, business development. <br><br>  Dyhaus is engaged only in distribution.  Two thirds of sales are focused on retail - federal, regional, local.  The product line consists of premium brands.  The share of Apple is the largest, but decreases, my goal is to reduce it to 25-30%.  The dealer network is growing rapidly, now there are almost 400 companies in it.  If we compare it with 2008 (it does not take into account the subdistribution of iPhones from one of the operators in the fall of 2008 and sales in the CIS), then in 2009 the volume did NOT decrease.  In Russia, earned a profit, which was zeroed by losses in the CIS. <br><br>  DPI Computers - the oldest company of the holding, is engaged in sales in education.  Last year she completed more than 300 projects.  He works with schools, kindergartens, colleges, vocational schools, universities.  The most famous and significant project that has been going on for many years in different regions of the country is equipping children with disabilities, that is, children unable for health reasons to attend school and students at home (so-called ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù schools are organized for them) or in special boarding schools.  DPI provided computers with thousands of such children.  Well, just during her work, PDI has put tens of thousands of poppies across the country into the education system.  The company is very efficient and bright. <br><br>  ReStor / Premium Networks.  The most difficult and interesting project for today.  We opened dozens of stores in the APR format (Apple Premium Reseller), started cooperation with SONY (6 stores of the Sony Center format, and big plans), with Nokia (1 Nokia store, 5 opened in December, and even more ambitious plans), with Lego (4 stores now, and a lot ahead).  In addition, with the support of Apple, we opened 10 APR stores in Germany, and we own Humac, which owns a total of 17 ‚Äúoutlets‚Äù in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.  In 2010 we will sell about 110 million Euros there.  (By the way, I write my answers on the plane, returning from the management meeting of the ReStor Europe) <br><br>  In principle, the company created and headed by me is one of the largest direct partners of Apple in Europe. <br><br>  So, I told about the company, here are the answers to other questions. <br><br>  The main one is <b>about prices</b> . <br><br>  I will not discover America by talking about pricing principles.  I understand that I will disappoint many, but there's nothing you can do.  The Russian market (as well as the CIS countries) is geographically within the zone controlled by Apple Europe.  As you certainly know, the region of ‚Äúbig Europe‚Äù (besides Europe itself and the countries of the former USSR there includes Africa, the Middle East and, more recently, India) is second in volume compared to America (albeit significantly less).  Europe has its own production base (plant in Cork, Ireland) and its own logistics.  And, of course, a different tax regime than in America. <br><br>  Our prices are comparable to European.  This means - are equal, or slightly different in one direction or another.  To compare correctly, subtract VAT from Russian prices.  At the same time, price fluctuations are associated with changes in the rate.  This can be illustrated with an example: the principles of pricing in the eurozone, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and, say, Norway, are the same.  But the exchange rate changes, and often strongly.  And prices start to vary. <br><br>  <b>How is the price formed in Russia?</b>  Very simple: the price of entry, VAT, distributor mark-up, mark-up reseller or retailer (retail network).  Distributor margin is within the average Russian distribution margin.  The same can be said about resellers.  The retailers' margin on Apple products is slightly lower than their average.  What I see ways to reduce prices for Russia? <br><br>  - The reduction by Apple itself of the difference between the American and European prices; <br>  - the convergence of the dollar and the euro; <br>  - reduction of VAT in Russia or replacement with sales tax, as in the USA or Canada; <br>  - reduction of retailers' margin; <br>  - reducing the distributor's margin. <br><br>  Reaching the last three points is possible with: <br>  - reduction (sharp, to the level of Europe) rental prices for retail; <br>  - reduction (sharp, to the level of Europe) of the cost of loans; <br>  - increase in the purchasing power of the population and, accordingly, demand; <br>  - the resumption and development (and cheapness) of consumer lending; <br>  - increase to the level of Europe of the demand for high-quality technology, plus the penetration and accessibility of the Internet, plus an effective fight against piracy and gray imports. <br><br>  Is the appearance of the second (third, fourth) distributor a means of lowering prices?  Yes, but only in terms of reducing the distribution margin, and is within a couple of percent. <br><br>  Is dumping online stores and gray dealers / retailers a means of lowering prices?  At first glance, yes.  But this is not so simple.  This destroys the channel, reduces the number of points of sales, leads to a shortage, and, as a result, to an increase in prices.  Why destroy the channel - is it bad?  ‚ÄúGray‚Äù do not pay VAT, and the margin due to this earn more than official dealers.  Money is not spent on support, on training sellers.  Official dealers (and especially retail!), Except for the largest ones, having stopped earning, will curtail Apple sales and will trade in something else.  And "gray", having sold the next batch, quietly dissolve into the air.  And then, you want to buy from such, as in the electronic markets, gloomy tongue-tied guys? <br><br>  As for the voiced proposal to haul from China ... And in China, in your opinion, how will Apple products fall?  In the "Russian" box, with Russian manuals, keyboard, operating system. <br><br>  <b>There</b> were questions <b>about the CIS</b> ... In Ukraine, a new distributor - the company ERC, in all other countries - ASBIS.  Unfortunately, it was not possible to maintain continuity, the supply of new goods ceased from January 1, and the distributors I named were signed, much less started to be transported much later.  Why this happened - the questions are not for me.  We did our best to ensure that this did not happen.  Now we have almost everywhere left the CIS.  In Kazakhstan, we sold our 7 ReStor points.  We are still working in Ukraine, collecting debts, selling off old goods, helping some retail chains.  We'll see, maybe we'll stay there.  Or maybe not.  In the CIS from Apple, Tatyana Akhmatova is responsible for the region.  She was responsible until 2007 for Russia, and one did the work, which now employs several people.  She is a good professional, sure, everything will be fine. <br><br>  <b>iPhone 3GS</b> .  In principle, as far as I am familiar with the topic, the state of affairs is correctly covered in the press: thanks to the constant information leaks from the operators :) That is to say, everything is sad: there is no need to wait for the coming of the Three Zhees.  For poor service, complain to Apple, plus on your side the Consumer Protection Act.  About good service write to Habrahabr :) <br><br>  <b>About the Russian "ITuns Musicstore" ...</b> Apple's plans are not dedicated.  My own thoughts ... Everything you have already written and discussed: problems with piracy, unprotected Internet payments, low price of tracks, a small Internet market, copyright hemorrhoids ... and the list goes on.  Apparently, while Apple is uninteresting this market.  I don‚Äôt know anything about cooperation with performers and copyright holders.  Maybe there is such a thing. <br><br>  <b>Will there be production in Russia?</b>  Again, the plans are not dedicated, but I'm sure not.  Well, these are not cars ... And our investment climate ... tax regime ... the attitude of the authorities ... continue? <br><br>  <b>Online Store.</b>  <b>Offline store Apple Store ...</b> Also not dedicated ... Someday will definitely be! .. You know, wrote, and realized that he was close to a dangerous line - comments from Apple plans ... let's step back a little from the line.  I will say my purely private considerations.  Both of these formats are the highest stage of development of the Apple channel in the country, the Apple infrastructure in the country, the importance and market share of Apple in the country.  In Russia, all this grows and develops.  So we are waiting ... Opening an office is a significant step along the way.  But all this is definitely not tomorrow.  You see, 2 years have already passed unnoticed. <br><br>  <b>About the tablet I do not know anything at all.</b> <br><br>  <b>Why novelties reach for a long time.</b>  It is not, or rather not quite.  Let's figure it out.  All (!) Of the novelties first of all go to the American market, constituting 55-60% of the total sales volume of Apple.  Then - to Europe.  Often, new products are shipped initially in small batches - the demand often exceeds the most ambitious forecasts.  In Russia, delivery for more than two years by air.  It takes one to two weeks for delivery from the factory, customs clearance and delivery to the Dihaus warehouse.  New products require a set of certificates, their acquisition takes some time!  From the warehouse of Dehaus they come in retail, to dealers, in APRs.  The longest delivery to retail outlets is at retail, the fastest is at dealers and APRs.  Particularly urgent deliveries of new products are on the fast shipment program, and Apple itself determines the recipients for such shipments.  As a rule, it is only APR.  ReStor stores in Moscow always receive fast shipment.  I recommend to place pre-orders! <br><br>  Are there any preference for large networks?  Yes, and first of all by Apple.  The corporation works like this all over the world - after its own channels, priority is given to large retail and APRs.  This is a matter of expediency.  This achieves the widest possible coverage of the target consumer audience.  Moreover, in general, all manufacturers producing goods for consumer markets work in this way. <br><br>  <b>About the "cut the loot until it has flown."</b>  Let's start with the author - with Evgeny Chichvarkin himself.  As stated more than once, Euroset's EBITDA was no more than 2% in recent years.  EBITDA is profit without taking into account taxes, interest on loans and depreciation.  Roughly estimate - 2% of 3 billion annual turnover - is 60 million dollars.  A loan of 800 million. Let at the "divine" rate of 12% per annum - 96 million per year, one percent!  Taxes ... let 1% of the turnover - another 30 million. Depreciation ... well, 5 thousand salons, 20 thousand. Property for the salon and 3-year accelerated depreciation - another 35 million. Total - plus 60 million, minus 160 million, to chop- then?  And all for the sake of you to buy the phone yourself! <br><br>  Now another problem - <b>about ECS</b> .  From 2004 to 2008, our Apple sales grew 15-fold - almost double each year.  Estimate (well, take the fattest margin to match my universal greed !!).  Well, let's say I sold 100% a year. After all expenses, I earned 10% of net money (no one earns so much, but I'm the greedier of all!).  Taking into account the returned turnaround I have 110. And you need to buy twice as much for the new year.  Where to get another 90?  Credit.  Well, even at 12% per annum (on average more, but let).  This is 11 from 90. So, the profits of last year have already been eaten ... And to build stores, build shop-in-shops, equip sales points, advance lending to the channel for purchasing goods for sales growth ... Recruitment for growth, expanding the office ... Okay, now we will earn 20 ... Apart from the development-related costs of the above ... But next year again, twice!  Eaten again!  And it is impossible to delay a single payment to Apple (5 years have not been delayed!) Well, the crisis, sales are falling, costs are falling ... But then the losses eat up the freed money, and exchange differences!  We chop - expenses, not loot!  People on the street, unprofitable stores under closure, do not buy new, sell the old ... Who is easy now ... And so on in a circle.  So, ladies and gentlemen, try to live like this for several years when you start your own business ... <br><br>  <b>Shops in the regions.</b>  Unfortunately, the level of demand and the termination of consumer lending kill this business in the regions.  Even in St. Petersburg, everything is not very good.  For comparison: in Denmark, out of 9 of our stores, 5 sell more to our best troika - European, Atrium and Z-Store in Belarus.  So we will wait, we will see ... As the economy recovers, we will begin to return to the largest of the abandoned cities ... But we will start thinking about this no sooner than in a year. <br><br>  By the way, Internet sales of ReStor and ZetStor make up 8% of offline, that's a lot!  At the same time, we are working through the Internet so far only in Moscow, even in St. Petersburg is unprofitable so far ... <br><br>  <b>Have they stolen equipment in stores?</b>  Yes, they have stolen and will continue to steal.  Even one armed robbery was ... Read the book of Sam Walton, the founder of Wal-Mart.  Thefts are the scourge and integral feature of retail.  They are stealing from us and in Europe. <br><br>  <b>Do I use iTunes myself and how?</b>  Yes, in English, I have a credit card in UK. <br><br>  <b>Am I happy with sales in 2009?</b>  No, they could have more, were reinsured, took a conservative position.  We went through a major restructuring of the business, brand portfolio, team renewal ... Nothing, we catch up in 2010. <br><br>  I am not ready to say for certain categories, but it is obvious that they have gone ‚Äúdown‚Äù - cheap products are more popular than before - MacBooks, aimaks.  The failure of the monitors.  By Mac Pro.  By tacham.  Well, this is understandable and predictable. <br><br>  <b>What will happen to the huge untapped batches of iPhones?</b>  This is a myth, they are not.  Warehouses operators are empty.  We are desperate for anything for the resistor.  Sometimes we get crumbs in the form of several hundred devices that fly away with a whistle, even in Peter is not a helmet, not to mention the regions.  Now they would eat 15-20 thousand iPhones, without bread :) And the distribution of 80 thousand. But no. <br><br>  <b>Is it possible cartel collusion between distributors?</b>  Of course it is possible.  Always, where the number of participants is less than ‚Äúmany‚Äù, cartel collusion is possible.  About this Marx wrote.  Who controls?  Law.  FAS.  You.  And nobody else :) <br><br>  <b>The store in Mega Rostov-on-Don was</b> closed due to the completely unscrupulous attitude of the owners of Mega to tenants.  It is no secret that MEGA did not reduce prices during the crisis, and in the regions most MEGs have poor location and, as a result, poor traffic.  We also left MEGA Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, refused to open in MEGA Samara.  And they even henna.  But the furniture is cheap and varied. <br><br>  <b>Quality sellers in stores ReStor and Zetstor.</b>  The good news is that in 2007 the network became the best in Europe among the APRs in terms of staff quality; in 2008, the average result also jumped far (the best were not identified).  The bad news is that there are weak, dishonest, lazy, illiterate sellers, etc.  There is work to do!  I think it's all the same that our staff is one of the best in Russia among the networks selling electronics. <br><br>  <b>A question about a dishonest game on the market conjuncture.</b>  <b>And also about plans for 2010.</b>  The conjuncture is now rather weak, we do not play on it, but we work quite honestly.  Do not believe the rumors.  In general, when I think about January-February, I want to cry, but if I think about May-July, I want to give up everything and leave for Uryupinsk ... Joke.  We will try in 2010 to repeat 2008. True, part of our sales next year will be no longer ours :). <br><br>  In principle, everything that Apple does in Russia corresponds to your wishes.  Just Venechka can do everything, but can not do everything at once :) <br><br>  If I missed something or did not answer, or there were new questions, start the second wave, I will answer.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Including about dirty specs :) Ready to break into branches. Only with efficiency there can be problems - a lot of business trips and general work :). Only not about mice, keyboards and Wi-Fi access points. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Well, I would also like to wish good luck to Ekaterina Shabanova. My managerial team quite likes her, she is a professional and constructive person, everyone wishes her every success in the position of director of the Apple Russia office. </font></font><br><br> <i><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">(further answers are answered by Petya Semenov (PS) from the resistor and Masha Golenkova (MG) from Dihaus) </font></font></i> <br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why do we need a new sensory mouse?

And besides, in a small number of. I ordered a new mouse, they said that they would bring it in late November-early December. Moreover, they added that there would not be enough for everyone. In Finck it could be bought with a delay of a couple of days, they cannot bring everything to us (St. Petersburg).</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> PS: We can‚Äôt sell more goods before the Apple ships it to Russia. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why do not you sell covers for iPhone 2G? For 3G it is full, and for aluminum - in the afternoon with fire you will not find.</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PS: The lion's share of vendors stopped making covers for 2G more than a year ago. What is presented on their sites is often impossible to buy. Alas, this is the eternal problem of buying accessories for any device discontinued. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Do you sell samples from shop windows and, if so, with what discount?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> PS: It is much more fun for us to sell you not a glass case, but a sealed product from a warehouse. If the product remains in the store in a single copy and the stay in the window left its mark on it, you can always negotiate a discount. In addition, in Moscow there is a specialized apple outlet - re: Store Budenovsky - there is always a large selection of low-cost computers of past lineups and demo copies. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Will you have iTunes gift cards for sale?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">PS: As soon as Apple starts to deliver this product for sale in Russia, we will be happy to start selling them. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When will the delivery from the online store in St. Petersburg work?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> PS: Delivery works not only in St. Petersburg, but throughout Russia. It is only necessary to understand that the logistics center is located in Moscow, and this imposes restrictions on the delivery time. Alternatively, you can order the delivery of goods from the store Z-Store on Nevsky, if this product is there in stock. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For several months, students, including those with ISIC cards, were granted a 10% discount on Apple equipment. How interesting was this discount for students?

The initial price was the fruit of a technical error related to cross-rates, and an error that was not made by us. When it was fixed, the price also changed accordingly. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Update or full version? 10.6 as a distribution kit exists only in one and only full version. The word update appeared in the price lists as a consequence of Apple‚Äôs ideology, which considers Snow Leo to be an update for ‚Äúordinary‚Äù Leopard.</font></font><br><br> <b>      iMac,      ,       ?  -      20"  24" ‚Äî    Store-at-store: ., ,  ‚Ä¶         iMac, mac mini  MacBook   ?</b> <br><br> :    iMac    ,        .       ,     re:Store.         ,       . <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">MG: For my part, I can only confirm that the small amount of new equipment that we received from Apple was promptly shipped to the channel. I think that it really remained mainly in Moscow and St. Petersburg. I hope that closer to NG deliveries will be adjusted and we will be able to please everyone with sufficient availability of new computers from our partners. </font></font><br><br> <b><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Why when watching a movie in QuickTime X, when you press cmd + f (full screen), and then back, the navigation bar goes up?</font></font></b> <br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> PS: I remember the old saying - This is not a bug, this is a feature ...
