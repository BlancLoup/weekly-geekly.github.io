I immediately decided that for the time being I would not withdraw cash in connection with the existing ideas of investing this, so to speak, money. <br><br>  I chose from 2 EPS: Liberty Reserve and Perfect Money.  Of course there are a lot more, but for a start I decided to use the well-known market leaders. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  I started my trip with LR.  A little about the system itself: Officially, the company Liberty Reserve is registered and is actually located in Costa Rica.  The company is protected by an offshore agreement.  Return of payments LR does not support the return of payments, but in the system there is the possibility of anonymous transfer, it‚Äôs a pity that this pleasure costs 75 cents :(. Transaction fee is 1% and cannot be less than 1 cent or more than $ 2.99 and is taken she is from the recipient.

      The most important advantage of the system is the powerful protection of accounts against hacking. <br><br>  The most interesting security system is the so-called PIN code, which can be entered only from the virtual keyboard.  But that's not all, the position of the buttons on this keyboard itself is constantly changing, which gives additional protection from intercepting not only the typing from the keyboard, but also the movement of the mouse. <br><br>  The downside of the system is the inability to replenish the balance and withdraw funds directly: through banks or plastic cards.  You can replenish or withdraw money only through exchangers sites, the list of which is on the site of the system. <br><br>  The next system in my way got Perfect money.  ‚ÄúThe edge of absolute perfection, crowning the global virtual economy, is now represented by an ideal financial institution - Perfect Money, whose target program is to bring financial operations on the Internet to the ideal level.‚Äù - this was the first thing I read on the website page in the ‚ÄúAbout us".  The company is also located in the offshore zone in Panama.  Transfer commission within the system is 0.5%, and the maximum possible commission is not limited in any way, which can be a problem when transferring large amounts of funds.  The system itself supports the purchase of PM via bank transfer, and exchange for other types of electronic currencies.  Approximately 25 sites are official exchangers of this system, which is also a certain guarantee. <br><br>  As a plus, we can note a very good system of protection for a user account, with several levels of protection.  There are additional paid services for greater security.  I liked the translation of the site into 16 languages.  The system really wants to be perfect :). <br><br>  The downside is the same unlimited transfer fee. <br><br>  And so, summing up the above, having considered the market position, we can conclude that LR still occupies a leading position (by the way, I chose it :)), PM is a very pleasant system, and I will probably be using it in the near future. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/71194/">https://habr.com/ru/post/71194/</a></p>
