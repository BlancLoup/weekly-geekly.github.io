    <h4>  Why call in the 21st century </h4><br>  It would seem that there is e-mail, online consultants and various forms of communication on websites - why in such a situation to communicate with potential customers by voice?  The problem is that these instant ways of communication turn out to be far less fast - for example, according to research, email is one of the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/10349547/Email-the-slowest-form-of-customer-service.html">slowest</a> tools for communicating with clients. <br><br>  A phone call is much faster, and in a large number of situations it is much more convenient than electronic correspondence.  And this tool can be extremely effective, you just need to know who and when to call. <br><br><h4>  How to understand who to call: points of engagement </h4><br>  Technological capabilities for data collection and their analytics should be used just to determine which site visitors should be offered to talk on the phone. <br><br>  Obviously, such a proposal will be far from interesting to everyone - in order to identify users who ‚Äúdeserve‚Äù a call more than others, you can use the scheme with the calculation of ‚Äúengagement points‚Äù.  This indicator is used to understand how much the user is interested in the content of the site, you should analyze its behavior on the page. <br><br>  The very concept of engagement depends, among other things, on the type of page - in the case of landing, engagement will be the higher, the more the user has scrolled through this page.  If we are talking about an information site with a large number of pages, then in this case, to measure engagement, we should take into account clicks, visit time, etc. <br><br>  In the course of work on the widget for organizing calls to <a href="http://perezvoni.com/">Perezvoni.com,</a> we analyzed a large number of user actions that affect engagement, and identified nine of the most important of them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/03c/b25/fbb/03cb25fbb3003256f5478b40c46cf7e3.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As mentioned above, for the landing page, the fact that the visitor ‚Äútwirled‚Äù it to the end significantly increases the likelihood of successful conversion.  Equally important is the fact of activity on the page for more than 60 seconds.  Together with the scroll down to the bottom of the page, this is one of the most strongly affecting conversion factors. <br><br>  Positive effect on the conversion and the implementation of transitions to other pages of the site, as well as (activity on the site longer than the average visit time). <br><br>  In addition, one should take into account (in order of decreasing importance) a visit to more than three pages of the site, the intensity of the mouse movement, and the general correspondence of the model of behavior on the site to that shown by customers. <br><br>  In some cases, a visit to a specific page can have the greatest impact on conversion - for example, anyone who got into the product registration basket can be considered extremely important users who should be shown a widget with a call suggestion. <br><br>  You can count your engagement points in real time (and you can check it yourself): the figure below shows the Chrome browser developer console, which shows how the Perezvoni widget analyzes user actions on a page: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/c31/8cf/f94/c318cff947bc81397daf7f1056a882a5.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h4>  What else to consider: behavior scenarios </h4><br>  In addition to determining user involvement, an important role is played by the fact under which conditions this person got on the site.  Here we can distinguish four scenarios in which it makes sense to try to offer the visitor a phone call to answer their possible questions. <br><br><h5>  "Fishing at the entrance" </h5><br>  If a visitor first appeared on the site, but came by the target request, which contains words like ‚Äúbuy‚Äù or hit the page, directly typing its address in the browser line - then such a user should be considered ‚Äúhot‚Äù. <br><br>  If such a person is sufficiently active on the site (does not fall within the ‚Äúbounce rate‚Äù threshold and gains the required number of engagement points), then he can be offered a call ‚Äî if you use the search query that led the person to the site (you can substitute him automatically) This greatly increases conversion.  For example, in the field of travel sites, this approach has increased the conversion by 65%: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/a05/b83/063/a05b8306357828cd8945aff79ac1a1ca.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h5>  Work with someone who is looking for a long time </h5><br>  If a user came to the site not on the ‚Äúhot‚Äù keyword, but after spending some time on the page, scored the required number of points for actions (scrolls, clicks, mouse movement), then it can be attributed to the category of people who have been searching for the necessary information for a long time.  Such a user can offer a call to clarify possible issues. <br><br>  Below is the statistics of one of the online furniture stores - this company shows a widget with a call suggestion to users who have been looking for information on the site for a long time.  Conversion is kept at a good level: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/889/a04/04b/889a0404bb51a44b2dd94db28ee9f8c4.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h5>  "Catching at the exit" </h5><br>  When the user spent some time on the site (higher than the threshold for the ‚Äúbounce rate‚Äù) did not perform the target action and only then decided to leave it, it is logical to try to keep it, showing the offer to call each other to discuss the issues raised or clarify unclear points.  Such a client is almost lost anyway, so even if you can save a few percent of the conversion, this is already a good thing. <br><br>  In the segment of real estate websites a good result was achieved by a company showing a widget with a call proposal to outgoing users.  A message with the text of the form ‚ÄúDid not find the right option?  Let's call you back in 28 seconds and pick up 5-6 apartment options for any budget! ‚ÄùShowed a conversion of more than 11%: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/98e/4d1/525/98e4d15255540a3704c12b48f14338d5.png" alt="image"></a> <br><br><h5>  Work with returning users </h5><br>  Cookie technology makes it easy to understand whether a user has been to the site before.  If this is not his first visit, then it‚Äôs definitely worth concentrating on such a person and trying to sell something to him.  This can be done, for example, by showing a welcome message with a call from the company to save time (it is important not to annoy people and not to show the offer to those who have already seen it during the last visit). <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br>  The combination of the ‚Äúgood old‚Äù methods of business communication, such as telephone calls with sophisticated tools for collecting and analyzing data, can significantly increase the conversion of the site.  Depending on the business segment, conversion from advertising sources using this approach can be increased by 60-70%, which will bring a significant increase in profits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/43d/cf2/fd9/43dcf2fd9eb2b2a7481a347f4edb7056.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In the following publications we will touch upon the topic of growth hacking in more detail and will reveal some of the techniques for increasing conversion using practical examples of real-life cases. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286110/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286110/</a></p>
