  <section class="page js-page"><h1>For 2 years graduates of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology created the largest skype school in Russia</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  According <a href="http://top.rbc.ru/own_business/11/03/2015/54fed5c79a7947851f391e22">to</a> RBC, in just 2 years, Georgiy Soloviev and Khariton Matveyev created the largest online English language school in Russia.  A high level of standardization of education was achieved, but for this it was necessary to take a risk and invest $ 260,000, which, of course, was not available to yesterday's graduates of MIPT. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  It all started with the fact that George Solovyov once noticed the obvious thing: in smaller cities, individual English classes are much cheaper than in Moscow.  So he came up with the idea to create a Skype-school of English, which in 2012 he offered to classmates: Khariton Matveyev, Denis Smetnev and Andrey Yaunzem. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9da/139/0d7/9da1390d792647d8b68ce84d7e72277f.png">

      At the initial stage, 400,000 rubles was invested by the State Fund for the Promotion of the Development of Small Businesses in their project. <br><br>  When new investments were required, Soloviev and Matveyev turned to Alexander Laryanovsky, at that time Yandex International Development Director, who was then learning English.  However, he was very skeptical about his Skype classes. <br><br>  The key moment in relations with Laryanovsky was the moment when he learned that Soloviev and Matveyev received $ 30,000 for 10% of their company Modern Educational Solutions from the British hedge fund GLG Partners.  ‚ÄúI began to respect them,‚Äù recalls Laryanovsky. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/186/635/477/186635477b8603d02db1eda1cfefaab8.jpg" alt="image" width="400"><br><br>  Alexander Laryanovsky invested $ 300,000 in the SkyEng project in October 2013. <br><br>  Reflecting on the further development of the project, entrepreneurs noticed that traditional schools have good teaching methods, but a weak understanding of the integration of the educational process with IT.  On the other hand, educational Internet projects with good design and progressive technologies pay little attention to the observance of teaching standards.  It was decided to combine the advantages of these two types of schools in SkyEng. <br><br>  This was how the virtual practice platform Vimbox was developed, the test version of which was launched last June.  Investments that were required for its development, Laryanovsky estimates at $ 260,000. <br><br>  Vimbox allows you to standardize the learning process, share teaching materials, as well as maintain statistics of lessons and even select a teacher‚Äôs student on the basis of psychological compatibility. <br><br>  In addition, a special monitoring system gives methodologists the opportunity to observe the progress of the lesson, to help and adjust the teacher in real time. <br><br>  The SkyEng Methodists provide teachers with pre-prepared recommendations and check that they work in accordance with the lesson plan. <br><br>  While Vimbox is used to conduct 60% of SkyEng lessons.  The creators of the platform are planning in six months to increase this figure to 90%. <br><br>  Currently, 160 teachers work in SkyEng, 60% of them are Russian speakers, and most of them live in the regions.  A teacher earns 40‚Äì50 thousand rubles a month, subject to an eight-hour daily load.  The number of students reaches 1,600. One 50-minute lesson with a Russian-speaking teacher costs 630-670 rubles, and with a native speaker - 1330-1470 rubles. <br><br>  SkyEng sales margin, according to Laryanovsky, reaches 20%.  Last year's revenue increased 4 times and reached 39.5 million rubles. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/286590/">https://habr.com/ru/post/286590/</a></p>
