To create an idea you need to be different ... <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/4f5/b24/500/4f5b2450068f4a87e6cb1ef214b0e7d6.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h4>  Personality awareness </h4><br>  The moment when you realize that everything can collapse and you begin to see yourself apart from others, to see that something is better, something is worse, something else, in other words you realize yourself not as a society, but as a separate part.  So the fuller the understanding of your ‚ÄúI‚Äù and that I am different, the more it develops the quality of a leader and self-esteem, which stimulates the generation of unique thoughts and ideas, since you stop following the rules and go beyond the boundaries.  In my childhood I had a very serious injury, and so in my case it happened very abruptly when I just saw that I‚Äôm supposedly suffering now, while others are fine, that is, it seems that there‚Äôs nothing special about it, but before that it‚Äôs not was attached.

    <h4>  Do not recognize the authorities </h4><br>  Recognizing someone as your authority, you recognize that this person is better than you, thereby driving into the framework of their abilities.  In other words, if you, for example, recognize Einstein as your idol and authority, you thereby impose a pattern of his life on your own, in other words, you recognize that everything should be so and not otherwise, which limits your ideas and thoughts. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  We are the environment </h4><br>  Those who we are, this is where we are.  Without trying an apple, we will never know its taste.  Everything acts on each other equally, if you are constantly in a technical environment, then you are more competent in this topic than a man of art, but on the contrary the artist knows more about you about art.  That is what we do and where we are forms the most.  Due to the fact that everything is interconnected in the world, firstly, you need to watch what you do, who your friends are and where you are and maximum time to do what you like, and secondly, always expand your horizons and be interested in distant topics, opportunities to travel, communicate with different people, participate in different events.  Knowledge gives an advantage over others, therefore the better they are, the better you are.  In other words, a person who spends time in the library and studies is better than someone who burns life on the bench, due to the fact that his environment is more developed. <br><br><h4>  Dream and be romantic </h4><br>  The idea is the most important thing; everything is born from it.  Incarnation is a matter of technology.  Ideas are directly dependent on your knowledge, so the more extensive they are, the more ideas you will have.  Therefore, once again, you need to expand the horizons as much as possible.  Take a great interest in fiction, be interested in the thoughts and ideas of others, in the aggregate it will all give you your own ideas.  The idea is like the first piece taken from there, the second one from here, the third one from somewhere else combined together.  And most importantly, you should never be afraid to embody ideas, even if they fail, at least you will try, besides you should always strive for beauty, not profit.  That is, the goal should not be to benefit from the idea, but to enjoy the beauty of its embodiment. <br><br><h4>  Ask, ask, ask </h4><br>  Never hesitate to ask questions, even if they are absurd and cause laughter.  It is much better to ask a question and clarify the decision once and for all, than to be ashamed of and remain with an unsolved problem. <br><br><h4>  Try not to have a business with friends </h4><br>  Cases can not be based on a bias.  Business and business is like a game of chess, you cannot sacrifice a feznem for a pawn here, simply because pawn is your friend.  In the sense that when you do business with friends, a sense of friendship also imposes an imprint on the outcome of the case.  That is, if you or your friend mow, an attempt at criticism will have a personal character, which will lead to a quarrel.  A friendship based on business is better than a friendship based business (Rockefeller). <br><br><h4>  Use the notebook </h4><br>  For me, this is one of the basics.  I use <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notemaster-notes-images-synced/id297921531%3Fmt%3D8">NoteMaster</a> for <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/notemaster-notes-images-synced/id297921531%3Fmt%3D8">iphone</a> .  But the point is not in the program, but in the fact that it is always with me.  That is, for example, I can wake up in the middle of the night and write down some thought or task.  The fact is that, depending on the environment, we think differently, because everything around us has an influence.  In the sense that if, for example, I study mathematics all day, then our brain begins to think mathematically and generates corresponding ideas based on this, which will be different than if we are engaged in history or psychology all day.  The fact is that our brain just works differently depending on the situation, and often your ideas will seem absurd later as the work of the brain is rebuilt.  But the fact is that an idea is a kind of logical chain, and it cannot be bad if you came up with it, which means you have seen some kind of logical chain, and even if it will later seem erroneous.  So the point is that you need to write down all the ideas and thoughts, since you different ideas are useful for different issues and settings, that is, what you come up with once, will come in handy in some specially suitable setting for this idea.  As for the tasks, I often forget what needs to be done.  Therefore, if you write down tasks, you will never forget them and you will clearly see what to do. <br><br><h4>  Money is a means, it is not a goal. </h4><br>  You need to have money to create things, and not to create things to have money.  This is very important, the point is not to earn as much as possible, but to create something useful, so never make it your goal and desire to make money, strive to create something beautiful and useful, in this case the financial side will come by itself, as confirmation You are on the right track. <br><br><h4>  Happiness is an indicator, it is not a goal. </h4><br>  You do not need to strive for happiness, we experience happiness when it is something that is right, as it seems to us.  Therefore, you just need to create and create, and happiness is an indication that you are on the right track. <br><br><h4>  Art and science </h4><br>  Everything in the world is interconnected.  If you are doing something technical, then be interested in art, if you are an artist, then be interested in technical sciences.  I belong to a technical group, and when I listen to classical music or look at artistic masterpieces, I see a certain dependence, an algorithm.  The artist or the composer created this algorithm without knowing it, on the basis of feelings.  For example, when I hear music, I interpret a melody as a set of waves and separate parts working together, and the connection and algorithm by which principle they work together often gives me inspiration for applying this algorithm in writing code.  Well, something like 11-22-11-22, 11-222-11-222 are different dependencies, and there are also dependencies in music and art. <br><br><h4>  Everything tends to balance </h4><br>  Nothing comes from outside and goes nowhere.  That is, all that is, there is a purpose, so it is very important to understand the cause and effect, not the prerequisites, namely, the cause, or rather its root, in order to properly cause decisions.  That is, it is necessary to solve the root of the problem, and not its consequences, before taking actions you need to be aware of the source of the difficulties. <br><br><h4>  The more factors taken into account, the better </h4><br>  The more factors you take into account, the more accurate the result.  Therefore, when making decisions, it is necessary to take into account as many sources as possible which may affect the result.  It works like a computer, if it‚Äôs just a calculator, then you know by one hundred percent that by pressing 2 multiply by 2 there will be four, but the more complex the system becomes, the more processes you need to take into account.  That is, in any system it is possible to calculate the correct solution for 100%, the only question is how many factors must be taken into account.  The less is taken into account the less accurate the result. <br><br><h4>  Don't mess around </h4><br>  Focus on the main and important points, do not think about the little things.  The less you think about different things the better.  That is, you need to concentrate on as few different tasks as possible.  Since the transition from one task to another always requires a restructuring of thinking, which takes time and energy. <br><br><h4>  Do not leave unresolved moments. </h4><br>  If you see an error, do not postpone it for later, check it right away.  Roughly speaking, seeing an error and postponing it for later you commit 3 or even 4 actions (you see an error, postpone for later, return to an error, remember what it is about), and when you decide at once, the last 2 stages are removed, which saves time. <br><br><h4>  Finish it to the end </h4><br>  If you started something, finish it to the end.  It is better to spend more time on deciding whether to do it than to rush to execute and quit halfway.  If you undertake to do something, it should mean that the possible options were weighed in advance and the decision was made to execute.  In other words, if you come from something, then there should be no way back. <br><br><h4>  Think of </h4><br>  The most important thing is to plan, take into account the greatest number of factors, so before you do something you need to spend as much time on planning, think until all steps and all possible difficulties are calculated and foreseen, which ultimately saves time and energy on patching patches.  For example, I sometimes just sit and think / plan for several hours and do nothing else. <br><br><h4>  Use the latest developments </h4><br>  Always try to use everything new.  Even if you are used to some old program, or the old foundations, you should always try the new one.  Having knowledge and skills in a certain area, the study of something updated will take a short time.  For example, always have the latest versions of the programs used, because updating them does not change the structure of the system, which means you need a few minutes to get into the updates, but the benefits of the innovations will be more. <br><br><h4>  Monitor the process </h4><br>  You need to control the whole project from the beginning to the end, at least to understand how it all works, if some part is missed, it will eventually cause problems, since you will make the wrong decisions due to lack of knowledge. <br><br><h4>  Do not be afraid of radical changes and failures. </h4><br>  Only radical measures can succeed, let it be 9 failures and 1 success, but this success will cover them with interest. <br><br><h4>  The truth is what you say. </h4><br>  It doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs true or not, whether it‚Äôs good or bad, it all depends on how you bring it up.  From all you can make candy and vice versa. <br><br><h4>  Be tougher and rougher </h4><br>  I do not urge to drink, smoke and swear.  The fact is that just do not need to go wherever you are not asked.  You do not need to offer your help or your services if you are not asked for it, unless you see certain goals in this, because they simply will not appreciate it, because, in principle, you will not be asked about it, if you need to be asked.  In the sense that if you see some other people's problem and know how to solve it, but you are not asked for help, then you don‚Äôt have to go there, focus better on your affairs. <br><br><h4>  Communicate with those who are better than you </h4><br>  Again, here is the question of balancing.  That is, if you are competent in some matter and communicate with a person who does not really understand here, then in fact you do not benefit from this, only a waste of time and, on the contrary, your opponent from this benefit. <br><br><h4>  Never say that it is too, I can not, I do not know </h4><br>  Some psychological tests have questions from a number of how many people are easier to control 5 or 5000?  The correct answer is the same.  The point is that the input and output data do not matter, it is in the algorithm, that is, in the approach.  You just need to properly organize the work and it does not matter what data you operate.  Also with the questions "I can not" and "I do not know."  If you are a leader, then you can‚Äôt say that.  Firstly, because if you are in charge, it means you know everything at all, in the sense that if you are hesitating or saying ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know‚Äù the question of the subordinate, then the subordinate loses credibility to you.  Secondly, ‚ÄúI can't‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don't know‚Äù are relative concepts.  That is, for example, to the question ‚ÄúCan you fly a plane?‚Äù Correctly answer ‚ÄúYes, if I pass a flight school.‚Äù  The point is to understand the real connection. <br><br><h4>  Have ego and high self esteem </h4><br>  Even if it does not correspond to your real status, the point here is that if you position yourself as saying ‚ÄúI know a lot‚Äù, then people will try to reproach you at any convenient moment when you make a mistake, and accordingly understanding this will encourage you to make possible fewer errors.  A very important point, even if you see that you transcend a person, even if in everything, and you are 100% sure about it, never insult and belittle him, never put yourself higher than others, even if you are actually better than others.  The fact is that there is a self-defense reflex, no one will ever admit that he is worse than you.  Therefore, if you try to impose your opinion with an aggression, it will not work, even if the person himself realizes that he is wrong, he will never tell you that. <br><br><h4>  Keep the weak </h4><br>  Always support those who have problems and those who are weaker than others.  For them, your support has an order of magnitude greater importance than for a person who is strong without you.  Therefore, if you have helped the weak, for him it is of great importance and he will give you even greater returns, since for him it is important.  If you support a strong person, not only does this mean little to him, moreover, he may think that you are doing it to get a benefit, in which case the result will be the opposite. <br><br><h4>  Take responsibility </h4><br>  If you are afraid to take responsibility, you can never be a leader.  You need to be able to make decisions, even if they may be wrong.  The point is that you need to understand what this benefit can be and what it may threaten.  It is better to make a wrong decision than not at all. <br><br><h4>  Do not leave unresolved moments. </h4><br>  Everything should have a beginning and an end, so when you set a task for yourself or to someone that everything should be arranged in such a way that no questions can arise.  Firstly, the task should be the simpler the better, in the sense that it should not touch on various topics as possible.  For example, ‚ÄúEnter today in such and such a shop and buy such and such bread‚Äù and ‚ÄúBuy bread‚Äù.  In the second variant, there may be many questions (Where? When? Which), so you need to try so that secondary issues do not arise when setting the task. <br><br><h4>  Through hardship to the stars </h4><br>  Abstain from as many things as possible and suffer as much as possible.  Roughly speaking, the meaning of human existence is creation.  That is the ideal option when you do nothing except create something.  But since the world is not perfect, we have to reckon with this.  This is especially true for your feelings and emotions.  Try to refrain from women and feelings as much as possible.  This also applies to alcohol, tobacco and other things.  For example, I do not drink, do not smoke and vegan.  But once a month I can drink a glass of vodka or beer, and I do it as a counterbalance to the existing problems.  That is, for example, if I have any problems that will fall down on me, in order to compensate for the negative mood from the problems with a positive mood of alcohol, in other words, for the sake of this balance, I will return myself to normal again.  That is, it is not necessary to do this for no reason, and the question is not health or something, but the fact that there is simply no reason for it, roughly speaking, people begin to drink and smoke from problems, but if you control everything, there will be no problems.  The wiser a person is, the less things he needs.  As for suffering, this is often mentioned in religion, Buddhism.  The point here is that suffering stimulates creation.  Roughly speaking, if you have no problems, then there is nothing to solve.  And if they are, then it makes you grow.  Labor made a man.  So, suffering is meant to impose on oneself a limited order in order to artificially stimulate development in oneself in order to overcome the created difficulties.  Therefore, when you limit yourself to something, you stimulate yourself to create. <br><br><h4>  Conclusion </h4><br>  The leader of any project should be better than others, both visually and in fact.  The more unusual you are, and accordingly, the more versatile your knowledge, the more influence it has on others.  There is a direct dependence here, because a person sees the lack of this knowledge from him and begins to respect you and show interest, for the reason that he can get this knowledge from you.  Therefore, the more different knowledge you have, the better you understand the surrounding (since everything in the world is interconnected) processes, and therefore you understand more than others, and as a result you know and know what others do not know. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/148307/">https://habr.com/ru/post/148307/</a></p>
