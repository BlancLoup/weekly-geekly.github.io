I continue the series of articles devoted to the Nokia N900. <br><br>  What will be discussed this time?  This time I will tell you how to ‚Äútame‚Äù the purchased N900, sometimes ‚Äúrecruits‚Äù have questions (how to add contacts, how to set up the Internet ...). <br>  In this article, I will try to explain in a popular way how and what to set up, so that everything works as in the promo video <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/nokia/82319/">from my previous article</a> :-) <br><br>  For example, we have such a package (the photo is taken from <a href="http://www.prlog.org/10472013-brand-new-nokia-n900-32gb-factory-unlocked.html">www.prlog.org/10472013-brand-new-nokia-n900-32gb-factory-unlocked.html</a> , tried to take your photo to portray the unpacking process, that didn‚Äôt work, therefore I give this photo :-)). <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/288/16d/e0a/28816de0a211f8218c16d90618015066.jpg" alt="image">

      The N900, which does not have at its disposal, can simply see and evaluate the platform using small screencasts and draw conclusions regarding its functionality and usability (although I personally insist that before making any conclusions, you should definitely walk with this device of day 2 -3) <br><br>  Let's start in order (see the manual under the cut). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  1. We transfer contacts (perhaps also a calendar). </h3><br><br>  One of the most painful topics when switching from telephone to telephone is the transfer of contacts.  I remember when I switched to the iPhone (sorry, again it is omnipresent, but this is my story, nothing can be done), then I had to fill in everything with my hands.  At that time, the iPhone could not copy contacts even from a SIM card. <br><br>  With the N900 it turned out not so difficult.  There is a huge pile of all possible ways. <br>  <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Sync">Here is a link to WiKi on maemo.org regarding this issue.</a>  It describes another method that I did not mention here - via the SyncML protocol via http, using <a href="http://maemo.org/packages/view/syncevolution/">SyncEvolution</a> .  Here is a list of <a href="http://syncevolution.org/documentation/compatibility">supported services</a> , they include <a href="http://www.ovi.com/">OVI.com</a> . <br><br>  Let's go in order. <br><br><h5>  All contacts you have on the SIM card: </h5><br>  Open the address book, open the main menu and click "Get contacts".  In the drop-down menu, select the item "Copy from Sim-card." <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdDm4YizkZk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhTNg1Eav8HjtIzPZP4IoTQY5gIjA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Contacts on another Nokia phone. </h5><br>  Open the address book, open the main menu and click "Get contacts".  In the drop-down menu, select the item "Sync from another device." <br>  The Import Wizard appears.  Here you have the opportunity to keep both devices synchronized with each other, transfer contacts or simply accept contacts. <br>  It is also possible to synchronize not only contacts, but also saves and tasks in the calendar and notes in the calendar. <br>  The transfer procedure is reduced to searching and ‚Äúpairing‚Äù devices via bluetooth and waiting about 1 minute (I have 160 contacts somewhere). <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/z2TQiOW7Twc%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgAE_Lwym2Ck-Xwl9ju58WCVkk-gQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Contacts on another phone, not Nokia. </h5><br>  Here you can copy everything on Sim and then import, as it was said in the first method. <br><br><h5>  If you have contacts on Ovi. </h5><br>  Open the address book, open the main menu and click "Get contacts".  In the drop-down menu, select the item "Import contacts from a new account." <br>  We select ‚ÄúOvi by Nokia‚Äù, enter our registration records there and get contacts. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/MbmxdoCk-jk%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhilFqmj66bxm7NxwGLmAo_X4AcG-A" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  If contacts you have on google. </h5><br>  Use Mail for exchange.  <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Sync">Described in</a> more detail <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Sync">in WiKi</a> .  The point is that Google provides the same interface as MS Exchange, and it is enough to specify the following data: <br>  name: your e-mail address <br>  e-mail: your e-mail address <br>  password: mailbox password <br>  domain: empty <br>  server: m.google.com <br><br>  the rest is left by default.  If an error occurs during synchronization, delete all calendar items on the N900 and try again.  Judging by the <a href="http://talk.maemo.org/showthread.php%3Ft%3D35136">reviews, everything works on-cheers</a> . <br><br>  There is also a <a href="http://www.nuevasync.com/">utility - nuevasync</a> , which is easy to install and its free version is quite suitable for synchronizing your calendar and contacts with Google.  It is very easy to install and use. <br><br><h5>  If you have contacts in Outlook (Express) under Windows. </h5><br>  Just use ActiveSync. <br><br><h5>  If contacts are in your Address book under Mac OS. </h5><br>  Use the plugin for iSync, download the plugin here: <a href="https://garage.maemo.org/projects/n900isyncplugin/">garage.maemo.org/projects/n900isyncplugin</a> .  Caution!!!  the plugin is ‚Äúhomemade‚Äù and no one gives you any guarantees.  To protect yourself, make a backup. <br><br><h5>  If you have contacts in vCard format. </h5><br>  Open the address book, open the main menu and click "Get contacts".  In the drop-down menu, select the item "Import Contacts". <br>  There are two options: import a file or folder with contact files.  Select the desired item, select the path and ready. <br><br><h5>  If contacts you have in Microsoft Exchange. </h5><br>  Use Mail for Exchange. <br>  <a href="http://wiki.maemo.org/Mail_For_Exchange_(MfE)_Heartbeat_and_FAQ">Here is a wiki on this topic.</a> <br>  You can get through from ‚ÄúNastrokraya‚Äù -&gt; ‚ÄúSynchronization with Exchange‚Äù. <br>  Also here <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google%2BMobile/thread%3Ftid%3D5f92340e8dea5ed7%26hl%3Den">www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Mobile/thread?tid=5f92340e8dea5ed7&amp;hl=en</a> you can find a way to synchronize your calendar and contacts with the google service via Sync with Exchange. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/vivQTMf4A84%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgzwg3V1ji1M_-e2m0ojaokXBz1Pg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  Using Nokia PC Suit. </h5><br>  Under Windows, there is an official synchronization path - <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/download-software/pc-suites">Nokia PC Suite</a> .  It allows you to synchronize almost everything and works via SyncML protocol via USB and Bluetooth, but alas, not by IP. <br>  Exhaustive documentation can be found on the <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/download-software/pc-suites/how-to">official product support page</a> . <br><br>  Additionally <a href="http://www.macsthatwork.com/blog/2009/12/syncing-n900-with-mac-definitive-guide.html">, here is a</a> detailed guide for Mac users. <br><br>  Everything, my fantasy is over :-), I hope this is enough to synchronize my contacts. <br><br><h3>  2. Collect all protocols in a bunch !!! </h3><br>  As I said before, the N900 is the first communicator that I personally (since my personal opinion) can call a communicator.  The first device that transparently integrates all protocols together, as text and voice services.  Moreover, the protocols can be supplemented with plug-ins.  Currently all popular protocols are supported, from GSM, Skype, SIP to Twitter and Facebook chat.  The beauty lies in the fact that it doesn't matter to me where they call me from Skype or from another phone or from Google - the call comes as usual.  <s>The main stumbling block</s> is the contact entity, or rather the contact and its accounts in the protocols used. <br>  Or I want to let you call a certain number.  I open the phone dialing panel and enter the phone number and with one touch I choose in what way to call me (which voice account to use).  In general, you need to touch, you will not describe and you will not tell. <br>  Here is my little video. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ryB8uVcK-44%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiut04ygWyeWDOMM2qTUZt7TN6q3w" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  Here is a nice intro demo on this topic: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/30kPxiyzrmI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhoj16TahH5MVzGM5YJ11FYPcKvEQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  But before that you need to add these same protocols.  This is done easily.  At the same time, you need to activate calls from Skype to regular phones and integrate all contacts.  Vobschem something like that. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/0xeaiZ38RjI%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgqonveWhqnvxYVu4EnLybs_ARI6Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  We include maemo repository, it is useful for installing the necessary applications. <br><br><h3>  3. Turn on the maemo.org repository and set up Internet and Wifi connections. </h3><br>  You also need to slightly change the gprs connection.  For some reason, the settings for WAP come from my MTS machine.  Since this record can not be removed and you can not add another connection, then there is a little need to conjure.  The first option is to install the fAPN application and add a new packet connection in it.  The second option is to change the settings of the WAP connection so that it becomes GPRS. <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/VtRNdVHfxN8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhh6_9MS1NNr7bVxJXhFLWQeuheX5Q" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  4. Making contacts more visual, importing photos, birthdays, etc. from Twitter and Facebook </h3><br>  When you connect accounts of different services, for example GTalk or Skype, all your interlocutors are transferred to contacts with all the available information (photos, birthdays), and later combining different accounts of the same person together, you get the ‚Äúcombined‚Äù information on it: -).  But sometimes it may be that this is not enough.  This tool extends this functionality to collect information from two more popular services. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d50/8cc/4e1/d508cc4e1d99ed3cc1d240608e74baab.png" alt="image"><br>  Hermes is in the standard repository and allows you to match contacts from your address book with contacts from Facebook and Twitter and, if necessary, import photos and birthdays. <br><br><h3>  5. We share the impression with the world. </h3><br>  In the N900, you can simply share a photo or video that you just shot on all (well, almost all) of your social networks with just one button.  Out of the box is Flickr and Ovi.  Virtually all others can be found in the ovi store for free.  Here is a list of some: <br><ul><li>  FTP Upload Sharing Plugin. </li><li>  YouTube Video Sharing Plugin. </li><li>  Twitter Media Sharing Plugin. </li><li>  Blogger Media Sharing Plugin. </li><li>  Evernote Media Sharing Plugin. </li><li>  Pixelpipe Sharing Plugin (He, in turn, can share a lot where). </li><li>  Sharing Plugin to Photobucket. </li><li>  Sharing plugin for TinyPic. </li><li>  yfrog media sharing plugin. </li></ul><br>  An impressive list, isn't it?  If something is missing, then a lot of various other plug-ins for sharing can be found on the maemo.org repositories (development and testing), at the same time and test :-) <br>  Here is a nice demonstration of how this function works: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/tGXAVLSyc_E%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhhh2PclocQU6_xf82oexIyYKy8VzQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h3>  6. Sync music? </h3><br>  Well, there are two ways.  The easiest way is to connect the device as USB storage and copy music and video to any place, the media player will find them :-) To keep the devices synchronized with a specific folder, you can use special utilities: from cron, rsync to goodsync and other utilities for synchronization. <br><br>  If your library is stored in iTunes, you can use the <a href="http://www.markspace.com/gogadget/nokia/index.html">GoGadget</a> paid program. <br><img src="http://www.markspace.com/gogadget/nokia/images/goGadget-nokian900-Ringtones-sm.png" alt="image"><br>  Very functional utility, works under Mac and Windows.  Synchronizes photos, videos, documents and files.  Allows you to create ringtones.  So, if your grandmother needs to synchronize with the N900, then I advise you to use this utility, it is not expensive ($ 20).  And this is by no means an advertisement, I just really liked it. <br><br>  If you live under Mac, then everything is simple.  Nokia Multimedia Transfer is a utility for synchronizing your Mac with the N900.  As well as GoGadget, it synchronizes both music and photos and videos, and even bookmarks in the browser.  Download for free <a href="http://europe.nokia.com/support/download-software/nokia-multimedia-transfer">here</a> . <br><img src="http://europe.nokia.com/EUROPE_NOKIA_COM_3/Get_Support/Software/Nokia_Media_Transfer/images/Nokia_Multimedia_Transfer1.png" alt="image"><br><br><br>  But for Windows users, there is also an alternative - this is the iTunes Agent.  This agent tracks the connection of devices via USB and adds it to iTunes, not as it does for an iPod / iPhone, but as a playlist.  The main slogan of the application is ‚ÄúiTunes is not only for iPod !!‚Äù.  I did not try it, but my friends responded positively.  For example, this ‚Äúdevice playlist‚Äù can be tied to a smart playlist (for example, the newest or most rated) and always have new music on the device :-). <br>  Download <a href="http://ita.sourceforge.net/">here</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d23/5e3/34d/d235e334d5bb44541f766114c3d8d66a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  As you can see with the synchronization of music, video and photos everything is in order. <br><br><h3>  7. What else can be useful? </h3><br>  (All the applications below can be delivered directly from the application manager). <br>  I also advise you to put this application here - <b>Friend Status IM Status Aggregator</b> - it allows you to see the subscriber's accessibility by all its protocols in the address book (for example, in Skype it is online and in ICQ it is turned off). <br>  <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/friendstatus/">maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/friendstatus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/214/e6a/b05/214e6ab0598abac0e54c28181ecbdc24.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Conversation Inbox Desktop Widget</b> is a very useful thing, it shows incoming messages on all available protocols right on the desktop (by name you can guess :-)). <br>  Available from here: <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/conversations-inbox-widget/">maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/conversations-inbox-widget</a> <br><img src="http://static.maemo.org/static/d/d5c27ca2d86c11dea6d157637711c3e2c3e2_screenshot-20091123-221300.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Extra Decoders Support</b> - adds support for some protocols (AC-3 to video, Vorbis OGG and FLAC, Musepack, Flash video, RealMedia, container Matroska, MPEG2-TS).

For some reason, they forgot to include this program in the standard package (Apple also included this utility only in the third version of its OS for phones).

So as not to go bankrupt on mobile communications, I strongly advise you to put it on.  If you feel sorry for the space on your desktop, it has a compact mode, it will take very little space :-).  There is a similar thing to display IP, called - <b>Personal IP Address</b> . <br>  <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/personal-gprs-mon/">maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/personal-gprs-mon</a> <br>  <a href="http://static.maemo.org/static/1/11ceadfcc3e011deb6c5eb11517c7b767b76_personal_dataplan_monitor">static.maemo.org/static/1/11ceadfcc3e011deb6c5eb11517c7b767b76_personal_dataplan_monitor</a> <br><br>  <b>GPodder Podcast Client</b> - for those who listen to podcasts.  I listen and this program has all the necessary functionality for me. <br>  <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/gpodder/">maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/gpodder</a> <br><img src="http://static.maemo.org/static/7/71c8c78eada511de8589d70d720dbb92bb92_gpodder-main" alt="image"><br><br>  T <b>ouchSearch</b> is a convenient way to search with a single click on the desktop.  I use it regularly, I strongly advise everyone. <br>  <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/touchsearch/">maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/touchsearch</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1da/408/c3d/1da408c3d6f1a09c099c0e145ef24836.jpg" alt="image"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/713/333/4e9/7133334e9148f09c356505f9f36bae92.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Fbreader</b> - well, this is for those who like to read books :-), I have a Kindle DX, so I don‚Äôt need this program.  But I know that some people read directly from phones, PDAs and so on.  The program itself does not require submission, it is known in its circles.  Who hears the first time, I can say that it supports a lot of different formats and has everything that is necessary for comfortable reading. <br>  <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/fbreader/">maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/fbreader</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/37a/520/abe/37a520abe83c778d963fdbc71d068ff0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Pidgin Protocols Plugin For Conversations And Contacts</b> - adds a bunch of missing protocols for standard address book and dialogs: AIM, Facebook, GaduGadu, Groupwise, ICQ, MSN, QQ, Sametime and Yahoo.  I think because of the popularity of ICQ with us, it will be useful to many. <br>  <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/account-plugin-haze/">maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/account-plugin-haze</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cd4/00f/00e/cd400f00eed8e137c23de83c6ed017df.png" alt="image"><br><br>  P <b>anucci Resuming Audiobook And Podcast Player</b> - I use it to listen to audiobooks, as it remembers the position at which it stopped last time.  It makes sense to use until May, in May I plan to roll out my own crafts for these needs.  Since I read audio books often, I don‚Äôt really like this program. <br>  <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/panucci/">maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/panucci</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/db3/863/196/db3863196442fbfb7923cfc312a85402.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>PyGTKEditor</b> - all Maemo users have a long-known tool for writing source code directly on the device, with the help of this useful thing, I study Python on the go.  To start an application written by Python, you only need to press one button :-). <br>  <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/pygtkeditor/">maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/pygtkeditor</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f0c/4dd/c79/f0c4ddc79ca4bb9aa31fa7efcc29a890.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>MaStory</b> - allows you to write blogs directly on the device, supports the main blogging engines: Wordpress, Blogger, Livejournal and Drupal.  I personally do not use it, but I think it will be useful for avid bloggers. <br>  There is an integration with photo services: Flickr and Picasa. <br>  <a href="http://maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/mastory/">maemo.org/downloads/product/Maemo5/mastory</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f64/2d5/28f/f642d528f0d66f77b874f9f713242ba3.png" alt="image"><br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  Fuuuuh, spit it all out for you right in the same breath.  I hope the set proposed by me has satisfied most of your needs and saved you from having to dig yourself in case something has become incomprehensible.  I wrote it in a state in which I was just overwhelmed with enthusiasm.  Why?  Yes, because the hands just itch to add their own what-thread (I thought how to spell the word "thread", I decided, like "something" through a hyphen :-)).  But with the next article together we will start to do it :-). <br><br>  What can be added to this all?  Well, firstly, I did not feel the power and charms of the N900, until the day was like him.  The second thing that dumbfounded me is that this is really the first communicator that I see.  Some people say that the N900 is a computer in the first place, and then a phone.  So I would not agree with this statement.  Just in the first place - this is a phone that uses the capabilities of modern technologies to the fullest extent and makes it convenient and transparent for the user.  I started calling my grandmother abroad more often using Skipe-out :-). <br><br>  Well, if you are not impressed with the list of applications in the standard maemo.org repository, then connect the repository of applications in development or being tested: <br><br>  <b>Fremantle Extras-testing</b> <br><pre>  <i>deb http://repository.maemo.org/extras-testing/ fremantle free non-free</i> <i>
</i>  <i>deb-src http://repository.maemo.org/extras-testing/ fremantle free</i> </pre><br><br>  <b>Fremantle Extras-devel</b> <br><pre>  <i>deb http://repository.maemo.org/extras-devel/ fremantle free non-free</i> <i>
</i>  <i>deb-src http://repository.maemo.org/extras-devel/ fremantle free</i> </pre><br><br>  Here is a short guide on how to add a new repository: <br>  You need to open the "Application Manager" (the one where we used the Maemo.org repository in previous videos).  Open the main menu and select the item ‚ÄúApplication Catalogs‚Äù, in the appeared menu-list of repositories press the ‚Äúcreate‚Äù button and fill in the appropriate fields. <br>  Here is a small video: <br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDNdXDPeV9M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700043,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhgoN1WM7rRYBMlUMhgzasYW2a56Sw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  And a photo example of filling in the fields: <br><img src="http://www.nokian900applications.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Extra-testing.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And get to know the world further, there are many interesting and developing projects, and if something doesn't work in your application, please do not hesitate and do not be lazy, but write to the developers about the bug found in the <a href="http://bugs.maemo.org/">bug-tracker</a> .  This will help make the world a better place :-). <br><br>  Here are some extra-devel projects that might interest you: <br><br>  <b><a href="https://garage.maemo.org/projects/abiword/">Abiword</a></b> is the port of the <a href="http://www.abisource.com/">popular text editor</a> on Maemo.  Very functional. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/957/373/dc3/957373dc3a119330246b843bac1aca20.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b><a href="https://garage.maemo.org/projects/evince/">Evince</a></b> is another port of the popular desktop <a href="http://projects.gnome.org/evince/">application of the same name</a> .  This is a very convenient and fast application for viewing documents.  Supports formats Postscript files (PS), Encapsulated PostScript (EPS), DVI and DJVU. <br><img src="http://www.nokian900applications.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/evince-pdf-n900.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b><a href="http://maemo.org/packages/view/freoffice/">Freoffice</a></b> is the port of another well-known office suite - KOffice, a very popular package from the KDE team.  The main bun of this package is support for text files, presentations and tables in ODF format and MS-office.  This is a magic app - office in your pocket. <br><img src="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/files/images/Screenshot-20100119-164321.png" alt="image"><br><img src="http://www.kdedevelopers.org/files/images/Screenshot-20100119-141352.png" alt="image"><br><br>  See you in the next article, all enjoy using the Nokia N900 and Maemo. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/85393/">https://habr.com/ru/post/85393/</a></p>
