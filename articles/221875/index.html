      - Business Applications <br>  This type of mobile application has become a necessary tool for a large number of users, helping to simplify their office work.  Today, business applications are preferable for investors, but sometimes there are some difficulties in moving business tasks to mobile devices. <br><br>  - Mobile Games <br>  Mobile games have a huge market demand.  Developers are constantly creating new games or improving existing ones.  Games attract most of the attention of a huge audience and become a familiar part of the lives of many people. <br><br>  - Social networks <br>  Every day, mobile social networks are becoming increasingly popular, winning fans around the world.  Social network users are becoming more and more, because this is influenced by the increase in the number of smartphone users.  Many people now have the opportunity to visit their pages more often from mobile devices. <br><br>  - Sale of services <br>  Ordering services via mobile applications is quite profitable for service providers.  Order a taxi or food delivery through the application in your mobile phone is incredibly convenient, besides it allows you to save a lot of free time. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúShareware applications are leading the market, and we focus on working with high-quality free applications‚Äù</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/282/e9e/193/282e9e193e908989b6e644692187c15c.png"><br>  <i>Clement Zaika paladin-engineering</i> <br><br><h5>  The volume of the mobile application market and its dynamics </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/050/d48/a3c/050d48a3cf9afbd261cbd3ea589d516d.png"><br><br>  In 2012, according to the research of J`son &amp; Partners Consulting, the market of mobile applications in the world amounted to 7.83 billion dollars, and by 2016 it will reach 65.79 billion dollars.  Thus, we see that the mobile application market is growing in all major regions.  It should be noted that the rapid pace of such growth is due to the expansive nature of the market.  Its volume in the world has increased twenty-five times from 2009 to 2012.  It shows one of the highest growth rates for intelligent products and is quite interesting for investors.  Only such a powerful player as Microsoft can afford to enter the market infrastructure. <br><br>  J`son &amp; Partners Consulting experts predict the development of the volume of this market along with the growth of the mobile technology market.  Here it will be appropriate to recall the mobile game Angry Birds.  This game has captured a huge part of the audience and identified a full-fledged media brand, initially creating it in mobile devices. <br><br><h5>  Basic prerequisites for market growth </h5><br>  - Increasing the impact of mobile social networks <br>  At the end of 2012, the number of people using Facebook through their mobile phones was about six hundred million people.  This social network has focused on the monetization of its mobile version, which became the main task of this company. <br><br>  - Growth in the introduction of tablet computers <br>  In 2012, the number of such devices in circulation worldwide amounted to 177.5 million units. <br><br>  - Development of mobile banking and mobile payment systems. <br>  The main global trends in the mobile application market are the growth in the number of mobile devices, tablet computers, the emergence of operating systems such as iOS, Android, Windows 8, the spread of mobile banking and mobile payment systems.  For users, smartphones become much more convenient in solving everyday tasks than ordinary computers. <br><br>  - The cost of communicating via mobile phones is reduced. <br>  Smartphones are often used to complement the functions of other digital technology (when watching TV or using a computer). <br><br>  - Geolocation. <br>  Due to the growing number of smartphone users, there has been a significant increase in the popularity of GPS navigation, which is tied to Facebook Places, Foursquare, Twitter. <br><br>  - The introduction of LTE and its impact on the mobile application market. <br>  For this market, LTE will become a new growth driver.  High-speed Internet connection allows you to apply more and more resource-intensive advertising technologies. <br><br>  - E-commerce. <br>  All the benefits of e-commerce become acceptable in a handheld device, and they add several useful features that simplify the process of searching for goods.  Mobile commerce is changing the adopted for us application model, giving the opportunity to realize the full functionality of e-commerce in personal devices. <br><br><h5>  Barriers to the growth of the mobile application market </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/761/f0b/dc7/761f0bdc785a9ad9ba00c9d4955e04f7.png"><br><br>  - Uninformed users. <br>  Some users of mobile devices still do not use most of the useful functions of smartphones, and more often use it as a regular cell phone for making calls and sending SMS.  It should be noted that a similar format of using digital services is characteristic of emerging markets, where the need of users for these service offers has not yet been identified. <br><br>  - The difficulties of payment. <br>  For most users of emerging markets, payment complexity is a major barrier to their development.  People are not used to trust mobile systems, not wanting to leave their data in them.  Thus, the main obstacle to the growth of monetization and the development of the market as a whole is still some difficulty of payments in mobile applications. <br><br><h5>  Overview of the mobile applications market in Russia </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/60b/faa/161/60bfaa16161a25bd9aee52f253830853.png"><br><br>  Experts believe that 2009 was the year of birth for the Russian market of mobile applications.  According to experts, the market for mobile applications in 2013 reached one hundred and sixty million dollars, an increase of two hundred and fifty-six percent compared with 2011. <br><br><h5>  How the app store search works </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4d1/c2b/3cc/4d1c2b3cceac7f3ab3d1be7013738b8d.png"><br><br>  When ranking sites, search engines will be repelled by many factors, while in the search for an app store there is no specific assessment on behavioral factors and citation. <br>  Then how is the evaluation of the best application? <br>  App Store Optimization (ASO) is the first thing you should pay attention to.  Search engines, as well as store search, should understand what application you have and what queries you can meet. <br>  In addition, application performance has a huge impact on the ranking of applications: rating, number of downloads, reviews. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúWe have advanced more than 20 applications since our inception, and we can say that growth trends are fascinating‚Äù</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1ce/1ec/3f7/1ce1ec3f71d13ee926f4c600eee1edba.png"><br>  <i>Maxim Chernykh Pappico Development Director</i> <br><br><h5>  The difference between Google Play and the App Store </h5><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/059/abc/ef2/059abcef28263333d3a1cae91e4c7d64.png"><br><br>  For a long time it was believed that the quality of applications in the App Store is much higher than in Google Play.  But in fact, between them there is not much difference.  This is confirmed by analyst Gene Munster from the investment fund Piper Jaffray. <br>  The main thesis of his report is: <br>  <i>‚ÄúThe application ecosystem has reached a level where it no longer matters how many applications are written for a given platform.</i>  <i>The satisfaction that the user gets from working with these applications comes to the fore.</i>  <i>Therefore, now we can see where the applications were some time ago and where they are now from the point of view of users. ‚Äù</i> <br>  This gives us a clear understanding that the further struggle will be for the improvement of the qualities of the stores themselves, the key element of which will be the improvement of the search for applications. <br><br><h5>  Company age or why newcomers should be trusted </h5><br>  Despite the fact that most of the teams engaged in the promotion of mobile applications, formed recently, the productivity of their activities today is comparable to similar activities of companies operating for many years in this area.  Today, almost every young digital agency has its own application promotion department.  Experts in this field who want to work only with the mobile application market predict a great future for him.  They are willing to learn and take risks.  This raises questions about what awaits us in the future with such a growing market. <br><br><h5>  The future of the mobile application market </h5><br>  <i>‚ÄúIn the future, we are waiting for an increase in the number of applications, the rise of competition among developers.</i>  <i>The promotion will be done more by agencies in the manner of the western market. ‚Äù</i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3ed/11e/931/3ed11e9319c68ae9b10ff6eea49b9c81.png"><br>  <i>Anton Krohmalyuk E-legion Marketing Director</i> <i><br></i> <br>  ‚ÄúThe market is growing,‚Äù - this thesis defines the entire market for mobile services and devices.  In our opinion, the most promising areas at this stage lie in the pockets of millions of users, and this situation cannot be ignored. <br>  We are confident that the competition in the market for the promotion of mobile applications will be no less than in the SEO market.  You should be ready to make new decisions and unexpected moves.  It will take quite a bit of time - and the market will be formed to the end.  And today it is a vast field for new products and experiments. <br><br>  Regards, the team <a href="http://top4app.com/">top4app.com</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/221875/">https://habr.com/ru/post/221875/</a></p>
