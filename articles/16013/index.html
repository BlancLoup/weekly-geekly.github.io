  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Improving the efficiency of online stores</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Most stores in the network suffer from the same problems that came to us from real stores.  It is a pity that few of the creators of such stores care for customers and do not use the advantages of the Internet.  In this article I want to consider a few simple ways to improve the store. <br><br>  Content: <br>  1. Structuring <br>  2. The fight against "battery" <br>  3. Sorting <br>  4. Filtering <br>  5. Search <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  1. Structuring <br>  Each store has its own sections (departments), headings and categories.  It is good when they are few and no more.  And when there are quite a lot of them and there are options, what will be more?  In such cases, I see at least three options for submitting the catalog: <img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/006/8d3/257/0068d3257f87a6912cbe6cf8cb6ef3da.jpg" width="450" height="133" alt="directory structure options" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  The first option is good when there is a high probability that there will be new sections.  The last column is for them.  In the second version, all sections are composed in such a way that each of the columns has almost the same height.  And the third presents a concise version, when the link is the name of the section, and below is a brief description. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      2. In each section, as often there are dozens of products.  Very often, designers make a gross mistake with the ‚Äúbattery‚Äù when the same pictograms or inscriptions (such as buy) are next to each product.  But in good stores, such as Amazon, there is no such: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/cd0/f05/b5a/cd0f05b5a07ed4f641f67127bdbea71b.jpg" width="450" height="159" alt="fighting battery" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br>  <a href="http://artgorbunov.ru/bb/soviet/20070604/">A. Gorbunov</a> gave practical advice on this matter.  There was a discussion of this problem. <br><br>  3. The same lists of products can be very well improved by sorting.  Of course, it is not necessary to sculpt in eight different sorts, but several, such as: by price, alphabetical order, user rating, date, number of sales, I think it will be just right. <br>  Here it is important to call sorting.  For example, the ‚Äúpopularity‚Äù event will not immediately make it clear to users what kind of results they will take: from the best to the worst, or vice versa.  I think ‚Äúfrom the most popular to not so‚Äù will be better than the name ‚Äúin popularity‚Äù, although this issue can be discussed for a long time and everyone will stay with him. <br><br>  4. But even a competent catalog structure and the ability to sort will not help with a huge amount of goods.  Here search and filters come to the rescue. <br>  Each of these methods approaches different situations, so one of the two is not the best option.  The search helps people who know what they came for and want to finish it faster.  Filtering serves just the opposite.  It helps the user to reduce the number of products that best fit him.  With the right approach, filters are good for influencing the user. <br>  Filters are used differently.  On some sites there are a lot of filters individually: filter by price, year of release, etc.  On the other filters are complex, where specifying the desired parameters of the goods you get as close as possible to the needs of the goods (for example, in mobile stores).  Sometimes even specific filters are used.  I noticed similar ones in souvenir shops, where the user is offered to filter goods about the purchase, the tasks of the purchase and the person who is given a souvenir.  This option is very good when the user himself does not know what he wants - and there is no time and desire to wander through the maze of offers.  This option brings the store to its real prototype. <br>  Another interesting point.  Once I lost the time on <a href="http://ozon.ru/">Ozon.ru</a> in search of a book that you can read at your leisure, but there was no desire to climb in all categories and read the description.  Then I thought, and it would be cool when I go to the site - and both are on, the book that I need - without any gestures.  That is, the site itself slips you the most likely book for you.  This can be done on the basis of statistical data completed by the user during registration, as well as on the basis of his purchases and wandering around the site. <br><br>  5. The last item to improve is the search.  The main task of any search is to provide data on request, which means that people who are searching already know in most cases what they want.  Sometimes the search is crossed with filtering (some advanced search). <br>  An excellent idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe maximum effectiveness of the situation, when the user knows what he wants offered in <a href="http://bonich.livejournal.com/">his LJ Bogdan Miruk</a> : <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/olpictures/8e0/159/e41/8e0159e41efc73382306009cc4c0f144.png" width="450" height="63" alt="idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãBogdan" hspace="10" vspace="10"><br><br>  I hope you do not waste your time and I am glad that you have read to the end) <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/16013/">https://habr.com/ru/post/16013/</a></p>
