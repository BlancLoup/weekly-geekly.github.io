To date, it has been read more than 62,000 times. <br><br>  The article tells about the programmer Jamie, who came to the company full of enthusiasm and ideas.  It took a couple of years - and Jamie became one of those who "just want to encode."  One of those who do not offer new ideas, new ways of working - but only wants to be left alone, just to write code.

    <h4>  <i>Unfortunately, I received almost no response from managers or managers about this story.</i> </h4><br>  It seems that someone did not understand the essence, so I will say straight. <br><br><h1>  Technical managers, such situations are your fault </h1><br>  You are responsible for unmotivated programmers who "just want to encode" and who seem to be concerned only with fancy new technologies. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  <i>As a manager, you are responsible for creating an environment where everyone can contribute to solving problems.</i> </h4><br>  Instead, it seems that many programmers are viewed as idiot know-alls ‚Äî geeks who can only program. <br><br>  Stop it.  Seriously. <br><br>  The huge resonance of that article should scare the hell out of you.  The market is hot, which gives them the power to send you out and replace them with a better leader. <br><br>  I feel that they are angry as hell - and are no longer going to endure it. <br><br>  <b>Do not believe?</b>  <b>Read on ...</b> <br><br>  I wrote that article in the hope that managers will understand: programmers <i>are eager to</i> fully use their brains, but too often the environment prevents them from doing so. <br><br>  Instead, I received thousands of responses (‚Äúapplause‚Äù to Medium, comments and messages) from programmers who want understanding from managers.  They want their culture to be accepted, their ideas discussed and disputed. <br><br>  Here are some comments that stand out among all ... <br><br><blockquote>  "Oh my God!  This phenomenon of bringing new ideas into the bayonets is the main killer on the whole earth, it hurts every department (this is not only the problem of programmers). <br><br>  ‚ÄúWhen I came to work, I was ready to change the world.  Now every day I try with all my might to suppress my true thoughts - and just put up with the way things are ... I REALLY hope that the management will soon begin to understand the problem. ‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúI had to go through something similar, I even stopped working on home projects, because programming at work became nasty and demanding - I'm glad that I just quit in five months!‚Äù <br><br>  ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sad that the culture of programming in my current environment requires programmers to simply complete tasks rather than think and share ideas.‚Äù </blockquote><br>  A commentator named Hasen has a slightly different opinion. <br><br><blockquote>  <i>‚ÄúWe do not need‚Äú acceptance ‚Äùof ideas.</i>  <i>We have to see that our ideas are discussed and disputed, and the decision is based on the value of the idea, and not on the position of its author.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If I submit an idea, they will discuss it and then reject it, <b>that's fine</b> .</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>If I submit an idea, and they‚Äôll just tell me that I don‚Äôt have to do it ‚Äî and I should just do the current work, then it‚Äôs a clear signal that I‚Äôm only allowed to carry out orders as a soldier.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>When this happens, I will essentially look for another job. ‚Äù</i> </blockquote><br>  This last comment summarizes.  <b>Create an environment in which programmers can fully contribute, otherwise the best of them will go.</b> <br><br><h4>  <i>Let's look at things realistically.</i>  <i>If a team has a problem, you will not fix it in a day.</i>  <i>BUT you can take important steps to solve this problem.</i> </h4><br><h1>  Let's get down to change </h1><br><h3>  Start listening and stop talking. </h3><br>  If some of your developers just want to be left alone, then today is a great day to change everything. <br><br>  Start it in the next one-on-one conversation.  ( <a href="https://marcusblankenship.com/one-on-one-framework">Do not conduct one-on-one conversations? Refer to my guide for a start</a> .) <br><br><h3>  Step 1: Be Modest </h3><br>  Re-start the conversation with each employee and honestly ask if you were deaf to his ideas, did not consider him as a ‚Äúresource‚Äù and did not disappoint him. <br><br>  Regardless of the answer, say that you do not want to be such a boss and that you ask for forgiveness.  ( <i>Yes, it is always good to apologize to a person whom you could offend. Even if you are a boss</i> ). <br><br>  Then tell me that you need his help.  We need his opinion to improve.  Allow me to stop you the next time you act in this way - and in a private conversation to express your opinion about your behavior. <br><br>  Finally, thank him for being with you and doing all this hard work.  Thank you for listening to you and helping you to become the kind of manager they need. <br><br><h3>  Step 2: listen more, speak less </h3><br>  In all relationships with the team speak twice less.  And then another half. <br><br>  It will probably take them by surprise, especially if you have always been ‚Äúadvancing from the front line‚Äù and giving orders. <br><br>  Instead, listen as they talk to each other.  How they talk about customers, executives or other teams.  Who controls the flow?  Who is still trying to put forward ideas?  And who completely shut up? <br><br>  See if everyone can be involved in a discussion with open-ended questions.  Consider using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talking_stick">‚Äúspeaking stick‚Äù</a> if some comrades do not give words to others.  Carefully let know that you want to hear everyone‚Äôs opinion on how to solve the problem. <br><br><h3>  Step 3: Ask more often than you say. </h3><br>  Most development managers are used to telling engineers how to do the job.  Probably because they themselves were engineers before and they "clearly see the solution." <br><br>  However, such orders do not strengthen the team, but they stop their colleagues. <br><br>  So start asking more questions.  Many questions ‚ÄúWHY?‚Äù Of course, you have to plug in curiosity and listen carefully to the answers. <br><br>  In truth, the development of your work and a million of your small decisions depend on the developers.  You should be very interested in their opinions and discussion of their ideas. <br><br>  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Humble-Inquiry-Gentle-Instead-Telling/dp/1609949811/">Ed Shane's book A Modest Question</a> is a great resource to learn to ask the best questions. <br><br><h1>  Managers, you had better fix it before it was too late. </h1><br>  (Still not convinced? Read <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/80jykv/too_many_coders_work_in_environments_where_they/">hundreds of comments from frustrated developers who demand better managers, and then ask yourself: ‚ÄúIs this not my situation?‚Äù</a> ). <br><br>  <b>Continued: <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/post/350544/">"Learned helplessness in software development"</a></b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/350422/">https://habr.com/ru/post/350422/</a></p>
