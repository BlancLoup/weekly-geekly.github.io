Allegedly, it is more difficult to make a mistake when typing. <br><br>  What3words supports 15 languages, new ones appear every few months.  A dictionary of 25,000‚Äì40,000 words is compiled for each language.  All dictionaries together weigh 10 MB. <br><br>  For different languages, the words in the address are different, we are not talking about machine translation.  ‚Äú <a href="http://w3w.co/%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D1%2583%25D0%25BA.%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0.%25D1%2580%25D1%258F%25D0%25B1%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Badger.pok.ryabina</a> ‚Äù in English will turn into ‚Äú <a href="">radio.forget.skis</a> ‚Äù.  Also, the service basically does not use words that look the same in different languages. <br><br>  The address of the required square is found on the map <a href="https://map.what3words.com/">map.what3words.com</a> or in an application for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ru/app/what3words/id657878530%3Fmt%3D8">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.what3words.android%26hl%3Dru">Android</a> .  The creators especially emphasize that the application does not need a network.  For developers, there is an API. <br><br>  All this for free. <br><br><h2>  Why town or garden </h2><br>  The creators are not small things: "addressing systems all over the world do not meet the requirements of modern life."  No more, no less.  And this statement makes sense. <br><br>  <b>Mailing addresses</b> - the system is old, and therefore complex and weakly formalized.  In Russia alone, the devil will break his leg, we wrote an article about this ‚Äú <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/company/hflabs/blog/260601/">Seven programmers have an address without a home</a> ‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hl/t1/p3/hlt1p3y2eaw-akjrqz3drbv97la.jpeg"><br><br>  <sup>For example, in Elektrostal there are addresses "Lenin Ave, 1" and "Lenin Ave, 01".</sup>  <sup>And yes, these are different houses.</sup> <br><br>  At the international level, fun is added: <br><br><ul><li>  different countries have different address formats.  For example, Ireland has its own <a href="https://www.eircode.ie/">Eircode</a> index <a href="https://www.eircode.ie/">system</a> , while in Hong Kong there are no indices at all; <br></li><li>  addresses are always tied to the language: it‚Äôs good when it‚Äôs English, but it can be Thai, Arabic, and Georgian. <br></li></ul><br>  Let's not forget that most of the surface of the Earth has no postal address at all. <br><br>  <b>GPS coordinates</b> are a tool for cars, not people.  ‚Äú60.648834, 47.443597‚Äù cannot be remembered, even if the beloved is waiting at this point.

Three-word addresses mark photos from disaster zones. <br><br>  <b>Land Rover and Mercedes-Benz also in the subject.</b>  The first built service in their application ARDHI: it is something like a social network for offroad fans.  The second even added What3words to the navigation system of their cars. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sNj5n22zAY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <b>Copter Express integrated What3words into drones software.</b>  The manufacturer of delivery drones thinks that it‚Äôs impossible to memorize GPS coordinates, the address is not at every location. <br><br>  <b>What3words comes well in poor regions like Africa.</b>  It‚Äôs sad to navigate there, so Nigeria, Djibouti and Cod d'Ivoire use three-word addresses along with regular ones. <br><br>  A complete list of partners <a href="https://what3words.com/ru/partners/">is on the site</a> , everyone uses What3words more or less equally.  The service is actually used by large companies, it develops and is constantly expanding coverage. <br><br><h2>  What do critics say </h2><br>  Naturally, the global idea attracts haters. <br><br>  Critics note that two-dimensional coordinates will not replace the mailing address.  The creators of What3words did not consider nesting, so forgive floors, apartment or office numbers.  Combined addresses like ‚Äú <a href="http://w3w.co/%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D0%25B4%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9.%25D1%258F%25D0%25B4%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0.%25D0%25B6%25D1%2583%25D1%2587%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BA">proud.djad.zhuchok</a> , kv 23‚Äù are absolutely ridiculous. <br><br>  It seems strange that the algorithm takes apart similar addresses along different edges of the Earth. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/kh/ha/_c/khha_c4rxcywkfvdlzkp3tbcrxw.jpeg"><br><br>  <sup>The creators call this arrangement of similar addresses insurance against typing errors.</sup>  <sup>But the decision destroys the logic of the address system</sup> <br><br>  The fighters of the open-source front were especially frightened.  What3words - the brainchild of private business, driven by copyright.  The owners have already played with monetization: they sold single-word addresses for an annual fee.  Then they stopped.  If they want to, they will turn on more rigid monetization or in general they will cover everything.  They have a right. <br><br><h2>  Normal addresses will not go anywhere </h2><br>  Looks like the creators of <a href="https://what3words.com/">what3words.com</a> have made a useful service.  He is already changing people's lives for the better, so we wish our colleagues success. <br><br>  We will continue on an industrial scale to <a href="https://dadata.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dhabrahabr%26utm_medium%3Darticle%26utm_campaign%3Dwhat3words">clean postal addresses</a> and find for them the GPS coordinates.
