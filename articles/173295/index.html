What is written below is the captain's advice for those who are not yet tired of running around the rake or have not yet understood what they want (and in reality DOES NOT want) to make a potential client.  (Froder, unlike potential customers like to fill out huge forms!) If you do not agree, give counter-examples in the comments.  I and other readers will be grateful to you. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Disclaimer.  The rules primarily relate to the sale of virtual goods and services.  It is difficult to figure out why at once, but there is a difference.

    <h4>  Most importantly: Payment should be as easy as possible. </h4><br>  From this rule all others follow.  The more complex the procedure, the more failures along the way of its implementation.  This is a simple statistic, son. <br><br><h4>  If you do not ship the product / service instantly, then show the buyer the order number and contacts of those.  support </h4><br>  It is very soothing people.  They feel protected.  It is important to have the number 8-800-.  Yes, it is not cheap, but it seriously adds karma points.  In the end, if you constantly call on him about the payment process, then this means only one thing - it is made poorly with you. <br><br><h4>  Payment should be linear, with a minimum number of steps. </h4><br>  Ideal - two steps: the choice of the payment system (PS) and, in fact, the procedure of payment through it.  No need to ask for registration (input via the social network is not counted).  No, no one will be lost.  If you really need, ask for an email / phone number (without re-entering!).  According to them you can find the order in case of error.  Do you have a support service? <br><br><h4>  The data entry form should contain as few fields as possible. </h4><br>  This primarily refers to the cards.  Chronopay, for example, by default for small merchants, gives a form in which you have to double-in (sic!) Drive in your name (once, the second one along with the card data) and another home address.  When, as for receiving a payment, as a rule, only the card number, validity period and CVV are sufficient.  If your EQ card cannot give a payment page with a minimum set of fields, look for another. <br><br><h4>  Point for Assista: KAPTCHA DO NOT NEED! </h4><br>  I wish that my online store was attacked by bots and frantically filled out the form of payment with the correct data. <br><br><h4>  If the extra fields cannot be removed, then fill them automatically with the <i>correct</i> default values. </h4><br>  An example is not quite the topic, but ... Somehow we moved the default radio box from one place to another on our WebMoney reception page.  The turnover of payments increased 1.5 times and then did not fall.  Those.  because of someone's care (or rather, the initial stupidity), all the clients of our company began to earn more by about 10% simply because it became easier for people to pay. <br><br><h4>  Return the user to the same page where he came from or to the page where he can get the goods </h4><br>  This rule comes from the rule of linearity of the process.  It is assumed that you did not even think to open something in a new tab or even in a new window (only if you are not an Assist!). <br><br><h4>  4-5 payment methods are enough </h4><br>  In virtually any country in the world, the first 5 CPs make up at least 90% of the total payments.  In Russia, now they are driving bank cards, mobile payments (suddenly!), POISONS, Kiwi, probably WM (I don‚Äôt know how they are now) and terminals, the share of which is falling.  Soon, I think, a special way of ‚Äúbuying on credit‚Äù will be added.  There are already some precedents. <br><br>  When I worked at a payment aggregator, we all said that the more ways, the better.  This seems to be the case, but there is a nuance.  A lot of PS is needed when you work with different territories, where various payment methods are popular.  At the same time it is worthwhile to offer a person no more than 5 options.  In support of this mnemonic rule, there is the thesis that it‚Äôs difficult to keep more than 7-10 objects at the same time and another experiment about tasting the jam, where more purchases corresponded to the case with fewer choices for choosing tastes (the link is too lazy to search, google). <br><br>  <b>Violation of these simple rules is <s>punishable by a term that</s> reduces the likelihood that payment will be completed!</b>  <b>And that means your profit.</b> <br><br>  In my opinion, the payment process is best done by the Russian Group (it looked about a year ago). <br><br>  I also advise you to read the book Web Design 4 ROI on a related topic (there is a Russian version; I don‚Äôt give you a link, because last time I was banned for 6 months).  There is a chapter about payment and useful information about other important pages of the online store site. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173295/">https://habr.com/ru/post/173295/</a></p>
