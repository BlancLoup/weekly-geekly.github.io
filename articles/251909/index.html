It was trite wondering if any ray of light would flash behind the harsh theory.  I looked at programming languages, project management, analytics.  And today I saw a course, information about which I wanted to share. <br><br>  Its title is in the title, and the translation of the description below, but for now a few words, why I consider that it is useful to everyone: <br><ul><li>  For beginners, you can learn a new technology for them or pull up knowledge that has not yet been strengthened. </li><li>  Guru Rails can earn a Verified Certificate and thereby confirm their knowledge to the public.  For example, it can be attached to LinkedIn or specified in responses on freelance </li></ul><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Go to the translation of the course content.  Free translation.

    <h4>  About the course </h4><br>  In this course we will look at the development of a web application architecture from an engineering point of view.  We consider the fundamental design patterns and the philosophy of modern web application architecture, including its main components.  By the end of the course, I expect you to: <br><br><h6>  Design, develop and deploy modern web applications </h6><br>  This course is not about how to create a beautiful web page, it is about how to develop and close the full stack of protocols and technologies that are required for a full-fledged web application.  This does not mean that you will become an expert in this field in a few weeks.  My goal is rather to take you on the right path, talking about a solid foundation and a framework that will help you understand web applications, allow you to dig deeper and explore much more on your own. <br><br><h6>  You will learn to understand the main architectural components in a web application and their interaction. </h6><br>  Modern web applications are quite complex.  A typical application includes a database with a huge number of scripts at the back end, a web server in the middle that delivers information over the Internet and a browser.  Even dealing with these three components can be a good task!  Consider only the programming languages ‚Äã‚Äãof a typical technology stack: from the database (SQL) to the web server (scripting languages) and browser (JS, HTML, CSS).  It turns out as many as five programming languages, while not mentioning the protocols with which they work.  But you will have to deal with them!  We will introduce you to different design patterns that will help to deal with seeming complexity. <br><br><h6>  Using Ruby on Rails </h6><br>  We are going to learn about web applications using the Ruby on Rails framework.  Rails is a web application framework that was born at the dawn of the Ruby programming language.  I believe that this is one of the best frameworks for studying web applications, which has proved its effectiveness in commercial projects.  It is worth noting that there are many other frameworks and the concept that you learn here can be transferred to other frameworks. <br><br><h6>  Better understanding of modern development practices </h6><br>  We will use the latest tools and practices of web development, version control system, testing, application deployment.  This includes familiarization with the practice of agile development, a large number of tools that every web developer should be able to use, as well as cloud resources that have recently been increasingly used in web development. <br><br>  - end of translation <br>  Link <a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/webapplications">to the course.</a> <br>  Beginning <b>March 16th.</b> <br>  The course is organized by the University of New Mexico.  In my opinion a great replacement for paid courses.  Especially considering the traditional activity of the forums on the cursor. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251909/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251909/</a></p>
