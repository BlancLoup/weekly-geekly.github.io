This tradition is popular all over the world, and in recent years it is gaining momentum in Russia.  A bit of history.  The ‚Äúfather‚Äù of this holiday is an American system administrator with 20 years of experience Ted Kekatos, who saw a Hewlett-Packard magazine ad, in which thankful users donated flowers and baskets of fruit to the new printers of the system administrator.  Kekatos, who recently installed several printers of the same model, decided to create a special day dedicated to the profession of a system administrator.  The first such day, arranged by Kekatos, fell on Friday, July 28, 2000.  It was just a picnic on the outskirts of Chicago, in which members of a small software company took part.  Since then, the holiday is usually celebrated on the last Friday of July. <br><br>  2006 began to celebrate the "World Day of the Information Society" (since 2007, World Telecommunication and Information Society Day), which is set for May 17th.  Proclaimed by the UN General Assembly, this memorable day has an official status, and, apparently, can replace the day of the system administrator. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  However, the last Friday of July is not going to give up.  For example, since 2006, an All-Russian gathering of system administrators is held annually near Kaluga, gathering more and more participants every year.  So, if the first gathering was attended by about 350 people, then in 2009 more than 4,000 people from 174 cities in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan arrived.  There is also a collection of system administrators in Novosibirsk, which takes place on the shores of the Ob Sea.

      Every year more and more people take part in this holiday, and we believe that this is very cool!  After all, the modest workers of the ‚Äúinvisible front‚Äù should have their day and their holiday, so that they remember how important and valuable their work is.  In the end, the successful and stable activities of companies directly depend on them. <cut><br><br>  This year the holiday fell on Friday July 29th.  Since our program is directly related to the work of the system administrators, we decided that we should celebrate this day together, and for such a case we rented a whole room in one of Moscow pubs.  We invite all the cool system administrators of Moscow (and other cities, too, if they get there) to spend the last Friday of July with us.  The event will be held in the format of an informal dialogue.  All guests will be treated to an excellent dinner with burgers, steaks and, of course, an abundance of beer and pleasant communication with colleagues in the shop. <br><br><br>  Well, on the occasion here are the contents of our "repository": <br>  ‚Ä¢ 0.1 L - demo; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 0.25 l - trial version; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 0.5 L - personal edition; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 0.7 l - professional edition; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1 L - network edition; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 1.75 l - enterprise; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 3 l - for small business; <br>  ‚Ä¢ 5 l - corporate edition; <br>  ‚Ä¢ bottle of moonshine - home edition; <br>  ‚Ä¢ On the road - service pack; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Brine in the morning - recovery tool; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Snack - plugins; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Beer - patch; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Coca-cola, Fanta, 7-UP - trojan viruses. <br><br>  You can sign up for the celebration by <a href="https://driverpack.timepad.ru/event/356122/">filling out the questionnaire on TimePad</a> <i>(DriverPack treats!)</i> </cut></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/306528/">https://habr.com/ru/post/306528/</a></p>
