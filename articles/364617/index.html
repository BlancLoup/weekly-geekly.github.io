Home or office, cottage or cottage, warehouse or shop - everywhere the video recording system will find practical application.  To ensure maximum security of the object, <a href="http://secur.ua/videonablyudenie/">video surveillance</a> can be used in conjunction with other security systems, such as alarms.  So our company decided to equip an office building with video surveillance systems, after the security guard ‚Äúblinked‚Äù, as the adjacent cars in the adjacent parking lot were ‚Äúpicked up‚Äù by the cars of three employees.  The honorable mission of choosing a video surveillance system went to the author of the article, as the most technically savvy.  I decided to share my impressions about choosing a video surveillance system in this review.  After all, given the relevance of the installation of video surveillance, our experience is definitely useful to someone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The principle of operation of the analog video surveillance system is as follows.  There are several video cameras in the controlled area.  They transmit the image to the DVR - a kind of center for storing and processing information.  The recorder is a fairly intelligent device capable of making decisions independently in alarming events: detecting unauthorized traffic, trying to close or damage one of the cameras, etc. In addition, the recorder provides access to the saved video files and screenshots made by the surveillance system.  The image from the cameras thanks to the recorder can be transferred to any distance, if the latter is connected to the Internet.  That is, even being on another continent, it is easy for the user to control the situation at a remote object equipped with a video surveillance system.

      The number of cameras supported by the DVR can vary widely.  But usually, for reliable control of the perimeter of a detached house, building, store or warehouse, 4 cameras looking ‚Äúon all four sides‚Äù are sufficient.  That is why for testing 4 camera surveillance kits were selected.  These are sets of statically mounted cameras that are more affordable.  In the presence of 4 cameras, ‚Äústatic‚Äù sets are not much inferior in capabilities to surveillance systems that have camera turning devices and remote control.  In addition, cameras without rotary mechanisms safer.  This is important for individuals and small companies who install a video surveillance system based on long-term operation, but do not want to constantly bother with the service maintenance of devices.  However, if desired, any of the tested kits can be easily retrofitted with PTZ cameras, this functionality is supported.  Another interesting point was the appearance on the Ukrainian market of AHD surveillance kits offering enhanced image quality.  So far, the choice of AHD equipment is more than modest, but we managed to purchase one such kit for practical testing. <br><br>  <b>Testing method</b> <br><br>  The management wished to receive a detailed report with an objective assessment of the video surveillance systems being compared.  Well, so that there are no kickbacks there and so on.  Therefore, willy-nilly, I had to invent a testing methodology.  Surveillance kits will be evaluated on several criteria using a 10-point scale.  Plus, we assign a certain coefficient of importance to each criterion - from 0.1 to 1. Why?  Well, for example, the user is likely to quickly throw away the packaging set, so it is not so important - you can assign a minimum importance factor of 0.1 (10% importance) to it.  But with the convenience of the user interface will have to face constantly throughout the operation of the video surveillance system, this criterion should be assigned the maximum importance factor 1 (100% importance). <br><br>  <b>The evaluation criteria are as follows:</b> <br><br>  - Packaging that protects the kit during transport and at the same time attracts the attention of the consumer with its design.  Coefficient of importance of 0.1; <br>  - Appearance of the recorder and cameras.  It is this criterion that allows devices to best fit into the exquisite landscape design and cozy home interior.  The coefficient of importance of 0.8; <br>  - The quality of performance of all the devices in the kit largely determines the operational reliability.  The maximum coefficient of importance is 1; <br>  - Completeness determines the completeness of a set of related accessories and cables.  The coefficient of importance of 0.5; <br>  - Convenience of connection is better, the less the user experiences with the installation of equipment.  The coefficient of importance of 0.7; <br>  - The user manual should even help an ignorant person to understand the technique.  The coefficient of importance of 0.5; <br>  - The image quality of the cameras determines how well the video surveillance system ‚Äúsees‚Äù the details of the environment.  The maximum coefficient of importance is 1; <br>  - The convenience of the user interface of the recorder is responsible for how comfortable it is to use the video surveillance system for everyday use.  The maximum coefficient of importance is 1; <br>  - Price characterizes the availability of goods for the widest possible range of consumers.  The coefficient of importance is 0.9; <br>  - The final grade determines how many points the device has gained, taking into account the importance factors for the evaluation criteria.  The maximum amount of points is 65. For each device, the table shows the% of the maximum score, showing the degree of satisfaction of the maximum user requests;  the higher is the better. <br><br>  <b>Test participants:</b> <br><br>  Video Surveillance Kit ALFA DVR Kit OUTdoors 4 H264 (ASS-DVRout264H); <br>  Hikvision DS-J143i 4 Out Surveillance Kit; <br>  Surveillance kit KGUARD Security Easy Link (EL821-4HW212B); <br>  Surveillance security kit Smart-4 4U (UL-700K-4); <br>  Surveillance Kit Guard AHD Wagon. <br><br>  All of these kits are not designed as a simple stand-alone installation, so they fit the widest range of consumers. <br><br>  <b>ALFA DVR Kit OUTdoors 4 H264</b> <br><br>  The package is framed in soothing colors - not too catchy, but attractive enough (Fig. 1). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/592/ad3/de6/592ad3de64b8414cb3fcee9a830577a2.JPG"><br>  Fig.  1. Packaging ALFA DVR Kit <br><br>  Inside there is a packed recorder and a white cardboard box with cameras and connecting cables (Fig. 2). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/594/e15/3fc/594e153fccf446479f46309fc1e9a209.JPG"><br>  Fig.  2. ALFA DVR Kit <br><br>  The cameras inside the white box are not placed in separate boxes, like all other kits, but simply hidden in protective bags.  White cardboard boxes next to them contain a fastener kit and a bracket (Fig. 3). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/def/06d/e4b/def06de4be4b4d3bb9ce981db9539c59.JPG"><br>  Fig.  3. Boxing with cameras and cables ALFA DVR Kit <br><br>  The registrar case is decorated in soothing black tones, typical for household appliances (Fig. 4). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff3/b17/ab0/ff3b17ab0f3d406c8991c9c56274de2b.JPG"><br>  Fig.  4. DVR ALFA DVR Kit <br><br>  The device is not intended for vertical mounting on the wall.  From below - rubber legs for reliable horizontal installation. <br>  From the useful accessories in the kit mouse, remote control.  Two power adapters.  The first, for the recorder, is designed for an output current of 2A (Fig. 5). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/81f/aec/d75/81faecd753a94efe9cbac0bf0eb01f48.JPG"><br>  Fig.  5. ALFA DVR Kit power supply unit <br><br>  The second, more powerful 3A adapter is for cameras (Fig. 6). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2fd/7e4/575/2fd7e45753f64587a7a79c92fffbe150.JPG"><br>  Fig.  6. ALFA DVR Kit Camera Power Supply <br><br>  The first embarrassment lurked with him: the plug of the power cord for this adapter has a connector that cannot be found in Ukrainian houses (Fig. 7). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/71a/321/39b/71a32139b39b46a5a739b53dfdf0b019.JPG"><br>  Fig.  7. ALFA DVR Camera Power Adapter Plug <br><br>  I had to connect the adapter through the adapter.  The lack of the necessary adapter or ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù kopek power cord should be recognized as a significant disadvantage.  Creating user unexpected problems with self-installation.  For example, if the installation of video surveillance takes place in a suburb or village, then imagine how much time and gasoline the search and purchase of the necessary adapter will take. <br><br>  The registrar himself seemed to like it.  Sophisticated design, conveniently spaced buttons (Fig. 8), clear LED indicators and what's important is not too bright.  Front - USB connector for easy connection of the same mouse.  The buttons on the circular panel have poorly visible icons and labels, but this is not critical at all.  But the very short cord of the power adapter turned out to be a fly in the ointment.  Place for the "Alpha" to look for near outlets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f4/7dd/01c/8f47dd01cbfa4e4bae004a33884cb1be.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/09e/b5d/aff/09eb5daff2904f138a4a4c195648bb48.JPG"><br>  Fig.  8. Front and rear panels of the ALFA DVR Kit <br><br>  The cameras are officially street "metal", but ... You know, with very large plastic inserts.  The specific silver color (Fig. 9) unwittingly associates them with cheap Chinese toys. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1da/c84/c87/1dac84c87c8b4dcfbb2cc484ccf90a8f.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/dee/f43/368/deef433687f44630b063d7fbd5974958.JPG"><br>  Fig.  9. Camera ALFA DVR Kit <br><br>  The association is enhanced by the careless assembly of chambers, on the body of which large gaps are visible (Fig. 10). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e32/b67/d5c/e32b67d5c7ff4f7eae625816f28644dd.jpg"><br>  Fig.  10. Careless assembly of cameras ALFA DVR Kit <br><br>  Moisture can easily penetrate through such holes into the chamber; in the winter, ice will freeze in the gaps in the cracks, increasing the ‚Äúcracks‚Äù.  This is no good.  We would be afraid to put cameras with this build quality on the street.  There is confidence that they will live right up to the first heavy fog or good rain with a breeze.  Of course, other analog cameras are easily connected to the recorder, but this is already a story with a completely different budget. <br><br>  There is no screw for fixing the visor in the camera kit, although there is a thread for it on the case.  Apparently they thought that it was not needed - it was very difficult to move the visor off, except that it was ‚Äúeasy knocking with a sledge hammer‚Äù.  Adjusting the optimal size of the visor is a very nontrivial task and is clearly designed for brute masculine strength and strong words.  A separate brutal leg-bracket, like in the cheapest cylindrical chambers, complements the unsightly picture (Fig. 11). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/549/a4f/f9c/549a4ff9cfff4c1f9178d791c65254ce.JPG"><br>  Fig.  11. Camera Bracket ALFA DVR Kit <br><br>  The cameras do not have any marking that allows them to be identified.  A round sticker on the back of the camera indicates a horizontal resolution of 700 TVL.  Visually, the cameras reach it, the image quality is very good for analog video and is not inferior to other sets with cameras of the same class. <br><br>  The instructions are attached to the recorder in English, and to the cameras - also in Chinese.  Even if you read the instructions, it will not help much.  The menu of the included recorder is greeted with familiar Russian (Fig. 12). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bb7/5d9/442/bb75d944257f4c618aa3cf7c660b3e6d.JPG"><br>  Fig.  12. ALFA DVR Kit menu items <br><br>  In general, the menu was pleasant - intuitive, convenient, simple.  Although a bit "mysterious" - the cuttings of phrases can greatly puzzle the uninformed in the intricacies of the user's video surveillance settings.  The mouse can partially help out: when you hover over an incomprehensible menu item, a corresponding hint appears with the full name of the option (Fig. 13).  But this trick does not work, alas, not always. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/252/b2f/3c9/252b2f3c96f946c586614e3e8b6a447a.JPG"><br>  Fig.  13. ALFA DVR Kit Menu Tips <br><br>  Well, headers like ‚ÄúAssistant on‚Äù, ‚ÄúPrimary n‚Äù or ‚ÄúConfigure to‚Äù will surely be amused while preparing the system for work (Fig. 14). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/055/c45/229/055c452298964a6bbaa1d027432eb43c.JPG"><br>  Fig.  14. Not quite correct Russification of the ALFA DVR Kit menu. <br><br>  Right-clicking on the view screen pops up the context menu (Fig. 15) - also convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/859/efd/d8a/859efdd8ab884f598efa343385d69166.JPG"><br>  Fig.  15. Context menu ALFA DVR Kit <br><br>  The functionality of the video surveillance system settings did not disappoint: here you can record analog video as D1 (704x576) from all 4 cameras in real time, and the ability to adjust the speed and quality of the recording to save hard disk space (Fig. 14), and quad mode, and convenient setting of "invisible" privacy zones, and the ability to send alarm messages in case of detection of alarm events (Fig. 13), etc.  The presence of an Ethernet interface allows you to connect the recorder to a computer network for remote viewing of video locally or via the Internet. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  In this set, a good registrar to the company got bad cameras.  Which seems to be a good show, but they are absolutely impossible to recommend for installation on the street because of the disgusting build quality.  Confusion with an unsuitable plug and an unreasonably high price with the obvious cheapness of components did not allow this kit to take the lead in the test - a non-triumphant first place from the end with 33.3 points, or 51% of the maximum mark.  That is, the kit satisfies the user's expectations from the video surveillance system only by about half. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <strong>ALFA DVR Kit OUTdoors 4 H264</strong> <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Criterion</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>Coefficient</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>Score</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>Evaluation</strong> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Packaging <br></td><td>  0.1 <br></td><td>  eight <br></td><td>  0.8 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Appearance <br></td><td>  0.8 <br></td><td>  five <br></td><td>  four <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Workmanship <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  3 <br></td><td>  3 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Completeness <br></td><td>  0.5 <br></td><td>  3 <br></td><td>  1.5 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Convenience of connection <br></td><td>  0.7 <br></td><td>  five <br></td><td>  3.5 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  User's Manual <br></td><td>  0.5 <br></td><td>  four <br></td><td>  2 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Image quality <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  7 <br></td><td>  7 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  User Interface Convenience <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  7 <br></td><td>  7 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Price <br></td><td>  0.9 <br></td><td>  five <br></td><td>  4.5 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>final grade</strong> <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  <strong>3</strong> <strong>3</strong> <strong>,</strong> <strong>3</strong> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>% of maximum score</strong> <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  <strong>51</strong> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>Hikvision DS-J143i 4 Out</b> <br><br>  The neat, ‚Äúplump‚Äù box in the Hikvision package looks pretty nice and promises us an easy installation right away (Fig. 16).  The snag is that the image on the box does not match what is inside. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/edb/2c6/7a3/edb2c67a344045aeb1ad0389d2888ca1.JPG"><br>  Fig.  16. Packaging Hikvision DS-J143i 4 Out <br><br>  The package shows two dome cameras, which in reality do not exist.  The kit comes with 4 outdoor cameras, which can be easily seen by opening the ‚Äúunmarked‚Äù cardboard box containing the kit's cameras (Fig. 17). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c44/fc9/a2c/c44fc9a2c5334864abe9b7d0c3f7abda.JPG"><br>  Fig.  17. Hikvision DS-J143i 4 Out Kit <br><br>  In the delivery set there is no remote control, only a mouse.  Moreover, SATA cables and hard disk power supply are not hidden in the recorder case, like other suppliers, but are attached in separate cases, as if reminding you to connect the HDD on your own. <br>  Alas, no doubtful decisions have not done.  The power supply unit (Fig. 18) has a unique connector to which the power splitter is connected to the recorder and the camera (Fig. 19). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/72b/59b/7c3/72b59b7c3e9b4df98f090c25ee35ec86.JPG"><br>  Fig.  18.

Power splitter with non-standard Hikvision DS-J143i 4 Out connector <br><br>  If the splitters of all other manufacturers are standard and compatible with each other, then the situation is different.  In case of accidental damage to the splitter or power supply during installation, it will be necessary to change them ‚Äúin set‚Äù with standard solutions.  For it is extremely difficult to find commercially available items with unique connectors.  The power supply has a label in Chinese, but it is still clear that the output current of 3.33A - the manufacturer found it sufficient to supply both the recorder and the cameras.  The maximum consumption of complete cameras is stated at 4 W, so, in principle, the power of the unit should be enough even at peak load when the night light is on. <br><br>  The view of the registrar itself is fascinating (Fig. 20).  Here's how to do home devices!  Stylish, attractive body with no sharp corners in a milky white color.  It is simply impossible to find fault with the build quality and design, except in terms of ergonomics, the absence of a USB port on the front panel is inconvenient.  For example, the same mouse to control the recorder is much more convenient to insert into the front USB connector, if the device is installed on the table. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/afe/dc6/49c/afedc649c70044808a113bda0a11fa2e.JPG"><br>  Fig.  20. DVR Hikvision DS-J143i 4 Out <br><br>  If the device is mounted on the wall - another thing, the "rear" connectors will be on the side.  Yes, the recorder can be mounted on the wall (Fig. 21), so as not to take space on the tables. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/702/0cc/53c/7020cc53ca604f74a7f1f86a19441132.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8b5/d43/875/8b5d438755dc427b96a10ea62aacf570.JPG"><br>  Fig.  21. The bottom and back of the recorder Hikvision DS-J143i 4 Out <br><br>  White cameras with a small black plastic rim of the visor look perfectly immaculate (Fig. 22).  Just nothing to complain about.  Some kind of idyll.  The white color of the cameras is also combined with the color of the recorder that lovers of harmony in everything will appreciate. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/eea/54b/6c2/eea54b6c2196449d9059b952dbad3ee8.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/941/65c/253/94165c2537424d84bf3583ab825da3b3.JPG"><br>  Fig.  22. Hikvision DS-J143i 4 Out Camera <br><br>  According to the instructions.  In Russian, only a leaflet, briefly explaining how to properly "put together" a video surveillance system.  Instructions for managing the recorder is attached to the great and mighty language of Albion.  You can read it to deepen the knowledge of technical English.  The default recorder starts with the Russian-language menu. <br><br>  When connecting a Hikvision video surveillance kit, there are two important points to keep in mind.  First, connect the monitor via VGA or HDMI output before applying voltage to the recorder.  If you connect the monitor to an already powered device, the cursor does not appear on the screen.  And since the model has no remote control and buttons on the case, it will be completely unrealistic to get into the device menu.  If you do not know about this significant flaw in the firmware, the hardware connection will be painfully long and nervous.  Probably, even with calls-curses to the seller for the "idle" equipment.  The second unpleasant moment.  Hikvision Kit is strongly discouraged from people with a weak and unstable psyche, nervous disorders, and cardiovascular diseases.  In all seriousness.  The fact is that after detecting the absence of a hard disk or another problem when the system is turned on, the recorder periodically beeps loudly and persistently.  Other recorders also squeak speakers, but squeaking a little, stop, rightly believing that they have notified of a certain problem.  Hikvision is surprisingly insistent!  And if you do not know where and what to quickly disconnect, this squeak simply infuriates.  Even a healthy person can get a nervous concussion, what to speak about patients ... A drop-down menu brings up a right click with the mouse, and from this you can get to the main menu with all the settings.  So, you need to disable it here: <b>Main menu - System configuration - Warnings</b> - uncheck the items <b>Network is disabled</b> (if you are not using a network connection) - <b>HDD error</b> (if you do not plan to save video locally) and <b>Exclude recording</b> .  However, after this the buzzer will not work with other alarms, even if they are activated in the menu.  For example, when trying to steal a camera or close an image.  In general, the menu here, though rich in settings, is lame in terms of logic.

There is a curious section of the menu that allows you to programmed to include camera recordings on holidays so that they capture the relaxed and cheerful behavior of the guests for posting videos on social networks). In general, in terms of functionality, there are no complaints about the kit.

QR code with the registrar ID KGUARD Security Easy Link After </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">looking more closely at the registrar, you begin to notice a ‚Äúbut‚Äù. Looking at the metal front panel, covered with a protective film, you notice scratches on the metal. That is, the equipment comes scratched from the factory (Fig. 33).</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/76a/9d4/ece/76a9d4ece6ba4d4b91ca9cf9dc617d6b.jpg"><br>  Fig.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">33. Scratches on the front panel of the KGUARD Security Easy Link </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Perhaps the ‚Äúscars‚Äù on the front panel give the device a stylish and ‚Äúmanly‚Äù look, but will certainly cause unnecessary questions when you try to return the recorder to the store or hand over to the service. It is not excluded that shrewd Chinese manufacturers or Russian suppliers specifically take this step in order to avoid warranty obligations. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The kit is powered by two completely identical power adapters with an output current of 2 A. The only thing that distinguishes the adapters is the paper stickers on the case (Fig. 34).</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/3f7/828/7ac/3f78287ac4d94409ac0ccf71d3304fe1.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/756/040/ee7/756040ee75bc4927a7eb49add157229b.jpg"><br>  Fig.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">34.

Unprecedented generosity ... The </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">registrar immediately has 8 BNC video inputs for connecting cameras (Fig. 35). While other tested models are content with four. However, for more inputs, the user pays extra money. It would seem that 4 more places under the camera - a good foundation for the future. The only problem is that the future is digital, in the extreme case of high-resolution analog AHD cameras. Which are absolutely incompatible with this registrar. Therefore, to call an additional investment of money a reasonable language does not turn.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/38c/b8d/796/38cb8d7968934dd286aebbef2e5e7811.jpg"><br>  Fig.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">35. 8 BNC video inputs on the rear panel of the KGUARD Security Easy Link recorder. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Externally, the camera kit looks pretty good. But it is worth looking at the lens, as it becomes noticeable that they were collected not quite straight-eyed friends from the Middle Kingdom. The persistent feeling that the lens is "mowing down" visually (Fig. 36). And this concerns not just one camera, but all of them.</font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c01/3d6/d3b/c013d6d3b85f45afbc211bf52d5940a8.jpg"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/31f/ffc/807/31fffc80798e40f9b6a763fb5751301c.jpg"><br>  Fig.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">36. KGUARD Security Easy Link Camera </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As it turned out, in fact, the lens is centered normally. A "mows" round decorative insert in the middle of protective glass. But the sediment remained. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The camera's visor is not adjustable in length, and its position on the bracket is set using the special hex key included in the kit. It is completely incomprehensible that the standard screwdriver did not please the creators of this set. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For night illumination, only two LEDs are used. On the other hand, they are powerful, so it‚Äôs quite possible to count on an effective range of infrared illumination at 15-20 m. At the BNC camera connector they put on a protective cap - very well.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The image quality from the cameras is not impressed. Officially, the models have a resolution of 600TVL. And this is clearly seen, the clarity of the picture is visually worse than even the cameras of the ALFA DVR Kit, which look much more pathetic. Definitely, the worst-quality images of the camera among all tested are from the KGUARD set. Initially, a dark, oversaturated image of cameras can still be tried to adjust in brightness and color, but nothing will help a blurred image with ‚Äúblurred‚Äù details. </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It's nice that the kit is accompanied by a paper instruction in the Ukrainian language. Let the instruction and not absolutely correspond to the model of the registrar. But there it is written in black and white that the system will ask for a password when it starts up, which is 123456 by default. However, in practice ...</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">When powering the recorder starts, without asking for a password at all. At first they did not believe it. But what about safety ?! The password starts asking the user only if during the work you press the "Lock" button in the on-screen menu.</font></font> But!<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">It is necessary to pull out the power from the recorder and plug it in again - as it becomes open for access to everyone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">That is, any intruder, being at the registrar, will be able to view the video archive and delete recordings, set up unauthorized remote viewing of cameras or redirect sending alarm messages to fake or controlled addresses. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">At the same time, the owner of the video surveillance system who is not too versed in such things may not even suspect anything. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For this feature of "work" the device gets a big fat minus! </font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Positive too. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">The on-screen menu has a convenient pop-up bottom panel, from where it is easy to quickly go to the main menu, enable single or multiple viewing, activate alternate ‚Äúbypass‚Äù of cameras, etc.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> The main menu is for some reason originally presented in this form (Fig. 37). </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df0/84b/c9f/df084bc9f2a545d2b1150e7cc7d49df9.jpg"><br>  Fig.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">37.

Packaging Guard Smart-4 4U (UL-700K-4) <br><br>  But the manufacturer, unlike the others, added a protective sticker to the box.  That is, when buying a kit, the user will surely know that no one has opened the package before him and has not dragged anything useful from the kit: there are dowels, a patch cord or stickers ‚ÄúVideo surveillance is in progress.‚Äù  By the way, according to Ukrainian law, such stickers should be placed in the places where cameras are installed.  Only here, apart from the ‚ÄúGuardians‚Äù seller, nobody is particularly puzzled by this. <br>  And that's what's inside the big white box (Fig. 42). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/41d/b5f/8ca/41db5f8ca2794aec98173d6f66db5a3a.JPG"><br>  Fig.  42. Set of Guards Smart-4 4U (UL-700K-4) <br><br>  In the package with the recorder waited a pleasant surprise.  A small, compact white device, so even with well-thought-out ergonomics - USB ports on the front panel.  The diodes of the indicators and the large window of the receiver of the IR signals from the console, which is also included, do not affect the attractiveness of the design at all (Fig. 43). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5c4/414/bfe/5c4414bfe41e45b79f8782d8ffd2515c.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da4/942/fa9/da4942fa971a4acea551e868ae792e15.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/726/a51/f32/726a51f32c5343efb9e9a9bf29d841bd.JPG"><br>  Fig.  43. DVR Guard Smart-4 4U (UL-700K-4) <br><br>  The compactness of the housing of this recorder has put forward some specific requirements.  So, for video recording inside you can install only a 2.5 ‚Ä≥ hard disk type notebook.  Whereas other models of recorders use more familiar 3.5 "drives.  In principle, the solution has both advantages and disadvantages.  HDD 2.5 "" have a slightly higher cost per megabyte of stored information.  But they are more reliable: due to the smaller dimensions of the plates and levers of the magnetic heads, these devices trivially experience less mechanical stress during operation, and are therefore able to last longer. <br><br>  Installation of the recorder on the wall is not provided.  In addition, this model uses a 5V power supply (Fig. 44), while all other recorders are powered by more conventional 12-volt sources. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1ac/6be/fe0/1ac6befe0f16433093712b97771ea8a8.JPG"><br>  Fig.  44.

If the plug is half out of the connector for fear of "breaking something", the device will not work.  But thanks to the tight connector, the plug does not fall out. <br>  A separate 12V power adapter is used to power the cameras (Fig. 45). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/594/761/e11/594761e11b704bc28f3768bbabf5b5db.JPG"><br>  Fig.  45.

Sliding protective visor sits tight and does not require fixing screw.  At the same time, it is easily shifted by hand.  The assembly of cameras is of high quality, there are no complaints (Fig. 46).  At the same time, the user can independently remove the protective glass in order to install another lens in the camera, for example, if he needs a different focal length.  Of the minuses - the camera bracket is adjusted with a small hex key, and not with a screwdriver, which is not always convenient.  Having fallen, a small key is easily lost.  However, the key is in the bundle of each camera, losing them all 4 at the same time will be quite difficult. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/70d/a8a/7eb/70da8a7ebc25477b8312a19411ddc94c.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8c6/52b/746/8c652b746e454dfebd2c03fef0827d98.JPG"><br>  Fig.  46. ‚Äã‚ÄãCamera set of Guards Smart-4 4U (UL-700K-4) <br><br>  It turned out to be the only kit that has all three instructions in plain Russian.  The instructions for connecting the recorder and the camera are well illustrated, and the user is given a list of accessories compatible with the kit. <br><br>  The image quality of the cameras at the level of the Hikvision suite, that is very good for its class.  You can put a plus behind the cameras, the manufacturer did not go after the cheap and did not complete their sets with a frank "cheap", like some competitors. <br><br>  The recorder menu is well-designed, very convenient and intuitive, with attractive fonts.  At the same time, the functionality even pleasantly surprised.  How do you, for example, have the ability to accurately position an image on an analog monitor (Fig. 47), if it is shifted beyond the edge of the screen? <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/984/6a3/b26/9846a3b26b994e22b803eb9ea68b6019.jpg"><br>  Fig.  47.

Image setting in the Guard Smart 4 4U menu (UL-700K-4) <br><br>  And in general, the model seemed extremely User-friendly, user-friendly.  Russification of the menu as a whole is good, although it was also not without distortions.  For example, a tab called ‚Äúmanagement‚Äù does not switch to the view from the office of the chief, but leads to the menu section with settings for account control functions, information about the device and firmware update options (Fig. 49). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fe8/9f2/9d2/fe89f29d2baa49668f9a360fc45228e1.jpg"><br>  Fig.  49. The menu of the Guardian Smart-4 4U menu (UL-700K-4) <br><br>  Here, for example, there is a section ‚ÄúAuto Functions‚Äù (Fig. 50) which provides for the possibility of not only automatic reboot according to a schedule, but also deletion of old files in order not to overwhelm the disk storage. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4ea/1e7/16a/4ea1e716a6d444d5b69360e923dac639.jpg"><br>  Fig.  50.

Context menu of Guardian Smart-4 4U (UL-700K-4) <br><br>  As for recording, the camera allows you to choose 4 arbitrary time periods of automatic recording per day, both on an ongoing basis and on the motion sensor.

Setting the recording schedule in the Guard Smart 4 4U menu (UL-700K-4) <br><br>  The functionality did not let us down: the detection of movement, the attempt to remove it or the closing of the camera were successfully determined.  In this case, in the event of emergency situations, it is possible to select the type of informing the user - a pop-up message on the display or a buzzer.  For example, in the absence of the same hard disk or the inability to write to it, you can simply display information on the screen, and not annoy the user with a peek for some reason he does not understand (Fig. 53). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d14/983/a3a/d14983a3aec94ed7b7be880e83f49f27.jpg"><br>  Fig.  53. Informing about events in the Guardian Smart 4 4U menu (UL-700K-4) <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  The set of Guardians Smart-4 4U (UL-700K-4) was pleasantly surprised by the good work of the equipment, good user instructions and the successful Russified settings menu of the video surveillance system.  It can be seen that the manufacturer tried to offer a solution that is balanced by the possibilities, and not just to mold a set of equipment from the category of ‚Äúcheap and cheerful‚Äù.  Given the low price of the kit, it is safe to call this model the most justified purchase in terms of price / quality ratio.  The Guardian Smart-4 4U (UL-700K-4) earns 54.9 total points or 84% of the maximum mark.  Such a kit with a very high probability will meet the expectations of even a very demanding user. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <strong>Guard Smart-4 4U (UL-700K-4)</strong> <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Criterion</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>Coefficient</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>Score</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>Evaluation</strong> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Packaging <br></td><td>  0.1 <br></td><td>  6 <br></td><td>  0.6 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Appearance <br></td><td>  0.8 <br></td><td>  9 <br></td><td>  7.2 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Workmanship <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  eight <br></td><td>  eight <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Completeness <br></td><td>  0.5 <br></td><td>  9 <br></td><td>  4.5 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Convenience of connection <br></td><td>  0.7 <br></td><td>  eight <br></td><td>  5.6 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  User's Manual <br></td><td>  0.5 <br></td><td>  eight <br></td><td>  four <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Image quality <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  7 <br></td><td>  7 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  User Interface Convenience <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  9 <br></td><td>  9 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Price <br></td><td>  0.9 <br></td><td>  ten <br></td><td>  9 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>final grade</strong> <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  <strong>54.9</strong> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>% of maximum score</strong> <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  <strong>84</strong> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>Guard AHD Wagon</b> <br><br>  The kit comes in a minimalist-strict cardboard box (Fig. 54).  All elements of the package are designed in the same style (Fig. 55).  Alas, such packaging does not give the user an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãwhat is inside, and the florid clarifying inscriptions in English speak even less. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/96b/4e0/bd8/96b4e0bd822b47f99dd2d826f30a4a59.JPG"><br>  Fig.  54.

Delivery Set of Guardians AHD Wagon <br><br>  The appearance of the recorder in a strict black case is very good (Fig. 56). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/436/3b4/f79/4363b4f793ed44c083bb1b8139ed689a.JPG"><br>  Fig.  56.

Front and rear panel of the DVR Video recorder Guard AHD Universal <br><br>  The recorder housing is not designed for wall mounting.  In order for readers to have a basic idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow a modern recorder works, we present a photo of this model with the top cover removed (Fig. 58). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bbf/bf4/836/bbfbf4836d5f47df994e29d1f7f459c8.JPG"><br>  Fig.  58. Video Recorder Inside, Guard AHD Wagon <br><br>  As you can see, the device consists of an electronics board with soldered interface connectors, power cords and a SATA cable for a connected hard disk, an interface cable for the front control panel and this panel itself, and the housing itself.  The design of all recorders is similar. <br>  Kit cameras are probably the most beautiful of their tested.  Plus, their assembly is absolutely perfect (Fig. 59). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c4b/22e/1e1/c4b22e1e16bd420b8eabe3289a6ced30.JPG"><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8a9/a2e/85f/8a9a2e85fc534e95aa72fc334594eb2f.JPG"><br>  Fig.  59. Guards AHD Station Wagon Kit <br><br>  There is still one drawback in the cameras: the unregulated lens visor.  But fixing the position of the camera on the bracket is carried out without any screwdrivers and keys, using a large tightening nut at the base of the bracket leg.  Conveniently. <br>  Cable cameras unconventional gray.  This introduces a slight color imbalance, but it also has a positive side: you can immediately see where this cable is connected to the combo coaxial cable / power cord.  If the power of the camera is pulled out, it immediately catches the eye. <br><br>  A single power supply unit with a solid output power of 12V * 4A (Fig. 60) is used to power the recorder and cameras with the kit.  Again, it is convenient, in the place of installation of the recorder do not need additional sockets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b6a/15d/340/b6a15d3406154165ae6b37af519db762.JPG"><br>  Fig.60.  Power unit Guard AHD Universal <br><br>  The power output and the splitter are absolutely standard here, so they are well compatible with other equipment. <br>  With the instructions, the situation is not important.  A small brochure in English is unlikely to explain much to a user who, for the first time, independently installs a video surveillance system.  The recorder is controlled from the front panel or the mouse, there is no remote in the kit. <br><br>  The recorder, the only one tested, started by default from the menu in English.  However, the Russian language is much clearer for the domestic user in the settings options.  So the difficulties in setting up video surveillance should not arise even among those who played English on a mobile phone, in a sea battle, points, tic-tac-toe, cards or football. <br><br>  On the whole, the menu (Fig. 61) resembles that used in the recorder of the Guardian Smart-4 4U kit (UL-700K-4).  This is not surprising, given that the supplier of this technology is one. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e4/c99/b32/4e4c99b3260f4469b7d9e67cf0b5992b.jpg"><br>  Fig.  61. The main menu of the DVR Guard AHD Universal <br><br>  In general, the settings menu is very intuitive, convenient and provides all the possibilities for setting up video surveillance.  Record and view the time schedule or the definition of movement, identifying attempts to close and turn off the camera, etc.  (Fig. 62). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/9c3/e12/362/9c3e123623b4420c9a5c1e8e3a197a6c.jpg"><br>  Fig.  62. Setting up alarm events Guard AHD Wagon <br><br>  The recorder keeps a detailed event log (Fig. 63), and you can always see if the guards did not interfere with the operation of the device, for example, having decided to have a party in the absence of office staff. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d0b/356/d1e/d0b356d1e6bf4c2492c3c60994c2daed.jpg"><br>  Fig.  63. Event Log Guard AHD Universal <br><br>  There is a cloud service and remote viewing of cameras from mobile devices.  For easy introduction of the unique ID code of the registrar to the mobile gadget, a QR code for photographing is applied to the instruction sheet. <br><br>  A significant advantage of this kit is the use of high resolution analog cameras (AHD).  The difference in the quality of the image literally immediately catches the eye, detailing the picture is much better!  The AHD camera allows you to examine in detail the structure of the hairstyle of a person at a distance of several meters, not to mention the clarity of the face.  Analog cameras noticeably lose when it comes to identifying such small details.  The advantage of AHD surveillance becomes especially noticeable in the evening and at night: when the AHD infrared light is working, the camera makes it possible to distinguish the facial features of a person at a distance of several meters, whereas ordinary analog cameras capture only very vague silhouettes.  Only the camera vertically placed on the floor of the AHD managed to display the texture of the suspended ceiling in the room in detail, while ordinary analog cameras instead of drawing with fine details showed just a uniform background.  Actually, even one glance at the differences in the AHD image is enough to understand - it is for such cameras the near future.  Standard CCTV cameras are simply unable to compete with AHD in the image.  Given that the price of a high-resolution kit is almost on par with conventional analog systems, the purchase of AHD becomes more than justified.  For example, the cost of a set of Guards AHD Universal is much less than what is asked for a set of KGUARD Security and is approximately equal to the cost of the ALFA DVR Kit or Hikvision DS-J143i 4 Out.  If you compare it with IP cameras of similar HD quality, then AHD equipment is also significantly cheaper, plus it is easier to install and configure. <br><br>  <b>Conclusion</b> <br><br>  Guard AHD Universal made a very pleasant impression of the quality of performance, balance of characteristics and, most importantly, image quality.  The overall assessment of the kit was reduced by the English manual and modest equipment.  However, this turned out to be the best technical solution from all tested equipment.  If you need to buy today a video surveillance kit that meets the requirements of tomorrow, you should choose the Guard AHD Universal.  Moreover, for the high quality of the image almost does not have to pay extra a penny.  In total, this kit scores 54.2 points or 83% of the maximum mark.  The kit will maximally satisfy the requests of users who keep up with progress and who want to install the most up-to-date equipment. <br><table><tbody><tr><td>  <strong>Guard AHD Wagon</strong> <br></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Criterion</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>Coefficient</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>Score</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>Evaluation</strong> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Packaging <br></td><td>  0.1 <br></td><td>  eight <br></td><td>  0.8 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Appearance <br></td><td>  0.8 <br></td><td>  9 <br></td><td>  7.2 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Workmanship <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  9 <br></td><td>  9 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Completeness <br></td><td>  0.5 <br></td><td>  6 <br></td><td>  3 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Convenience of connection <br></td><td>  0.7 <br></td><td>  eight <br></td><td>  5.6 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  User's Manual <br></td><td>  0.5 <br></td><td>  3 <br></td><td>  1.5 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Image quality <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  ten <br></td><td>  ten <br></td></tr><tr><td>  User Interface Convenience <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  9 <br></td><td>  9 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Price <br></td><td>  0.9 <br></td><td>  9 <br></td><td>  8.1 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>final grade</strong> <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  <strong>54.2</strong> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>% of maximum score</strong> <br></td><td></td><td></td><td>  <strong>83</strong> <br></td></tr></tbody></table><br>  <b>Results</b> <br><br>  The Guardian Smart-4 4U (UL-700K-4) became the winner of the comparative test of video surveillance kits.  Generous equipment, attractive appearance, good construction, intuitive and friendly menu allowed this kit to score the maximum number of points - 54.9.  By the totality of characteristics, not to mention the cost - this is the best option for the organization of video surveillance.  Acquisition of the Guardians Smart-4 4U (UL-700K-4) would be a good choice, especially if you are trying to save a budget in a time of crisis. <br><br>  The second place with 54.2 points is occupied by the set of Guardians AHD Universal.  Excellent design and especially improved image quality make this set worth seeing.  Even with the second place in the final rating of the Guardian AHD Universal kit, you can safely assign the definition of ‚ÄúBest Buy‚Äù.  At a comparable price to the other sets, the AHD quality, dramatically transforming the video image for the better, is offered here for free.  It was this kit that was finally decided to be used for the needs of our organization, and the rest of the kits were to be returned to the sellers. <br><br>  Impressions of the beautiful Hikvision DS-J143i 4 Out bundle slightly tainted the flawed software: hardware problems when connecting equipment and an ambiguous settings menu.  However, even with this in mind, the kit scored 44.9 total points and gets a well-deserved third place. <br><br>  ALFA DVR Kit OUTdoors 4 H264 and KGUARD Security Easy Link close the top five.  Despite the beautiful packaging, the hardware content of these kits is disappointing.  Both sets use cheap cameras.  In this case, the ALFA DVR Kit OUTdoors camera build quality is just disgusting.  The KGUARD Security Easy Link kit builds better cameras, but the recorder has significant security issues with access to video surveillance options.  It is not possible to recommend these kits for purchase.  Moreover, the price of these sets is clearly too high for a typical Chinese "double bass". <br><br>  <b>Comparative table of tested video surveillance kits</b> <br><table border="1"><tbody><tr><td>  <strong>Kit name</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>ALFA DVR Kit OUTdoors 4 H264 (ASS-DVRout264H)</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>Hikvision DS-J143i 4 Out</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>KGUARD Security Easy Link (EL821-4HW212B)</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>Guard Smart-4 4U (UL-700K-4)</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>Guard AHD Wagon</strong> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number and type of video inputs <br></td><td>  4 BNC <br></td><td>  4 BNC <br></td><td>  8 BNC <br></td><td>  4 BNC <br></td><td>  4 BNC <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Type of video outputs <br></td><td>  BNC / VGA / HDMI <br></td><td>  BNC / VGA / HDMI <br></td><td>  BNC / VGA / HDMI <br></td><td>  BNC / VGA / HDMI <br></td><td>  VGA / HDMI <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number and type of audio inputs <br></td><td>  4 RCA <br></td><td>  1 RCA <br></td><td>  2 RCA <br></td><td>  2 RCA <br></td><td>  1 RCA <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number and type of audio outputs <br></td><td>  1 RCA <br></td><td>  1 RCA <br></td><td>  1 RCA <br></td><td>  1 RCA <br></td><td>  1 RCA <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number of USB 2.0 ports (common / front panel) <br></td><td>  3/1 <br></td><td>  2/0 <br></td><td>  2/1 <br></td><td>  2/2 <br></td><td>  2/0 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Industrial Interface RS485 <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  not <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  not <br></td><td>  not <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Ethernet <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  there is <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number of cameras included <br></td><td>  four <br></td><td>  four <br></td><td>  four <br></td><td>  four <br></td><td>  four <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Camera resolution <br></td><td>  700TVL <br></td><td>  700TVL <br></td><td>  600TVL <br></td><td>  700TVL <br></td><td>  800TVL <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Resolution <br><br>  videotapes <br></td><td>  960H (960x576), D1 (704x576), CIF (352x288), QCIF (176x144) <br></td><td>  960H (960x576), D1 (704x576), CIF (352x288), QCIF (176x144) <br></td><td>  960H (960x576), D1 (704x576), CIF (352x288), QCIF (176x144) <br></td><td>  960H (960x576), D1 (704x576), CIF (352x288), QCIF (176x144) <br></td><td>  720p (1280x720), 960H (960x576), D1 (704x576), CIF (352x288), QCIF (176x144) <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number of power supplies <br></td><td>  2 <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  2 <br></td><td>  2 <br></td><td>  one <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Remote control <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  not <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  not <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Mouse <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  there is <br></td><td>  there is <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Combined coaxial cable / power cord for cameras, 18 m. <br></td><td>  4 things. <br></td><td>  4 things. <br></td><td>  4 things. <br></td><td>  4 things. <br></td><td>  4 things. <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Price, $ <br></td><td>  279 <br></td><td>  286 <br></td><td>  435 <br></td><td>  243 <br></td><td>  279 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>Score, points</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>33.3</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>44.9</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>34.6</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>54.9</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>54.2</strong> <br></td></tr><tr><td>  <strong>% of maximum rating</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>51</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>69</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>53</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>84</strong> <br></td><td>  <strong>83</strong> <br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364617/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364617/</a></p>
