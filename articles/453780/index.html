Our clients are not only advanced companies, but also beginners.  Therefore, I often talk not only about Grandstream lines, but also about some basic principles of SIP telephony.  And the result of my consultations and my support was this article.  I tried to tell both general information and interesting details.  I hope the information will be interesting - this is my first experience writing articles. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So, if you decide to switch to SIP-telephony, or want to replace a failed or outdated device with a new one, then you will definitely need IP phones.  This article is written to help you understand the diversity of the <a href="http://www.grandstream.ru/">Grandstream Networks</a> phone lines and select the best device for yourself or your employees. <br><br>  Grandstream has 6 categories of IP phones - Basic, Mid-Range, High-End, Premium, DECT and Wi-Fi phones.  In this article I will examine the three categories of IP phones - Basic, Mid-Range and High-End.  They differ in price range, appearance and, of course, functionality.  High-end phones, for example, have the greatest functionality, have a presentable appearance, but their price range is appropriate.  But we will go in order and consider each category separately.

    <h1>  Basic IP phones </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ug/n0/km/ugn0kmz_y2ekxw473ocezaykuqk.png"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 1. Basic IP phones</font></i> <br><br>  The IP series of GXP1600 phones was created specifically for small and medium businesses, as well as for home users.  These simple devices have a user-friendly interface, support for all basic IP telephony features, and maximum ease of use. <br><br>  This category of phones consists of six models: GXP1610, GXP1615, GXP1620, GXP1625, GXP1628, GXP1630. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nx/dp/vp/nxdpvpwyojhf8fz-u3cqqt6ee3g.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 2. GXP1610 / GXP1615</font></i> <br><br>  The GXP1610 and GXP1615 phones differ only in that the GXP1615 supports PoE (Power-over-Ethernet) technology, which will power the device from a network cable, in addition to the power supply.  Compared to the other devices of the categories we are considering, only these phones have no backlight and no support for HD Audio. <br><br>  These models support one SIP account and two lines, which will allow to assign them one internal number and process two calls simultaneously.  They also support three-way audio conferencing and have a dual 10 / 100Mbps network interface (LAN and PC).  Using the PC connector is very convenient if the employee‚Äôs workplace has a connection to the local network for only one computer.  When the computer is connected with a network cable to the PC phone port, the phone will function as a switch and an additional port on the main switch will not be required.  Absolutely all phones of the categories Basic, Mid-Range, High-End and Premium support this mode. <br><br>  Another feature that is available on all Grandstream desk phones is the port for connecting an RJ9 headset.  But it is necessary to make a small reservation.  The manufacturer has tested many types of headsets.  Their support is guaranteed and you can study this list for phones of the 16th series <a href="http://www.grandstream.com/sites/default/files/Resources/gxp16xx_headset_compatibility.pdf">here</a> , and for all other phones <a href="http://www.grandstream.com/sites/default/files/Resources/gxp21xx_17xx_headsetcompatibility.pdf">here</a> . <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3w/ym/dv/3wymdvuxojpn2jyvgqm8mpirwne.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 3. GXP1620 / GXP1625</font></i> <br><br>  The GXP1620 and GXP1625 also differ only in that the GXP1625 has PoE support.  And I note that of all the lines of phones, only two models - GXP1610 and GXP1620 do not have support for this technology. <br><br>  The GXP1620 and GXP1625 models support two SIP accounts and two lines, have screen backlighting, support for HD Audio, three-way audio conferencing and dual 10 / 100Mbps network interface. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/q9/kx/ui/q9kxuirjlpwbl5l0qq_llankww8.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 4. GXP1628</font></i> <br><br>  The GXP1628 model is similar to the GXP1625 model except for the presence of eight MPK (Multi-Purpose Keys) keys with the BLF function, which allows you to monitor the busy state of your colleagues' telephones.  Multitasking MPK keys allow you to perform the most frequent actions with one touch.  As a rule, these keys are assigned a quick call to the most frequently dialed subscribers, or call transfer, which allows you not to store phone numbers in memory and not to waste time searching for them in the phone book.  Having shortcuts makes daily work with an IP phone much easier, especially for employees making many phone calls.  Also, this model differs from the GXP1625 in the presence of a gigabit network port. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/3m/i9/ka/3mi9kauuiuujadl2s_jvpsucjsc.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 5. GXP1630</font></i> <br><br>  A model GXP1630 is similar to the apparatus GXP1628, but also has its differences.  The GXP1630 has support for three SIP accounts, three lines and can organize a four-way audio conference. <br><br>  For convenience, here is a general table of comparison for the Basic IP category of phones: <br><br>  <i><font color="gray">Table 1. Basic IP Phone Comparison</font></i> <div class="scrollable-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>  Parameter / Model <br></td><td>  GXP1610 / GXP1615 <br></td><td>  GXP1625 / GXP1620 <br></td><td>  GXP1628 <br></td><td>  GXP1630 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Screen backlight <br></td><td>  Not <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td></tr><tr><td>  PoE technology support <br></td><td>  No Yes <br></td><td>  No Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number of lines <br></td><td>  2 <br></td><td>  2 <br></td><td>  2 <br></td><td>  3 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number of SIP accounts <br></td><td>  one <br></td><td>  2 <br></td><td>  2 <br></td><td>  3 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Hd audio <br></td><td>  Not <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td></tr><tr><td>  BLF keys <br></td><td>  Not <br></td><td>  Not <br></td><td>  eight <br></td><td>  eight <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Conferencing <br></td><td>  3 <br></td><td>  3 <br></td><td>  3 <br></td><td>  four <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Network interfaces <br></td><td>  10/100 Mbit <br></td><td>  10/100 Mbit <br></td><td>  10/100/1000 <br>  Mbps <br></td><td>  10/100/1000 <br>  Mbps <br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><h1>  Mid-Range IP Phones </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/re/pf/di/repfdiiodq19nvlludaiabzihw0.png"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 6. Mid-Range IP Phones</font></i> <br><br>  IP phones of the GXP1700 series are intended for small and medium business.  These stylish devices have all the necessary capabilities in demand in growing organizations.  At the same time, the GXP1700 series devices have a reasonable price, which reduces the burden on the budget of companies.  In addition to the functionality and price, the phones have excellent design and well-thought-out ergonomics, which makes it a pleasure to work with them. <br><br>  This category of phones consists of four phones: GXP1760, GXP1760w, GXP1780 and GXP1782.  Immediately, I note that the GXP1760w phone has a built-in dual-band Wi-Fi module, so it belongs to Wi-Fi phones and we will take a closer look at it in another article. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ae/_m/96/ae_m965ji8562qraxtwzibhpo58.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 7. GXP1760</font></i> <br><br>  Let's start with the phone GXP1760.  This model has a two-color backlit LCD screen, support for three SIP accounts, six lines and the ability to organize a five-way audio conference.  Six keys on the sides of the display and the ability to switch four pages on the home screen with the right and left navigation keys give a total of 24 virtual BLF keys <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/p1/xt/pj/p1xtpjpxgchag4ax8toz_f1paqw.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 8. BLF keys</font></i> <br><br>  For personalization capabilities, the GXP1760 supports various ringtones, as well as web applications such as weather forecasts.  Also, the GXP1760 is equipped with a Kensington Security Slot security port to prevent it from being stolen from public places such as checkpoints, hotel lounges, reception desks and others.  Two 10/100 Mbps ports are used to connect to the network; the device can be configured either via a web interface or using various auto-tuning technologies: <br><br><ul><li>  Auto Provisioning when using IP-PBX from Grandstream; <br></li><li>  self-loading .xml configuration files via DHCP option 66; <br></li><li>  support for auto tuning services 3CX and Broadsoft; <br></li><li>  The Grandstream Automated Provisioning System (GAPS) is an automated system that allows IT administrators and telecom operators to directly and securely control the provision of devices and optimizes the massive deployment of Grandstream products from a central control panel. <br></li></ul><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6j/eo/f9/6jeof9ewmhzja_v7fvixe5sbmpa.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 9. GXP1780 / 1782</font></i> <br><br>  Model GXP1780 differs from GXP1760 in that it has support for four SIP accounts and eight lines.  This model has eight physical BLF keys, and the ability to browse the home screen gives 32 virtual BLF keys.  The GXP1782 model differs from the GXP1780 model only in a gigabit network interface. <br><br>  In addition to the RJ9 port for connecting a headset, the 1700 series phones have a separate EHS port for external EHS adapters. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hn/pp/bi/hnppbi7delaobd2i6pjwik6cdoy.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 10. Port for EHS adapters</font></i> <br><br>  For convenience, I will give a general table of comparison for the category Mid-Range IP phones: <br><br>  <i><font color="gray">Table 2. Comparison of Mid-Range IP Phones</font></i> <br><div class="scrollable-table"><table><tbody><tr><td>  Parameter / Model <br></td><td>  GXP1760 <br></td><td>  GXP1780 <br></td><td>  GXP1782 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Screen backlight <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td></tr><tr><td>  PoE technology support <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number of lines <br></td><td>  6 <br></td><td>  eight <br></td><td>  eight <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Number of SIP accounts <br></td><td>  3 <br></td><td>  four <br></td><td>  four <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Hd audio <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td><td>  Yes <br></td></tr><tr><td>  BLF keys (physical / virtual) <br></td><td>  6/24 <br></td><td>  8/32 <br></td><td>  8/32 <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Conferencing <br></td><td>  five <br></td><td>  five <br></td><td>  five <br></td></tr><tr><td>  Network interfaces <br></td><td>  10 / 100Mbps <br></td><td>  10 / 100Mbps <br></td><td>  10/100 / 1000Mbps <br></td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><h1>  High-end IP Phones </h1><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/g0/da/xa/g0daxam-chk3pqxhezuceth1aeg.png"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 11. High-End IP Phones</font></i> <br><br>  The high-quality GXP2100 series IP phones are designed for users who need advanced telephony features.  These devices have rich functionality.  Features such as a high-quality HD speaker, a clear color display, the ability to customize desktop wallpapers, various BLF key combinations and support for additional expansion panels, built-in Bluetooth, PoE, gigabit network ports on all models - all these are distinctive features of advanced IP phones of the series GXP2100. <br><br>  This category includes 5 phone models: GXP2130, GXP2135, GXP2140, GXP2160 and GXP2170. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/mt/54/dk/mt54dke4recjuykulxbqo8bwmng.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 12. GXP2130</font></i> <br><br>  The first model in this line is the GXP2130.  This phone has a 2.8-inch color LCD display and a resolution of 320x240 pixels.  It supports three lines and three SIP accounts and provides the opportunity to organize a four-way audio conference.  A distinctive feature of this phone is the presence of eight MPK keys with the BLF function.  However, by analogy with Mid-Range phones, High-End devices also have the ability to configure BLF virtual keys.  The presence of three physical keys to the left of the display and four pages for scrolling add up to 12 virtual BLF keys in addition to the eight MPK keys. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/nl/y9/xz/nly9xz-yl-6no-q8o2gqu9oaqmg.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 13. BLF keys</font></i> <br><br>  I'll tell you separately why you need Bluetooth in the phones of this series.  Bluetooth technology is present in all High-End 21XX series phones and greatly expands the capabilities of the phone.  For starters, you can connect an external Bluetooth-headset, which will save you from "binding" to the phone, as it happens when using wired headsets.  In addition, it is possible to connect a mobile phone to an IP phone. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/8j/vo/-q/8jvo-qkjkqsstzjhtd6r6nbtyte.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 14. Mobile Phone Account</font></i> <br><br>  With this scheme, the IP phone itself will act as a headset for a cell phone.  When connected, the mobile phone‚Äôs ‚Äúaccount‚Äù will automatically appear on the IP phone, and it will be possible to make calls from the IP phone without using a mobile phone, this is the so-called Hands-free mode.  Incoming calls to the mobile phone will also be displayed on the IP phone.  And if you need to call a contact that already exists on your mobile phone, you can be helped by the ability to synchronize contacts between an IP phone and a mobile phone via Bluetooth. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/gn/wp/2r/gnwp2rrdyl0lmuoomgw_taph3ry.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 15. GXP2135</font></i> <br><br>  The next model is the GXP2135.  It differs from the previous one in the number of lines, SIP accounts, the presence of a larger number of BLF keys and the absence of MPK keys.  This phone supports eight lines, and four SIP accounts.  The BLF keys on this phone are eight, and the ability to scroll through the home screen increases the number of these keys to 32. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/64/12/aq/6412aqhrnnq7pyqwaipsahknxcg.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 16. GXP2140</font></i> <br><br>  The three latest models of phones GXP2140, GXP2160 and GXP2170 have an enlarged screen.  Its dimensions: 4.3 inches and a resolution of 480x272 pixels.  The GXP2140 supports four lines, four SIP accounts, and can organize a five-way audio conference.  Four keys to the left of the screen with the BLF function, by analogy with other models, make it possible to create 16 virtual BLF keys. <br><br>  A distinctive feature of this model is that it can be connected to the expansion panel GXP2200EXT. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/-y/ks/g3/-yksg3xk33cfbz7uw90ffzbwdzs.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 17. GXP2200EXT</font></i> <div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ek/6n/qe/ek6nqeyverkjizl3bzz60vqhet8.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 18. GXP2140 and GXP2200EXT</font></i> <br><br>  The GXP2200EXT is an optional keypad with a graphic LCD display that provides additional functionality, flexibility and scalability of IP phones Grandstream GXP2140, GXP2170 and GXV3240.  The module has a large 128 x 384 graphic LCD display and 20 programmable keys (each key can be lit in two colors), and the ability to switch the screen gives 40 keys on one panel.  In total, up to four GXP2200EXT panels in a chain can be connected to Grandstream IP phones.  Thus, up to 160 shortcut keys are supported when using 4 expansion modules.  The expansion module is connected, receives power and is controlled by the phone, providing additional functionality immediately after connecting the module. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zp/hn/tn/zphntn2p7nba_umdegftuovxffo.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 19. GXP2160</font></i> <br><br>  Our next phone is the GXP2160.  It supports six lines, six SIP accounts and the organization of a five-way audio conference.  The six BLF keys to the left of the screen and the ability to scroll through the home screen add up to 24 virtual BLF keys.  This phone does not support connecting an additional expansion panel, but it has a similar built-in panel.  It has 24 MPK keys with BLF function. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/zu/-p/wa/zu-pwaxferleuons2alabexdtec.png" width="500" height="600"></div>  <i><font color="gray">Figure 20. GXP2170</font></i> <br><br>  Our top-end IP phone Grandstream GXP2170 supports 12 lines, 6 independent SIP accounts and is capable of organizing a five-way audio conference.  Thanks to the presence of 12 keys with the BLF function on the sides of the screen and the ability to scroll, you can configure up to 48 virtual BLF keys.  Also, this phone supports the connection of an additional expansion panel GXP2200EXT, so it is perfect for employees who actively use the telephone in their work. <br><br>  And so that you can clearly see the differences between the phones of this series, I will again give a comparison table: <br><br>  <i><font color="gray">Table 3.
