  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Julian Assange: Google is not what it seems (part five, penultimate)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> The penultimate part of the translation of the text of Julian Assange on Google and its manual.  Here the story goes mainly about Eric Schmidt, his political ideas and even will be a little bit about Russia.  By the way, I can not say that this moment reveals something incredible, but he let me look at the last foreign policy adventure a little wider.  However, it is in my humble.  Welcome under cat. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/024/b41/720/024b417206914900ba9e01a8dceb9adf.png"><br>  <em>Eric Schmidt is the main speaker at the Big Ideas for a New America conference held by the New America Foundation, where Schmidt chairs and is the largest sponsor, May 16, 2014.</em> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Eric Schmidt was born in Washington, DC, where his father worked as a professor and was an economist at the Nixon Treasury.  He attended high school in Arlington, Virginia, and later received an engineering degree from Princeton.  In 1979, he traveled west to Berkeley, where he received his doctoral (PhD) degree <em>.</em>  <em>the wiki <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D1%2582,_%25D0%25AD%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">speaks</a> of a master‚Äôs degree, albeit with <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B4%25D1%2582,_%25D0%25AD%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA">reference</a> to Kommersant, for some reason</em> ] before joining Sun Microsystems spin-office of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3Dn6dIQ6KK3og">Stanford / Berkeley</a> in 1983.  Sixteen years later, he left the company, having become one of the performing executives. <br><br>  Sun also had significant contracts with the US government, but only as long as Schmidt was in Utah, as CEO of Novell, whose records show that he had a strategic interest in the Washington political class.  The financial records of the federal [election] campaign say that on January 6, 1999, Schmidt twice donated $ 1,000 to the Republican senator from Yuta, Orin Hatch.  That same day, Schmidt‚Äôs wife, Wendy, also donated twice a thousand to Senator Hatch.  By the beginning of 2001, more than a dozen other politicians and political action committees [ <em>approx.</em>  <em><a href="https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/">PACs</a> , or the ‚ÄúPolitical Action Committee,‚Äù unite to fund election campaigns, in particular for implicit financial support from specific politicians</em> ], including Al Gore, George W. Bush, <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A4%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD,_%25D0%2594%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B9%25D1%258D%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD">Dianne Feinstein</a> and Hillary Clinton received a total of injections from Schmidt more than 100 thousand dollars.  By 2013, Eric Schmidt, now publicly associated with the White House of Barack Obama, has become more calculating.  Eight Republicans and eight Democrats were directly funded by two PACs.  In April, $ 32,300 was sent to the Republican Senatorial Committee.  A month later, the same amount, 32,300, went to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.  Why Schmidt donated totally single sums of money to two political parties for $ 64,600 remains a mystery.  [ <em>approx.</em>  <em>Schmidt payment data was obtained from the <a href="http://opensecrets.org/indivs">OpenSecrets.org</a> and the <a href="http://fec.gov/finance/disclosure/norindsea.shtml">US Federal Election Commission</a> .</em>  <em>The list of political donate by Eric Schmidt in the amount of 116 716.00 can be found <a href="http://archive.today/yjXoi">here</a></em> ].

      Also in 1999, Schmidt joined another council: the New America Foundation (New America Foundation), a well-connected association of centrists.  The Foundation and one hundred of its employees worked using their own network of national security, foreign policy and technology experts to post hundreds of articles and review materials per year.  By 2008, Schmidt took the place of chairman of the board there.  As of 2013, the main sponsors of the New America Foundation, each of which has invested over a million dollars, <a href="http://archive.is/3FnFm">are</a> Eric and Wendy Schmidt, the United States Department of State, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.  Further in the ranking of contributors are Google, USAID (United State Agency for International Development, United States Agency for International Development) and Radio Free Asia [ <em>app.</em>  <em>Radio <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B0%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BE_%25D0%25A1%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B1%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B4%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%2590%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">Free Asia</a> is a non-profit organization, something like Voice of America, only for the Asian region;</em>  <em>partially funded from the US budget</em> ]. <br><br>  Schmidt‚Äôs participation in the New America Foundation puts him firmly in the chain of Washington ruling circles.

At the time of writing, it is everywhere, <a href="https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems/">urging</a> Obama to respond to the Ukrainian crisis not only by deploying US forces under cover in the country, but also dropping bombs on Syria, on the grounds that this could serve as a message to Russia and China.  Together with Schmidt, she is a member of the <a href="http://archive.is/PeJGc">Bilderberg Conference of</a> 2013, and also sits on the Council of Foreign Affairs of the US Department of State. <br><br>  [ <em>approx.</em>  <em>‚ÄúThe solution to the Ukrainian crisis is partially in Syria.</em>  <em>It is time for US President Barack Obama to show that he can go on the offensive by using force in conditions other than secret drones or undercover operations.</em>  <em>The result could be a change in strategic calculations not only in Damascus, but also in Moscow, not to mention Beijing and Tokyo. ‚ÄùAnne-Marie Slaughter,‚Äú <a href="http://archive.is/GiLng">Stopping Russia Starts in Syria</a> ‚Äù, Project Syndicate, April 23, 2014</em> ] <br><br>  There is nothing that would speak of Schmidt‚Äôs political unluckyness.  I was too impatient, having noticed at first the political unpretentiousness of an engineer from Silicon Valley, seeing in him a graduate of the information department from the West Coast as a relic of the good old days.  However, this is not the person who attends the Bilderberg conferences for four years in a row, who regularly visits the White House or conducts ‚Äútalks at the hearth‚Äù at the World Economic Forum in Davos.  The emergence of Schmidt as ‚ÄúForeign Minister‚Äù from Google makes lush and ceremonial visits along the geopolitical fault line - and he has not appeared from nowhere;  it was foreshadowed by years of assimilation with American government networks of reputation and influence. <br><br>  On a personal level, Schmidt and Cohen are great people.  But the chairman of Google‚Äôs board is the classic ‚Äúhead of the industry,‚Äù with all the ideological baggage attached to this role.  Schmidt is ideally suited for his place: at the point where centrist, liberal and imperialist aspirations are found in American political life.  Apparently, Google bosses sincerely believe in the civilized power of enlightened multinational corporations and they see this mission as the continuous formation of the world according to the common sense of the ‚Äúgenerous superpower‚Äù.  They will tell you that the breadth of views is a virtue, but all the prospects of striving into the depths of American foreign policy will remain unnoticed by them.  This is the impenetrable commonplace "don't be evil."  They believe they are doing good.  And that's the problem. <br><br>  <b>More information:</b> <br>  <a href="https://wikileaks.org/google-is-not-what-it-seems">Original</a> excerpt on WikiLeaks <br>  "When Google Met WikiLeaks" in <a href="http://www.orbooks.com/catalog/when-google-met-wikileaks/%3Futm_source%3Dnewsweek%26utm_medium%3Dserial%26utm_campaign%3Dgoogle_met_wikileaks">its entirety</a> ($ 10) <br><br>  Personally, I didn‚Äôt notice the <a href="https://vc.ru/n/eric-schmidt-pentagon">news</a> of March 2: Eric Schmidt was <a href="http://www.defense.gov/News/News-Releases/News-Release-View/Article/684201/statement-by-pentagon-press-secretary-peter-cook-on-the-establishment-of-the-de">appointed</a> head of the innovation council at the US Department of Defense.  In short: the advice will give recommendations on the development and implementation of all technological pieces, and created due to the recent history of Apple / FBI.
