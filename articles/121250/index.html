      I live in a small apartment, but apparently I was really lucky with my neighbors and far enough from noisy roads and trams.  Perfect silence after the repair added double-glazed windows.  I think that you have already guessed, and the first thing I put at the forefront is noise, or rather its absence. <br><br>  The second most important factor is energy consumption, which is especially reminiscent of this annually growing price tag for electricity. <br>  The third is compact placement, not a critical, but desirable requirement for a new HTPC. <br>  And, of course, so that all needs have enough performance. <br><br><h5>  And what is the need? </h5><br>  - show on TV any video format, up to 720 / 1080p; <br>  - keep hundreds of gigabytes of media data; <br>  - download / distribute torrents; <br>  - perform the role of a home web server for development; <br>  - perform the role of a VPN server as a cure for paranoia when working in public Wi-Fi networks from a mobile; <br>  - small specific automation tasks, usually working on a schedule at night. <br><br>  <b>2010. The</b> budget and the selection strategy were not defined at all, it should be understood as a desire to get more for less money, and with minimal effort in terms of searches. <br><br><h5>  Epoch Atom. </h5><br>  I was interested in this particular line because of its low power consumption and the expected passive cooling system "in stock". <br>  The choice in the shops of my city was rather limited in this class, and I did not want to wait for delivery from somewhere.  The choice fell on ZOTAC IONITX-CE. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bbbc92e8/0e1f6578/36026565/0202a6b8.png"><br><br>  It seemed to me the perfect solution: <br>  - Intel Atom 230 processor; <br>  - NVIDIA MCP79 (ION) chipset; <br>  - mini-ITX form factor; <br>  - 3 SATA 3Gb / s connectors; <br>  - Up to 4 GB of RAM; <br>  - external power supply 90 watts; <br>  the price was not very good, but the possibility of assembling the system without a single fan outweighed. <br><br>  Before the working PC, I didn‚Äôt have enough RAM for which I didn‚Äôt have to spend any additional time, I used the remaining bar from the whale GEIL DDR2-6400 2GB, and I inserted 1GB of OCZ in the second bank.  As a result, having received an unremarkable 2 + 1 configuration, both slats have radiators. <br><br><h5>  Body </h5><br>  It turned out all sad.  The choice of mini-ITX form factor cases was extremely poor.  I took this case (I don‚Äôt remember the name, I also forgive you for the quality of photographic material): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/2de44905/cacc10aa/b7c1f308/79ad0705.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/bd8fca25/51efe7ed/58a518d2/c2de606f.jpg"><br><br>  The case is not very compact, but it has a five-inch compartment and I absolutely don‚Äôt need a 250 watt power supply. <br><br><h5>  Assembly. </h5><br>  I can‚Äôt mention any special moments - it's simple.  I unscrewed and removed the BP casing away.  I installed the motherboard, stuck the slats of RAM ... oh, the hard drive. <br><br>  Winchester was chosen green - WD volume of 1.5TB, with 64MB of cache, with a low speed of rotation of the plates, based on reducing the only source of noise. <br><br>  On the side of the case there was a fan that was intentionally forgotten and not turned on. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/765213c3/a4779a4e/d25829ff/015ea8c7.jpg"><br><br>  Put, turned on.  First thoughts - quiet, very quiet.  The question of choosing a platform and software, I plan to describe a separate story, so back to the birds.  Long operation (remembering last summer) dictated the need to turn on the side cooler at low revs.  The overall temperature was satisfactory. <br><br><h5>  Upgrade. </h5><br>  The first thing that was purchased was Microsoft Remote Control w / Receiver for MCE: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/b23f5665/93ac027d/eb57a16d/7d20e9be.png"><br><br>  Convenient remote control, the only drawback I can call its battery gluttony, the likely reason is the button illumination. <br><br>  Wi-Fi module in PCI-E.  I wanted to use the HTPC link for laptop and mobile.  This time, I was patient and made an order on ebay.  A month later, the module successfully arrived, was inserted and worked faithfully, before purchasing a router with Wi-Fi, with support for n. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/e4c0f16c/30162124/fea6eab1/d969c7bd.png"><br><br>  As a conclusion, I want to say that the described configuration fulfills all the demands made on it to this day and continues to delight, carrying multimedia comfort.  Today I would like to add, perhaps, support for USB3, a second network interface and, probably, a more nimble processor ... <br><br>  <i>PS The story was superficial, but I will be happy to answer any questions in the comments.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/121250/">https://habr.com/ru/post/121250/</a></p>
