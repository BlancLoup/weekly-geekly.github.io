      <b>‚ÄúStep into the Future‚Äù</b> is an Olympiad for high school students (10th and 11th), smart, ready to engage in scientific activities. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6f65cf90/74766a2b/e6dfdd63/9c9d45ae.png"><br><br>  It consists of two stages: <br><ul><li>  working on the project and protecting it before the commission </li><li>  writing physics olympiad </li></ul><br><br>  Based on the results of the first part (i.e., how many balls you will get for the defense), the participant is allowed either to the second stage or filtered out. <br><br>  It was a brief digression.  Now I will tell you how I passed all the stages. <br>  To begin with, I studied at the Lyceum at MSTU.  N. E. Bauman as much as 2 years.  Yes, they helped us, but they helped us only with the information that there is such an Olympiad and that with the help of it one can enter the university.  I have been programming since I was 13 years old, and now I am successfully working for one of the companies. <br><br>  First of all, I went to the office of the 354 main academic building.  There I left information that I want such and such for such a department of such a faculty.  It's simple. <br>  After 2 months it was necessary to submit the project annotation.  By this time, the participant should have already been given contacts by the supervisor, with whom, in fact, the participant is engaged in the project (I did everything myself).  I was writing off my email account, and in the end I decided on the theme of the project (thanks to Habr).  We came to the conclusion that I will be making an Arduino based robot, for this is cool and spectacular. <br><br>  So, I have already ordered <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardDuemilanove">arduino duemilanove</a> on ebay and I received it after a lot of time thanks to the Post of Russia.  Good stuff.  I tried to write a program that turns on and off the LED.  Well, cool.  What's next? <br>  Then I absolutely did not know what to do next with this board.  By searching on ebay, I found the wheeled platform mr.  basics. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cfe82b8a/fe2fbe14/b004406e/f08bb0d4.jpg"><br><br>  Yes, and I suddenly received it by mail.  Chinese useless platform.  In the end, she erased all the gears and she began to drive badly.  I had to order another. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/96425bc1/44ccff4b/5cc06fe0/13d1636a.jpg"><br><br>  Mr.  Basics I tried to connect to Arduino through transistors for a long time and hard, because the current didn‚Äôt have enough power to move the motors (I was pushed by my teacher, thanks to him, even though I started to understand circuit engineering a little).  But the power is still not enough.  Then I googled a motor shield for arduino, with which you can connect servos and motors.  And besides, the shield has its own class for the arduino IDE.  It really helped me.  Connecting is simple, writing code is also easy.  Now motors have earned. <br><br>  To control the motors you had to write your software.  I chose Qt.  A simple program was written, where there were 4 arrows.  By pressing, an array of data was sent through com-port to the board itself.  The array contained: the direction of the right motor, the speed of the right motor, the direction of the left motor, the speed of the left motor. <br><br>  Everything worked fine through the wire.  Now I started looking for radio modules.  Found some APC 220. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/0d6d0ea0/f5ba7c16/df5c7da7/56831c34.jpg"><br><br>  I ordered them on ebay.  The Chinese seller assured me that one module would be enough for me to control the arduina from the computer.  I was young and green, broke for a long time, but believed his perseverance.  And, suddenly!  It was necessary, of course, two modules.  In general, they profited on me.  He sent the second module to the wrong one (and I burned it), I had to look in Moscow. <br>  APC 220 is very difficult to connect, there is no documentation, I fought a week just to get it connected. <br><br>  Further, I was not enough, and I decided to connect the ultrasonic range finder in order to: <br><ol><li>  determine the distance to the first obstacle </li><li>  automatically stop in front of this obstacle in order not to damage such expensive equipment. </li></ol><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/4a29d0be/074abae5/3269a13f/be332f0c.jpg"><br><br>  For information on this module and in general for it thanks to Ilya Danilov (idanilov.ru).  He helped me a lot with setting up and connecting. <br><br>  In the end, this is a robot controlled via radio via PC: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/553/13e/0c8/55313e0c892e7b3f55c984f1b3c63416.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/26c/8c1/df9/26c8c1df90f57f5619465b5a68a25ca4.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/haOLd_GIApU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700191,15700253,15700256,15700259&amp;usg=ALkJrhiN2ebRyT3dgS3DCtXKYLkZot5UAw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  In February, it was necessary to submit an abstract for protection, which described the stages of development of the robot.  It turned out pages 20. He was reviewed and also put up balls.  In March, the defense was already held, following the results of which they were allowed to participate in a physics competition.  In May, the winners of the Olympiad were determined.  This year both prize winners and winners arrived at MSTU. <br><br>  Now I am a student of the Software Engineering Department of the Moscow State Technical University.  N. E. Bauman.  Thanks for attention. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126211/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126211/</a></p>
