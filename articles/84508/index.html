This question is discussed by many and opinions diverge ... Skeptics consider venturing to conquer the Russian-language Internet utopia, and opening a representative office in Moscow is a silly venture, someone evaluates the prospects and now thinks about how you can make money on all of this ... And yet the debate about the future of Facebook and in general, the prospects for social networks or the ‚Äútrend‚Äù that has taken place - the company celebrated its sixth anniversary in a record company - 400 million users.  Not a bad "corporateboy" ... <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Of course, the glade was captured by Vkontakte and Odnoklassniki, but Facebook already has 700,000 users in Facebook, which is also a lot ... Or not enough?  And here, according to marketers, another interest is included - the quality of the audience.  In a conversation about the immediate audience, Facebook is certainly more effective than the others, reflecting who its user is, allowing you to more likely segment your audience by interests and social status.  The advantage of any social community is to take the same Habrahabr - this is, of course, narrowly focused interests of the audience, which means that the advertiser working on these users will choose this network and will not lose ... The same trend of 2010, many experts believe, will strive to calculate the necessary audience, a group of people among the multimillion army of users, and also to influence them as effectively as possible.  For this will be created various services - "zamanuhi."  These ‚Äúlures‚Äù are becoming more interesting, it's nice to see them, appreciating the creative of marketers, rather than passing by the flashing banners (well, this is a separate story ...) <br><br>  Companies have seen an important piece, if you want to attract attention - become useful, in case of emergency - ‚Äúentertain‚Äù.  Already, you can find various applications and services in the same "Vkontakte", such chips were not long in coming and on Facebook.  Commercial application " <a href="http://bit.ly/cDm8Uk">Party Designer</a> " - an example of such an application.  By the way, if you believe the developers - they are among the first to develop a commercial Facebook application for Russia.

Simplicity can be attributed to the fact that the company is just starting to work with the Facebook audience, and then it will be better. <br>  My opinion is that in the near future, Russian applications will flood Facebook spaces as well as have already filled Vkontakte.  And commercial applications become one of the pioneers.  Why? <br><br>  Why, for example, not to make the same application for Vkontakte or My World - a social network from Mail.ru, which also supports applications?  There are several times more audiences - tens of millions, when there is only 0.7 million on Facebook. The answer lies precisely in the audience.  Since Facebook is still unpopular - only trendsetters use it, technically advanced people who are better off than the audience of Vkontakte or My World.  For the same reason, advertisers come to Habrahabr.  To hook a technically advanced audience to show the device first to advanced users. <br><br>  In the future, when the Facebook audience will not be so narrow and there will be at least five million, the social network will lose this advantage and those advertisers who work for the mass market will come.  However, those who have already invested in the presence in Facebook - they will grow and will benefit greatly. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/84508/">https://habr.com/ru/post/84508/</a></p>
