      Open the topic of free and open source edition called PyCharm Community Edition, and first of all the reasons for its appearance.  Recently, in the Python community, there has been a steady trend in the development of a language towards its widespread introduction into educational programs, that is, training in Python programming, as evidenced by the emergence of projects such as <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> .  The scientific community is increasingly choosing Python as the language for their research, which is clear from the growing number and size of conferences, such as <a href="http://conference.scipy.org/scipy2013/">SciPy</a> .  Also, Python has long been actively used in many open-source projects. <br><br>  JetBrains has long supported open source projects, both external and internal, such as the <a href="http://kotlin.jetbrains.org/">Kotlin</a> language.  Therefore, we could not ignore these characters from the Python developer community itself. <br><br>  We want everyone who is just starting to learn Python or is already using it in scientific or open source projects, can not only write in an amazing language, but also use powerful tools in the form of PyCharm Community Edition. <br><br>  That is why we decided to create this edition.  We hope it appeared on time and very helpful. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a4d/d37/219/a4dd37219432e91a1c04fffcacbb4e9d.png" align="right" alt="PyCharm 3 Community Edition.png">  <b>What is Community Edition?</b> <br><br>  PyCharm Community Edition is designed for developers who use pure Python.  This edition supports all the most important: an ‚Äúintelligent‚Äù code editor with support for the same clever auto-completion, all refactorings, code inspections, integration with most version control systems, a graphical debugger, and much more.  As you can see, all the most basic and most important is in Community Edition.  However, this edition does not support web frameworks, the ability to run and debug code on a remote or virtual machine, database and SQL support, charts, and many other advanced professional development tools. <br><br>  <b>What about Professional?</b> <br><br>  Professional is a full-featured edition, a community Edition superset that includes all the tools you need for the most productive professional development in Python and web development, including using a variety of libraries and frameworks.  This edition supports Django, Flask, Google App Engine.  In version 3.0, support for the SQLAlchemy, web2py and Pyramid frameworks has been added to this set. <br><br>  <b>Can you tell more about the differences between Community and Professional?</b> <br><br>  For convenience, we have created a special page with a matrix of the main differences between these two editions.  You can see it <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/editions_comparison_matrix.html">here</a> .  We emphasize the main point: PyCharm Professional Edition has support for all web frameworks, remote launch and debugging applications, including virtual machines, support for databases and SQL, class diagrams, and JavaScript support. <br><br>  <b>Is that all?</b> <br><br>  Of course, not all.  The PyCharm 3.0 release demonstrates an impressive list of new features introduced in the IDE.  Among them: <br><br><ul><li>  <b>A full-featured IDE terminal</b> that works for all platforms.  No more need to leave the IDE during development. </li><li>  <b>SQLAlchemy</b> toolkit support.  With the release of the new version, PyCharm knows much more about this library than before, thus providing a deeper analysis of the code for this library and, as a result, clever autocompletion when working with it. </li><li>  Support for <b>web2py</b> and <b>pyramid</b> frameworks.  PyCharm provides autocompletion and navigation specific for these frameworks, can create and recognize already existing projects, and supports the template languages ‚Äã‚Äãof these frameworks at the level of syntax highlighting and autocompletion. </li><li>  <b>New refactorings</b> , including inverting boolean variables, replacing duplicates when putting code into a method, converting a static method into a function and a method into a property. </li><li>  <b>Configurable language inserts</b> .  This functionality allows you to edit non-Python code inside string literals.  For example, the SQL code inside a string in Python. </li><li>  <b>New inspections for Python</b> , allowing in more detail and deeply investigate the code, finding suspicious and potentially dangerous places. </li><li>  Improved support for the <b>Django</b> framework. </li><li>  The ability to <b>track variables in an interactive Python-console</b> and a tool <b>for finding duplicates</b> in the code. </li><li>  Support for <b>PyQt</b> and <b>PyGTK</b> libraries.  Namely, PyCharm now knows more about the types used in these libraries, thereby providing code analysis using these libraries and auto-completion. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Where can I download?</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download">Download</a> and use the free Community Edition or try the Professional Edition for 30 days.  Read the <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/whatsnew/index.html">official review of innovations</a> in version 3.0. <br><br>  By the way, upgrading to version 3.0 of the Professional Edition is free for anyone who purchased a license after September 24, 2012. <br><br>  We'd love to hear your feedback, impressions and comments about the Community Edition and about the IDE as a whole! <br><br>  Program with pleasure! <br>  Your team JetBrains PyCharm </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/195078/">https://habr.com/ru/post/195078/</a></p>
