  <section class="page js-page"><h1>[A letter to the young] How to become successful, not to waste time, and make money on your favorite activity</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Students are happy.  School years will be the best memory for many.  Moments of joy, experiences and love will remain with them forever.  These are the last years when it is unnecessary to earn money to live and you can sleep before dinner without feeling like a bum. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  Every day I see my peers.  Many live as described above, and this does not mean that they are stupid.  Most of my friends are smart enough, but for some it can be said definitely.  Their record book is filled with footers, no less than the student‚Äôs piggy bank, and the teachers' authority is very high.  Any mother wants her daughter to meet with such a guy. <br><br>  But time passes, and these years will be really the best, because only at this time did they feel that they were doing everything right.  The future will tell the cruel truth.  It will strike the face of reality, but many will not even notice.  Groundhog Day - not fiction.  It shows how monotonous life is until we start doing the right things.

      Good students are not necessarily good specialists.  Remember the joke: <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúLet's write off the troeks.</i>  <i>Maybe sometime one of them will take you to work. ‚Äù</i> <br><br>  I do not advise to leave universities and create a business.  This is stupid without an understanding of the meaning.  Entrepreneurs were leaving universities, already having a good income.  They do not need a classical education.  It will cease to be necessary to you, when you understand what you want to do.  Educational institutions help young people to develop in their favorite direction, but try to find a group in which at least one third see themselves in their chosen profession. <br><br>  Many will be satisfied with the work of 5/2, credit and going to the movies with a girl (boyfriend) on weekends.  And you will be lucky, if the work will be fun.  More often, people are disappointed in their profession, and all because of the dreams that students dreamed of all their years of study. <br><br>  I dispelled my own pretty quickly.  In the second year, when he worked as a programmer for half a year.  I did it, and I earned decent money, but I found pleasure in another.  At this point, education has faded into the background and development has begun.  It is like a feeling when you grabbed fate by the tail and you don‚Äôt want to let go, because for the first time you felt what it means to be happy. <br><br>  <b>Happy is the one who found a favorite thing.</b>  <b>A little less happy is he who does not understand that it is possible to earn a decent income without working 40 hours a week in unpleasant work.</b>  <b>Unhappy is the one who realized it too late.</b> <b><br></b> <br>  5 reasons why you will not become successful <br><br>  - you believe that the university will make you a professional; <br>  - you do not earn; <br>  - you do not develop, except for study; <br>  - you do not read books that show that you can live differently; <br>  - you do not trust the inner voice. <br><br>  I have compiled and collected popular mistakes of the youth.  I made many of them myself.  But I managed to get out of this, and that means you can succeed. <br><br>  Ask yourself: <br><br>  - where will I be in 5 years, continuing to do the same? <br>  - what would I regret if I died today? <br><br>  I wish I had written a book.  So I answered the second question over a year ago.  And I have success in this direction.  In recent months I have felt how precious time is, and I try not to waste it, especially in winter, when the city is less friendly and its temptations are hidden under a layer of snow. <br><br>  Young people burn the only thing they have - time.  This is the only resource that is 100% owned by people, and a great folly is to spend it on useless things. <br><br>  There is a law of energy in the world.  If you put a lot of effort into one activity, they will return to you the result.  This is not magic and not magic.  This is a convenient form that clarifies the simple truth leading to success. <br><br>  Conclusion <br><br>  Time is in your hands.  Take it as a resource.  Review the film "Time" and realize how valuable it is. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúYou can't always get what you want,</i> <i><br></i>  <i>But if you try one day, you'll find</i> <i><br></i>  <i>What do you get all you need "</i> <i><br></i> <br>  The Rolling Stones </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/298660/">https://habr.com/ru/post/298660/</a></p>
