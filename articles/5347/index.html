  <section class="page js-page"><h1>HD DVD will not give up Russia Blu-Ray</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Toshiba introduced the first serial HD DVD player in Russia.  Despite the fact that in the world the popularity of the new format is not as significant as the developers would like it to be, on the domestic market HD DVD has every chance to win the majority of the market.  At least in comparison with the competitor - the format of Blu-Ray. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The high-density HD DVD recording disc format was developed by Toshiba at the same time as the rival Blu-ray format, which was created by a consortium of companies led by Sony.  The main difference between HD DVD and Blu-ray is that technological and consumer properties of the content have no effect, and therefore it does not matter to watch high-definition film on discs and devices of one format or another for the viewer. <br><br>  However, there are a number of aspects that have a very serious impact when buying a new format player and disks to it.  For example, the price of an HD DVD device is currently $ 500 lower than Samsung's Blu-ray player, and the cost of the discs is half that.

      There are differences in the content of the formats.  The fact is that the leading Hollywood film companies and Blu-ray disc producers have already made statements that the Russian audience should not expect the first BD films before the fall of 2007.  Mass sales of films with the ‚ÄúRussian track‚Äù should be expected only by mid-2008.  In this sense, the HD DVD format for Russia is much more interesting, since already today the three leading Russian plants for replication (replication) of discs have already been purchased and have started production of discs of this format for the domestic Russian market.  Several Russian film companies also said they supported the format, and at the presentation a second Russian-language film in high-precision format, Graf Montenegro, was presented to journalists. <br><br>  Not the last factor in the popularity of HD DVD format for Russia can also be the fact that Toshiba supported the desire of some Chinese manufacturers of budget consumer electronics to start production of HD DVD players. <br><br>  Returning to the technical advantages of the format, it should be noted that, unlike Blu-ray HD, DVDs are more mechanically protected and less afraid of dust and scratches.  They can also be not only multi-layered, but also multi-format, when, for example, on a disc, in addition to two layers of HD DVD, there may still be two layers of a standard DVD.  This will allow users to smoothly move to the new standard.  Theoretically, Blu-ray is able to overtake HD DVD in terms of the volume of each layer (25 GB in BD versus 15 GB in HD DVD), as well as in the number of layers (6 vs. 3), but, on the one hand, the volume over 30 GB is already excessive for HD movies, on the other hand, HD DVD, unlike its competitor, allows you to make discs double-sided, which doubles its size. <br><br>  As a result, sales will show the viability of a particular format, only it seems that both of them will have equal circulation, but will divide the territory.  So, today it is already clear that Blu-ray format wins in the USA (its sales exceed 60% of HD content), and in Europe HD DVD format already has over 85% of sales at the beginning of spring 2007.  Russia also has great chances to choose HD DVD and by virtue of the developer‚Äôs marketing strategy, and by virtue of our Russian mentality. <br><br>  Based on <a href="http://www.cnews.ru/">CNews</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/5347/">https://habr.com/ru/post/5347/</a></p>
