  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Tabrier - collective video greetings</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>Life is decorated with holidays and important dates.</i>  <i>Quite often, you have to look for gifts and invent birthday greetings, wedding anniversaries or other events.</i>  <i>Often there is no opportunity to congratulate personally, and the idea to call seems to be insufficient.</i>  <i>Life spreads us around the world.</i>  <i>And sometimes you want to please colleagues, friends or close people with something really impressive!</i> <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/01b/bda/2ad/01bbda2adedb48eca6c1d18ffcd222f6.png" width="800"></div><br><br><h3>  Start </h3><br>  It all started about a year and a half ago, when I had to move to another country for work.  And very soon my mother's birthday, in which we always gathered in a large circle of family.  Many relatives have long gone over the world, but also my brother had to leave.  And so we decided that everyone would record their video greetings, we will beautifully assemble all this and on the Birthday we will present as a gift from everyone who was not there. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Not finding a suitable tool for this task, we asked everyone to send their videos for further mounting.  This is where the fun began, the videos were sent by e-mail, Viber, Telegram, YouTube and even had to record a video conversation on Skype.  The thing is that people sent in their usual way; many simply did not know how to record a video or send it by e-mail. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

      Do not convey all the events through which I had to go to collect all the videos in one place.  Everyone had to call or write, talk about the idea, explain how to write and send.  Then everything is not so simple either, it was necessary to convert, pick up music, come up with a script, combine, cut out the excess, sign each video. <br><br><h3>  Idea and development </h3><br>  The idea to create a service did not come immediately, she sat down deep in her head and sat there before the beginning of this year.  I didn‚Äôt have a mobile development experience, but there was a good developer background on the web.  There was a temptation to distribute a prototype on the <a href="http://phonegap.com/">PhoneGap</a> or <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">Ionic framework</a> , because the threshold for entering them is much lower, cross-platform, and the technology stack is already familiar.  But the idea disappeared in the first build of the sample, which showed not very high performance on simple tabs with no data.  Then I firmly decided to make a native Android application, test the hypothesis and demand, and then port to other mobile platforms. <br><br>  The first version was ready in about three months.  Further, there were long work on design, refinement of functional details and testing.  To which the bulk of the time has gone. <br><br>  A lot of time was spent on navigation, the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/213097/">article</a> on the habre about Android application anti-navigation patterns helped a lot. <br><br><h3>  How it works? </h3><br>  When registering as an identifier and a link, it was decided to use a phone number, as it was done in WhatsApp, Viber, Telegram and some other messengers.  This immediately solves the problem of communication between users.  No need to search for anyone, add to friends, confirm requests, everything is in the contact list. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/334/ee9/54c/334ee954cac84fc49ea4e2db900f4e12.png" align="right" width="350"><br>  It all comes down to three steps: <br><ol><li>  Event creation </li><li>  Greetings Record </li><li>  Sending to the addressee </li></ol><br>  When creating an event, you need to specify the name, date, select the recipient and scope: <br><ul><li>  <b>Public event</b> - will be available to anyone with an addressee in the contact list.  Each of them will be able to record their video greeting; </li><li>  <b>Selected friends</b> - will be available only to those you select.  Each of them will be able to record their video greeting; </li><li>  <b>Individual</b> - will be available only to you.  Only you can record a video greeting; </li></ul><br><br>  Now that the event has been created, everyone to whom it will be available will receive a notification with the event and the opportunity to record their video announcements. <br>  On the day of the event, all greetings will automatically be mounted into a single video with music and the use of various video filters, transition effects, and will be sent to the addressee. <br>  If the addressee of the event does not have an application installed, an SMS will be sent with a link to the video. <br><br>  As it turned out during the development process, the addressee most often wants to be able to thank everyone for the congratulations, and the participants are waiting for the addressee's reaction.  For this was added the ability to record your response video with thanks.  The recipients of which will be all those who participated in the recording of video greetings. <br><br>  By default, the final video is available only to the addressee, because the video may contain personal greetings, but the addressee has the opportunity to open access to all participants, after which all participants will receive notifications and the opportunity to view the final video after entering the event. <br><br><h3>  Monetization and plans </h3><br>  Use of the service is free.  There are several ideas to monetize the project: internal purchases of various themes for the design of the final video, the choice of music, support for corporate clients. <br><br>  There are a lot of plans and ideas for development: test the android version, finish the iOS version, work on the design of the generated videos, the ability to record greetings from the site, the separation of a standard set of events based on the user's country. <br><br><h3>  Conclusion </h3><br>  During testing, we did not miss the opportunity to congratulate people on the real events of their lives; these were relatives, friends, and even complete strangers who through acquaintances learned about the service being developed.  The result exceeded all expectations, absolutely everyone could not hold back tears of joy. <br><br>  If it is interesting, I will write a separate post about the server part and work with video. <br><br>  Thank you very much, I would like to tell Microsoft for their <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/">BizSpark</a> program, a very significant help for beginner projects. <br><br>  Thanks to everyone who read it.  I will try to answer questions in the comments, who do not have such an opportunity, can feel free to write to <a href="">support@tabrier.com</a> <br><br>  <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.tabrier">Link to the app in Google Play</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265069/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265069/</a></p>
