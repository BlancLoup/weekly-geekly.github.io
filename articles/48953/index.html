      Yes, indeed, if we are talking about online testing, then a group of students are driven into the computer room, they open the website of the Federal Internet Exam and issue logins and passwords for access to the exam. <br><br>  After that, it is assumed that the student is not taking notes and textbooks on his own and passes this test. <br><br>  But the very idea of ‚Äã‚Äãan online exam was not approved by the teachers, at least in my university.  As a result, faculty members look at the fact that students use third-party materials. <br><br>  Also FEPO is used to check the residual knowledge of students.  Those.  A third-year student may be given a test in a subject that he took as a freshman. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  How does this go? </h4><br><br>  After logging in to the page with the exam, the following window opens before the student: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/718/a27/28d/718a2728d58f733087be574e75a4459e.jpg"><br>  <a href="">picture on alternative hosting, from the habr effect</a> <br><br>  A question, answer options and a ticking timer. <br>  The test treats students rather sparingly - allows you to skip questions to return to them later.  Even if you answered the question, there is an opportunity to return to it and choose a new answer. <br>  Tasks include not only the questions where you need to choose the answer options, but also where you need to type the answer on the keyboard. <br><br><h4>  This bug we have feature called </h4><br><br>  It looks quite rosy, but there are not rare cases when there are two <b>identical</b> answers for a question. <br>  And only one is true, the result is a lottery. <br>  Or it is possible that the <i>correct</i> answer to a question that must be entered manually contains <br>  grammatical mistake or typo. <br>  Those.  for example the question: <i>What is a ROM?</i> <br>  The correct answer would not be <i>Permanently Memory</i> , but <i>Permanently Memorizing device</i> . <br><br>  It is also assumed that the student should not be able to launch a second browser window and open Google or Wikipedia in it.  By the way, it is, but smart students have learned to circumvent this prohibition. <br>  The window with Google and Wikipedia opens <i>before</i> the exam, i.e.  until you are logged in to the Federal Internet Exam Site. <br><br>  In the test is possible from 24 to 32 questions.  Time is given from 45 minutes to 90 minutes.  It seems to be enough at first glance, but sometimes there are stalemate situations where there are several minutes left until the end of the test, and several questions take time to think, then the student can use the bug - try to bring up the context menu by right-clicking on the exam window .  This label will appear: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/50b/521/9ac/50b5219acf1e8cc981aac168200a8c27.jpg"><br>  <a href="">picture on alternative hosting, from the habr effect</a> <br><br>  And the timer at this point to stop. <br><br>  It is not uncommon for a test to close by itself and return a ‚Äúcritical error‚Äù. <br>  Or just in itself takes and finishes testing when half of questions are not answered. <br><br>  And here is the question I got myself when I passed this exam in the discipline "Informatics": <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bd3/24f/9b0/bd324f9b061f635bac9f8c86db01e536.jpg"><br>  <a href="">picture on alternative hosting, from the habr effect</a> <br>  Either a test of attention, or a programmer's mistake. <br><br><h4>  findings </h4><br><br>  Federal Internet Exam - already introduced in most universities, as an alternative to the usual.  As you can see, he is far from perfect.  There are too many critical points that affect the objective assessment of student knowledge. <br>  It is good that our teachers give you the opportunity to retake the exams in the usual format, if the test results did not satisfy you. <br>  On the other hand, troeshnik who have scored a decent amount of points by the ‚Äúspear‚Äù method have the opportunity to get a good grade without straining. <br>  All data from the exams are stored in a special register, apparently in the Min. Education, from where they are sent to the dean of your university. <br><br>  The idea itself pleases - finally, high technologies come into our ordinary life, exam time is reduced by several times, student knowledge is evaluated objectively, because communication does not occur with a teacher, but with a soulless machine that cannot be bribed. <br>  But the result is deplorable.  Students are not serious about this test, they blatantly use didactic materials, use the Internet and even the teacher‚Äôs help, with the result that students get high scores, which are worthy of being questioned, i.e.  objective evaluation does not occur. <br><br><h4>  PS </h4><br><br>  Project site - <a href="http://www.fepo.ru/">www.fepo.ru</a> <br>  Everyone has the opportunity to try themselves in this test <a href="http://www.fepo.ru/test_demo.php%3Ftype%3Dvuz">by clicking on this link.</a> <br><br><h4>  Pps </h4><br>  Your obedient servant, after passing the test scored 79%, as a result of which he went to take the exam according to the old, proven method. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/48953/">https://habr.com/ru/post/48953/</a></p>
