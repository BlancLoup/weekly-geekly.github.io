But the presence of the wire and the absence of pockets (especially in summer) at the top of my wardrobe was a bit annoying.  For a long time I couldn‚Äôt collect my courage and buy something wireless to listen to music and answer calls, but the constant inconvenience prevailed over laziness and I went to dealextreme.com in search of an inexpensive and high-quality stereo bluetooth headset. <br><br>  Frankly speaking, there was no abundance in this product segment.  I focused on finding those products that have customer reviews.  I had to choose between elegant <i><b>BH-505</b></i> , similar to them <i><b>S9-HD</b></i> and somewhat bulky <i><b>BH-503</b></i> .  Reading the reviews, I realized that either I would sacrifice the ease and elegance of the headset, or its consumer qualities.  Resigned to the fact that the dimensions and weight of the headset will be larger than I would like, I chose the <i><b>BH-503</b></i> .  Having paid for the purchase with a paper, all I got was 784 rubles, and I waited for the cherished package.  This is not my first order on dilextreme, and I must say, this time the package arrived quite quickly - in just 3 weeks.

      About the headset itself and my impressions after a month of operation and the story goes.  As usual, a dozen pictures. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  WHAT'S INSIDE </h4><br>  I apologize in advance for the quality of the photos - there are no conditions for setting good lighting, and my camera is rather old. <br><br>  At the post office, after performing the usual ritual, I was given a small and not very heavy package. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/10d7313e/404a357c/8433c820/531dfa7e.jpg"><br><br>  I removed a pretty crumpled, but still made from a package box of 175x185x70 mm in size.  Printing and quality cardboard at the height. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/dc5f959e/17827d7a/ac0260dd/a152c18c.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to the box, caring Chinese hands placed a $ 5 discount coupon in the package.  Trifle, but nice!  eight) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/d54ed292/098d6243/aa3b79a8/6138e0ea.jpg"><br><br>  Out of the box, I extracted a thin manual in English (well, not in Chinese, although on request in Google I immediately found a link to the same <a href="http://nds1.nokia.com/phones/files/main_page/Nokia_BH-503_UG_ru.pdf">manul</a> in PDF format in Russian) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/cd81d21f/6270e374/06eea160/c8954561.jpg"><br><br>  and the ‚Äúcrib‚Äù in which the headphones and charger were located.  Headset cushions were covered with bags of polyethylene foam. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/667eeb3a/69016b64/c3f0e980/4eee4e79.jpg"><br><br>  The charger, as expected, turned out to be with a US-Chinese plug, but that did not bother me.  On the same day I purchased an adapter for 60 rubles and the problem was solved.  I was pleased with the presence of the "tail" with "Velcro" for easy fastening of the coiled wire.  The question is a penny, but how uncomfortable when this little thing is not! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/b960effb/a1e143c4/15adf5b5/f3382a61.jpg"><br><br>  The charger looks just great.  I suspect that those charges that are put into the boxes of original NOKIA devices have come down from the same conveyor as this one.  The presence of the ‚ÄúPCT‚Äù badge on the device was also surprising. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/9eaf8b68/9381a365/92b69135/1ded0eef.jpg"><br><br><h4>  QUALITY MATERIALS AND EXECUTIONS </h4><br>  Immediately make a reservation: I have never seen and did not hold the original BH-503 in my hands, so I have nothing to compare with.  I just tell you about my impressions and feelings. <br><br>  For a device costing $ 25 headphones look just great.  The only thing that caught my eye during the first inspection was the presence of a small flare in some places on the rim.  The headband is molded from plastic, and the outer part is covered with rubber.  But if you do not find fault looks bezel quite bearable. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/c7e1e77a/3328e440/21149b31/7ed3738b.jpg"><br><br>  By the rim with the help of rivets, the handles are attached, to which the loudspeakers are attached with the help of two miniature screws, screwed from the inside.  I could not find any backlash or creaking in the joints of the parts.  Everything is done soundly.  Plastic to the touch quality, rubber, too (at least leaves no residue and does not get dirty). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/3909bb23/230ea865/c2b4eb7a/ef97ef59.jpg"><br><br>  The speaker cases are made of glossy black plastic with red metallic red metallic spacers.  parts are tightly connected, there is no distortion anywhere, gaps.  Everything is very high quality.  All controls, as well as a microphone and a miniature hole for connecting the charger, are concentrated in the right earpiece.  The battery, apparently, is divided into two parts, each of which is in its earpiece. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/a70f2fe9/51577c75/18dad31c/d5e88b4c.jpg"><br><br>  It makes no sense to describe in detail the design and functionality, the reviews of the original BH-503 are full on Runet, who are interested in the details - can read at least <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/accessories/review/nokia-bh503.shtml">this one</a> . <br><br>  In general, I am satisfied with the quality of manufacturing the headset.  And my friends, when they saw my new clothes, even took her for the original device from NOKIA. <br><br><h4>  QUALITY WORK AND ERGONOMICS </h4><br>  After a month of active use of the headset, I can say: it is worth the money I paid for it.  I would pay for it and more.  Headphones are very comfortable to sit on your head.  No discomfort during prolonged wear does not occur.  They do not put pressure on their ears and, in spite of their rather rather big weight (about 100 grams), it does not feel like something heavy and alien.  They sit very well and do not fall down.  Shaking them off is rather difficult. <br><br><h5>  Ergonomics </h5><br>  The ‚Äúplay / pause‚Äù, ‚Äúcall‚Äù, ‚Äúforward‚Äù and ‚Äúback‚Äù buttons are pressed quite easily, there is no problem with that.  The sound signals from the headphones when turning on, turning off and establishing communication with the sound source, allow all manipulations with them without removing from the head.  But in order to increase / decrease the volume, you have to lean against the bottom edge with your thumb, and with the middle or index finger press the rather rigid volume ‚Äúrocker‚Äù buttons located on the upper edge of the earpiece. <br><br><h5>  Sound </h5><br>  The headset supports the following Bluetooth 2.0 profiles with EDR: <br><ul><li>  Headset Profile (HSP); </li><li>  Handsfree Profile (HFP); </li><li>  Advanced Audio Distribution Profile (A2DP); </li><li>  Audio Video Remote Control Profile (AVRCP). </li></ul><br>  Connection is very simple, no problem.  Turn on the headset, go to the Bluetooth settings, look for the device and ‚Äúfloat‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/6af4a363/2d687457/17c93422/da30dafb.png"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage1/356c3385/eab3d7ae/4e9c8bb2/3bf0dd38.png"><br><br>  I used a headset with only two smartphones on Androyd: just a short time with the Samsung Galaxy S (firmware 2.3.3 unofficial) and the last 4 weeks with the Samsung SGH-I897 Captivate.  In addition, I tried it with a netbook, on which Ubuntu 11.04 is installed. <br><br>  The first connection was to the Samsung Galaxy S. I must say that I practically do not use Androyd‚Äôs regular player.  My favorite music app is PowerAMP.  He has excellent sound processing and a great equalizer.  By plugging in the headphones and starting playback, I immediately realized that I would have to make a separate equalizer profile for the headset.  I was literally crushed by the bass!  Having spent 10 minutes on tuning and saving the profile, I began to drive various compositions - from hard rock to classical music.  The sound of a new toy literally fascinated me.  I put my favorite album and went for a walk, putting the smart in a pocket of shorts.  And here came a drop of tar: when walking, the sound sometimes disappeared for a split second, the device lost contact with the sound source.  Periodically, the frequency of these breaks began to annoy.  I'm a little upset.  When I got home, I started to google about these symptoms and soon found information that both the original BH-503 and other wireless headsets suffer from this.  One person even noticed that the frequency of such troubles depends on the firmware of the phone. <br><br>  And I was convinced that this is so.  When I changed my old Samsung Galaxy S to ‚ÄúKaptiva‚Äù, the breaks in the connection became so rare that I stopped this upset.  Maximum 1-2 times per day.  In the apartment, the connection between the ears and the telephone is held almost everywhere, if it is left somewhere in the center.  in the line of sight, the distance may exceed 10 meters. <br><br>  With a netbook, I managed to pair a headset and even listen to music - the sound is excellent, but!  I do not know what the reason is, but the output to the headset now and then strived to jump on the laptop speakers.  Having suffered a bit, I left this venture, because I got used to using ‚Äúplugs‚Äù to watch movies and TV shows in the prone position, and in the supine position I will not allow this headset to use the bezel. <br><br>  Noise isolation, by virtue of the design, leaves much to be desired.  Listening to music in a transport or in a noisy place is not very comfortable.  In addition, the sound is heard in part and the surrounding.  True for me, these little things do not matter.  On the contrary, I often ride a bike and listen to music to better hear the environment, so as not to be crushed crept behind the car.  eight) <br><br><h4>  Autonomy and speed of charge </h4><br>  The manufacturer claims up to 13 hours of talk time or music playback and up to 200 hours of standby time.  Check the last figure is quite difficult, but there is little interesting.  But from the first I probably agree.  I use the headset every day for about 2 hours to listen to music at ‚âà 70% of maximum volume.  Sometimes, 3-4 times a day, during the listening process, I answer calls or call myself.  I speak for 1-2 minutes.  With all this full charge I have enough for a week. <br><br>  But with the case charge is slightly different from the word printed.  The manual states that the full charge time is less than 3 hours.  I didn‚Äôt manage to fully charge the battery in less than 5 hours.  I couldn't even wait for the first charge, I fell asleep, obviously more than 6 hours. <br><br><h4>  CONCLUSION </h4><br>  So, what do we have in the "dry residue"?  The device is not without flaws, but by and large the price / quality ratio outweighs all the disadvantages.  For an unpretentious person, it will save a decent amount and will please with sound quality for many years. <br><br>  Pros: <br><ul><li>  low obscene price; </li><li>  high quality materials and workmanship; </li><li>  wearing comfort, no discomfort; </li><li>  long battery life; </li><li>  high-quality sound, rich, rich bass; </li><li>  excellent hearing when talking - the microphone is at a height; </li><li>  no interruption of playback when sound alerts on the phone; </li></ul><br><br>  Minuses: <br><ul><li>  from time to time it loses contact with the phone for a short time; with some devices the frequency of ‚Äúbreaks‚Äù can be high; </li><li>  there is no possibility of rewinding on the track; </li><li>  The ring tone is not transmitted to the headphones. </li></ul><br>  I did not specifically mention the lack of sound insulation as a disadvantage.  For this there are other types of headsets.  And in some cases it can be regarded as a virtue.  For example, when riding a bike, you can listen to music without risking not hearing a car pulling around. <br><br>  Thanks for attention!  I hope the information will be useful. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/124373/">https://habr.com/ru/post/124373/</a></p>
