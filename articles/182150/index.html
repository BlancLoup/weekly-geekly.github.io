And this news is such that from her hair should stand on end on her head! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/fbf/bed/6c0/fbfbed6c02f086e58890cffa5b9c3c13.png" align="right">  <a href="http://www.osfsb.ru/">The Public Council under the Federal Security Service of Russia</a> (I present its logo on the right) considered it necessary (probably at a meeting <nobr><a href="http://www.osfsb.ru/press-center/news/279/default.aspx">on May 29</a> ) to</nobr> propose to the State Duma such amendments to the Law ‚ÄúOn Information, Information Technologies and Information Protection‚Äù, which would make <b>all</b> programs masking information data illegal <nobr>and IP addresses of</nobr> users.  This also applies to the <b>Tor</b> browser, and anonymizing sites that allow using a normal browser to go from a modified <nobr>IP address</nobr> to some other site (blocked <nobr>for ‚Äúextremism‚Äù,</nobr> <nobr>for ‚Äú</nobr> suicide <nobr>propaganda</nobr> ‚Äù, <nobr>for ‚Äú</nobr> drug <nobr>propaganda</nobr> ‚Äù, <nobr>for ‚Äúpedophilia‚Äù)</nobr> and read this site nevertheless (perhaps secretly sarcastic chuckling at Roskomnadzor - who knows? ...).  Now it will be no laughing matter. <br><br>  Interesting are the replies of individuals given by Izvestia in connection with this initiative.

      Anatoly G. Kucherena (a member of the Public Council under the FSB, who became <a href="http://www.cikrf.ru/law/decree_of_cec/2012/02/06/Zp12767.html">Putin‚Äôs proxy</a> in the 2012 elections) told Izvestia directly that they are preparing recommendations for deputies to introduce responsibility for creating software that allows them to visit banned websites.  ‚ÄúAdopt a clear law, which will spell out sanctions that can keep programmers from wanting to create malicious software <nobr>products,‚Äù</nobr> Kucherin said the intentions of the fighters with network anonymity. <br><br>  The opinion of Leonid Leonidovich Levin (the first deputy committee of the State Duma on information policy) is that anonymizers are used by people who intend to perform <nobr>some kind of</nobr> illegal actions, or by those who have something to hide. <br><br>  The site ‚ÄúSputnik and Pogrom‚Äù adds that after Tor and anonymizers, the fight against VPN will inevitably begin - and I think this opinion is quite fair, even with an increase: not only VPN, but also SSH, and after them HTTPS, probably SSL in whole <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b6d/d2c/cfa/b6dd2ccfad18578c8f0d06bf8a28de2c.png" align="right">  What happens if this struggle with anonymity and secrecy is a complete success? <br><br>  It seems that the physical destruction of the remnants of network privacy will come - and they will establish such a totalitarianism that Orwell didn‚Äôt see: <nobr>Orwell</nobr> only has telecranes, <nobr>and we have</nobr> computers, computers! <br><br>  And it is sad to see that the establishment of this totalitarianism is carried out under the slogan of resisting "extremism", "child pornography", "drugs" <nobr>and "suicide";</nobr>  I am not in vain taking these terms in quotes, because their use in current law enforcement practice is largely arbitrary.  We read about how the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158367/">site about the game EVE Online</a> (which described the use of fictional chemicals to fictional characters) was <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/158367/">closed</a> <nobr>for ‚Äúdrugs‚Äù</nobr> , and <nobr>for ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù -</nobr> innocuous humor like an <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175205/">article from Absurdopedia</a> or <a href="http://lleo.me/dnevnik/2013/03/18.html">Kaganov‚Äôs works</a> (and in the so-called real world under the pretext of child suicide, the death note manga in the Sverdlovsk region is <a href="http://www.e1.ru/news/spool/news_id-385971.html">withdrawn from sale</a> , although the whole region is named after one of the organizers of the Emperor‚Äôs children‚Äôs murder, but nobody cares about it, <nobr>for ‚Äúextremism‚Äù -</nobr> nationally targeted anti-alk  home propaganda (‚Ññ1568 in the Federal <a href="http://minjust.ru/ru/extremist-materials">List of Extremist Materials</a> ) or calls to the authorities for accountability to voters (‚Ññ292 ibid.).  As for ‚Äúchild pornography‚Äù (actually intended for fully adult pedophiles), the need to combat its <i>consumption</i> on the Internet (instead of fighting its <i>production</i> in the real world, inevitably associated with the actual corruption of real children, for whom unlicensed anonymous distributions on the Internet they are a direct economic threat, they are deprived of financing) is not quite obvious - <nobr>and the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/147653/">question</a></nobr> asked about this to the minister turned out to be ignored. <br><br>  About a month ago (more precisely, on May 6, 2013) in the blog ‚Äú <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/178773/">Black <nobr>List 2.0,</nobr> now with criminal penalties,</a> ‚Äù I also argued that the bogey of ‚Äúsuicide‚Äù <nobr>and ‚Äúchild</nobr> pornography‚Äù could (and is starting) to be used to combat the spread of modern Japanese culture, that is, with the proliferation of anime, manga, ranobe and visual novels: in many of these works, it is not difficult to find erotic or tanatical motifs (partly reminiscent of William Shakespeare with his character Juliet, who at the age of thirteen managed and loved  s Romeo and be done with them), it is easy to find children in situations of non-children. <br><br>  Anime fans (up to one-third of Habrahabr participants will be picked up <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/150007/">by the poll results</a> ) will be saddened by the news that in just the month that has passed since then, there has been a serious preparation of public opinion on this matter. <br><br>  Not only in New Zealand (as mentioned <nobr><a href="http://russian.rt.com/article/7857">on the RT website</a> ),</nobr> but also in Russia an <a href="http://mir24.tv/news/society/7118050">expert opinion is being prepared</a> on attributing erotic animations to the category of ‚Äúchild pornography‚Äù. <br><br>  A group appeared in the social network "VKontakte", called "Anime vs. Veterans".  Members of this group who consider themselves anime lovers (or just playing the role of anime artists) used anime attributes and anime slang for grossly insulting the veterans of World War II and the heroic accomplishments of the Soviet people.  Currently, the group is <a href="http://vk.com/anime_vs_veteran">closed by the administration of the</a> site ‚ÄúVKontakte‚Äù, however, not earlier than it was noticed on May 9 and caused widespread fair indignation.  Ulyana Skoybeda (this is the same journalist who recently <a href="http://communitarian.ru/novosti/v-rossii/ura_antisemitov_poymali_liberasty_reshili_zatravit_ulyanu_skoybedu_i_ee_rodstvennikov_22052013/">became famous</a> thanks to a speech in defense of the Soviet winning army, accompanied by sarcastic attacks on her critics ‚Äî liberals of Jewish racial origin) could not pass by this group of anime anti-Soviets and branded them in the article ‚Äú <a href="http://www.kp.ru/daily/26073/2979809/">Pobedy Day <nobr>and gay orgievskaya</nobr> ribbon</a> ", laid out on May 9 on the website of Komsomolskaya Pravda." <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">This article was also published in the print version of Komsomolskaya Pravda.</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/12e/7bb/f71/12e7bbf71254babdab2fdcf7963aad03.jpg" alt="[newspaper photo]"></div></div><br>  In my mind, the call ‚Äúforget the name of the insane Herostratus!‚Äù And the term ‚ÄúStreisand effect‚Äù at the sight of this struggle, which looks more like PR, albeit black. <br><br>  It should also be noted that such a group on the VKontakte site is not alone.  There is, for example, ‚Äú <a href="http://vk.com/anime_better_than_allah">Anime is better than Allah</a> ‚Äù, created later on the same principle (unless it is aimed not at veterans, but at Muslims) and also having time to get its share of PR, in particular, <a href="http://demotivation.me/er31jgecotzzpic.html">at the demotivator</a> . <br><br>  Watching all this with animosity, it is difficult to get rid of the idea that such social work is carefully coordinated by outsiders - perhaps even by the special services.  It reminds, you know, a bearded anecdote that the fight against extremism has reached such a scale that there are several extremist groups that consist <b>entirely</b> of embedded FSB agents.  Involuntarily it begins to seem that these two groups <nobr>on VKontakte</nobr> consist entirely of FSB agents (of the so-called ‚Äúagents of influence‚Äù, at least), and the whole purpose of their existence is only to be able to the moment to present them to society as an excuse to point at animeshnikov, <nobr>exclaim ‚Äúatu!‚Äù,</nobr> start persecution.  And under the guise of doing away with anonymity on the Internet. <br><br>  Well, in conclusion - for unloading the mind - scattered fragments of poetry and manga, in a vivid, figurative form, reinforcing the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe text you read.  To memorize memetic. <br><br>  I swear I'll be cleaner and kinder <br>  And in trouble I will never leave a friend. <br>  I do not want a regime like in North Korea - <br>  Let them come to their senses, not the whole ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà! <br><br>  Beautiful Madoka, do not be cruel to me ... <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">Fragment of the manta Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko</b> <div class="spoiler_text"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/d64/fd0/c62/d64fd0c62b34d737f317abdbdcaa8090.png" alt="[fragment of manta Hentai Ouji to Warawanai Neko]"></div></div></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/182150/">https://habr.com/ru/post/182150/</a></p>
