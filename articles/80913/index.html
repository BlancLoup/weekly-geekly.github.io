In the first part, I talked about the equipment, appearance, and structural features ... and even made a short <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DnPPpWz66TUo">video</a> demonstrating the "endurance" of the screen. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d7a/106/339/d7a106339e654f0cb2c7302a814c78dd.jpg" alt="image"><br>  But‚Ä¶ <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  ... but do not think that I broke the screen)) huh.  It‚Äôs just that the little detailed description of the tasty filling was simply lacking strength at that time, and I didn‚Äôt want to inflate the post) So, as I promised, the final part ... everything is just as small, but I tried to include not everything, but only the most interesting . <a href="http://twitter.com/Boomburum"><img src="http://bit.ly/7OBiOy" alt=":)"></a> <br><br>  As I said, the novelty is built on the <b>Qualcomm QSD8250</b> platform, the heart of which is a <b>Snapdragon processor</b> with a clock frequency of 1GHz.  Despite the fact that Qualcomm has already developed stones with a frequency of 1.3 and 1.5 GHz, they will appear in the devices not earlier than 2011, so that at least until the end of the year HTC HD2 will hold on to its flagship.  There will be, of course, models with a gigahertz (on the android), but they will have a smaller screen diagonal - 3.7 and 3.8 inches. <br><br>  Here - Windows Mobile 6.5, it‚Äôs also Windows Mobile Phone.  I will not describe all the changes, but at least it is worth noting the widespread finger optimization.  The device turns on and comes into operation in exactly 20 seconds, another 10 seconds is required to load the <b>HTC Sense</b> shell, which can be turned off if desired.  HTC Sense is the same <b>HTC TouchFlo (3D)</b> , but with some improvements and improvements.  Let's dwell on it in more detail.

      A small retreat.  Let me remind you that the screen diagonal is 4.3 inches (88x56 mm), and the resolution is 480x800.  Oddly enough, the picture fits perfectly in these dimensions - without any hint of pixels.  Here is a screenshot of the screen in full size (this picture fits in 4.3 ''): <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/012/6ca/612/0126ca6123ae288a6b56f804609cbff5.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Impressive?  :) And me.  That is why all the screenshots below will be reduced by 50%. <br><br><h2>  HTC Sense </h2><br>  Immediately after loading the device, a ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù appears in front of the user - a large clock, weather data, a calendar and, if necessary, contacts or shortcuts to applications appear on top. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b4b/05e/849/b4b05e84954ed33c6719ae4f19bf01c3.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/06e/542/5b1/06e5425b17c98e19d0c02a23c537daf7.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Below - the bar on which the icons are located - making a horizontal movement with your finger on them (or just a horizontal stroke), you can switch to other windows with other functions.  Initially, there are about 10 tabs available - contacts, sms, mail, twitter, calendar, weather, photos, music, stocks, footprints, music and something else ... but I immediately turned off the excess (in particular, stocks and other footprints) - without them it is easier to find the required + smaller load (although there are no brakes even at the ‚Äúmaximum‚Äù). <br><br>  <b>Home</b>  Depending on the weather in your city, this or that animation is displayed on the main ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù - frost, snow, rain, sun, wind and so on - you can watch the demo through the menu.  Beautiful and very functional.  On the same page, you can make a "stroke" down - in this case, the 3x3 matrix will open, into which you can put contacts, bookmarks or applications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/237/92f/85f/23792f85fb633ff68084b44cc2a3f44f.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ee4/e19/bbb/ee4e19bbbcf2be454196e5278c4e9e56.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Contacts</b>  The entire address book is very convenient.  Removed, because  about the same can be met by pressing the "green" button.  There will be time - I will put a dialer from <b><a href="http://www.inesoft.com/rus/index.php%3Fin%3Dphone.html">IneSoft</a></b> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/04c/a90/a34/04ca90a342f8baa0846cbccfcc56e4e8.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3cf/75d/924/3cf75d924e81f4bfc897c318396bccca.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Messages</b>  Actually, sms-ki) This is beautiful, more accurate, more beautiful than the standard WM-message window (which, by the way, can be found) - one message is displayed on the screen (there can be no more than 25 of them all), flipping between them is done by moving your finger up or down.  Clicking on any of them opens the whole history of correspondence with the contact.  Well, clicking on "all messages" opens a standard message box - incoming, sent, deleted, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/28f/805/5fc/28f8055fc7c67ac04a3a567c93ae1cb6.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3cd/ee9/c96/3cdee9c96d58a7c2a8b030efb9dfcb44.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/505/102/761/50510276178bd0f06f64baa18eee8de8.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Mail</b> .  You can add multiple mailboxes - I added two.  By clicking Deliver Mail, incoming emails appear on the screen in a stack of sheets.  Unfortunately, recently removed this function, because  the browser homepage is installed m.yandex.ru, where I have everything I need.  The rest may well come in handy. <br><br>  <b>Twitter</b>  The device has a great Twitter client called <b>HTC Peep</b> .  Perhaps something better and hard to come up with!  It works quickly and allows you to solve the whole range of TWI tasks - read others, follow, retweet, write yourself, post pictures, etc. - everything is intuitively clear and works like a clock. <br>  In the system settings, you can configure the update Twitter - for example, every 30 minutes to deliver all new messages.  Disable this feature because  Gprs-traffic is not government-owned (and wi-fi is not always), and more often I read on a computer.  But when you need to - you can update and pass the time) VERY happy! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ce8/969/1bb/ce89691bbc4c5bcfd550cc3e40a84998.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/fcb/f1d/b41/fcbf1db41870d1f9543781df70063a93.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Photos</b>  Initially, the device recorded several beautiful images, the weight of each of which is approximately megabytes.  On the photo viewing tab, they turn over like a five-kilo byte thumbnail.  Everything is smooth, if desired, you can bring two fingers.  When you change the orientation to the landscape, all frames are rotated and they can scroll through an order of magnitude faster. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d67/5d0/710/d675d0710d030fcb1854f69c5e6515ff.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/14e/62f/24c/14e62f24cc6dad200cc36fadfdd1fb1c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Weather</b>  All the same beautiful clouds and snowflakes, only for a couple of days ahead and, if desired, for different cities.  Apparently, just slowly eats traffic. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6c3/1ac/58a/6c31ac58adf130783f057cce0547dabe.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a46/c43/bd4/a46c43bd413296ac175bfdf9dd516540.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/387/5fd/33a/3875fd33aa820df6b37972a636c5c34a.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b33/318/a10/b33318a10b11687ade140effb23e2581.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/af8/177/aa4/af8177aa43f33efee4578d33ff49185b.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/629/138/70a/62913870a0d9203b23fbf7839c201c98.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Settings</b> .  Actually, the last tab is one of the most useful) All settings are divided into several groups and it is easy to find the right one.  But if such an appearance does not suit (although it is he who is ‚Äúimprisoned‚Äù under the fingers), you can always return to the appearance of the WM settings. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6c3/b9a/531/6c3b9a53118e7ef16be10a61efd3b41b.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ac1/8f8/54d/ac18f854d9b0424d430008a57a741038.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/5c4/bb2/82d/5c4bb282d03cd8c50f4c6416f797141e.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/56e/5d0/769/56e5d0769c68450a479bbaec872d82f5.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/cff/c1f/a87/cffc1fa87d64991fa621a443a0150a07.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7a4/966/66f/7a496666f6e0f0de49b8a9225cf84a92.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f32/f78/777/f32f78777ab7d9dc355386e1f25f4aa7.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/7d9/d7b/37d/7d9d7b37deae9249dd8cd04cc789fffe.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bf9/98e/711/bf998e71150e99598d162efb13234255.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a3c/41f/dc5/a3c41fdc53237da169b2920b62140ed4.png" alt="image"><br><br>  If desired, HTC Sense can be turned off and the user‚Äôs interface will appear in front of the user for a couple of years. But I found the strength to give up all this ( <b>SPB Mobile shell</b> , <b>Pocket Suite,</b> and other convenience-beauty) in favor of the manila - you can fully use the device directly from boxes.  The only thing I lack now is the <b>dciBalance</b> program <b>lines</b> on the first screen of the HTC Sense interface. <br><br>  When the device is locked, a lock button appears on the screen, which needs to be moved like on an iPhone.  But, unlike the latter, you can move in any direction that the owners of short fingers will appreciate))) <br><br>  Someone HD2, fell without a cover on the tile: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/76a/e59/adb/76ae59adb659a5ce354fd2ba89a827a2.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Keyboard </h2><br>  Special attention is given to the keyboard, which is installed on the communicator.  Externally, it has much in common with the iPhone, but the layouts are different.  In portrait orientation, these are 6 rows of buttons (the bottom row consists of 4 buttons, they are arrows) - this is done so that all the numbers and a huge number of characters are available.  The last two categories of characters are typed by holding the fingertip on the buttons and a small gesture up on the pop-up tooltip.  This was in the same <b>Resco Keyboard</b> , which turned out to be more than convenient ... but it doesn‚Äôt have strokes, so quickly typing ‚Äú:)))‚Äù will not work - you will have to spend a second on each bracket. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0dc/6d9/96d/0dc6d996d8c8db35854e99e39f32501a.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/026/2cb/662/0262cb6628f650216a3af7f717a21798.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There is a built-in error correction and some analogue of the T9 (called the XT9), but I immediately removed these enhancements - without them, it is printed just as good.  The English layout has 5 rows of buttons.  In addition to them, there are two more pages of characters - also in 5 rows. <br>  When you rotate the device in landscape orientation, the keyboard stretches across the entire side and, best of all, there is a space on the screen for the text :) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/10c/c77/351/10cc773516857db3ac02943e16e5d810.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is convenient to print - the buttons are quite large and you can get on them with even the largest fingers.  But personally, I had to retrain a little to type on a capacitive screen after a resistive screen - VERY unusual, at first I missed very often. <br>  In general, the keyboard is nice and comfortable, but I miss the strokes in Resco.  It will be necessary to put it somehow - I hope it will work.  In the meantime, all the programs that I tried to install got up.  But, they say, some softinks still refuse to work - apparently those that are strongly tied to the subtleties of a certain version of WM. <br><br><h2>  the Internet </h2><br>  Initially, Internet Explorer and Opera Mobile (9.7) browsers are installed on the device - the first one didn‚Äôt even try, and I use the second one all the time.  Opera supports multitouch, which is very convenient when viewing sites.  I tried to put the latest beta from Opera Mobile 10 - a very beautiful and functional thing, but the multitouch in it did not go ( <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/3aa/189/2d3/3aa1892d399ff77ac014e3512b7cbcf9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Sites load very quickly and very efficiently - to some extent, you can even work with them.  But the most pleasant thing about all this is the screen size;) <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DQmDmH8lEQJE">Vidic</a> about browsers. <br><br>  As an IM client, I chose <b>Pigeon</b> , in passing putting a new version, which recently came out.  Perfectly stretches under the whole screen - it is a pleasure to communicate! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/08c/876/1e2/08c8761e224efe64b717f1bc2fa476a5.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c2a/a5c/fd8/c2aa5cfd8f3dc24d43eff906d5878762.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Audio </h2><br>  As I said, the sound of the speaker is loud, but for listening to music ... although no, it is quite suitable.  But this sound will be worse than the sound from the same netbook ... so it's better to use headphones, and use the speaker for calls.  Under this case can be useful built-in editor ringtones for trimming files. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ad/7ea/44f/6ad7ea44fd6e7a9182bcde0b1c409d3c.png" alt="image"><br><br>  I did not try to use the headset from the kit, but the <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/67534/">Razer Moray +</a></b> frost-resistant plugs <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/67534/">+</a></b> normal flight.  Thanks to the headphones, there is a radio that is not implemented in the best way - in the same <b><a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/hardware/72322/">Cowon S9 a</a></b> much more sophisticated shell.  As for the built-in player - such a beautiful player) Three buttons for music control, timeline, time + title and large cover. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/58f/e30/9c4/58fe309c459d46cd0df929cffeaed955.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Going to the library, you can see all the songs, sort by artist, genre, album, create a playlist.  If you rotate the device in a horizontal position, the carpets from the albums line up in a slender row and allow you to slide your finger smoothly back and forth.  It seems that somewhere like we have already seen) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/49b/510/9e7/49b5109e7ce1845254c0cdd950e6aeae.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Otherwise, while using the P3300, I got used to the <b><a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D8256">Pocket Player</a></b> . <br>  As for the sound quality, it is at a high level - loud and expressive.  In player mode, the phone works for about 12-13 hours. <br><br><h2>  Video </h2><br>  Immediately after buying the phone, I bought an 8GB card inside - mainly for programs, a small amount of music + photo-video from the camera.  That was.  But later, as it turned out, the device is not very much off to eat videos, even unconverted.  For example, movies weighing up to 2GB are easily played - with good quality and without the slightest hint of brakes.  True, only through third-party players such as <b><a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D22141">CorePlayer</a></b> - by default, the system has a standard player installed.  Accordingly, more simple and lightweight Vidic clicked like nuts. <br>  Does the communicator reproduce high-definition movies?  I do not know.  Watch this kind of video on a screen with a diagonal of 5 "" I see no reason) to display the image on the TV?  At least it was not found for this suitable lace, as a maximum - it would be good for these tasks to have a specialized device) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b66/8a9/36e/b668a936efa004058a0258151e27fe96.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/da8/244/bfa/da8244bfa2d9dc1ec369a641a98ee1f3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The phone also has a built-in YouTube player - it loads quickly and, in fact, is a redesigned interface of the site.  Very usable, but more in the case of an available wifi signal - I have never watched videos due to SIM) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/943/eb2/62b/943eb262b8f8aa4afea2ada39808cfd9.png" alt="image"><br><br>  It is a pity that in the video viewing mode the phone lasts only about 4-5 hours.  Ie, for example, this is quite enough for 1-2 films on the road, but after that you will have to be without communication) Soothes that I don‚Äôt watch video on my phone, preferring to read from an e-book) <br><br><h2>  Games </h2><br>  Initially, only one game was installed on HD2, which was still on Hero, and perhaps earlier.  Teeter is a game that uses the G-sensor device.  The meaning of the game is simple - tilting the phone in different directions, you need to roll the ball on the plane and try to roll it into the green hole.  <i>I am</i> ashamed to admit)) I haven‚Äôt yet met an interesting game for a toilet))) First you start it with the mood ‚Äú <i>I‚Äôll play once ...</i> ‚Äù, and then, after about 20 minutes, at the thirtieth level, you catch yourself thinking ‚ÄúI <i>got into a pancake to play ... so, now 1 more level and go out!</i>  ") In total, there are 32 levels in the game, starting with 17 there are levels with planes that are at an angle to each other.  If you have completed the game, try to go through it with one hand, or turn the device. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d4d/76a/fa2/d4d76afa238c903637cf24b642fa73e3.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d12/681/68d/d1268168d02a23dc03c6c88eabe4dce3.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The sensitivity of the device is excellent, in which case the G-sensor can be calibrated in the settings - two levels are displayed on the screen.  They can also be used when building a house))) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/561/f9d/0e5/561f9d0e5afb49fd211ad1d60b1c50a0.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The device has a three-dimensional accelerator with a capacity of 22 million polygons per second.  Here, for example, a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGfGoa6jmTFk">video</a> with the emulation of the game <b>Tekken3</b> on HD2 (on the same OmniaII, instead of the game, you can watch only a ‚Äúslide show‚Äù).  I agree, management is not convenient, but if you wish, you can pass the time.  There are a lot of games on w3bsit3-dns.com - with the participation of the G-sensor, with sharpening for 480x800 resolution and just by genre) I haven‚Äôt tried anything else ... I adored <b><a href="http://www.spbsoftwarehouse.com/pocketpc-software/brainevolution/">SPB Brain Evolution</a></b> in my time and I am sure that it will go here ... but there it‚Äôs better with the stylus I do not yet (in nature, for capacitive screens, the stylus is even very).  In short, the games to be! <br><br><h2>  Navigation </h2><br>  <b>Navitel 3.2</b> was originally installed as a navigator with maps of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.  I didn‚Äôt need anything more than Moscow and Moscow Region - details of the atlas of 10 and 1 km.  All in detail, with house numbers and a bunch of POI - all that may be required.  The navigator starts quickly, works without problems, there is also a multitouch (for example, for zoom).  In case you need information about traffic jams, you can get it through GPRS / EDGE.  Even at the maximum level of detail, you can safely run ICQ and the opera - there will be no message about the lack of memory.  Again, the best part is the screen diagonal.  There is always a place for two fingers for a multitouch distance-approximation, despite the fact that there are large icons around the perimeter. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ef4/692/e75/ef4692e7591a5e1f802aeddc3d3eea04.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ca7/e5e/469/ca7e5e469ef53c7bf71e9b0d582b6a37.png" alt="image"><br><br>  The second program, which is related to maps - <b>GoogleMaps</b> , works all over the world) Multi-touch, excellent detailing and fast drawing of maps (albeit, only if working via WiFi - over a cellular network much slower).  Unfortunately, it is not entered into the cache ((( <br>  Well, there is some kind of compass, in the form of an application ... I don‚Äôt know how much it is in demand. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1b1/a1a/934/1b1a1a934e1110e2ef73ade3ed9d250f.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/30b/4ee/ee7/30b4eeee7722cbc816a9c48d4cbb9db3.png" alt="image"><br><br><h2>  Camera </h2><br>  A five-megapixel camera takes pictures with a resolution of 2592x1552 (photo) and 640x480 (video).  Unlike the iPhone, it has a flash (of two LEDs).  There are 4 settings pages for photos, and 4 for video (can shoot in MPEG4, MotionJPEG, 3GPP2, H.263 and H.264. <br>  The quality of the photo is not bad, it allows you to make good pictures (especially with good lighting), but, as I said, in motion you get blurry.  Autofocus is there, you can also bring focus to where you put your finger on the screen - convenient!  The video is good. <br><br>  Photo examples: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f56/39a/0c2/f5639a0c2e02f7d9a415ca3bcc38bbd4.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c82/e28/74d/c82e2874d247df0ec371d98e15c7cf50.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/d89/5fd/0aa/d895fd0aa9dd5687ea139ae317fffb75.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/482/840/a99/482840a994fb0b680f00cf06e05e2d2d.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/6ab/033/efc/6ab033efc6e0d90cc1d77fa1805b16e1.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/b83/e83/610/b83e8361021b15a10c2502ef70c153e0.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dd0/3eb/d06/dd03ebd068f434b2b5485ca542e1dc2e.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a7f/8fc/166/a7f8fc1666b92af2ef42c2e12bb5e253.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/926/d14/035/926d14035a0e10aed961fe45458b8bfa.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a20/7c6/f0f/a207c6f0fef59a567f8569ead7b79be6.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/358/68e/907/35868e907ded060d42860d517b26aa78.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/11f/4d9/da8/11f4d9da8a779e8effe5bcbd07e28ba4.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  Sample video - <a href="http://narod.ru/disk/16949046000/0.mp4.html">download</a> (30 MB) <br><br><h2>  I almost forgot‚Ä¶ </h2><br>  Clicking "Start" or a hardware analogue button, a list of installed programs and other settings appears in front of the user.  On them it is also possible to move with a stroke - nothing slows down.  When installing new programs, their icons appear there - it turns out, often icons are simply of disgusting quality) <br><br>  Among all sorts of things, you can dig up a mobile office, Bing-search, compasses, calculators, notes, tasks, applications for working with Facebook, a wi-fi router. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c07/db3/0e7/c07db30e7089804b5457e04ba4a3a7cd.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9ad/ff2/1f6/9adff21f6c9be7b6a9e0679ed412c7f6.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9e3/f29/9a0/9e3f299a064818d1764c61d714c65a81.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/049/15e/3e1/04915e3e1a00839797c9493c30ae2ee3.png" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/154/62d/ff7/15462dff7cf8a91df638faf698f3daaf.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/291/76b/ecc/29176becc5cc2982a1cb72d25a482f7d.png" alt="image"><br><br>  There was a place for the Windows Marketplace - now fashionable online catalogs of software and programs.  In principle, as elsewhere - you choose a category, the desired program - you look at the description, screenshots and kamenty ... and, if necessary, you download.  There are not so many programs, but there are also quite good ones) I prefer w3bsit3-dns.com in this regard;) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/a2c/e0d/121/a2ce0d1216ccc1c88ce77a0524e2edc0.png" alt="image"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f92/0c8/7ea/f920c87ea68d1f1bdbcd2e4f12255a6a.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, it is impossible not to mention the wonderful program <b><a href="http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php%3Fp%3D5015406%26postcount%3D1">BSB Tweaks</a></b> , written specifically for this phone.  It allows you to ‚Äútweak‚Äù a lot of hidden settings, activate new functions (hmm, and even WiFi N?), Lower the sensitivity of the touch screen (initially it is VERY high) and make a lot of useful things (the same screenshots on ‚Äúshaking‚Äù, which contributed to writing articles).  Mastkhev. <br><br>  I understand that I didn‚Äôt tell everything far away - I wouldn‚Äôt like to inflate the review to the size that I want to sleep for;) However, if you want to find out anything else about this device, see the overview <a href="http://mobile.mail.ru/reviews/htc/HTC_HD2-rev.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.mobile-review.com/pda/review/htc-hd2-part1.shtml">here</a> , as well as write questions in the comments! <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  In principle, all the text above could be replaced with just one video (I advise you to go over it and watch it in HD), but after all, in 10 minutes you‚Äôll not put everything in YouTube;) And still, I strongly recommend viewing it.

I will not say anything.  I will give only an inconspicuous link to the video comparison on HTC HD2 and 3GS.  Everything is clearly there and clearly written at the very end) An <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DHmrXrQUZgwE">inconspicuous link</a> :) And <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DGFVbEDHMhPk">here's</a> another one - with Omniall and XPeria X10 <br><br><h2>  Check weighing </h2><br>  <u>Pros:</u> <br>  - High-quality, practical and reliable body (without gloss, hurray !!!) from plastic, glass and metal; <br>  - Beautiful, comfortable and functional shell that can be used "out of the box"; <br>  - Huge colorful screen;  light sensor; <br>  - Good quality photos and video from the camera; <br>  - Vooooot such performance! <br>  - Meets 99% of my requirements) <br><br>  <u>Minuses:</u> <br>  - Small battery life; <br>  - Scanty grade.  For the flagship ... <br>  - Someone its size will be large; <br>  - I really wanted WiMax ... <br>  - High price. <br><br>  <u>Chips</u> : <br>  - The light sensor adjusts the brightness of the screen depending on external conditions; <br>  - Taking the phone out of your pocket or picking it up from the table, the sound of the bell diminishes; <br>  - Sensitive G-sensor; <br>  - non-scratch screen; <br><br>  Windows Mobile for me is not a plus or a minus, but an environment that I can use comfortably) <br><br><h2>  The end </h2><br>  In an interesting time we live, comrades!  Production technologies have reached the level where the user really has something to choose from.<font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"> Different form factors, materials, diagonals, interfaces - I don‚Äôt want to take it! </font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But the main character of the review is interesting not only by the composition of the technology fusion and its record-breaking breed as a whole. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Something tells me that this is the last (or the penultimate) device from HTC of a similar level, made for WM. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">They say that it will be he who will be honored with an upgrade to Window Mobile 7, when she comes out (in 2011?) - even wondering what Bill will prepare this time (after all, in fact, this is his last chance). </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">But, I think, the days of WM are really numbered - most likely, all the subsequent HTC innovations will already be on the android - on the very one that is now thousands of idols, sometimes without even realizing the advantages of the new operating system) Well, wait and see. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">In any case, one should not expect a more productive device from HTC this year.</font></font><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">As for me, I‚Äôm not at all upset that Windows Mobile isn‚Äôt the brightest future yet. Because I have long decided on a set of programs that are sufficiently suited for all my tasks, the solutions of which I demand from the phone. And I know that these programs are not going anywhere) And even if something happens, you can always buy a new piece of hardware.</font></font><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">HTC HD2 made a great impression on me, causing only positive emotions and arranging for almost everyone. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">Attractive appearance, practical case, such performance and compliance with almost all my requirements - you see, you don‚Äôt feel sorry for anything like that) I admire them) There would be more work time ... but this, you know, is a reasonable price for everything else. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">So keep this in mind when shopping. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">For the rest, I strongly recommend it. </font><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">HTC is not upset once again - I think that after a couple of years, if I decide to upgrade, the brand will remain the same;) </font></font><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/ea3/788/1ac/ea37881ac360495b63a7cc10ac9382ce.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><font style="vertical-align: inherit;"><font style="vertical-align: inherit;">During testing, no device was damaged;) But, as you can see, glass screens are very vulnerable - protect yourself with covers.</font></font><br><br>  <b>Successes!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/80913/">https://habr.com/ru/post/80913/</a></p>
