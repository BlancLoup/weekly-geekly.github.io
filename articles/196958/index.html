For those who directly write code, thinks through the application architecture and tries to increase their productivity using new languages ‚Äã‚Äãand libraries.  In addition to the programmers themselves, the conference will be of interest to all those who are involved in the process of creating software products, who want to understand what developers are doing, to look at everything from the point of view of a programmer. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  A good developer knows that the set of tools that he could apply in his work is constantly expanding.  New languages, libraries, products are coming out.  What else did not have alternatives yesterday is obsolete today and is losing out to competing instruments.  It is the technical leader who has to follow the innovations and introduce new tools in his team.

      Alone it is rather difficult to cope with this task.  Especially when you still have a lot of tasks on the main project, and this is how it usually happens.  It would be nice to consult with someone, but for this you need to ask the right questions to the right people.  Where to find these people?  Of course, all people are on the Internet, and all the materials on all-all technologies, and all the news about all the updates, and another 100,500 reviews from those who have tried it, but they have failed. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/4bc/259/910/4bc2599105089256d2c392cd3e5797db.jpg" alt="image"></div><br><br>  The only problem is that reading the entire Internet will not work.  You should either already know what to read, or you will be lucky to find useful information in the free search mode.  Actually, an overabundance of information on the Internet is the main reason for the existence of conferences today (it used to be different). <br><br>  The idea is to gather people who know your subject in one place and make them talk to each other.  Someone talks, others listen.  Then, often, change places.  The conference is exactly the place where the programmer can disconnect from the daily routine and think carefully about what and how he is doing. <br><br>  Within Application Developer Days-4, there will be a discussion of a whole range of issues related to software development, choice of programming languages, consideration of successful architectural solutions and recommendations for their creation, consideration of the most popular technologies, products of well-known vendors and Open Source solutions. <br><br>  <b>Main themes:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Software architecture design <br>  ‚Ä¢ code writing techniques <br>  ‚Ä¢ Tools and development environments <br>  ‚Ä¢ Programming Technologies <br>  ‚Ä¢ Managing the development process <br>  ‚Ä¢ Modern trends in the world of software development <br>  Reports on ADD are helpful, and communication is actually fun.  And it is not just words.  All reports are recorded on video and published online shortly after the conference.  You can already read reports of past conferences and read reviews from participants.  Many reports provoked heated discussions for a long time after the conference. <br><br>  The conference will be attended by experts from reputable domestic and foreign companies, invited "IT gurus", thematic communities, consultants and consulting agencies in the field of information technology, product vendors, representatives of relevant departments of universities. <br><br>  <b>It will be the right people.</b>  <b>In addition, many at once and in one place!</b> <br><br>  Application Developer Days consists not only of reports, but also of live communication.  Programmers are silent for so long and with taste that sometimes they just need to talk to like-minded people.  Ask the speaker, argue out loud, discuss a fresh idea.  This is important, and we will do everything to make such communication enjoyable. <br><br>  Application Developer Days will be interesting and useful to representatives of offshore programming business, project managers, architects, analysts, developers, software quality and quality assurance specialists, implementation specialists, software security specialists, middle and top managers (department heads, project and department directors) and all interested parties. <br><br>  Each participant will be able not only to listen to the reports and get professional answers to relevant questions, but also to participate in one of the round tables or seminars, to establish new partner contacts.  We also invite you to speak at the conference with your report or presentation.  You can apply here: <a href="http://www.confeture.com/conferences/112-application-developer-days-4">Submit a Report</a> . <br><br>  <b>Format and program of the conference:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ The conference consists of three parallel sections. <br>  ‚Ä¢ Conference duration - 1 day. <br><br>  <b>Participants are waiting for:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ practical workshops of leading experts in software engineering; <br>  ‚Ä¢ stories about examples of successful problem solving in various areas of software development; <br>  ‚Ä¢ research reports; <br>  ‚Ä¢ round tables and panel discussions; <br>  ‚Ä¢ presentation of technical solutions; <br>  ‚Ä¢ and many many others. <br><br>  <b>Subjects of the conference reports:</b> <br>  ‚Ä¢ Practice solving specific applied problems; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Software architecture; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Techniques of writing code; <br>  ‚Ä¢ development environments; <br>  ‚Ä¢ programming technologies; <br>  ‚Ä¢ Trends in software development. <br><br>  The official program of the Conference will be finally determined after the competitive selection of reports by the program committee. <br><br>  The Application Developer Days conference will meet in Belarus for the first time! <br><br>  Official site of the 4th conference <a href="http://add4.addconf.ru/">http://add4.addconf.ru</a> . <br><br>  Also on the conference website <a href="http://www.addconf.ru/">http://www.addconf.ru</a> you can find presentations and video reports of past conferences. <br><br>  The general partner of the conference is <a href="http://by.r-style.com/">R-Style Belarus</a> , one of the leaders in the IT industry in Minsk, a partner of the world's leading corporations.  R-Style Belarus is part of the R-Style holding, a leading Russian system integrator and supplier of corporate solutions. <br><br>  <b>See you at the conference!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/196958/">https://habr.com/ru/post/196958/</a></p>
