Part 1 (1-25)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f7c/2ab/65e/f7c2ab65e01c8fa36839228690725248.gif" alt="image">  Most bloggers respect their RSS subscribers.  Most bloggers are keen to get new RSS readers.  It's so great when you woke up in the morning and see that your Feedburner counter jumped 200 or 300. <br>  <strong>1. Set a large RSS icon.</strong>  People are lazy.  You must remember this always.  If you use a small, and even an elegant RSS icon, visitors may find it difficult to find it.  Most of those looking for the icon will give up after a few seconds, so make sure the RSS icon is large and well visible. <br>  <strong>2. Be sure that the RSS icon is visible on the first screen</strong> so that the potential subscriber does not have to search for it. <br>  <strong>3. Display the RSS icon on every page of your blog.</strong> <br>  <strong>4. Use phrases to attract attention.</strong>  If your audience is IT-savvy readers, then the orange icon will be enough for them, and if you are an ordinary audience, write them something about the usefulness of RSS. <br>  <strong>5. Write a post inviting your readers to subscribe.</strong>  It works in many different areas. <br>  <strong>6. Use the FeedSmith plugin.</strong>  This will make the subscription more convenient not only for your readers, but also for you as you will be able to keep track of the number of subscribers. <br>  <strong>7. Offer to send RSS to e-mail.</strong>  Only a small percentage of Internet users use RSS feeds.  Research confirms that this number is even below 10% of the world.  Why miss the other 90% of the pie?  If you use Feedburner, you only need to go to the <strong>‚ÄúPublicize‚Äù</strong> tab to activate your email subscriptions. <br>  <strong>8. Use the mail subscription form.</strong>  For most visitors, the postal subscription form is more convenient than the simple ‚ÄúSubscribe to news via mail‚Äù.  The fact is that Internet users are used to seeing such forms everywhere and filling them out.  Place it, as expected, at the top of the sidebar. <br>  <strong>9. Post a call to subscribe to the RSS at the bottom of each post.</strong>  After reading a useful post, many people will want to subscribe. <br>  <strong>10. As few steps as possible.</strong>  People are lazy (I know I mentioned this before, but it‚Äôs worth re-emphasizing).  The fewer steps you need to subscribe to your blog, the better. <br>  <strong>11. Install widgets to quickly subscribe to the most popular RSS-readers</strong> .  Use only those that really use in your subject. <br>  <strong>12. Thematic focus of your blog.</strong>  If you cover 10 different topics at the same time, it will be difficult to convince people to subscribe to your blog.  They may like your SEO articles, but they don‚Äôt want to receive news about your student life at the same time.  Having a clear focus is one of the most effective ways to attract RSS subscribers. <br>  <strong>13. Post new posts often and regularly.</strong>  Stick to your chosen tempo. <br>  <strong>14. Do not write too many posts.</strong>  If you are so productive, then start another blog. <br>  <strong>15. Publish really valuable content.</strong>  People will only subscribe to your RSS feed if they think it will be <strong>useful for</strong> them <strong>(!)</strong> . <br>  <strong>16. Publish unique content.</strong>  Your content may be valuable, but if people can take it in other more reputable places, they will not subscribe to your RSS feeds.  For example, suppose that you copy all the posts from the popular blog of your niche, say <a href="http://blog.dimok.ru/" title="site promotion promotion">Dimok</a> .  Your content will be valuable, but not unique, and most will prefer a subscription to the original RSS feed. <br>  <strong>17. Do not go to offtopic.</strong>  A bad post or a non-topic post is worse than a complete post. <br>  <strong>18. Use your RSS feed when commenting on other blogs.</strong>  For example, you can leave a link to your RSS feed in your comments. <br>  <strong>19. Participate in the popular blogosphere contest.</strong>  Both your competitors and fans will simply want to follow your battle for the prize and subscribe to RSS.  Be sure to use the method number 7. <br>  <strong>20. Offer prizes to your subscribers</strong> .  If you can give something away for free, do it.  Someone may offer a month of using a certain service for free for a certain number of times or for a while. <br>  <strong>21. Write guest posts to popular <a href="http://www.promo2.ru/%3Fp%3D41" title="site promotion">blogs in your niche</a> .</strong> <br>  <strong>22. Welcome new subscribers.</strong>  Whenever you get a surge in the number of subscribers, write a small post - a grateful greeting. <br>  <strong>23. Become popular on thematic social networks.</strong>  The traffic from there, though worse, than from search engines, but depending on the quality of your blog can bring a lot of new RSS subscribers. <br>  <strong>24. Write a post about what RSS is.</strong>  This will be especially useful if you do not have an IT blog. <br>  <strong>25. Create a special page "News Subscriptions"</strong> with all the necessary detailed information and links. <br>  to be continued - look at my <a href="http://promo2.ru/">blog</a> <br>  If you want, <strong>you can subscribe to the</strong> <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/promo2" title="site promotion promotion"><strong>RSS of my blog</strong></a> , then you will not have to look at the blog in anticipation of continuing this list, and indeed my blog is getting better and better day by day.  <strong>It will be very useful for all if you, after reading this post in the comments indicate the number of the 3 most valuable, in your opinion, advice.</strong> </div>
