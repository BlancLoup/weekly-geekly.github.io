  <section class="page js-page"><h1>A revolution is ripening in Belarus ... IT shnaya</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  About 3 years ago, Igor Mamonenko, the general director of the well-known Belarusian company BelHard, proposed a draft concept for the ‚ÄúNational Program for the creation in Belarus of one of the world's software development centers IT-STRANA‚Äù.  A few months ago, the concept was approved by the Council of Ministers, and it was discussed at a meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister.  It is currently being reviewed by the Presidential Administration.  If the draft concept is approved, then in the coming months we will start a massive retraining for IT-specialists.  Particularly noteworthy is the fact that the program affects not only and not so much the existing IT specialists, as all those who want to obtain relevant knowledge and skills, but mainly - accountants ... <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  The effect of "Indian miracle" </h4><br>  Development and supply of software (software) for an external customer (outsourcing) - is today one of the most dynamically developing types of business, because the volume of services using IT-technologies has increased by 20-30 percent every year over the last ten years!  Countries that understood this on time are now making good money on it.  For example, India in 2009 exported IT-services for 50 billion dollars! <br>  How was this possible?  In 1998, the IT Task Force was established under the Government of India.  He proposed a program to develop the information technology industry for 10 years.  As part of it, it was planned to develop modern telecommunication networks capable of providing data transmission in the country and abroad;  introduce information technologies in all spheres of life within India (now the volume of IT-projects for their own needs reaches $ 6 billion annually).  But the main thing is to achieve in 10 years the volume of IT exports of 50 billion dollars (the latter was possible with a delay of 1 year). <br>  At the same time, the majority of new specialists were actually trained from scratch (it‚Äôs no secret that only 6.54 percent of the population in India have a higher education, 35.7 percent of the population are completely illiterate), the annual staff shortage was 200 thousand people.  The education system for the needs of the industry was created in a limited time and cracked at the seams from the influx of people who wanted to escape from poverty.  Nevertheless, thanks to the project, more than 2 million IT specialists of various specialties and qualifications appeared, and India today is considered the number one outsourcing service provider worldwide.  The cumulative capitalization of the Indian IT market exceeds $ 225 billion. <br><br><h4>  300 thousand accountants will be retrained into programmers ... </h4><br>  Belarusian IT-specialists, unfortunately, only 25 thousand people.  Although the share of Belarus in the global export of IT services has increased more than five times over the past 7 years, it still remains relatively low - 0.1 percent.  The total volume of exports of IT services is 159.1 million dollars.  Igor Mamonenko believes that Belarus, being in the center in the center of Europe, and having where nearly 50 percent of the working population with higher and secondary special education, has the right to expect more.  In his opinion, having retrained about 300 thousand people to various IT specialties, we can increase the volume of export of IT services by $ 7 billion! <br>  It is possible to provide the industry with new human resources through retraining specialists from other areas of economic activity - people who, in principle, would like to change their occupation, as well as ... accountants.  The latter sounds a bit intimidating, but Igor Mamonenko asks to recall the early 1990s.  Then our country gained independence, a market economy began to develop, small enterprises began to emerge rapidly.  Each such enterprise, despite its size, was supposed to have a director, chief accountant, a bank account and a seal.  Previously technologists, physicists, chemists, mechanics, teachers and workers in other branches of the once omnipotent mastered the skills of an accountant profession. <br>  socialist economy.  For 10 years, more than 300 thousand accountants have been trained.  And computers then for many were curiously.  We have actually been successfully completed the path of large-scale retraining. <br>  Today in Belarus there are about 400 thousand accountants.  Their jobs and salaries cost our country over $ 3 billion annually.  According to the World Bank, it takes an average of 900 hours per year to keep an enterprise‚Äôs accounting in Belarus.  The World Bank recommends reducing this figure to 160 hours (for comparison: in China, Sweden, it takes 10-50 hours to account, in the UAE - 12 altogether - processes are computerized everywhere). <br>  IT The country offers a phased reduction in all kinds of reporting and a phased release of redundant personnel.  For example, once in half a year legislation will be simplified, on which the volume of work of an accountant depends.  We say that in five years we will reach the figure of 50 hours instead of 900. But what path this 900 -800-700 ... -50 or 900-750-500 will be ...- 50 this will be determined by the dynamics of the change in the need for programmers.  More programmers will be needed - we will simplify legislation quickly.  All this is seen as a regulated process. <br>  Other capacity with personnel reserve is ITR.  The introduction of information technology in enterprises will free up about 200 thousand people there for the IT industry.  "In total, about 500 thousand people can be freed, 300 thousand of whom will become programmers, and 200 thousand will leave to build and maintain infrastructure."

    <h4>  Become an IT specialist will help ... KGB tests </h4><br>  The learning process will be preceded by testing aimed at determining the ability of a person in principle to work in the field of IT and in which of its 80 specialties.  It should be noted that this idea is not new.  For example, when applying for a job at IBM, employees can test during the day in order to determine the conditions under which the employee will receive the highest return.  In Belarus, there is an idea to use ... the KGB tests.  ‚ÄúA review of the test systems that exist in the world that can provide a detailed psychological portrait of a person suggested that our intelligence services, since the Soviet times, have some of the best tests of their kind.  We would like to ask the Belarusian KGB to participate in the IT country and work out with us these tests to meet the needs of the IT industry.  To recognize in a person the ability to be a good project manager, we will compare his test results with the results of really good managers.  So in other specialties ¬ª <br>  If the following subjects are close to the ‚Äúideal specialist‚Äù, they can recommend this specialty. But in any case, the tests will be recommendatory.  Thanks to them, it is possible to determine the inclinations of a person as a whole: that, for example, he is a business analyst at 5 percent, a manager at 10, a programmer at 15, and in fact he can make a good tester. <br><br><h4>  "This is a chance for any intelligent person." </h4><br>  Today in the field of IT there are 5 basic types of specialties.  In addition to programmers (process engineering) and software testers (software testing), project managers (project manager, software quality assurance, and business analytic) play a very important role in the success of an IT project.  The IT education system existing in Belarus prepares mostly programmers and testers - as a result, the situation is more or less with these cadres.  But representatives of other specialties - in acute shortage.  In fact, these specialists are already studying in the process of work in firms.  ‚ÄúMeanwhile, - says Igor Viktorovich, - the success of the project up to 80 percent depends on the manager‚Äù <br>  The three-level management training system.  The first level is the team leader of 3-5 people - a team leader (similar to the squad leader in the army).  Level two is the manager of a single project - project manager (officer).  And the level of the third coordinator of several projects - project coordinator (general).  But since from 1 to 1000 people can participate in one project, the basket of necessary knowledge for a manager can be very different. <br>  A business analyst is a person who negotiates with a customer, figuring out what the final software product should be.  The result of his work is a document that sets out customer requirements for software.  In the future, this document will be a guide to action for programmers.  If the business analyst does not correctly understand the customer, then before identifying this error, a lot of unnecessary work can be done, which will have to be corrected at his own expense.  Therefore, the business analyst must know foreign languages, understand the laws of the functioning of society and business, and be sociable.  ‚ÄúA good business analyst, while negotiating, does not so much clarify the customer‚Äôs wishes, as he offers him a counter list of options known to him from personal experience and from generalized world information obtained both from training courses and through specialized information sources.  For good business analysts (and bad ones do not survive there) there is no comic competition between firms.  Their salaries, along with bonuses, can amount to several thousand dollars.  In my opinion, this is a good chance for any intelligent person to live interestingly and with dignity. ‚Äù <br>  IT industry specialists also need constant retraining - in some specialties the curriculum may change by 90% per year, due to the tremendous pace of information updates in the IT industry.  The courses themselves, depending on the specialty and its level, can take from 1 to 8 weeks.  The training of business analysts has already started in June.  For 10 days, the specialists studied independently, then listened to lectures online.  ‚ÄúThey had to go through 3 programs:‚Äú business analyst ‚Äù,‚Äú teacher for business analyst ‚Äù,‚Äú teacher for instructor ‚Äù, the source continues.  - Out of 2,000 resumes, several dozen people were chosen from those who wanted to study, but only five were admitted to the last exam.  At the end of June, courses for project management instructors will begin.  If you feel a talent - call. <br>  For the implementation of "IT-COUNTRY" in Belarus should be trained about 2 thousand teachers of various IT disciplines.  The proportion in specialties will depend on how large the share of the Belarusian side in total labor costs for developing software for an external customer will be.  For a mature labor market, the total share of business analysis and management specialists may exceed 30% of the total number of specialists.  In September, we plan to train teachers for the discipline of software quality assurance and further down the list from the most mass specialties to less.  Any educational institution in Belarus can prepare our teachers and get access to educational materials and the latest methods of teaching IT disciplines.  It is planned that the benefits of Presidential Decree No. 12 ‚ÄúOn HTP‚Äù will be extended to IT training. <br>  The main working tool of the project will be a special website with almost daily monitoring of the activities of the HTP residents and the Infopark for all the main indicators.  Based on this statistics, the pace of legislation reform affecting the release of personnel from inefficient industries will be modeled, the demand for specialists and the services of training centers will be predicted.  Those residents who do not want to report will be dismissed from parks. <br><br><h4>  Learn at PM in each district center </h4><br>  But it is also necessary to further develop the legislative base in the field of copyright protection, labor legislation, investment, and most importantly - education.  Significant benefits are needed for those who wish to undergo training so that it would be beneficial for people to study.  Today, the cost of training for QAI students (international center for training IT specialists) is $ 10 without VAT per hour.  The course "project manager" - 90 hours.  That is, training will cost $ 900 without VAT.  ‚ÄúWe want the opportunity to study for everyone, regardless of the basic specialty, and not only in such large IT companies as IBA, EPAM or BelHard, but also in any regional center,‚Äù Igor Viktorovich emphasizes. <br><br><h4>  ‚ÄúTo live and work on a different scale‚Äù </h4><br>  In fact, companies with 20-50 thousand people may appear in the country.  According to Igor Mamonenko, there are more chances for companies to grow as a company with self-supporting units.  Belarus will not have enough money for development at such rates, but we will be attractive for investors in the IT industry.  ‚ÄúIn India, those who invested $ 1 at the start, received $ 45 in 2008,‚Äù the source said.  - Here, the growth of capitalization can be twice as high.  An IT company with 20 thousand people costs 5 billion dollars.  We must learn to be effective and generally be able to live on a different scale. ‚Äù <br>  One of the most important aspects of the project is external and internal marketing.  All communication channels should tell that Belarus is an ideal place for software development.  Here are established business processes, a high degree of informatization, there is IP-telephony, IT-visas are issued, which provide for a free and efficient receipt of a visa.  Only in this way foreigners will understand that they will not be deceived here, they will do everything qualitatively, and therefore they should come here.  Media campaigning will be aimed at creating the image of a new industry and its professions.  And this is not just about articles in newspapers or radio interviews, but also about thematic talk and reality shows that would explain the advantages of this profession, how easy or difficult it is to learn a particular profession, what are the prospects for specialists. <br>  ‚ÄúThis is a project in which the main is the intellectual potential of the inhabitants of Belarus.  We already have it and cannot disappear anywhere.  Today we also have the knowledge to tune this intellectual power to the growing needs of the outside world in IT services and IT products.  This is the key to our success. ‚Äù <br>  The most important factor in projects of this scale is state support.  By the time India reached $ 50 billion in IT exports, China's equivalent figures, which did not have a program of state support for the industry, amounted to only 3.3 billion!  But our correspondent was assured that the leadership of our state supports the project.  Then we wait for official news. <br><br>  Julia Khadnevich for oboz.by and habr.ru </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/101021/">https://habr.com/ru/post/101021/</a></p>
