How many are there?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The battery life is one of the most criticized parameters of modern smart watches.  And each manufacturer is chosen differently to solve the problem.  Recently, there are more and more options when the clock should work forever, ‚Äúfeeding on‚Äù heat, sun, <s>holy spirit</s> , kinetic energy, etc. We have collected some of the most vivid examples, concepts, prototypes and working gadgets in this collection. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5h/hr/pg/5hhrpgtglj5t3_aodekxtij85fq.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  First of all, we need to designate that we will not consider options for clocks that simply can work for a long time on battery: here we can include a hundred ‚Äúhybrids‚Äù.  I inserted the CR2032 and for a year forgot about the need for some kind of charging. <br><br>  Another thing is that for most users a watch that can work for a year or two and a watch that does not need to be charged is never the same thing, after all, such examples are not exactly the same.

    <h2>  LunaR - solar energy </h2><br>  LunaR is an eternal hybrid smart watch, the <a href="https://lunar-smartwatch.com/">cost of which is $ 299</a> .  The source of uninterrupted power for them is solar energy, which is collected in an integrated panel. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/x7/p6/vf/x7p6vfkgqniwicdemoc6u_2d1ju.jpeg"><br><br>  The watch supports two time zones, analyzes physical activity and receives notifications, which are displayed on the display as diode signals.  Works in tandem with a smartphone. <br><br>  According to the developer, an hour of stay in natural light or a few hours in artificial light is enough to provide a continuous supply of energy.  In this case, of course, we must remember that the display of the clock should not be hidden by the sleeves of clothing! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ad/r4/ns/adr4nsrzp9dfaen8ounhtrtzn9w.jpeg"><br><br>  The amount of energy collected is available in the mobile application. <br><br><h2>  SEQUENT - kinetic energy </h2><br>  This is perhaps one of the most promising projects that is still <a href="http://www.sequentwatch.com/">under development</a> .  <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/sequent-the-world-s-first-self-charging-smartwatch">Pre-order</a> can be issued on Indiegogo (Kickstarter <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1608034664/sequent-the-worlds-first-kinetic-self-charging-sma">has already</a> collected a fair amount of money).  The cost of "early" - $ 400. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/is/y0/5u/isy05uw5szb-mrlwinmobyqu7kc.jpeg"><br><br>  The clock promises an eternal power reserve, the energy for which will be provided by kinetic energy: if you move, the clock is charged. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/vq/af/je/vqafjewi-eakwmw0vwh-ytqelca.gif"><br><br>  In this case, the model will be able to support such sensors as the heart rate monitor and GPS, which are quite energy-intensive. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/sp/88/nb/sp88nbxfbysytlhqrevbgwo6hxc.png"><br><br>  Steps, calories, notifications - wherever without them.  Looks like something fantastic. <br><br><h2>  Frederique Constant - "Newest Solar Panels" </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/ds/hw/um/dshwumkx5lz10d0n0wz7kgobi7e.jpeg"><br><br>  At the moment - this is more of a concept, not even a prototype, and Frederique Constant is in the subtitle rather for attracting attention. <br><br>  The fact is that the technology partner of the brand, who participated in the development of smart watches for the company earlier, is <a href="https://www.wareable.com/news/mmt-is-developing-a-hybrid-smartwatch-that-never-needs-charging-6493">working</a> on technology.  The talk is still about hybrid watches, in which the ‚Äúnewest‚Äù solar panel will be integrated, which will accumulate so much energy in an hour that it is enough to count steps and receive notifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/5h/hr/pg/5hhrpgtglj5t3_aodekxtij85fq.jpeg"><br><br>  In general, it looks like LunaR. <br><br><h2>  Matrix PowerWatch X - thermoelectric element </h2><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jg/hb/tg/jghbtgifl1pkxy1mji1pabo_wa4.jpeg"><br><br>  <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/matrix-powerwatch-x.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpowerwatch%26utm_campaign%3Dx">Matrix PowerWatch</a> is already a serial copy that you can buy.  The watch comes in three versions: two models are ‚Äúwatch-pedometers‚Äù, model X is a smart watch with the ability to receive notifications. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xi/gn/8g/xign8g1odmgy86s7q5ycnoo0n_o.jpeg"><br><br>  At the heart of the work Seebeck effect, opened in 1821.  The bottom line is that a thermocouple of different materials with a temperature difference is capable of producing a certain amount of energy, which can be enough for anything: in this case, the work of a pedometer, a sleep tracker, notifications, and a digital clock.  Yes, unlike all models from the list - Matrix - digital models. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/cd/qm/-4/cdqm-4--ytdzus9_qopjiemecua.gif"><br><br>  The heating element in this context will be your wrist in contact with the back of the case.  The external "cooler" will be the external environment.  The charge index and temperature difference will be displayed.  In an especially hot climate, the clock may not charge, but in this case, the accumulated energy is enough - up to one year of autonomous work. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/1y/vh/ax/1yvhaxbgn7v3c_gunt9woquamoe.jpeg"><br>  <i>With the new firmware version, PowerWatch X got a localized display.</i> <br><br><div class="spoiler">  <b class="spoiler_title">We have a coupon</b> <div class="spoiler_text">  On the <a href="https://medgadgets.ru/shop/matrix-powerwatch-x.html%3Futm_source%3Dhabr%26utm_medium%3Dpowerwatch%26utm_campaign%3Dx">model X</a> until the end of October there is a 10% discount - <b>HBRX</b> . <br></div></div><br>  Matrix is ‚Äã‚Äãnot the first to experiment with this method of charging gadgets.  One of the earliest cases is the <a href="https://doensen.home.xs4all.nl/p.html">Bulova Thermatron</a> model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/po/ao/_5/poao_5kej0m_iwnnyewdfmiwwz0.jpeg"><br><br>  In 1980, the watches turned out to be too expensive, and the model almost did not remember the market, so that after almost 20 years Seiko was shown the Thermic model, which was based on the same principle of power, everything went as if in a new way. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/6e/fw/yt/6efwyte2vrhaevzzrlmeny5tfqe.jpeg"><br><br>  The viability of this model was attempted to be confirmed in Citizen by the Eco-Drive Thermo model. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/te/77/_4/te77_4wxrqikxuh4r2gi3ntbkna.jpeg"><br><br>  However, in each of these cases we are not talking about smart watches: these are the usual ‚Äúswitch‚Äù models without any additional functions for their owners. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/427533/">https://habr.com/ru/post/427533/</a></p>
