  <section class="page js-page"><h1>People who play games ... together</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The staff of the company is the number of employees.  Different people gathered together.  What else unites us, except for the love of his work? <br><br>  Among us there are fans of computer, desktop, as well as outdoor games, so periodically we get together to play something.  I will not discuss computer battles in this post, as it‚Äôs not enough that you can‚Äôt immediately see what people are doing at the computer, but you can also play by distance: shout to each other on Skype or live, without being face to face with adversary / companion.  I'll tell you about the gatherings at the table, about the office and street activities.  But first things first. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  So, at one time, we gladly gathered in a meeting room (the code name of which is ‚Äúcabinet‚Äù) and played poker.  At the appointed time, all comers came and played, of course, not for money, but with real excitement!

      Then we, thanks to the existence in our team of true lovers of nastol, diversified our arsenal of games, adding Civilization and Eclipse.  True, these are quite complex and long games, especially for the first time.  But we have prepared: a multi-page description and step-by-step instructions were thoroughly studied by each participant before the start of the games.  And after a while it was already possible to congratulate the winner.  Thus, today we have already mastered a bunch of games, including: Small world, Tempus, Colonialists, Munchkin, Dracula's Fury, desktop Starcraft, Nexus ops, Horror arkhema ... And this collection continues to grow! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0be/397/77c/0be39777c7765580717a5811c4ae6089.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Also, perhaps, it is worth mentioning the fun of employees during the work process.  Some have on their tables, in addition to work accessories, a small plush little animal, which can be tortured not only by the employee himself, but also by the other guys in turn. <br><br>  Sometimes a whole animal fight is played, but usually the toys are friendly.  And we also have a collection of ponyash!  There are darts hanging in the developers room and large colored plastic blasters firing suction cups.  They play darts into the account, and from the blaster they shoot at aluminum cans that are placed on the board, where, in addition to the working information, the number of participants and their points are recorded. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83d/4c5/bae/83d4c5bae385dc22c47beac1b437fc87.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  And once, in February of some year, the girls gave the boys a big table football.  These tables are in Harats pub'ax, and to play, you only need to ask for a game ball, which is located at the bartenders.  We have this, frankly, noisy fun is legal in the "big break" when employees have lunch time, and in the evening when most workers are going to go home.  Complete table football tournaments are taking place!  But in the usual, street, we also play.  And also in volleyball.  But this is all - in the summer, and now the season is snowy, we will soon skate and play hockey. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fc3/36d/fb2/fc336dfb2c921a87fc09f56d826fe3e9.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  We recently played a game of outdoor laser tag.  The location was chosen four-storey unfinished.  Played capture points, divided into two teams.  Someone already had the experience of such entertainment, someone played in the room, and there were those for whom laser tag is a novelty.  But everyone liked the game, regardless of previous experience, victories, defeats and combat injuries!  We agreed to get together and play more. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1f3/92f/e50/1f392fe50f4ac798b230edfcd208c978.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  That's how we have fun, distracting from work, to dive into it again with new forces and fresh eyes! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/161417/">https://habr.com/ru/post/161417/</a></p>
