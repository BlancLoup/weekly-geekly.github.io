But this is almost never talked about.  This has not become a fashion trend. </p><br><br><h2>  We play numbers, and numbers play us </h2><br><p>  Why no one sums up the decade?  Firstly, because to say: ‚ÄúZero Years‚Äù is somehow not convenient.  And the next decade is also no better: ‚ÄúDecades‚Äù.  So the posters for the New Year like: ‚ÄúFarewell to the twentieth, hello the thirties‚Äù will appear not earlier than in 20 years. </p><br><br><p>  In addition, the division of time into decades is generally very conditional.  If not to say dubious.  But so convenient for us.  And we will divide the newest history into decades. </p>

    <h2>  Colorful decades of the last century </h2><br><p>  How easily and clearly we divided the near past into a decade.  Here is a simple example: </p><br><p>  - the youth of the 50s dreamed of being strong; <br>  - the youth of the 60s dreamed of being romantic; <br>  - young people of the 70s dreamed of being fashionable; <br>  - the youth of the 80s dreamed of being sports; <br>  - the youth of the 90s dreamed of being funny. </p><br><br><p>  And what can we tell about the youth of zero years?  What she wanted to be at this time? </p><br><br><p>  I would venture to express my subjective opinion and hang the first label: </p><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h2>  Zero's youth dreamed of being gadget hung </h2><br><p>  Yes, just like that: gadget compressed.  Here are four gadgets, without which we did not live in the first decade of the new century: </p><br>  - mobile phone or communicator; <br>  - digital camera; <br>  - flash drive; <br>  - mp3 player. <br><br><h2>  Her Majesty Mobile </h2><br><p>  During this decade, the mobile phone has turned from an expensive thing into a daily routine.  His visible antenna fell off, the screen increased, it became colored.  The phone absorbed the video and photo camera, notebook, Internet connection, mp3 player and USB flash drive.  And although we don‚Äôt use much of a damn thing, it's nice that we have all this in our pockets. </p><br><br><h2>  Digital camera </h2><br><p>  Yes, digital cameras are now for everyone.  And it first of all sharply raised the quality of photos.  The ability to shoot a lot, the ability to immediately see the composition and exposure, the powerful resources of Photoshop did their job.  Today a sensible young photographer shoots better than the wise and experienced.  Just because in his hands a new tool. </p><br><br><h2>  Flash drive </h2><br><p>  A flash drive settled everywhere: in a handbag, in a jeans pocket, in an expensive leather briefcase.  On it are documents, photos, films, programs.  Install operating systems on it.  Many are already nostalgic for DVD-RW. </p><br><br><p>  Although the flash drive itself may suffer the fate of extinction - in the future, perhaps the data will be synchronized with storage servers (thanks to <a href="http://lam0x86.habrahabr.ru/">lam0x86</a> ). </p><br><br><h2>  MP3 player </h2><br><p>  Although it is dying off as a separate type of device, because it migrates to a mobile phone, but in this decade, the MP3 player was an important gadget.  He discovered a new degree of freedom. </p><br><br><h2>  Advanced Gadgets </h2><br><p>  The above gadgets for the masses.  There are gadgets for advanced.  I will not talk about them in detail, just list: </p><br><p>  - netbooks; <br>  - book readers; <br>  - GPS-navigators; <br>  - different USB gadgets; <br>  - androids (even if it is a phone, but it is no longer just a phone); <br>  - gaming mobile consoles. </p><br><br><p>  At the beginning of the decade, the PDA was an important gadget for advanced users (thanks for the hint <a href="http://ppiskun.habrahabr.ru/">ppiskun</a> ).  By the end of the zero PDA also migrated to mobile phones. </p><br><br><h2>  Main gadget: Internet </h2><br><p>  At the beginning of the decade there was a joke about the fridge with Internet access.  Now she is not funny, because: </p><br><p>  - this is really technically, <br>  - it's not expensive, <br>  - it remains only to come up with a practical use of the Internet in the refrigerator, and it will immediately become a reality. </p><br><br><p>  Fast, mobile and unlimited internet has become a common need.  The Internet is not a gadget, of course.  But the gadget without going online is becoming something very vintage. </p><br><br><p>  <a href="http://elenara.habrahabr.ru/">Elena Rodionova</a> even offered <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/generatum/blog/79786/">her own version of</a> what the youth of her zero years dreamed of: legal. </p><br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br><p>  That's all that I wanted to tell the habrasoobschestvu.  The main trend of the past decade was: apart from the gadgets, we no longer live.  In the zero years it was fashionable, and then it will be just necessary. </p><br><br><p>  I would be very happy to hear from habrap additions to the list of important gadgets of the past decade. </p><br><br><p>  Text writer Vadim Galkin.
