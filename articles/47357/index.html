  <section class="page js-page"><h1>About two different ways to get paid</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  An interesting concept was formulated in disputes about the harm of freelancing in a local forum: for a web developer, if he wants some interesting perspectives, there may be two options: either go to one of the leading companies for a good position and work only there, or work independently . <br><br>  The main plus of a permanent job is, of course, a steady income.  The second important plus is the opportunity to take part in large projects.  The main disadvantage is that the amount of your own income directly depends on how well your superiors work and how well the company has a good position in the market.  The second important disadvantage is that your role is often defined and unchanged, you have to follow the instructions and instructions, to perform official duties. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  From here an important conclusion - work in the company is not necessary for the one who agrees to undertake all the work on the organization of labor and the realization of its result.  Permanent work in the company is needed to those who want more stability in life.  Here, the right choice is to work in a leading company, because it gives much more experience and provides real financial stability. <br><br>  What does it mean for me to work independently?  This is what is called ‚Äúfreelancing‚Äù in the early stages, and then it has to turn into your own business, or stable partnership with one or several customers.

      It is easy to list the advantages of independent work: is it social mobility, flexible schedule, more life experience and generally drive through life :) More money?  Not always, but the income is always proportional to the work done, and indeed, the income is almost entirely dependent only on yourself.  No one in the world can "call" you into the office and arrange a "beating" (again, except for yourself).  All your projects are really your projects, the pleasure from the work done is a hundred times more. <br><br>  The main disadvantage is that you are always at work and you need to constantly look for orders.  There are failures when there is little money.  Difficulties - you need to pay taxes yourself and make health insurance, you need to be able to communicate with people - with customers, with partners, with assistants, you need to understand the basic economic laws (and generally, get used to think immediately on your own). <br><br>  In general, there is someone like that. <br><br>  The big boss from YCombinator wrote in his article (I will say not literally, but also in the meaning): ‚Äúthink, before, it was wild for people that they could live in the city, among the stone, and eat food that they did not grow themselves;  it is also now considered to be risky immediately after graduation to create your own company, or to make your startup. ‚Äù <br><br>  So, society is changing, the main activity of humanity is changing.  For the production of information products, know-how, does not require a huge concentration of capital.  One good friend of mine once joked: "if you don‚Äôt know how to make money, go get a job."  In every joke there is some truth, as is known. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/47357/">https://habr.com/ru/post/47357/</a></p>
