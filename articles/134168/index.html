  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Public election control using cloud IT</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The last election left a rather eerie impression - massive substitution of results at the level of election commissions (http://cifidiol.livejournal.com/1600.html, and many other links) <br>  Hoping that the situation will somehow be corrected by the powers that be is rather stupid - about such people, my grandmother says ‚ÄúSay in your eyes, they will say - God's dew‚Äù. <br>  It‚Äôs also embarrassing to do nothing, but it‚Äôs a shame to go to rallies and get a rifle butt from the military, who very well raised wages by 2-3 times - I personally don‚Äôt allow responsibility to my family and my future. <br>  In this regard, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãcreating a resource that would control the will of specific people.  Each voter, if he is not afraid to openly declare his civic position, at the moment before sending the ballot to the ballot box, takes a picture of his ballot along with the opened passport, and sends the data to the server ‚Äî via a mobile application or via upload, indicating the number of the polling station, voting time maybe some more data. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Servers, the EC, are located abroad (it makes sense to rent a couple of tens of thousands of cloud instances in Amazon and other clouds for this, since the one-day load will be). <br>  Then the data is grouped and the results in the form of reports are laid out for all to see, with the ability to view each specific newsletter.  Passports scans, if necessary, should be ‚Äúzamyleny‚Äù - except for the photo and the first name, and full access to reading should be provided only to the CEC, observers and law enforcement agencies. <br>  If we assume that 10% of voters will agree to disclose data about themselves, then we get a good representative sample.  And in large and politically active regions, it is even possible to close to full coverage. <br>  Funding for the event should not be so hot, fiction is to process 15-20 million images there.  I think that the right companies, if not from Russia, then from abroad, will provide the necessary discriminating software for free, and if they don‚Äôt provide it, the rent for 1 day is not so wasteful as to collect the amount ‚Äúin the header‚Äù.  Source codes of the system must be put in open access under the GPL (by the way, it would be interesting to see the GUS-Elections). <br><br>  Technologically, the system will be very interesting, an excellent example of mass parallelism. <br>  The server part is the recognition of the image, compressing it for further use and recording the recognized results in the database.  Then, summarizing the results in some NoSQL with the simplest grouping.  The final data array (without images) will represent only a couple of tens of millions of rows that can be grouped on any desktop with two simplest SQL queries and get the election results. <br>  We also need mobile apps for uploading photos for Android, iPhone, WP7, Bada, plus a site with the ability to load normally (if the portal has to be a farm spreading requests over available instances) and a ‚Äúthermometer‚Äù for download progress. <br>  Well, you also need advertising. <br>  Of course, this will not save Russia from the newly created dictatorship, and if tanks arrive, the Internet will be disconnected and all this will lose its meaning.  But it will be another country in which it will be necessary to act differently ... <br>  In my opinion, the elections on December 4 are obviously lost from that on.  information integrity, but we have another election in March, and such a control system will be useful simply to accurately reflect the real support of the people of our government. <br>  Well, not in March, so after 5 years, we are in no hurry, are we?  :) <br></div>
