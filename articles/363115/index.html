The reason for this is a mixture of truth and untruth. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>Section <i>"For the health of the back first swimming is useful"</i></b> <br><blockquote>  Therefore, the main tool in rehabilitation is not a pool at all, but exercises such as squats, bends, various pressures and presses for the upper shoulder girdle, strengthening the muscles of the body, eliminating imbalances in strength and mobility of various muscle groups.  Here they are primarily useful for the health of the back as a preventive tool. </blockquote><br>  If a person has a sore back (displacement of the intervertebral disk, spinal spine), then the least need to squat, because  the spine from this only shrinks, and not strengthened, deformed in such a way that, in the end, only exacerbates the situation.  It is good that even the deadlift or the inclination was not advised. <br><br>  Swimming, like vertical thrust to the chest, hyperextension, pulling up (with the correct technique, of course) stretches the spine, helps it to relax.  There is even a ‚Äústretch‚Äù medical procedure that does the same thing, but a little more effectively under the supervision of doctors (it is often used for problems with the intervertebral disk). <br><br>  In general, if the problem with the back, then contact your neurologist.

      <b>Section <i>"Fractional nutrition supposedly helps to lose weight"</i></b> <br><br>  Again, true with lies.  Fractional nutrition will help to lose weight, but this is just a part of what you need to use to bring yourself into shape. <br><br>  How, strictly speaking, can help split meals? <br>  <b>Firstly</b> , it allows you to keep your appetite under control, calming him down, warning against obzhiralovki everything and everyone (and at night, too, do not forget). <br>  <b>Secondly</b> , in a certain time the body can absorb, i.e.  set to process a certain amount of food.  When an excess occurs, it is stored, i.e.  is deposited in the form of adipose tissue (+ from the part the body gets rid of). <br><br>  <b>The section <i>"You must drink a lot, the norm - 8 glasses of water a day, and drinks with caffeine are deducted"</i></b> <br><br>  Yes, you need to drink a lot, but not in the way you think.  Phrase <blockquote>  And if I eat 2 kilos of vegetables and fruits a day, and so I visit the toilet often enough, another 2 liters on top? </blockquote>  talks about ignorance of basic things.  For example, that vegetables themselves are often 70 percent or more of water. <br><br>  The calculation of the amount of water consumed should be counted on the weight, but excluding the fat layer, and not weight in general.  If you are thin, then on your weight as a whole, if you are obese, then it is somewhat less than is customary (according to formulas). <br><br>  <b>Results</b> <br>  If you decide to put yourself in shape, then: <br><ul><li>  <i>Any information worth checking-recheck.</i>  It is not necessary to find out the answers to the questions raised in this post somewhere on the forums or on the Internet in general from impersonal people who they wouldn‚Äôt introduce themselves (yes, yes, and I shouldn‚Äôt trust it either, since it went that way); </li><li>  <i>Sports magazines also often carry rubbish.</i>  Just look at how the bulk of the staff of these magazines looks and you will be convinced of this; </li><li>  <i>If you have nutritional problems, go to a nutritionist.</i>  And it does not matter if you want to gain weight or lose weight; </li><li>  <i>If there are problems with the body, then go with both the family doctor and the sports doctor.</i>  And it does not matter whether you are going to the gym or not. </li><li>  <i>It just doesn't happen.</i>  If everything was simple, then everyone would be healthy and beautiful, but alas.  So do not be lazy and be prepared to spend enough time. </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Sources</b> <br><ul><li>  Seluyanov - "Technology of improving physical culture" </li><li>  Video lectures of Dr. Seluyanov </li><li>  Arnold Schwarzenegger - "Bodybuilding Encyclopedia" </li><li>  Faleev - "Secrets of strength training" </li><li>  Youtube channels and books by Denis Seminikhin </li><li>  Youtube channel YouGiftedRussia </li><li>  Youtube channel of Denis Borisov </li></ul><br>  <i>* Cited those sources that are easiest to find on the Internet.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/363115/">https://habr.com/ru/post/363115/</a></p>
