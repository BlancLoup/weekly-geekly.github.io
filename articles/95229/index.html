  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Effective team building</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The weather in the yard is excellent, and those unfortunate people who have not managed to fall on vacation for the whole summer think about how to combine business with pleasure and work and relax.  And I remember the ‚Äúbright idea‚Äù - but not whether to hold teambuilding, corporate events, an anniversary (underline the necessary)?  Unfortunately, in my experience of participating in similar events in a variety of companies - this is not always the bright idea leads to the planned results.  How to do everything right? <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  1) Let's start with the goal of the event.  Team building is therefore ‚Äúteam building‚Äù, not ‚Äúcorporate‚Äù, which is intended to strengthen the corporate spirit of cooperation, and not to save money by drinking alcohol collectively.  Some mandatory team building rules -

      <br>
      - Only employees, without clients and partners.  In especially rare and often unsuccessful cases - employees with families <br><br>  - Change of roles.  Chiefs - obey, teams are led by line employees - a great opportunity to try yourself in new quality <br><br>  - An open and friendly atmosphere, the removal of administrative barriers to communication <br><br>  - A lot of activities designed to meet employees from different cities, departments, etc. <br><br>  2) Some "know-how" <br><br>  - want to do team building of your department, department, etc.  bright and memorable?  Think up the name and give the status of an annual event (T-shirt printing with the name of the event and the year, for example, will help).  And while the rest of the departments will leave for Bukhalovo, you will leave for the Annual Congress of IT specialists for Horn and Hoof to exchange experience in a relaxed atmosphere.  It helps when agreeing budget action. <br><br>  - If you conduct a timbild for adequate people, paintballs that have already been consumed, and other ‚Äútype of pontovy‚Äù attributes, think boldly.  There are options for sports recreation (do not forget to specify only the training and health of all potential participants) or projects in the form of, for example, social assistance. <br><br>  It is much more effective.  The same paintball is not so scary that it is "a safe form to instruct bruises to the boss."  It is much worse that he is little meant to coordinate the work and form the team spirit (at least in the amateur version).  Most of the employees do not even recognize friends under the masks, not to mention the team game, etc.  Plus, as in the "tug of war" - a very strange feeling at the end.  Puffed, laid out, sweated ... and the result is an absolute zero.  Is that bruises count. <br><br>  What could be sports projects? <br><br>  - Rest with tents.  Nature, silence, unusual tasks of cooking, making fire, shelter from the rain, orientation to the terrain.  For urban residents, some new challenges that are better dealt with jointly. <br><br>  - Sports rafting.  Great photos, rowing, trying not to flip the raft, etc.  Very memorable. <br><br>  - Mini Olympics.  (Microsoft, for example, conducted the Micro Olympic Games).  Various relay races and contests.  Less risks, easier preparation, although of course, and less spectacular. <br><br>  What is social timbild? <br><br>  When we planned watched the following options: <br><br>  1) Distribution of products and social assistance to people with disabilities in Moscow.  (same "Watch", only with benefit) <br><br>  2) Clearing debris from natural water bodies (with proper equipment, a status and safe occupation is enough) <br><br>  3) Assistance in conducting summer phys-mat camps (we do this regularly on a regular basis, but it‚Äôs difficult to get 40-60 people to work at once) <br><br>  The best part was the collection of two computer classes for the boarding school for visually impaired children.  40 people in three days painted batteries, conducted electricity and a local network, set up computers (just our old equipment came in handy), trained teachers, launched a school portal ( <a href="http://www.way2future.ru/default.aspx">www.way2future.ru</a> ), held a holiday for children.  Terribly interesting project on its organization, conduct, communication in the process and the results achieved.  All participants were satisfied.  A landmark campaign for the company, there is something to remember and a full set of team-building attributes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/492/43d/a26/49243da269980ecafd33b6923cecf0ab.jpg" alt="image"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/megamozg/post_images/3b9/b6f/027/3b9b6f02739dfd20ce354f3a22869048.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  I heard about similar projects when, for example, avant-garde statues for small cities were collected from piles of collected garbage, etc.  There is plenty of room for fantasy. <br><br>  And, finally, as a joke - one of the team building that I remembered very well began very normally.  A trip to the cottage small company.  The reasons for the success are unknown - not the wrongly picked homemade mushrooms, not the crab sticks ... The bottom line is the cruellest "weakness of the stomach" of all participants and the attendant effects.  It's far from Moscow, it's not so bad to call an ambulance, etc.  Unfavorable details omitted.  The dry residue is that the participants have absolutely no ‚Äúbarriers in communication‚Äù with each other.  Ponder - "absolutely no."  Any working question can now be discussed quickly, without too much polite and intro, what impression you will make is absolutely not important anymore.  Attention!  This is not a recommendation to repeat this random experience, just an illustration of the fact that ‚Äúdifficulties unite‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/95229/">https://habr.com/ru/post/95229/</a></p>
