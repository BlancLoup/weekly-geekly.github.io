Even before almost 7 years in eBay and PayPal, as well as about 8 years in the Department of Justice.  During his career, Sullivan participated in the investigation of a number of high-profile cybercrimes.  In 2002, he prosecuted Cisco Systems accountants for illegally issuing almost $ 8 million in Cisco shares. <br><br>  While working at eBay, between 2002 and 2006, Joe had a record track record of capturing the ‚Äúbad guys‚Äù. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote><h4>  Travis Kalanik: </h4><br>  Uber makes about a million trips per day in 300 cities in 56 countries.  In this connection, the scale and complexity of our work has increased significantly.  Permanently growing infrastructure in which substantial funds have been invested requires enhanced security measures.  An important part of this effort was a careful approach to selecting a strong leadership team.  We were looking for the right person for us to control the global security aspects, understanding the uniqueness of our brainchild.

      Seeing the Uber logo in their phone, many will think of us as a simple application.  But in many ways we have become an important part of the infrastructure of cities.  We are both in cyberspace and on city streets;  we are the bridge between bits and atoms.  Despite the milestones of tens of millions of trips per week, we still have the daunting task of improving the world, and this is completely true when it comes to data security and security in general. <br><br>  In search of a better candidate for this post, we could not find anyone better than Joe Sullivan, who will join the team in late April.  We look forward to working together to make Uber even better. <br></blockquote><br><br><blockquote><h4>  Joe Sullivan: </h4><br>  I am delighted with the mission of Uber in this transport revolution, and as Travis and the rest of the team, I firmly believe that the safety of the highest class is crucial for the fulfillment of this mission.  I managed to work in two amazing companies at the moments of their lightning growth - eBay and Facebook.  I look forward to applying my best practical skills so that Uber can easily bridge the gap between the digital and physical worlds as easily as possible.  Today, the company already has an excellent foundation for this, and my goal is to develop and improve it in order to make Uber more powerful. <br><br>  Leaving Facebook was not an easy decision, but I could not miss such a chance.  Participating in the construction of a young and growing company is worth a lot.  Where else in Silicon Valley could I get the opportunity to apply such specific skills to create a product that directly affects society every day in many cities of the world? </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/289220/">https://habr.com/ru/post/289220/</a></p>
