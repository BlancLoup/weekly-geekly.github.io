Unfortunately, my little experience of writing reviews about the work of enterprises suggests that it is better not to ‚Äúshine‚Äù on some.  On the one hand, they begin to fuss, glad that they were noticed.  And on the other - to make a hurt look.  I do not need it, read offensive comments that may appear.  Therefore, the only thing I will indicate about the defendants is that the article compares a large US firm and a large enterprise owned by a large, one might even say, a state corporation in Ukraine.  The enterprises have large turnovers, the number of employees is similar, the number of employees tied to my system is relatively similar, about ten.  I work with them not the first day, I did more than one project. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  For a start, I will outline a few tasks that I solved "here" and "there".

      <strong>Problem</strong> <strong>statement</strong> <br><br>  "The Task Here": The system of customer accounting and shipment of goods.  The system of accounting for the return of documents actually.  Integration with the central base of the corporation, lying on the Internet and having no ‚Äúends‚Äù for connection <br><br>  ‚ÄúTask There‚Äù: A system for accounting customers and issuing proposals to them.  In fact, it is a PDF document generator with the ability to count various configurations, etc. of things. <br><br>  In both cases, I personally programmed, the programming style was used ‚Äúfrom scratch‚Äù, the tool was LAMP / FAR / Chrome.  The development was carried out almost in parallel, except that the ‚Äúthere‚Äù system, in the volume of the entire task, was slightly larger. <br><br>  So, it all started with a task.  I will tell you a little how it was done ‚Äúhere‚Äù and ‚Äúthere‚Äù.  I need the task, since I am very busy, and just like that, I cannot do a working system on my knee.  It will be unclear what. <br><br>  <strong>Job preparation</strong> <br><ul><li>  There, at the level of the project developer, a PDF document was created (by the prof. Designer), in two or three versions, as well as a presentation document for the client.  After all this was settled, I was given a ready PDF and asked about the deadlines and my comments.  I, somewhere within 2-3 days, wrote all the questions about things that seemed incomprehensible to me, clarified the terms of the project.  All approved in a couple of days. </li><li>  Here, in a personal conversation, I was told that there was a problem in enterprise X.  They need to print pieces of paper that are glued to the boxes with the goods.  And they, because of the ugly laziness and stupidity of the workers, cannot do this in Excel, and therefore suffer.  Yes, the customer base is in this very "Excel".  Thousand so on 7 records.  And they, all the data there en masse, but how to make a page for printing, or God forbid - a macro, they don‚Äôt guess. As a result, I put on, ‚Äútest‚Äù, the system for printing this case, to import data from Excel, and to generate pdf, everything is online on your hosting.  Further, the people "potsykal" in this thing, it turned out that it is efficient and convenient.  Next, we sat down with a cava with a friend who works at this enterprise, and formed a task, it took about 2-3 hours. </li></ul><br>  I do not know about you, but what I came across here, from the client companies, almost never knew how to do the task.  That is, in general - I have never met a normal task.  Idiocy, it seems, to make it very good and already - and give 50% of the rollback - it was like that.  But I, like the last fool, do not participate in this.  A matter of principle.  And I have much more development experience than several years, which are sufficient in the opinion of the management of some large companies, to work as the head of IT departments.  Many times more.  Almost an order of magnitude more. <br><br>  <strong>Hosting Providers</strong> <br><br>  It is clear that if I develop a web system, I need a hosting provider.  Here I can honestly and boldly call who used and their advantages and disadvantages <br><ul><li>  "Provider there" - rakspase, hosting plan like "pc sites" is called, did not have access to the panel (could get on first request) </li><li>  ‚ÄúThe provider is here‚Äù is a world host, I don‚Äôt know which hosting plan, I didn‚Äôt have access to the panel (I couldn‚Äôt get it, they‚Äôve activated each login into the panel from a mobile, and the phone number is not mine) </li></ul><br>  In terms of connection speed, ‚ÄúMirokhost‚Äù suited me much more.  According to my subjective feelings, he was ten times faster than a similar foreign Rackspace.  I‚Äôll clarify that I‚Äôm most excited about copying FTP.  Mirokhost does not allow long pauses between sessions of receiving or sending files.  However, in terms of work, all this speed was overshadowed by the client's system administrator, who was never able to connect the cron job.  As a result, I was forced to make its execution remote, from my hosting, on which I added everything I needed. <br><br>  On rakspeysa, kroner the client set the task, but from him, something did not come out, he gave me tips and I edited it myself, it took five minutes.  Here, - the administrator could not install the cron-task for more than a month.  In the end, I'd rather work with slow Rackspace there than with a fast host host here. <br><br>  <strong>Development progress, communication with the customer</strong> <br><ul><li>  Customer "there" - everyday reports, and just chatting on Skype - was the norm.  And we talked for many hours, sometimes.  I‚Äôm guilty of my English, which I improve only in communication, I don‚Äôt want to learn.  All the nuances were adjusted so that it was already fun and interesting at the end - when this whole thing is over.  The customer was interested in every little thing and helped in every task I asked to do.  That is, you must enter the data, please, we are already doing; </li><li>  The customer is ‚Äúhere‚Äù - well, let's say, the first two weeks I made one form, asked her to fill out.  Filled two more weeks.  The department, - seven people, just stupidly sat and did nothing in this regard.  Then another two weeks spat at the ceiling, because I slowly made interfaces.  Then the customer asked when, and I finished the whole system over the weekend.  After that, about two weeks - again his team was raped.  He even made a ‚Äúbug‚Äù for them to write what was wrong.  For the first day they wrote something there, for the second they wrote it, and that‚Äôs all.  I solved the whole thing instantly.  After that - about 15 days passed.  Work in the system is not conducted at all - for about a week.  Not interesting apparently.  At the same time, I know for sure that the customer has a problem - with the data that this system could give. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Design Support</strong> <br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúThere‚Äù is a designer attached to a project who, if necessary, rules with my words, knew my system; </li><li>  "There" - there is no designer, I am a designer, I am a programmer, in general no interface design issues were raised. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Subsequent projects.</strong>  <strong>Quality.</strong> <br><br>  Well, you understand, all the work of a freelancer is based on the fact that clients must lead clients.  That is, "freebie", in terms of quality is not acceptable.  And if the client said something, you need to make it run and already. <br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúThere‚Äù - quality control was carried out by another leading programmer of my level, suggested a couple of nuances, I corrected - I took away the Indian code, took the empty templates, made a garbage collector for the files.  In the end, all very nice work.  Code trash - minimum; </li><li>  ‚ÄúHere‚Äù - nobody cares at all, no one has any questions about how and what has been done inside.  I collected the Indian code on my own initiative.  The garbage collector is generally difficult, the Cyrillic in the file names.  Well, there is no such volume. </li></ul><br>  <strong>Control of performers</strong> <br><ul><li>  ‚ÄúThere‚Äù is a logging system, I did about a year after the start of development, to catch the ‚Äúglitches‚Äù. </li><li>  ‚ÄúHere‚Äù - before the start of work it was agreed to make a full logging system in order to control the actions of users.  There was a suspicion about the fact that they might be dirty (!). </li></ul><br>  <strong>In the end</strong> <br><br>  I do not want to offend anyone.  They say "there" is better.  ‚ÄúHere‚Äù is worse.  Nothing like that!  I work better - here, with fast hosting, with a Russian-speaking client, with whom we went to the brandy more than once, and I know more than one day.  But life disposes - otherwise.  And I understand that I have to choose, far, but more stable. <br><br>  Where would I like to work next time?  Of course with a foreign customer.  He is usually not ashamed to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù for what he has done.  And sometimes I was asked a question - it would be nice to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù for this part of the project, and not bad - for that.  At "us", although the customer and a good friend, but he paid for the system.  as far as I understand it myself, of course, this did not add to his enthusiasm.  The higher authorities, simply scored on a working tool, and forced users to keep records further in Excel.  In which 10+ thousand lines and which on my eight-core opens up to 30 seconds of time. <br><br>  PS  Here are a <a href="http://publikz.com/blog_7809">couple of</a> words about the system made "here."  A few screenshots to even understand what is at stake.  I did not write about the ‚Äútheirs‚Äù system, we rule it and rule, and there is not much time.  I hope that someday I will add a few words about her too.  But, in general, it is not much different. <br><br>  In general, it‚Äôs very interesting how the habr community works out here / there.  In order to somehow understand it, realize and correct my methods and write it all. <br><br>  <i>update1,2,3: I want to say thank you to the users of ‚ÄúHabra‚Äù under the name Goder, side2k, mytribune, who have spent the time to fix my grammatical errors.</i> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158511/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158511/</a></p>
