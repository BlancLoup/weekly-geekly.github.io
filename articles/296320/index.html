One of the most reputable Malaysian investment companies has become interested in a young Ukrainian online platform and is considering it for investment.  However, in the process of negotiations with the founder of the startup <i>Andrei Prudko</i> , the main requirement of the investor was voiced - for the possibility of financial investments in an international project, the entire team should be relocated to Poland. <br><br>  The international freelancing platform for translators, copywriters, and foreign language tutors fought for their place in the sun among 50 startups from all over Europe.  After a 10-minute pitch on the stage of the Prague conference, teams of participants were aimed at making new acquaintances, finding an influential mentor in the person of representatives of large Western organizations, or attracting solid investments.  The teams searched from 10 thousand dollars to fill the site to 300 million euros to create a test plant for the production of structures for bridges.

      An important factor that caused the interest of the investment company to the <i>Polyglot</i> project was the growing market of linguistic services, on which the young marketplays are oriented. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/8f0/8de/56b/8f08de56b2bb46beaa9ba6ef418c4878.jpg"><br><br>  According to the independent American research company <i>‚ÄúCommon Sense Advisory‚Äù</i> , in 2014 only 73 billion dollars were spent on the services of translators and tutors of foreign languages ‚Äã‚Äãcompared to 34 billion dollars in 2013, where the share of translations alone accounted for 15% of the total of the market.  Moreover, by 2020, the research agency predicts an increase in the number of translation specialists by 42%, which in 2014 amounted to more than 1.5 million people.  And according to <i>EdNET Insight</i> , the market for e-learning (online learning) by 2017 will be about 198 billion dollars. <br><br>  Over the past two years, many Ukrainian startups, having received investments, transfer their main office abroad and move there with the whole team.  So Odessa-based mobile application developers <i>Looksery</i> made a deal worth about $ 150 million and left for the United States to continue working on the product, the Dnepropetrovsk IT company <i>908</i> went to Poland, and in May, <i>Luxoft</i> , in May of last year, said they would transport about 500 programmers from Ukraine to Romania and Poland.  So in the case of <i>Polyglot</i> startup, a foreign investment company considers the possibility of cooperation only if they leave for the territory of a neighboring western state, justifying it by the unstable economic and political situation in the country.  Unfortunately, foreign investors are afraid to invest in Ukrainian projects and teams precisely because of the difficult situation in the state.  For some, this is such an important factor that they make it critical and obligatory. <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúNegotiations are at the stage of discussing the terms of cooperation and moving to Poland will lead to much higher costs for maintaining the team than it was in Ukraine due to the difference in rental costs, legal red tape and other expenses.  But if relocation still remains a prerequisite for receiving investment, then such a step is possible. ‚Äù </blockquote>  - says the founder of the linguistic freelance platform <i>Andrei Prudko</i> . <br><br>  The principle of working with the <i>Polyglot</i> platform is that the customer who needs to perform a task related to the language sphere (translation of the text, writing articles in any language, choosing a foreign language tutor or guide for a tour anywhere in the world) <a href="https://2polyglot.com/ru/projects/publish">places an order on the 2polyglot website .com</a> , and freelancers interested in ordering apply for its implementation.  The customer can choose a freelancer based on the rating of the contractor, his portfolio, the availability of appropriate certificates and the specified cost.  Payment for work is made after proper execution on time with the option ‚ÄúSafe transaction‚Äù. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296320/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296320/</a></p>
