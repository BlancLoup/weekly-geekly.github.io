This time it's not about the MWC-2016 smartphone-tablet updates and not about ultrabooks.  Speech about them - our girls, girls, women.  In the previous series of festive excitement at Geektimes, everyone feverishly searched for gifts for geeks, men, IT people, and lamented that there was no matter more complicated and ungrateful.  We picked up sales catalogs for March 8 and thought: what do you know about the difficulties of choosing a gift ... You can't get away with the Raspberry Pi.  Here you have to think with your heart. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/gearbest/blog/272064/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/875/c03/5e3/875c035e32e049cb92a06197cbd72ee0.jpg"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Gearbest is blamed for the fact that special discounts and sales start shortly before the holiday and many products simply do not have time to get to your home.  Our logic is simple - we give discounts, and you choose the gifts yourself.  However, we have attended to your questions and collected cool ideas for a ‚Äúdeferred‚Äù gift: <br><br><ul><li>  issue a comic certificate for receiving a gift and put it in a bouquet / chocolate; <br></li><li>  place coupons for kisses, cleaning, trips to the shopping center and a coupon for a gift including - it will be nice to find it in a pack; <br></li><li>  choose a gift together - then it will be exactly the most desirable. <br></li></ul><br>  All offers for the holiday can be viewed on a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/promotion-8-special-433.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">special page</a> .  In the post, we have included options for real gadzhetomanok and girls with an excellent sense of humor.  We share the findings.

    <h2>  Most Popular and Expected </h2><br>  If we talk about the way to quickly, but quite expensive, get out with a gift not previously purchased by March 8, then the output is the new <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/cell-phones/pp_294069.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">flagship of the XIAOMI Mi5</a> .  Its sales will start in China on March 1, pre-order is still open for Russia.

By weight, he will add another 475 grams, but still the kit is easy and convenient. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98f/c24/702/98fc24702643436f9b0b26a3e66fd923.png"><br><br>  But if you already have a smartphone ... Girls love selfies: self-portraits, with friends, with animals, with monuments.  And it's great - after all, it is a selfie that shows how a person represents himself.  Yes, and fool around in the free moment is also very good.  Front cameras of smartphones fail less and less, but the light and facial expression continue to play evil jokes.  All problems will be solved at once by a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/iphone-selfie-monopod/pp_305499.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">monopod with a lamp</a> and a mirror - you can add light and get ready for shooting.  The handle extends up to 86 cm - in combination with the length of the hand, this will allow you to remove a fairly large space.  At this miracle of versatility does not end - for those who are fond of filming the party so that there is no charge left for the beloved people, a small power bank of 3200 mAh is built into the monopod handle.  Enough energy for everything. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c66/43c/e5f/c6643ce5fb3647a6a1ec4abc5bf8f9e3.jpg"></div><br>  If someone turned out to have little energy or potential recipients of both a smartphone and a tablet, then <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/iphone-power-bank/pp_227728.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi‚Äôs power bank</a> will save 10,000 mAh.

In fact, this is the second e-ink display for iPhone.  The desired content is transmitted to the second screen via Bluetooth.  The case has a built-in 460 mAh battery, which is enough for him for a long battery life. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b2c/220/cc1/b2c220cc1497449392424bed0fbda4ce.jpg"></div><br><h2>  For the curious </h2><br>  Why would a girl <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers-3d-printer-kits/pp_236738.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">handle a 3D printer</a> ?  First of all, for fun: you can make fun decorations for a theme party, souvenir magnets or crafts in a kindergarten for a child.  For modeling and design of prototypes of small things: jewelry, demonstration materials, etc.  Finally, this is a good opportunity to arouse interest in 3D printing, if you yourself need a serious printer, and your home budget refuses to accept such an expense.  Printer pen will interest any girl: from 7 to 70 years.  8 print speeds, the ability to draw on the surface and in the air, lightness and safety will appeal to all.  In addition, this handle is easy to pick up consumables - it uses PLA-threads.  By the way, do not forget <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/3d-printers/pp_174063.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">to stock them</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/39e/cb6/d00/39ecb6d00c6a41cabb1eb2c10e76bf89.png"><br><br><h2>  For sports and enthusiastic </h2><br>  Admit it, the girl on the treadmill or jogging in the park is a beautiful sight, and it is doubly beautiful, it‚Äôs your girlfriend who takes care of herself and does her health.  And impressive, fascinating, amazing.  But behind this spectacle there is a huge work, which is facilitated by pleasant and necessary trifles: a comfortable hat, excellent driving music and, of course, a fixed result that stimulates in itself, and is also the reason for the posts causing social envy in social networks. <br><br>  The reasons for pride will securely fix the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-wristband/pp_263275.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">Xiaomi Mi Band 1S</a> fitness bracelet, compatible with iOS 7.0, Android 4.4 and higher.  The tracker tracks various types of activity, records and displays the number of steps, distance covered, calories burned.  Achieving sporting goals with it is both easier and more fun.  Together with the pedometer, you can order pleasant and useful trifles: pleasant to the touch, colored rubber <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/watch-accessaries/pp_187711.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">bracelets</a> and a stylish <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-watches/pp_197102.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">leather bracelet</a> with a classic watch buckle.  It does not only look strictly, but it will never be lost (alas, this happens with trackers) due to a reliable attachment on the arm.  For fans of the metal strap there is a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/watch-accessories/pp_312025.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">silver version of the bracelet</a> with a classic watch clasp. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/7a0/237/96b/7a023796b5cb4599ab384fbb2d584064.png"><br><br>  When you run, the most inconvenient is the departing and flying headphones, which need to be corrected every now and then, even if they are equipped with comfortable (actually, not always) ear hooks.  Do not be distracted from classes and continue to listen to energetic music, using the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/home-gadgets/pp_113673.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">bandana-headphones</a> with switch buttons and compatible in addition to all devices with Bluetooth from iPhone 6, 6 Plus, 5S, 5C, 5, 4S, 4. With its help you can receive calls.  The device works continuously for 60 hours without recharging. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/06c/7f4/a13/06c7f4a13c634c5bad58c96981df5bef.jpg"></div><br><h2>  For those at risk of cooking what you risk eating </h2><br>  Modern girls have long ceased to be associated with the kitchen, but nevertheless, many of them love to cook, experimenting with new recipes found on the Internet.  To get the dish right the first time with a bang, you need to carefully keep the proportions.  Measurements in spoons and glasses are an eternal problem.  Therefore, kitchen scales will become a truly necessary kitchen gadget.  Specifically, <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/kitchen-dining/pp_241803.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">this model</a> can accurately weigh products from 1 gram to 5 kg, has a digital display, is equipped with non-slip feet.  For the measurement of liquids, flowability and stickiness, a taring function is provided - pre-weighing the container and zeroing over it.  Scales are thin, light, they can be cleaned with a damp cloth. <br><br>  For smaller measurements (salt, herbal tea, spices) there are convenient <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/home-gadgets/pp_191581.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">spoon scales</a> , weighing products from 0.1 grams to 0.5 kg.  By the way, these scales are solar-powered. <br><br>  Another incredibly necessary thing, which, in fact, is useful to tea lovers of any gender, is a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/temperature-instruments/pp_288739.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">digital kitchen thermometer</a> , measuring in the range from -50 to +300 degrees.  After all, to reveal the taste and properties of different tea, different temperatures are needed - from 65 to 95 degrees. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e71/4b3/080/e714b3080f0d4807a31db21bd23783b5.png"><br><br><h2>  No kitchen uniform </h2><br>  In general, girls sometimes have a strange concept of gadgets.  They are sometimes pleased by completely useless things from the point of view of a man.  For example, did you see her with just painted nails?  Helpless creation: no button buttoned, no hair straightened, no car to start.  Perhaps everyone will be pleased with the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/nail-tools/pp_298546.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">LED-dryer for a manicure</a> .  This small piece automatically turns on, reliably dries the nail polish for 30 seconds, protects the eyes from the bright light of the lamp with an ergonomic cover. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bca/470/f59/bca470f591624c4b8b84826dc454ee49.jpg"></div><br>  Speaking of gifts <s>for bullying a cat</s> for home and comfort, you can not ignore the <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/smart-home/pp_187246.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">robot vacuum cleaner</a> .  He travels around the apartment, collects dust, is controlled by the remote.  Of course, 22 watts and 0.3 l are not the power and capacity that will help to suck everything in during the general cleaning, but for daily cleaning of dust - that is necessary.  By the way, the vacuum cleaner has a "sense of edge", so you can send it to collect deposits of dust on the surface of the mezzanine, cabinets and the rest of the upper part, where your hands rarely reach out.  Specifically, this model is also quiet, only 50 dB, it will not even wake the child. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/237/06f/005/23706f0058d0411b918bb2a67b8248ae.jpg"></div><br>  Speaking of children.  If your family has recently become bigger and more suspiciously noisy, or it will happen very soon, a high-resolution <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/ip-cameras/pp_21407.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">baby monitor</a> , sound transmission and a night-vision camera (up to 7 m) will be an excellent <s>soothing</s> gift.  The level of the wireless signal from -85dBm, so that the reliability of the transfer of adventure from the nursery should not worry. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5fe/863/7be/5fe8637be67e4ae9b32f82870398e6f8.jpg"></div><br><h2>  Just for fun </h2><br>  Well, if you have older children in your house, then a <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/other-classic-toys/pp_271474.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">puzzle</a> of 432 magnetic balls is suitable for your home and office.  In real children, it develops fine motor skills and logic, while older children protect their nerves, distracting them from office life and nerve negotiations. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d20/f73/9b6/d20f739b61b140f080023d5c5c2b981d.jpg"></div><br>  Do not think, we have not gone crazy, offering readers Geektimes <a href="http://www.gearbest.com/action-toys/pp_124439.html%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes%26utm_medium%3Dyulia%26utm_campaign%3Dg16">plush ducks</a> .
