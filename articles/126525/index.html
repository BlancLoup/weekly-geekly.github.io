This will be true for any version. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h4>  Ticket </h4><br><br><img src="http://gregor.ru/files/illustrations/ss_cb_01.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Firstly, there are three types of tickets: error (bug), enhancement (enhancement) and task (task).  By the way, the default is usually a bug, be careful. 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      We have a special attitude only to ticket improvements.  Now they are most often used only to discuss some suggestions and experiments.  Then we close the enhancement and open the task, if it is decided to do what was discussed. <br><br><img src="http://gregor.ru/files/illustrations/ss_cb_02.png" alt="image"><br><br>  Any ticket has five statuses (this can be customized).  And this is where the fun begins.  We adopted several simple rules for ourselves, which greatly simplified the understanding of the state of the ticket: <br><br>  <b>New</b> - the ticket is still being discussed and the decision about working on it has not yet been made.  For example, information is collected on a ticket, implementation is being discussed (in the fourth version of KodBase, by the way, some convenient discussions were made) or it is not clear to which version of the product this will be done. <br><br>  <b>Accepted</b> - a ticket, the discussion on which is completed and all the data necessary for the implementation is already ready, but the work has not yet begun.  When one of us is looking for the next task, they look at such tickets. <br><br>  <b>In progress</b> - obviously, tickets for which work is being done.  They always have a performer.  If the performer is not yet assigned in the accepted ticket, then the taker indicates in this field himself. <br><br>  <b>Completed</b> - a ticket, all the conditions of which are realized.  We can rediscover the ticket if the problem is solved only in the opinion of the performer (for example, a tester can do it).  Then the ticket is transferred to the status of <b>New</b> , as there is something to discuss. <br><br>  <b>Invald</b> is a ticket that closes for any reason other than the implementation of the task.  We decided not to do it, it is impossible to reproduce the bug or simply mistakenly created ticket. <br><br><h4>  The milestone </h4><br>  If the ticket is tied to Mylston, then it must be finished by Milestone's deadline and not later.  But what is the difference between us and traditional approaches is how we feel about the absence of a deadline from a ticket.  In this case, we believe that the ticket should be closed "as soon as possible" and not "at any time." <br><br>  That's all our simple methodology, the performance of which we have been proving for about a year and a half by the fact that no one has any questions and wants to change nothing. <br><br>  If you have questions about Codebase, ask, I will answer them with pleasure (no, they don‚Äôt pay me, but quite the opposite. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/126525/">https://habr.com/ru/post/126525/</a></p>
