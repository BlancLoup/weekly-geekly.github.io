  <section class="page js-page"><h1>ICO Telegram received applications for $ 3.8 billion</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/42c/22b/57b/42c22b57be44310428d623625543c571.png"><br><br>  January 18 at Geektimes <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/297347/">there was</a> information that Telegram, the company of Pavel Durov, plans to collect during the ICO not $ 600 million, as previously planned, but more than a billion US dollars.  It is interesting that initially information about the Telegram of the initial tokens placement appeared on the network almost by accident - it was distributed by Anton Rosenberg, who <a href="https://geektimes.ru/post/294711/">had previously clashed</a> with the Durovs. <br><br>  After this news was published, investment specialists began to comment on it.  For example, the head of BitBull Capital, Joe Di Pasquale, said that the Telegram project looks risky.  Therefore, the expert considered that the messenger will collect hundreds of millions of dollars in ICO, but there is no need to talk about a billion.  But as it turned out, he was wrong.  This is not about hundreds of millions of US dollars, but about billions. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Today it became known that the collection of applications for the preliminary stage of the ICO has been completed, <a href="https://www.vedomosti.ru/technology/articles/2018/01/22/748482-telegram-zayavok">as reported by</a> participants in the investment market who are close to the Telegram project.  According to them, the demand is simply hype.  Thus, at the preliminary stage, the company‚Äôs ICO collects $ 850 million, and applications were filed for four times the large amount, which is close to $ 3.8 billion.

      The boom is so great that even now the companies whose applications for investment have not been approved by Telegram are ready to buy out the shares of those companies whose applications have been approved, but at a much higher price.  Let me remind you that the amount below $ 20 million was not considered by the company - those who could not provide a sufficient amount of funds were considered not a very serious partner.  Well, now such ‚Äúsmall‚Äù companies are trying to get their share of the pie and offer to buy out the ‚Äúsecondary‚Äù share 30-40% more than the original amount. <br><br>  Several market participants stated that the approved allocations are already being sold, albeit in secrecy.  Durov already knows about all this, since on Sunday evening he wrote the following on his Twitter: ‚ÄúLet us know if you get offers to buy Grams‚Äù. <br><br>  Market participants were able to report the cost of the token Gram.  Early investors bought tokens at 30 cents, but in the future it is expected to grow from $ 1.45 to $ 3.5.  Unfortunately, it is still unclear the origin of the funds that offer tokens for redemption, as well as the size of their investments.  There is still to fear fraudsters, who often impersonate themselves, if not for representatives of Telegram, then for investors who have received the approval of the company to provide investment. <br><br>  Earlier it was also reported that the book of applications for the preliminary ICO was simply overflowing, so the company‚Äôs management refused a number of investment proposals, including Russian ones.  In many cases, investors filed applications for investing larger amounts than they intended to invest.  This was done in the hope that the organizers would reduce their shares.  And in fact, in many cases it happened.  But the problem is that all payments approved for pre-ICO must be made before February 1. <br><br>  And since far from everyone can pay, some companies offer others to buy out their share.  The company Telegram itself plans to spend the funds on the development of the new blockchain platform Telegram Open Network (TON).  In the future, this system will be able to compete with Visa and Mastercard. <br><br>  Runa Capital senior investment manager Konstantin Vinogradov believes that the resale of the company's tokens is quite a logical move.  After all, they will be more expensive, investors are much more profitable to pay a commission to participants in the preliminary stage.  True, this can go against the rules of the ICO, and the project team will not be happy with this project. <br><br>  An interesting point is that not investors of cryptotechnologies, but traditional investors participate in ICO Telegram, this is what distinguishes the primary sale of Telegram tokens from all others.  Usually, according to the founder of the blockchain platform Mytime (data sale) Edward Gurinovich, cryptoinvestors expect a tenfold annual return on investment.  But traditional investors are quite satisfied with a 100% growth - this is still a return that is impossible in the real sector. <br><br>  Now not too large investors gather in groups, consolidating capital and pooled.  Experts advise to study more information about the project, without investing money until the release of a full-fledged press release. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/374187/">https://habr.com/ru/post/374187/</a></p>
