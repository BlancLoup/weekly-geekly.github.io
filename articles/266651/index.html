Special SIM card and many-many incoming numbers</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Mobile communications are perhaps the most conservative and, paradoxically, the most sedentary industry in the futhering and fluid telecom world.  Over the past 20 years, no revolution has happened in radio communication technologies - SIM cards have remained SIM cards, base stations are base stations, and the GSM standard is the GSM standard.  It is clear that services on mobile devices are migrating in the direction of data transfer and voice services are gradually disappearing into oblivion, driven out by ruthless cannibals - vibers / watsaps.  But after all nobody canceled voice services and is not going to cancel: the customer‚Äôs call is always the customer‚Äôs call, and the number of the advertising phone on the site is a constant attribute of any business. <br><br>  Our company is very respectful of voice services, since we are a telephone operator and our technical specialists have turned gray and have acquired professional diseases precisely in the field of classic telephone services.  Therefore, for a couple of years we have been cherishing and cherishing our special AltegroSIM SIM cards, which have emerged in a stubborn fight against the brutal mobile broadband and have been engaged in the ongoing ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù of classic and mobile telephony services.  One of the testimonies of our heroic struggle is the <a href="http://a-sim.ru/">A-SIM</a> project, which we started writing about in one of the previous hubs. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/fb4/bbe/442/fb4bbe442f644c0393c696a2d01a8e70.jpeg">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br>  Before proceeding to the description of a pair of interesting technological solutions, invented by us on the basis of A-SIM, we briefly recall that in these very special SIM cards there is something interesting and innovative.  If in a nutshell, AltegroSIM SIM cards are a ‚Äúfeet footed‚Äù, i.e., together with one of the mobile operators, we turned a cell phone into a portable office or fixed device (as you prefer): SIM cards understand the protocols Internet telephony without connecting to the Internet, i.e., they work like a normal IP phone with all its attributes ‚Äî logins, passwords, proxies and camp servers, but without any additional mobile applications and other tricks.  I inserted a sim card into an old Nokia and a vulture phone is ready.  Calls from / to SIM cards are transmitted directly to the IP-telephony network and back, which allows you to work communication miracles: assign one or more virtual numbers to SIM cards, change the caller ID at your discretion, fasten multi-level voice greetings, record conversations and watch statistics calls in real time.  One of these ‚Äúmiracles‚Äù, designed not for corporate, but for private clients, we launched not so long ago - mobile Internet telephony service <a href="http://a-fon.ru/">A-FON.RU</a> , in which Internet telephony and mobile communication merged in an unprecedented, convergent, ecstasy . <br><br>  For greater persuasiveness and clarity, we will describe a couple of cases that can be ‚Äúmixed up‚Äù by becoming an A-FON subscriber.  At first glance, A-FON is a regular Internet project for low-cost calls all over the world, there are a lot of similar projects, and if all this were so, we would have dutifully bowed our heads, expecting fierce criticism from respected readers of our blog and an endless number of minuses Habrakarma company Altegro, who dared to write banality in the popular tehnoblog.  But everything is not so, or rather, not quite. <br><br>  <b>See the section A-SIM of our personal account</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ed/3a0/07c/5ed3a007cbb845e2924361252cb40471.jpeg"><br><br>  This is where the goodies begin: you can order a special SIM card and connect it to the Internet telephony service as a regular device (telephone).  Everything, from now on, any call from SIM cards will run through Internet telephony channels with all its features: a call to a friend for Berlin for 2 rubles, per-second tariffing, online details, prizes and gifts from a generous operator, and it all works on an old Nokia.  With outgoing calls sorted out.  And now the most interesting thing: in your personal account you can get a virtual number, the most common one, which now isn‚Äôt selling unless a lazy telephone operator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adf/278/46f/adf27846ff824bc58d83a803abb5e5c3.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Or even connect your own, purchased from another provider</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/adf/278/46f/adf27846ff824bc58d83a803abb5e5c3.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Wizard to configure the virtual number of another provider, requires the most common credentials</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ff9/134/b34/ff9134b3488b43ef9cc1bd3f3163bd9e.jpeg"><br><br>  Typically, incoming calls from Internet telephony providers come to one of the devices ‚Äî an IP phone, gateway, or mobile application.  In our case, calls can be received on the SIM card directly, just like on any of the above devices, no paid redirects, no lost A subscriber numbers, no glitches on the weak Internet (the Internet is simply not needed). <br><br>  Moving on and in practice we consider possible ways of applying mega innovations. <br><br>  <b>Case first</b> <br><br>  <i>Oleg Valerievich, a young man of 30 years old with a tail, has been selling giant ivy bears (bought on Chinese AliExpress) for the last five years through the popular all-Russian website AVITO free ads.</i>  <i>Oleg Valerievich is a lone wolf and he doesn‚Äôt need helpers, he orders bears himself, goes to the post office to get the packages, and he himself answers customer calls.</i>  <i>Oleg Valerievich has a wife and a small child and he simply cannot physically sit on the phone for days.</i>  <i>Therefore, Oleg Valerievich sets up call forwarding from his advertising number to a mobile phone and runs off to the store for diapers.</i>  <i>Incoming from customers are redirected to the cellular and everything seems to be nothing, but it is expensive, and the redirected Internet calls do not provide proper quality.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>In addition, Oleg Valeryevich is thinking about expanding the business and wants to sell bears not only in his native Moscow, but also in Samara, Bryansk and Sevastopol.</i>  <i>For this, he is ready to purchase several virtual numbers in these cities.</i>  <i>And here the most interesting begins: Oleg Valeryevich is by no means a technical specialist, but the only way to steer calls from several phones is to connect numbers to a virtual PBX and create call forwarding rules and call processing scripts in the PBX, which is a technical task that requires time and a certain amount of money .</i>  <i>Oleg Valerievich is very sullen, the business does not develop, the calls are lost, Sevastopol groans without ivy bears.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>But everything can be done with a few clicks.</i>  <i>Step by step, add all necessary virtual numbers in a personal account of A-FON with a couple of mouse clicks and direct incoming from these numbers to a SIM card (one more click), or you can buy a number right on the spot.</i>  <i>Everything is done.</i>  <i>You can run for diapers: any incoming to any of the numbers by default will go to the SIM card (and this will not be redirected, you do not need to pay every minute), all calls will go into detail and, if necessary, calls can be recorded.</i>  <i>Oleg Valeryevich is happy, a new stage has begun in his business: announcements of the sale of bears appeared all over the country, and in his pocket one single SIM card and full control over calls ‚Äî a record, statistics, the correct display of all incoming numbers.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ea7/9ca/8e9/ea79ca8e9a2043d6b3631081bd04f7c1.jpeg"><br><br>  <b>Second case</b> <br><br>  <i>Anatoly Anatolyevich, well past fifty, a returnee immigrant, in his youth, danced a lot around the world, trying to make a living, selling valuable wood in Burkina Faso and real estate in Albania.</i>  <i>The idea of ‚Äã‚Äãinternational businesses firmly hooked Anatoly Anatolyevich and does not let go until now.</i>  <i>He does not want to work in an office, so he continues to sell everything he can to his former compatriots and foreigners around the world.</i>  <i>At one time, Anatoly Anatolyevich created many sites in 15 countries and, upon a call, he is ready to arrange the transfer of anyone who wants to relocate to Slovenia or sell fuel pellets from Belarus.</i>  <i>On each such site hangs a local phone number, bought on one of the international Internet services for 5 euros.</i>  <i>Foreign partners and Anatoly Anatolyevich‚Äôs customers call these numbers.</i> <i><br><br></i>  <i>A zoo of numbers simply obliges to be constantly in touch - to answer calls and often call back to yourself, which for reasonable money can be done only with the use of Internet telephony.</i>  <i>The businessman is tied with a thick rope to his Lenovo and headset, and the doctor recommended long walks.</i>  <i>Anatoly Anatolyevich in his personal account A-FON sets up all of its 15 foreign numbers, acquires a couple of Russian ones for convenience and connects A-SIM.</i>  <i>Now you can put your mobile phone in your pocket and boldly go for a walk to the nearest park.</i>  <i>All incoming to all virtual numbers will come to the SIM card, and if you need to call back to Argentina, this is easily done from the same mobile phone at the usual rates of Internet telephony.</i>  <i>It turns out that 15 virtual SIM cards from 15 foreign mobile operators fit in Anatoly Anatolievich‚Äôs pocket: those entering Russia are free of charge, outgoing to the numbers of the country of the respective country at economical rates comparable to local tariffs.</i>  <i>Convenient and beautiful.</i>  <i>Anatoly's health improved, he began to walk more and be less nervous, his complexion improved and his income increased.</i> <i><br></i> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/16c/39d/0a6/16c39d0a629b418c9d7f0c7e96e73a63.jpeg"><br><br>  To sum up: the cases described are only half-fantastic examples from life, but they clearly show how convenient and useful the friendship of Internet telephony and mobile communication is.  We are not going to rest on our laurels, our kanban board is hung with pieces of paper with ToDo to the eyeballs and in the next couple of weeks another interesting case will be launched, about which we will definitely write. <br><br>  Show must go on ... ... </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/266651/">https://habr.com/ru/post/266651/</a></p>
