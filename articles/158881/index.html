Why not use your wife (husband)?  I know most of you will think that your wife has no idea how to make a website.  But why not try? <br><br>  Considering modern technologies, almost anyone can now easily learn the basics of working with a website.  My six-year-old nephew works in WordPress.  Moreover, your wife does not have to understand programming, she can help with the simplest tasks.  In this article we will look at all the advantages of involving your wife in working with the website, how to teach your wife to create and maintain a website and other various tasks that could help you in one way or another.  Well, after reading this article, you will be ready to bring your wife to work. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  Pluses attract wife to work on the site </h3><br>  For a freelancer or a team of 2-3 specialists, attracting another participant can be a tremendous help.  Many of you may think that your wife doesn‚Äôt know much about programming, website design, or her promotion, but sometimes it can be a plus.  When you have someone who can offer a fresh look at the site, or work with clients with whom you cooperate - it can be very convenient for you.  As for the work itself - everything can be learned.  So let's assume that you are attracting your wife, and here are some of the advantages that you will get: 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
    <ul><li>  A fresh look </li><li>  Free or cheap resource </li><li>  She knows your work style. </li><li>  You get a person who helps you cope with time-consuming tasks; </li><li>  Women's view on the site, which will help to understand the female audience </li><li>  Additional hands that will help you raise the project to a new level. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  How to quickly train my wife to work with the site? </h3><br>  Given the abundance of video materials (tutorials / manuals) and a magic tool called Google, it is very easy to teach your wife how to work with the site.  Follow the step by step instructions to do this as soon as possible: <br><br><ol><li>  Define one or two assignments for your wife for the first time. </li><li>  Make sure that she can really cope with the tasks you have chosen, entrust her with doing things that take you more time, or you are postponing for later, but you know that they need to be done </li><li>  Find several different video tutorials, articles and blogs that she should watch or read to speed up the process. </li><li>  After she finished the previous paragraph, take some time for her so that she can ask you questions </li><li>  Show her how to do the job. </li><li>  Give her a chance to practice. </li><li>  Stay close to answer questions and support her.  Be positive and attentive. </li></ol><br><br>  If you follow these 7 steps, you will be pleasantly surprised at how quickly your wife will have new skills.  You will be extremely happy that you decided to try to do it.  Also working together will improve your relationship. <br><br><h3>  Customer service </h3><br>  Do you spend a lot of time answering your customers' emails, replying to comments on blogs, as well as phone calls?  This is all a rather important task, but your wife can also handle them easily.  Customer support is an extremely important part of freelance work.  to do <br><br>  Let your wife talk to customers for a few weeks and see how things are going.  I think that your customers will appreciate her work, because it will be more sociable than you. <br><br><h3>  Photos for the site </h3><br>  Does your wife like to take pictures?  Photos are an important component of any site.  Unfortunately, if you do not have enough money or time to purchase photos, or if you are not a photographer, then getting high-quality photos for use on your website presents itself as quite a laborious task.  Other site owners do not particularly complain when people use their photos on their sites without a specific agreement.  Instead of borrowing photos, buy a camera for your wife and let her take the pictures herself.  Your website will look as good as never before if it does the job. <br><br><h3>  Competitor Analysis </h3><br>  Competitor analysis is something I hate to do.  I can remember quite a few cases when I did such an analysis, and this influenced my decisions.  So let the wife act as a "detective" for you.  Make a list of competitive sites that she could explore.  Explain to her what you would like from her in this case and let her take up the research.  This will save you a lot of time, and also outperform your competitors. <br><br><h3>  Writing articles </h3><br>  Maybe your wife is not very good at the art of photography, but she can write better than most authors who are now popular.  Let her do the filling of your site.  You need to know how important it is for website owners to have their own blog.  To increase the quality of content, you need a lot of time.  But time is exactly what we, the developers, often lack. <br><br>  Put together the topics of articles and ask her to write the appropriate article.  When she finishes writing one or two articles, review them together and evaluate the work she has done and let her continue writing.  When you have a person in charge of your blog, it will allow you to focus on the things you are directly involved in (design, promotion, etc.). <br><br><h3>  Work with WordPress </h3><br>  Now that we have analyzed all the advantages of attracting a wife to work on your site, let's delve into several specific tasks that your wife could help you with.  Do you manage a WordPress site?  This is probably the easiest and most flexible engine. <br><br>  Designate several areas of your site in which your wife could participate;  explain to her what you want her to do;  just let her know that at least she can simply search for the necessary information and then let her go to ‚Äúfree floating‚Äù.  Here are some WordPress-related tasks your wife can help accomplish: <br><br><ul><li>  Updating media content on the site </li><li>  Search for new plugins that you can add to your site </li><li>  Check pages for competent internal optimization </li><li>  Work on sidebars and site forms </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Social networks </h3><br>  Is your wife sociable?  She has a lot of friends in social networks?  I know that my wife spends a lot of time on Facebook, then why not let her take care of your account for you.  Returning to the topic of customer support, which we discussed above, it is worth noting that perhaps your wife is more sociable than you. <br><br>  Social networks are directly related to building relationships with people.  Explain to her what you would like her to achieve on Facebook, Twitter using your account, how to use it in business, and let her start actively using Twitter.  I bet you will attract more subscribers, and more people will be involved in your community than ever. <br><br><h3>  How to tell your wife that you need her help </h3><br>  So, now that you know how much you need your wife‚Äôs help, it‚Äôs time to determine how you can get her involved.  Perhaps this will be the most difficult task that we have touched today.  Following are some tips on how to explain to your wife that you need her help: <br><br><ol><li>  Determine exactly which areas of your website your wife would be able to help you with, as she may want to make sure that you thought it out well and really consider her a valuable assistant. </li><li>  Tell her about this news for a pleasant dinner, which you prepare yourself </li><li>  Explain to her that you have a plan according to which you are going to teach her what she has to learn. </li><li>  Bring to her attention that you look forward to working with her, and consider this to be a pleasant collaboration. </li><li>  Do not press on her and be sure to give her time to think </li></ol><br><br>  I believe that many of you will have a rather positive experience if you stick to this strategy.  As they say, behind every great man stands a great woman.  Our wives are smart, have great potential and are patient - these three components are undoubtedly the reason why this can really work. <br><br>  Does your wife help you at work? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/158881/">https://habr.com/ru/post/158881/</a></p>
