With breaks for food and sleep. <br><br>  This is not the first Startup Weekend in Russia, but for the first time it is being held by Glavstart in an updated and expanded format.  We invite ready-made teams, people with ideas and people with desire to the Weekend. <br> <a href="http://moscow.startupweekend.org/"><img src="http://moscow.startupweekend.org/wp-content/themes/default-city-moscow/images/startup/sw-header.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br>  Most people react rather sluggishly when you start telling them about your idea - most often they answer like this: "Show me something working, then I will believe."  This is especially true for people whose attention is of fundamental importance for any project - for experts and investors.  Startup Weekend will help solve this problem. <br><br>  The main goal of Startup Weekend is to ‚Äúcompress‚Äù time, i.e.  to help you in three days to go from the idea to the first prototype, which can be shown to colleagues, experts and investors. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  At Weekend, everyone will find something to do.

      1. <b>Ready teams with ideas or ideas of projects</b> .  If you are just starting your project and realize that you would not be bothered by expert advice, this is for you. <br><br>  Teams will be able to present their projects on Friday evening, get advice from experts, reflect on them and work in the right direction on Saturday and Sunday.  On Friday, from 6 pm, you will be listened to and given advice (without-the-way) <b>Igor Ashmanov, Askar Tuganbaev, German Klimenko, Arkady Moreynis, Yuri Virovets, Oleg Bunin</b> and others. <br>  On Sunday, representatives of investors (including partners of this Startup Weekend, Yandex and HeadHunter) will come to the final screening of projects. <br><br>  2. <b>People with ideas</b> .  If you have an idea, but no team yet, this is about you. <br><br>  On Friday we are waiting for you at the review of starting projects.  See, listen, draw conclusions. <br>  On Saturday morning, the session will start especially for you, where you can <b>present your ideas and interest potential team members</b> who will help you on Saturday and Sunday to take the first steps to the prototype of your project. <br>  On Sunday evening, the teams that managed to make their prototypes will be able to present them to potential investors as part of the overall final display of projects. <br><br>  3. <b>People with desire</b> .  You have no project or ideas for which you are ready to assemble teams.  You want to see how it happens, try on yourself, maybe work in a team or still come up with your own idea?  You will not leave us empty-handed :) <br><br>  On Friday, we invite you to watch the teams and listen to the experts.  On Saturday - welcome to the selection of ideas and selection of teams.  But if you do not find ideas for yourself, do not rush to leave! <br>  Specially for you on Saturday and Sunday there will be <b>mini-sections, trainings, brainstorms</b> .  In general, everything that will help you spend time with benefit and come up with your own idea. <br>  If this happens, on Sunday after lunch you will have the chance to present your idea to the masses and even assemble a team, and then see what happened in one weekend for those who worked on their projects. <br>  What for?  To come to the next Weekend with a thought-out idea or even a ready-made team, and take a new step towards your success. <br><br>  Participation in Startup Weekend is free.  To participate you just need to register <a href="http://moscow.startupweekend.org/">here</a> .  If you have any questions, you can ask us at info@glavstart.ru or in the comments. <br><br>  upd.  projects we invite on Friday for the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/glavstart/blog/100157/">"day of advice</a> . <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/glavstart/blog/100157/">"</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/99697/">https://habr.com/ru/post/99697/</a></p>
