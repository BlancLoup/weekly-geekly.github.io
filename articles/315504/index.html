Perhaps their answers will help to identify some general patterns, useful tips that will help many of us. <br><br>  Today our guest is Viktor Tarnavsky, the head of development in several projects of Yandex.  In particular, a year ago he inherited Yandex.Metrica from its former leader, Artur Siulin. <a name="habracut"></a><br><br clear="all"><br clear="all">  <b>What do you do in the company?</b>

      I work in Yandex and I am engaged in analytical products - Yandex.Metrica, AppMetrica, Yandex.  Lecture hall".  They are developed in my department. <br><br>  <b>One word (phrase) best describes how you work</b> <br><br>  Interesting, fast and efficient. <br><br>  <b>How many hours a day do you spend on work?</b> <br><br>  8 to 10 hours. <br><br>  <b>How many hours do you sleep?</b> <br><br>  Approximately 7.5 hours. <br><br>  <b>Do you have breakfast</b> <br><br>  I have breakfast every day. <br><br>  <b>What are you doing on the way to / from work?</b>  <b>A lot of time goes on the road?</b> <br><br>  Decently  Probably an hour and a half.  20 minutes I'm driving.  The rest of the time I read all sorts of articles, surf the Internet or check email. <br><br>  <b>What kind of todo-manager do you use personally?</b> <br><br>  No, I do not use it.  I just write notes.  I have a physical notebook. <br><br>  3 company related questions: <br><br>  <b>What kind of task manager do you use / issue tracker / repository?</b> <br><br>  We have an internal task manager, also an issue tracker.  In the company, we use our own solution after JIRA began to slow down completely.  In Yandex, we use several repositories, but in our department Github is used. <br><br>  <b>What is your working environment?</b>  <b>Framework, other third-party products?</b> <br><br>  If we talk about the database, then our department uses ClickHouse.  We have about 800 servers on this database.  MySQL and ZooKeeper are very actively used.  We use it wherever possible. <br><br>  Our department writes in different languages ‚Äã‚Äã- Java, C ++, JavaScript, Python.  Java developers naturally use IntelliJ IDEA, web developers use WebStorm or vim.  C ++ developers use mostly KDevelop, since this environment ‚Äúdigests‚Äù our volumes of code well. <br><br>  <b>Do you have any internal projects in your department and why were they created?</b> <br><br>  This is our full house, of course.  One example is Clickhouse.  In 2009, we started this in-house project within the framework of Yandex.Metrica.  Now he has grown to open source.  And we also create other mini-solutions, but usually they are not so large. <br><br>  <b>What annoys you most when you work?</b> <br><br>  I can not single out anything that would annoy me or be my painful point ... Because if it is, I usually do something. <br><br>  Is that ... When we communicate with external users, and they incorrectly use tools to solve their problems.  It upsets me a lot. <br><br>  <b>What professional literature would you recommend?</b> <br><br>  I was more influenced by blogs, because usually books lag behind advanced trends. <br><br>  <b>What do you prefer: electronic reading rooms or paper books?</b> <br><br>  Paper. <br><br>  <b>What equipment (computers, tablets, smartphones) and why do you prefer at work and at home?</b> <br><br>  Apple - both at home and at work.  C Apple is easier: the iron is very good. <br><br>  <b>Do you listen to music when you work?</b> <br><br>  When I write code, yes.  But another part of my work is conversations with which listening to music is obviously incompatible. <br><br>  <b>Which life hack allows you to be more efficient?</b> <br><br>  The ability to effectively use IDE when developing is difficult to call life hacking, but very few people do. <br><br>  <b>And in life or in the managerial component?</b> <br><br>  If you have a very active correspondence with the person who is missing you and cannot answer him, there is a wonderful ‚Äúsend later‚Äù function in mail services, for example, tomorrow.  That is, he can write to you again not earlier than tomorrow.  Thus this problem is solved: written and forgotten. <br><br>  <b>What applications and services can you do without in your work or in your personal life?</b> <br><br>  Calendar, Telegram. <br><br>  <b>What professional advice from the past could you give yourself?</b> <br><br>  Remember about fun.  Have time to enjoy life. <br><br>  <b>What would you recommend to a person trying to go the same way?</b> <br><br>  To think with your head, not to trust completely any opinion, know how to write f * cking code well. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/315504/">https://habr.com/ru/post/315504/</a></p>
