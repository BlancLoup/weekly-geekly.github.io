There is a skill that you can master, and which guarantees you the following: everything you do will improve by at least 50%, but, what's even more likely, by 100%, and with time and even more. <br><br>  The best thing about this skill is it is simple.  Take possession of everyone.  You do not need to have some natural talent.  You do not need any special resources or teachers to master them.  As soon as you gain this skill, it will become part of your daily activities, and the pace of your work will increase.  You will become more successful, and your reputation will bring you more opportunities.

      <i>As Morpheus said from the immortal "Matrix": "Do you want to know what it is?"</i> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Just do all the bullshit you need to do. </h2><br>  Yes it is.  Read again.  Let rooted in the memory. <br><br>  How does it look in practice?  Respond to emails immediately, never delay with this for more than 24 hours.  If you promised to meet with a man for some reason - do not let them down.  Get to the end all that you promised to complete, and do it on time.  When you say, "I will read this book," or "I will look at this site," or "I will send my resume," then do it.  Without delay.  If you can't or won't do it all, then don't talk about it.  Every time you say you do something and you don‚Äôt, you lose another opportunity to become better than most of your competitors and build strong bonds with other people. <br><br>  In 90% of situations, I would give an advantage to a person who responds to mail consistently and on the same day, completing projects exactly as promised and when promised, than to someone who is fluent in any other skills.  And in this I am not alone.  The desperate need for hardworking reliable people who are constantly in touch is incredibly great. <br><br>  If people are forced to wait for your answer or ponder whether you basically bring your affairs to an end, then you become expensive for them, even if it is only psychological costs.  People prefer not to work with those who are costly for them - they want to work with people who never have to spend any mental energy in their experiences.  They want to work with those who pleasantly surprise them with the provision of services above all expectations. <br><br>  Everyone can be a person who always brings things to the end, is always in touch, always gives up work and never leaves anyone waiting or hanging.  This is just a matter of desire and discipline. <br><br>  Just do what needs to be done. <br><br>  <b>About the author:</b> Isaac Morehouse (Isaac Morehouse) is an entrepreneur, a thinker, and a skillful conversationalist devoted to the relentless pursuit of freedom.
