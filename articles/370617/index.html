Online retailer UMmall - the one that scandalously promoted the Bluedio headphones - today came with a number of important news.  List: <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ We restarted on the new site <a href="http://umkamall.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes-promo">umkamall.ru</a> with a new design.  It has become much more beautiful and convenient than it was before (earlier, by the way, our address was <a href="http://umkamall.ru/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes-promo">ummall.ru</a> ). <br><br>  ‚Ä¢ The second news (perhaps even more pleasant) - the first five hundred buyers of goods on the new site, we <b>give a</b> smart watch Howellworld HW-G08A.  Such a thing, by the way, costs 2,170 rubles.  However, the first buyers have the opportunity to get it for free, just as a nice addition to any other product.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/f3f/21a/4f1/f3f21a4f19304439840ff4aab6db3b6e.jpg"><br><br>  Below is a small FAQ about the principles of our work, the action described above and in general everything that we consider necessary to convey to customers. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  <b>1. Why buy at UMmall, if you have AliExpress?</b> <br><br>  And everything is very simple: goods from China go up to a month, nobody gives a normal guarantee for them, does not provide technical support.  Anyway, a brick can come in the box, and you cannot prove anything to anyone.  Well, the customs can wrap the devices you ordered or any other piece, which is also unpleasant. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/b20/f1e/c35/b20f1ec3521b43bc9a65632a05367852.jpg"><br><br>  Whether it's a UMmall business: we have been on the market since 2015, during this time about 10 thousand products have been sold, and every third buyer returns to us again.  At the same time, our prices are the same as on Ali.  In fact, we corrected all the flaws of "Ali" and got a kind of hybrid of the largest Chinese trading platform and a good Russian online store.  From "Ali" took the range and prices, adding to this guarantee, fast delivery and technical support. <br><br>  <b>2. How can prices be the same as on Ali?</b>  <b>All this is muddy!</b> <br><br>  UMmall has direct contracts with dozens of Chinese electronics manufacturers.  From here and very tasty prices - sometimes they are even lower than on AliExpress!  We are not resellers of Chinese retail goods - this is our key difference from most Russian online stores.  We have our own complicated, but very reliable scheme: only direct contracts with the guys from China.  As an example, it is worth remembering the same brand Bluedio - this is such a premium Chinese manufacturer of headphones.  In Russia, his sole official representative is us, UMmall.  But what Bluedio - look at umkamall.ru and look at the brands, with each of them we have a direct contract. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/375/160/477/375160477924484589ea7f7c753baf1c.jpg"><br><br>  <b>3. Well, ok, and how was it possible to arrange a quick delivery?</b> <br><br>  Yes, our delivery is very fast: Muscovites are guaranteed to receive an order within 3 business days, residents of St. Petersburg and the Leningrad Region - within 4-5 days.  For other regions, be it at least Primorsky Krai, delivery takes place within a maximum of 7 days.  Compare with two or three weeks, or even a month in the case of AliExpress and their ilk. <br><br>  The trick is that we do not expect goods from China before transferring them to the buyer.  We have our own warehouses in Russia with a total area of ‚Äã‚Äã30 thousand square meters.  That is, all the goods offered at umkamall.ru are already on the territory of the Russian Federation.  They have already passed customs, they have already been sorted, tested for reliability and are waiting for orders from buyers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/069/ef0/e70/069ef0e708324c3da0675f1488e1070b.jpg"><br><br>  <b>4. And with a guarantee we have a piece?</b> <br><br>  It's all cool with her, not like the guys with AliExpress.  Most products offered at UMmall have a one-year warranty.  In the event of a breakdown, you either get a new device from us (see delivery times above), or, if replacement devices are not available, money.  Let's pay attention: at a warranty case the mechanism is extremely transparent and simple.  You communicate with the Russian-speaking representatives of UMmall, and not with nameless Chinese, who a priori do not plan to solve your problem and are generally indifferent to it.  And we are not indifferent. <br><br>  <b>5. And what about the action and free watch?</b>  <b>Somewhere in here is a trick!</b> <br><br>  The essence is simple: first, it is just nice for us to present this small gift to the first customers.  Secondly, it makes quite practical sense for us - such a step will provide a certain critical mass of actions on the site, which, in turn, will allow us to thoroughly test it.  The site is completely new, and although we tested it thoroughly before launching, we might not have noticed something.  And so the massive purchases, provoked by our bonus in the form of Howellworld HW-G08A, will allow the site to be tested as soon as possible, and buyers will also be pleased.  UMmall this will be only happy! <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/web/184/d04/bbe/184d04bbe0934fd7ba51531a8719c956.jpg"><br><br>  And yes, a few words about the clock.  <a href="https://umkamall.ru/10369/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes-promo">Howellworld HW-G08A was</a> created by Shenzhen Howellworld Technology.  It was founded in 1999, owns its own R &amp; D, production and has very close contacts with Google.  In particular, in 2008, Google invested in dozens of companies to explore Android and launch the first devices with the new OS on board.  Shenzhen Howellworld Technology was among these companies.  Howellworld HW-G08A is equipped with a SIM card slot, a camera, GPS and Bluetooth modules, and can work with iOS and Android devices.  Well, they look like an Apple Watch (emoticon). <br><br>  *** <br>  It is very possible that you still have questions after reading this post, although we have tried to highlight all the key points.  So if the questions remain - welcome to the comments! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/370617/">https://habr.com/ru/post/370617/</a></p>
