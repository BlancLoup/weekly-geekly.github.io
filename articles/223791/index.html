We are happy (excitement, trembling, trembling in the knees and a dry throat) to introduce you to the pilot release of our video review of amazing gadgets, on which we worked for a long time and hard (so that it turned out to be short and bottomhole).  In this video, the legendary Boris ‚ÄúBonus‚Äù Repetition tells you about the <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/pulsometr-mio-alpha/">Mio ALPHA heart rate</a> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/tinke/">monitor, Tinke health monitor</a> and <a href="http://madrobots.ru/catalog/zdorove_2_0/lumoback-monitor-osanki/">Lumoback posture monitor</a> . <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/anSfpkBNoOQ%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhDkYw34U5wVihfv0AmadsnPJHYzw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Why should the creators of an online store turn into video bloggers? <a name="habracut"></a>

      It's simple.  We sell cool things that can make people's lives easier and more interesting.  But, as in everything new, they are not always easy to understand on the go.  Therefore, we are constantly puzzled over how it would be more intelligible and more fascinating to talk about the world of gadgets, not only to geeks, but also to a wide audience.  These thoughts led us to the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãlaunching our own video channel.  Well, or in any case, experiment with video reviews - and see what happens. <br><br>  The question immediately arose: what should be the perfect MadRobots movie?  We all remember the shops on the couch that exist in an incredible world where people behave as if they had just been made a lobotomy. <br><blockquote>  Can't break eggs?  Here's the egg cell!  Can't open a bag of milk?  You need a whistle that you can drive into the bag to make it better. </blockquote><br>  We have a different approach.  We want to tell intelligent people how to really improve their lives with the help of new technologies.  Therefore, they began to study what happens in the world in general, and came to the conclusion that there are three genres of reviews of new technology on the Internet: unboxing video, first impressions and stories about operating experience. <br><br>  <b>Unboxing videos</b> show how a person pulls a device out of the box.  Actually, nothing more to add.  For example: <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/IpFcFypzZlY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiywXmZz-vU0AQsr2KkumEZXWWyAQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The guy did not even show how the iPhone works, and the video gained more than two million views!  Just interest in technology in the past few years has grown dramatically.  Now gadgets - this is not only the lot of geeks, this is already a pop culture.  (Thanks to Apple, Kickstarter and the Internet.) And these videos are watched by those who are not even going to buy anything, but just want to stare. <br><br>  Those who talk about the <b>first impressions of the operation</b> , go a little further - and at least press the power button.  These videos have been shot already for those who want to buy something - they are designed to help them make a decision.  It is easy to see that the rollers are quite boring. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/_dwBBJxEGkU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiklMTGxPxESItZ9-X-xxvl6axkgQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Finally, the third genre is the <b>experience of long exploitation</b> .  Usually such videos are written after using the equipment for at least two weeks.  The genre is quite subjective, but this is good - people usually find one author who is sympathetic to them, and they watch everything he tells. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/W9QSFO0zx60%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiEU8XI9Ahlo7wXOEUOpnBYlotSLg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Having studied all these options, we decided that none of these genres in our pure form does not fit.  Therefore, we decided to combine all genres, and even use humorous inserts to add a little bit of life to the dry genre of techno-review.  Good and fun - always better than good and sad. <br><br>  Of course, the question immediately arose before us: whom to invite to lead?  Who was interested in computer games in the nineties (that is, the entire male population over the age of twenty-five) cannot but remember the program on the RTR channel ‚ÄúFrom the Screw!‚Äù With the leading Bonus and Gamover.  We here remember.  And they thought that it would be great to invite the ‚ÄúGreat Bonus‚Äù to the role of the lead great Boris. <br><br>  To our delight, he agreed.  Pilot script writer Yevgeny Ognev is a big fan of Repetition (like the whole MadRobots team).  And while on the set, Boris, finding typos or blots in the script, strictly scolded Eugene, they seem to have parted as friends.  Yes, and our gadgets, he apparently liked: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d67/ef9/52c/d67ef952cca79cba8e685f122bf250f2.jpg"><br><br>  A word to the screenwriter Evgeny Ognev: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúI watched videos with Boris Repetur, which I could find.  I needed to understand in detail exactly how he communicates with the viewer.  Each person has his own way of speaking, I had to understand how Boris does this in order to write texts that he would easily and easily submit to the camera.  I told the jokes from the video to everyone who did not beat me for me sticking to him.  I looked at the reaction, listened to the criticism and cried in the pillow, if someone did not like some kind of joke ... ‚Äù. <br></blockquote><br>  Yevgeny himself made the director of the roller - together with Nikita Luppov.  They both work in the studio " <a href="http://www.ps1147.ru/">11:47 Production</a> ", which is engaged in the production of clips for the Internet.  On the one hand, their name is associated with the year Moscow was founded (1147), and on the other, with the distance from Moscow to Izhevsk (1147 km), where most of the team comes from.  11:47 - pure startup, they are still filling cones and learn.  (That's probably why we quickly found a common language). <br><br>  A word to producer Elizaveta Glavatskikh: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúOur story began with the fact that we became a pocket production of one company, which in the future provided us with a download of 15 short-format online TV shows on YouTube.  We smeared skis for this case, removed 150 squares for a studio with a jacuzzi and sauna ... But one march in March afternoon we received a letter stating that the whole production was fired.  The PR manager of the customer, recommended by us - and not yet hired - in the working correspondence with colleagues incorrectly wrote the name of the founder, having made a mistake in one letter.  After that, almost 20 people teams in two cities rushed to acquire mortgaging machines and think about how to live in one hundred percent independence.  (Of course, the true reasons, not reasons, were not only in the extreme vulnerability of the founder, but also in objectively not the highest rates of viewing of our video content). ‚Äù <br></blockquote><br>  Having gone on an independent voyage, the guys nevertheless found their way and now they have already eaten a dog on the creation of clips for the Internet.  Now they are trying to break into the production of TV shows and movies.  They even made a pilot of a zombie series that caught the attention of TV producers.  Who knows, maybe in a year you will see it by turning on the TV. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/lFr5jDuRKDo%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgNmUkARHB5fczp59h8lZzIWXJfwg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  The office and studio 11:47 are located in the Amedia company building at the Volgogradsky Prospekt metro station.  They took it off, because it is a ‚Äúplace of power‚Äù, dozens of TV series, sitcoms and films are being filmed there, this place is almost the main platform for pavilion filming in Moscow.  There they are really fun. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b48/e89/0fd/b48e890fd1c26d1580a69b7deb10f86b.jpg"><br><br>  Elizabeth told us that a couple of weeks ago it was possible to work only with gauze on her face.  In Amedia, the scenery of the series about firemen burned down - in the pavilion right under the office at 11:47.  Russian film industry - truly merciless and harsh.  A week later, the same pavilion was flooded. <br><br>  In general, working with smart, but still hungry (in a good way) people is a pleasure.  The eyes are burning, the ideas are full, they are ready for experiments.  Therefore, we turned to them, and it seems they coped with the first video with a bang. <br><br>  However, in the end, we were surprised to find, being profane in this matter, that the actual shooting is not the most difficult.  During the day, the hromakey (this is such a green rag that hangs in the studio, any background is then superimposed on it), the actor can tell the material to five rollers.  But to finish the rest and mount it takes a lot of time. <br><br>  We hope that our sufferings will not be wasted in vain and you will like our unique ‚Äúshop on the couch‚Äù.  One would like to say finally: from the screw! <br><br> <a href="https://twitter.com/MadrobotsRu"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ac1/fc6/d2a/ac1fc6d2a19948c59791b0da6ab659df.gif"></a> <a href="http://vk.com/madrobots"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/933/ac3/0b6/933ac30b6fd24ffd82218148c2fb0917.gif"></a> <a href="http://instagram.com/madrobotsru"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/464/a82/e04/464a82e045a34bae81406fd0b640cf08.gif"></a> <a href="http://facebook.com/madrobotsrussia"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/0b5/542/136/0b55421365064901acdf0ed58cc4a111.gif"></a> <br> <a href="http://madrobots.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/63d/405/78e/63d40578ecbf48f28c62f57705c73eb6.gif"></a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223791/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223791/</a></p>
