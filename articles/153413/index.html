      Automating the process of captcha recognition for many people actively doing business on the Internet is a pressing issue.  You can treat such businessmen and professionals as "bad and annoying spammers."  However, it is not possible to stop the spam posting process, at least in the foreseeable future. <br><br>  Link marketing here fully and uniquely combines the solution of the tasks of promotion, increasing the reputation of the site being promoted in the eyes of search engines.  This happens for the simple reason that every link to a site (including from a spam post) increases its position in the output of Google, Yandex, etc.  Therefore, such a method of ‚Äúkilling two birds with one stone‚Äù is advantageous initially.  And a significant part of Internet businessmen should not struggle with spam posting, but try to use it for their own purposes. <br><br><h3>  So, the relevance of solving the ‚Äúbypass captcha‚Äù problem is beyond doubt. </h3><br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The task is automatically solved when carrying out companies in manual mode, by hiring hundreds of posters.  But to talk about the effectiveness of this method, if not today, then tomorrow will not have to.  Yes, the problem of captcha input for the customer here is really not relevant.  But organizational, time and financial costs with this method of action do not stand up to serious criticism. <br><br>  Therefore, specialized software products, automatic posters, have been actively developing for several years already.  Some of them are well known in the market (the same XRumer), some - developed and used only within certain firms.  In the case of using an automatic poster, the solution to the problem ‚Äúhow to get around a captcha‚Äù is possible in two ways: <br><br><ul><li>  its manual entry or use of services where recognition is performed by human operators; </li><li>  the addition of poster software with automatic captcha recognition modules. </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Manual input </h3><br><br>  We note immediately that manual input is unacceptable with serious posting volumes. <br><br>  Recognizing captcha today can be entrusted to special services (for example, antigate).  Issue price - $ 1-2.5 per thousand recognition.  The disadvantages of this method include: <br><br><ul><li>  fixed financial costs for each posting company; </li><li>  large time delays in recognition.  On average, captcha services promise to recognize <br>  5-20 seconds.  Although this is already a lot, but in fact this time may turn out to be much longer. </li></ul><br><br>  A positive feature for this kind of services is independence from the type of captcha, since the recognition is carried out by a real human operator. <br><br><h3>  Software recognition </h3><br><br>  Today, a complex theoretical and practical problem is the development of artificial systems for recognizing graphic images.  Optical character recognition, as applied to captchas, is not so simple a task as the recognition of scanned or handwritten text, because the captcha developers impose such effects on the characters so that software recognition becomes impossible. <br><br>  However, despite this, the creation of captcha recognition programs is our specialty.  Of course, this activity can be treated differently, including, and negatively, but we understand that thanks to our programs, comments are automatically posted to blogs, SMS messages are sent out, mail accounts are registered for subsequent spam.  But what we do can be compared to selling knives - you can cut bread with a knife, or you can kill someone ... Is the manufacturer or seller of the knife guilty in this case? .. Everyone has his own opinion ... <br><br>  There is no universal software for recognizing any type of captcha.  Therefore, the software of automatic posters is consistently supplemented with modules for recognizing its necessary varieties.  The development of such software is carried out by individual teams, for example, we <a href="http://www.captcha-lab.org/">www.captcha-lab.org</a> .  In our portfolio, a demo program for captcha input is not presented for one type.  Of particular interest are the development team for the CMS Bitrix captcha (officially - 1C-Bitrix).  This CMS is not just popular in Russia, but takes the first place among paid circulation "engines".  Naturally, the "breaking" of the captcha Beatrix <br>  He was interested and interested in many specialists.  In 2006, there was even a successful attempt to perform such an ‚Äúoperation‚Äù.  However, then the CMS Bitrix developers changed the type of captcha, and so far it has remained invulnerable.  As the demo programs from <a href="http://www.captcha-lab.org/">www.captcha-lab.org demonstrate</a> , this problem has now been solved with rather high rates - 64% and 60% for different versions of Beatrix.  Do you think these figures are high enough?  Indeed, other types of captcha software released by our team of programmers are recognized with a probability of up to 90%.  There really is no limit to perfection.  But these figures are high enough for work.  Note that the use of a captcha service also ensures correct recognition only in 80-95% of cases. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1be/a75/8e0/1bea758e036d521b7a14ff3e60a88108.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>1 - Recognizing the old version of the CMS Bitrix captcha</i> <br><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a85/4cb/66a/a854cb66a53a61c3e89fe2ac7332e25c.jpg"><br>  <i>Fig.</i>  <i>2 - Recognizing the new version of the CMS Bitrix captcha</i> <br><br><br>  How much will the development of a captcha program cost?  $ 100-500, depending on its type, complexity.  Note that this is a one-time waste.  Thus, unlike captcha services, automatic recognition allows you to seriously win the issue price.  In addition, a significant time gain is also ensured: software rarely takes more than a second to recognize. <br><br>  We remind you that you can see all the ‚Äúmade‚Äù by us captcha on our website <a href="http://www.captcha-lab.org/rus/portfolio/">in the portfolio section</a> . </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/153413/">https://habr.com/ru/post/153413/</a></p>
