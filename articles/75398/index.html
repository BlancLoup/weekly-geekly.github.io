      It has existed for over 100 years without any significant changes.  The fact that bone abacus and adding machines changed to computers does not change the essence of this system.  Its high cost, slowness, ‚Äútransparency‚Äù for tax and other authorities are no secret to anyone.  Imaginary customer care is a skeptical grin rather than a desire to somehow challenge this claim.  Is a ‚Äúfavorite client‚Äù able to bend a banking institution into a broken birch pose, say under the threat of a license, to give to give confidential data about another client? <br>  And any government agency can.  And how!  And all because it holds, directly or indirectly, this institution <s>for the feberge with</s> its strong hand. <br>  So, banks turned from ‚Äúmoney storage banks‚Äù into a certain informer of tax specialists and other security officials. <br><br>  And the "wiring" of money for 3-5 days?  Do they drive them through their corridors and storages?  And the "enrollment" of the money received only the next day?  Marinating our money with you for several days under various unconvincing pretexts, banks are thereby credited without interest! <br><br>  And who pays considerable salary to numerous clerks, heads of departments, credit specialists, operations officers, security services, etc.  etc? <br><br>  Yes, in general, we are with you, friends!  And we were asked - do we want to do it or not? <br><br>  So, give tribute to tradition and keep money in banks?  Stupid and short-sighted. <br><br>  1. About your money and account movements a priori knows the MASS of people for whom you are not a relative, not a friend or a business partner.  And to give or not to give to ANYONE comprehensive information on you is just a matter of time or one's interest. <br><br>  In the electronic payment systems we are considering, at least there is no mass of clerks, i.e.  physical people with access. <br>  Your money is a pair of lines in a kind of database, managed by superadmin, admin, owner or trusted person and having access to the outside world through the WEB interface. <br><br>  And that's it! <br>  Moreover, often all these people are physically located in different jurisdictions; moreover, often no one really knows real names, tax numbers and other IDs. <br><br>  2. Simply throwing you in the money for the bank does not make any problems.  The probability of return is negligible.  How many banks does lawyers and other hookers serve?  And you? <br>  The reasons and excuses to send you away mass - a crisis, non-payment, "bad loans", exchange rate jumps, failures in the system, just not enough money. <br><br>  Alternative - EPS? <br><br>  It is terrible to entrust your blood it is not clear to whom and it is not clear where?  Do you seriously think that having a license, a 10-storey building, a snatched manager in a $ 1,000 suit guarantees you that everything will be fine with money? <br><br>  So - how strong are EPS? <br>  First of all - the strong dependence of their reputation and, accordingly, the availability of working capital from customer feedback. <br><br>  It is worthwhile for the EPS to tell the tale itself, as millions of people immediately recognize this, for whom the Internet is their habitat and they monitor the situation all the time, unlike the accountants of 35-45 years, who constitute an overwhelming contingent of banks and tax walkers. <br><br>  But this is not the main thing.  The trick is that EPS does not operate with its own or client money, and even with no money at all.  Defacto EPS are independent emission centers!  Those.  how much money they need - and so much is produced, the security of this issue is the degree of customer TRUST, the popularity of this EPS.  Nobody gave them permission to issue their currencies, be it paypal, WM and others.  And they did not ask anyone for permission. <br><br>  And their currencies have strange names - title signs, certificates ... <br>  One way or another, no matter how they are called, their purpose is to serve as an exchange equivalent and to buy and sell, they regularly perform. <br><br>  The reality is that the micropayment market has gone entirely to the EPS, and the larger one pulls up with a monthly turnover of $ 1000-10000. <br>  The largest one - from $ 1000000, will traditionally long rotate exclusively in the banking sector for many reasons. <br><br>  The real battle will unfold very soon from 10 thousand to 1 million per month.  We are waiting for the winner! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/75398/">https://habr.com/ru/post/75398/</a></p>
