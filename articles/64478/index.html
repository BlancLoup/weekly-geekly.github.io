  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Is Apple possibly designing a new OS - Apple OS X iTablet?</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A new information about the upcoming netbook from Apple is being actively discussed, for example, in the topic <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/iTablet/64338/"><b>‚ÄúiTablet my forecast ...‚Äù</b></a> <br>  In my humble opinion, Apple‚Äôs netbook is: <br>  A tablet with a ~ 10 "touchscreen, inside of which is likely to be an ARM architecture processor developed by <a href="http://deepapple.com/news/34648.html">PA Semi</a> engineers. <br>  And in the form of an OS, one of the NEW Apple OS X variants will work for him. <br><br>  Already today, Apple has 3 full-fledged commercial versions of its OS and MacOS X - this is: <br>  1. Apple MacOS X Leopard 10.5 - OS for all modifications of the Macintosh; <br>  2. Apple TV 2.3 Software - cropped and modified version of Apple MacOS X Tiger; <br>  3. Apple iPhoneOS 3.0 is an Apple MacOS X Leopard variant that is cut, modified and recompiled for ARM processors. <br><br>  And all these variations with circumcision, free modification, recompilation, and release of various variations of the Apple MacOS X OS are only possible due to the fact that in 1997 Apple merged with Next Software! <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  After this event, Apple‚Äôs modern OS is not based on modular Linux, such as Google Android and Google <a href="http://news.softodrom.ru/ap/b5089.shtml">ChromeOS</a> , but one of the most flexible object-oriented OSs is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTSTEP"><b>NEXTstep</b></a> , which was originally designed in the late 1980s with such an eye that it would it is easy to add and remove new parts - OS objects, and so that the OS can be easily adapted to any variety of platforms: from a supercomputer to a phone.

      And I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if Apple develops another 4th version of its OS, specially designed for Apple Tablet computers iTablet :) <br><br>  Notice that Apple has recently tried not to make unnecessary gestures, and not a year ago, <a href="http://macspoon.ru/mac-os-x/os-x-trademark/">Apple registered a trademark of OS X</a> , which has not been much advertised so far. <br>  But with the release of the Netbook, Apple will probably have 4 OSEs: <br>  1. Apple OS X iMac 10.6 - a full-fledged former MacOS X 10.6 Snow Leopard; <br>  2. Apple OS X iTV 2.3 - the former Apple TV 2.3 Software; <br>  3. Apple OS X iPhone 3.1 - which is essentially a cropped, modified and recompiled MacOS X; <br>  4. Apple OS X iTablet 1.0 - which is likely to be very similar in principle to the Apple OS X iPhone, but it will also contain a number of functions taken from full-fledged MacOS X, for example, such as multitasking! <br><br>  And judging by the fact that the release dates of MacOS X 10.6 Snow Leopard coincide - September-October, with the release of the Netbook (according to rumors in October), purely technologically, the design of the iron of the Netbook can already be completely finished, and the delay until the autumn can be connected with revision of the special OS version for the Netbook-Tablet PC :) <br><br>  And the most remarkable thing is that the OS and NEXTstep paradigm implies the use of object-oriented software, which should work with minimal modifications on all variants, modifications and recompilations of OS NEXTstep.  And the same thing can and should be said about the Apple MacOS X, with the only caveat that up to the version including MacOS X 10.5 - compatibility with the old Apple MacOS 9.0, bolted by the cruel method, remained in it. <br>  But for 10 years Apple has been trying to rewrite its software under the new NEXTstep API, and now, in the first version of the Apple MacOS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, we find, first, a complete rejection of the support of the old PowerPC platform, plus attempts to get rid of partly from the legacy of the old Apple MacOS 9.0 - some of the old APIs are no longer supported. <br><br>  And all this leads to the fact that maybe we will live even to such a time when the program once written for the Apple OS X platform - practically without any modification will work both on Apple MacOS X 10.6 Snow Leopard, and on Apple TV, and on Apple iPhoneOS, as well as the new version of Apple OS X iTablet. <br>  Well, of course, most likely the rule will act in the direction that all programs designed for small devices will run without problems on large ones, but restrictions are possible in the opposite direction - because the small 3.5 "screen of the phone does not allow launching software designed to work on 20 "screen :) <br><br>  And it is possible that these object-oriented features and capabilities of Apple OS X (the former NEXTstep) we will see and be able to evaluate in the fall of 2009. <br>  When a fundamentally new type of device comes out - Apple's Tablet with its new Apple OS X iTablet, on which almost all programs written for the Apple iPhone will work without modification, but it is also possible that with some reservations some modern software written for the full-fledged Apple MacOS X 10.6 Snow Leopard! <br><br>  What do you think about this? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/64478/">https://habr.com/ru/post/64478/</a></p>
