  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Black Friday: China adopts tradition</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Black Friday has a lot in common with the Chinese bachelor's day.  And it's not about the grand sales, but rather the sad events at the origins.  We have already said that 11.11 was a reaction to unpopular measures of the government, and today we will remember how Black Friday began.  And at the same time we will offer you a selection - this time without smartphones and quadrocopters, but with interesting and necessary devices.  And again, we are making an unusual move for the market - we disclose the prices of goods until Friday, November 25, in order for Geektimes readers to have time for discounts first. <br><br> <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/jd/blog/282202/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/f33/08d/3b0/f3308d3b040f5424cd9a071a39377ba7.png"></a> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  We all heard about ‚Äúblack Tuesday‚Äù, when stock indexes collapsed.  But there was a black Friday in the history of stock markets.  On that day, two financial scammers, Jason Gould and James Fisk, miraculously bought up all the gold that was sold on the stock exchange and in banks in New York.  Obeying the laws of the market, the price of the precious metal immediately soared by 20%.  Companies that had to pay for their purchases at prices calculated on the basis of the old price of gold were forced to fulfill their obligations at the new rate and suffered huge losses, which led to an inevitable decline in the entire US economy.  Gould and Fisk earned $ 11 million on their deal. <br><br>  Sales fame came to Black Friday in the early 60s, when Americans swept away everything that went on the sales days before Thanksgiving Day (and later the first day of Christmas sales).  The police on the roads had to be tight and, unable to control the traffic and the situation, they called this day their ‚Äúblack Friday‚Äù.  The name went to the people.  Then there were attempts to rename the gloomy black Friday into a big one, but, as we see, they ended in failure.

      Since the Chinese bachelor's day 11.11 has turned into a world day of shopping, why not Black Friday to emigrate to China?  There is grace for her: thousands of manufacturers, growing brands, developed online retail.  We have prepared a <a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/cDUrj6Bakwy4oJI.html"><b>landing</b></a> page with several tabs - so that you can pick up a product for any needs, sexes and ages.  Pay special attention to the section JD Collection - we are responsible for the quality! <br><br>  <b>Short introductory:</b> if it is indicated that the discount price will be on a flash sale, this means that it may appear at random time from November 25 to November 30 in the flash sales section.  If there is no indication, the price will be valid for the entire period of the action from November 25 to 30. <br><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">Chinese tablets that delight</font> </h2><br>  The bright and reliable <a href="http://www.jd.ru/181469.html">Colorfly G708 tablet went</a> on <a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/cDUrj6Bakwy4oJI.html">sale</a> <a href="http://www.jd.ru/181469.html">again</a> - on a <a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/cDUrj6Bakwy4oJI.html">flash sale</a> its price will be only <b>5</b> cents ( <b>$ 0.05</b> ) (from November 25 to 30).  On a 7-inch board - an eight-core MT6592 1.3 GHz, Android 4.4 operating system, 1 GB RAM, built-in - 8 GB, with the possibility of expansion up to 32 GB.  The tablet works in 3G networks, and it can be used as a regular smartphone for talking - today it‚Äôs already true no matter what format a shovel is at the ear.  The battery is normal - 3000 mAh.  Despite the fairly discreet TTX, the tablet has a great advantage - a bright design and a special non-slip surface.  It is very cool in the hand, it does not even fall from the glass and polished table, it does not roll down from the sofa - in general, accidentally breaking it every 10 times is more difficult than any other. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/8ad/d5f/780/8add5f7804f548de05d28469f7f69e0a.jpg"></div><br>  Another tablet - <a href="http://www.jd.ru/304232.html">Aoson R12</a> , Russian version on Windows 8.1 (successfully updated to Windows 10).  At first glance, there is nothing supernatural in the tablet: 32 GB of internal memory with the ability to expand up to 64 GB, 2 GB of RAM, work on Wi-Fi, does not support SIM, IPS-screen is 10.1 inches.  But it is distinguished, first of all, by the processor - Intel Baytrail-Z3735F, 4 cores, which allows you to quickly start and run not only familiar applications, but even loaded games (there is also a role played by the graphics adapter Intel HD Graphics).  A 5000 mAh battery with OTG support is also not an odd thing and guarantees autonomy.  Finally, the pre-installed MS Office - turned on and work.  By the way, the impression is really made that the tablet is ideal for displaying documents at small business meetings - they do not slow down, they are displayed normally, and it is more pleasant to browse slides or tables interactively than to rustle printouts.  <b>$ 98.99</b> - the price of the sale from November 25 to 30 (base $ 133.99). <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/0fa/b45/9c7/0fab459c7c6c39693bdc45a68d52addc.jpg"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">Peripherals and Input</font> </h2><br>  The <a href="http://www.jd.ru/622255.html">Rapoo V20S / V210</a> gaming optical <a href="http://www.jd.ru/622255.html">mouse</a> will appeal not only to players, but also to any office worker - it is responsive, rather massive, the training fits comfortably under the arm - the palm on it is not ‚Äúhunched‚Äù, but almost rests.  Let us reveal the secret - during the black-Friday <b>flash sale</b> from November 25 to 30 it <b>will cost only $ 20.45</b> , so for now, put it in Favorites and do not forget to return to it on November 25.  The mouse is very ergonomic - the embossed wheel and anti-slip inserts securely fix the fingers.  Wire braided, not bent, does not crack.  Available in 7 DPI modes (500-3000), which can be adjusted directly with the mouse button.  The manufacturer promises a lifetime of 20 million clicks.  Once on Habr√©, developers believed that they made 4000 clicks a day.  This means the Rapoo mouse will last for 5,000 days, that is, for 13 years of continuous work.  Well, there it‚Äôs not a sin to change for a new one.  The players, of course, the resource will develop faster. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/dec/682/de4/dec682de4f524423fb4b097693aa4f62.jpg"></div><br>  For lovers of wireless and light mice there is a fellow of the same company - the wireless optical <a href="http://www.jd.ru/622254.html">mouse Rapoo M218</a> , which on a <b>flash sale will cost $ 8.27.</b>  The resolution is 1000 DPI, it weighs 55 grams. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1c8/5d7/622/1c85d7622fd94a298cb503c67aea38ac.png"></div><br>  From the pleasant sales trivia - <a href="http://www.jd.ru/199605.html">USB flash drive EAGET V90</a> , which at a <b>flash-sale</b> <b>will cost $ 9.82</b> (attention, we are talking about 16 GB).  Firstly, it is metal, moisture resistant and shockproof.  Secondly, it works quickly and stably: read speed is 26.8 MB / s, records - 6.99 MB / s (who need benchmarks - they are on the product page).  Nuance - when ordering can come with a ring, and maybe with a chain, which can always be replaced with a key ring or a key ring. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/537/dbc/db0/537dbcdb07fdf773dc5ecf39521858d9.jpg"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">Music in your ears</font> </h2><br>  On this Black Friday, both in the JD Collection and other vendors, there will be a lot of offers for audio devices: headphones and speakers. <br><br>  For example, in the JD Collection there are <a href="http://www.jd.ru/159133.html">SOMIC G923 / G925</a> soft headband <a href="http://www.jd.ru/159133.html">headphones</a> (the future price is from November 25th to November 30th at a <b>$ 16.56</b> <b>flash-sale</b> ).  High-quality headphones, comfortable, perfectly transmit the sound - suitable for gamers, music lovers, and masters to chat on Skype for hours.  The performance characteristics are not so impressive, but they give a clear impulse to the purchase, even to those who like to try something in the playlist: impedance is 32 Ohm, frequency range is 15-20000 Hz, 2.3 m wire, sensitivity is -40 dB + - 3 dB.  And in general - 904 reviews for 5 stars say something, the product is really worthy. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9d4/36d/9e6/9d436d9e6099fcc962ac5ca8498dae40.jpg"></div><br>  The headphones of another category are <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1224986.html">capsules with a XIAOMI microphone</a> (they will be on a <b>flash sale of</b> <b>$ 13.99</b> ).  Compatible with Android and iPhone, with good sound and an interesting position in the ears (by the way, reliable - you can run in the gym).  The sensitivity is 93 dB, the impedance is 32 Ohms, the maximum power is 5 mW, the range of reproducible frequencies is 20 - 20000 Hz, the cable length is 1.25 m. In general, this is another high-quality MI-thing. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/c05/b90/169/c05b90169c0ed7fbe0e3406a2466acac.jpg"></div><br>  Well, the device is more powerful - a sound system in a wooden (eco-friendly MDF) <a href="http://www.jd.ru/491602.html">Dostyle SD206 2.0 package</a> .  It will cost a nice amount of <b>$ 27.77 on a flash sale.</b>  .  The speakers are compact - only 10x10x16 cm. You should not expect studio sound, a dance floor and an explosion on all 9 or 20 floors of your house from them - but for chamber listening, that‚Äôs necessary.  From the speakers there is no unpleasant rattling, unnecessary vibrations and other whistling and hissing - only a clear, intelligible sound, which is good for watching a movie, and for home fitness, and even for giving (for such a price you don‚Äôt mind!).  Peak power - 8 watts, the frequency range of 80 - 18000 Hz.  From the pleasant moments - there is a function of magnetic shielding, therefore, the characteristic crackle from the nearby cell phones is almost imperceptible.  And yes, they really are very beautiful and well made. <br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/9dc/d9c/c7c/9dcd9cc7c9aef6d7a86d46a5e6af82da.jpg"></div><br><h2>  <font color="#c30023">For the most and not the smallest</font> </h2><br>  If your teenager is still not quite begging for his smart watches, then you can look at the very low-end model of <a href="http://www.jd.ru/1267545.html">Watch Phone Mate</a> .  A good watch on the MTK6260 processor, a 1.44-inch display and a modest 230 mAh battery (about a charge once a day).  The menu supports the Russian language, working in the cold.  The gadget is synchronized via the application with most popular smartphones, in the case of Android, it synchronizes SMS and controls the camera, while in the rest it notifies you of incoming calls.  Also in the clock there is an anti-theft - they vibrate and give a beep if the associated smartphone is removed more than meters.  And of course, the traditional sport set: time, calories, distance, steps.  By the way, all sports parameters are not transferred to the application and are displayed only on the clock, this, of course, is a minus for those who carefully monitor their health and build themselves different schedules.  The watch is fastened very securely with the help of a classic buckle.  Comes in three stylish colors: discreet red, white, black.  Honestly, very good stuff for <b>$ 7.99</b> .  If there are no special image goals and show off, you can take it yourself. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/1a8/4dc/bd5/1a84dcbd51b1c4d047500b2df824d929.jpg"></div><br>  Well, as always, we have - a lot of activities in social networks - all on <a href="http://sale.jd.ru/act/cDUrj6Bakwy4oJI.html">the promotion page</a> .  And in our public <a href="https://vk.com/jd">VKontakte</a> we play the new ultrabook Xiaomi Air 13.3. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/bb9/3e9/1ee/bb93e91ee9029fdc8053cbda75780e52.png"><br>  <i>By the way, in China itself, this ultrabook has a big shortage - it is quite difficult to find it on sale, it is so popular and is selling off quickly.</i>  <i>Our team managed to get one - how to tear it off.</i> <br><br>  Especially it is worth paying attention to those who make a large order.  The rules are: <br>  1. Make any order on the site <a href="http%253A%252F%252FJD.ru%26post%3D-94357549_245893">JD.ru from 21 to 29 November</a> <br>  2. To publish the publication and ask for real friends repost <br>  The winner will be determined by the formula: Order amount * (Number of reposts * 0.5) - no random reels or randomness.  All the details are in public. <br><br>  Soon the New Year - you can still have time to order a gift, but at the same time it's time to think about a series of early spring holidays - February 14, February 23, March 8.  However, this black Friday is enough for everyone, regardless of taste and wishes. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/398805/">https://habr.com/ru/post/398805/</a></p>
