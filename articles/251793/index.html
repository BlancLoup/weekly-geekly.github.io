  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Programming Philosophy 5 - Hummingbirds and Reactos</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Who can copy, he knows how to DO.  That said Leonardo da Vinci.  You see, you proceed from your ideas about what XP is, Windows, OS.  People like reason: <br><br>  - I was still a few years old, I had XP, so there were golden days, but now it‚Äôs not something that happened just now.  New times, modern software.  I do not understand why dig in junk?  You should at least make a clone of the tenth Windows, but where with your speed, you will make it in 100 years. <br><br>  But if people copy old software, this does not mean that they are retrogrades or necrophilia.  First, they are doing it now, being in modern conditions, knowing all the trends and directions.  Secondly, the obsolescence of software in general is extremely counter-intuitive.  For example, in the most modern applications there are pieces of code written over twenty years ago, and note that no one is going to rewrite them.  This is information, it does not wear out, like metal or wood wear.  But people tend to their everyday perception to translate into intangible things and require a completely different view.  Do you understand?  Information.  This is not a thing.  Compare with the poems of Pushkin. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Now everything is changing rapidly, at least there is a feeling in people that everything is changing rapidly, not least imposed by advertising, and the needs of soft-building companies in new revenues.  We are still only at the beginning of the software period of history.  We look at it all like children are opening their mouths and dumbfounded.  We still can not evaluate down and place the estimates.  With decades and centuries, the picture will start to appear, and most likely it will turn out that a lot of code written in the late twentieth century will live and live like Pushkin‚Äôs verses.  Because this is information, and if the algorithm is invented, the code is debugged and optimized, tested and tested by time - to change it, it will be as difficult to improve as "I remember a wonderful moment."  What will you change?  Wonderful change to the "modern" word?  "I liked the epic event"?

      Then, I personally, and you can throw stones at me for it, I consider it a manifestation of a low culture, in general, with high people who write open source.  This should be recognized as bad form.  All these ‚Äúyes to whom it is necessary‚Äù, ‚Äúyou would have found a better job‚Äù, ‚Äúyou have nothing more to do‚Äù.  This is a dead end, the path to nowhere.  It is impossible with people opening in Russia a new direction of civilization - open source, so to talk.  It is the same as beating the ‚Äúliterate‚Äù face.  And for that, but very smart, and you plowed up the field.  Programmers generally need to be respected, as engineers were revered in the late 19th century, as pilots in the early 20s, as entrepreneurs in the late 1980s and early 1990s. <br><br>  If a person writes a program that you personally do not need, of course you have nothing to thank him for.  But spit in the face why?  Why all these ‚Äúguys know a lot about perversions‚Äù, ‚Äúyou are doing nonsense‚Äù, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see any practical use‚Äù, ‚Äúpractically no one needs‚Äù.  I understand, if people painted graffiti on the wall of your five-story building, and you don‚Äôt like this graffiti.  You can be indignant, because you have to look at it every day, your children, maybe it seems ugly to you.  But soft?  What is there to resent?  Nobody forces you to use it, even reading an article about it is not necessary.  You may think it is ugly, useless, but why tell a programmer in a boorish style about this?  Rustic kind of motivation: I do not understand - harassment.  What for?  And so it was not necessary!  There is nothing here to write (code) any crap.  Self-affirmation?  What is it?  Critics, do you even wonder why you criticize? <br><br>  I understand that a person wrote a wry comment, threw in minuses and pinched five people.  But this is an episode, closed - forgotten.  But software people write for years.  You have thrown a piece of turd into a person, and he is alive and he still has to live and work further on this ‚Äúuseless software‚Äù.  A useless software can not be useful if you do not continue to work on it.  Long, tedious, free.  Change the behavior model.  The next time you see the article ‚Äúthe new version of our ugly useless software has become even uglier and useless, and the main thing is not clear why it is necessary‚Äù, do not rush to write in the comments ‚ÄúI agree, complete crap‚Äù.  Take a different tone.  Imagine that people invent something, work, find something in it, and maybe it is YOU who do not understand something.  Feel free to talk about what people know more about (since they have been working on it for years, it is logical to assume that they are at least in the subject).  Pat on the shoulder, cheer up, write a bug report.  Find something good.  It always is.  Be respectful. <br><br>  On the website for programmers, an article from the programmer about his free project, this is the crown, this is the aristocracy, this is the cutting edge.  You poison them.  They must be exalted.  They should be stylistically allocated for Habr√©, photos of the authors should be kept in beautiful fashion frames on the board of honor.  All well done, and who translated the article from English, and who is promoting the company in which it works, and who wants to share about lambda on Haskele.  But finally admit it - a person who represents a new (or first) version of his open-source software project in Habr√© - this should be the most respected person, and his article should receive maximum respect.  This event!  This is a sensation!  Among the confused, busy, unintelligent, not finding time, imagining themselves to be elves in Zhuderdale - the authors of real projects appear.  You are wriggling like a country girl at a physics teacher who ‚Äúspoils children ‚Äî they began to read a lot‚Äù.  Let them be the most useless programs in the world, let them be ugly, let them as far as the heavens to the best Western models - they still need to be watered, undead, cherished and cherished.  Blow off dust particles.  These people must be heroes, and you yourself are ‚Äúnot understanding-nafigononad‚Äù, climb into the heroes and assert themselves.  You should be ashamed, not them. <br><br>  Moreover, it is worth noting that the authors of all such projects usually have everything in order with the culture.  They are led by dozens of idiotic komentov, but they themselves are the most polite always.  The man who knows how to work, he already knows how to respect.  To spit in the face, it is not only a sign of lack of culture, it is first and foremost a sign of a non-understanding person.  Not able to estimate labor costs, assess the degree of competence.  Most of the comments on Reactos come from people who are not even able to distinguish the OS kernel from the file manager shell.  And these people do not consider themselves fools, they consider the authors of Reaktos to be fools.  How much can you put up with it?  So these people need to speak bluntly - behave yourself.  Keep quiet in a decent society.  Do not spit in respected people.  And point the finger at the authors of the Reaktos, Hummingbird - here they are - DEAR.  The same is done in the village.  The men gather their fools by their ears, and say: ‚ÄúThis ridiculous bespectacled man, whom you have showered with rotten eggs, is the Physics Teacher - Dear person.  Once again I will see that you are not behaving badly with him - not only will you get over the ears, but I will pick up with a wrench, you will run like a scalded one ‚Äù.  Minor commentators should get used to the pot, understand that they are the last people in the programmer community.  Bottoms.  And always look around, adults notice their dirty tricks or not.  Disbanded. <br><br>  Of course, democracy is freedom, everyone can say what he wants.  But you can tell him.  A person spoiled in comments, - his right, but our right to tell him - you shit, enough shit, learn to respect the work of people.  And the man is offended.  I shat, but I'm not a shit, you shit yourself.  And to confirm, it takes its own freshly shit and throws it in the face of the programmer.  Look, I'm telling you, you are a shit. <br><br>  I repeat, the majority of these ‚Äúclever things‚Äù come from people who ask higher in the same branch something like ‚Äúis it possible to run HALO-3 on Hummingbirds‚Äù?  Yeah.  And these people feel in the discussion of the masters.  They are on the dedicated website of the community of programmers, trampling the elite of this community and consider themselves masters.  Clownery.  And their main argument over and over again is ‚ÄúI don't understand.‚Äù  Where are the bright times in which misunderstanding is considered the sin of one who does not understand?  "Neponimyki." <br><br>  You see, there are things that humanity releases in single copies.  Well, dozens sometimes.  Let's say a new model of a fighter, a new space rocket, a new great war, a crusade.  A new discovery in physics.  Human scale events.  In terms of the level of ALL humanity.  And the creation of operating systems is such a level.  Not the pygmies with their batons judge these GIANTS.  "There is no place for a fire in your rocket."  The man opened up at his dacha, made a toilet, then came home and lounged to criticize the Superjet: ‚ÄúFu gosh rashkovanskoe, not like Boeing.‚Äù  You, asshole, compare not the Superjet with the Boeing, but your toilet with the Superjet.  Compare, swallow tears and continue to compare, feel - who you are, and what you can judge and what not. <br><br>  People made a supercar in Muhosransk, where there were only two drunken locksmiths, and he is only two times worse than Ferrari or Lamborghini.  Well, that is, not up to 500 accelerates, but only up to 300, and weighs 100 kg more.  Bukhie locksmith came and set fire to "competitors".  Freaks, come up with something, supercars do.  And here we squeal on tire.  Understand the fundamental nature of the problem. <br><br>  Even if they never fit, all these open projects, never at all.  But among us are growing people, with a capital letter.  Cosmic beings, they swipe to the top, fit in to the stars.  The fact that a person personally uses the OS or an editor or an audio player gives him an erroneous feeling that he can judge the author, that he understands better.  Writers, filmmakers are also judged.  As reasoned: once I can read, then I can and authoritatively attach.  Deceptive sensation of intimacy.  You have in your dirtier room in a hruscheb among the rubbish that has been accumulating for years and which you have not been given to disassemble, there is a computer, a Windows computer, and you think that on this basis you can discuss the author of Reaktos, for example.  This is how the brain works. <br><br>  Let the authors of open projects live, work, receive our encouragement and approval, let them grow, they should be watched and they should be loved as cinema stars and big figures.  Our future life largely depends on them.  When you get on a plane and catch a glimpse of the captain of the aircraft, will you spit in his face, will you criticize him?  Your life depends on it.  You should bow to him in the legs, and you bow, there means an understanding. <br><br>  Therefore, remember the words of Leonardo - who knows how to copy, he knows how to do.  Someday, Russian programmers will thunder and be glorified in the best possible way, some incredible beautiful programs, creators and organizers will be released, and I am sure that we will greet them and ask: how did you become such a great programmer?  The little man will quietly, politely, intelligently say ‚Äúyes, that you, we just work, and we started in the Hummingbird, (Reactos)‚Äù.  Or even cooler ‚ÄúYes, I was taught by great teachers, those who once worked on Reactos, they are people, undeservedly forgotten geniuses, but I am just their student to the best of my ability.‚Äù  And now, everything is turned upside down - at the top there is a savory sarcastic cattle, and at the bottom a spattered ELITE - the authors of open projects, despised and disrespectful.  And the programmers themselves should begin, show an example, in their offices and cubicles, smart, well-read, but not capable of waving open source, and often dreaming about it.  That you should be the first and remind others - open source, this is the level, it is honor and respect.  The fact that only one out of a hundred, at best, of such projects is really needed by people and will take off, this is normal. <br><br>  Start your projects, do not be afraid, yes, they peck up you, they will spit, but it's all not true.  The truth is yours.  Be creative, develop, write about your work, let the public know.  Sooner or later, the topic will be broken, people realize that you are writing open source, pushing a project, and this is above all - the most respected occupation. <br><br>  <b>Programming philosophy</b> <br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/254531/">6: Product and Project</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/251793/">5: Reactos and Hummingbirds</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/249839/">4: Chapito Technology</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/247619/">3: Chichikov and programmer</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/247363/">2: Myth and Language</a> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/247251/">1: Three-way programming</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/251793/">https://habr.com/ru/post/251793/</a></p>
