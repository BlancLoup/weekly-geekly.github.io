  <section class="page js-page"><h1>BlackBerry: you can continue to count on us</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  At the moment, BlackBerry is experiencing very serious problems - no one liked their first flagship phone, one of the co-founders made a bet on a dark horse to buy out the company, and the company itself can be divided between the bidders offering the highest prices.  So what to do to this, once the dominant player in the smartphone market in the light of these vague and oppressive forecasts?  What can the company do to support loyal BlackBerry fans watching their friends and colleagues moving to other platforms? <br><br>  It's hard to say, but at the moment, BlackBerry plans to calm people down in an old-fashioned way - with an open letter, the Waterloo company published a message to people in 30 newspapers in nine countries explaining why it is not worth writing off the company. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a2f/2f4/633/a2f2f46330dc51fd198626664c3ef2e6.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a>

      You can read the full text of the letter at the end of the article, but you can hardly find anything new in it.  Lack of debt, cash reserves and vast experience in providing productive mobile computing for secure corporate environments.  A well-founded position, with the possible exception of the team's praise for BBM‚Äôs popularity as a global social messaging platform.  Its initial launch for iOS and Android did not go according to plan - almost three weeks have passed since the app appeared in the respective app stores, and still, there is not a word about when the BlackBerry opens its doors again. <br><br>  It is also curious that the letter was signed by the BlackBerry team and not, say, by director Torsten Heins.  This clearly indicates that no one person can be blamed for the current precarious position of the company, as well as that the future of the company lies entirely on the shoulders of a single person.  Of course, in a short time, this team will have to decrease, since by the end of the year 4,500 people are waiting for dismissal.  All this is done, ostensibly, for the common good, but there is no guarantee that the company's cost-cutting measures will be enough to lead the platform to victory. <br><br><blockquote>  To our dear customers, partners and fans. <br><br>  You've undoubtedly seen BlackBerry news.  And you are probably wondering what they mean to you, one of the tens of millions of users who count on BlackBerry every day. <br><br>  We have one important message for you: <br><br>  You can still rely on the BlackBerry. <br><br>  How do we know?  We have a large stock of cash and no debt. <br><br>  We are conducting a reorganization, which aims to reduce costs by 50% to create a very efficient, consumer-oriented organization. <br><br>  Without a doubt, these are difficult times for us and we cannot underestimate the situation or ignore the challenges.  We make the necessary complex changes to strengthen the BlackBerry. <br><br>  The only thing that we will never change is our commitment to those of you who help make BlackBerry the most reliable tool for global business professionals. <br><br>  And speaking of headlines, we can celebrate our achievements in several areas. <br><br>  Best-in-class productivity tools <br>  ... <br>  Better security <br>  ... <br>  Better Mobile Device Management for Businesses <br>  ... <br>  Best Mobile Social Network <br>  ... <br><br>  Yes, there are many competitors and we understand that BlackBerry is not for everyone.  This is normal.  You have always known that the BlackBerry is different, and that can distinguish you.  Countless important decisions, transactions and critical negotiations were made using the BlackBerry.  And for many of you this connection, this connection lasted for more than a decade. <br><br>  We believe in BlackBerry - in our people, in our technology and ability to adapt.  More importantly, we believe in you.  Every day we focus on what will help you take care of your business. <br><br>  You trust your BlackBerry in delivering the most important messages, believe our own message: you can continue to count on us. <br><br>  Respectfully, <br>  Team blackberry </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/197732/">https://habr.com/ru/post/197732/</a></p>
