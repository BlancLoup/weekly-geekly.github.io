  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Matt threatens new algorithm again</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5f8/6eb/c4c/5f86ebc4c34a17c552c6090eeb1777b3.jpg" alt="image" align="right"><br>  Due to the specifics of our product, the <a href="https://paysto.com/">Paysto</a> team <a href="https://paysto.com/">is</a> constantly interested in new trends and proposed changes in the field of SEO, and in particular, the algorithm of the search engines.  While working on the previous <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/paysto/blog/222921/">article</a> , while viewing the mass of video messages from Matt Cutts, a specialist working in the group that develops the quality of Google search, we came across a video that perhaps Google is once again planning to change the algorithm for ranking sites.  According to Matt, when creating a new algorithm, they tried to maximize the possibility of taking into account social factors when forming a rating of a resource. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Google specialists have set themselves the task of separating simply popular sites from really useful ones.  One of the leading roles begins to play a concept that can be called "authority" of the site.  Apparently, the search giant seeks to ensure that a simple number of clicks on the site no longer have a significant value: the utility factor is put in the first place, how often users use your content and share it with others, i.e.  it all comes down to the frequency of quoting. <br><br>  The overall result of all that has been said can be reduced to one phrase ‚Äúthose who are accustomed to perceive the rating of a site as popular will be very disappointed.‚Äù  ‚ÄúLet's look at porn sites: they are really very popular, but at the same time people practically do not refer to them.  On the other hand, if you take the official websites of the state of Wisconsin, you will not see the huge popularity of these sites, but many people refer to their material. ‚Äù <br><br>  Matt continues to develop the idea that attendance ceases to play a major role: "Today popularity is measured by attendance, while PageRank is more likely a reputation criterion."  Google claims that it can separate popularity from credibility and optimize search results, depending on the criteria of a particular query.

        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"
          data-ad-slot="8945601208"></ins>
        <script>
          (adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
        </script>
      <br>
      Of course, reputation is crucial.  It is worth using every opportunity to establish yourself as an expert in a particular area or market niche and not only so that your site has high positions in the search results.  ‚ÄúYou have to think not only about popularity and creating something like reputation.  You can establish yourself as a specialist in the field of medical care, travel or something else. "  At the same time, Matt stresses that "we will see that you (your material) are benefiting, and links to you appear in thematic content." <br><br>  In addition, Cutts argues that Google plans to increase the influence of such factors as the sophistication of sites with links to your content.  Ie, what is the specialization of the site, on the open spaces of which a link to your content is placed, and the more this specialization meets the orientation of your materials, the more important this link will be.  Mat admits that it is "difficult but entertaining." <br><br>  ‚ÄúWe are actually working on changes in the algorithm, which would allow us to state that this site is more responsive to a specific request than any other.  And I look forward to when this algorithm will be implemented, because a lot of people have worked hard on it and it will make the search results really optimal. ‚Äù <br><br>  Unfortunately, Matt does not specify when the algorithm will be implemented in the system, but he hints that webmasters need to take this information into account. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/PfLaC325S6M%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700021,15700186,15700190,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiic-j96sEvgy0hln_C3vc4amuijg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br><h5>  What should be afraid? </h5><br><br>  Of particular interest is the reaction of the Internet community to this statement: <br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúNow Google determines who has‚Äú real ‚Äùauthority, and who doesn't.  So why don't they deprive all authors of the ‚Äúprivileges‚Äù of content, which is that Google displays part of the G + profile in the search results.  Surprisingly, Matt's profile picture is obsessively demonstrated in the results.  This is really disgusting.  Someone on Google really needs to seriously appreciate the damage from this guy. ‚Äù </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  ‚ÄúThis will be a disaster for the‚Äú little ‚Äùguys who offer high quality content.  Google, you must seriously develop an algorithm for sorting content before it is implemented. " </blockquote><br><br>  Indeed, everything looks as if the new algorithm will deal a huge blow to young sites, and pages as advertising media in general.  After all, if your site contains only information about your product and its features, you should not expect a high level of natural links on other resources.  At the same time, connecting the thematic blog will not save the situation much either.  It remains to hope that they can actually implement the algorithm that makes the search results optimal and asking about payment instruments on the Internet, you will receive a link to Paysto, and not to the website with legislation on payment transactions on the Internet. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223167/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223167/</a></p>
