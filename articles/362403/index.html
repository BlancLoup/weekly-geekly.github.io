  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Test and comparison of robots-vacuum cleaners Neato, iClebo, Clever'n'Clean, Kitfort, LG</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> Robot vacuum cleaner - a dream of a lazy and zealous owner, who is sorry for the time for cleaning.  In any case, the robot vacuum cleaner is the current trend, the number of models sold is huge, it‚Äôs not so easy to choose something, and there are very few independent tests from those who are not interested in promoting specific brands.  For a month, my colleague and I used six models from popular manufacturers at home, and then tested them under the same conditions.  Somewhere we could make mistakes or not notice something, but, in general, our results reflect the real experience of using real people.  Test results and impressions - below.  iRobot was taken to the test just now, the impressions on it a little later, beyond the general test. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd3/c39/001/bd3c39001f21427fb46ecdf44d28f041.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  <b>Testing method</b> <br>  We prepared a small room and covered the floor with exhibition carpet so as not to create additional difficulties for vacuum cleaners.  In the room we scatter a strictly defined amount of the prepared material that simulates pollution.  This material is perfectly visible in the ultraviolet spectrum.  In our garbage: paper pellets of different sizes, dust and the smallest remnants of fabric, scraps of threads.  Real trash is a real challenge.  We will not scatter rice, as others do, real garbage clings to the carpet, and rice can be removed with a broom, and it is useless to scatter food.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/644/22f/79a/64422f79ab87404ca0315744f2300424.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/907/92a/b3d/90792ab3d3bf494d93ec26374409de14.jpg"><br><br>  In vacuum cleaners in which this was possible, the method of moving a zigzag was established.  After cleaning the vacuum cleaner, we turn on the UV lamp and look at what may not have removed the vacuum cleaner.  To get closer to real conditions, we will put a chair, an obstacle of indefinite form and, with a separate test, simulate irregularities and completely accidentally forget on the floor of the wire.  Before launching a new robot cleaner, carefully clean the room and fall asleep new trash.  The last stage is the duration of one battery charge.  We protected the technical area with our equipment with magnetic tapes and virtual walls from a set of vacuum cleaners. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca1/05a/3df/ca105a3df9f94734a66918337e9663c0.jpg"><br><br>  For cleaning the device receives an estimate on a 100-point scale, depending on the percentage of the cleaned.  The rest of the tests are 10 points, the scores are summarized to get the final one.  Well, now let's take a closer look at the tested devices. <br><br>  <b>Participating models</b> <br>  <b>1. YUJIN Robot iClebo Arte YCR-M05-20 Silver</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/712/f5c/82b/712f5c82bfe84e0aaf27851f7ad320fc.jpg"><br><br>  iClebo Arte gets an idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe room, examining not the floor of the room, but its ceiling.  For this, there is a camera on the surface.  The device is equipped with two brushes for cleaning the corners and one turbo brush.  To limit the operation of the vacuum cleaner to a certain area, you need to put on the floor a special magnetic tape.  The real average noise level in the room when the device is ~ 58 dB.  The volume of the container for collecting dust - 600 ml.  The price is about 20,000 rubles. <br><br>  <b>2. Clever &amp; lean Z-Series (White Moon)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/309/d62/57d/309d6257d6454cb6b024b382a4a97d18.jpg"><br><br>  The Clever &amp; lean Z-Series manual states: "Never use a vacuum cleaner to clean wet surfaces / carpets."  It should be understood that he does not clean the carpets, but this is not so, as we have seen, with the carpets of the robot everything is in order.  The robot has two main brushes - a fleecy and rubber and one corner brush.  On the other hand, instead of a brush, there is an ultraviolet lamp designed to sterilize the surface.  You can limit the cleaning area with the help of a virtual wall, the obstacle beam is picked up by sensors and the vacuum cleaner does not cross the virtual barrier.  The real noise level in the room when the device is ~ 58 dB.  The volume of the garbage container - 400 ml, the price is about 11,000 rubles <br><br>  <b>3. Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/f18/00b/502/f1800b502c254ab283a9086b4382c866.jpg"><br><br>  The second representative of Clever &amp; Clean is the easiest vacuum cleaner of today's test: it doesn‚Äôt stand up for charging on its own, it doesn‚Äôt even have a charging station, there isn‚Äôt even a big brush like other vacuum cleaners, only angular ones.  In principle, this may well be enough to remove our unpretentious exhibition carpet that the test will show.  Noise ~ 60 dB, the volume of an uncomfortable container is only 150 Ml.  The cost is about 5,000 rubles. <br><br>  <b>4. NEATO Botvac 85</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/2cb/026/578/2cb026578b5c40168db4eab4c98d0efe.jpg"><br><br>  NEATO Botvac 85, the most powerful vacuum cleaner in the Botvac series.  The device makes a map of the room based on the readings of the laser scanner, is controlled by the actual CPU and OS.  That is really a robot.  The device has an unusual shape, it is not completely round as competitors.  The manufacturer claims that the vacuum cleaner cleans the corners better.  Neato practically does not get confused and does not fall into the "trap".  Some vacuum cleaners climb into the niches from which they cannot get out, but in difficult situations Botvac 85 tries to raise the case above the floor in order to reduce its area or overcome an obstacle.  The main combined brush occupies almost the entire width of the vacuum cleaner.  Restrict movement of the robot can be magnetic tape.  Noise on average ~ 62 dB.  The trash bin is very convenient and the most voluminous - 700 ml (more only for iRobot, which does not participate in the test).  The price of the tested model is about 30,000 rubles. <br><br>  <b>5. LG Hom-Bot Square VR6270LVM</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/569/329/bc2/569329bc236e4ffb8f45b88b79af05fd.jpg"><br><br>  The second is not a round vacuum cleaner in the dough and, as the name implies, it is square.  What the form will give, we will see during testing, but for now, we can say that LG Hom-Bot Square requires increased attention.  Stuck - requires release, lost the charging station - requires to find it and stuff like that.  Screaming too loud voice, he can in the middle of the night, which is absolutely disgusting.  However, the speech of the vacuum cleaner in Russian, the voice of a woman is pleasant, someone will like it all, absolutely for sure.  The positioning of the vacuum cleaner help two cameras, one upper, second lower with illumination.  Two side brushes and one main brush are removed.  The vacuum cleaner well absorbs garbage in a convenient container of vertical loading with a volume of 600 ml.  In general, the convenience of working with this vacuum cleaner at a height, in the right places pasted instructions.  Unless there are no ways to restrict its movement - there is neither a tape nor a virtual wall, but this vacuum cleaner is quieter than everyone else.  The noise in the room is ~ 52 dB, the dust collector is about 600 ml, the cost is about 20,000 rubles. <br><br>  <b>6. Kitfort KT-501</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/03b/310/54e/03b31054e2f34b469e825a65cd6dd1c9.jpg"><br><br>  And the last representative is Kitfort.  The characteristics of this vacuum cleaner look attractive, there is almost everything that the more expensive competitors have a cleaning program, a schedule, and even an ultraviolet lamp, like the older ‚ÄúClover and Maple‚Äù a.  In this case, the cost is less than 10,000 rubles.  In fact - a vacuum cleaner with a rather mediocre navigation.  But, it should be noted that he did not demand increased attention to himself, but was cleaned qualitatively.  Sorry, the capacity of the dust collector is small - about 350 ml.  Noise device at ~ 58 dB. <br><br>  <b>Test</b> <br><br>  <b>Phase 1. Cleaning.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/ca4/baf/5df/ca4baf5dfcf447feae109765efb0f51a.jpg"><br>  <i>Test room with scattered contaminating material</i> <br><br>  The pictures below show the results of cleaning each of the vacuum cleaners and the worked out trajectories (do not pay attention to the speed in the lower left corner). <br><br>  <b>iClebo Arte</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/281/a4f/364/281a4f3642c24a248197ef91bc6ff8ab.jpg"><br><br>  iClebo Arte immediately showed that not everything is so rosy.  Small garbage, especially scraps of threads, the vacuum cleaner collects badly, some part just smears on the carpet.  For 100% cleaning you will need one more, or even two passes.  The vacuum cleaner is set to zig-zag.  The device sometimes skips bands, but returns and collects trash.  Positioning iClebo Arte arte in the room, helps the built-in gyroscope.  It took the vacuum cleaner 8 minutes to collect 75% of the garbage.  In this category iCLEBO gets 7.5 points.  For orientation in the room - 9 points. <br><br>  <b>Clever &amp; lean Z-Series (White Moon)</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/da5/4d4/a46/da54d4a464514ab18e4092947c87e3dc.jpg"><br><br>  Clever &amp; clean from the Z series decided to take out a room of 5 square meters, automatically cleared it for half an hour.  In the process of tracking the trajectory, we found that the vacuum cleaner was stuck for a long time in one place - it rested against a corner and tried to move the brick wall, not otherwise.  Then he also gets stuck in another corner.  Fighting with the wall, the vacuum cleaner is almost completely thinned, but it does not go for exercises until we help it.  Total Clever &amp; Clean was cleaned for almost 30 minutes and removed 92%, but the corners are poorly cleaned, but the floor at the baseboard is clean.  Note that the virtual wall, as a limiter, looks more preferable than a magnetic tape, there is always enough length.  And the vacuum cleaner is not trying to knock it down.  Cleaning - 9.2 points, orientation - 4. <br><br>  <b>Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/32b/b99/0ea/32bb990ea6b044af8d8c95ba8977ff69.jpg"><br><br>  As stated in the instructions, the vacuum cleaner Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series will work until the battery sits down, so we give it a maximum of as much as its older brother, at the same time let's see how the lack of a turbo brush will affect the quality of cleaning.  It should be recognized that Clever &amp; Clean M-series removes fine fragments of debris well, but it doesn‚Äôt have enough suction force that collects larger ones.  The trajectory - like the ball in the game Arkanoid.  Vacuum cleaner cheerfully cuts the same triangles.  The baseboard vacuum cleaner is removed poorly, leaving almost five centimeters intact.  So, in twenty-five minutes, a vacuum cleaner on an area of ‚Äã‚Äã5 square meters removed 85% of the garbage.  Let us assume that in large areas a vacuum cleaner will not be effective.  Cleaning - 8.5 points.  Orientation - 1 point. <br><br>  <b>NEATO Botvac 85</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/5ab/951/e00/5ab951e00e1f4cd08b2b5b87d0f35504.jpg"><br><br>  In general, ‚ÄúNeato‚Äù is programmed to bypass the perimeter first, and then to remove the remaining area with a zigzag.  But, we have too little space and Botvac 85, like other vacuum cleaning robots, fell in love with the chrome legs of the chair, and for some reason moved its own exercises.  It didn't work out around the perimeter from the first time, but Neato corrected everything later. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c07/ada/015/c07ada01518747f2a25b5d78b9ca7f65.jpg"><br>  <i>This is how Neato sees the world around him.</i> <br><br>  The device from the first pass removes a significant part of the garbage.  After cleaning, there are 2 intact spots.  Cleaning took 8 minutes, while this is the best result.  97% of garbage collected.  Cleaning - 9.7 points.  Orientation - 8 points. <br><br>  <b>LG Hom-Bot Square</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/d1f/7b4/1d6/d1f7b41d681e4d08894ce98f812faf14.jpg"><br><br>  "AlDzhi" the same as "Neato" and "iHlebo", works in zigzag mode.  He does pounce on the garbage, quickly driving through clean areas.  Yes, the device is moving very quickly, but, completes the cleaning, leaving untouched a huge area.  Removed 78%.  But where the vacuum cleaner was cleaned, it was cleaned very clean.  A vacuum cleaner doesn‚Äôt stand up as neatly as a Neato or iClebo on its own charging, but climbs like a fierce mustache lover on its striped passion.  Cleaning time - 5 minutes.  7.8 points - cleaning.  Orientation - 7 points. <br><br>  <b>Kitfort KT-501</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1b5/647/6c0/1b56476c0d52460a8d471e4eb5d63684.jpg"><br><br>  "Kote" most gently treated with our small furniture, and cleaned automatically in five minutes.  Enough trash left, but, in general, - not bad.  Our opinion is that the navigation algorithm is too simple, but unlike the Clever &amp; lean Z-Series, the vacuum cleaner finished cleaning without any problems and got up for charging.  Removed 78%.  The center is significantly better than at the edges.  Cleaning - 7.8 points, orientation - 6 points. <br><br>  <b>Phase 2. Overcoming obstacles.</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/685/910/b69/685910b699e4405a9469dbd92d5e76a2.jpg"><br><br>  <b>iClebo Arte</b> <br>  iClebo Arte moved the obstacle without any problems.  I managed the wires as well - I moved.  Such a vacuum cleaner can be left unattended.  10 points. <br><br>  <b>Clever &amp; lean Z-Series (White Moon)</b> <br>  At the first attempt, this vacuum cleaner did not move the obstacle, but turned around, returned and moved quite easily.  Wires the vacuum cleaner decided not to move and pulled over.  May be confused.  7 points. <br><br>  <b>Clever &amp; Clean 002 M-Series</b> <br>  For the simplest vacuum cleaner of our test, the obstacle in the form of a 12-millimeter board became insurmountable, just like a thick wire.  0 points. <br><br>  <b>NEATO Botvac 85</b> <br>  Directing NEATO where we want it is unrealistic, so we have limited our movement a little.  And he is not that moved the board, he vacuumed it!  With wires, he also does not stand on ceremony.  10 points. <br><br>  <b>LG Hom-Bot Square</b> <br>  I want to believe that the LG vacuum cleaner recognized the obstacle and decided to overcome it diagonally.  But he screwed the wires on himself and dragged him into a corner, where he finally got confused.  6 points. <br><br>  <b>Kitfort KT-501</b> <br>  Kitfort rushing like a tank, it is immediately obvious that for him 12 mm is far from the limit.  But with the wires, he did the same as LG, - dragged him into a corner, where he finally got confused.  6 points. <br><br>  <b>Test tables</b> <br>  Well, now three tables. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c4/086/9ab/4c40869abba6499489b3d9dc4e951001.jpg"><br>  <i>The results of the test battery life on a single battery charge.</i>  <i>iClebo is the champion, but Neato holds the charge the least.</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/139/1d9/653/1391d9653f6747b8820ca8c490f14355.jpg"><br>  <i>Cleaning table</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/523/7cb/41e/5237cb41e8dc4999aefd74d5bdae037b.jpg"><br>  <i>A summary table of all indicators, where we have distributed vacuum cleaners on a set of tests, in accordance with the occupied place.</i> <br><br>  It should be noted that for high-quality cleaning with the help of any robot vacuum cleaner, it is necessary to remove slippers, wires from charging and everything else that is usually lying on the floor.  As for the impressions of the iRobot Roomba 880, we will share them a little later, after a longer acquaintance with the vacuum cleaner.  For now, only the most capacious container and the presence of a pair of coordinators in the kit (not limiters, namely coordinators) can be noted. <br><br>  The same test in video format: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/WPBzju_Bd2c%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhhDYQJMOAU4b1jMxyrit8wUnpVNgw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  <b>In addition</b> <br><br>  <b>iClebo POP</b> <br>  After the preparation of this test, more than a year has passed, and during this time we managed to get acquainted with three more vacuum cleaner robots.  First, iClebo POP. <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/ERZvF_Zejj8%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=25657,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhgLKzRzDBZXYIyK4CdxyQYhna1qKQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br>  <i>A small video about him.</i>  <i>Watch from 5:30 <a href="https://youtu.be/ERZvF_Zejj8%3Ft%3D5m30s">youtu.be/ERZvF_Zejj8?t=5m30s</a></i> <br><br>  But we do not recommend this purchase in any way.  After one and a half months of use, a defect was revealed in the junction of the trash container and the body of the robot.  Perhaps the problem of our particular instance, but urge to be vigilant. <br><br>  <b>Samsung POWERBot VR9000</b> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bc0/282/81d/bc028281d41345dbaf2ec96156747222.jpg"><br><br>  We have just started to master the Samsung POWERBot VR9000 and have not carried out objective tests of the quality of cleaning using the same method as the previous vacuum cleaners.  However, subjectively, the quality of cleaning is not inferior to or surpasses Neato Botvac 85.  A powerful motor and a motorized turbo brush of proprietary shape show high efficiency in a bundle.  At the same time, the brush is less susceptible to winding on itself long hair, threads and similar pollutants, most of which still get into the container.  The robot adequately paves the route and quickly gets up for charging, which indicates a high-quality implementation of space orientation algorithms.  As part of convenience, the emptying of the container occurs without turning the robot and without removing the robot from charging, because  the container is on top.  Of the significant shortcomings at the moment, we were able to select only the price and limited availability in stores. <br><br>  UPD.
