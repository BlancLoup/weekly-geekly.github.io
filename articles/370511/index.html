But it is better because it works without heating elements and plastic that needs to be melted.  The consequence of this kind of work is not too pleasant smell, energy costs, the ability to get burned (of course, for this you need to be very sloppy). <br><br>  CreoPop 3D pen works with photopolymer instead of plastic, which hardens under the influence of ultraviolet radiation.  At the same time, there are several types of ink for such a pen, both simply colored and luminescent.  There are flavored photopolymers for CreoPop, elastic, magnetic - whatever. <br><br>  Photopolymer is supplied in special cartridges.  To get started, you just need to attach the cartridge to the handle and you can start creating.  The handle works wirelessly thanks to the built-in battery.  One cartridge with photopolymer is enough for 14 meters of a line approximately 3 mm wide. <br><br>  The pen <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/3d-ruchka-creopop/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Drasprodazha">can be ordered</a> from the Madrobots store.

Aqua farm itself is a closed ecosystem, the main elements of which are fish and plants.  Fish lives, eats, gives waste, which, in turn, are used by plants.  These plants purify the aquarium water, so a kind of symbiosis is obtained. <br><br>  You can grow both greens for the kitchen, and ordinary ornamental plants.  In order to start, you need to fill the pallets with a substrate for the plants, plant the plants themselves and fill the aquarium with water.  The aquafer still needs to be plugged in to a power outlet in order to ‚Äústart‚Äù the water circulation system. <br><br>  After that we put a fish into the water, which we don‚Äôt forget to feed.  By experience, the fish is better to keep one in the aquarium, then the ecosystem without any problems copes with the load. <br><br>  You can buy a farmhouse in <a href="http://madrobots.ru/p/akvaferma-aquafarm/%3Futm_source%3Dgeektimes.ru%26utm_medium%3Dpr%26utm_campaign%3Drasprodazha">Madrobots</a> .
