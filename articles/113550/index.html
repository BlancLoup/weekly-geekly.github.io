  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Meizu m9</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage/5d96e1ba/61a4d11e/65659771/50399982.jpg" align="left"><br>  As probably many of those who follow the mobile device market already know, not so long ago (namely, 01/01/2011), the sales of the obviously promising and already expected Chinese Meizu M9 began, which at a cost of $ 400 in the local market exceeds In many ways, there are already existing ‚Äútop‚Äù devices on the market, such as the same iPhone4 or HTC Desire. <br><br>  With this post, I expect to bring a little clarity about what this is all about, and I hope that it will be useful to those who are still thinking about purchasing or have already managed to order this wonderful device somewhere (but not without nuances). <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  So what do we actually have?  To begin, I will provide information from the wiki: <br><ul><li>  Screen: 16 million color 3.5-inch 960x640 resolution capacitive multi-touch display </li><li>  CPU / GPU: 1 GHz Samsung S5PC110 / PowerVR SGX 540 GPU </li><li>  Memory: 512 Mb RAM / 512 Mb ROM and MicroSDHC card slot up to 32GB </li><li>  Network Connectivity: Quad-band GSM / GPRS / EDGE / WCDMA / HSDPA / HSUPA </li><li>  Wireless Connectivity: WIFI / WAPI Ôºà802.11 b / g / nÔºâ and Bluetooth 2.1 + EDR </li><li>  Sensors: Gravity sensor, ambient light sensor, infrared distance sensor and electronic compass </li><li>  Positioning: GPS / A-GPS and electronic compass </li><li>  Video Formats: AVI, MP4, 3GP, MOV, MKV and FLV format </li><li>  Sound Formats: FLAC, APE, MP3, OGG, AMR, AAC and other formats </li><li>  Picture Formats: High-resolution JPG, PNG, BMP and GIF format </li><li>  Camera: 5 mega pixel, 720P HD recording, auto focus, touch focus and digital zoom </li><li>  Battery: 1370mAh lithium-polymer battery </li><li>  Ports: Mini USB2.0 high-speed stereo port and 3.5mm stereo headphone jack </li><li>  Dimensions / weight: 59.8 √ó 113.0 √ó 11.2mm / 123g </li></ul><br>  As you can see, everything is about the same as that of the other adequate representatives of the genre.  But a special mention here is given to a capacitive multitouch display, which, with its 640x960 by 3.5 inches, looks just as good as a retina (and according to some even better), what to say about 480x800 by 4.5 inches in Desire.  Yes, it is still glossy (will we wait until otherwise?), But for all the time I used it, I never had a desire to wipe it with a cloth, as was the case with iPhones and iPad.  By the way, a little about color rendering: except that visually all colors are juicy and bright, the white color on it looks really white, and the black one is a little lighter than the ideal!  But, unfortunately, it didn‚Äôt do without sadness: in the bright sun in hot weather the display noticeably fades. <br><br>  I will devote only a few lines to the appearance and convenience of placing the device in my hand: at last I could get a device that I like.  Strict, not too round and very, very black, in which fans of ThinkPads and plain T-shirts without inscriptions will surely understand me without difficulty.

      Due to the use of a pleasant and not so easily soft touch and slightly rounded edges in the back panel, the device conveniently lies in the hand and does not attempt to slip out of it.  All buttons (and there are some of them) are easily accessible for pressing with one hand, the one in which the device lies.  And this is good. <br><br>  The camera is completely bad.  Sound - four plus. <br><br>  But it‚Äôs worth mentioning a bit more about software: <br>  Out of the box, for example (with a month-old firmware), there were noticeable errors / clerks in English localization, a stripped-down android market (with the goal, as we, the happy owners, thought to monetize our own Chinese app store), a broken barcode scanner + This software, resetting the time zone to the Chinese +8 when restarting, along with a dozen other annoying bugs.  From that day (for the month) five firmwares have already been released, and that is nice - the above-mentioned bugs in the current firmware have already been fixed.  And the rest, I'm pretty sure, will be fixed in the very near future.  By the way, Android 2.3 will be available soon <br><br>  After almost a month of use and active participation in the thematic forums dedicated to the device, I can confidently state that this device (as well as most of the others at the start) is still in the stage of the deepest beta test.  But, which is nice - new firmware, fixing bugs and adding features, are being released by engineers who do not stop talking to users on the company's official forum weekly.  Thus, there is a very tangible hope that the device will be finished in the very near future to an adequate state, suitable for use, not only a boom capable of accepting and waiting (or helping to fix), but also an ‚Äúordinary user‚Äù.  In the meantime, unfortunately, no. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/113550/">https://habr.com/ru/post/113550/</a></p>
