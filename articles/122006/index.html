I, unfortunately, had the opportunity to participate in several unfinished projects. <br><br>  So, tips on how to fill up the project: <br><br>  1) If you need graphics in the project, each person in the team should try himself as an artist.  If the task is given to one artist, everyone must take part in the discussion of the result, give advice and help in general.  The artist at the same time need to constantly redraw and edit, in order to please everyone at once.  In general, democracy is the best method for solving all problems in a project.

      2) The concept is not needed, why waste time?  The main thing is to start writing the code as soon as possible, and ideas and concepts will definitely come along the way.  Those who start programming faster will be able to book the most interesting tasks. <br><br>  3) It is very important to change the essential things around the middle of the project, and preferably several times.  After all, it was necessary to program urgently, and chose the wrong technology, the wrong way, 3D graphics instead of 2D. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  4) Spend more time inventing and discussing the name of a project that has not yet been done or of your future firm.  How to call a ship, so he sails!  It is important to choose in advance the type of future organization, maybe a joint stock company is better than an LLC? <br><br>  5) Think in advance about how the future millions will be divided.  Threaten the most careless employees that instead of $ 600k they will receive only $ 200k. <br><br>  6) Hurry up in the project is not worth it, because still the whole life ahead.  We will finish all 1000 projects!  Someday‚Ä¶ <br><br>  7) In general, start new projects more often, and old ones carefully freeze.  In the new project there will be a new motivation, a new idea, and oh how fast it can be done.  The main thing is to learn new things, then you will switch to the old project (see point 6). <br><br>  8) After each project, conduct a long debriefing, figuring out who is the main character who failed the project?  This motivates the heroes to be more heroic in the collapse of the following projects, in which they must be taken.  After all, we already know where to step on the old rake! <br><br>  9) Helping each other in the project is not worth it, let everyone find the answer on the Internet.  So it is better remembered. <br><br>  10) Talk about your problems, too, need less, but what if someone wants to help or give advice.  In general, silence is gold!  So you can hide that for further work you need something, and thus successfully create a simple project.  It's fun when a lot of people are waiting for each other and not talking about it!  Create a deadlock for your project! <br><br>  11) The most important thing is to whine more about how well you manage to fill up the project, how successfully nothing is done, and then remind everyone more about it more often.  To entrench the spirit of heroic undoing and failing projects. <br><br>  12) It is better to do the work several times, first at random, then, someday, you can do it as it should. <br><br>  13) If you encounter someone else's code, immediately drop the work, because to understand it is very difficult and there is an excuse to do nothing.  If you really want to work on, you can rewrite everything yourself!  In general, it is better to write your functions and not to see whether there are already such in the project. <br><br>  14) More friends need to be called to the project, no matter if they are suitable for the project or not.  If someone does not want, you need to persuade for a long time, and then be offended, if not persuaded.  Each project must have its own drama! <br><br>  15) If there are new people in the project, immediately make sure that an idea or concept that is not yet invented is stolen!  Can you trust everyone? <br><br>  Maybe you have good advice, how to finish the project? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/122006/">https://habr.com/ru/post/122006/</a></p>
