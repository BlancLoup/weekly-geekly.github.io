      Deming's second principle encourages you to open your eyes to what is happening: <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  "We can no longer tolerate the work by the eye, materials that can not work, people who do not know what their job is, and are afraid to ask, damage in the process of transportation and storage, outdated methods of on-the-job training, inadequate and ineffective management, temporary managers, drivers and machinists, whose fault late trains or buses are late or even canceled.  Ignorance and vandalism increase the cost of living and, as any psychologist can say, lead to careless work and dissatisfaction with life and work. ‚Äù <br><br>  There are markets in this country where demand is so great that you, as a seller, can just send almost any of your customers to the forest. <br><br>  Cashiers at McDonald's (have you realized that I love McDonald's dearly?) Can safely stop smiling, and instead of ‚ÄúThank you!  We are waiting for you again! ‚ÄùThey can stop saying goodbye at all or start saying goodbye with the phrase‚Äú Damn you! ‚Äù: The tails will not diminish from this. <br><br>  In one provincial city, the firm for the sale and installation of air conditioners (split systems) won the tender (God) for the installation of air conditioners in all state institutions of the region.  This means that the state institution can no longer turn to any company on the market to install air conditioners.  This company won the ‚Äútender‚Äù simply because (you guessed it? Well, well, well, take the pie from the shelf) because it was owned by a deputy.  Do you know what is happening now in this company?  These imbeciles turn off the phones.  And in those rare moments when they still respond to the calls of the ‚Äúclients‚Äù, they directly and plainly say something like: ‚ÄúOh my God, how did you get it!  In the order of the queue we will install everything for you! ‚ÄùAnd hang up <br><br>  Do you think that all this is some exceptional cases? <br><br>  Try to call the support service of your mobile operator.  Or - to the support service of a hosting provider (do not know what it is? Consider yourself lucky).  Or in general - to any support service.  Go to the nearest grocery store or supermarket.  Take a walk through a regular factory for the production of something.  Then tell me. <br><br>  A couple of days ago I heard a song on Love Radio that I liked (I'm a nasty music lover).  I wanted to get this song on my iPod.  Immediately.  The problem is that I did not know the artist or the name.  I thought: all I know about this song is when it sounded: about eight o'clock in the evening.  Enter.  What to do?  I decided to call Love Radio.  When, after the twelfth dial tone, they went to the phone and I explained that I fell in love and they could save me from the poison on the basis of despair, they politely and discreetly said that they had no idea how to help me.  ‚ÄúDo you have a broadcasting schedule?‚Äù - ‚ÄúYes.‚Äù - ‚ÄúCan you tell me the name or at least the performer?‚Äù - ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù - ‚ÄúDo you record your broadcast?‚Äù - ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù - ‚ÄúHow can I find out what is this song? ‚Äù-‚Äú Listen to our radio. ‚Äù <br><br>  I hung up and - you know what I was thinking?  I thought that since the beginning of the existence of this radio, my call was probably the millionth call of a person who heard the song and wanted to know the artist and the name. <br><br>  And what did they do in this connection?  Yes, they do not care. <br><br>  Someone who does not give a damn has created websites <a href="http://www.moskva.fm/">www.moskva.fm</a> and <a href="http://www.piter.fm/">www.piter.fm</a> , where the entire broadcast of radio stations in Moscow and St. Petersburg is recorded.  Who could even suggest that?  I got this song there and other things that are pleasant to me: for example, you can register there on the site, which approximately 100% of visitors hate, using OpenID, i.e.  You are not required to give your email (you can learn the song without registration).  (Thanks Misha.) <br><br>  The number of examples of bad business philosophy is limited only by the degree of your bitterness.  For example, these examples surround me everywhere, and I can give them about two years with stops for sleeping and eating. <br><br>  We were greeted by prudent motels with such appeals nailed in piers, such as: <br>  ‚ÄúWe want you to feel at home here.  Before your arrival was made a full inventory.  Your car number is recorded.  Use hot water in moderation.  We reserve the right to evict any unwanted person without prior notice.  Do not put any unnecessary material in the toilet.  Thank you.  Come again.  Directorate. <br>  PS We consider our customers the best people in the world. ‚Äù <br>  Nabokov.  "Lolita" <br><br>  New philosophy means you need to live and work differently. <br><br>  The problem is that the meaning of your company is money?  Start by placing the product, service, and consumer in the center of your business.  And finally start doing something significant, or finally kill yourself against the wall. <br><br>  In Japan, you can order a car of the color you need and the necessary equipment on Monday and get behind the wheel on Friday.  In this country, when buying a car for your money, you will be put in a queue (I love that word) for several months: you can order your Mazda 3 in May, and perhaps you will drive in October.  And at that moment, when you, having become stupid with waiting, you will leave the salon on the brand new Mazda 3, the Japanese will drive out of the car dealership in Tokyo on the brand new Mazda 3 of the next generation. <br><br>  The business philosophy, practiced everywhere today, is weighted by losses.  All these losses are paid by the consumer. <br><br>  All the costs associated with unnecessary transportation of your raw material or finished product, input and output quality control, which means sending raw materials back to suppliers or reworking what is done poorly, so that your supply buys raw materials and rolls back, and the department sales are sold by pieces and billed for days, not for an hour, so that your people do not know what their job is, so that no one in your company knows what you are actually selling, so that your procedures are so unstable that you have  The atmosphere of a robbery constantly reigns, with the fact that your units live their own lives, with the fact that you do not have a plan and you do business, following your own inspiration only, with the fact that you decided to play dictator and saw your mission in create a subordinate atmosphere of discomfort, so that they work better, in short, any costs of your idiocy and your inability to manage - they are all paid by the consumer. <br><br>  Are you surprised that you fly into the pipe? <br><br>  Well, well, do not cry.  You can not change.  Survival is not an obligation. <br><br>  I will tell you sincerely: I am convinced that it is not competition that causes people to change and work, relying on a new philosophy.  Although it is easy to assume that it is hypersurvey and lack of competition that gives rise to companies that don't care about consumers and the quality of their goods and services.  It seems to me that in part, the very presence of such companies on the market brings a company with a new philosophy to life. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI wanted to work in a really good company so much that I had to start my own.‚Äù <br>  Joel spolsky <br><br>  No competition will force you to adopt a new philosophy.  No matter how you change under the pressure of competition, these will be palliative measures to preserve the business.  Until you accept the philosophy that puts the method in the first place, and the results in the last place.  The philosophy that formulates the method of creating a quality product and service, the method of customer satisfaction.  And the results will come by themselves. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThe result of human thinking is not so important,‚Äù the so-called ‚Äúideas‚Äù or opinions, beliefs or disbelief, in other words, conceptual knowledge, be it expressed in the form of religious dogmas, ‚Äúeternal truths‚Äù or in the form of scientific formulations and postulates, that leads to this result, namely the method of spiritual activity and thinking.  You can lose all our precious scientific results and achievements, and this will not cause significant harm as long as we possess the method, because with its help we are able to recover all lost results.  But if we lost the method, then even the largest collection of all scientific facts and results would not be able to help us. ‚Äù <br>  Lama Anagarika Govinda <br><br>  Method, i.e.  that which leads to the result is the content of the new philosophy.  It is the business method that is to be polished and brought to the highest grace, it is the business method that is to be broadcast within and outside the company, it is your business method that is your only advantage. <br><br>  Think about which platform you compete on? <br><br>  Definitely it is not a product and not a service.  Dig, Shura, dig deeper.  Forget about the economy of knowledge, network society and other canoe.  Remember: the only thing that matters is your philosophy, and in this sense I can tell you that you are competing on the basis of your attitude to life. <br><br>  The peculiarity of the new philosophy is that your attitude to life does not boil down to one, to ten or to five hundred theses.  Your attitude to life can be expressed in anything, but it will not consist in this anything. <br><br>  If you still understand what I mean, then forget that some magical tools can leave you on the other side of the crisis.  You would surely be happy if you were told what to do and gave you tools for replicating success. <br><br>  Methods you invent. <br><br>  You can at least read books about the production system of Toyota, but stupidly copying the principles of Toyota in your room, you only get a miserable copy made from another copy.  If you don‚Äôt bother thinking about what made Taichi Ono create a TPS (Toyota Production System), you still don‚Äôt understand the reality around you. <br><br>  ‚ÄúI want to make it clear to you: Toyota‚Äôs production system and Toyota‚Äôs Tao are not the same thing.  TPS is an example of a consistent and well thought-out Toyota approach. ‚Äù <br>  J. Liker <br><br>  Think about what your approach is? <br><br>  Tomorrow we will talk about dependence on quality control. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/24706/">https://habr.com/ru/post/24706/</a></p>
