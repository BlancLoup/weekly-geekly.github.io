It is noteworthy that 2 out of 8 projects have already reached their goals, 4 more than 8 out of 8 have most likely been achieved and only two projects can remain as outsiders. <br>  Below I will tell more about each of the projects. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ee0/d8f/cb9/ee0d8fcb98cdc2a9775c5918ea1b9d14.jpg" alt="image">

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h5>  LIX - The Smallest 3D Printing Pen in the World </h5><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/1vEwzDj">LIX</a> is the most compact pen for 3D printing.  With its help, you can write with plastic in the air, create a variety of art objects and just kill a lot of free time.  A sort of improved analogue of many well-known <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/201902/">3Doodler</a> <br>  It is curious that half of the team are our compatriots, although the startup positions itself from Britain. <br><br>  The project has already collected ¬£ 692,781 with ¬£ 30,000 claimed and will last another 8 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/48c/126/bcd/48c126bcd6041689e8c30a27fdd1182c.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Lunecase - Bring the back of your iPhone to life! </h5><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/1vEy98o">Lunecase</a> - a case that with the help of LEDs will display notifications from your iPhone.  It does not require recharging, as it is powered by the radiation of the phone.  This is the second project from the team from Ukraine, which previously collected $ 156,789.00 for a flash for the <a href="http://kck.st/1vEzeNn">iblazr</a> smartphone. <br><br>  The project has already raised $ 131,272 with the desired $ 50,000 and will last 15 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c02/d3b/bd5/c02d3bbd51b642dbf765084c67dac0ea.gif"><br><br><h5>  Hollywood: Make Your Own Blockbuster </h5><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/1nnSpFC">Hollywood</a> is a board game in which you can feel yourself in the director's chair, fight with friends for the biggest cashier or just make a cool movie =) <br>  I worked on this project at an early stage, and now my colleagues are engaged in it, who drafted it very well and lead directly to the intended goal! <br>  At Kickstarter, funds are collected for an international launch, while in Russia the game was already published last year. <br><br>  The project for the first day raised $ 9,018 with the desired $ 12,000 and will last 29 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e5e/504/4ae/e5e5044ae7ddbb906f93d3e806f19473.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Next generation website for CG artists </h5><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/1vEATTh">Website for CG artists</a> is an attempt to revive cghub.com resource for which concept artist Kirill Chepizhko is raising funds.  Charges are not very active and at the moment it seems that the project will not collect the planned amount. <br><br>  The project raised $ 29,185 with the desired $ 90,000 and will last another 18 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2f7/366/608/2f7366608f65cf9f1fe81b3622806314.png"><br><br><h5>  CHECHIL BITES: GRAB N 'GO CHEESE SNACK </h5><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/1qyoe4j">CHECHIL BITES</a> - yes, this is just a snack in the form of pieces of smoked cheese.  This is another domestic project and its authors have already <a href="http://kck.st/1vEBX9B">collected $ 27,205</a> on smoked cheese braids.  By the way, be sure to see the end of the video.  I laughed for a long time =) <br>  The dynamics of the fees is two times worse than the previous project, but I hope that the guys will be able to squeeze the Western press and exceed the desired amount! .. <br><br>  The project raised $ 8.805 with the desired $ 20,000 and will last another 20 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/6ca/9ed/2b3/6ca9ed2b39c1308496ffb85c69030966.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Ships of years past - stop-motion film </h5><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/1vECgkR">Ships of years past</a> is an animated puppet film about the sea captain and his last journey.  Very soulful project, which should reach the set level. <br><br>  The project raised $ 9,388 from $ 10,000 and will last another 5 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b46/1d5/44a/b461d544ab9e01f4d39de02344c0b550.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Verge - handcrafted wallet with spirit </h5><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/1vEDsVl">Verge</a> is handmade accessories made from genuine leather.  You can purchase a bracelet, wallet and key fastener.  It is curious that the <a href="http://kck.st/1vEEkct">first similar project of the</a> author ended in defeat, but he made the goods cheaper, the goal is lower and it seems that now he is going to success!  And yes, the name of the project reminds me of something ... <br><br>  The project gathered $ 2,296 from $ 3,000 per day and will last 29 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5e6/cfd/904/5e6cfd90410412eff01c7f9f62abbb7b.jpg"><br><br><h5>  Joy's ABC and Spelling - iOS Book </h5><br>  <a href="http://kck.st/1gGEkPz">Joy's ABC</a> is an English primer from Minsk, which in a playful and friendly manner will teach children English. <br>  It is a pity that the cute illustrations have not yet attracted the attention of the press and backers, but I hope that everything is still ahead!  If the work with the press has not been and is not being carried out, then the result, unfortunately, is quite natural. <br><br>  The project has raised just $ 58.00 out of the desired $ 5,000 and will last 23 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b5e/cb5/0eb/b5ecb50ebc8bec226b9e1775de527548.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Indiegogo </h4><br><br><h5>  ReactOS Community Edition </h5><br>  <a href="http://bit.ly/1vFftFD">ReactOS</a> is a free open-source operating system that is compatible with the programs and drivers of modern releases of Microsoft Windows.  Let me remind you that earlier the team has already tried its strength <a href="http://kck.st/1vFillG">on Kickstarter</a> and collected $ 48,965 from the desired $ 120,000. <br><br>  The project raised $ 20,548 out of the desired $ 50,000 and will last another 12 days. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a5b/8d2/87f/a5b8d287fed93e2710aa846e07f66b86.png"><br><br><h5>  Conclusion </h5><br><br>  We wish our teams good luck and do not forget that in our hands the development of domestic crowdfunding, both in the role of backers, and in the role of authors of the projects! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/223615/">https://habr.com/ru/post/223615/</a></p>
