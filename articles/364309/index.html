  <section class="page js-page"><h1>The eternal question: is there any money in the field of 3D printing, or how to earn it</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Today we will talk about how you can make money on the 3D printing market.  I want to share my experience, warn against some mistakes, and find people who are just as interested in all this as I am. <br><br>  For a start, a little story, like an ordinary architect working for an interior decoration company, caught fire and lost his sleep after learning about 3D printers.  But the usual junior architect could not afford to pay a bloated staff, and huge injections of money into advertisements, companies that resell Chinese 3D printers, or simply collect slightly modified or supplemented printers in the territory of our huge homeland. <br><br>  So, having figured what it was, I started searching for information about printers, and several times, I ran into articles about how other people themselves collected similar printers, and some of them were even very personal.  And there were drawn up, some similarity estimates, and I was very happy with the price tag, and I especially liked that I could do something with my own hands, and it would work.  Anyway, it all sounded like a challenge.

      After a few months, searches, inquiries, and studies, I had on my desk just such a bunch of parts that turned into a 3D printer in the future. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/df1/72c/898/df172c8987f344f9b755ee3caa1bbdb4.jpg"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  I would like to express special thanks to all those people who patiently answered my very stupid questions and helped me with the choice of my first parts suppliers.  Since  well, I‚Äôm very annoying, especially when I want something, and I achieve it by any means. <br><br>  And now, after about a week, terrible questions about how all this should turn into a 3D printer, shoveling dozens of instructions, reading all sorts of nonsense in different forums, and many sleepless nights, with my own hands, I created such a miracle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/98e/21e/313/98e21e313b47418f9cc69a31df36b3f8.jpg"><br><br>  Unfortunately, I can not convey the emotions that I experienced when he began to work.  It is impossible even to compare with anything, it was genuine childish happiness, I was jumping around the house like crazy, and I was in an euphoria comparable to the feeling when I first met my wife. <br><br>  That was my first Circuit, printed on my first device (in general, the first, before that, probably collected only Lego in childhood) <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/bd5/d08/48d/bd5d0848d3204e8d9ac1c0b6ca95abe6.jpg"><br><br>  So, after that it started, I realized that the 3D printer can and should bring money, I began to find out and get acquainted personally with the big players in the market, and make ‚Äúuseful‚Äù acquaintances.  I got acquainted with the director of the company, which produces plastic, took the word that they produce good plastic (in fact, it turned out).  Started selling plastic for the printer.  As it turned out later, you won‚Äôt earn much on this, and I decided to print kits for printer assembly and sell them.  Here I was waiting for more success, because  The sets were a great success, and at the same time it was possible to give the plastic, anyway, the person will need it.  But that's bad luck, typing sets is a long, dreary, and even greater risks.  Since  It takes about 4 days to print one set of continuous operation of the printer.  These four days, you naturally will not spend next to the printer, so you had to follow all this from work, from your phone, as you wish, most importantly, do not leave unattended.  Since  At the moment, almost all printers are not protected against spontaneous combustion (Yes, this is true, but manufacturers do not speak much about it) There are many reasons for which it can burn, starting from the loss of the thermistor, ending with the failure of forced cooling.  (Ps the heating element will not fail due to overheating, I checked that it can be heated to white and nothing will happen to it.) Here is a photo of the burned-out printer: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/a79/e66/d94/a79e66d94bb64e6ba920acd8c42edc93.jpg"><br><br>  Therefore, I realized that a big return would be from what I can provide people with my experience in assembling a normal 3D printer, at adequate prices.  And it turned out to be much more profitable.  So besides this, there is a demand for it.  Let it take much more time, and large investments.  And of course, responsibility for the created product increases.  But there are also huge advantages, this understanding of how the market is organized, what price is built from, vast experience, the need for continuous development and improvement of skills. <br><br>  And I urge people who know how to assemble printers, unite and do.  Only in this way will it be possible to drop prices for printers at the moment, or to raise the quality of their assembly, since  more than once it was said, now they are very overpriced. <br><br>  Let's cooperate. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/364309/">https://habr.com/ru/post/364309/</a></p>
