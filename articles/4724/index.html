There is no exception and spiritual food, to which an increasing number of Runet students begins to include regular reading blogs.  And our beloved Yandex, it seems, also overdid it, day after day, feeding the readers in his ‚ÄúBlog rating‚Äù with the same ‚Äúsoup‚Äù from dolboeb or ‚Äúblack caviar‚Äù from sholademi.  I have great respect and interest in the work of the authors from the first page of the rating, but their nicknames will probably already remember by heart even those who have never been on the Internet, therefore, to continue stubbornly showing the same information to the same people every day for many months in a row in the era of Web 2.0 somehow not entirely humane.

      Moreover, many world resources have long been faced with this problem and have found quite effective ways to solve it.  One of the simplest and most successful is the addition of the ability to rank participants not only by rating, but also by the derivative of it - the growth rate, which, additionally, will make it possible to diversify the service with the choice of measurement time - 24 hours a week, a month.  This would give users the opportunity to receive more new information, ordered by their desire, and the service to increase the depth and time of viewing the resource, thereby increasing loyalty and solving advertising or other issues. <br><br>  And in the ranking of Yandex blogs there are already two important derivatives - a change in location and a change in authority!  The first would allow to give a chance to completely newcomers, by writing very interesting material and rising from some 1,000,000 places to 100,000 - 200,000, get to the top of the rating for a short time and even be bought for a moment in glory!  This is, of course, a lottery, but how much more exciting and interesting it is! <br><br>  The second, more important, would give the opportunity to prove himself to be active and well-working middle-level authors who created the most interesting content for the measured period and earned the greatest increase in credibility, declare themselves and find new readers. <br><br>  Finally, no one calls for the existing version of the rating to be canceled, it just should not be the only possible one. <br><br>  Such changes would not only increase the usefulness and interestingness of the rating, but also improve the blogosphere itself, increase the incentive to create new, original content, reduce mindless copy-paste, meaningless squabbles and disputes and bring it to a new level of development. <br><br>  Especially since all the data for this are available, you only need to enable users to sort the table by other fields of the database.  For such a talented programmer as kukutz, and even an avid Habrahabrovtsa, work for a couple of hours!  Yes, and his leader, dear Segalovich Ilya Valentinovich, a frequent guest at Habr√©. <br><br>  Let us together ask them to do it for the common good and prosperity of the blogosphere.  And at the same time we will show that the time of Web 2.0 and real social media is coming in Runet! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/4724/">https://habr.com/ru/post/4724/</a></p>
