  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Review of the first tablet Nokia Lumia 2520</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Rumors about the "big" device from Nokia went for six months.  Heated by numerous rumors and teasers, the public wondered what kind of device it would be (there were even options for a tablet on a Windows Phone or laptop).  All covers were dropped last October at <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Nokia/blog/198558">the Nokia World conference</a> in Abu Dhabi, where we presented the first tablet <br>  on Windows RT 8.1. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/884/755/768/884755768832e40f2ee847a7e7deac57.jpg"><br><br>  Not so long ago, the Nokia Lumia 2520 got to Russia, and in this regard, we decided to arrange a detailed review of this device. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Looking ahead, it is worth noting that the Nokia Lumia 2520 - does not immediately reveal itself.  This is not a typical mobile device for consuming content, as one might have thought at first.  Rather, it is a tablet with ample opportunities for its (content) creation.  At the same time, we cannot say that Nokia Lumia 2520 was released with the expectation of replacing modern laptops.  However, the ability to solve many working and creative tasks suggests that this tablet is more than just a gaming and entertainment platform - a kind of all-in-one device.  But first things first.

    <h4>  Housing </h4><br>  The design of the tablet Nokia Lumia 2520 is the embodiment of the stylistic decisions of the latest models of the Nokia Lumia line in the tablet device form factor. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/325/b35/a4a/325b35a4afbcf9459713b247ddc31e3f.jpg"><br><br>  The case material is traditional for our flagship devices polycarbonate.  The tablet is available in black, blue, white and red, but in Russia the Nokia Lumia 2520 is only available in red and black.  It is noteworthy that the Lumia 2520 differ not only in color, but also in the type of coating: the black model has a matte finish, and the red one is glossy. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c48/365/f95/c48365f95ad3f9dbe736921e2d7fef42.png"><br><br>  However, even in red, the tablet does not look like a frivolous gadget.  This is rather a catchy "high-tech", distinguishing it from the mass of competitive devices. <br><br>  Almost the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe front panel occupies a 10.1-inch screen with Gorilla Glass 2 from Corning.  Through it is visible front camera and information LED.  In addition, the only visible elements on the front panel are the touch "Windows button" and speaker sockets. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c09/277/c04/c09277c0496313eb1af0075f7d28e857.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0bd/fa6/155/0bdfa6155d8dd3a122602932475a196a.jpg"><br><br>  Despite the large screen size, in the hands of the tablet does not seem cumbersome at all and leaves the impression of a gadget suitable for use on the go.  This is confirmed by the actual dimensions of the device: 267 x 168 mm with a thickness of only 8.9 mm.  The weight of the tablet is 615 grams. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0b/06c/3de/e0b06c3de67f99cf3f96b163b0831888.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/20d/011/bdf/20d011bdfb223d78a32ccbcd01abcf24.jpg"><br><br>  On the monolithic back surface, only the eye of the main camera and the Nokia logo stand out.  All other controls and data transfer to end.  There are located: a button on / unlock, a slot for a memory card and a SIM card and an interface for connecting additional accessories. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/8dc/766/b6f/8dc766b6ff00bac79903a0a911a04264.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/923/29d/0c3/92329d0c383fd68288eda8fc902f183c.jpg"><br><br>  You can also see microUSB 3.0 and microHDMI connectors, a standard 3.5 mm jack for connecting headphones and a connector for connecting a charger.  The latter, due to its shape, recalls the classic Nokia chargers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/198/d43/b2a/198d43b2a2163539f94c0df0a73c7296.jpg"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/629/de3/f80/629de3f8085e86d9cd6a9d97fbfab0ed.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Hardware capabilities </h4><br>  As we mentioned above, the screen diagonal is 10.1 inches with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels and a density of 218 ppi.  Like most Nokia smartphones, the Lumia 2520 LCD screen is based on IPS technology.  From the "younger brothers" the novelty received <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Nokia/blog/205264">ClearBlack technology</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/be6/6f9/c3e/be66f9c3eba9599440d1a0629fefb82c.jpg"><br><br>  Due to the presence of additional layers, the ClearBlack screen allows you to minimize glare and keep the image saturated and readable.  In practice, the Lumia 2520 in various lighting conditions (reading news feeds and social networks in public transport, using it as a navigator in the car, casual games at home and partially writing this post in the office) can be said that the screen readability always remained at a comfortable level. <br><br>  On the quality indicators of the screen also work high brightness and wide corners of the matrix.  The claimed brightness value is 650 nits (cd / m¬≤), but in practice, the indicators can reach even higher values ‚Äã‚Äã(for example, in the Hi-Tech@Mail.ru test, the indicators were 731 nits (cd / m¬≤)).  Even with a directional light source on the tablet, you can work, for example, by holding it at an angle. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f15/1aa/6cc/f151aa6cc3734fa095176966d3a0e4c4.jpg"><br><br>  The next important point in the description of the Nokia Lumia 2520 filling is its ‚Äúheart and brain‚Äù - a Qualcomm Snapdragon 800 processor.  Nokia has become one of the first manufacturers who used this system-on-chip (SoC) for tablet computers in principle and in the field for devices on Windows 8.1 RT in particular. <br><br>  The system itself is made using 28-nanometer technology.  It includes: four Krait 400 computing cores operating at 2.2 GHz, Adreno 330, Hexagon v5 DSP graphics processor with 4G LTE support, USB 3.0 and Bluetooth, as well as the ability to display images on screens with a resolution of 2560 x 2048 pixels <br><br>  Nokia Lumia 2520 by default is equipped with 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of internal memory for the system, applications and user content.  The microSD memory card slot will allow to increase the user's ‚Äúpersonal‚Äù space by another 64 GB. <br><br>  We'll talk about applications a little later, but in the context of performance it is worth noting that this configuration provides smooth multitasking.  Especially considering the fact that applications retain all the functionality when switching between them. <br><br>  Windows RT 8.1 in the Nokia Lumia 2520 also allows you to work in multi-window mode when applications share a single screen.  This is very convenient, for example, if your news feed has moved into the social networking space.  Now you don‚Äôt have to constantly switch between the browser and the Twitter event feed (VKontakte, Facebook), but open the links in a parallel window.  Moreover, the size of these windows can be adjusted to your liking. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/62b/fdb/636/62bfdb6366a40b30c464fd66d36f123f.jpg"><br><br>  By the way, to work with Internet content, the device provides not only Wi-Fi, but also the 4G module mentioned above.  This solution, we note, is not so common among tablets on Windows.  If we talk about local data exchange between devices, then on this account in the "big" Lumia provides support for modern standards Bluetooth 4.0, microUSB 3.0 and even NFC. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7ea/569/0ac/7ea5690ace2f4c2eb3548cc8d2e15d8a.jpg"><br><br>  The tablet is equipped with two built-in cameras: the main camera with Zeiss optics (!) Has a resolution of 6.7 megapixels, and the front one - 2 megapixels, while both cameras support recording in Full HD. <br><br>  Through the use of the latest generation of components (in particular, the Snapdragon 800 system-on-chip, solid-state drive, etc.) and the features of Windows RT 8.1, the device is highly energy efficient.  This, combined with the presence of a powerful battery with a capacity of 8120 mAh, provides up to 25 days of operation in standby mode and 11 hours of continuous video viewing. <br><br>  Nokia Lumia 2520 is charged from a special charger and supports fast charging, allowing you to recharge a charge by 80% in just one hour. <br><br>  In the conclusion of the review of the hardware capabilities of Nokia Lumia 2520, we propose to look at the results of benchmarks PC Benchmark, 3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited, Disk Bencmark, GFXBench and nCore CPU Mark: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/005/c24/679/005c246799fab24460f8b93f75a63ac6.png"><br>  <i>PC Benchmark</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e0a/9da/385/e0a9da385f2dce68a42a95803ed31f4f.png"><br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/7b9/8aa/571/7b98aa571cc14987040c00f37fa2608c.png"><br>  <i>3DMark Ice Storm Unlimited</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5d3/8f4/4fb/5d38f44fbfe757bf34c48d155dc487ce.png"><br>  <i>Disk bencmark</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/029/ead/20e/029ead20e47e6a08894b2ae6761bca6e.jpg"><br>  <i>GFXBench</i> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f6b/dd8/b1c/f6bdd8b1cc8a7fc861daea60e6fc3d65.png"><br>  <i>nCore CPU Mark</i> <br><br><h4>  Windows RT 8.1 </h4><br>  There are many differences between Windows 8.1 and Windows RT 8.1.  If the first is designed for x86 / x64 architecture, then RT is exclusively for mobile ARM.  This means that ‚Äúclassic‚Äù applications will not be able to run on the Nokia Lumia 2520. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9c/973/309/b9c9733093e328c34de7de258d15a9fd.jpg"><br><br>  However, if you look from the point of view of an ordinary tablet buyer and compare it to mobile OS, then Windows RT has several advantages. <br><br>  Unlike other systems, file management in Windows RT is not implemented in the form of any complex third-party application, but is a ‚Äúconductor‚Äù familiar to the eye. <br><br>  The initial screen with tiles is sharpened by gestures and combines the information content of widgets and the simplicity of application icons. <br>  If Windows 8.1 is installed on your main computer, the system automatically synchronizes its settings and applications (including their location on the home screen) with your Lumia 2520. To do this, just log in with your account. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/fdf/019/f6e/fdf019f6e10d82f171431926053a4e1f.jpg"><br><br>  But back to the point where we started talking about Windows RT 8.1. <br><br><h4>  Applications </h4><br>  Traditional arguments opponents of Windows RT - the lack of "classic" applications and a modest range of "Shop".  However, classic Windows applications are not optimized for touch control, and the official application store is no longer small - 200,000 applications as of the end of 2013.  Many major publishers and services have already released or are going to release their applications for the platform. <br><br>  Many "gaming" giants, like Gameloft (Asphalt 8), Disney, Microsoft Studios began to confidently master the WinRT platform.  The hardware capabilities of the Nokia Lumia 2520 are sufficient to cope with any of the modern tablet hits. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e26/422/125/e26422125fdb5ccd9c783be056240396.jpg"><br><br>  In the Lumia 2520, all of the above complements (familiar to Lumia smartphone owners) with an exclusive from Nokia.  Currently, branded applications include: Nokia Camera, HERE Maps, Nokia Mix Radio, Nokia Stories, and a few more. <br><br>  ‚ÄúNokia Camera‚Äù, so loved by Lumia users, is an application for shooting with a user-friendly interface, fine-tuning of shooting parameters and high-quality frame processing.  All of the above, of course, was optimized for the tablet. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e34/2e7/35d/e342e735d70d51a7e4d2c823a6a6fe3b.jpg"><br><br>  This application allows you to make a choice: to provide the definition of parameters to the Nokia Camera algorithms or to adjust the white balance, focal length, ISO values, shutter speed and exposure at your discretion. <br><br>  "HERE Maps" - detailed maps that have proven themselves not only on Nokia smartphones, but also on a <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Nokia/blog/209998">number of navigation systems of</a> various automakers.  The application has offline navigation mode.  To do this, it is enough to load the cards into the device‚Äôs memory in advance.  In online mode, dynamic real-time traffic data is available to the user.  But HERE will be convenient to use not only for motorists, but also for pedestrians and people traveling by public transport, since HERE can also build such types of routes. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/f94/5a5/ff9/f945a5ff9d279a37a8a9c45e03543869.jpg"><br><br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/Nokia/blog/200572">Nokia Stories</a> is a different look at the photo gallery on your smartphone or tablet.  Using HERE geolocation information, this application places icons of photos and videos on the world map to create a kind of ‚Äújourney in pictures‚Äù. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/46f/463/33b/46f46333b03128ea20bac80ebd358ee2.png"><br><br>  Nokia Mix-Radio is a streaming audio service.  It offers the user the opportunity to listen to music not only by performers and compositions, but also in special editorial as well as custom selections.  The service can also work offline. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/13f/2c7/58f/13f2c758fee8bd9160f8e1feca690c1b.jpg"><br><br>  Also in the arsenal of the tablet from Nokia there is a simple tool for video editing Nokia Video Director, informational interactive ‚Äúguide‚Äù on the My Nokia tablet and the application ‚ÄúNotifications from the operator‚Äù, which allows you to receive service messages from the telecom operator. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/834/4b1/0ae/8344b10ae4b56ed8da885e1d5d30ca6b.jpg"><br><br><h4>  Nokia Lumia 2520 as a tool for work </h4><br>  We specifically brought this section beyond the scope of the applications, since we decided to take a look at the Nokia Lumia 2520 from a different point of view, namely as a replacement for a working laptop. <br><br>  First of all, I would like to note that all owners of this tablet by default receive a basic Microsoft Office application package, which includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote.  Applications are no different from their x86 counterparts and the main tasks, such as creating tables or demonstrating presentations (recall the microHDMI connector), will be easy for Lumia 2520 users. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/aac/27e/01a/aac27e01a9a2eeafcfc061f17bf4c10e.jpg"><br><br>  In addition to this, users can download corporate applications from the Store: <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/ba4b9485-8712-41ff-a9ea-6243a3e07682">Lync</a> for communication with colleagues, conferences, video calls, <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/86a8f7a0-5bd4-4d30-b65e-456d0f58b594">SharePoint Newsfeed</a> for receiving news and participating in discussions from SharePoint sites, as well as <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/b7e7c94d-2ea3-4fa6-a277-9d19a1f697ba">Microsoft Power BI</a> for constant access to Microsoft reports Office 365. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/1d3/a18/287/1d3a182877a89cbb1b5c3d9162b63ca2.jpg"><br>  <i>Microsoft Power BI</i> <br><br>  Another important point to use the Nokia Lumia 2520 in organizations is the ability of the Nokia Lumia 2520 to work in a corporate network using a VPN connection.  Network settings are set through the general settings of the tablet. <br><br>  For those whose work is somehow connected with Microsoft Dynamics, <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/93772212-7b72-4aee-bc4e-b1adb7712ebe">Microsoft Dynamics CRM</a> , <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/50dc0fad-729f-41ce-8e26-c48e3007f067">Dynamics AX 2012 Approvals</a> , <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/07aab6f9-c6ce-4b81-b04c-4b43c3f6de67">Dynamics AX 2012 Expenses,</a> and <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/2ac31b2e-f3fa-4f1c-bfb9-151393749246">Dynamics AX 2012 Timesheets</a> will come to the rescue. <br><br>  Microsoft Dynamics CRM is a ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù for tracking and managing your organization's CRM database.  The last three applications let you manage approvals, reports, and time sheets in Dynamics AX 2012. All applications are available for free in the Windows Application Store. <br><br>  Also there you can find the <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/19d94f81-db21-4234-8b49-806694dbbaea">My Server 2012</a> and <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/windows/ru-ru/app/67e86695-bda3-4f32-96c4-2e20e56f1cf3">My Server 2012 R2</a> app to work with Windows Server 2012 Essentials and Windows Server 2012 R2 Essentials, respectively.  Through the interface of these applications, you can manage users, devices, alerts, and access shared files.  In addition, the files that were recently accessed using the My Server application will even be available offline, which is convenient if you work with them on trips or, for example, in the subway. <br><br>  To create simple applications, for example, for personal or corporate use, you can resort to using the Microsoft Project Siena application.  To create a product catalog or an interactive FAQ, you do not need any special skills in writing code.  Read more about how to work with this application can be read <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/microsoft/blog/206762">here</a> . <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/de1/6f4/d27/de16f4d270d55a9f2b18aa80c88cc7f8.jpg"><br><br>  What else?
