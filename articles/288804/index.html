  <section class="page js-page"><h1>China will have its own Wikileaks</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Looking at the experience of Western comrades, in the face of the Wikileaks service, the Chinese dissidents decided to create a resource of a similar orientation.  It seems that the idea of ‚Äã‚ÄãWikileaks is finding a greater response in society, and, perhaps, in the future, similar resources will appear in each country.  Although, not all governments are worried about the data that can be placed on such resources - some simply ‚Äúlet things down‚Äù, even if the published information is very relevant.  But the governments of the United States and China are clearly not one of those, and for this reason, the published information makes them ‚Äúmove‚Äù, acknowledging some mistakes, which then have to be corrected. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a>  The Chinese dissidents announced their intention to launch their own Wikileaks in an October 22 interview with the South China Morning Post.  The Chinese emphasize their independence from Wikileaks, stating that only an idea unites them with this resource.  Recall that Wikileaks publishes in public access the secret documents of the US government about the war in the United States, Iraq and some other materials.  At the moment, there are hundreds of thousands of documents, audio and video recordings on the servers of Wikileaks, about which only lazy people are not talking now. <br><br>  In the wake of the popularity of Wikileaks rose after the publication of the video with the US military, who shot the unsuspecting journalists from Iraq, standing in a group around the minibus.  The Americans decided that the locals and the minibus were incompatible things, and they shot both the people and the vehicle.  As they say, "away from sin."  If it were not for Wikileaks, then this case would have remained unnoticed by anyone and everything would get away with it.  And so, the United States military still has to get out, explaining this incident, and lean on ensuring the safety of the civilian population of Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries where there is a military contingent of America.

      As for the Chinese, here the dissidents are fighting for the introduction of democratic principles in China, plus the developers are going to return the rights to information to people.  The project involves journalists, hackers, lawyers, proofreaders and people of other professions who can ensure the normal operation of the site. <br><br>  Interestingly, many IT experts from China consider this venture to be unsuccessful - in their opinion, it is impossible to open this resource in China and remain at large, unnoticed by anyone.  This Essendzh, head of Wikileaks, can travel from country to country without worrying (for now) about the possible imprisonment.  But in China, everything is a little different - the slightest suspicion of a "conspiracy", and a person can almost go to jail for life. <br><br>  In any case, creating resources like Wikileaks is a rather interesting idea that can really affect officials, both of the highest and of the lowest ranks. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/288804/">https://habr.com/ru/post/288804/</a></p>
