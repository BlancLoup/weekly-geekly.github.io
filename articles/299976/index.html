  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Trade "window to Europe": the Ministry of Economic Development has prepared a project to create "Russian Alibaba"</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The Ministry of Economic Development has developed a project "Electronic commerce as a driver for the development of activities of small and medium-sized businesses in the domestic and foreign markets."  The project involves the creation of a platform that combines "promotional, customs, logistics, information, payment, credit, insurance and other services necessary for the sale of goods through e-commerce for export and within the country." <br><br>  As conceived by the authors of the project, the platform should become ‚Äúone window‚Äù (aggregator) for Russian producers to enter world markets.  In addition, it should be integrated with the largest foreign electronic platforms, such as <a href="http://ru.aliexpress.com/ru_home.htm">AliExpress</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon.com">Amazon</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBay">eBay</a> , <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD.com">JD.com</a> and others, ‚Äúin order to promote Russian goods to international markets‚Äù. <br><br>  For the formation of a pool of exporters, the Russian Export Center ( <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D1%2581%25D0%25BF%25D0%25BE%25D1%2580%25D1%2582%25D0%25BD%25D1%258B%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2586%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D1%2580">REC</a> ) should be responsible, it will also assist in standardization and certification of products, and then ‚Äúsend‚Äù exporters to the aggregator.

      At the site of the aggregator, exporters will have their own personal account with functionality for accepting and executing orders, payment and logistics of goods, and claims. <a name="habracut"></a><br><blockquote>  Money from the sale of goods will go to the account of the aggregator in the bank for the passage of currency control procedures and the payment of relevant taxes and fees.  In addition, the site will be able to perform the function of a tax agent. </blockquote>  Such an approach can ensure uninterrupted receipt of proceeds by exporters, as well as the replenishment of all levels of the budgets of the Russian Federation, increasing the efficiency of administration, Kommersant <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2957980">reports</a> , citing a document. <br><br>  The ‚ÄúPersonal Account‚Äù will allow the exporter to receive credit, insurance and warranty support from <a href="https://www.exiar.ru/">EXIAR</a> , <a href="http://eximbank.ru/">Roseximbank</a> (which will come under the control of the REC) or other organizations that will be connected to the aggregator.  In addition, the platform will ‚Äúaccumulate the insurance premium‚Äù of exporters - it may be necessary to resolve disputes with foreign buyers. <br><br>  Disputes will be resolved without the direct participation of exporters - <a href="http://www.taker.im/article/2820-spor-na-Aliexpress-otkryitie-i-vedenie">such as</a> AliExpress. <br><br>  ‚ÄúThere is no single exporter environment, it needs to be developed, this will certainly require serious investments from the project participants, assistance will also be needed to connect all companies that have export potential.  With a certain administrative resource, this can be solved, ‚Äùsays <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%2592%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2582">Wikimart</a> CEO Andrei Klenin.  According to him, the platform should involve any companies - logistics, insurance, banking. <br><br>  Creating an aggregator from scratch will take at least a year, but at the same time, similar tools have already been created in Russia - for example, there is an existing marketplace for the Association of Internet Trading Companies, says director of <a href="https://www.hkgbusiness.com/en/company/Abk-China-Services-Limited">ABK China Services</a> Ivan Sinitsyn.  The consolidation of all service functions on a single platform may lead to reduced competition between service companies.  This could ultimately affect the exporters of small and medium-sized businesses, he <a href="http://kommersant.ru/doc/2957980">warns</a> . <br><blockquote>  According to the Ministry of Economy, there are 5.6 million small and medium-sized businesses in Russia, about 16 thousand of them are exporters, which is only 0.28%.  The volume of Russian exports is $ 497.8 billion.  The volume of the online retail market in Russia in 2015 amounted to 650 billion rubles (an increase of 16% in rubles and a decrease of 28% in dollars), its cross-border segment - 160 billion rubles (an increase of 88% in rubles and 28% in dollars ), rated Data Insight. </blockquote><br>  ‚ÄúMegamind‚Äù <a href="https://megamozg.ru/post/23584/">wrote</a> that in December 2015, the general director of the Tuva Energy Industrial Corporation Ruslan Baisarov sent the president a letter proposing ‚Äúto create an internal e-commerce infrastructure,‚Äù which should allow ‚Äúany manufacturer of high-quality products‚Äù from Russia ‚Äúto enter global markets‚Äù, ‚Äúfind your client "and" compete anywhere in the world. " <br><br>  ‚ÄúI am sure that Russian exporters need two things: simplifying the VAT refund and a faster and more transparent procedure for processing customs documents.  As for who exactly could play the role of such a platform - I believe that it can be any Russian company or structure: ‚ÄúRussian Post‚Äù, EXIAR export agency, a company created by Ruslan Baisarov, or any large Russian retailer is not fundamentally ", summarizes Alexey Fedorov.  On December 10, the president endorsed a letter with the wording ‚Äúreview and support‚Äù <br><br>  The founder of the largest Chinese online retailer Alibaba, Jack Ma, also supported the initiative of Vladimir Putin to create an Internet platform for the export of Russian industrial goods. <br><br>  Ma hopes that <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alibaba_Group">Alibaba</a> will be able to help develop Russian e-commerce infrastructure, as well as take part in creating an e-commerce platform in Russia. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/299976/">https://habr.com/ru/post/299976/</a></p>
