  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Dope for the brain want to put into mass production</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The pharmacological industry produces more and more drugs that are designed to improve brain activity.  Many tablets are sold without a prescription at any pharmacy, while others are easy to buy on the black market or get a prescription fraudulently.  These drugs improve concentration, increase the speed of thinking, resistance to stress and emotional stability. <br><br>  Despite all the side effects, such drugs are now used by people of various professions: scientists, musicians, top managers, students and even professional poker players.  Managers improve performance and cognitive abilities in corporate intrigues.  Students easily remember everything they read before the exam, and poker players have an important advantage over their rivals.  For example, professional player Paul Phillips (earned more than $ 2.3 million in his career) takes Adderall (improves concentration) and provigil (a potent analog of caffeine) during important tournaments, <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-braindoping20dec20,0,6487141.story">writes the LA Times</a> . <br><br>  The list of drugs to increase the efficiency of the brain also includes Ritalin (a stimulator of the central nervous system), Aricept, Inderal and other substances that block the beta-adrenoreceptors responsible for the perception of adrenaline by the brain.  After that, the person completely disappears excitement. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All of the above medicines were not created at all for professionals to take them in the form of legal doping.  Initially, each of them is intended for the treatment of a particular disease.  For example, Aricept was created to help Alzheimer's sufferers, and Ritalin is prescribed for children who have attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.  This is a very common disorder in modern children.  The drug is widely used in the United States, in some schools up to 20% of students take it, and because of the hallucinations and great pleasure from taking Ritalin, it is also called <a href="http://www.notodrugs.ru/facts/ritalin.php">"baby cocaine</a> . <a href="http://www.notodrugs.ru/facts/ritalin.php">"</a>

      All modern drugs are one thing in common: they appeared quite recently, so the effect of long-term medication has not been fully studied.  However, poker players and top managers are not interested in long-term consequences.  The short-term, instant effect is important for them - and they receive it. <br><br>  Experts from the pharmaceutical industry say that such drugs will clearly be in demand in the market.  This is indicated at least by the huge popularity in modern society of caffeine (it is an alkaloid with narcotic properties, with a similar, but only weak, effect on the brain, slightly improving concentration and memory).  Despite the weak effect and unpleasant side effects, many people are willing to take this substance in large quantities throughout the day. <br><br>  Therefore, now in the pharmacological laboratories there is intense work on the next generation brain stimulants, which will be specifically designed for this purpose and will be hundreds of times more effective than caffeine.  According to experts, the very first tool that really improves a person‚Äôs memory will become even more popular with Viagra.  As is known, Viagra is one of the most significant discoveries in medicine in recent decades, which brought its creators the 1998 Nobel Prize in the field of medicine, as well as the multi-billion profits of the Pfizer Corporation. <br><br>  In accordance with the <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blog/arbeit/32604.html">concept of Bill Gates</a> , all modern people without exception may be potential consumers of brain doping.  Bill Gates says that almost every job today people work with information, ranging from a worker at a supermarket warehouse that reads barcodes on products with a hand-held scanner and ends with an executive director who analyzes the most important market trends in a business analysis program.  The main qualities that are necessary for success in the modern world are not honesty, not sincerity and friendliness, but good memory, concentration of attention and, in general, effective brain activity. <br><br>  Who knows, perhaps in the future, drugs that improve brain activity will become mandatory for all office workers to receive at the beginning of the working day and at lunchtime, as now caffeine is encouraged by employers.  It may not even be necessary to force anyone, because many people like it when their brain works better, so they will take the drugs voluntarily. <br><br>  via <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-braindoping20dec20,0,6487141.story">LA Times</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/18061/">https://habr.com/ru/post/18061/</a></p>
