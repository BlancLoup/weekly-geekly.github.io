Student stories from our educational projects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  Before September 1, I decided to tell about our educational projects - <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/250219/">Technopark</a> and <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/mailru/blog/253441/">Technosphere</a> - from a new point of view.  The product is simpler and probably the most correct to judge by user feedback.  For this article, I collected the opinions of our graduates - the ‚Äúusers‚Äù of the Technosphere and Technopark - and offer them to you ‚Äúas is‚Äù.  These are answers to 10 questions about our projects, which, it seems to me, will better describe them than I do. <br><br>  Below are stories about how a student came to the university to eat dumplings, and stayed to study at the Technopark;  about what makes you get up early on a Saturday morning when there are no university classes;  about how a career begins in Technopark and Tekhnosfere and how to find your team in a ‚Äúgreat IT porridge‚Äù. <br><br><div style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/262/a2f/164/262a2f164feb42789fec93112ba8abb8.png"></div><br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  1. Why did you decide to enter the project? </h1><br>  <b>Konstantin S</b> .: ‚ÄúI entered the Technopark because the main specialty was rather narrow, and I wanted to have a backup plan for a career.  A place where I would not have to start from scratch.  After a month and a half of study, I realized that I had received more than I wanted.  But then I still did not understand how ".

      <b>Michael K</b> .: ‚ÄúI was looking through the news feed on VKontakte and saw that one of my friends joined the Technosphere group.  I read that there will soon be a selection for an educational project in the form of offline testing.  I have always been attracted to events where you can compete and show your knowledge, so I went to the selection.  I was not going to act initially.  Since I successfully passed the test, I decided not to miss the opportunity. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Dinar S.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ziontab/" class="user_link">ziontab</a> : ‚ÄúI learned about the creation of the Technopark from the presentation of Dmitry Grishin, which took place in November 2011 at MSTU.  The idea itself seemed interesting to me - a large IT company comes to the university and participates in preparing students.  Then I did not know what the project would be like, how difficult it would be to do, what it would give me in the end.  But I believed that this was a great opportunity, and I should not miss it. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Ilya P.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/jphoenix/" class="user_link">jphoenix</a> : ‚ÄúI just came to the university to eat dumplings (by the time I appeared there once a week) and accidentally saw an advertisement for the first set, which ended a few days ago.  About Technopark was completely unknown.  Attracted the Mail.Ru Group logo and promise to teach web development.  I wrote to the post office, passed the contest, they took me. ‚Äù <br><br><h1>  2. How was the selection? </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e09/af4/036/e09af403667e4eb6c6ccc811f094d5d5.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Maxim F</b> .: ‚ÄúIn my year, selection was made only by the results of the written part, which consisted of tests and three tasks.  They decided to refuse the oral part.  Now, as far as I know, there are more selection stages.  This is an online test, and written, and oral interview.  But it is even more interesting.  After all, an interview is a kind of audit of knowledge.  And when spaces are found, they are easier to remove. " <br><br>  <b>Nadezhda G</b> .: ‚ÄúOnline testing is a fairly quiet stage.  You can focus on the questions from the test.  But at the full-time stage, as with any interview, there was excitement and a desire to please.  The interview was conducted by Paul, and, perhaps, the most remembered - his question ‚ÄúWhat, in your opinion, is the secret of success?‚Äù.  He asked this question, probably five times in different variations.  And I stubbornly replied that the secret of success in the team.  I think so now.  Much can be achieved alone, but if there is a common goal, things are much better.  If the team is not built, a lot of time has to be spent not on productive activities, but on organizational.  By the way, one of the first problems that a Technopark student has to face is the establishment of communications in a team: one did not have time, the second relied on the first, and the third one just understood what was happening.  If you do not understand this very quickly, you can hopelessly fall behind the curriculum and overwhelm the entire session. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Maxim G</b> .: ‚ÄúThe big hall, a lot of people, a blue envelope with A4 leaves.  Questions - whether 5, or 10 pieces.  The questions were interesting because in response to each could be fantasized.  Come up with your encryption algorithm, think about random numbers, etc. Well, fantasizing is not writing code for you.  Maybe a miracle, maybe not, but I was invited to the first lesson. ‚Äù <br><br><h1>  3. First impressions from studies? </h1><br>  <b>Maxim F</b> .: ‚ÄúFirst impressions were the most positive.  I liked the attitude of teachers and their enthusiasm for the overall process.  Still: not everyone will agree to come to the university on Saturday to give a lecture to the first couple after the work week.  But it is very much bribed.  You know, the biggest thing that I‚Äôm tired of at university is when the course isn‚Äôt needed by either the teacher or the students.  He just is in the curriculum, and why - no one can explain.  And the attitude there is appropriate.  In the Technosphere this was not.  But there was a lot of fun and enthusiasm.  At the same time, all teachers were active developers, so the relevance of their knowledge only added interest to the learning process. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Konstantin S</b> .: ‚ÄúIt was difficult and interesting.  The teachers were motivated, the programs were plastic and rebuilt depending on the results, the organizers' response time to our requests was minimal, life on the internal portal was boiling, and the communication was very democratic.  The disadvantages were, where without them.  By the third set of courses the courses were not yet tested.  It was felt that the teachers did not develop a common approach and acted on their own within a fairly wide range of rules.  But all this was almost imperceptible against the background of genuine enthusiasm of students.  Fun fact: the bulk of those who burned, have reached the end.  And of those who simply fumbled, not all came ... " <br><br>  <b>Elena A.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/maerville/" class="user_link">maerville</a> : ‚ÄúProbably the most vivid (and to some extent revealing) impression is Dmitry‚Äôs first lecture, which was attended by all 60 people, the whole stream.  Then something like ‚ÄúI wondered how many of us would be left at the end‚Äù sounded out loud.  Well, the end reached 18 ". <br><br>  <b>Alexey M</b> .: ‚ÄúReal projects and tasks began.  During my studies, I came to realize that Technopark is a good opportunity to accumulate a valuable portfolio: knowledge and some projects, the code of which you can show when applying for a job. ‚Äù <br><br><h1>  4. What was the most difficult thing during your studies? </h1><br>  <b>Michael K</b> .: ‚ÄúI really wanted to sleep.  This is generally an eternal problem for the student.  It was also difficult to come to school on Saturdays.  If you have already come to the university, then it is easier to stay for a couple of hours and wait for the evening classes.  And getting up early on Saturday morning when there is no class is a challenge worse than homework.  The material was presented well, so there was no impression of supercomplexity from the lessons.  However, some lectures were furious, especially in databases.  In general, the first semester was more difficult than the second.  A lot of people dropped out (about nine out of forty people left), and the teachers were anxious about those who remained for the second semester. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Eugene S.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/e-sha/" class="user_link">e-sha</a> : ‚ÄúIt was difficult without a bit of a base.  Basic ownership of UNIX, basic theory of algorithms, programming base, OS device, and more.  The guys from the specialized departments, I think, knew this better than me.  The most difficult course for me was highload (designing high load systems). ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Alexey M</b> .: ‚ÄúThe most interesting for me was teamwork.  Another big plus Technopark - communication.  I met very interesting people.  Their distinguishing feature is the desire to move forward.  And when you get into this atmosphere, you yourself become like this (if you haven‚Äôt yet become so). ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Dinar S.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ziontab/" class="user_link">ziontab</a> : ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say that there were difficulties regarding the educational material.  When you study what you are interested in, you learn it faster.  There were difficulties with how to keep up with all this.  It happened that classes in the Technopark and the main specialty were superimposed.  Then the video lectures were made by the students themselves (this was the first set, professional video filming was not conducted yet) ‚Äù. <br><br><h1>  5. What was the most interesting while studying? </h1><br>  <b>Ilya P.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/jphoenix/" class="user_link">jphoenix</a> : ‚ÄúIt was interesting to cut course projects.  I wanted to, after putting it handy in life.  For example, <a href="http://secureshare.pw/">secureshare.pw</a> was born this <a href="http://secureshare.pw/">way</a> : it was a course project on information security, and now it's a convenient service that I and my colleagues use almost every day. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Dinar S.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ziontab/" class="user_link">ziontab</a> : ‚ÄúFirstly, oddly enough, it is the study itself.  It is very cool to receive material first-hand, from people who work every day with what they are talking about.  And secondly, this communication with students from all over the university.  Usually, when you study, you know people within your department, perhaps the faculty.  I met many people with different specialties and cooked them in a large IT porridge called Technopark. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Maxim F</b> .: ‚ÄúThe most interesting was the learning process.  I really liked the approach of teachers.  I also really liked it when the course suggested some major project that needed to be defended at the end.  The final project at the same time required the application of knowledge gained during the course.  It's nice to do something more than homework for one evening, with some idea and completeness.  I liked that when choosing assignments there was an opportunity to take the initiative and choose what is closer or more interesting to you.  At the same time, such courses assumed teaming, had to start joint repositories, share responsibilities and negotiate.  It is also useful and fascinating. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Konstantin S</b> .: ‚ÄúI really liked the feeling of the speed with which I plunged into the world of industrial programming.  Progress in knowledge was very fast and noticeable.  I liked to deal with something new, build it into your project, see how it started to work.  It was the coolest. ‚Äù <br><br><h1>  6. What is remembered besides learning? </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/0c9/99d/bf2/0c999dbf22cdc1d3162d772b72a87956.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Alexey Sh</b> .: ‚ÄúAttitude towards students, atmosphere of cooperation.  All questions were solved openly and together.  And every voice and wish was heard. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Ilya P.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/jphoenix/" class="user_link">jphoenix</a> : ‚ÄúIn addition to learning, of course, communication and new acquaintances: we became close friends and colleagues with some of our classmates, and to this day we work and relax together.  A trip to Sochi was a holiday of friendship in general: what can make people better friends than traveling and climbing a mountain? ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Maxim P.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/uwriter/" class="user_link">uwriter</a> : ‚ÄúIn addition to learning, I remember the urgent development of an application for searching photos from VKontakte immediately after the course on Android.  Even something <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.PolygonGamesStudio.UPhoto%26hl%3Dru">turned out</a> , however, advanced filters in the end did not roll out.  Well, and the general page of graduates, which I wanted to get from the moment it was opened.  I saw it straight: I show someone an aluminum diploma, a person is surprised, looks at the Technopark, comes to the graduates page, and there my page and confirmation that I really went through these two years! ‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Konstantin S</b> .: ‚ÄúConcentration of humor.  Both teachers and students burned everything almost continuously.  I don't know how to work in a different atmosphere now. ‚Äù <br><br><h1>  7. How was work and study combined? </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/2d4/d92/234/2d4d9223461035d5ed65c159a584debe.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Maxim F</b> .: ‚ÄúTo be honest, I didn‚Äôt really manage to combine work and study.  Depending on current priorities (for example, working deadline or training), it was necessary to focus more on one thing.  After all, remained and university studies.  I think that it is quite possible to combine, but this requires a lot of discipline and ability to focus.  Without this, it can be hard and have to sacrifice something.  But it's definitely worth a try.  This is a huge plus for deadlines: they make you focus and reorganize internal processes, keep track of your time, think about the quality of the already spent.  This is useful". <br><br>  <b>Alexey Sh.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/infected/" class="user_link">Infected</a> : ‚ÄúNot easy, I slept a little.  He worked as a programmer, studied in Baumanka and in Technopark ". <br><br>  <b>Anton K</b> .: ‚ÄúNot easy.  But it was possible to combine all the same, since the internship had no special requirements for the work schedule. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Elena A.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/maerville/" class="user_link">maerville</a> : ‚ÄúI <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/maerville/" class="user_link">‚Äôll</a> say right away that it was not easy.  Most of the time I spent studying directly in Baumanka (my department is considered one of the most difficult, with a rich laboratory work and coursework, curriculum), especially because I wanted to get a red diploma.  Then the second time was the work.  Again, it was not easy, because I work not quite on the profile of Technopark (rather, this is the profile of Technosphere), and at first I had to plunge and learn a lot of new things and finish my studies.  Studying in Technopark was my third priority, it resulted in the fact that I practically did not go to lectures, but preferred to learn from video recordings.  Well, and, accordingly, often went to retake.  I must say at once that such an approach is wrong, and I recommend never doing this to all applicants and students of the Technopark from the height of their experience.  For it is fraught. <br><br><h1>  8. Did studying in the project influence your career and how? </h1><br>  <b>Michael K</b> .: ‚ÄúI think it has influenced for the better, but in the long run.  I learned that professional contact is important and useful.  The fact that you need to maintain your image and image of the company.  The fact that training employees and involving them in educational projects as teachers is great.  About how the work in a large company.  About what tasks confront workers, and why knowledge from the university are important.  And in general, that any knowledge comes in handy.  The fact that there are resources that need to be distributed during product development.  About the importance of planning.  About expediency.  I think I could see the whole picture of software development.  Not the fact that I understood everything correctly.  For example, I did not remember much about databases.  But repetition is the mother of learning, and when I see similar material again, I can master it faster.  It gives me a competitive edge. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Dinar S.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ziontab/" class="user_link">ziontab</a> : ‚ÄúStudying at the Technopark gave a great start to my career.  After the first semester of studies, I got an internship at the Mail.Ru Group, in the team of Dmitry, one of the coolest teachers in Technopark.  And now, for three years I have been successfully working in this cool team.  I'm not sure that without Technopark and without work experience, I could immediately go to work at a large IT company. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Maxim P.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/uwriter/" class="user_link">uwriter</a> : ‚ÄúWithout exaggeration, I would say that studying at the Technopark radically affected my career.  If I had not gone here, by the end of the fourth year I would not have: <br><ul><li>  two years of work experience in Mail.Ru Group (everyone knows about the problem of chicken and eggs from university graduates - they don‚Äôt take work without experience, but to get experience you need to be hired); </li><li>  understanding how projects work in general; </li><li>  knowledge of how to manage development in a huge and successful company; </li><li>  teams of tough guys with whom you can take on the development of some cool project to order.  Where else in the fourth year of university you can find such as Grisha, about whom legends in the Technopark as the most multifunctional person among his graduates (each functionality, of course, is at the maximum level of competence).  Or as Serega, who not only shakes more than three of my weights (sic!), But is also able to do in a day what ordinary people do in two or three days.  Or as four more not less abrupt guys.  The main difference between these guys and the ‚Äúaverage market‚Äù is the possession of not only knowledge in their narrow field, but also a deep understanding of the rest of the web services. ‚Äù </li></ul><br><br>  <b>Alexey M</b> .: ‚ÄúThanks to Technopark, my programming career began.  In Mail.Ru Group I was engaged in testing, and now in Yandex I am engaged in development.  Without Technopark (I‚Äôll clarify: by this word I mean a team of excellent teachers and students who teach and learn) nothing would have happened, well, or it would have happened much later.  Technopark helped me find my own business, and I plan to stay in the industry and develop further. ‚Äù <br><br><h1>  9. How do you see your professional future, what's next? </h1><br>  <b>Evgeny S.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/e-sha/" class="user_link">e-sha</a> : ‚ÄúNow I am participating in a data analysis project, doing big data infrastructure, working with the data itself (Sberbank Digital Ventures).  I plan to develop in this direction, to go deep into Data Mining.  For this, by the way, I watch the lectures of the Technosphere. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Elena A.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/maerville/" class="user_link">maerville</a> : ‚ÄúWhen I was interviewed for a job in Mail.Ru Search, many people told me that this was the most interesting job, and then it‚Äôs difficult to find something similar in interest.  Now, having worked in the ranking department for two years, I can only confirm these words.  At the moment I am a student of the Master in Science in Data Program at HSE.  I am going to develop in the direction of data analysis.  The next five years just continue to work in the search.  And what's next - we'll see. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Evgeny N</b> .: ‚ÄúIn the future, I plan to develop in a new company (Avito), apply this knowledge and get new ones.  The technosphere has taught us to never stand still, not to waste free time and develop.  I hope not to lose this attitude. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Ilya P.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/jphoenix/" class="user_link">jphoenix</a> : ‚ÄúNow I‚Äôm on VK, I‚Äôm working on an advertising system, and for the time being I‚Äôll plan to develop‚Äú breadth ‚Äù: there is so much to learn and become even better.  And we'll see.  I always dreamed of not going to the office every day, working at any time of the day from anywhere in the world.  Gradually, this dream comes true.  I want to cut down my startup and actually work for myself.  In time, all dreams will come true. ‚Äù <br><br><h1>  10. What can you wish future students of the project? </h1><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/095/644/0ef/0956440ef997979591891b1abf8c4fca.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  <b>Alexey Sh</b> .: ‚ÄúIf the future student of the project is faced with a choice - go to the Technopark or find the first job in parallel with studying at the university, then I would advise if you can postpone work at least for the first year of study in the project.  So it will turn out to plunge deeper into each item and be more productive, without driving yourself into time trouble.  I also want to wish them never to follow any authority.  The authority of the red diploma, if it takes time to do what is passion.  The authority of a particular profession, if it does not deliver joy and pleasure.  Leave the templates imposed from the outside, and always look for your way! ‚Äù. <br><br>  <b>Michael K</b> .: ‚ÄúFor the future students, I first of all want to think: do you need it?  It is hard to learn, it takes a lot of time.  But the result is worth it.  I was lucky to have a good progerskuyu training, so as not to blur before the homework.  A lot of people left without finishing their studies.  It hurts me to see this, because people from the Mail.Ru Group put a lot of effort into the project. <br>  Please weigh the pros and cons before entering the Technosphere. ‚Äù <br><br>  <b>Dinar S.</b> , <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ziontab/" class="user_link">ziontab</a> : ‚ÄúLet me <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/users/ziontab/" class="user_link">give you</a> some numbers: among my classmates, eight people came to Technopark in the first set.  Gone to Technopark seven.  Five were interns at Mail.Ru Group.  And only three managed to finish the Technopark.  I have a principle: if you take on something you need to bring it to the end, otherwise you will waste your and other people's time.  I wish you a sober assessment of your time and energy.  And if you decide to enter the Technopark and finish it, I guarantee that this will be one of the most exciting events in your life, as it has become in mine. ‚Äù <br><br>  So, it was information about our projects "first-hand".  We remind you that before September 11, inclusive, you have the opportunity to apply for the selection to the <a href="https://park.mail.ru/pages/index/">Technopark</a> (for students of the Moscow State Technical University named after N. Bauman), the <a href="https://sphere.mail.ru/pages/index/">Technosphere</a> (VMK of the Moscow State University named after MV Lomonosov,) and <a href="https://track.mail.ru/pages/index/">Tehnotrek</a> (for students of the MIPT).  We are waiting for you and good luck! </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/265463/">https://habr.com/ru/post/265463/</a></p>
