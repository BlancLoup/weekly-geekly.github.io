  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúIf the roof wind blows ...‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  I can't help but post my wife's blog entry. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  PS I will forgive you forgive me, I am still not completely settled down and do not design the text very well :) <br><blockquote>  What am I a bojan? <br>  And you count how many normal people and how many abnormals (let's leave it in this wording) you meet in a day? <br>  I would prefer to leave the terminological questions aside, because here it is easy to go into demagogy.  Let's talk about specific facts. <br>  Over the two weekends, I was faced with two groups of normal people, two notorious uyebki, and a crowd of underdeveloped people from whom you do not know what to expect. <br>  To make it clear what I'm comparing with, I will explain what people seemed to me quite adequate.  For example, comrades, picnic on the shore of the lake and gently put their garbage in the bag in the trunk of your own car.  Very cultural gentlemen, it seems to me.  Or two comrades of ‚Äúsouthern appearance‚Äù, who first walked along the path past me to one side and drank beer, and then went the other way and carried empty bottles behind them, and then I met again on another path, the empty bottles were still with them.  But this junk topic is probably repeated too often.  The intrigue was not in this, but in the fact that one of these southern comrades decided to defend the need for a bush near the path (and the bushes know what bald ones are now).  So, having spotted me, he quickly put on his pants and deigned to wait until I passed, and the second one even mumbled something like an apology.  Very nice of them, I must say, because most men do not see anything awkward in blasting in front of passersby.  This topic can be developed for a long time, which I will not do.  Just take my word for it, that the result will be a conclusion about extreme licentiousness and low culture of our population. <br><br>  Now that I liked much less. <br>  The first was a man of about forty with a tail that blocked my only path by which I could leave the shore and for fifteen minutes my brain hovered on the topic that I should not wear a wedding ring and should go to visit him.  At the same time, he tried to grab my hands and other places, and I thought hard, how could I get rid of him, and why I still do not have a stun gun, because it is them who need to revive such old fagots.  Of course, this old nits were not dangerous, but the fact that a person in a sober state is able to pester with such requests to completely strangers is a confirmation of my theory that the general level of people's mental health has decreased significantly. <br><br>  The second precedent was a very ugly situation in the subway.  Active people - two boys of 14-15 years old.  In general, not even high school students, but the very same teenagers, pimply loafers, whose immature psyche had just come under the influence of hormones.  So, one of them was quite an ordinary boy with a behavior appropriate for his age: looking at girls, blushing right away, trying to make a dirty joke and blushing again - classics of the genre.  But the second!  This, I'm sorry, was something.  This little bitch, I think, completely out of her mind.  At what point he found himself in the car, I do not know.  But it coincided that at one of the stations I got out from behind the newspaper, immediately a half-empty carriage was filled with people, including a large number of girls.  And a couple of minutes started.  This little freak jumped up and ran around the carriage by all these girls, gradually beginning to mumble, and then scream: "I want ... I want ... I want ...".  Then he settled at the end of the car at the door, unbuttoned his pants and engaged in self-satisfaction.  Then he rushed around the car with his pants unbuttoned and continued to shout that he, he says, wants to fuck everyone, but no one wants him.  The people in the car, the old woman across from me, the man next to me, pretended that nothing was happening.  You know, frozen with stone faces, stumbled into their books, newspapers, advertisements on the walls, and everything seemed to be fine.  And for me so nichrome not normal.  But I alone do not associate with inadequate types: after all, I am not a candidate master of sports, and even did not go to karate.  And everyone is sitting ... Realizing that no one is going to move from a place, she left at the nearest stop.  I can not exclude the likelihood that the boy will nevertheless lower someone to the final one. <br>  And all because there is no one to take him by the throat. <br>  Well, in an amicable way, a psychiatrist needs such a child.  Where do parents look?

      I, too, began to forget how I, going into the last carriage on Mayakovka, uncovered a folding knife, and how many times I had to use it, and even how I risked being in this jail.  True, then I decided to stop selling the salmon, because such a struggle for good and justice is not very good either. <br>  So what to do?!  You can not easily go to the subway or walk.  From the house or something not to go?  So I guess that then "they will come to you" ... </blockquote><br>  What else can I add? <br>  "My hut on the edge" - the most popular reaction among people. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/6943/">https://habr.com/ru/post/6943/</a></p>
