(In Polish!) <br>  Briefly about my work in Poland: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83b/dbe/d93/83bdbed93dc4f49b0c6c5a8b27887ca1.jpg" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br>  The office in which I work, even ashamed to call the office.  It is strange that a company that has a monthly income of over one and a half million zlotys (375,000 Euros), and simply can not believe that the company does not have enough money to repair the office! <br>  Actually, I got there as an acquaintance, a friend needed a programmer for a company for a project.  At that time I was programming and learning PHP (html / css), which I already knew, just, so to speak, I didn‚Äôt check everything I forgot with time (I thought to continue my project postponed to a dusty cloud). <br>  My employer wanted a server or desktop program for recognizing (photographing) car numbers from a webcam.  When a car drives into an object, it records in the database (For further processing and reporting for accounting), when leaving it is the same procedure, recording in the database with a photo, counting the time how much the car was at the object, how many times a day, week, month I called in and drove out, various alarms (for example, if a car drove into an object and didn‚Äôt leave in 2-3 hours, or didn‚Äôt leave at all that day and vice versa, a car that didn‚Äôt drive out of the object) various statistics, etc.  features! <br>  The first month I work for a penny, 340 euros.  Then I will receive at least 500 euros, but this is too little for such a project and such a company.  After I finish the project, I will be charged a premium of 500 euros somewhere!  (Poles greedy, do not give extra money to waiters, as opposed to us). <br>  The employer included me in the project, because there are no similar free programs, and paid ones cost $ 1,500 in the aisles.  I, myself, exploded the Internet, found a library for video and image processing AForgenet.com and started writing a program in C #.  An example of a program created at the moment is taken as a screen for review (ps.: I spent 4 days since I was C # with T√∂elson a long time ago) <br>  Eats the program when displaying video, approximately, 25% of the processor and from 25 to 60 MB of RAM! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/83b/dbe/d93/83bdbed93dc4f49b0c6c5a8b27887ca1.jpg" alt="image"><br>  When the camera is rotated in the non-display mode (see below), the processor works on the screen at 2-3% of the load and Ozu steadily draws 14 mb! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/d78/bf9/51b/d78bf951b090d3fa205b305933ad423e.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The display of fraps was necessary to evaluate those webcams that are in the enterprise, or are able to work normally, as well as to check the stability of the program.  Displaying video in the program should be strictly for calibration and setup of the camera, in fact, it is not necessary, but left, perhaps the admin himself wants to see what is happening there at the bandwidth;  to record a video or screenshot. <br>  Away from the topic, it means that we are holding the chairs - the environment of robots and habitats: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/663/a31/07d/663a3107d6d4e7b0c1eeab9ff313a03b.jpg" alt="image"><br>  My computer is the closest (on the top photo): <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/605/0f7/314/6050f7314d2e110ca6e2a789ee984813.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Here we sometimes solder the boards, repair the electrical equipment, since my duties include assistance to the electrician! <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/5df/bf5/187/5dfbf51870f0824912948d6f905e34d2.jpg" alt="image"><br>  The place of the electrician (photo above), part-time programmer, who probably knows nothing except visual programming! <br>  Mini parts warehouse for electronics: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/133/eae/a2f/133eaea2fc0f0a2d52f1f57496a6b233.jpg" alt="image"><br>  And the actual server serving the local infrastructure: <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/651/152/a2e/651152a2eb31aa6c37cccd067e7b2e86.jpg" alt="image"><br>  Personally, I do not understand, how can you not look after your company?  The owner of the company in his office all overlaid the tree beautifully, with gold, on the wall behind him photos from all over the world, where only he was not, the office table, I think, made of oak, marble and gilding, is very beautiful.  Car about 100 pieces of green.  Entrance to the company inspires, but the place <br>  Workers are just creepy!  (Don't be vain and greedy) <br>  Impressions of the robots here are strange, as if a geek setting, constantly something needs to be soldered, disassembled, coded, but at the same time the design of the room kills enthusiasm.  Equipment and server power sucks, schoolchildren have home servers for the same counter or Wow, and even better at times! <br>  I think about it ... and I will say with confidence that it is good where we are not! <br>  I work only in order to gain vital, professional experience, as well as learn to work and not be lazy ... and the war in Ukraine, it would be foolish to return.  I am waiting for everything to calm down and go home, and there parents and business! <br>  ‚ÄúPeace to you!‚Äù, This is how the Hub turned out! <br>  (If anything, sorry for mistakes, if you need to add - write down what you would like to hear, I don‚Äôt always have time here, but there is:) </div>
