And it is interesting for several reasons, including because of the pricing policy. <br><br>  The device is controlled by the operating system <b>Windows Mobile 6.1</b> (which next week <a href="http://www.rovercomputers.ru/info/news/142/">can be</a> completely free to upgrade to version 6.5). Performance characteristics are as follows:

    <img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/6263/specp.png" alt="image"><br><br>  In addition to very serious parameters, the filling differs from younger brothers in more attractive design.  It became interesting to learn - and suddenly like it) <br><br><h2>  Equipment </h2><br>  In a beautiful small box the following components are hidden: <br><br>  - Communicator <b>RoverPC EvoX8</b> ; <br>  - Battery (Li-Ion, 3.7V, 1100mAh); <br>  - Network adapter; <br>  - Two stylus and USB-cord; <br>  - Stereo headphones; <br>  - Memory card for 1GB (microSD); <br>  - CD with software, user manual. <br><br><img src="http://img19.imageshack.us/img19/2439/roverpcevox813.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Well, not bad - among the software you can find Navitel Navigator version 3.2.  Manual Russian and black and white, 142 pages. <br>  But something is clearly not enough - the cover, the holder in the car and charging. <br><br>  Unusually implemented adapter for charging - on the one hand plug into the outlet, on the other hand - USB connector.  Accordingly, charging seems to be like from the network, at the same time, it can be charged from a regular port.  But one cord less. <br><br><h2>  Appearance </h2><br>  The communicator on the black case (with gray ends) has no sharp corners or edges - everything is quite smooth.  Almost the entire area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe front panel is occupied by the screen (3.2 ‚ÄùTFT, 240x400, 65 thousand colors) - only the speaker is higher (hidden behind a metal <a href="">beam</a> ), and below is the company's label and three buttons.  The buttons, by the way, are not green and red, but both are white.  Push in moderately loud and elastic.  The one between them mainly performs the ‚ÄúOK‚Äù function. <br><br><img src="http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/4893/67050559.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The screen is not sunk into the case (does not have sides) - this is done for ease of finger control.  An additional advantage of this solution is that dust does not accumulate in the corners and it is always easy to wipe the screen.  Minus - putting the device on a flat surface with the screen down, it is much easier to scratch it. <br>  On the left - the volume control buttons, on the right - the photo (below) and miniUSB-port plug. <br><br><img src="http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/8374/twon.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Personally, I got used to seeing the display off button on the place of the stub (as some manufacturers do), but in this case this button is located on the upper end. <br><br>  Below are the holes for the lace (which is a rarity lately, which is a pity), a microphone and a telescopic stylus. <br>  On the back cover (which is completely removed to access the battery or SIM card), there is the company logo, a speaker grid and a 3 megapixel camera (with integrated LED flash) on a small convex platform. <br><br><img src="http://img69.imageshack.us/img69/723/roverpcevox86.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Dimensions - 56x105x13 (in mm) with a weight of 112 grams - with battery, stylus and sim card <br><br>  In comparison with HTC HD2 ( <a href="">photo</a> with flash): <br><br><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/5213/82196926.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  In this device, you can learn some design elements from other models, but in complex it is most similar to the Samsung SGH-i900 (WiTu) :) However, this is a very independent device. <br>  Despite the well-established stereotypes that RoverComputers has a terrible build, etc., in this case this is not the case - everything is done soundly and conscientiously.  No squeaks, no backlash, no gaps or irregularities - absolutely no complaints about the assembly.  Perhaps it was just the successful model that got caught, but you can always look at the device when you buy it.  The phone is perfectly in the hand, while there is no feeling that you are holding something terrible) <br>  However, we should not forget that the case is plastic and certainly will not remain indifferent to careless bumps and scratches.  In general, as everywhere else, time will tell. <br><br><h2>  Turn on and work </h2><br>  The communicator is turned on with the button on the upper end and goes into a fully operational state in approximately 30 seconds.  Immediately after loading, a desktop appears in front of us, on which non-standard WM applications are installed.  In particular, <b>SmartToday</b> plug-in is immediately apparent - three tabs on which you can place any applications or settings. <br><br><img src="http://img187.imageshack.us/img187/351/99053622.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  With a more detailed acquaintance, you notice the inscription " <b>Spb Home</b> " in the lower right corner.  What is it?  That's right - <b>SPB Mobile Shell 3</b> ;) <br><br><img src="http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/5007/16896619.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The one that I used for a long time on my communicator.  In this case, this is the latest version - with a 3D carousel and sliding screens, on which there is almost complete freedom - if you want weather, lights, contacts, shortcuts, profiles, a clock or a player - place it all. <br><br><img src="http://img682.imageshack.us/img682/2369/26163430.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  There were no brakes in this program even on my phone (from 200 MHz), what can we say about this configuration.  This program seems to be coming from the considerations that Windows Mobile 6.1 itself implies the use of a stylus, and thanks to this software, you can only use your fingers.  This shell alone is worth a lot - perhaps most users will need nothing more than it) <br><br><img src="http://img94.imageshack.us/img94/1410/151599.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  A little later, it turns out that there are a few more solutions from <b>SPB Software</b> - in particular, the finger-oriented <b>SPB Keyboard</b> (I'm really a Resco fan, but I was able to type without addiction), as well as a couple of online toys and an <b>SPB TV</b> demo software for view central channels on the communicator screen through the network.  It is a pity that she is just a demo, so you can ignore it. <br><br>  Since the company Rover has gone a good way to equip the device with third-party programs, it is strange not to see in this list the free <b>Opera Mobile</b> browser.  The dialer interface is also the easiest - if there was a preinstalled <b>Inesoft Phone</b> there would be no fault for the software component of the phone. <br><br><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/3619/34993436.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  As I said, the bundle also includes navigation software represented by <b>Navitel Navigator 3.2</b> - this program has proven itself well for a long time - I also used it on the navigator at one time. <br>  The device has a simple accelerometer - I found out about its presence from the Marble Game game, which was installed initially.  This, of course, is not HTC's Teeter, but when there is absolutely nothing to do - you can torment yourself :) <br><br>  The screen is quite good - in most situations it will be enough (in my former P3300 it was the same, only smaller).  The sun could not be met, but I dare to suggest that, like most, it will ‚Äúfade‚Äù in the sun.  The viewing angles are quite large, but not from below - there is already almost nothing visible at 150 degrees. <br>  The volume of the external speaker is quite expected - not the loudest, but miss the call - do not miss.  Vibrating alert - medium strength. <br><br><img src="http://img707.imageshack.us/img707/6941/14303126.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  The camera is turned on by pressing the button on the side, the picture is taken by a long hold (a false positive is difficult).  The interface is quite simple, you can take photos and videos.  The maximum resolution of photos - 2048x1536, videos - 320x240. <br><br>  Sample photos: <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/7793/spic091210184649.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://img14.imageshack.us/img14/235/spic091210184754.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/7793/spic091210184649.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br> <a href=""><img src="http://img692.imageshack.us/img692/1156/spic091211213220.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://img191.imageshack.us/img191/5548/spic091211213406.jpg" alt="image"></a> <a href=""><img src="http://img17.imageshack.us/img17/2456/spic091211213811.jpg" alt="image"></a> <br><br>  For a processor with a frequency of 624 MHz, the battery capacity of 1100 mAh will not be enough, and if you take into account the screen size ... however, with inactive use (about 20 minutes of talk a day and something else trifle), the unit runs for about two days.  With my pace, he confidently lasted a day, but he certainly would not have enough for the latter.  On the Internet, they write that in player mode it works a little over 11 hours. <br><br><img src="http://img687.imageshack.us/img687/3092/46298373.jpg" alt="image"><br><br>  Speaking of playback, if it comes to video, then non-converted files with a resolution of 640x480 go to Core Player without brakes, more should be converted. <br><br><h2>  Check weighing </h2><br>  <u>pros</u> <br>  - A good grade; <br>  - At this time, high-quality assembly; <br>  - Good performance - 600+ MHz is enough for a wide range of tasks; <br>  - A couple of interesting pre-installed programs; <br>  - Large screen and built-in camera; <br>  - Relatively low price. <br><br>  <u>Minuses</u> <br>  - I would like a cover in the kit) and a mount in the car; <br>  - A small battery life (with a very active mode of operation - 1+ days); <br>  - Lack of a standard headphone jack; <br>  - Small viewing angle from below; <br>  - Does not work in 3G networks; <br>  - No reset button. <br><br>  About headphones - they are included for miniUSB, but they are not the best for music.  An adapter for good ears can be easily found, but still, somehow, non-universally, or something (although earlier there was such a thing on all HTC). <br>  Although the communicator never hung up during the tests and did not even hint at it, the software reset button is not superfluous. <br><br>  The cost starts from 11,000 rubles.  Price dynamics: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/847/1a3/71c/8471a371c21de828007cc85c38369a36.png" alt="image"><br><br>  <a href="http://www.sotovik.ru/catalog/reviews/RoverPC-Evo-X8-rev.html">This</a> link is the most detailed review + 3D-model. <br><br><h2>  Total </h2><br>  I like RoverComputers with my optimism :) Not afraid to compete with larger manufacturers of communicators and this is commendable.  They may not be fond of innovations, but still, in this model, a confident step forward is noticeable.  What did the company offer this time? <br>  This time there is just a nice model.  Considering its rather powerful hardware component and a very stuffed software, we can safely say that the buyer will get a very functional device, with the price of which it is very difficult to find something from "famous" counterparts.  By the way, do not be on this device identification marks - many users will not suspect anything;) <br><br><img src="http://bit.ly/7CMrQ7" alt="image"><br><br>  My old <s>sweater</s> <a href="http://twitter.com/Boomburum">tweet</a> ) HTC HD2 review and followers will soon be the first to read it) <br><br>  <b>Good luck and have a great weekend!</b> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/78031/">https://habr.com/ru/post/78031/</a></p>
