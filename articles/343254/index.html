In this article we want to tell you a little theory about the Azure Stack, which has become available relatively recently.  Under the cut, you will also find a description of possible scenarios for using the product and an invitation to one of the largest Russian events from Microsoft, Digital Business Platform. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/jj/e1/by/jje1byt0gr1rweldberftxfupzw.jpeg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  On July 10, 2017, Mike Neil, corporate vice president, Azure Infrastructure and Management, announced that Microsoft Azure Stack shipments will begin in September 2017.  The final version of the Azure Stack was provided to Microsoft hardware partners ( <a href="https://news.hpe.com/hpe-makes-deploying-hybrid-cloud-easier-with-september-shipping-of-hpe-proliant-for-microsoft-azure-stack/">HPE</a> , <a href="https://blog.dellemc.com/en-us/drawing-inspiration-partners-microsoft-inspire/">Dell EMC</a> and <a href="http://www.lenovofiles.com/docs/thinkagile-for-mas-blog.html">Lenovo</a> and some others) so that they can begin the certification process for their integrated systems.  For more information, including pricing and ordering options, see <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-azure-stack-is-ready-to-order-now/">Mike Neal's blog</a> . <br><br>  Here‚Äôs what the Azure Stack integrated systems offered by Microsoft hardware partners look like.  Here are test samples of Azure Stack Integrated Hardware Systems.

    <img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/hf/lf/fp/hflffp8-xjayfpezzhm3_1et30g.png"><br><br><h2>  What is the Azure Stack? </h2><br>  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/overview/azure-stack/">Azure Stack</a> is a hybrid cloud solution that allows you to run Azure services in an organization‚Äôs own data center, and therefore get convenient development, management and security tools similar to Azure's public cloud services.  Azure Stack is an Azure extension.  This solution allows you to work with Azure services in local environments, and if necessary, switch to using the Azure public cloud. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/7l/mj/lb/7lmjlbsez-qifzykjp1qloyjfds.png"><br><br>  Azure Stack allows you to deploy and use two types of services ‚Äî IaaS (‚Äúinfrastructure as a service‚Äù) and PaaS (‚Äúplatform as a service‚Äù) - using the same tools as in the Azure public cloud. <br><br>  Azure Stack services can be managed using PowerShell or a web portal ‚Äî in both cases, the interfaces and capabilities are similar to those in Azure.  The following is what a virtual machine preparation and management tool looks like in the Azure Stack.  As you can see, it looks the same as in Azure. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/4z/5o/q6/4z5oq65hxf-xojzsypjnzk4tkpq.png"><br><br>  Jeffrey Snover, chief architect of the Enterprise Cloud Group, which runs the Azure Stack platform, as well as the product lines of the Windows Server, System Center and Operations Management Suite, believes that Azure Stack is one of the most innovative Microsoft products ever company history.  According to him, this is the first product of a completely new category - a hybrid cloud platform.  The purpose of this product is to help companies accelerate the digital transformation, but to implement it as it is convenient for them.  The cloud is not considered as a specific solution, but as a model.  Azure Stack allows an organization to pay less attention to supporting tasks (such as managing the local IT infrastructure) and more ‚Äî to core business. <br><br><h2>  Azure Stack Usage Options </h2><br>  Azure Stack will help companies solve the most complex IT business problems, including ensuring data security, their sovereignty and compliance.  These solutions also allow you to create high-performance analytical systems, perform calculations and run Azure applications in stand-alone or isolated environments, and prepare a platform for developing modern applications. <br><br><h4>  Ensuring data security, sovereignty and compliance </h4><br>  Azure Stack allows you to perform the same service on devices in several countries, as when using the cloud, but at the same time ensure the sovereignty of data by deploying the same application in a data center in each individual country, which means processing data within government boundaries. <br><br><h4>  Providing maximum performance and data transfer speed </h4><br>  The public cloud is not always suitable for running applications that require the highest performance and speed of receiving and transmitting data. <br>  For example, to analyze a large amount of data from your data center in the cloud, you first need to upload this data to the cloud.  This can take a long time - sometimes it is prohibitively long in terms of internal business processes or competitiveness. <br><br><h4>  Edge deployments and isolated mode of use </h4><br>  In some cases, it is required to perform calculations and run Azure applications in stand-alone or stand-alone environments that do not connect to the data center for long periods of time.  Here are some examples of such environments: ships, submarines, mines, remote objects without reliable communication channels. <br><br><h4>  Developing applications specifically for the cloud </h4><br>  Cloud-oriented applications are designed to run as microservices in many different environments.  Developers are unlikely to like the need to use different development tools for different microservices just because they are executed in different environments.  The fastest and most effective option is to develop an application using a complete set of tools and then deploy it where it is needed.  Azure Stack and Azure are API compatible, so there‚Äôs no such problem. <br><br><h2>  Azure Stack cloud model </h2><br>  The local IT infrastructure allows you to create a secure and manageable environment for business solutions, but using such an infrastructure requires solving many tasks, including configuration, deployment, backup and management.  Most of the work time of IT administrators is spent precisely on solving these tasks ‚Äî simply for local environments to work.  Working with Azure Stack is different from using public cloud resources (for example, Azure): in order to successfully deploy and use Azure Stack, representatives of the organization will need to understand what requirements are placed on the system. <br><br>  In the course of further development of the Azure Stack, we pay the most attention to the following IT tasks.  For IT administrators, they are the most important, the most complex and the longest, so Microsoft considers the simplification of these very tasks to be the most important goal. <br><br><h4>  Managing Available Resources </h4><br>  Ensuring the ability of the IT infrastructure to handle the load, referring to cloud resources if necessary. <br><br><h4>  Tracking and maintaining health </h4><br>  Simple and effective tools for monitoring, disaster recovery, security and business continuity. <br><br><h4>  Resource Management </h4><br>  IT infrastructure can be considered effective only if users are satisfied with the work of services, and you can successfully use them and provide users with continuous access to them. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/iv/9a/59/iv9a59cpyvmlx54pghvmfc5hgjk.jpeg"><br><br><h2>  Additional materials on Azure Stack </h2><br><ul><li>  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/microsoft-azure-stack-is-ready-to-order-now/">Microsoft Azure Stack can be ordered now</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/">Azure Stack Documentation</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/videos/azure-and-azure-stack-working-together-build-2017/">Azure Stack Edge and Standalone Solutions: Demo</a> </li><li>  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/operating-azure-stack/">Azure Stack Operation</a> </li></ul><br><hr><br>  And if you want to learn more about Azure Stack, we invite you on November 30 to the key event of the first half of the year - the Microsoft Digital Platform Business Forum. <br><br> <a href="http://msplatform.ru/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/webt/xi/_1/kv/xi_1kvq0cpwiat_e8uwgqi800li.jpeg"></a> <br><br>  The forum will cover three main aspects of creating a successful business: economic efficiency, technological capabilities and trust in the business environment. <br><br>  These topics are discussed in a plenary report, discussed in the framework of three face-to-face tracks for managers and are disclosed in detail within 28 online reports for information technology professionals.  Technological reports will be available exclusively in the framework of a live broadcast in the virtual forum environment. <br><br>  The event will feature: Microsoft Azure, Azure Stack, SQL Server 2017, Microsoft 365 and Dynamics 365. <br><br>  To participate in the forum you need to <a href="http://msplatform.ru/">register</a> .
