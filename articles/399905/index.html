  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Find my car: autoblockchain HashCoins against hijackings and "not a bit, not beautiful" ads</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  On Monday, <a href="https://www.hashcoins.com/">HashCoins</a> , in the blog of which you are reading this news, <a href="http://forklog.com/komanda-hashcoins-predstavila-servis-ucheta-transportnyh-sredstv-na-blokchejne-emercoin/">announced the</a> accounting service for vehicles and their components, built on the blockchain <a href="http://emercoin.com/">Emercoin</a> .  The project has already been <a href="http://hashcoins.ru/storage/app/media/files/car_registry_present_rus.pdf">presented to the</a> government of one of the Baltic countries and negotiations are underway with two global automakers. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/geektimes/post_images/192/183/7b9/1921837b908cdd118ea1a5deb027a623.png" alt="image"><br>  <i>A specially designed computer simulation demonstrates what the car owner will look like, whose car is listed in the autoblockch.</i> <br><br>  In short, you can keep records and history of any vehicles on autoblockch, from motorcycles and cars to boats and airplanes, as well as their components, including motors and expensive electronic components, history of changes in their owners, insurance claims, etc.  - depriving the meaning of virtually any fraud with them from hijacking to "never broken, I swear by my mother" on the car market. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h2>  Who needs it </h2><br>  There are a number of organizations that will be interested in the autoblockchain:

    <ul><li>  government agencies involved in the accounting of cars (in Russia it is the traffic police), </li><li>  Insurance companies, </li><li>  automakers and car services, </li><li>  companies with a large number of cars (taxi companies, courier services, retail chains), </li><li>  manufacturers of any movable equipment, up to tractors, engines and aircraft, which are subject to one or another method of accounting. </li></ul><br>  For example, mopeds with engines of less than 50 cubes in Russia are not required to be considered.  And everything that has a passport or technical book can be useful accounting in the blockchain.  In Europe and especially in the USA, for example, the subject of light aircraft is relevant, and in Norway, river transport is very popular - and very often small-engine boats are hijacked.  They, too, are sometimes hijacked, interrupted by numbers or simply curled up, etc.  - in general, everything relevant to cars is relevant for them.  For example, insurers can enter data on any insurance claims to the autoblockch. <br><br><h2>  How it will work </h2><br>  The more organizations adapt the autoblockch in their activities, the more effective its results will be. Theoretically, the conventional ‚Äúlarge German automaker‚Äù can once and for all solve the problem of car thefts and even disassembly into components, simply once having introduced a blockchain into which all new products will be recorded. for example, since 2018 cars in the blockchain, including motor data, hash codes from the ROM of automotive electronics devices, and so on and so forth.  You can say it will be an analogue of the technology Find my phone for a smartphone. <br><br>  Therefore, the trick with a hijacked car, according to the broken numbers registered somewhere in the North Caucasus, is no longer a ride - or a ride with very careless customers.  Or those who buy a stolen car under the order - but there is not much to be in this, because the very first attempt by the insurance, auto service or the same traffic police to verify the data about the stolen car with the autoblockchain will burn the "impostor" with the broken numbers to the full.  Any bona fide purchaser can do the same by <a href="">using the search</a> directly at the car market, at a car dealership, or even in correspondence with the seller at Avito, simply asking him to drop a link to <a href="http://auto.hashcoins.com/detail/KLF123NFT4KAS1087HCD/">the car page on the blockchain</a> . <br><br>  Moreover, if traffic police simply provide protection against frauds with their databases, transferring information to the blockchain, other interested organizations will be able to store additional information important to them: for example, by drivers, mileage - up to taking into account all THAT and replacing branded stickers on bodywork. <br><br><h2>  Monetization </h2><br>  The only paid service in the autoblocker is to create a new record there, which costs up to 0.3 emc (8 cents) and less.  This board is installed algorithmically and is only needed to protect the Emergency network from spam.  Earn HashCoins and Emercoin plan on introducing autoblockchain. <br><br><ul><li>  For large customers, such as automakers, it will be worthwhile to train their own employees so that they themselves will further centrally integrate autoblockchain into their processes. </li><li>  Turnkey solutions will be created for smaller companies that do not have or afford their blockchain development staff and, most likely, some ready-made boxed or SaaS solutions will appear. </li></ul><br><h2>  "Automakers came to us themselves" </h2><br>  In addition to interested government agencies, HashCoins and Emercoin have already submitted their autoblockchain to two <i>very</i> large global automakers.  And the most curious thing here is that in both cases it happened on the initiative of the auto giants themselves, whose representatives entered Emercoin, becoming interested in the company's projects even on previous announcements - for example, on <a href="http://www.nasdaq.com/article/raketa-watches-trials-blockchain-technology-to-fight-counterfeiting-cm645847">integration with the ‚ÄúRocket‚Äù watch factory</a> . <br><br><h2>  New ecosystem </h2><br>  The openness of the blockchain, the totality and versatility of the data stored there will give room for creativity in interpreting and applying them - dozens of start-ups may emerge that will apply and extend the big data stored in autoblockchain in ways that we now cannot imagine.  Maybe you have an idea? </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/399905/">https://habr.com/ru/post/399905/</a></p>
