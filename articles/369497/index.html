  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Samsung Charm - one of the inconspicuous innovations and the cheapest fitness tracker *</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  <i>* In the Samsung lineup, of course.</i>  However, the company seems to be convinced that the gadget will have its place in the niche, and since the entrance to the domestic market was really not very loud, we decided to tell about this female device.  Well, also because the girls are attracted by all the pretty ones.  And I already wrote about smart jewelry. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/04e/943/f04/04e943f047684d8e902fe999ff32b252.jpg"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Charm appeared in some countries at the beginning of the year, after the announcement at the MWC, and <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/interesnye-gadzhety/samsung-charm.html%3Futm_source%3Dgkt%26utm_medium%3Dcharm%26utm_campaign%3Dcharm">they began to</a> plan tracker sales in Russia <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/interesnye-gadzhety/samsung-charm.html%3Futm_source%3Dgkt%26utm_medium%3Dcharm%26utm_campaign%3Dcharm">in May</a> .  It appeared, probably, on the wave of a general interest in inexpensive fitness trackers that could form an opposition to the first Mi Band, such as Withings Go. <br><br>  Despite the fact that the company Charm is endowed with an epithet of jewelry, it seems that it does not pretend to a niche <a href="https://geektimes.ru/company/medgadgets/blog/263626/">smart jewelry</a> , if only because of a silicone bracelet.  Nevertheless, Samsung prudently made the sensor removable, possibly for future accessories.  One way or another, Charm, or ‚Äúthe first mi Band at the price of the second,‚Äù began <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/samsung-smart-charmy.html%3Futm_source%3Dgkt%26utm_medium%3Dcharm%26utm_campaign%3Dcharm">to be sold</a> relatively unnoticed <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/samsung-smart-charmy.html%3Futm_source%3Dgkt%26utm_medium%3Dcharm%26utm_campaign%3Dcharm">in Russia at the official price of 2,490 rubles</a> .

      <br>
      The premiere was quiet, probably due to the fact that almost in parallel the long-awaited <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/samsung-gear-fit-2.html%3Futm_source%3Dgkt%26utm_medium%3Dcharm%26utm_campaign%3Dgearfit2">Gear Fit 2 with GPS appeared</a> , which they began to advertise and encourage in every way long before the release, spreading rumors and preparing fertile soil. <br><br>  <b>Charm</b> <br><br>  Definitely the gadget is addressed to the female part: it is light, thin, and the sensor is more like a semiprecious pebble, smooth, symmetrical, in general, ‚Äúpretty‚Äù.  It is sold in a round small package, inside of which only a branded docking station is inside the accessories, yes, they didn‚Äôt even put their cable.  At the same time, the audience of female geeks is not considered as a potential one: rather, it may surprise those who have accidentally entered the salon of communication with a Samsung smartphone. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/b65/c39/619/b65c3961979d4b72b3ab2350fafe2079.jpg"><br><br>  The sensor, of course, is removed from the bracelet: just turn it slightly;  then it can be placed for charging in the appropriate accessory. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/6d9/1b5/43b/6d91b543be5946b8a2ed92743b986d78.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Synchronization</b> <br><br>  The device works only with Android smartphones.  At the same time to work with fitness statistics you need to use the application <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.sec.android.app.shealth%26hl%3Dru">SHealth</a> , which recently, by the way, has been <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/obzory/prilogeniya_dlia_sporta/android/samsung-s-health.html%3Futm_source%3Dgkt%26utm_medium%3Dcharm%26utm_campaign%3Dshealth">updated</a> .  The fact that the data is tightened with Charm can be observed by pulling down to update, and on the side: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/805/f3b/0a1/805f3b0a17d045afbf0a97e5eb9aca0c.png"><br><br>  However, in order to get into it, you need to overcome the stage in the form of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dcom.samsung.android.app.scharm%26hl%3Dru">the Charm application</a> .  After installation and launch, the application will start searching for a bracelet, then the sensor will light up with one of the colors, and ask the application to clarify which ones.  So they are synchronized. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e5d/be8/278/e5dbe827858445b49fbf8dc32aaca27b.jpg"><br><br>  By and large, you no longer need the Charm application: the only thing you can configure is notifications.  In the special menu, you can select applications, notifications of which you would like to see.  About them the sensor will report diode illumination.  The blue light will flash for ten minutes, but no vibro-memo - no. <br><br>  - <i>Applications are Russified, just the basic language of the smartphone with which the device was synchronized, English.</i> <br><br>  <b>What tracks</b> <br><br>  Charm is frankly "poor" in function.  For example, there is no sleep tracker.  It is possible that this is somehow due to the fact that the company plans to launch a separate <a href="http://www.samsung.com/ru/news/local/sleepsense">SleepSense</a> sleep tracker on the market.  That is, Charm is an accessory for tracking physical activity at a level: counting steps, calories and distance. <br><br>  <b>Specifications</b> <br><br><ul><li>  Size: 18.2 x 18.2 x 6.5 mm </li><li>  LED indication </li><li>  Battery capacity: 17 mAh </li><li>  Work time: up to 14 days </li><li>  Sensors: accelerometer </li><li>  Compatibility: Android 4.4 and up </li><li>  Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.0 </li></ul><br><br>  Currently, the bracelet is available in three versions: pink, gold (with a white strap), black.  The battery life is stated around two weeks, however, the instructions recommend charging the tracker at least once a week! <br><br>  <b>Pedometer</b> <br><br>  We have to admit: we have a pedometer.  The easiest, but beautiful.  We are familiar with similar functions so long ago that, if we start to remember, we will have to admit that we have become rather old.  Yes, it is stylish, but it is still difficult to position it as an accessory: after all, a silicone strap ... <br><br>  As a smart assistant, he also does not seem universal in view of the limited display capabilities.  And the main competitive advantage - the ‚Äúsmallest‚Äù has already been encountered.  If you remember, the creators of the <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/goccia-samyj-malen-kij-i-prostoj-treker-aktivnosti-v-mire.html%3Futm_source%3Dgkt%26utm_medium%3Dcharm%26utm_campaign%3Dgoccia">tracker Goccia</a> spoke with the same appeal.  And where are they now? <br><br>  So far, the main purchase motives are seen as a gift, and the price is, in principle, sparing: <a href="http://medgadgets.ru/shop/samsung-smart-charmy.html%3Futm_source%3Dgkt%26utm_medium%3Dcharm%26utm_campaign%3Dcharm">2 490 rubles</a> .  Only here until the holidays far away. <br><br>  <b>Eventually</b> <br><br>  The story here is curious, and the question ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù Does not leave.  Samsung is no stranger to the wearable device market - since 2013, it has been giving out gadgets that are becoming leaders, and here it is a regular pedometer with a twinkle.  At the same time admitted to sale almost immediately with Gear Fit 2 and in parallel to the update of Gear S2. <br><br>  It is likely that for Samsung it is an image gadget that they didn‚Äôt do on the wave of the first Fitbit, Jawbone, and now they just put an end to, having spent some time.  Should I buy it?  Feels like this is either a souvenir or a piece to the collection of loyal fans of the brand. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369497/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369497/</a></p>
