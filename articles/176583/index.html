Google also started distributing the Play store, our colleague shared his experience on how to increase downloads by playing on the name of the application, and the author of SQUIDS calculated how much money actually brings mobile games (debunking, along the way, five established myths). <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/90d/ba7/7eb/90dba77eb44fe9c50df72ab7ed7da864.gif" alt="image"><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h4>  iOS </h4>

      <b>Apple has removed AppGratis from the App Store</b> <br>  <a href="http://appgratis.com/blog/2013/04/09/appgratis-pulled-from-the-app-store-heres-the-full-story/">Commentary by Simon Davlat (eng)</a> / <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/apple/appgratis-zabanili-za-prodvijenie-i-push.html">For what (rus)</a> / <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/apple/appgratis-ne-posledniy.html">AppGratis is not the last (rus)</a> / <a href="http://techyjeremy.tumblr.com/post/47783569514/appgratis-is-nothing-more-than-a-black-hat-marketing">AppGratis is no more than a Black Hat marketing company (eng)</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/566/8f4/4da/5668f44daae83832839d9844f3eb46df.gif" alt="image"><br>  Removing AppGratis was just the beginning, and Apple will continue cleaning the App Store after that.  The French startup, which recently received $ 13.5 million for the development of its search platform and application promotion, was removed from the store last week for breaking the rules.  According to sources who have spoken with AllThingsD, soon many other applications will follow the French during the general cleaning of the App Store. <br><br>  <b>Money and App Store</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176435/">Rus</a> <br>  As for money: despite the fact that SQUIDS did not make developers rich, revenues from the iOS version almost covered the development costs, and there is hope that the subsequent release on other platforms will make the title profitable and allow developing a sequel to it. <br><br>  <b>Correct names and helpful errors</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/papabubadiop/blog/175929/">Rus</a> <br>  App name.  I didn‚Äôt really believe that the number of downloads depends on the icon or name.  On the first point, I remain in the same faith, but by the names of my opinion has changed.  Yes, names matter and here are two examples, free and paid. <br><br>  <b>How Megapolis became the most profitable game of the App Store</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/kak-megapolis-stal-samoy-pribyilnoy-igroy-app-store.html">Rus</a> <br>  Social Quantum is a Russian company specializing in social games.  Now Megapolis town planning sim from Social Quantum is on the 9th place in the list of the most profitable games of the American App Store, despite the fact that it is the first ‚ÄúEnglish-speaking‚Äù Social Quantum game on iOS. <br><br>  <b>Google got rid of UDID in AdMob SDK for iOS</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/google-udid-admob-sdk-ios.html">Rus</a> <br>  Google has updated the AdMob SDK for iOS and the main purpose of this is to get rid of the UDID. <br><br><h4>  Android </h4><br><br>  <b>Resources every Android developer should know about</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175825/">Rus</a> <br>  As Android continues its incredible growth, more and more programmers are starting to develop applications on this platform.  If you start your journey today, then you are definitely lucky.  In recent years, Android has matured significantly and got rid of many childhood diseases.  Information on the platform is more than enough.  I will tell you about the most important resources. <br><br>  <b>Basics of security of the Android operating system.</b>  <b>Core level</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/175517/">Rus</a> <br>  The most common operating system for smartphones today is Android.  But not only this fact stirs interest in her.  Openness, the ability to adjust something, tweak, and, of course, also break down to a large extent contribute to the increasing popularity of this platform.  I will try to share the experience of how this operating system is arranged, as well as consider the security system. <br><br>  <b>Microsoft, Nokia and Oracle have filed a complaint with the European Commission on the monopoly of Android applications from Google</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176035/">Rus</a> <br>  In Europe, it seems, another antimonopoly trial is coming, only this time regarding the ‚ÄúCorporation of Good‚Äù, i.e.  Google (by the way, this phrase, ‚ÄúCorporation of Good,‚Äù I see less and less in the media, in relation to Google).  According to Microsoft, Nokia, Oracle and other authors of the lawsuit (who make up the Fairsearch Europe group), Google is playing an unfairly competitive game thanks to Android. <br><br>  <b>Announced a new version of Google Play (Google Play 4.0)</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176135/">Rus</a> <br>  Google has launched a phased update of Google Play.  The new version, as far as can be judged, has a more or less minimalist design, which is quite different from the previous version.  In general, there were no problems with this before, but now it is even easier to quickly find the necessary section, since the interface is quite friendly. <br><br>  <b>Basics of security of the Android operating system.</b>  <b>Native user space, part 1</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176131/">Rus</a> <br>  In this article I will try to consider security a little higher than the kernel, namely: how security works in Native user space.  We will touch on the theme of the operating system boot process and consider the structure of the Android file system. <br><br>  <b>Basics of Android NDK on the example of working with OpenAL</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176559/">Rus</a> <br>  Recently, I have been developing applications for Android, in particular, developing games.  It so happened that for one project I had to work with Android ndk.  In principle, it is impossible to consider all the difficulties and nuances of working with native in one article, I decided to write a small introduction to ndk in this article.  And so that the article was interesting not only for beginners, I will show how to work with OpenAL and WAV, OGG formats. <br><br>  <b>The researcher demonstrated the interception of control of the aircraft using an Android application</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/company/apps4all/blog/176381/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/267/10e/f0e/26710ef0ea5a2ffc13411422f81dbbd6.jpg" alt="image"><br>  At the Hack In The Box conference in Amsterdam, Hugo Teso, a security consultant from n.runs AG, presented a completely reliable scenario of hijacking an airplane using a simple Android application. <br><br>  <b>The most common Android devices</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/google/samyie-rasprostranennyie-ustroystva-na-android.html">Angl</a> <br>  Android and iOS are relentlessly fighting in the US, but in the Android world, they are confidently winning.  The Google platform dominates sales, but which devices are popular in different countries? <br><br><h4>  Development </h4><br><br>  <b>PlayScript</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176323/">Rus</a> <br>  PlayScript is an open source project, which is an ActionScript-compatible compiler and a Flash-compatible runtime environment that runs on Mono .NET and is designed to create mobile applications using MonoTouch and Mono for Android.  The combination of Adobe FlashBuilder for creating web applications and Xamarin Studio for mobile will allow you to develop multiplatform applications using all the advantages of IDE data, as well as the ability to access native APIs on mobile platforms. <br><br>  <b>Two new ways to increase the duration of gaming sessions</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/articles/applications/dva-novyih-sposoba-uvelichit-prodoljitelnost-igrovyih-sessiy.html">Rus</a> <br>  Mobile games are great for the generation of attention deficit.  Is the game not fun enough?  Find another.  And tomorrow will be even more!  Making the players stay is an extremely difficult task. <br><br>  <b>Balance in the games of the genre of Tower Defense (part 2)</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/173913/">Part 1</a> / <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176355/">Part 2</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/2f4/60d/f96/2f460df9666b93dd1133c1f82aae10eb.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In this article we will touch on the topic of creating new types of towers according to the principle ‚Äúfrom the considered situation to the unit‚Äù, we will tell about the calculation of creep parameters and give a description of bonuses. <br><br>  <b>Cisimple makes it easy to build, test, and deploy applications.</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/articles/applications/cisimple.html">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/b52/6e5/43d/b526e543d6b259ef69f7f088e7b26cff.png"><br>  Cisimple, a startup that helps automate the creation, testing, and deployment of mobile applications, today completed the beta test of its platform and made it available to all developers.  The company was also among the first to integrate the Kickfolio API, another new startup that transfers iOS applications to browsers using HTML5. <br><br>  <b>65 statistics from the world of mobile games to impress friends</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176569/">Rus</a> <br>  Here it is, a bunch of statistics of the mobile gaming industry that will make you very popular at the next gaming conference, or cocktail party, when a skeptic asks you ... <br><br>  <b>Virality is key to business application success.</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/articles/applications/viralnost-klyuchevoy-faktor-uspeha-biznes-prilojeniy.html">Rus</a> <br>  Given the limitations of their target audience, business application developers simply cannot use the techniques that bring success to consumer application development companies.  Why it happens?  And, more importantly, how can mobile business applications make user engagement more effective? <br><br>  <b>Life after going to stor.</b>  <b>Cases</b> <br>  Presentation from our Forum, which took place last Friday. <br><div class="slideshow"><iframe src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/18231589&amp;xid=17259,15700022,15700186,15700191,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhiF5-npp31TBkPVCl7M3NCxlji5uw" width="425" height="355" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe></div><br><br><h4>  Money </h4><br><br>  <b>Canalys: stores earned $ 2.2 billion in Q1, Google and Apple continue to dominate the app market</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/canalys-q1-2013.html">Rus</a> <br>  The App Store and Goole Play continue to dominate mobile app stores, while BlackBerry and Windows Phone remain ‚Äúdistant competitors.‚Äù  The data from Canalys suggests that in the first quarter of 2013, the number of downloads in the four largest app stores in the world was 13.4 billion, they earned $ 2.2 billion from the sale of paid apps, in-app sales and subscriptions.  Despite the fact that Google has bypassed Apple as the largest platform for smartphones, Apple is still the undisputed monetization leader: Google Play owns 51% of all downloads (6.8 billion), but the App Store owns 74% of all revenue ($ 1.6 billion) . <br><br>  <b>New crowdfunding word: the creators of WriteOn!</b>  <b>raise money for game advertising</b> <br>  <a href="http://apps4all.ru/news/applications/sozdateli-writeon-sobirayut-dengi-na-reklamu.html">Rus</a> <br>  Israeli golden fingers developers decided to use the crowdfunding website Indiegogo to finance their project in an unusual way - they will not use the collected funds to create a game WriteOn !, it has already been created and is available for free on the App Store, but for marketing and advertising. <br><br>  <b>British authorities have launched an investigation into the case of in-game purchases in children's freemium games</b> <br>  <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/post/176529/">Rus</a> <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/storage2/8b7/687/34b/8b768734bd7e040c54ab1e7196e9f951.jpg" alt="image"><br>  In some cases, there are not very pleasant situations, for example, when a boy from the UK in 15 minutes scored virtual goods for 1989 euros in Zombies vs Ninja, or a girl spent 1055 euros for half an hour playing My Little Pony. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/176583/">https://habr.com/ru/post/176583/</a></p>
