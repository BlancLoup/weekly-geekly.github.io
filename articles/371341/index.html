But in the summer the backpack becomes a hot burden, and in general you want not to tie yourself even with wires.  I decided that now is the right time to conduct an experiment - I left the house only with a smartphone and a bicycle, since the bicycle allows charging the smartphone. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  More people in the store are paying with wireless technology, and some with a smartphone.  Much less often, I see someone paying for transport as well.  First of all, in order to pay for transport in Moscow, it is required to change the sim-card, which already cuts off part of those who wish (as well as part of the readers, since the discussion below is only about Moscow).  But this did not stop me, and a couple of years ago I hardly found a suitable card in the cabin of Megaphone.  But it was at the dawn of the appearance of the service, perhaps now it will be easier, since at least the employees already know that there is such a service. <br><br>  Having connected the service, I discovered several drawbacks.  First: it‚Äôs impossible to pass through several passengers in ground transportation, it‚Äôs for some reason you need to wait a few minutes after the passage, and in the subway I managed to spend a few people putting my smartphone on.  Second: a small overpayment compared to the usual ‚ÄúOne‚Äù and especially with <a href="http://troika.mos.ru/tariffs/table/">TaT</a> , although now it is not so noticeable.  The idea to fix the cons did not leave me.  The phone with the ‚ÄúMobile ticket‚Äù service is essentially becoming the same ‚ÄúTroika‚Äù and the solution is obvious, you need to record ‚ÄúOne‚Äù on the phone.  But how? <br><br>  Different methods were tried, the very first one failed - at the checkout.  I went to the subway ticket office and asked to record 60 trips to the phone, pulling it out the window, the women were frightened and refused.  Then there were attempts to write with the help of Eleksnet machines, but also not successful, the phone could not be read, even if it was held for a long time, and lately their Troika replenishment service is completely ‚Äútemporarily unavailable‚Äù.

      Then I <a href="https://habrahabr.ru/article/257311/">discovered the</a> application <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details%3Fid%3Dru.bm.transport">‚ÄúMy travel card‚Äù</a> , which allows replenishing the ‚ÄúTroika‚Äù by attaching it to a mobile phone.  But the first attempts were unsuccessful, since all the phones in the district, although they supported NFC, did not allow reading either the <b>‚ÄúMobile ticket‚Äù</b> on my phone or the ‚ÄúTroika‚Äù itself.  And only the son Sony Z1 bought allowed to get the result, they put <b>‚ÄúMy travel card‚Äù</b> on the son‚Äôs phone, and putting my phone to his, bought 60 trips for the determined ‚ÄúThree‚Äù.  We checked at the MCC, it‚Äôs the trips that were written off, not the rubles from the Mobile Ticket.  We also bought another TAT 60 trips to ground transportation and everything went well too, they were written off on the bus, not trips from the ‚ÄúUnited‚Äù or rubles. <br><br>  After this, a week-long experiment began on rest in Moscow on bicycles with telephones, here the ‚Äúsummer‚Äù came at the end of July.  We spent half the day on the wheels, paying only with phones, and the second behind the computers playing open- <a href="https://ioquake3.org/">source Q3TA</a> .  Played on all already forgotten maps and traveled all parks, lakes, bays of Moscow.  I want to say that for the year the situation with bicycles on transport has improved, for example, elevators on the MCC have earned, much can still be fixed, but this is a topic for a separate post. <br><br>  For a week in most places it was possible to pay by simply attaching the phone.  I think this contributed to the sensational law on online cash registers, even in stalls with shawarma they changed cash to new ones with the support of payWave, PayPass.  Only in two cases, the lack of cash did not allow us to receive the necessary immediately, but this did not become our problem, rather the problem of those who did not set such a cash desk.  The experiment showed that NFC phones can already be actively used, at least in Moscow, you can only carry a phone with you.  The experiment continues. <br><br>  ‚ÄúTroika‚Äù on the phone could have paid for the planetarium, but all the advantages of this method would have been destroyed by the fact that you can only pay for one, the rest had to stand in line.  Why such a restriction is not clear.  If you suddenly are responsible for working with the client, do not create such unnecessary algorithms that will complicate his life. <br><br>  Likewise, in the zoo: we bought e-tickets on the way, it allowed us not to stand in a long queue, but when we tried to get through, we attached the phone and made us go to the ticket office and ask to skip the queue for paper tickets.  Although then I still checked the QR code on the ticket with what was on the screen and did not go through the ticket. <br><br>  I can recommend the qiwi application for contactless payment, it‚Äôs on children‚Äôs phones too, it makes it easy to control expenses without spending a dime on it, since the content of virtual cards is free, there are no fees for transfers.  I did not find any minuses.  By the way, unlike payment for travel, you have to unlock the phone, which is sufficient protection against RFID readers. <br><br>  Post decided to write in order to collect more information on how to pay for transport, find out what models it works and discuss the prospects for wireless payments. <br>  There is a lot of information that I would like to share and discuss, I think in the comments it is the place. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/371341/">https://habr.com/ru/post/371341/</a></p>
