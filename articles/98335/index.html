    <h2>  Methods and practices </h2><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.wireframeshowcase.com/">Wireframe showcase</a></strong> <strong><br></strong>  A collection of examples of wireframes.  Although its scale is far from <a href="http://wireframes.tumblr.com/">collection No. 1</a> , each page layout is combined with the final design in it - it helps to better understand the features of the design process. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/05/sketches-and-wireframes-and-prototypes-oh-my-creating-your-own-magical-wizard-experience.php">Sketches and Wireframes and Prototypes!</a></strong>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/05/sketches-and-wireframes-and-prototypes-oh-my-creating-your-own-magical-wizard-experience.php">Oh my!</a></strong>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/05/sketches-and-wireframes-and-prototypes-oh-my-creating-your-own-magical-wizard-experience.php">Creating Your Own Magical Wizard Experience</a></strong> <br>  Traci Lepore describes in detail possible levels of interface development from sketches and wireframes to interactive prototypes and design.  The article shows well how, together with the time spent on thinking through the interface, its reasonableness increases and ‚Äúwhite spots‚Äù decrease.  <a href="http://www.uxbooth.com/blog/concerning-fidelity-and-design/">Tyler Tate</a> recently wrote on the same topic, including a small useful case from the article with examples of finished documents and a schedule for their creation. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/cxpartners/designing-for-delight-giles-colborne"><strong>Designing for Delight (Giles Colborne Presentation)</strong></a> <br>  Giles Colborne from CXPartners describes the process of creating a design that makes the user feel excited.  And this is not about fashionable visual solutions - for this it is more important to anticipate expectations or help in a problem situation. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/08/engage-customers-in-your-business/">How to Engage Customers in Your E-Commerce Website</a></strong> <br>  In his article for Smashing Magazine, Rung Andras talks about user ratings in online stores - how best to collect them, display on the pages of the site and take into account in special offers. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/06/the-question-protocol-how-to-make-sure-every-form-field-is-necessary.php">The Question Protocol - Necessary</a></strong> <br>  Caroline Jarrett, author of Forms that Work: Web Designing Forms for Usability, describes a good way to reduce form fields.  This is a questionnaire for stakeholders of the company owning the site, which allows you to determine who exactly needs the user-provided data and whether it is possible to opt out of their part. <br><br>  <a href="http://uxmag.com/design/the-small-print-writing-ui-instructions"><strong>The Small Print - Writing UI Instructions</strong></a> <a href="http://uxmag.com/design/the-small-print-writing-ui-instructions"><br></a>  Connie Malamed gives some tips on how to write short explanatory texts in interfaces.  First of all it concerns forms and system messages. <br><br>  <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2010/05/10/not-to-prime-is-a-crime/"><strong>Not to Prime, is a Crime!</strong></a> <a href="http://johnnyholland.org/2010/05/10/not-to-prime-is-a-crime/"><br></a>  Symplicit's Jodie Moule talks about the priming user research method.  During it, the participants in the study create collages describing their daily activities, which helps to better understand the context and characteristics of their life and work. <br><br><h3>  Instruments </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.keynotekungfu.com/"><strong>iPad Keynote Wireframe Toolkit - Get your Keynote Kung-Fu on</strong></a> <a href="http://www.keynotekungfu.com/"><br></a>  A set of stencils for designing in Keynote for iPad.  Although this is not exactly the intended use of the tool for creating presentations, and the tablet is not the most productive platform for working on a large number of pages, the final template is very good. <br><br>  <a href="http://www.naviewapp.com/"><strong>Naview - Create easier navigations through prototyping and testing</strong></a> <a href="http://www.naviewapp.com/"><br></a>  A simple online navigation tool.  Well suited for visual presentation of simple 2-3 level menus on simple websites. <br><br>  <a href="http://userexperience.evantageconsulting.com/2010/05/prototype-content-gathering-template/"><strong>A Template for Gathering Plausible Prototype Content</strong></a> <a href="http://userexperience.evantageconsulting.com/2010/05/prototype-content-gathering-template/"><br></a>  A useful template from Evantgage Consulting, which should help in collecting content for wireframes and interactive prototypes.  <a href="">Direct download link</a> (ZIP, 100 KB). <br><br><h3>  Patterns </h3><br>  <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/01/meet-the-team-pages-examples-and-trends/"><strong>‚ÄúMeet the Team‚Äù Pages - Examples and Trends</strong></a> <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/01/meet-the-team-pages-examples-and-trends/"><br></a>  Overview of examples and rules for the construction of pages "Our team" on the websites of companies and organizations.

The article describes the principles of constructing navigation through the archive and gives a pack of interesting examples. <br><br><h2>  Process </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/24/the-ultimate-guide-to-a-b-testing/"><strong>The Ultimate Guide To A / B Testing</strong></a> <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/06/24/the-ultimate-guide-to-a-b-testing/"><strong><br></strong></a>  A good reminder of the A / B testing process from Paras Chopra.  The article briefly talks about how and what to test, what is especially important during the process, what tools are suitable for work. <br><br>  <a href="http://uxleadership.com/"><strong>UX Leadership - Designing Leadership in the UX Community</strong></a> <a href="http://uxleadership.com/"><strong><br></strong></a>  Dan Szuc and Will Evans have launched a website dedicated to the management and strategy of the design process.

Although it is devoted rather to visual design, it has a good description of the design process. <br><br><h2>  Cases </h2><br>  <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp%3F1128"><strong>Case Study - Gradual Engagement Boosts Twitter Sign-Ups by 29%</strong></a> <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp%3F1128"><strong><br></strong></a>  An excellent case about the recent redesign of the Twitter sign-up process, which made it possible to significantly increase the number of users creating an account.  Its key feature is that the user is actively involved in the life of the service already in the first steps and can immediately ‚Äútouch‚Äù it.  A little more <a href="http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp%3F1130">on the smooth involvement of Luke Wroblewski</a> and <a href="http://www.uie.com/brainsparks/2010/06/24/web-app-masters-a-simple-ladder-of-engagement/">other Twitter statistics</a> . <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.mcq.com/article-persona">Using Persona Advocates to develop user-centric intranets and portals</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.mcq.com/article-persona"><br></a></strong>  Law firm Howard McQueen talks about how the methods used by characters in the process of working on their intranet site - from preliminary research to the use of constructed portraits in the design and development. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/06/personas-as-user-assistance-and-navigation-aids.php">Personas as User Assistance and Navigation Aids</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2010/06/personas-as-user-assistance-and-navigation-aids.php"><br></a></strong>  Another interesting example of using characters from Mike Hughes.  He describes how this technique helped the working group of one of the technical standards to create an easy-to-use body of knowledge. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/mobile/ipad/">Usability of iPad Apps and Websites - First Research Findings</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/mobile/ipad/"><br></a></strong>  The company Jacob Nielsen and Donald Norman conducted a large-scale usability-study of the iPad interface and applications for it.  An interesting point stands out among the general criticism of inconsistency of solutions: the tablet interface is at about the same stage as the web at the beginning of its development, when there were no clear-cut standards yet and everyone was inventing their own solutions to typical problems.  <a href="http://www.nngroup.com/reports/mobile/ipad/ipad-usability.pdf">Direct download link</a> - (PDF, 10 MB) and <a href="http://www.useit.com/alertbox/ipad.html">report summary</a> . <br><br>  Oliver Reichenstein from Information Architects spoke on the same topic.  He <a href="http://informationarchitects.jp/wired-on-ipad-just-like-a-paper-tiger/">criticizes the iPad version of Wired magazine for</a> failing to feed content. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://perceptionnyc.com/node/68">Iron Man 2 Case Study</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://perceptionnyc.com/node/68"><br></a></strong>  The company Perception NYC talks about how pseudo-real interfaces were made for the film Iron Man 2 - from inventing general concepts to preparing prototypes. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/04/google_lays_out.html">Google Lays Out</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2007/04/google_lays_out.html"><br></a></strong>  This article describes in detail Google‚Äôs UX-strategy for mobile devices.  These are 6 key aspects - understanding the needs of users "here and now", accessibility in a pocket, more personal than a computer, transparency of operating modes, special attention to localization and integrated ecosystems. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.lostgarden.com/2010/05/wordcamp-2010-why-we-turned-microsoft.html">Why we turned Microsoft Office into a Game (Ribbon Hero story)</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.lostgarden.com/2010/05/wordcamp-2010-why-we-turned-microsoft.html"><br></a></strong>  Game Specialist Danc has published his presentation from the Wordcamp 2010 conference about working on Ribbon Hero, an educational game for MS Office.

For each of the myths are examples, facts and useful links.  Thomas Vander Wal spoke on the same topic, speaking of the <a href="http://www.personalinfocloud.com/2010/06/5-enterprise-20-myth-mantras-that-must-die.html">5 myths of the internal social services of companies</a> . <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/about-design/Types-of-design/Service-design/">A User's Guide to Service Design</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.designcouncil.org.uk/about-design/Types-of-design/Service-design/"><br></a></strong>  A good overview guide to service design from the Design Council.

She talks about the natural limitations, errors, memory, attention and other behavioral features.  Also interesting are excerpts from her " <a href="http://friendfeed.com/uxroom/b364ac84/100-things-you-should-know-about-people-18-what">100 facts about people</a> ." <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.touchthinking.com/">Iup gesture research</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.touchthinking.com/"><br></a></strong>  The organization The International Usability Partners conducted a large-scale study of users around the world in order to study the habits and expectations of sensory and gestural interfaces.

He lists 11 key aspects that should be taken into account in such a specification - from the motives for working with such a service to the interactions of community members. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://understandinggraphics.com/design/5-myths-of-visual-communication/">5 Myths of Visual Communication</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://understandinggraphics.com/design/5-myths-of-visual-communication/"><br></a></strong>  Although most of the articles in the spirit of "No. of rules of a successful ..." give minimal information to those who are familiar with the material, Connie Malamed talks about things that contrast with many of the interface trends - the use of large fonts, large images, realism and animation. <br><br>  <strong><a href="http://www.henkwijnholds.com/persuasion-tactics-101/psychology/">Persuasion Tactics 101</a></strong> <strong><a href="http://www.henkwijnholds.com/persuasion-tactics-101/psychology/"><br></a></strong>  Henk Wijnholds describes his presentation on how to influence user behavior.
