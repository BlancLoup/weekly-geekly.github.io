The main event of this month was naturally Hackfest. <br><br><h3>  Day minus the first (August 5) </h3><br>  Alexey arrived long before the beginning of Hackfest and, in order not to waste time in vain, Kolin showed the city of Aachen in all its glory on a hot summer day: the cathedral, mineral springs, restaurants, cafes and, of course, the buildings of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A0%25D0%25B5%25D0%25B9%25D0%25BD%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE-%25D0%2592%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D1%2584%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2585%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9_%25D1%2583%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580%25D1%2581%25D0%25B8%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D1%2582_%25D0%2590%25D1%2585%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0">Rhine-Westphalian Technical University</a> (RHTU) scattered around the whole city. <br>  The most important of them for us was not a university clinic building at all (in which all engineering communications were made <a href="">outside the building</a> ), but a temporary building for holding seminars in which a large room was allocated for holding our Hakfest.  Inside this building turned out to be very clean and equipped with modern equipment.  But it is actually temporary: it will be demolished as soon as the permanent building is completed.  So, use the <s>khakis</s> crutches and props is not alien to the Germans :) <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/rosfond/album/480797/view/1069132"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/a41/3a5/020/a413a502001613d1003c10a3b22bc475.jpg" width="800" height="533"></a> <a name="habracut"></a>

      Colin took over most of the organizational issues, and by the arrival of the developers everything was ready for Hackfest. <br><br><h3>  Day 0 (August 6) </h3><br>  Amine, Stefan and Victor landed safely at the airport of Cologne, where they were met by Alex and Kolin. <br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/rosfond/album/480797/view/1069134"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/3b4/ff4/c9b/3b4ff4c9b49f6a2eb6faa6b1684f3a19.jpg" width="800" height="533"></a> <br><br>  Colin invited everyone to his apartment in a student hostel, where he showed and told interesting things.  A small report by Alexey: <br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=ru&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmhML6TqEiY%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;xid=17259,15700019,15700186,15700190,15700248,15700253&amp;usg=ALkJrhibW8vKTutk0qa_ZfnJb9KQByYrAg" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><br><br>  Part of the developers settled into the hostel, and in the evening went to meet Thomas and Timo <br><br><h3>  Day One (August 7) </h3><br>  Hackfest started!  All brought different equipment: laptops, keyboards, mice, monitors, motherboards, memory modules, cables, switches, etc. <br>  Tables inside the premises were arranged in the form of several islands and began what is called <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A5%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B5%25D1%2580">hacking</a> . <br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/rosfond/album/480797/view/1069135"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/108/c3f/676/108c3f6762048386413d2b59553bd0f3.jpg" width="800" height="533"></a> <br><br>  Christoph assembled a minimalist computer directly on the desk from the old hardware for testing ReactOS on real hardware, but it is obvious that the use of virtualization still prevailed. <br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/rosfond/album/480797/view/1069139"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/674/7fd/8ca/6747fd8ca409312912b729830f70708d.jpg" width="800" height="533"></a> <br><br>  Interesting commits made by developers at hackfest on this day: <br><ul><li>  Improvements to the memory manager that Thomas Faber made and a temporary fix for the winogon (more details - <a href="https://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-9598">CORE-9598</a> ) </li><li>  Christoph von Wittich fixed a bug in gdi32 apitest, which consisted of finding data for tests in the wrong way </li></ul><br><br><h3>  Day Two (August 8) </h3><br>  Thomas Faber continued to work on fixing bugs in various parts of ReactOS. <br>  Christoph von Wittich found a problem in the setupapi dynamic library and fixed this error. <br>  Daniel Reimer arrived <s>and brought with him a beer</s> (no, he sent several boxes of real Bavarian beer by mail) and started a whole series of commits: he processed as many as 8 patches (revisions from <a href="https://code.reactos.org/changelog/reactos%3Fcs%3D68625">68625</a> to <a href="https://code.reactos.org/changelog/reactos%3Fcs%3D68640">68640</a> ) from <a href="https://jira.reactos.org/">our JIRA</a> . <br>  We decided to celebrate the successful end of this day in an excellent Italian restaurant. <br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/rosfond/album/480797/view/1069137"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/b9b/df9/c1a/b9bdf9c1af836e451b3730e588291745.jpg" width="800" height="533"></a> <br><br><h3>  Day Three (August 9) </h3><br>  The work went as well as yesterday.  Although some developers did not commit anything, it was clear that they tried their best, and we will soon see the fruits of their work. <br>  By commits, the situation is as follows <br><ul><li>  Daniel Reimer continued his stellar series of commits - nine per day (revisions <a href="https://code.reactos.org/changelog/reactos%3Fcs%3D68625">68641</a> to <a href="https://code.reactos.org/changelog/reactos%3Fcs%3D68640">68650</a> ) </li><li>  Alexey Bragin singled out good and safe changes from his ‚Äúfamous‚Äù LDR patch and <a href="https://code.reactos.org/changelog/reactos%3Fcs%3D68654">committed</a> them.  The remaining changes require more detailed study, since  even though they fix a whole bunch of problems, they are unstable and sometimes cause a deadlock.  The patch is still in development. </li><li>  Christoph von Wittich and Amine Khaldi worked on the <a href="https://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-9992">CORE-9992</a> fix and other useful work on the fusion dynamic library. </li><li>  Eric Kohl added a partition warning to an attempt to delete the active partition ( <a href="https://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-9996">CORE-9996</a> ) to the installer code responsible for partitioning </li></ul><br><br>  Some of the developers secretly in the trunk brought a pony named Alcopony, and she made sure that everyone worked until the very end of Hakfest! <br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/rosfond/album/480797/view/1069138"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/195/a47/f55/195a47f55e48eb222bea858bf0d300b9.jpg" width="800" height="533"></a> <br><br><h3>  Fourth day (August 10) </h3><br>  Daniel Reimer continues: this time closed a dozen bugs (revisions from <a href="https://code.reactos.org/changelog/reactos%3Fcs%3D68625">68655</a> to <a href="https://code.reactos.org/changelog/reactos%3Fcs%3D68640">68658</a> and from <a href="https://code.reactos.org/changelog/reactos%3Fcs%3D68625">68662</a> to <a href="https://code.reactos.org/changelog/reactos%3Fcs%3D68640">68672</a> ). <br>  Christoph von Wittich further understood the installation and operation of ATI Radeon graphics card drivers in ReactOS.  To do this, a bug was created with a great number <a href="https://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-10000">CORE-10000</a> .  Setupapi lacked support for processing (unpacking) LZ archives (because Wine was unnecessary) and Christoph successfully implemented it.  Now the ATI Radeon driver installer works fine in ReactOS. <br>  Also, as a bonus, Thomas Faber fixed the release of an uninitialized pointer in the setupapi dynamic library code ( <a href="https://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-10004">CORE-10004</a> ). <br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/rosfond/album/480797/view/1069139"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/674/7fd/8ca/6747fd8ca409312912b729830f70708d.jpg" width="800" height="533"></a> <br><br><h3>  Day Five (August 11) </h3><br>  On this day, Aleksey Bragin and Thomas Faber had to leave, and continue working in the usual mode remotely.  Thomas made the corrected memory manager, API tests, etc. <br>  Daniel Reimer closed 4 bugs, and <a href="https://code.reactos.org/user/gyros">Benedict Freisen</a> joined the commits.  Benedict was just given direct access to writing to the main source branch, and he took great advantage of this in order to directly commit all his work on hhpcomp, ‚Äúto our new HTML Help Project compiler (* .hhp).‚Äù <br>  Timo Kreuzer committed the implementation of the EngQueryLocalTime function, which many video card drivers probably need. <br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/rosfond/album/480797/view/1069140"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/eb4/eca/89b/eb4eca89b8cc5f152070f5bf93d9c805.jpg" width="800" height="533"></a> <br><br><h3>  Day of the sixth and seventh (August 12 and 13) </h3><br>  Timo Kreuzer eliminated the error in win32k, as a result of which the subsystem accessed the wrong user mode address because it did not check in the context of which process it was running ( <a href="https://jira.reactos.org/browse/CORE-10017">CORE-10017</a> ), and that‚Äôs all. <br>  In total, <a href="https://jira.reactos.org/issues/%3Ffilter%3D13311">51 bug</a> reports were closed during the hackfest. <br>  Hackfest has already moved to the team building stage called Beerfest and Vodkafest <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/9be/516/9d6/9be5169d633180ea6c88b08b55f25dce.jpg" alt="Image" width="100" height="133"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/db2/bcc/9d6/db2bcc9d64dc9a28720861b3acc461b2.jpg" alt="Image" width="100" height="133"><br>  And it's time to get on the cars, planes, trains and go home. <br><br>  Throughout the week, Victor Martinez did a live broadcast via YouTube telling about what was done at Hackfest.  Their recordings are available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMo8NP-2oP35rauon-Duc9Q">our channel ReactOS Community</a> .  These broadcasts more fully describe what was happening, and generally convey the atmosphere that reigned at Hakfest! <br><br> <a href="https://fotki.yandex.ru/next/users/rosfond/album/480797/view/1069141"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/35e/bd5/447/35ebd5447d15f03feec28d3673674a9f.jpg" width="800" height="533"></a> <br><br>  It is important to mention that another spin-off of the hackfest was the emergence of <a href="https://www.reactos.org/wiki/Using_shared_folders">basic support for</a> UNC paths and shared network folders in ReactOS.  Now you can use shared folders and mount them as disks in Vbox and VMware. <br><br>  Well, for a snack, we invite you to familiarize yourself with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php%3Ffbid%3D10153071999457011%26set%3Da.10150186234337011.306302.579902010%26type%3D1%26theater">our experience of</a> ‚Äúparticipation‚Äù in the GenerationS accelerator conducted by RVC.
