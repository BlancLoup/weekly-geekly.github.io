This is the site of the Independent Association of Buyers (NAP RF).  What can I say.  Normal, such a site.  Well consumers and consumed.  But I could not miss the article <a href="http://expertiza.ru/expertiza.phtml%3Fid%3D680">““ Team “G” on the threshold! ”</a>  Seeing next to links to other parts of this saga-with-interesting-title.

    <a name="habracut"></a><br><br>  The articles are very interesting, contradicting with themselves, repeating the same thing.  Well, in general, the author tries to show himself clever in the area about which he knows nothing.  A lot of loud words are used to intimidate some “newbies on the runet forums”.  I will not comment on the replicas. <br><br><h1>  Excerpts from the first part ↓ </h1><br><blockquote>  Round-the-clock presence on the forums.  Anyone of the same type of representatives of the “G team” is online all the time, always ready to reflect any “attack” of a dissident liberal.  During the day there is no hour when it would be possible to lead discussions on the forum without these “curators”.  Regardless of the topic, any character from the “G team” who will actually be on duty at all significant forums day and night, intermittently joining your discussion, periodically wandering from forum to forum with similar materials and remarks. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Unlimited devotion to the Head of State and his entourage.  Members of the “G team” with “promoted”, known in many forums “nicknames”, invariably express their immense love for the President.  They are ready to “physically destroy” anyone physically who expresses even the slightest doubt about his merits.  For the slightest criticism, they threaten opponents: with the courts, with beatings, with reprisals and with the killing of both the opponents themselves and their relatives. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Sometimes ideological practices of past years are used, for example, Yakovlev's book “The CIA against the USSR” is used by the “G team”.  In addition, they widely use odious materials: “Protocols of the Elders of Zion” or “Mein Kampf”.  The citation of the "Short Course of the CPSU (B)" (published during the life of "Comrade Stalin") is constantly (but without mentioning the source) </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  A special subject of hatred is the Russian liberal intelligentsia, former dissidents, independent journalists and the human rights movement, as well as some particularly hated individuals: S.A.  Kovalev, E. Bonner, A. Babitsky, A. Politkovskaya, G. Pasko, V. Shenderovich, V. Novodvorskaya and other people known for their critical attitude to the current government. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  As soon as a dissident liberal gets to the forum, with a clear position of an “ideological opponent”, he is immediately taken into circulation and they hold a collective “active event” with the whole “G” team. </blockquote>  <sup>... and a spade handle.</sup>  <sup><s>sorry could not resist.</s></sup> <br><br><br><br><br><h1>  ... a little bit from the second part ↓ </h1><br><blockquote>  And here is another very typical statement by a member of the “G team”: “You, fucked up, are you out, do you end up at the monitor, or something?  Another way you can not?  There is no man?  Although who you fucking need.  So you hang around here from morning till night.  Any communication for you.  You pour out your poison (or rather dissatisfaction).  Take yourself a man and have sex properly, you see the mind will increase, although the latter is questionable. "  And so on, and so on, without interruption, dozens and hundreds of similar texts under different "nicknames".  Most of the real women participating in the discussions are not able to withstand such a collective onslaught of the “G team” for a long time and leave the forums. </blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><h1>  ... and from the third ↓ </h1><br><blockquote>  To the question why they so often and shamelessly repeat the already refuted lie, the members of the “G” team honestly answer, we quote: “Sort inscriptions read far more people than they write.  And the fact that I am writing the same thing, so if someone constantly says that he is a pig, then sooner or later the subject grunts. ” </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  ... received immediately after their speeches on the forums against the ideological values ​​of the ruling regime, the most powerful virus attacks that virtually destroyed computer software and blocked their access to the Internet ... </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  For example, one of the forum visitors <a href="http://www.xn--ivitas-hrf.ru/">www.sivitas.ru reports</a> : “Immediately after my brief participation in the ivitas.ru forum on the need for FSB lustration, a number of strong virus attacks broke through all the protection systems of my computer and completely blocked my Internet access for a few days.  Assuming that it was an accident, I returned to the discussion in this forum, on an unpleasant FSB topic.  On the same day, a message appeared in the forum: “ <sup><i>everything was very rude.</i></sup> ” Immediately after this message, a powerful virus attack on the computer repeated.  Apparently, this was the continuation of the work of the “Major of the FSB”. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  One of the most interesting features of the “G team” is their ability to find out and publish in the forums not only the places of residence of their anonymous opponents, but also their names, surnames, details of their biographies, place of work, names of their relatives. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  ... read her articles and write the same reviews on them, not sparing the time and money to pay for the expensive Internet in Russia? </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  After the “disgraced” reader left the MN forums censored by the “G” team, he was followed by the IP addresses found by his Internet service providers located in the United States and a transparent hint at the possibility of reaching his managers and “tapping out” »About his stay on the forums during business hours. </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Impressions of a newcomer on the Runet forum “When I first visited one of the forums of the Moscow News newspaper, I saw there a“ discussion ”consisting of dialogues of a female“ nick ”with a close-knit group of comrades who dirtyly insulted this woman.  The lady wrote correct and reasoned texts about the totalitarian nature of Islam and the historical connection of the KGB with the Middle Eastern Arab dictatorships.  In response, she received only obscene language and obscenity from several male characters praising the KGB.  I was indignant at the ugly picture of harassment and gave a remark about the inadmissibility of such methods of discussion and insults the girl.  After that, letters came to my e-mail from two forum participants: a certain pianist from New York and a lady of good age from Florida.  In them, uninvited correspondents reported that the woman for whom I stood up was a supposedly malicious provocateur, who targeted persecution of honest, decent people.  I was offered a picture of events, exactly the opposite of the one I saw with my own eyes.  An elderly lady attached her photo and invited me to visit.  The musician offered to meet in one of the Russian restaurants in the city of New York.  As it turned out later, these two characters are one of the key ones on the MN forums and on some other liberal forums.  They always act in tandem, are online for many hours every day (of course, under different "nicknames").  If at first I had doubts about the existence of the “G team”, then the members of the “G team” themselves scattered him very quickly.  I was particularly impressed by the active participation of the newspaper’s editorial staff in expelling dissenters from the site - for the sake of those who systematically bullied and insulted others. ” </blockquote><br><br><br><br><br><h1>  ... well, from a couple of the article "" Team "G" strikes back!  ↓ </h1><br><blockquote><img src="http://expertiza.ru/images/gebnya.jpg" width="85" height="85" align="left">  Placement of materials under the general title “Team“ G ”on our resource caused an immediate and effective response.  To begin with, the editorial computer was twice attacked by viruses: for several days our virus workers successfully fought Trojans, hooked up by e-mail.  And when the virus attack was over, the editors received an angry letter from the author, hiding under the pseudonym "Katerina Emeline." </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  Your groans about “lamers” are ridiculous - you are developing sites for clients, often incompetent in your “craft,” but highly competent in their business.  They pay you money - how can you treat your customers that way - take their reward and scold them for their eyes?  Is it ethical ??? </blockquote><br><br><blockquote>  You did not even bother to read carefully the name of our "organization" - this name is on the main page of our site.  But carefully read your letter to the end, everyone can easily call your organization - <h4>  ChK-NKVD-MGB-KGB-FSB !!! </h4></blockquote><br><br><br><br><br>  Well, the last part <a href="http://expertiza.ru/expertiza.phtml%3Fid%3D680">"" Team "G" on the threshold!</a>  <a href="http://expertiza.ru/expertiza.phtml%3Fid%3D680">"</a> , This is a straightforward instruction for novice terrorists: <br><blockquote>  They got inside!  Either you were lucky, and you managed to destroy everything or a part of everything, or you should blame yourself. </blockquote><br><blockquote>  The first is that they will ask: “Do you have weapons or narcotic substances in the house?” If you do not have either one or the other, you can breathe a sigh of relief.  If there is - you are not lucky on a large scale! </blockquote></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/37507/">https://habr.com/ru/post/37507/</a></p>
