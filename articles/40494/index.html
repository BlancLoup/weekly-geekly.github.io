  <section class="page js-page"><h1>‚ÄúChorny Fluorneg‚Äù and the future of ‚Äústable work in a large corporation‚Äù</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  So, the global financial crisis widely advertised by many has begun.  So what? <br><br>  Most of all in the breeding prophecies about the so-called Great Global Depression, I am surprised by two things.  The first is an attempt to link it with the peak of oil production and other phenomena of a physical nature.  In fact, the first Great Depression and other financial crises did not arise at all due to the fact that someone did not have enough oil or coal, but because one day there were not enough solvent suckers who would buy the right amount of assets. at inflated at the regular and last time prices.  Something like MMM, with only partial reference to reality. <br><br>  The second is the attempt to once again declare the "death of capitalism."  Say, the biggest pyramid is capitalism as such, and therefore it is supposed to die, and in general capitalism is an evil type, it contradicts human nature, etc. I would like to ask these ‚Äúnastradamus‚Äù (which I have identified myself as Davydov): 
      <br>
        <script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
        <ins class="adsbygoogle"
          style="display:block; text-align:center;"
          data-ad-layout="in-article"
          data-ad-format="fluid"
          data-ad-client="ca-pub-6974184241884155"

      <br>
      <em>and what, in fact, are there alternatives to the capitalist method of farming at this stage?</em> <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Davydov and others like him talk about some kind of ‚Äúnon-profitable‚Äù economy (something like Open Source in the material sphere), about ‚Äúvolunteering‚Äù, ‚Äúenthusiasm‚Äù, ‚Äúself-sacrifice‚Äù and other beautiful things.  It is wonderful that there are people who are ready to selflessly raise our planet from shit.  But can one seriously expect that all one day will become so white and fluffy, and remove all protection from the ‚Äúblack and prickly‚Äù?  Moreover, can it be expected that the ‚Äúgood‚Äù will remain so in the context of weakening feedback from their efforts, in a crowd of ‚Äúbad‚Äù?  A system devoid of material feedback resolves the prisoner's ‚Äúdilemma‚Äù in favor of the most unprincipled of its members.  In other words, there is no better incentive or punishment than a dollar. <br><br>  The reality is that money, the market is an imperfect mechanism for solving material problems, teeming with bugs, but they have not yet invented anything more efficiently.  One of the types of such bugs are periodically occurring large and small financial crises.  Sooner or later, the current bug will be professional, the mechanism is patched (in 1933, the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãthe patch itself, that is, targeted regulation of the economy) was new and will work again until another bug emerges.  What is deadly for the whole system is not clear. <br><br>  Thus, the current ‚ÄúCrisis‚Äù cannot be called a ‚Äúcrisis of world capitalism‚Äù.  Capitalism has not nearly revealed its potential (if it is possible at all to speak about its full disclosure) as long as there is at least one corporation in the modern sense of the word.  But it seems that this corporate white-collar world is coming to an end.  More precisely, a substantial restructuring.  But for a single white collar, this is like the end of the world. <br><br>  The bank, which was covered with a silicone basin and caused all this hype - Lehman Brothers - had a 158-year history.  This is exactly two times more than the period since the beginning of the Great Depression.  In 1850, legal slavery existed in the United States, and serfdom existed in the Russian Empire, and Marx had not yet begun to write his Capital.  The financial dinosaur that miraculously survived the biggest global crisis of the past, this time threw back its claws.  Should I feel sorry for him in an era when businesses (and banks!) Open and close in a few years, fulfilling their mission, and the concept of "stability" goes down in history?  It is possible to regret only those who seriously believed in the corporate myth. <br><br>  Before shedding tears over the future of hundreds of thousands of Lehman Brothers clerks and other bankruptcy candidates who will be dismissed today or tomorrow, I want to ask the question: are we ready for this turn of events? <br><br>  Are we ready for the fact that the so-called holivar alternative of ‚ÄúDO IT YOURSELF or DO YOUR JOB‚Äù is replaced by another one - ‚ÄúDO or DIE‚Äù? <br><br>  Are we ready to acknowledge the fact that <strong>there are no more stable WORKS than net</strong> (yes, there is no work, there is no stability at all, except in a coffin, but we don‚Äôt need to go there :)) and stop driving corporate myths into our heads and the heads of our children? <br><br>  This is important only for us.  <strong>CRISIS OF WORLD CORPORATE</strong> do not care if we are ready for it. <br><br>  And there will be even more capitalism, money, globalization and even corporations in the post-crisis world.  The corporate party problem is not in corporations, but in the relationships that prevail in and between them.  These relations will be radically revised on the orders of General Dollar.  The end result of the global crisis will be a certain ‚Äúnew course 2.0‚Äù, a set of recommendations for the improvement of economic structures in the new conditions (with respect to financial, tax legislation, etc., but not with respect to basic market principles).  Even the notorious chimera of ‚Äúintellectual property‚Äù, patents and copyright, which have great chances not to survive until the middle of the century, has a very mediocre relation to the subject.  Perhaps there will be some new currencies or international financial institutions (which initiate this course), and some of the existing ones will become obsolete.  In any case, this in no way pulls not a revolution, but rather a planned upgrade of the world economic system, its adaptation to a much more globalized and saturated market.  The potential for extensive growth (the search for even larger volumes of cheap labor, consumers of loans, etc., that is, the downward cycle according to Kondratiev) has been exhausted ‚Äî intensification begins, technology moves and, in general, qualitative solutions instead of quantitative ones.  All this requires much more effort, but over time will inevitably bring real results.  And the coming hard world of the 2010s, at least, is looking somewhere ahead. <br><br>  Forward. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/40494/">https://habr.com/ru/post/40494/</a></p>
