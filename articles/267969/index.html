      Under the cut: <br>  * The most powerful virtual machines with GPUs in the public cloud <br>  * Reserved Instances <br>  * Platform for IoT solutions <br>  * Cortana Analytics Suite <br><br>  And much more.  And, as usual, a lot about Open Source. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Let's start with the fact that, perhaps, long ago, users requested virtual machines with full-fledged GPUs.  GPU, as is known, is used for heavy computing, incl.  modeling, etc. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/ff5/a25/337/ff5a253370f34c61d4cacf593ab4eb8f.png"><br><br>  A new series of virtual machines in Azure under the letter N will soon become available to the general public. Inside these machines will be what is called the <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-servers.html">latest NVidia generation Tesla GPU, K80</a> , and the recently announced NVidia <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/object/nvidia-grid-buy.html">M60</a> .  With NVIDIA GRID technology, you can deploy an application that actively uses graphics components, such as Autodesk, Esri, and others, in the cloud and work successfully with them.  NVIDIA GRID 2.0, which supports the NVIDIA Quadro GPU, is twice the performance of its predecessor, and has support for Linux. <br><br>  Besides the fact that onboard these VMs there will be powerful GPUs, several similar machines can be merged into a farm using super-fast <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_direct_memory_access">RDMA</a> . <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/c45/2bd/98e/c452bd98e5020eb305e5e8a0be3ea5f9.jpg"><br><br>  <i>‚ÄúAccelerate your device, regardless of location.</i>  <i>We‚Äôre excited about how you‚Äôre looking for anywhere. ‚Äù</i> <br>  Jen-Hsun Huang, CEO, NVIDIA. <br><br>  <i>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a real challenge for the N-Series compute family, to our customers. ‚Äù</i> <br>  Jason Zander, corporate vice president Microsoft Azure. <br><br>  VM N series will be available in the next few months. <br>  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/videos/azurecon-2015-applications-that-scale-using-gpu-compute/">Read more</a> <br><br>  <b>Microsoft Azure Securi</b> <b>ty Center</b> . <br>  The Azure Security Center is a service that helps you detect and prevent security threats, and increase visibility and control over what happens to the security of your projects in Azure, including Advanced Threats, using Microsoft machine learning and experience.  At the same time, it is not just a dashboard or portal, it is rather a living and constantly-evolving mechanism that allows you to react proactively and not only to threats, including various security tools (firewalls, antiviruses, etc.). <br><br>  <b>Azure Backup</b> <b>for GA Application</b> <br>  Backup was before, but now it is able to work at a more detailed level, helping you to reserve specific loads for you - for example, SQL, Hyper-V VM, SharePoint and Exchange. <br><br>  <b>Azure File Storage GA</b> <br>  Azure File is a service that allows you to connect Azure Storage using SMB 3.0.  This makes the connection permanent and secure.  Azure Files also has a RESTful API for performing management tasks. <br>  Why: transfer file "ball" to the cloud, "sharing" data from the server, High Availability "ball", work from a local server with a cloud "ball". <br>  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/">More details</a> . <br><br>  <b>Cortana Analytics Suite</b> <b>- already available</b> <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/advanced-analytics/default.aspx"><b>Cortana Analytics Suite</b></a> <b>is an</b> umbrella term that combines several tools and services for building analytical solutions - information management, storage, analytics, visualization, and personal assistant Cortana.  All of this can be integrated with each other in order to provide users with a personalized experience of communicating with big data. <br><br>  <b>Azure IoT Suite</b> <br>  <b>Azure IoT Suite</b> - an umbrella term that combines several tools and services designed to build IoT solutions - data collection from end devices (sensors, etc., Event Hubs and Stream Analytics), their storage (Azure Storage / ...), analytics , machine learning, visualization (PowerBI) and reaction to events with sending commands back to the end devices.  There are more than 10 services in total, and you can already do remote monitoring, later predictive analytics (Azure Machine Learning) and management will be available. <br><br>  In addition, if you are creating a solution, then you can use additional bonuses from interacting with Microsoft by certifying your solution in the <a href="http://www.azure.com/certifiedforiot">Microsoft Azure Certified for IoT</a> program - with further help in getting more from your solution. <br>  <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/internet-of-things/overview.aspx">Read more</a> <br><br>  <b>Azure IoT Hub</b> <br>  A service designed to securely connect, deploy, update and manage end devices, capable of handling millions of different devices on different operating systems and protocols.  It can be used both separately and as part of a project using the Azure IoT Suite. <br>  Why: simplify the construction of IoT solutions;  connection of devices and sensors;  organization of sensor communication with the backend;  safety regulation <br>  <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/iot-hub/">Azure IoT Hub</a> <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/e21/b0b/672/e21b0b6728e736d28730c619000d5186.png"><br><br>  <b>Azure Container Service</b> <br>  As you know, we love Linux, Docker and many other useful projects.  Azure Container Service is a service that combines Apache Mesos, Docker, Mesosphere Datacenter Operating System (DCOS) and the power of Azure to manage containers, both locally and in the cloud.  Using this service, you can deploy a Mesos cluster to manage docked applications using Microsoft Azure Resource Manager.  Will be available closer to the end of the year. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/getpro/habr/post_images/937/60f/bb5/93760fbb5ec61cf99e44980ab9eace42.png"><br><br>  <b>Azure Reserved Compute</b> <br>  Azure Reserved Compute is a special resource payment model in which you (from December) can pay 63% of the basic cost of a computing unit-virtual machine in Azure for 12 months at a discount of 63 months.  This option is available only for those users who have entered into the Enterprise Agreement. <br><br>  <b>New</b> <b>DV2</b> <b>Virtual Machines</b> <br>  DV2, a new VM series, comes out with 2.4 GHz Intel Xeon E5 v3 (Haswell) on board, and with the help of Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 you can make 3.2 GHz out of it, which makes DV2 35% faster than the current VM D- series (since DV2 are based on D). <br>  Why: for applications that require faster CPU, disk performance and more memory. <br><br>  <b>App Service Environment</b> <br>  App Service Environment released in GA with full SLA.  ASE is a completely isolated and dedicated for you environment in which you can safely deploy and develop applications using scaling and various types of services - Web Apps, Mobile Apps, API Apps and Logic Apps. <br>  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/building-the-intelligent-cloud-announcing-new-azure-innovations-to-transform-business/">Read more</a> <br><br>  <b>Partnership with</b> <b>Akamai</b> <br>  At AzureCon, a strategic partnership with Akamai was announced to integrate Akamai‚Äôs most powerful capabilities into Azure, which should seriously increase the capabilities of the Azure cloud platform - coverage and scaling. <br><br>  <b>Azure Mobile Engagement GA</b> <br>  Azure Mobile Engagement, formerly known as a Cappptain product, has been released to GA.  This is a convenient service that provides a dashboard for managing analytics and user interaction on various platforms on which the Mobile Engagement integrated library application is installed.  Works for iOS, Android, Windows 8.x, Windows Phone 8.x, Cordova. <br><br>  Why: responding to analytics - collecting and processing data about the user, device, software, etc., and responding to it using data on user behavior and demographic characteristics;  monitoring what is happening with the application - exceptions, sessions, etc .;  sending Push and polls to an audience selected by special criteria;  organization of advertising campaigns;  maintenance of users;  tracking user retention. <br>  <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/mobile-engagement">Read more</a> <br><br>  <b>Live Encoding</b> <b>for</b> <b>Azure Media Services</b> <br>  Media Services is a service for managing and distributing multimedia content with relevant functionality.
