  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Management 2.0 (Part 2)</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  A week has passed since my <a href="http://habrahabr.ru/blogs/i_am_clever/42028/">last post</a> about the idea of ‚Äã‚Äãintroducing a karma system as an intangible motivator of IT sales managers.  As promised I publish the results and answer the questions asked in the comments. <br><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  All questions asked in the comments can be divided into several categories.  For these categories and build a report. <br><ul><li>  Employees will shit in karma, cheating karma. <br>  This did not happen.  Nobody turned karma to anyone, did not put minuses, and in general, the decomposition of the collective, about which some wrote, did not happen.  In the same way, no one began to wind karma around, etc.  Just no one saw this necessary. <br></li><li>  Laziness <br>  Overwhelmingly, points were awarded by the head and his deputy.  With rare exceptions, the staff did not put each other.  Whether this is connected with the reluctance to bring a colleague (and in this context, an opponent) up or down, or simply with the inability to objectively assess the equal, I find it difficult to say, although I am more inclined to the second option. <br></li><li>  Quarrels in a team <br>  For the reason described above, no quarrels occurred.  From noticeable changes in interaction ... One employee with a slightly lower work efficiency was organized and independently helped to deal with some difficult moments for him.  I did not specifically touch this process and only watched from the side.  They did this not because of the desire to raise their karma, but in order to pull out the lagging <br></li></ul><br><br>  The conclusions from this week regarding the system can be made as follows. <br>  The system works as an additional push when it is necessary to fix the fulfillment of short-term goals and objectives.  Employees prefer not to evaluate the work of peers, but pay attention to the level of karma to each other and try to support the latter in the list and catch up with the first. <br>  On the weekly flight analysis (just finished), one of the employees clearly saw for himself why he was at the bottom of the list, saw what the others were rewarded for.  The last half hour of it pour very sensible ideas to optimize work.  PROFIT!  :))

      It is possible to make the system better by informing employees in advance what and how much karma they can get or lose, but the categories should be formulated in such a way that the initiative is not suppressed.  De facto, the opportunity to put karma remained with the leadership.  So, perhaps, better.  The fact that one employee has assessed the work of another is also appreciated by the manager. <br><br>  In view of these amendments, I decided to leave the system and continue to observe. <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/42655/">https://habr.com/ru/post/42655/</a></p>
