  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Published ranking of regional Internet projects</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The magazine Business District, with the support of <a href="http://rocit.ru/">ROCIT</a> and the <a href="http://tagline.ru/">Tagline</a> Expert Group, <a href="http://dkvartal.ru/magazines/dk-ekb/2008/n43/top-list_rejjting_regionalnykh_internet-proektov">published</a> Russia's first ranking of the richest regional sites.  According to the rating, the top five Internet projects with the largest turnover outside the two capitals included 3 sites from Ekaterinburg, 1 from Nizhny Novgorod and 1 from Chelyabinsk.  Rabota66.ru portal is in fifth place (turnover for I-III quarters of this year - 12.1 million rubles).  The first one is the site PulsCen.ru, owned by the publishing house ABAK-press, which also publishes the magazine Delovoy Kvartal (the site‚Äôs turnover for the same period is 92 million rubles) <br><img src="http://tigger.pp.ru/images/rating.gif" alt="The first five of the rating of regional Internet projects"><br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  In total, about 150 various projects were analyzed for the rating - urban portals, job-resurs, autosites, websites for parents, etc. - from 7 cities of Russia (Yekaterinburg, Krasnoyarsk, Nizhny Novgorod, Novosibirsk, Rostov-on-Don, Samara and Chelyabinsk).  50 sites with the largest turnover were included in the summary table.  Not participated in the ranking of online stores, corporate sites and sites, "not having a clear geographic location." <br><br>  In the "Business District" they say that for the first rating "they took the most developed millionaire cities".  In the future, its geography will expand. <br><br>  According to Maria Ginzburg, a representative of the magazine ‚ÄúBusiness Quarter‚Äù, in the comments on the page of the Internet version of the rating, his goal is very simple - ‚Äúto show successful regional projects." "... It is interesting to compare how successful the business model of different projects are: how many employees, what investments required to maintain this resource, compare costs with turnover, etc. ", added Maria.

      Among the experts that made up the rating were: Alexander Laryanovsky, Regional Director for Yandex, director of media technologies at Rinet, Sergey Tachkov, Director of Information Group 74, Vladislav Lisitsyn, and many other representatives of regional Internet companies, most of which are represented in the rating.  Their names are in the pdf release rating <a href="">here</a> . <br><br>  As they say in the release, the experts first formed a pool of the most visited and profitable, in their opinion, projects.  After that, their owners were sent a questionnaire in which those were asked to indicate data about their activities.  As can be seen from the final table, far from all decided to disclose the turnover data.  In such cases, the place in the ranking was determined by the estimates of experts. <br><br>  More than half of the turnover of regional portals is formed by display advertising (61%), and only 21% bring in various services, the rating compilers say.  According to their estimates, the capacity of the Internet advertising market in Yekaterinburg in the first 3 quarters of the year was 130-200 million rubles.  Novosibirsk, about 80 million rubles, Chelyabinsk, 40-50 million rubles, Nizhny Novgorod, about 40 million rubles, and Samara, 20 million rubles.  The smallest markets in Krasnoyarsk and Rostov-on-Don - in each city about 13-15 million rubles.  But experts believe that their potential is much greater. <br><br>  As a result, with the exception of the immediately apparent situation, when the rating compilers allocated the places in it among themselves, the picture turned out to be interesting.  Nobody has done such work in the regions yet.  And if the results of the rating are controversial (and they certainly will be so), the appearance of alternative versions of the top can only be welcomed. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/46709/">https://habr.com/ru/post/46709/</a></p>
