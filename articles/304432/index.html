      To say that RAO has worked very strangely lately, to say nothing.  In the format of obscene relationships of the toad and the viper, <a href="https://life.ru/t/%25D1%258E%25D1%2580%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BD%25D1%2582%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2/425407/iurii_antonov_ob_ariestie_ghiendiriektora_rao_fiedotova_parien_ot_dieniegh_potierial_gholovu">let us give the</a> floor to the hero-winner of motorcyclists, Yuri Antonov, but even without these nuances, the history of radioactive waste is beautiful and unpretentious. <br><br>  For those who are suddenly not in the material, in two words: there is an organization Russian Authors Society.  Which state has given the rights with a firm hand to collect money from everyone who intersects with the copyrights of all musicians, poets and other creative people in their activities.  What, periodically, took the form of a slightly comical, bordering with schizophrenia.  A classic story is the <a href="http://www.bbc.com/russian/society/2011/05/110524_kazan_scorpions_rao.shtml">demand for the Scorpions group to</a> pay 5% of the fees in favor of themselves, but to the RAO, although before the same story happened in October 2008 with the English group Deep Purple in Rostov-on-Don.  There, by the way, there was a court that RAO won. <br><br>  Actually now, as all progressive humanity hopes, the issue will be solved, only a little too high Fedotov will be imprisoned, or the country‚Äôs leadership realizes that the uncontrolled collection of money for little-formalized actions of an unspecified circle endured, practically guarantees spontaneous theft in an organization that happily passes through itself all that money.  And changing the conditional Fedotov to no less conditional Antonov will not radically change the situation. <br><br>  At the same time, what is happening globally visualizes everything that happens with this part of copyright in general: virtual fees for rights arising out of the blue, which can not be traced or counted in any way.  There is a conditional cafe in which it plays a radio, which has already paid once for the right to broadcast it, this is what it is broadcasting.  And you can listen to it.  But if in the cafe - then the leadership of the cafe should RAO bubble.  If this is it cut the receiver. <br><br>  At the same time, in theory, the author is certainly good if he gets the money once again.  Stimulates authors.  But just judging by the fact that they have easily set aside half a billion money, which gives a forecast of real embezzlements every 5 times more, this money does not really reach the authors. <br><br>  The trouble is that no one has yet proposed a normal mechanism. <br><br>  I had about two years ago about this one thought, quite a mock character, but radical.  Stupidly impose a tax on the consumption of copyright content.  A couple of thousand rubles a year.  And then this amount is distributed among all authors, who somehow learned during the year.  And there are no pirated films in the country right away.  Because you have already paid for the consumption of any copy.  A Frenchman watches her - he is a pirate, he is right in the face of the damage.  And as our man - right around grace, a license arises right in him.  Lepot and all that. <br><br>  The precedent, by the way, is already there - <a href="http://www.forbes.ru/sobytiya/rynki/231073-kak-sobirayut-i-na-chto-tratyat-nalog-nikity-mihalkova">the Mikhalkov law</a> .  The methodology is similar. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/304432/">https://habr.com/ru/post/304432/</a></p>
