  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Email marketing in an era of 8 seconds of attention</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article"> <a href="https://sendpulse.com/"><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/c2a/319/944/c2a319944e5a4218adf55539a00a91ac.jpg"></a> <br><br>  The attention span of an adult is less than that of a preschooler.  As a rule, adults focus on a task for 8 seconds.  The explanation for this is the effect of various factors that are constantly trying to shift attention to themselves, thereby not giving a person a chance to focus on one thing for a long period of time. <br><br>  Consider some statistics: <br><ul><li>  On average, office workers receive and send 121 emails per day; </li><li>  An adult faces 247 marketing messages per day; </li><li>  28% of the time is spent on social media, where marketing messages are plentiful. </li></ul><br>  And this is just a few statistics showing us the number of processed messages during the working day. <br>  But, despite the fact that users see a huge amount of marketing messages every day, email marketing is now stronger than ever.  The payback ratio of email marketing investments is about $ 38 for every $ 1 spent. <br>  So, how to break through the entire advertising noise of the Internet and capture 8 vital seconds of customer attention?  This is easy to achieve, but you may need to make some changes to your business. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><h1>  Email campaign rules to keep a user‚Äôs attention </h1><br><h4>  Conciseness </h4><br>  A modern person has absolutely no time to read huge letters with a long introduction and the same theses.  The content of your letter should be brief, information should be provided point by point - the ability to quickly run through it with your eyes highlighting for yourself the most important thing from the text.  As for email marketing, less text - better result. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/1a1/39a/1b7/1a139a1b7bdf4411ac6d8aaae82c1ade.jpg">

      Within a minute you can run the gas in the text and learn in brief all the news of the group.  If some event from their life really interests you, you can follow the link and get acquainted with it in more detail. <br><br><h4>  Mobile version - must have any newsletter </h4><br>  Look around and see that half of the people around you are sitting on the Internet from your mobile device.  These gadgets are gaining popularity every day.  40% of users start working on one device, and end on another. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/306/700/699/306700699c564c00b2d63814351803ad.png"><br><br>  In 2010-2015, the number of open emails from mobile devices increased by 30%.  In addition, 67.2% of users view mail from mobile and 42.3% from tablets. <br>  This means that if you do not have an adapted layout, then you lose most of your target audience. <br><br>  Spend a little more time, but make sure that the information is displayed correctly on each smartphone.  The result will be worth your time and effort. <br><br><h4>  The power of visual content </h4><br>  The human brain processes the image in just 13 milliseconds.  In other words, the <b>brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text</b> . <br>  When using powerful visual content, you can ensure that your letters will be viewed by subscribers in seconds. <br>  A prime example of this method is the distribution of the company Pizza Hut.  The recipient for 5 seconds can get acquainted with the company's profitable offer: order 2 big pizzas, a bottle of cola and choose one of three options for snacks with sauce including delivery for only $ 34.95.  All that is required from the client is to press the green button ‚ÄúOrder‚Äù and enter your data for delivery. <br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/e51/e78/f7d/e51e78f7d6374b54b93a902b4e03fef1.jpg"><br><br>  The use of visual content is not only a quick way to read, but also helps in better assimilation of information. <br>  We hope that you are still reading the article, because 8 seconds have already passed.  Summing up, remember that email marketing is an effective way to attract customers, but you need to give them what they want, when it‚Äôs convenient and so that you can quickly read.  You can do this by making sure that: your text is ordered and you can easily glance over it;  the content is correctly displayed on the screens of mobile devices;  using visual content with a minimum of text. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/02b/ed8/dbf/02bed8dbf30e4541b213af1ddd32f675.jpg">  Konstantin Makarov, CEO of <a href="https://sendpulse.com/">SendPulse</a> </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/296248/">https://habr.com/ru/post/296248/</a></p>
