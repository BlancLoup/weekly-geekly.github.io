  <section class="page js-page"><h1>Technical Director Qiwi namainil 500,000 bitcoins, that is 2.4% of the theoretically possible amount</h1><div class="post__text post__text-html js-mediator-article">  The head of Qiwi, Sergey Solonin, at a <a href="https://rb.ru/story/solonin-lecture/">lecture</a> at the Moscow School of Communications, told an interesting story, as in the Qiwi terminals mine bitcoins. <br><br>  According to Solonin, his subordinate "secretly naminil 500,000 bitcoins at the Qiwi terminals."  It was still in the days when mining was carried out on the CPU, at about that time the first software GPU miner appeared, but it was very buggy and only worked on several models of Nvidia cards: <br><br>  ‚ÄúI got into blockchain by chance.  In 2011, we had <b>more than 100,000</b> self-service terminals.  Somehow, the security chief came to me and said that the terminals that are in stores, at night, when there are no people, they transmit something and generally work very intensively, there is a big load, ‚Äùsaid Sergey Solonin.  ‚ÄúIn three months, he naminil 500 thousand bitcoins, and it cost $ 5 million.  And now it's billions! ‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Sergey Solonin is very interested in this topic.  It turned out that the technical director earned more on the use of terminals than the company earned on commission from payments through these terminals.  In other words, the CTO has found a more efficient way to use these terminals.  Solonin immediately asked him to explain to him what bitcoins are and what it means to ‚Äúmine‚Äù: ‚ÄúNot a topic for yourself!  - he says.  ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt know how to earn three kopecks on these stupid terminals, but here we have a gold mine!‚Äù

      "I invited the techir to me and said:" You used the resources of the company, so, firstly, return, and secondly, tell me what the hell you do that you mine. "  And he got a letter of resignation and replied: ‚ÄúWell, firstly, no, I will not return, and secondly, I will quit.‚Äù  I let him go, and it was impossible to do anything: well, I remembered something, there was no direct loss, I did not cause damage - only to landlords who pay for electricity somewhere. ‚Äù <br><br>  After that, Solonin urgently convened managers and said that bitcoins should be minted at all terminals. <br><br>  Three months later, the project was launched, but it was too late.  GPU miners entered into the business and the complexity of mining has increased dramatically. <br><br>  Still, the company learned useful experience from this story: ‚ÄúThis topic has since become interested, I plunged into it and became one of the first to invest in cryptocurrency,‚Äù said Sergei Solonin.  - Our company had people who were engaged in chips, in particular, to speed up the mining process, and now the whole mining takes place on specialized equipment, which we produce and sell to those who ‚Äúdig‚Äù.  Now we are dealing with a chip that accelerates artificial intelligence and must multiply increase the capacity of neural networks, create their base ... An enormous infrastructure is being created in the world: we don‚Äôt see it, but it is really very large.  In particular, in Iceland, where we have large mining centers and where we have been present and developed for three years already. ‚Äù <br><br>  Returning to the technical director, if he really namainil 500 thousand bitcoins, then this is 2.4% of the total theoretically possible number of bitcoins (21 million).  Based on the current Bitcoin price of $ 8187, his fortune can be estimated at $ 4.09 billion. <br><br>  Well, to compile a new list of Forbes billionaires, it is advisable to find out who was the technical director of Qiwi in 2011. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/418325/">https://habr.com/ru/post/418325/</a></p>
