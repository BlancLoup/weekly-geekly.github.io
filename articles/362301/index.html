Namely - to hold presentations, go to exhibitions or, as in our case, go to Moscow Startup Day.  At once I will tell separate thanks <b>geektimes</b> !  Due to the fact that we posted an article about our project and received competent feedback, we decided to go to the event with the slogan: ‚ÄúThe main event for startups and those who are interested in them.‚Äù <br><a name="habracut"></a><br>  Well, let's leave the slogans and titles alone, the post is not about that.  Post I want to write on my own behalf and share the opinion that you just need to take on any presentation of the project startup.  The following list of 25 things allowed me not only to feel confident at the presentation, but also to help my neighbors in the stands.  And help - it does not pass without a trace.  This and communication, and additional dating.  In addition, at the very beginning, it is these people who have to talk about what the project is.  And if they do not understand, then, in my opinion, no one will understand you. <br><br>  So.  <b>List of 25 necessary things for any presentation of a startup project</b> :

      1. Tripod for photo-video shooting; <br>  2. Extension; <br>  3. Roll Up; <br>  4. Charging; <br>  5. Diary; <br>  6. Handout; <br>  7. Laptop; <br>  8. Headphones; <br>  9. Uubik Rubik; <br>  10. Camera; <br>  11. Stickers with adhesive tape; <br>  12. Blank A4 sheets; <br>  13. Pencils and pens; <br>  14. Markers; <br>  15. Business cards; <br>  16. Fashion magazine; <br>  17. Clean non carbonated water; <br>  18. HD video camera; <br>  19. Adhesive tape; <br>  20. Paper napkins; <br>  21. Optical mouse with charged battery; <br>  22. A small towel; <br>  23. Lunch; <br>  24. Wi-fi router with charging wire; <br>  25. And finally, a good suit. <br><br>  * Also added multituls, but you need to make sure in advance that with him you will be missed, all the same - piercing and cutting. <br><br>  I would like to touch on the purpose of certain items from the list in a bit more detail.  Because it is clear that the Rubik's cube is needed, as without it.  After all, every start-up necessarily carries with him a cube from Rubik in his well-worn backpack (I saw in the movie).  I will try to group the obvious items and not burden the post. <br><br>  <b>Tripod for photo-video shooting and the actual camera and HD video camera</b> <br><br>  Tip of the day: set the tripod at the very beginning with a video camera.  Let him write down how you assemble the stand, how you place the objects on the table, how nervous you are.  All this is invaluable material for the video.  The tripod is recognized to help from shaking hands and generally release these hands for more important work.  And the work at the beginning is enough. <br><br>  Photo try to do a lot.  Immediately see how the light falls, so I was told.  But I do not know how to work with this and just set up a camera at the very beginning of the presentation at my discretion.  Then you definitely will not have time for this.  The camcorder, of course, format HD. <br><br>  <b>Extension</b> <br><br>  It is desirable with a variety of inputs - the filter, out of habit, many are called "pilot". <br>  You will need to insert there all the charging from laptops, from the phone, perhaps from the camcorder.  And, of course, to share with the neighbors, they did not know that the outlet was one for all. <br><br>  <b>Roll up</b> <br><br>  Very cool thing!  I learned about the existence of such a thing literally one day before the event (actually, that we also learned that our application was completed the day before).  Therefore, publish a photo.  For people like me: <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4c9/96a/472/4c996a47281845ab9fe2bf2dfc16a608.jpg"><br><br>  Roll Up is a very simple, efficient and convenient device.  In just a few seconds you get a ready-made mini stand.  He understands quickly, going instantly.  Lightweight and very transportable, as sold immediately with a convenient carrying bag. <br><br>  <b>Charging</b> <br><br>  There are such laws: the law of a discharged laptop at the most crucial moment of the presentation and the law of a discharged phone at the time of exchanging contact information with a potential client.  Exclude on the vine!  Take your charge with you.  Plus, by the morning all portable devices should have Full Level. <br><br>  <b>Handout</b> <br><br>  Probably the most important part, even more important than Roll Up, and in general more important than anything else.  Do not be lazy, do it!  No need to reinvent megadizayn.  Yes, it's good when you have a single style of everything: pens, notebooks, packages, you are all dressed the same.  But if you have a complex project that solves some specific target problem, as in our case, then all these notebooks and pens will be taken away from you just because it is a freebie.  And this client needs information that you decide specifically for him. <br><br>  Even the most common A4 sheet with brief abstracts will help not only to understand, but will also be your assistant.  Especially when completely different people come up and at some point it becomes really difficult to speak, either the music starts shouting loudly, or someone starts yelling at the microphone, and you already have a sore throat and your memory refuses, so you can just read the text "from the sheet" .  This is a serious "helper", I really was very glad that I was not lazy and made it. <br><br>  <b>Markers</b> <br><br>  I advise two colors, not more.  Moreover, one must be red.  To highlight the most important details: phone, domain name, name. <br><br>  <b>Wi-fi router</b> <br><br>  At major events, free Wi-fi is the thing that is still slowed down.  You need to show your project.  If this is a site, then it should work quickly and without errors.  In this case, you need to have your own Internet. <br><br>  <b>A good suit</b> <br><br>  Yes, you have to remove your favorite multi-colored sweater with a hood.  The costume not only disciplines you, but also those who will communicate with you.  Serious suit - serious customers. <br><br>  <b>Scotch tape</b> <br><br>  The thing necessary for any presentation.  Quickly glue something, fasten, fasten.  At the neighbors, the Roll Up beam broke and the poster crashed down with a terrible sound.  Scotch solves such problems quickly and without the "dust". <br><br>  The rest of the things are quite obvious and understandable.  I am sure this post will be useful, but such things as a fashion magazine and headphones are not.  Because I took them in case the Lord did not bring.  Those.  in case of complete failure.  Fortunately, not needed.  The project was interested in and in general the event was quite successful. <br><br>  I can also share my experience on how to get involved in the exhibition of start-ups and how to create business cards, stands, handouts for the presentation of your project, starting from the prototype and up to ‚Äúcome and take‚Äù, in 4 hours of evening Friday.  Of course, if it is interesting to someone. </div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/362301/">https://habr.com/ru/post/362301/</a></p>
