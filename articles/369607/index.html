Let's try to tell what registration notification is, what its absence threatens, how to buy electronic devices abroad, and what to do if the parcel has stopped at customs. <br><a name="habracut"></a><br><br><h3>  What is a "notification"? </h3><br>  Under the strange word ‚Äúnotification,‚Äù the whole phrase ‚Äú <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F">notification of registration in the registry of encryption devices</a> ‚Äù is hidden.  Notification is the permission of the Federal Security Service of Russia for the import of electronic equipment containing encryption modules.  Notification is issued for a specific device model.  This concept appeared by the <a href="http://www.consultant.ru/document/cons_doc_LAW_178556/">Decision of the Board of the Eurasian Economic Commission (EEC) of April 21, 2015 No. 30 (ed. November 17, 2015) ‚ÄúOn measures of non-tariff regulation‚Äù</a> and refers to all types of electronic devices that to some extent obviously use encryption, the list which is published in the <a href="http://www.ifcg.ru/registraciya-notifikaciy-fsb/docs/perechen-2.19.html">List of encryption tools (List 2.19)</a> . <br><br><h3>  What products are required notification? </h3><br>  The note to List 2.19 states that for the purposes of using the above list, one should be guided both by the name of the goods (that is, the name and description of the goods should imply encryption functions) and the code of the list of the <a href="https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%25D0%25A2%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B2%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B0%25D1%258F_%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BB%25D0%25B0%25D1%2582%25D1%2583%25D1%2580%25D0%25B0_%25D0%25B2%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%2588%25D0%25BD%25D0%25B5%25D1%258D%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25BC%25D0%25B8%25D1%2587%25D0%25B5%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B9_%25D0%25B4%25D0%25B5%25D1%258F%25D1%2582%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BB%25D1%258C%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D1%2581%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8_%25D0%25A2%25D0%25B0%25D0%25BC%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B6%25D0%25B5%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BD%25D0%25BE%25D0%25B3%25D0%25BE_%25D1%2581%25D0%25BE%25D1%258E%25D0%25B7%25D0%25B0">goods nomenclature of foreign trade activities of the Customs Union</a> ( <b>TNVED TS</b> ).  In this regard, customs officers often require to provide a notification if the HS code coincides with the code of products <a href="http://minpromtest.ru/uslugi/notifikaciya-fsb/kody_tn_ved_notifikatsii/">included</a> in the list of encryption (cryptographic) means, approved by the Decision of the Board of the Eurasian Economic Commission No. 30 of April 21, 2015 on Non-tariff Regulation measures whether the device supports encryption or not.

      Thus, the solutions include tablet computers and laptops (TNVED code 8471 30 0000), landline and mobile phones (codes <b>8517 11 0000</b> , <b>8517 12 0000</b> and <b>8517 18 0000</b> ), routers and routers ( <b>8517</b> ), software ( <b>8523</b> ) , chips ( <b>8542</b> ), desktop computers, walkie-talkies and transmitting devices, server systems and much more.  Due to the presence in the list of Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices that are wireless equipment for (c) encryption, absolutely any gadgets with the appropriate communication modules ‚Äî even wireless mice and keyboards ‚Äî are covered by the solutions.  By the way, RFID tags are a separate item, which also fall under the scope of this document based on the <a href="http://minpromtest.ru/o-tamozhennom-deklarirovanii-rfid-metok/">Letter of the FCS of Russia of June 3, 2016 No. 01-11 / 27111 ‚ÄúOn the customs declaration of RFID tags‚Äù</a> . <br>  A detailed list of categories of goods subject to mandatory notification on the territory of the EAEU can be found, for example, here. <br><br><h3>  How does it work for an ordinary buyer? </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/4e3/49d/134/4e349d13428e48adb85a48fa1e67029f.jpg"><br><br>  The most obvious example of the action of the above-mentioned Solution is the purchase of a smartphone abroad.  If you refer to a well-known resource devoted to portable technology, you can find messages (for example, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DSOOAbFFYAD4">first</a> , <a href="http://4pda.ru/forum/index.php%3Fshowtopic%3D692455%26st%3D820">second</a> , <a href="https://tjournal.ru/p/moto-g-no-in-russia">third</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch%3Fv%3DZtaGj_MLnZ4%26feature%3Dyoutu.be">fourth</a> ) that the Russian customs service impedes the receipt of smartphones from China and the United States. <br>  It happens like this: at the post office, along with the long-awaited package, there is a customs notification about the absence of notification of the smartphone to the EAEU.  Such a parcel, according to the law, is not issued and offers to contact the customs officers.  In turn, the customs officers refuse to process the necessary documents due to the already mentioned Decision.  And here the problem begins, because: <br><br>  a) officially give notice to legal entities <br>  b) the cost of notification begins (according to Google search results) from 11,500 rubles. <br><br>  For official sales in Russia and countries of the Eurasian Customs Union, the notification of the FSB is issued either by electronics manufacturers or distributors.  It guarantees the invariance of the encryption algorithms specified in the document until the specified date, and this notification is sufficient for all mailings.  It is important that the notification can be distributed both on the entire model range, assembled under a certain letter, and on one specific model of the device, which has a name with a precision of up to a comma. <br>  Most brands that do not officially sell in Russia do not have such documents.  Not have the notification and many modifications of the device, intended for sales in the markets of Europe, Asia or North America.  This means that the mailing with the import gadget can be delayed. <br><br><h3>  What to do if you really want? </h3><br>  In fact, the need for notification should not become a reason for refusing to purchase the desired device if consumer electronics are purchased for personal use.  Devices without notification do not accept courier delivery services.  But regular and express mail do not pay attention to such trifles. <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">If you</a> use the services of <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Pochtoy.com</a> (or any other carrier), the transportation of goods without notification by courier services will be refused. <br>  If there is a big price difference, you can always take a risk (unless, of course, the method of payment is <a href="https://www.paypal.com/ru/home">PayPal</a> ).  Dispatches are checked selectively, and, for example, smartphones, tablets and laptops without notification consistently come from China and the United States to Russia (just read the <a href="http://pochtoy.com/reviews/">reviews</a> on our website).  But there are other methods. <br><br><h3>  We receive written permission from the FSB to import </h3><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/779/550/0da/7795500da7604253b3d569e4ca2e0777.jpg"><br>  For devices purchased for personal use (it‚Äôs important - there can be no more than 2 devices in the package, this coincides with the requirements of many suppliers for the transportation of batteries) you can try to get official permission of the Federal Security Service to import. <br>  When a parcel with a request for notification arrives at the post office, the buyer is notified of its arrival, but not given.  It is transferred for safekeeping and sealed.  Instead, postal workers transmit a package of documents for communication with customs authorities.  Further work of the mail with the specified parcel is possible only with the sanction of the customs authorities.  (Most often this happens when the allowed monthly duty-free import limit is exceeded, if a duty is paid, but it can happen due to the lack of notification in Russia.) <br>  After receiving the documents in the mail, you must write a letter to the FSB, after collecting the following documents: <br><ol><li>  Extract from the bank with a stamp about payment of the goods. </li><li>  Application ( <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B7qctffa39OzNVlYemJiQkJmWkk/view%3Fusp%3Dsharing">form</a> ). </li><li>  Description of the device (manufacturer, model, specifications, operating system version). </li><li>  Order confirmation from the store in the form of screenshots. </li><li>  Scanned the first and second pages of the passport. </li><li>  Notification from customs. </li></ol><br>  All documents must be collected in a PDF file.  A letter with him should be sent to the address fsb@fsb.ru and / or through the <a href="http://www.fsb.ru/fsb/webreception.htm">web</a> site on fsb.ru.  The letter should be issued as follows: <br><br><blockquote><h4>  Headline </h4><br>  To the Center for Licensing, Certification and Protection of State Secrets of the FSB of Russia (TsLSZ FSB of Russia) <br><br><h4>  Text of the letter </h4><br><blockquote>  Hello. <br>  Acquired from the online store (store name): <br>  1. Device (make and model) - 1 pc. <br>  To receive a parcel, the customs service requires a one-time permit for the import of non-certified funds into the territory of the Russian Federation for personal use. <br>  Package of documents in the attachment. </blockquote></blockquote><br><br>  The service has the right to respond within a month.  Despite the fact that the Federal Security Service officially stopped issuing such formal replies back in 2010, many buyers receive a positive response.  Unfortunately, this procedure is entirely dependent on the human factor.  With a good deal, permission to import will appear very quickly. <br>  Its printout, together with the already collected documents, must be sent to the customs office that wrote out the requirement for notification (together with the postal notification).  It remains to write an explanation, which, together with a full package of documents is transmitted to the customs inspector.  After some time, workers will put on the mail notification stamp "Import is allowed", and the parcel can be picked up. <br><br><img src="https://habrastorage.org/files/644/5bc/393/6445bc39331c4f449afe4d42ec270c69.jpg"><br><br>  <b>Attention!</b>  The package will be stored at the post office for no more than 30 days, after which the process of its return will begin.  With a long clearance, it is necessary to extend the shelf life by contacting the post office.  But this service is paid. <br><br><h3>  And if there is no time, but the benefit is great? </h3><br>  There are a number of companies involved in product certification, customs clearance and registration of notification.  Nearest prompts Google.  The largest of them are: <br><br><ul><li>  <a href="http://minpromtest.ru/uslugi/notifikaciya-fsb/">"Minpromtest"</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://certificate.moscow/%25D0%259D%25D0%25BE%25D1%2582%25D0%25B8%25D1%2584%25D0%25B8%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B0%25D1%2586%25D0%25B8%25D1%258F-%25D0%25A4%25D0%25A1%25D0%2591">"Certificate. Moscow"</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://clsz.fsb.ru/docs/pktn.htm">Center for Licensing, Certification and Protection of State Secrets of the Federal Security Service of Russia</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://www.ifcg.ru/registraciya-notifikaciy-fsb/">IFCG</a> ; </li><li>  <a href="http://radiocert.ru/fsb.php">RadioCert</a> . </li></ul><br>  When contacting their employees will issue everything for 10-15 thousand rubles.  As "physicists", as well as legal entities.  After that, it remains to go to the post office and pick up the goods.  The difference in prices between the Russian market and Amazon can reach up to 30-50%, and with the high cost of the goods - everything will pay off.  You can make a notification in the clubhouse - it does not apply to a separate device, but to all devices of this model. <br><br><h3>  Should I make a purchase in this case? </h3><br>  You can save money by not only buying gadgets for sales in other markets.  On Amazon or eBay, you can purchase the same devices as in Russia, but at lower prices.  Some manufacturers do not supply their products for the mass user.  In both cases, it is worthwhile to clarify the presence of a notification <a href="https://portal.eaeunion.org/sites/odata/_layouts/15/portal.eec.registry.ui/directoryform.aspx%3Fviewid%3D859ec98d-f4fe-423a-b6bc-d01b53fd4b7c%26listid%3D0e3ead06-5475-466a-a340-6f69c01b5687%26itemid%3D232">here</a> .  If it is on the list - you can safely buy. <br>  <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">Our</a> statistics say that despite the lack of notification for many devices from the USA, they are actively sold to Russia.  Sometimes it is worth the risk. <br><br>  I would like to collect and other statistics.  We are looking forward to your comments on the requirements of the FSB notifications at customs - maybe <a href="http://pochtoy.com/">it‚Äôs time for us to improve the Pochtoy.com service</a> and offer not only delivery, but also receiving notifications? <br></div><p>Source: <a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/369607/">https://habr.com/ru/post/369607/</a></p>
